Sports Radio 560WCAM Miami Fort Lauderdale presents the Neil Rogers show. We're talking about the Neil called 560560 Cold Free for David Broward, or Pound 560 on your cell phone. The audience of Neil is guest, Paul Erzert. Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WCQA and easily read acquisitions for the measly broadcast booth? Now, Neil Rogers, on Sports Radio 560QAAM. I swear we're so sorry. James is Rodman. He goes knocking over the TV, he's using green. He's so sorry. James is Rodman. But the pan needs time with heavy and twisted your eyes and things. A spill jack sick, not the point, ladies. He said your baby's a deep, but not dressing cool to teeth. He has to feel it by wearing something on their teeth, but you're going to call. We're talking just, you can see his basketball. You look pretty tired, it's pretty tired. You're a chair, I didn't put all that on my mind. You look pretty tired, it's pretty tired. You're a chair, I didn't put all that on. That is not much to think about for me all to go. Thank you. You're my rule of the town. That is happening for me to take it on our own. I'll take it off the side, and then let's take it down. I'm on my way home. You're a good girl. You're a good girl. You're a good girl. You're a good girl. I'm on my way home. You're a good boy, darling. They started, we're standing there, we're in touch all the time. I'm on my way home. You're a good boy, we're in touch all the time. Okay, so this is a marriage. setting up. You're a couple of weeks ago. to that morning show of ours on a way in and I have the white is that was the last time I turned him on to the car. Oh boy, he can't even rebound, what are we bound around, what can he rebound? Dallas Maverick's gave up on their biggest drawing card when they were releasing him hours after he langed out again against owner in waiting mark Cuban. He was ejected twice with the rockets just bed in once and find $13,500. He's a skumbag. He's a disgusting subhuman piece of crap. But nevertheless, they'll confuse the sports nerds with that and I'm discovering from our pull yesterday from the results I have in my hand right now. The sports nerds, they just don't get it. We asked yesterday should Dan Moreno retire sign with the Minnesota Vikings or plan other year with the dolphins. We had 692 respondents far away, our biggest response to the course you'd expect that because I mean this is a lot more important than done control things like that. Huh? Of course it is. Well, no, I asked for a thousand boats. We got 692 and the thing was down from about 330 did not. Why is that? Yeah, we lost a lot of boats. I was broken for 6 hours. So, what anyway, we had 692 boats. 3602 said that he should retire was just 52.3% just over 52%. Said Danny, retire. 36.1% that's 250 people said he should sign with the Minnesota Vikings. And 80 people only 11.5% said another year for the dolphins, which of course is ridiculous because the dolphins want to back? No, no. In spite of what anybody is lying about these days. They don't want to back. Who they? No. But the thing that's shocking to me is that just almost 50% think that he ought to continue playing somewhere. Shocking astonishing. They're in denial. There would clear a patch of baby. Where are they? Oh, they're in denial. Man, that is astonishing to me. Almost as astonishing as this. I find his literature that I had sit around in the car that I hadn't thrown out yet. And I'm really glad I didn't throw it out yet. It's the prospectus for the class A common stock of Beasley Broadcast Group Inc. Today on the program of beginning the first and a 700-part series of why not to buy Beasley Broadcasting stock. We're only going to be covering this four hours a day for the next 45,000 days. No, seriously. I'm looking at on page 50 to this prospectus. Remember that show family affair? That's what this is all about. Principal stockholders and somebody was telling me just in the last 24 hours that people at invest aren't too crazy about companies where like it's incestuous. We're all the stockholders. All the big, I mean, all the people in the family are like, uh, got some kind of a title. You know, they're all the board members and so on. So with kind of an incestuous relationship on you know, I mean, by that. Uh-huh. Kind of like we have around here a queue aim, although they're not all related. They're like kissing cousins, you know, the inner circle jerk. And I see like George G. Beasley's got almost 14 million shares of common class Beas stock in Beasley Broadcasting and Bruce G. Beasley's got one and a half million and Beacare aligned Beasley. She's got her 1.3 million and Brian E. Beasley has got 420,000. And then there are a couple of other guys. One name Mark Fowler who used to be the chairman of the FCC who's got a poultry 10,000 shares of class A stock. So basically it's a family affair. Uh-huh. And when I take a good look at this and when I see that the price that closing yesterday was 12 and a half bucks, it makes me feel real good that I didn't pay any of this stock. And then when I find out this morning from George that we have somebody at hand a building at a moment, she named because I'm sure he needs the job. Somebody in the building who's old like over two grand. So you know I'm choking out in a little piece of potato. Oh god, where did that come from? Where's the name of that place? Don't say it. Anyway, oh seriously I'm choking on that and that's got punishing me because we had a huge meal at the macaroni grill last night. Nice to see my good buddy JP. That information, no JP, the flyers treated Michael Renberg to his Phoenix. That was correct, but not for Keith Kitchuk for Rick Tocker. Just a small difference. You're still number one in my book JP. That's for you. Now what time was I just saying? I thought an expense account. Oh yeah about that expense account. For over $2,000 for the company said, well you just go ahead and pay for it yourself and we'll reimburse you right away, which was months and months ago. Did this person ever get reimbursed? And see you have to wonder about that because $22,200 for like most of the people who work around here. That's a pretty good amount of cash. That's a sizable amount of money to put out your own pocket. When the boss man says, oh you just go ahead and fork it out and we'll pay right back. Let me say it again. Did he ever get paid back? No. No. Now I have to raise both of my eyebrows way up in here when I see that a company that's got millions and millions of shares of their own stock here. Which even at 10 bucks a share if I had 1.4 if I had 13 cheeses Christ if I had 14 million shares and it was only 10 bucks a share That comes out to 140 million bucks. Sounds like to me. I think I could squeeze by on that and probably take I would take good care of all the good people in this building all four five of them. If I had that 140 million bucks. So you have to wonder on the one hand see when people are encouraging you to invest in a company that's going to do this and go to the By the way, is our phone system installed yet? No. The new phone system which I told you the three boxes showed up yesterday Is it installed yet? No. Does the office phone in here is that working yet today? No. No. See there's no sense of immediacy. Don't push these people. They don't want to be pushed. Don't you get it Mr. They don't want to be pushed. You're getting pushy and they don't want to be pushed. We'll get his 2300 bucks back when they're good and ready when they feel like it. Just like what mad dog comes in here Expect to get paid for like the last three four six months whatever for doing those shows those great shows that you guys on his station When they're good and ready when they get around with they don't like being pushed. Don't you get it? 9 minutes after 10 on the 550 WQA are pull question today. Of course has to do with affirmative action. We'll get to that in a second I heard some real crap yesterday On his show from people out there who just did don't want to get it affirmative action. The answer is still Absolutely positively all divided affirmative action If you can't compete go shuffle your feet. That's my suggestion to right on out the door Yeah, that's right. That's what the Johnny Cochrane says if you cannot compete go shuffle those feet In the opposite direction because you ain't going to be getting hired No portion of his broadcaster. No Without the express written permission of WQAM if we read acquisition or this case stands for nothing Wilson to another recession of his side lifeless florida Dressed in the easel list this hour guest today.

Thank you. I'm looking forward to a 10 15 at 5.60 W to QAM our poll question today on our website on Neorunji's.com is very simple Now we had almost 700 hosts. We had a head that bet you a lot more than that if we wouldn't have been off for six hours because a lot of people do vote in the morning I noticed no sense but today right we had almost 700 And I bet you we get close to our thousand if we can keep the thing going next 24 hours if we don't overload it Do you support a form of interaction yes or no? What an easy question and of course the answer is no I'm not sure so I had a one influence the way you're gonna be voting Do you support a form of interaction? No yes or no no no no Don't do that because then you influence the way you like you want to fix the result Because the stuff that I heard yesterday I can't get over it. I really can't The likes to with some people will go to try to rationalize the fact that they are lazy and they Want to continue to be pampered and look at for a handouts and special treatment the answer. Let me say it again is oh no I say how about a affirmative action for ugly people Short people short people old people People they're howl lip Yeah Handicraft people oh they have it what the handicraft the idea They got some kind of disability act as evidence something like that well screw them too No, I said why should some gimp get a job just because they happen to be unfortunate enough to be gimpy I mean if they can do the job well I say more power to them to salute But other than that no way Jose you go when you're in your compete and if you can't get the job done better Anybody else go go do something else go flip a hamburgers go work for a bow jangle get out of my face Not complex at all These stories these convoluted stories I was getting from this audience yesterday and it's really interesting How when we talk about things of general interest to the community or to the country and people are shooting your kids and all these all of these other things That we don't generally hear from certain minority groups in this community and then all I have to do is mentioned Whether if I mention Ali on we get to you at all it today is the big day in court. Do we want to hear about that? No, no, we don't want to hear about it. I don't care I don't care what the judge says. I don't know I couldn't care less If I never hear that name again, it'll be too soon for me Ali on But if we start talking about that you get the predictive response because like I've told you before Most people are at pigeon hold themselves they're professional F**k fill in the blank whatever that might be and I don't have any patience for that. I'm not have no interest in that So this garbage that we heard yesterday this comparative mystery and misery comparative suffering. Oh, yeah Well, the Jews and the Jews what last time I checked Jews got pretty good jobs. They got an education And they went out there in They lawyers doctors dentist I'm talking about real dentist not only dentist in highly real dentist Broadcast is whatever it is a stock brokers Every group every minority group that has ever come to this country and by the way more recently More recently than some people came here in crates 300 years ago every minority group that's come here suffered tremendous discrimination The Italians the Irish the Jews the polls air me single group the Catholics Religious groups ethnic groups every minority that's ever come here suffered tremendous prejudice and is that overcome enormous hurdles Have they looked for handouts? Oh, have they gotten handouts most of them? Oh no They did it themselves And this this attempt that these colors that were calling in yesterday are dark friends out there And you're out in strata compare themselves with the Jewish people because they can change their name Guess what ugly people can they change the way they look No, only I wish no And you know as well as I do that ugly people don't get hired as quickly as good looking people if you happen to be lucky enough to have been born with the right jeans And maybe wearing the right jeans and you look pretty good You got a much better chance to get in that job and if I happen to be the employer and I choose to and it's my decision to hire that person That's my business don't be telling me I got to hire some ugly bitch If you can compete go shuffle your feet Go beat your meat on the street It'll be a real treat Got a good scene and we go eat Five no seriously I have no patience for this don't try to sum me on a affirmative action crap This what it is and it's been called many times reverse discrimination and you know something that is absolutely correct That's exactly what it is It's trying it's trying to cure one evil by creating another one and it doesn't work it never has worked. It's never gonna work You can try to sell up to me from now until the end of time and can happen What was that what did I just hear through the window oh? I couldn't say it on the soccer. That's what I thought I heard Yeah, what is that?

Hello Hello, yes, sir I'm an angry black man and I'm something to say Angry as the black people who continue to live in the past and Don't realize that this is a year 2000. There's no need for a affirmative action if you're the same or better than your peers All it takes is motivation people wake up. You know if you're asking quit looking for a free dinner Get off your ass and if the problem really lies If we're talking about affirmative action, maybe at the university level if the problem lies I'm talking about any level. Well any level Look if there are differences in the economic or social classes If we're talking about a university and the students trying to get in there and they can't it's not because they're they're black Let me say that there let me show it now very quickly that there are a lot more poor white people in America Then there are poor black people. I agree not even a contest We don't have any quotas for poor white people in any college university any school anywhere in America Look if people are You're putting in the same amount of effort and and and and are the same Then they're going to be just that way. I mean we're we're not talking about slavery I hate when people bring in slavery and all this other stuff give me a freaking break. We owe this guy something We don't owe anybody anything. Okay.

They can't compete. That's it They're they're just that's what they're saying anyone in my opinion anyone that stands up for that Just telling anyone that here's them that they are inferior They are unable to compete. They will lose in a fair fight, right and you know I just can't see how a person could admit that to the world Secondly, it's you know the playing field in my opinion is at worst even And if anything it's probably slightly tilted in their favor, so if they will just simply apply them So they will succeed and that's all I can say.

Right. Yes. But you just don't care. I can't, you know, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him pee on demand all the time. So that's the best I can do for it.

Because all of us red, next, crack this in, says. But the story is the one over there. The dirty knees. Every human days are to chew. Don't do it, God, the night's at two. Don't like the way my daddy is watching me. Yeehaw, I was just waiting for that. I love that Yeehaw Junction. It's 1134-560WQA in. Here's the fact from Catherine who says the maniac, the coldiest today, about more than 100% of Jewish kids going to Jewish schools. She said he did have one good point. The kids at this market and the same education as kids at better neighborhoods. As the white kid was bus to Miami, Edison, seeing your high. And we weren't taking a side and giving better classes or better books. I had that same substandard, a secondary education to black kids. Where's the government imposed quota to make that up to me? Good point, Catherine. So we have a quota to make it up to her. No. No. You're just a whiter you lose. And how come the japs didn't we drop the bomb on WDW2 on Pearl Harbor? And Nagasaki, I mean Nagasaki, I mean Nagasaki, whatever that was. Hiroshima after they dropped the bomb on Pearl Harbor, Pearl whatever it was. That's what happened when you started talking too fast. Did these people know any different? No. Didn't we drop the guy dead bomb on Nagasaki and Hiroshima on a japs? And how come they're not screaming any old when they come over here? Then we owe them something. There's a bit of buying everything up to be this. Although at least we took care of the ones that we sent after the camp. Oh, we took care of them? Yes, we did. What do we do for that? We gave them a couple of bucks. Few. Okay. Few yen. What's the Japanese money? Yeah. Like I said. Put it in, right? Are they running around? Screaming? No. As a matter of fact, the Japanese people, just like the other Asian people who come over here, most of them highly educated have a very good work ethic and they're not running around looking for God in hand out. And screaming to be on about how we dropped the bomb on and that's why they got the one on the eye at the top of their forehead. So stop and think about that for a second. But all the other people and stop making all these goddamn excuses for looking for handouts and excuses for being lazy and shipless. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 60 and pound five, 60 on the AT&T line. Here's a mobile and palm beach, hello. Yes, sir. Hi. First of all, let me tell you about your phone system as you know. I was dialing and dialing and rings and then it goes to busy and then it kicks your off. Just thought of what you know. And as far as the, as far as the, as far as something this, this company, there's somebody in this place ought to be just tied up in the thrown in the middle of the road somewhere. This is just such an unbelievable place where all this money that they're raising with all these men, all the way they run around acted like big shots. And at the meantime, they won't lift a goddamn finger to anything for us in here. It's pathetic. It's criminal. It is absolutely criminal. Well, we feel for you out here. As this school bus drivers, I drive a truck all day. Yes, sir. On the road and I watch these school bus drivers in the morning, in the afternoon. And I'll tell you, I have two children that are an elementary school in Broward County. And my wife and I go out of our way, no matter what day, no matter what time. One of us takes them to school and one of them takes them up because we will not put our kids on a school bus driven by these people. And I, you know, I talk to friends and a lot of people who are educated, who do the same thing. No matter what their schedule is, they'll take care of their kids. They love their children. They don't want to take a chance or reading about something about their kids in the newspaper. And I remember as a kid, growing up, it doesn't seem to me that we've met young adults driving the buses. And I say young adults, I remember as a kid, the school bus drivers were like, you know, in the 30s or 40s. And I guess they got paid enough to make a living to go. They were just putting the job, they earned their jobs. And that's all I wanted to say. Okay, good luck, pal. Thanks. Thanks. We need it. This phone. I'm about ready to do it. This thing have like the other one there. That's it. Oh, yeah. I can disconnect that. I think what I'm going to do during the break. I'm just going to disconnect that whole phone and get everything. I'm just going to leave it through the wall. I think I'm just about ready to do that because I realized that the other thing is on the floor. And any day now they're going to get the other part and yada yada yada yada. Yeah, just like they're going to fix this other phone over here on the inside that don't work. But I mean, you finally reach a point and you say, this is not acceptable. Okay, you're not doing it, baby. And if I had a real lawyer instead of somebody that's running around with his bag at magazine, if I had a real lawyer, we just sued their ass a long time ago already. I'd have that guy then $50 million and be living the life of a Riley somewhere. Instead of sitting here and having to go through this experiment every day, even Alexander Graham Schwartz never went through something like this. Like this. No, and then by the way, maybe or like this. Yeah, like that. You can't complain about the technology and be easily broadcasting because quite frankly, there isn't any, at least not anistudio. Can't get it done. Oh, yeah, but she is only two and a half years later and it's here and we're working on it. And I got my thumb up my ass. See if I had all that stock like he's got that's worth like $6 million proportionally. I'd be walking around making excuses for those partners and crime of his two. If I had an IQ and a minus column and I had all those millions of dollars worth of stock, I'd be running around saying, Oh, yeah, well, the moon and the sun and the stars and but it would be a better. Oh, yeah, and by the way, pay what's his name. I'm 23 and a bucks you cheap bastard you. You grave robbers. I mean, it's one thing to be selfish and greedy, but these people, this company has taken it to a new level. To an entirely different level. Oh, yeah, all new people will give it the honor of buying our stock at full price so we can boost the value up there for our own fun and profit. So we can squeeze back some of the money out of the poultry books that were paying these poor bastards around this place. And by the way, anybody want to buy a T-shirt for 50 bucks? No. 24 known in 560 WQMs. You're listening through wheels for 3DL. 4DL, 560, you A-M at the prime. And welcome to rhythmic theatre, a collection of flying literary works has performed by that societal element. Most likely to consume large quantities of ethanol containing the thick-pair sisters wedding. Which, and to daily happens to be their wedding as well. Today's presentation is the subject tale that is Richard, Mr. Fettett. Now, as a winner, our David Contire, they quarrely and thunder by the sun of York. And all the clouds of the verb upon our health in the deep, bosom of the old shivers. Oh, I'm simply not going to spend the next time for another philosophy. In addition, I'm threatening. All right, all right next all the time. You'll be astonished to be shocked. This will knock your socks right off. We just got the first results on our poll today from the Eric. And more than 100% of you are opposed to a affirmative action. That's what he said. We got 128 votes. 119 are saying, no. Oh, and only nine are saying yes. Lifetime, I checked that's 172%. Ain't it something like that? 400% are against affirmative action. How do you like that? That's our poll question on neorogers.com today. We want to get a thousand votes by tomorrow. So we get a good accurate sampling out there. Are you affirmative action? Are you for it? Do you support it? Do you be wanting it? Yes or no? Yeah, you're nay. So far, 600% are saying no. Kiss it goodbye. Here's a mobile in Gainesville, hello. Hey, I'll call me or John Gainesville. How are you? Okay, John. I actually, I'm headed down your way. I just bought gas on the turn bike. A book, 74 gallon for 87 octane. Wow. Yeah, just passed you know. Like I said, trying to bomb the Arabs man, it's long passed, too. No, I want affirmative action. And I just wanted you know, how glad I am to hear your voice. I was down the second week of January. And I heard of all people on the radio. Shoredch. Oh, I got to blow my brains out. Yeah. Hey, he shot the... Hey, George, you can answer the phone for a Cuban, but now on the radio, you are terminal. Yeah. It was the abs. I'm gonna make sure it's your. It was the worst. Okay, dude. Yeah, I appreciate it. Hey, including. Yeah. Alan Parsons, the president. Okay. Come on. It's a project. What's the number? He's done like your show. That's where it goes. Okay, me. You like him? You don't like him? That's just the way it is. Okay, he's just a little spick. Who's, uh, got his thing. That out of town number 87775634587785. Oh, by the way. Not for on the year, but for off the obogas you already know all the inside secrets there with the genina. Don't you, George? What is it? I can't say it on the year. You know, Joe, Joe's girlfriend, our lovely good friend, Genina. Yes. Well, you must, since you and Joe go and she and the crystal and the whole, well, bunch, you go to the swing club together. You know, I'm not going to be talking about her. You don't already know. But I'll sign up during the break. Okay, 560505060 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Any other one on? How are you doing here? Pretty good. I've been listening to you since I was in diapers. First time I've had the opportunity to share this crappy phone system. All right. Listen, I, let me ask you a question. Is there any kind of quotas on black owned businesses and how many whites they need to hire? No. No, we're not. Of course not. I've got a lot more than like I'm a Cuban owned business. How many angles they have to be heard now? Okay. I was just curious about that. That's why it's called reverse discrimination. Right. And you know, it's funny because I think the blacks are much more discriminating than we are. I mean, you get, you can have a black eye walk through a white neighborhood and nobody pay any mind to him. Now, you try getting a white eye walking through a black neighborhood. You can let you make it out of there. Now, wait, I'm going to say that again. A black eye could walk through a white neighborhood and nobody will pay any attention to him. I'm saying, you know, maybe you've got to be kidding man, especially if he's like real real dark and looks like a dangerous and big. I'm saying just the regular, you know, just the black imposing looking like OJ has an ascetic in his hand. Well, that's a little different. A little bit there, the horse of a different color, right. You're right. Your right. I guarantee you wanting it. If you be walking through a neighborhood, you'll sit up and take notice. Trust me when I tell you. Why do we need to go to the pleasure and have a great day pal? 560505050 what about you George? Big black guy walks through your neighborhood and kind of like pacing back and forth and from the sidewalk right in front of your house. I keep an eye on him. Exactly. That's what Columbus said. 56050505050 this line eight and line four things get to be really pondress, you know what? She's going to speak to me or what? I think I'm not going to die. You need to make a car. I don't think you're talking. Please know where for a real radio station if you'd like to make a car. Because you're inside phone that window worker either. So if I did want to make a car, I couldn't do that. Oh no, what just happened there? What was that? What was it? Did you see that? You were touching the phone either. The line four just had something. There is somebody. I want to announce it right now. Okay. Beyond the shadow of a doubt. Or maybe they picked it up in there. You think that could be it? That wouldn't make it light up in here. Somebody is dick in with our phone system. Now I realize you're dumb, Greg. I realize you're a little bit slow that nature didn't, you know, give you all the, oh man. Talk about a few brick short. He's like an apartment building short. But I don't care. How stupid you are. The fact is that Bell South is an impediment to our existence here. They should have been sued a long time ago or replaced or both of the above. Because Bell South, I want to go right on record today saying Bell South appears to be incapable of providing us with sponsor is that works on his radio program. Incapable or refuses to or both of the above again. Because I'm seeing things here with my naked eye today that quite frankly, make me raise all three eyebrows way up in a year and say, what the hell is this all about? Hey. But oh, we don't want to do that because, you know, that might cost us some money. No, let's go sue Waffen like they did. That was really productive a state. A station that doesn't even exist. They never had one diary in a ratings in six months yet. That nobody listens to accept the sports. They're the lifeless assholes around here who are busy, but placing bets with bookies all day. Oh, I heard that on Hank show yesterday. I wanted to vomit. You're good friend. Stoo got's in there and then whole bunch. They're like Hank juniors. I mean, see, Hank into what cause he actually makes a lot of money. And that's his business what he does with his money. And the same with Eddie K. Rams would GA. They're like adults. They want to be compulsive gamblers more power to him. That's their business. But all these little quizzlings around here. Oh, I took the overs and I got the under. Yeah, you got the under Pateloon. He's what you got. Stoo got. That's what you got. Squat. What's that out of town number? H777-785-6345. Oh, we just can't wait till we get Chris Moore and Boogback on in midday. So we can be all sports again. So we can get all the press conference design. Yeah, and then like three months after that, when the station is playing Hungarian rap cities, what are you going to do then sweetheart? Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. I just want to talk a little bit about the affirmative action. I am a employee of the State University system of Florida. Yeah. So we're several years and it missions and now I'm hiring agencies for its state agency. And it seems that both blacks and whites have a completely long idea about what affirmative action really is. Okay, well, straighten the sun. Affirmative action is supposed to work in tandem with equal opportunity. And all affirmative action that's supposed to do is take the direct action to make sure that all groups, male females, black, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, whatever. Having opportunity to get jobs or placement into universities or what have you. It's not supposed to be a quota system. There's a lot of black thing. It's not supposed to be a reverse discrimination. There's a lot of white thing. It's supposed to mean that, for instance, when we do hiring at the university, if we get a hiring pool and we have too many blacks. And if we have in several times too many blacks in the pool, we have to take a lot of blacks in a pool of white people jump right out. Well, every time every time. I've seen what we're supposed to do is to make sure that that pool is represented of the community, which is state agency is located. So we have too many blacks, too many women, the Hispanics, too many white. We're supposed to go back out into the pool and make sure that other groups are more managed up to snuff. Right. That it's up to snuff. And then once that even now gives all those people the same opportunity to get jobs. A lot of people, even hiring agents and managers, risk and students, that mean that we have to have so many women, we have to have so many white. And I think it's the best observation of this idea that gives people so well that. I think the students at the university get been out of shape because they think somehow they're going to lose the opportunity to university. If you belong there, you belong there. All they're saying is, if there's a job opening, then you need to put it in the Miami Harrel, you need to put it in the Miami Times, you need to put it in the Illinois Harrel. That way you know that the three largest communities in South Florida, for instance, have an off equal opportunity to know that a job is available. Yes. And that's all the front of action is. It's not a quarter system. And then you're a form of comment about reparations. But a certain action is actually reparations. And you're right, Japanese Americans have come here and have not asked reparations how, but the United States has given reparations to Japanese Americans who were in the term in camps. Yeah, I said that. That's what I said. But those weren't the people who were living in Japan when they were dropping the bombs on Hiroshima Nagasaki. Absolutely not. For what they did to their parents and grandparents and whatever, maybe to some of them. That's not the same thing. And any more than the Jews who survived the Holocaust were given reparations for what they suffered and what their ancestors had got nothing to do with. What Jewish Americans, what does that got to do with it? That's absolutely right. But I just wanted to clarify that. Yeah, well, I'm glad you clarified it. We're still against it. How do you like that? It's a little bit that's why your saying is theory. That's in theory. That's in theory. And I think that's the problem. The problem is even the people who are just like, how does the EEO bullcraft that we got in this business and every business, how are you hiring in America? It's got to go. No more. No more EEO. What do you suggest is alternatives though, because when we leave, they're apparently when we leave people to their own devices, they fall back on. And if the same goes for blacks or whites, people fall back on one, I'm going to hire good things. Well, let me ask you this, and again, in the date county, Yes, the businesses that are owned by Hispanics, how many anglers do they hire in those businesses? Not many. They saw that they saw another guy. Now, do you think that there ought to be some kind of a lot of force them to hire anglers if they don't want to? In a private company or a private? In a private company, they shouldn't act force people to hire people they don't want to hire. At the same time, we need to have laws and act to sort of people to act with discriminating against. There's a difference between that. What about, what about ugly people? A lot of people protect them and make sure they get a job. Say again? Hug me people. Well, we can't. Don't you admit that better looking people get jobs more often than ugly people? Well, that's true. I'm currently working on my doctorate and I'm part of that. It's part of my perception of people. Yeah. And yeah, please. Please, please. I'm doing a business up and for a suddenly people, OK, pal? We will. OK, thanks. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, on the AT&T, what? What's wrong with you, E.O.? I'll be employment opportunities. That's what I say. You E.O.? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, on the AT&T line. Pick it up and pound it. Something might happen. Out of time lines, open H7, 7, 8, 5, 60, 3, 45. A Neil Rogers show. Sports radio. 5, 60. 2, 8, and. Oh, I'm a head of the 400 day. Look at all the red deck girls to offer in the harron girls. Go into the bar, 2, get rings, rings. Getting beat by red next lap like what you see each night on top. There was put the c*** in country. Look at all the red decks that each lunch at Peter Husk. If their rings I'd wonder, Walmart shorts. They smell like an old wit, though they're pick up bright, dark, low, long, and Brothers in the lower two breeds of boards. But it tells me why. I'll travel at heart for life. Can't offer tomatoes to some head. Nippo rakes and belly fat and velvet. Each is welcome and serve brother plays the band joe in the tree. Take pride in her heritage. You'll say, we've tested you the best foundation of the Christian family. Born again. A praise the Lord. And thank them, your savers, when they're for war. What's with Jerry's ringer dude? Without those red decks, winners of the hood. What's the f***ing said? The ring. Probably two at five sixty W to come and blow. I'll tell you that Jason sure has ballooned up. No wonder he don't show his post in here very much anymore. Boy, do you see how fat he's gotten? Man, he must be pushing 262-272, which is an, uh, at least. 5-6705-60, pound five sixty on the AT&T line. I'll start forgot to tell you about my good friend, Janino during the break. Well, next break. Here's Miami, hello. Yeah, I just wanted to mention why the discrimination is, why don't you wait the discrimination? Why? When the discrimination is done, what's larger than when the discrimination is? It's bigger, that's the hysteria type. Yeah, it's bigger. Well, they, when they decide to use the discrimination against them, they'll just boycott you. They'll boycott the whole state of, well, is that the division thing? Yeah. And they split me down. Whatever. And they stick together and then they'll boycott you. And, and no mention of discrimination against white people. And, and it's terrible. And the affirmative action, it all like it, is because they believe it only black people could go to college. Only people could run and jump. Okay, well, you better start running right now, pal, because I think we got your number. 15,000 open lines here. Another one of these psychotic days. And of course, I'm sitting here at the phone. Is it us? Is it this audience? He never know. See, if we ever had a full system here, we could kind of like gauge what's really going on out there. But can we gauge it? No, no, we can't even get our thumb on it. 128 votes. So far, our poll, the question that this is a little bit behind the time. Our affirmative action, do you support it? Yes or no. 128 votes? 118 say no. No. And only 10 say yes. How do you like that? That's way over 100%. 560, 5050, 5060 on the AT&T line. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. Hey, New homes are going to be. Okay. The poll question is, answer is yes. Yeah. When you're poll question today, I don't get a chance to listen to you, and large number here at work. Now, what's going on in the phone line? Is that on your end or mind? Yeah, I guess it's on my mind. I'm doing that on several calls. I'm not working actually. Yeah. You got a crack on that work so well, that's great. Good match then. What I want to ask you about is, and I don't get a chance to listen to you that much. Did you have any comments we've been thinking to see the next one? Why are you whispering? I'm losing your service. Speaking of that thing. Can you hear me? Yeah. All right. Now, just, did you get a chance to see the mix early interview? Yeah. I saw about two minutes of, I don't want to see him where he has to say, oh, he's looking for apologies. I'm not interested. And then those are those were my thoughts on that. And I thought, and you probably talked about it. And I'm going to get a chance to hear you. I'm just looking for some feedback on that. There's nothing to feedback except kick his ass out. And then when he comes to Gary Bettman and says, okay, let me back in next year. If he's that stupid, the answer is no. No, goodbye. You're done forever. Good. Good. Good. But they'll be some out of taking back. No, not if the league says he can't play anymore. Last year. That's what they got to say is they got to put their foot down. That was, and see, I disagree with this criminal thing with a city of Vancouver. Because unfortunately, this is a part of the deal. You know, this is inherent violence in hockey. They permitted. But as far as the league is concerned, they did the right thing so far. Now they've got to go to the final step and make sure he doesn't come back. In the bank, Hoover, like more conservative land like the station that they're not at all. Quite quite to the contrary. Really. Wow, so he'll probably walk. They're just doing this trying to be cuter. I don't know, but I don't think that the law enforcement has any business. I mean, how about a boxer kills another boxer when a guy dies. Did they find murder charges? Happens every day. Well, there you go. You're right. Okay, pal. Have a great day. John McCain, by the way, Daniel, I didn't get on there. I mean, I've probably still on CNN suspending his campaign. John McCain. Attaboy John, as I have to handle, I helped my friend. Yeah. What is good for my country is good for my party. Should our party, unless we go there, never a party in this prison. If they're a lot of it, the American people will rightly abandon us. Just as McCain, we will show you something to the business of history. What does that mean? Deserving the damage of the spends of not being able to live in a country. He's wearing Larry King's bullets, the spenders. Why will take our crusade back to the United States Senate? Yeah. And I will keep fighting to save the government, to give the government back to the people. Yeah. To keep our promises. What do you think? What do you think? Why don't you say he's quitting his bail rate. Why don't you say that? And reforming a tax code. You're right. The benefits, the powerful fees. Then there are 17 years each, May is right, when votes of many. And with your help, my fellow Americans, we will keep trying to force open doors, where there are walls to your full participation in the great enterprises of our democracy. Do they walls of cynicism or intolerance or walls raised by self-interested elite? Of course those bombs were built in your voice. Open up the doors and those high-accountables of our government. Doors fly open, when is fly open? I want to take a final moment to speak to all those who joined our party to support our campaign. Many of whom voted in this election for the first time. Okay. Have a great life, John. There goes John McCain. He's out. Bradley and the one with the board thought it's Gordon Bush, Bush and Gordon. You like the choice? No. Who bad? That's what you got. He used to be a gangly al-gour, who has a mean handshake. Yeah, he's got that. That was great. That the bitch up there in Dormner, Carolina yesterday. That was dynamic, sensational. From the national review about how he allegedly met this black guy and took his hand so hard that he crossed the bones in his hand. He crossed his bones. Something like that. Here's Weston. Hello. Hey Neil. What is Nike going to change their ad campaign from just to do it to just give it to me? Uh-huh. If there's stock keeps going down, move down here. You know, I don't know.

Everybody else got the best my food. Come on down to tycummy on the beach. Hurried before we had to close. On the cane, in terms of the theme of campaign financial form, still kind of standing there by himself in terms of the Republican party. And most of the Democratic party. And in fact, if I can say, yeah, he said just a minute ago, he wanted to be a force for change within the Republican party. There is an argument in the Republican party going on right now. John McCain is saying, your Republicans lost the 92 at a 96 and a 98, because they were a party dominated by a conservative ideology. And that is not a winning strategy in this country. You can't win as an ideological party. You have to be a reform party. And conservatives rightly felt threatened by that. And they resisted that kind of change. Their argument is that the, what are these people saying? You know, I put this on, hoping that I could clarify because they keep what not for your on CNN, McCain suspend presidential campaign. And we just saw them up there going, but it would be better by the government so on. And you just can't get it out of these bastards. You can't squeeze it out of them. What do that mean? 560, 560, Pond 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's Pompanyo Beach, hello. Neil? Yes, sir. You're my favorite radio personality. But I have no idea what you look like. I'm listening you for 10 years. Yeah. And I've never seen your son in your father. Well, I had it way ahead of the game, believe me. When I try to get you on the internet, is it Neil in E.I.L. or E. and E.A.L. K.N. Well, I assume that you're about 6 foot 4. Yeah. But blonde here. Nice to you. Yeah, why do you want to date? Is that way you're looking good? No, I enjoy you so much. But I have no idea what you're looking like. No, I'm not. I'm not. I'm five one and I got way 622 pounds. And I have a big black mole on the front of my forehead. Or my left eye used to be. And have a great day. Okay, somebody I call that guy back. He's lonely.

And let's play God feed Harlem Globetrotters. And till our 89. Here's a mobile in Tabernier. Hello. Yes sir. Are you doing day by day? Okay. Hey, I just want to take you to my college. I've got a week ago. No, I've lost Vegas. I just got back this past weekend. Oh, I had an awesome time, Neil. It's the world's greatest place to go. Yeah. And I got back here. I asked myself, why did you come back? I must be crazy. I must be nuts. And I was. Have a good day, Neil. Okay, glad day to good times. Sir, it's still there. There's another call of verifying what we have feared. And that is one of Vegas is still there. And people are having a still out of a good time there. We were concerned about that. It's still there. 16,000 open lines here as we wait once again to see if they're going to call as the phone system work. What's it all about for Virginia? Jesus Christ, man. All man. Thanks a lot, Norma. Forget me to this joint. You lunatic you. And just like that thing said in the Herald of Smurf, who needed another goddamn Fag newspaper anyway. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a call from Lee High Acres, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, one of the throw something that you hear has a little something to do with a firm and a faction maybe. Right now is a real good time. You see we got our sets of forms coming out. Yeah. It's so mind of doing it for a while. Whenever they ask for your race, basically what I do is me. If it has a kid to me, African American, that's a nationality. Not a race. So what I do is they say, if everybody would do the same thing, check that boxmark to other. Write in Italian American or Irish American or German American. Somebody up there at the Census Bureau can look at all these papers and say, hey, what happened to all the honky? Yeah. And then what? And then everybody's in my normie and there's no need for a firm and a faction. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. My head is staring to ached tremendously. Like there's a gigantic anvil in between my ears. And it's just trying desperately to bang its way out. When it does bang it out. Here's a mobile in Bokeh, hello. Yes, Neil. I'd like to come in on that personal vote on your affirmative action call. No, I don't think you need affirmative action. You got to go ahead. When we're not taking a poll on the ears, you're the polls on the internet. We don't understand. I should clarify that more often. It may sound on our website. I apologize. I mean, what I talked about. I'm not doing the poll because polls on me are boring. Okay, I apologize. What's wrong is you don't realize that it's not just the civil servant jobs and the low end jobs that were affirmative action is actually creating a problem. It goes to try to have as the things like medical school admissions, law school admission, and the problem that occurs is you basically wanting to let again people who are not as qualified as the people that are interviewing. And what's the law is absolutely correct and is absolutely unacceptable. And I can honestly tell you I sat at a medical school interview and was interviewed by a black dean and he asked me what I thought of affirmative action at the time and did I really mind a black woman getting in ahead of me, even if we had the same grades or maybe even she had lower grades. First of all, I'm the one that's putting somebody on the spot on the interview and I told him I understood that was a completely illegal question, but even more than happy to answer it. Yeah. I told him I could tell us that someone's purple, green, white, yellow, or blue. As long as they've got the qualifications to get in, they should get in. Right. And that's what people don't realize is you basically got to dilute the pool and bring down your quality of your employee, the quality of your student, the quality of your doctor, and the quality of your bus driver, of your bus driver. It's already happened that this is the byproduct of 30 years of this insane, reverse discrimination. I just wanted to say that. Well, the whole concept here is that you can undo, you can undo one wrong by doing another one and it doesn't work. You can't legislate morality. You all can't legislate equality. It's going to happen. It's got to happen on its own. Okay. You can't legislate it. And have a great day. You too, Neil. Thank you. First, sterilization, baby. That's the answer. First, sterilization. What does Bill Bradley have explaining to you? Do you have anything to do about this? Do you have anything to do about him? We have to ask you. You got his basketball out. I guess that's all we know about him. Now is it going to say, since Spend's campaign? Why don't they just come right out and spit it out? Okay. Those are all of you people on CNN. Spit it out. Christ. Here's vocal. Hello. Volca. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil? Yes. Yes. take one minute to expose the Florida one for what it really is. It's nothing more than pandering to more or less the angry white man in America so his brother can get in. He doesn't care about black people and he doesn't really care who he's a silver spoon from Fisher Island couldn't really care less about who gets the educator who doesn't exist to get the vote for his brother. That's not what we're talking about whether we we about Jim Bush we're talking about a affirmative action whether we it is acceptable or not. Isn't this about a firm agenda that yes that's not what we're talking about so we're not talking about Jim Bush about his one Florida we're talking about affirmative action yes or no that's what we're discussing. Well and I mean obviously you are and I mean you're against it. I'm for it because I'm for other people who are less qualified and somebody else should get a job based on the color of their skin what country they give grandparents came from you think that's what we're all absolutely not but I do think that they should have a fair shot at jobs since the playing field is not level and how about how many people should they have a fair shot of jobs absolutely and how about Italian people. Hello five six seven oh five sixty how about dumb people sir how does that sound you dumb people. Eeeeeeeh five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T Rodgers Plan.

We already know what he's all about if you don't know what Jim Bush is all about I have no sympathy for you that's not the issue. Here's a mobile in Miami hello.

Our one time back was in the real outside world. Every time the TV said he says the judge, Ali on Judge recesses hearing, no decision announced. The lawsuit filed by Lazarogund, is also Saudi political asylum hearing for the boy. The judge, we're about three hours in Judge recesses hearing without reaching a decision announcing when he'll repeat reconvene in jump in a ravine. So anyway, we are pull on a de-support to form an interaction. So far we have 172 votes. Now it's starting to take up a little bit. Hop-up board, baby. Like Chris Moore used to say. Hop-up board. By the way, Stu Barnes winning gold over time last night for Buffalo. Lost in ice-cold and he was doing. He went to that in passing. All you people are ready to suck on Brian Murray's record knows, but then he rate. 272 votes. 245 said, oh wow, that's 90%. George Z. More than 100%. Only 27 said, we have a 27 said, yeah, right. Oh, we've got to be kind of quiet. 27. That's only 9.9%. Look at the board. Yeah, what just happened there again. Another word to know. What is it? They're working. Yeah, they're who's they. They the phone lines for Nate. No, but who's working on it? Who changed the phone? I don't know. I don't know. Anyone did. Who performed some miracle on it? No one said that anyone did. Yeah. Okay. Maybe he was just a miracle from from. Yeah. Could have been. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Going once. Going twice. That kind of rubber raft. Okay. Let's try Miami and six. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I think there needs to be a different kind of affirmative action. Especially Miami-Dade County. Yeah. I think if you don't have a certain amount of a certain rate that you should have the higher. I mean, we're going to do it. If we're going to do it for the blacks. I mean, we might as well do it for everybody because it's. They're already doing affirmative action isn't just for blacks. It's for Hispanics and women in all minorities. Well, yeah. Well, I'm uncomfortable. I'm a white male. And you know, I want you to. Aren't you Hispanic? No. You're not? No. You're a you're a honky. Well, you know, you know, Italian. You know, you're Italian. Well, Italian. Italian. Italian. Let me tell you, you know, I won't. Yeah. Italian. The Italian. Uh-huh. Somewhere back there. I haven't. Somewhere in the way in the back. Right. Okay. Well, how much you got a little Italian in. Is that what you trying to say, sir? Well, maybe a big Italian. Or maybe you had like a chef who already wants your twice. That's the point. But, you know, I go into place. I just went to a tag agency down here in South West Miami. Right. You know, there are five foot. A few more. A few more. You know, I don't know. Sure. Now, my women. Why do you keep shouting in there under your breath of this guy's black? How do you know that? You can hear him. I hear him sound black to me. Something like he might be black or might have a little black at him. A little tiny in him. Maybe he's got the Italian side in him. And what's the points, sir? George. George insisted that you're black. Are you black? Well, that's because he's cute. Are you a darkie? No, I'm a horse. No, not a darkie. So why why does George keep saying you're black? I don't know. He's sitting there spitting blood in there. Send this to the guy. Didn't cool on the phone. No. Is this the he cool? No, no cool. Oh, that's right. He's dead. He cool. But I'll try this much. I'm sick of it down here. Yeah. I'm sick of it down here. And I can't take this anymore. No, okay. Well, let's see. Good luck to you. Howard Beale. He's a matter of health. But no, wait a minute. Don't tell me this thing happened again, here. Oh, boy. You see, and you thought what a fool of you are. You're so easy. It works for like five seconds. There. Now, here we are back on this again. This is the first time I've seen this crap. This piece of turd. This should have had phones system or it. Because we worked for incompetent broadcasters for refused to give us the equipment that we need. The only, I know it's getting pondered. It's my saying that 40 million times. But I do need to emphasize that that these people refuse to do what it takes. And the fact that we got some stuff sitting on the floor here now, that may or may not solve the problem we don't know, that that proves nothing to me. Because this is taken. I'm like an active god. This is taken incessant stress and threats of lawsuits. And the lawyer is back in the fourth just to get to this point too. You can hear that sound. Hello. Yes, man. Right. Okay. Can you hear me okay? Yeah, you hear me good. No. I didn't. That just happened spontaneously. She just vanished by itself. Just like line eight comes out by itself. Line four. Drops out by itself. Because we got people dicken with our phone. I want everybody in this town. I want everybody in America to know that here at WCWA on Lea Rogers. Here we have people dicken with our phone. There is no doubt about that. You just saw that right there again. They're dicken with it and the phone too. And our people are sitting around. Go and. Oh, don't say nothing bad about the stock. It's going to cost us all money. That's going to cost you guys money. Because you're the one to get all the stock. The family. If you're part of expression. WCWA. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. All right. Hey. I'm one of these African American guys. You're a cone. All right. Yeah. Well, basically. Uh, what I see it is that I'm one of the ones that I think a firm in a Vaction really isn't needed. Right. But until we have a mentality throughout the nation, we're all considered as equal people when we are all on a level. That's what happened. I mean, you know, okay. Well, I'm sure we're going to forget about Black and White. What about what I should be for about ugly people. Now, ugly people will never be considered as an equal as beautiful people. You know that. It may be beautiful on the inside. But nobody cares about that. You know that. Nobody worries about that. Huh? They need to be slipped inside out. Okay. And while we're working on that. Okay. Well, basically, Neil is right this way. I see it is that what we have here is not a black and white thing. Not a male female thing. Yeah. When you have one third of the working population that being white males controlling 97% of all management and he go corporations. Right. That's not a level playing field. Do not go to get a level playing field. That's right. How about basically, well, I want to help you to find black listeners out there. About the 88. How come there's not more white guys in the NBA? Huh? I should go ahead. Oh, okay. Well, I think that you was people for making back the ball. Yeah. Okay. Basically, when we have 1% of the population making more money than the entire 95% of the working club in the NBA. But the guys in the NBA just need 2,300 of them. I'm making more and all those other white guys you're talking about are some maybe for Bill Gates. Hey. They make nothing compared to what the one the top one percent of this country makes. Really? Yes. There's guys in the NBA making 17 and 20 million dollars a year. What's that Bill Gates? He makes what? Oh, how many how many Bill Gates are they hanging around these days? You know any? I don't know any guys like Bill Gates. Not too many. No. Not too many. But there's a, what a 63 millionaires being created every month in America. And in some of our black. So what's the problem? What I'm saying is that if we're going, this is what we want. There is not going to be an even playing field. Sure. The fact is that this is that life isn't fair. You have to go out and do the best of your ability and get an education and compete and do the best you can. Okay. And you can't take away somebody else's job who's better qualified than you based on something that allegedly happened two to three hundred years ago. No, and the people wanted, they're not going to step at anymore. It's not going to happen. Okay. Okay. I can't go over. You don't, we don't need to get, we don't need to be given any jobs because of our skin color. Right. Just giving 40 acres with the meal plus interest. Okay. You know, hey, basically we got a, we got a surplus and money. I, hey, I'll get out there and work. I work. I work two three jobs. Yeah. I go to school. Take care of my fund. You know, I'm one of the quote unquote a law-biting black citizen. But you're there. That's good. Yeah. I'm a good Negro. Oh boy, that's good. We like you boys being good in obedience. Yes, sir. We look now. We'll not see white people. We're on keeping my place. Yep. Basically, you look like a little bit. Get on one knee. Go pick some cotton and have a great weekend. Yes, sir. There's a good old boy. He may know in his place. Right? Yeah. That's the way we like it now. We're talking some sense. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Does this thing with the phone? I'm going to tell you something. It is so effing unacceptable. It's just, it's mind boggling it is. So it's just a basic rudiment to sit in here and do it a job. And this man comes in here. They're going to stand there and look at me and go, Eeeeh. Just like that. Just like that. And I look at him and I'm thinking of myself. I work for this. I would say this is the van of signs by check, but he don't sign anybody's check. Did I let him sign a check? No. No. He makes the little squiggle on it. In fact, he must be using our T-room down the hall. There are two ones in the walker. That's what I think will squiggle on the wall. He's doing graffiti not to. Maybe he's practicing. 24, 2, 5, 60, W, Q, A. Gordon gives staff Florida a major blow job. A ride. And now on the campaign trail with George W Bush. Today, America's candidate addresses the unionized workers at South Carolina's Turbine Town Factory. Right to be here in Nevada. Saved Carolina, Nevada. I want to be your president because I can relate to the ignorant blue collar worker. Don't say that. Did you think you're a worker all over the world? Hey, boys, shortening all my work. I've never had work today in my entire life. And smooth, silky, palm-a-l, you're soaking in it. Let's go to the next question. Yo, my, yes, sir. Yeah, where are you going to go now, water? Good question being fortunate, subs in the tip. Marijuana legalization. No, absolutely not cocaine. Yes. Thinks in pain, heroin probably. I bet you it's in pedemines with addedap. We'll add a dash. Now you. What are you going to do with the black man? Thanks for asking. First thing I'd like to do. See me one up close. Not too close. No touching. Perhaps maybe get a lot. What? Can I get a lot? Sure. Don't be so thank you very much. We got to go. I got to go. I'm just a fan of trail. With George W. Boyle. 1.46. Wait here to hear this one. And I wish I had a better copy of this. But thanks anyway. Lisa, there's a fax is pretty weak. But I'll work my way through. It says it's hard to imagine the music of off-mallion, Gosshock, or Marilyn Manson, and popping boasts the basketballs having much in common. But apparently both act all fall in the category, unfit for young years, at least in San Antonio. Forest students from the private sunny book, Christian Academy, have been suspended from school for attending a back street voice concert last week at the Alamo dome. The students were busted for breaking a school rule, barring involvement with inappropriate music, school administrator, Tudy Perez told the AP. The back street voice have some good music, she said, but some of the music I've been told has certain sexual references for resident I've been told she says, certain sexual references, that's not the message we want to convey to our young people. We want the message of sexual abstinence. So students that this good Christian school suspended for go to a back street voice concert. How do you like that? God, give me a break. And if they want abstinence, then they should probably go to a Jessica Simpson and Nick, what's his name concert? What's his name? Lacky. I did not say, Lacky. I said Lacky. Yeah, what all the heavy breathing that he's doing in there? I mean, he sings great, but boy, he's your breath heavy a lot. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. I sure know that. Believe me. Here's a cross-praying. Hello. Yes sir. I just got two things to say. Okay. First off about WDW, WDW right with definitely unrocking, but one call. Yeah there you go. George Loses. Of course. Anybody knows that? Of course. Everything is. You know, we're getting what a front of action all day, you know, about from every, on my normie. But I wonder what about us bags? I mean, we don't get any special treatment. I mean, we can't, we can't, we can't even marry. I don't know. I gotta say, lift yourself up by the boots, Raff. So, of course, in our case, we don't have to because what you can slow already, you've got an advantage. Exactly. We've got a head start, so to speak. Exactly. And just one more thing about that. A Christian school in San Antonio, did you say? Yes sir. And they could all kiss my rectum for all I care. I mean, that's the most blow to bull crap I've ever heard. Okay. I'm just standing up, but the hell is that? And say hi to Nicky. Oh, definitely. Okay. Bye. Can I ask my motto, Nicklacky or Nick Carter? That's our poll question at the moment. A lot of that. A lot of that. And one thing, Nicklacky, sure, breeds hard to help a lot. So she's into Athens. Maybe they just do heavy breeding together those two. They just breed a lot. On each other. Do things she's ever seen it? No. That's it? No. Well, what does that mean? She's into Athens. That Jessica Simpson bitch. Every time I see her, that's where I think of myself. I think two things. What a waste in that bitch. Here's my any. Hello. My any. Okay. We don't have time to dittle around with these people. Okay. Here's a mobile in my any. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. I'm sorry. I went to a, I went to a predominantly black school for high school in Holland. And I mean, the people there, there's people there. There's people that sit there and concentrate on football and got up and hanging out on the street on Friday night. Yeah. Smoking their 40s. There's people there. You know, I mean, obviously, I'm not racist. I've been obviously, dominant black schools. Some of my best friends are black and they want to universities now. I will see. You see, and you know, there are decent kids and they don't speak with Iby doing this. Right. Right. And you know, and the most respect to people in the country don't speak that way. Of course not. And let me tell you, I mean, these people that are complaining that they don't have anything. You know, let them go speak to somebody that does and see how they did in school and see if they worked on their class work. I mean, these kids go to school. They don't do anything and they want everything to be handed to. And my other point is, you go back to, you know, like the depression of the country, you know, the Roosevelt put in all these programs to help, you know, both to the economy to help bring it up. But eventually, you have to get rid of them. And, you know, I mean, I searched. You got rid of them and the economy fell again. But eventually, you got rid of them and, you know, I mean, we had to stand up and everybody survived. Everybody's going to stand up on their own thing. I see them. You've got to. And just keep putting them on the crutch. Eventually, you just got to, you know, you just got to let it go. And these people that, you know, the ones that really want to survive and that want to move up in the world that are black, they're going to make it. They just got to do it. They got to give you the plan. That's the thing. Okay, pal. Just like what's his name says, you know, if you want to, if you don't speak right, you're all going to be real light. Nobody says that that guy out there. You know, that Johnny cockering that guy. There's another classic example for you. Now he's got 14 TV shows and playing a race car. They're doing a bad, bad, bad power. So look, see, this is all crap that we're going through right now. All crap. And we have a whole segment of this population that thinks that was wonderful that OJ since we got away with killing those two honkeys. It was great because now pay back as a bitch. I mean, what kind of twisted warped sick this disgusting hateful mentality is that? Except for the worst, the worst, ultra right wing, Ku Klux clan, hood wearing asshole. What kind of person wasn't grossed out by the lynching of that poor black guy in Texas that was dragged behind a pickup truck? I would say 99 and 910% of people in this country would agree that was one of the most disgusting things they've ever seen or heard of. And I think that's why the real ultra, ultra-biguted disgusting racist pigs would have been a hand slap on a crap. And yet with OJ, well, see, we got a whole bunch of people got to make up for crap. No more making up, okay? Everybody get a brain and cut the bull crap. Instead of like somebody owes you this and I owe this, I don't know if it ain't nothing. Invite a waste, Dan. Where's my two grand? Shmuck. 152 at 5.50 WQM. The cane can't be worse than fourth in the big East. Do you agree with that? You see, right, I can be the Smithman. No, that's not my question. Right now, the standing. I can see the fifth. Hitch F. You ever shut up and listen? Oh, that's sports radio 560. Q8M. I don't believe it. Yes, it's just about who we are. You can take your cross-date. It's a lot of buzz-backed games. This is natural way. Oh, right. How it's all that I don't know. What's all the two principles? The police. A gun for like a monster. Who? This is the powerway. This is... This is... Yes, for both of us, it's great. This is... This is... This is... This is the powerway. Forward. Right, right. Right, you. Right out. Watch the movie. Move the two feet. Move the two feet. Move the ground. There's a highway. This is the latest thing. But get the hill to back over. Ooh, back. He's here for right to feed. This is the highway. This is the people we tonight. Ooh, no, today. He's a spy. Do the wife and his head reside. This is the highway. Right out there. This is... This is... If, for both of you, we're a cage. Yeah, this is... This is... Yeah, this is the highway. And we're in the wild. Please forward. Good one. Bye.
