I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! I'm a Bop Nala! My baby Maldana! My baby Maldana! I'm a Bop Nala! My baby Maldana! Your baby Maldana! Take a boost, street my ass. Does this tell you what's wrong with the world today? And now those poor Canadians manos, poor bastards, they're lost their gold medal because this gabriati guy, this goofball, tested positive for pot. Now pot stays in your system for like a month, three to four weeks. Okay, now I think the whole thing is ridiculous at best because certainly marriage of winning is not a performance enhancing drug by any stretch of the imagination. No way Jose unless you're unless the contest is an eating contest then you got an edge or a watching TV content. Right, but other than that, I mean if anything it would be a performance dulling. So you know maybe three four weeks this guy is so stupid that he smoked some lead back in Canada which of course is very common place to say the worst. Family common place like out on young street and church street all over Toronto, and I'm sure in Vancouver or even in Moostra, wherever this guy is from. He's probably from Whistler BC or someplace like that. Oh yeah. He is from Kitchener and the medicine hat and Whistler A. What a silly bunch of people. I mean love a Toronto but what a silly bunch of people. And then they write so he's so stupid, you know these guys practice their whole lives to do the silly crap and go over there because it's such an honor and such a big deal and the smoke and dope like three or four weeks before they go over there. So on the one hand naturally it's stupid and just like now there's an article in the Sun Center which hasn't learned about that yet I guess because there's sleeping but pot testing gained support for the NVA and some of the NVA biggest star as favor-mandered to retesting players from marijuana breaking ranks for the players union. And it goes on about Chris Weber and I say a writer in this one and that one in the peekaboo street and it's set of and so on. Jose says that the guy says that he got it from second hand smoke at his going away party. Second hand smoke. Yeah like sounds like Bill Clinton now we're kind of like a second hand blow job. That's going to be the newest use after a day after the grand jury testimony was second hand job. Oh sorry can't say that. How you're a deal was more than a second hand job. Well at any rate I wanted it. Hey you done it for Kipriotti here and when I'm a fliffin ball from the court I'm getting a job. Don't up my hand and I get my best hit off a Jennifer Kipriotti cut his ball can bomb. That's right it's the Jennifer Kipriotti tennis ball can bomb. Cops will never suspect his innocent looking dad just empty the ball screw on the ball filling the water and your Zep to destroy brain cells the Jennifer Kipriotti way. Uh this is so smooth. It's the bomb that thinks that the tennis ball can. That tennis ball can. That things with the bomb. Proceeds benefit the Jennifer Kipriotti mingles the bed's but normal approved. Okay so that big goofy David Robinson all star center of the San Antonio Express says we should be tested we should all be tested it's an old brainer meaning merge a wini and I said you David Robinson you were an asshole okay and a goodie too she was an affony. Why is it anybody's business unless it affects somebody's performance why is it anybody's business in any profession all is mandatory drug testing all these different jobs now it's nothing more than a goddamn witch hunt and it's nobody's business if you're smoking weed where I'll let's you're legal so are a lot of positions in sex too okay but that doesn't mean that is anybody's goddamn business. Oh it's picking up positions in sex I'm at mommy's house I'm going to have to start taking notes every week she comes up with another classic now she decided that probably the president must be gay and I said why would you say that with all these women that he's doing I'll but he likes our all sex forget notes you need to rotate oh my god talk about out of touch with reality talk about from a very distant generation of the long long past and I try to explain to her ma all men like oral sex. and of course she just went on to her next topic well that explains why you're dad so certainly. You really want to give me started don't you even Monica Lewinsky wouldn't do that okay for a lover money trust me when I tell you the thought is so grotesque the thought of that is so puked inducing that I can't even begin to tell you oh my god so no wonder Ma's got an diversion to her I think he did make a good point but in reverse but at the president's a fact it okay because he likes her all sex so that goes back to the survey we took last week which most of you lied about by the way but there you are. Ma thinks the president's a fact because he likes oral is moral but in any way getting back to this week business it's nobody's god damn business and I listen to that's your performance at the orifice on the plane field of it some stupid goddamn sport in the snowboard whatever the hell this guy is riding over there this poor Canadian bastard this uh capricotting gabriati whatever this guy's name is he ain't no peekable street I'll tell you that they got split and they got a curler a woman curler from Canada her name is Sandish Merler said I swear to god we laughed so hard last night I thought I was gonna pee in my pants what I heard on this emisi they were talking about Sandish Merler the woman curler and she's from Whistler be seen or something I'd say I play oh my god oh and you people are taking this seriously any of you oh man Sandish Merler the lady curler from Whistler BC but she ain't got nothing on peekable street I'll tell you that who is almost as good as I I'd be hip or whatever that the cool name was that basketball player from Maryland or Virginia whoever the hell he played for nobody cares about whether Jax or anybody else is smoking weed because all this audience is and they're sick and tired of being drug tested like this is some kind of a like a police state oh it is sorry I'm telling you that for years it's a goddamn police state they're gonna give you a drug test because you're gonna work in Walgreens or something they're gonna give you a drug test to be sitting behind a desk somewhere because you're the executive vice president of a bank uh that's got like 75 customers in the Poccipsy New York they're gonna give you a drug test based on what that's like the frickin word police we got up there at the FCC that the congress gets together Jesse Holmes and all these other Nazis and they get together with these old poodleish farts and they just make up a list what you can't say this yeah based on what what we said so oh that's great that sounds like the American way to me that sounds exactly like what the founding fathers had in mind founding fathers who the hell were they and what uh how about their score in the Olympic they grew hemp the founding fathers yeah there were smoking the rope is what they were doing and they were also doing the slaves the slave women but we don't want to talk about that because that's uh that'd be bad let's go second hand we've heard of the it dangers of second hand cigarette smoke now we got the dangers of second hand marriage we need smoke but to get you to qualify and lose your metal baby and they'll stick your ass out there on peak of loose street here's a mobile and four lotterdale hello hey no hey done okay sir first the I think actually did play from Maryland I think so but who cares yeah we're about the drug testing thing yeah what are you draw what do you draw the line you say it's okay that they smoke marijuana and uh they're trying to draw the line marijuana is not a it doesn't affect somebody's performance it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't enhance their performance and people are like I just said a minute ago I'm going to go around stealing money and robbing banks and uh seven eleven's and gas stations to get money to support a marijuana habit it's ridiculous so that's that's your reason for not testing it because of why it did they go what is your reason that you should test for marijuana well I'm not saying that they really should understand it I don't think if they're going to test for one they should test for all I don't think they should draw one of them how about if they test for nicotine to see if you're smoking cigarettes the cigarettes are illegal well what difference doesn't make whether it's legal or illegal like I said before in the state of Florida any sex other than missionary position man and woman is illegal okay so it should be arrest everybody we're so really going to people's bedrooms and find out if anybody's doing it in the wrong position no I don't I don't agree with you so yeah what difference does it make if we have a lot of our cash stupid laws whose businesses it if it doesn't affect anything or change anything what difference does it make well then it looks like the problem is actually with the law not that they're testing for marijuana I mean I I agree I think that they should I I think that they should test for marijuana there and I think that they should test for marijuana in the in the NBA based on what they found out because I think that the jobs get away with as much crap as they possibly they get away with too much so in other words it's only only only only only juxtmook marijuana is that we are saying sir no but that's what we're talking about here is we're the testing is done you brought up that they're testing in the NBA they're they test in all look if you know it's well as I do that if you go to apply for a job in a lot of companies in this country not just sports in any kind of endeavor government job you're going to they have random drug testing you know that I hope if I do and based on what what is it their business if you're smoking pot I don't maybe they're afraid of uh your job performance maybe I'm not really sure I can't really I can't really tell you why they do it I'm just saying that if they're going to test for what how is that going to affect your job performance well what you mean you smoke marijuana the night before yeah exactly listen I'm not giving you an answer for why they do it I said no but but we're having a discussion I'm not asking you to justify but what how is the smoking weed going to affect your job performance I'm not saying it will I don't feel that much what's so what's the point well like I said I think is because they're going to test for one they're going to test for all I don't think that if you say okay well hey it's okay if you're going to smoke marijuana we're going to test you out for cocaine so I know the difference between hard drugs and marijuana you don't see okay get a new phone so you're calling me back I'd be delighted to what debated with you but your phone blows this guy doesn't see a difference between cocaine which is a highly addictive substance which affects people's personality and behavior and in many cases causes them to become dangerous that is correct trust me when I tell you I have known people who become totally change personality change are not trustworthy those people most of you don't want working for you if they're really addicted to cocaine if they have a serious crack problem or another kind of a a no portion of this drug just maybe reproduce without being stressed written permission of WQAMB's release acquisition court good bye Chris Farley you great big fatty always acting like a great big fat stuff retard and every field you'll never say to that for David's babe his career could take us only has left is that label TV show he won't be making money movies no more as you want it to be just like chocolate sushi and have drawn a lot these truth you finally made it but we're not too careful what you wish you gave us lots of laughter on Saturday night but you were way too young to die think of this bad man to a side good bye Chris Farley what did you eat too blow up like a big blue reading like a fool that with only bringing certain days the farmers are a test and all you left one some table booze these and a few days of your time that will still to make a new to people and you want to be just like chocolate sushi and have drawn happy to you finally made it but we're not too careful what you wish your test is to hold a piano that's it you reach the pizza in the sky you got so fat you don't you? Chris Farley the night they had some brought on their one of the one of the tabloid shows last night the night before he croaked home let's see how much heroin I've had heroin and coke and fish food and whatever else he was doing all together and vodka on top of it just to make sure to wash it down you got to wash it down with some good vodka that's right that's what Boris said bad enough it wasn't bad enough that he was doing a heroin but he was doing coke too so he's dead Chris Farley there you go but I mean this this guy comparing I mean oh yeah they're getting away with enough is it it who cares about that why don't we get all upset if they're beaten up their wife or their girl for why don't we get upset about that how come nobody give a crap at the Jimmy Johnson sign of Lauren Phillips who's not about a goddamn gangster how come nobody care about that but we're concerned if he passes a drug test or not that really concerns me whether he's smoking marijuana not whether he's going to be beaten women up all over the place what kind of mentality we be talking about in this country man we're talking about people they just they can't sit down and look at this thing rationally because most of them are emotional cripples emotional cripples and this crap about the NBA is going to do pot testing David Robinson says oh yeah we should all subject to what it's a no brainer the NBA is a no brainer okay it's for a bunch of illiterate freaks is what it is David Robinson you asshole here's Miami hello in ill yes sir are you doing okay we don't hit the well heads here I'm listening okay well anyway on the second hand smoke of the marijuana I have a friend who basically could not smoke because of the government watching over him yeah and he enjoys burning every couple of times so when he went to get a mandatory you know pissed us and he came back positive he told the his his probation officer he's like oh no I was in a room with a bunch of people smoking yeah and the probation officer gave him a bunch of like evidence I got agreed bit for bulk of Ryan by the way to the tuna second hand rose second hand smoke but anyway anyway he says that the probation officer given a bunch of evidence about how much second hand smoke you had to be in exposed to for you to come back positive for even a minister of not you'd have to be in a room that was called the couple of hours you know constantly breathing it yeah and I mean if you smoke pot in the bath at any point if you like to smoke that stuff and you're in a room and they've been smoking for two hours you didn't tell me you're not going to take a hit or whatever and I mean snowboard also let's let me ask you so that it goes in well no way to all I want to hear this about snowboarding what's here this oh I need snowboarding and the Olympics who is not going to think of these snowboarders are not potatics any of these guys are a bunch of potatics oh yeah I mean they are the biggest burnout all the surfers I knew in high school yeah surfers in snowboarders there you go Bob I love your logic man this is great I mean it's cute follow the bouncing dots here we go from A to Z to T to uh to F U okay great great job pal excellent that could have been the greatest call in history oh man those pothos chronic pot heads man those snowboarders I wonder about Sandwich Merler the curler I wonder what she's doing he's probably got her hair up in curler's that bitch oh and Sweden by the way I want to curler women's curling my two against Canada oh my god the Canadian like 95% of all curlers in the world are Canadians and they already lost one match between that and maybe losing this gold medal they may never come out of hiding they may like start doing like the Eskimo's and build igloo's and go inside and never come out come out who here's a mobile lady in Hollywood hello hello Neil yes ma'am good morning I've this is the first time I'm calling you however I would see you for years and I do admire many of the things that you say but however I take issue a little bit this morning with the pot testing with regard to your employment there are some situations where it is very dangerous to smoke pot particularly if you like to drink beer lunch or even have a drink at lunch and you mix it with the pot there are things you can do that you normally wouldn't do like what well for example I know a personal experience because I happen to be an insurance agent and we have a very serious situation that occurred in one of our insured business operation with a man did that just that lunch time came back and an a job that he had been working on for 10 years stuck his hand in the mixing that and cut it off all right excellent well I'll just eat him I guess you won't be doing that again no I guess he won't so what's the problem well the problem here is that drug testing on the job is in many cases very important and so if you smoke pot you shouldn't be doing it while you're working I mean maybe if you're working in a job but wait a minute you said you shouldn't be doing it if you why you're working but if it stays in your system for like up to a month then how do you know what when you're doing it so far you smoke it recreationally on a weekend at home not when you're on a job well I I don't know very much about how long it's been here since the minute I just got to a telling you up to a month well you're testing after lunch yeah it's right how about boost testing at the lunch let me tell you something and those kind of stuff I will be a breathalizer test after lunch well I don't I mean where do we stop this insanity is what I say actually I really do believe that we have become insane with testing except that in the case of drugs it is a very important thing in some situation I'm not saying that we should be testing everybody for everything because we're losing totally our rights in this country we don't have any rights in this country we have a right to be oppressed by a fascist police state is what we have you don't have any rights now this is how the free country to joke hey listen we still have the right to talk to you about these things which makes it a right yeah unfortunately we're limited as to what we can say there be you still got to watch your language or the word police are going to come down and don't take your way that's something else again I don't agree with that either I think if you want to say how things you can say them and that shouldn't be oppressed by anybody and whether it's on the radio or TV or wherever but the point is that there there I don't know whether you agree to this completely maybe impartially you're a tree that there are certain situations where drug testing whether it be marijuana or heroin or whatever is an important factor I would say if you're working in a candy store then they definitely should be able to drug testing you want some of your in a kind of a restaurant they don't want you to not profit right don't a chop that would be good one have a great day sweetheart we have an open line in date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty because God forbid if you smoked weed like two weekends ago and you had a beer for lunch today we know that you are a danger to society God forbid pizza chef or delivery boys definitely tell you that's right chinese food delivery all I don't tell you he would never need to need after smoke weed how do you like that and he still had the munchies he was a hungry boy he was just a big chubby hungry guy that's all and he ate all forty dollars worth of chinese food on the way back to the house can you imagine if they tested radio management for alcohol after lunch oh yeah okay one up there right now oh my god how about brain testing for management that sounds good to me of course where there's no sense there's no feeling here's north Miami hello yes sir yeah you're doing the ill great uh I have a question yes have two questions and then I I want to show them about the fire uh how come you can't get ice cream like Italy here because I had a lot of pistach I don't need a lot of ice cream but man I used to eat ice cream every day in Italy the stash ice cream in it's a lot those sir gelato is not ice cream it's gelato it's made that doesn't have all that cream and it's not all that the chalk and artificial crap it's made from all natural stuff and they don't make it here there you know once in a while a place will come along and try to make good gelato and even if it is good the public's taste is so bad because the busy eating wires and seals and eaties that those places do go out of business man I used to I mean I mean I don't I don't I'm in an ice cream but I was eating it every day twice a day yeah every little shop had it well when I go to Italy I eat it a lot and the ice cream too hey I have a question for George he says you have this commercial called feats field extreme watches with his voice on it yes oh I thought yeah he apologizes profusely for it too and about let me ask your question and this guy would have been from Amsterdam where it's legal to smoke pot what were they gonna say to the guy well you know it's interesting because American that now that is a good point marijuana they would just say an unseen in that marijuana is not among the substances listed at the Olympics is being illegal but that it reverts back to the country and the laws there so if it were one of the Dutch players in like a soccer player of course enough playing those soccer in the winter Olympics but whatever the Dutch competitors are ice skater that it would not be a problem how do you like that and Canada says that's blatantly unfair in a budget crap and they're a quiet foul day I don't think that's very fair how do you like that how do you like them green apples huh those green apple I don't know why say that this guy this gratsiano or Greg Gabriella I say you should move to how Amsterdam would be a good idea hey there you go at least you'd have a good time and as far as I drug testing in the workplace so they can figure out it until they can't drug test you the moment you know how much you've had at that particular moment I think they should just band it all together because there's no way that you're gonna tell me what I have to do in my house in my car or what I do at any time that I'm not at work because I only work for them for eight hours not the rest of my day so that's the bottom line we're gonna be doing fish food testing hey there you go yeah why don't we just survey let's see our eight year fact I want you to visit see how much food you've been eating right exactly I mean what do you draw the line you know I mean let me get a cute to protect this woman now maybe she's been giving me more sex or somebody in the parking lot oh well now you're talking okay have a great day pal okay sounds like a job he wants I'm about 15 years old your listening to the best of meal Rogers on five six weeks you a abs so anyway let's do a mobile and west Palm Beach hello Neil can't disagree with you more about the pot smoking okay I'm a max pot addict from the age of 15 to 25 yeah I'm telling you I was more victim than cold than any of them we had to start by victim than fish food too I bet correct George he's been in his pants in the room better take a sample by the way before we got 38 now I stopped 13 years ago but before we played baseball we smoked before went to the movies as small because yeah we had sex we smoked before anything we need a pot we couldn't do it without pot yeah a lot of my friends are still let me ask you this is as much as I found upon people who are like obsessed with pot because there are people who are juvenile and sit around sitting and picking seeds all day and they think that's a life but nevertheless we how do they know the way why do they know how to read this green stuff to had no seeds and I mean how do you affect your life it affected it tremendously because it opened the door to and you're gonna think this is job it opened the door to coke it opened the door and I'm getting it yeah yeah what's you violate your body so I guess what I never have a beer because next thing you're gonna be I don't I never like beer but I'm telling you you're affected me in the workplace it affected me driving a lot of I know but but they argue it's that you know it's the same argument as you better never have a beer because then you're gonna become an alcoholic and you're gonna start to it can you know it's it has stick and vodka bottles in your pocket I mean there are there are always gonna people and be people no matter what you're talking about they're the outgills things of the world are gonna go out and need until they get to be 500 pounds does that mean we should outlaw any foods they're fed in no no but I you know why it life changed that has to give them my own now and um they're 14 and 11 and they're getting to that age where or I remember when I let's see better stuff yeah yeah no no I stop the long time ago but the bottom saying now I'm overprotective I'm a hypervisor bring in their song my parents are like Georgia there were refugees from Cuba that came down here yeah well no humans don't smoke we know that they didn't run you better they were working 14 hours a day I was alone at home and all my friends did and we did and I'm telling you that they don't smoke they didn't know anybody but I couldn't disagree with you more I was testing for it and I hope they keep it out of everything because it's not my only you know something I know that when I go over a Holland man every time I've only been an Amsterdam about 30 times I'm gonna go over there it's a miracle that that country can function you know I'm well need let me tell you something well we're on it we're less aggressive let me ask you have you ever ever been to Amsterdam never been to have you know I'll get on a plane to go there you might learn something there's a pot addict for you there boys and girls there's a good lesson for everybody he's obsessed so like the fish food addict I say we go to public right now may enforce them to take it what other freezer container because we have fish food addicts already and those people are going to kill themselves on that crackles they're out of control and let's close down every bar because we got alcoholics let's bring back prohibition maybe let's put in everything then we got sex addicts just watch what's it then Jerry Spigger he'll do a 20 shows on at this week sex addicts people who can't get enough they're doing it the NBA they want to do drug testing we got a guy a Canadian a jack if a snowboarder can wear a jack strap whatever it hell he was this guy may lose his gold metal because he may have actually inhaled a little bit or may have actually smoked a little bit or may have actually walked to a room somewhere where somebody may have smoked it or not as the case maybe and they found like a little trace in his uh... scored court yeah and they're having a nervous breakdown now because they know suit of that well what else can we test for in your system definitely have fish food testing because we know that your blood sugar go away up and you become irresponsible and got only knows you're going to be not fit for driving i wouldn't be surprised that they stop your street corners now stop lights and they do honest spot checks blood sugar test you know they give you that little pin prick if i can say that and uh... yeah look at my fingertips man look at all those pinfrikes that's right when you die of headache you have a lot of pinfrikes on the tips of your fingers but at any rate the other than the start and do that spot checks on street corners now and if your blood sugar is like over two fifty but yeah i state the jail you're a menace to decide you're going to kill somebody out there airline pilot before you get on that plane make sure he didn't have no fish food before he took off here's the four waterdale hello hello sir uh... for some color i guess i'd be in the cute color since uh... i'm a chronic okay uh... anyway i can show itself a well-trained high-precision cynic you like agree with a lot of things that you talk about but and you know states of course uh... what right we all have really is the right to be as irresponsible as you want to be until you know you reach a certain limit and we have these freedoms and people sort of the abuse of until it starts costing somebody some money somewhere and they gotta go and do something about taking that freedom away but uh... well what does that mean when his marijuana ever been decriminalized in america uh... well i mean it has a but but the reason for that from a tried prohibition with blue's next year work real well the man no and and it's a part of the can't a real well we can't expect our people to be responsible with the freedoms that they have like we have a small business and uh... we've got you know it's we do contracting and that sort of thing and you got guys they're not exactly the you know top models society but uh... they go out and they're doing physical labor for you and uh... they're they're climbing roof tops and things like that and we've had cases in the past where people were on the people and substances and the uh... accident and then the customer for the reliable for that can understand and you're talking about us personal right and then not only that but the employees who's you too uh... even though she was the one who is irresponsible on the job so yeah so what do you do about that well in that case that's an exception i wouldn't have any problem of it uh... i can see in the mba were if the guy's done you're talking to enter somebody out of the court if anything you'll take fewer shots and you probably wouldn't beat up the coach uh... good point but uh... the thing is we have something that we do it works here not that it works but it's an attempt anyway that's called a drug free workplace and you start off your relationship with the business under the assumption that you know you're not gonna this isn't going to be something you're doing on the job so we're allowed to drug test before you start the job and that's sort of thing and what's sad about this is amazing how many people who call up looking for job and say oh but by the way this is a drug free workplace how many people show up still up the forms and then just never appear again well but isn't that their choice you just got to you know but you know but the thing is it is a business is going to be responsible for what it's employees do then we have to know we have to feel safe and secure that they're not going to be out right now i would agree with that i think that you got a uh... you know you have a right because you're liable and uh... you have a right to make sure that they're not doing whatever might be in pair of their senses etc but so you know three but that's a very rare exception somebody's doing an office job at a desk unless of course they're making decisions decisions that uh... you know are like uh... national security risking something like that or i can understand that studio uh... or for radio equipment or something like that right exactly and i think i think i might help that some drugs for these factors over here but the thing is you you know once again as a society if the people aren't going to be responsible enough to be able to decide when or they are going to use the substances you can't expect but you know you know something can expect a new one but you know it's a question let me say something new and that is that as long as things are forbidden when you go to europe there is no drinking age in any country that i know of in europe and yet is idly especially public drunkenness is found upon the certain extent that i mean they would they would come and beat the crap out of you if they found you staggering around drunkenness street it would take you uh... under cover somewhere and give you a lecture and so bring up and tell you better not to do it again uh... and you don't you don't have any problem of young people staggering around drunk or telling each other because the drinking and driving you don't have that another french habit because they got a bunch of drunks over there to begin with but i'm talking about countries with a generally socially responsible in the first place like italy and like uh... Holland and those you don't have that problem but you know making a game with a small family and the whole of the rates you know in the world and that's a name in rush i have very high up on the rates and they also have what is that happening with idly uh... it doesn't but you know it's it doesn't have to go to Holland which is the freeest country in the world was that i have to do it and the cost of the group that kind of freedom and you are a lot of the you are a little bit of a senior and so is the only you make things for bitton the more people want them that's my point okay before i i leave or you but i want to give you something that i hope you can use this as a cart but i want to do a celebrity in personation for you yeah why don't you go i'll go okay yeah i wasn't bad you're

never been documented to get cancer like you know cigar and i'm not complaining about the guard and i think you're blood sugar raising up like sugar does either by the right i guarantee right now sugar is a lot more dangerous than marijuana ever can be and i don't think they didn't sugar testing on his uh... and she member of gabriotic i did this no board of the one-of-a-gold metal there are no absolutely it's not your answer he was doing uh... fish food before he did the thing absolutely and you know i like to go to a well looking to be a day i was wondering how come you didn't like our thing and bigus i want to have to be like my uh... to go to the right i'm not sure but it's uh... they don't make him in next which is my spot is a raca come on here to a small car shavigas which one

as a schedule one drug which means it's right up there with cocaine heroin methamphetamine and uh... uh... uh... jerry stringer is perhaps the worst drugs of all mankind uh... uh... and fish food and fish food but uh... you know uh... this is just a word for that guy who was that guy hitting when he we there was a guy called any said i run a workplace and i tell people that i drug test but i don't really drug test and then that just sort of we'd out the pe凍 part of my point and we've got the people that really don't want to to go to the senate well as it was i miss that whole thing about he said that he drug test and no he's a drug test and he said that a lot of people come by and a philosophy application when they find out that the drug pre-work place that they don't hear from again is what he said all right well i think he's up to the ashes because you know he's basically just got a bunch of people that they're doing like the hard work or something you know anyway they're going up on rooms and uh... things and he's responsibly he's got the liability insurance for that i can understand that uh... i don't know man i'm gonna hear if you're still looking if you're going on any substance i don't care what is i don't want to be responsible for your uh... work or driving or whatever else you're doing you know the thing is that they might not be up on the roof and be stoned at the same time they might go home wash your springer and then be stoned and then go back to work and be perfectly straight and still fail at miserable test okay and it shows on now what about was the point i wanted to wait a while long enough to find out here's a lady in my any hello hello yes man hi how are you great how you be doing i'd be doing fine i'd like i just wanted to make a comment about the part head that called earlier that it is more for ten years yeah he said that the marijuana made him try other drugs i think that he's been betrayed as everyone also been betrayed by all the uptake people in this country because they tell you that marijuana be bad for you and it's evil and all this stuff and then when you try it and it's not that bad used to you say well they lied about this will maybe they lied about everything else too oh he never want to finish this four guys go back to Canada with his uh metal between his legs never be the same again because they found his little teeny tiny trace of marijuana we need his uh test yeah yes i say we all get on a plane go to Italy and come up a bullet all right all right see the purpose over there he's doing and if it's okay for the propok about it so good but you think that big puff of the over the Vatican is that's not the what you think it is that's the celebratory uh smoke yeah this is a celebratory in it all right what do you think they keep burning incense covered up that's why they do a lot of things that's why they put those gowns on the covered up that's why there were those kills in scallon baby covered up you're listening to the best of meal Roger on five six feet two eight out when it says hot here's what waterdale hello i've never listened to your show before but i i was interested in your deez on why why it's illegal in the first place i mean i mean it's a lot of this is there because this is a repressive society in which we live let me say it again these are kicks out of me laws that are in the book in most states in this country in which are anything except they face to face missionary position sex between married male and female what you're laughing about it okay but i true all these are kick was on the books because this is a country of hypocrites a country that's living in the stone age because we got a bunch of all the funny studies up there who don't have the balls to be peelies are kicks to be in pursuit of laws that have no place in the civilized society well in the mirror on this case hamper whatever they'll be the national debt if they would practice them and grow into the last twenty years so let me say this to you sir the idea that the federal government listen to this the federal government can tell you what seed you can plant in the back yard of your home on your property the idea that the government can legislate that is so outrageous and so unacceptable as to the inexplicable i can't argue with that one that they'll always helicopter waste in time because people are growing a few plants in their bank and the meantime up the corner kids are shooting themselves because daddy left his six his six soonerally in a while and everybody in their brother and his cuties running around with a goddamn gun but got for a bit of somebody's grown a few plants in the backyard we got the helicopters going overhead baby we're going to catch you they are the pot police are there you maniacs just like a name we don't worry to hell i do with that local section this morning here we go business man or sex per veir police this arthur van morke uh... curtain whatever is name is curtain jerkin ran a six million dollar prostitution ring how do you like that in four lot of deal you have fifty women under payroll names neatly lined up on a magnetic board under hitting such as bronze who nets in over the most the clients more than twenty thousand men between west palm beach and north mian he played a hundred eighty books and casher two hundred by credit card for acts that range from a straight sex to unusual fetishes so who the hell gives a crap probably when a clean operation probably not too many people getting no diseases from that operation probably hit it on the up and up he's going to jail everything in his god damn cutries illegal man everything is uh... the forbidden fruit if we can say on the course that's all forget that talking about a fruit forget about that everything's illegal everything's a more or less of course it's the politicians are doing it like and romer he's doing it over there and like uh... bill Clinton of course he's uh... doing it the left and right in which we like and a lot more respect and because he's getting that that's okay but if we're getting that then of course it's evil and we all go to jail juvenile and unacceptable unacceptable your brain rush baby when you're going to go just wake up and sniff it a little bit in the flowers too brainwashing goody two shoes we have to have a drinking age and we have to have a we have to have an age for everything a smoking age in other words when you're twenty one it's okay to give yourself lung cancer but if you're nineteen and that they're you're not old enough to make that decision just like that this crap about the age of majority every you know most countries where it says is just a matter of opinion most countries even some that we consider very backward uh... the legal age for the consensual sexual acts is fifteen or sixteen in this country is what seventeen for heterosexual acts and eighteen for yes you're there's a different age for heterosexual homosexual acts of course was it eighteen for both there's all these gray areas depending on which state you're in the case gay areas i said what what's well will find out what state you're in lies in the prone or uh... but it's a bit if you're more than two years older you can be sixteen as long as the person is more than two years older and over eight well isn't that it's not a bit of a night day you guys being a sixty-year old chick he's violation laws that we're saying to me something like that isn't that ridiculous yeah isn't that absurd here's a
