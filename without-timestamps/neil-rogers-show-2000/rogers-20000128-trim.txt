He's gone to a deja vu, and you know the repetitive th February engines had weapons like that kind of escalating of fateful forbid, and swing out So, uh, Mayor Maxine Elliott, Hicks, aka Maxine Elliott, is dead at 95. Nobody knows who that is. Nobody cares. I haven't got any ideas, but they're killing like a whole minute with that. Nice going, Neil. So you got to parcel this out in the notice now, the phone is out. I love it. Dead. It's all request Friday. Come on. It's up to you guys. And the kids are right at school today. It ought to be great. Just play the rack because I'm not going to discuss. Not today. No way. I'm doing a public service here today between 10 and 2. Today is only the 20th of January that hearing a set for the 6th of March, the hearing about What's in there? Yeah. So I'm not going to talk about it. Unlike, of course, 4, 6, 7 and 10, which all are writing and hell again today, together again, we're not going to play that game. We're not going to continue pounding away in a same ponderous crap that most of us with a brain don't give a flying crap about. Here's a great story by Dave Hyde and the Sun Sentinel today. Faith under fire. This is not just a great story, but very aggravating too. Well, what are these people doing now? They're not saying that. They're not saying that. No. What are they doing? They're standing worth harder. Stand worth, Hymer. I thought I smelled something like Toad Jan. Do you think he ever took a bath? In fact, that's our poll question that he took a bath last. Josh Friedman or a stand worth Hymer. That's a toss-up. That's tough. Or maybe he took one away. Dance smells better. Stand smells better in Josh Friedman. Now let's hear it for a stand. Faith under fire. This is about to say Isaac Bruce. Never trust a guy with two first names. It's like Gary Bruce. Like our buddy on CNBC. There, what's his name with the two names? Ted David. I just checking to see if you're alert. I know you're sick, but just checking. Since his 4-later day, I'll child. Isaac Bruce is found covered in his Christian beliefs, but Super Bowl week, put everything under a microscope. Sure, they don't catch him with a hook or just before the Super Bowl. You know, that would be bad. Just like Eugene Robinson. This is right, Colin. I'm going to read it by Dave Hyde. Tenetational, about all these good self-profess Christians for a whole year than now, I'm better than everybody else. Isaac Bruce is running around saying that the reason he didn't kill when he got in his car crashes, because he said, the word Jesus. Sister Mary, comfort Jesus. Just in the nicotine, just before he was going to meet his morpher maker. That's right. Just before he was going to croak. As long as you say the word Jesus, nothing going to happen to him. And about a guy named Rick Riley. How do you like that? A guy named Rick Riley from Sports Illustrated, who was doing interview, got very pissed off and told me at the mouth about the arrogance of this dickhead. Pulled out my floppy last night. Right. It was so pissed off. Just covered with a little dust. Right. So we'll talk a little bit about that, but we're not going to talk about today. So if you're looking for that, if the fox people are looking for information about that, you'll have to look elsewhere. Because we need a relief. We need a break today. And I'm not going to McDonald's. Because I'm on my lower off fat diet. I should have to buy. I give that book to my mother. I'll have to get another copy of that book. Remember I was reading the other day. The effect grams. Like the worst of all is Burger King. By the way, you take Wendy's because Wendy's when Wendy's is like, you know, heavy fat and greasy and very good. Delicious. That's what makes it good is the fat. But Burger King's got a beat. Which I don't understand that because Burger King burgers are as dry as a rubber. I always say it's like a division of a good year of a terrible rubber company. Burger King be real dry. And you want to, and that's because they boil them in those things. You know, those things like they put the pizzas through a pizza. They put them in those automatic boilers. And they keep putting that through there and just dry it out like shoe leather. But don't be disappointed. I'll do fat. And it's out there because Burger King's got them all beat. Double bopper with cheese. Man, it's got about five million grams of fat in it. That'll put you in the ground with a big smile in your face and no time at all. So I've already turned down the dunk and don't have people this morning. With our usual Friday morning, Patty with the sausage and bacon and cheese. I said, no. Oh, thank you. And then Tony, it came up from downstairs on the second floor. Is a good guy. We used to work with the WI. Everybody likes Tony. He's a great guy. Any operas said pizza's coming in today. We said, no. How do you like that? And I feel great. Low fat, high fiber. And the console, it'll really keep your regular. Just shove everything right. I'm telling you, right through you like a freight train. Like a freight train. I mean. Wow. Look out for that caboose. Woo. I think it just came out. Now you don't want to get too loose rhymes with caboose, but too loose like tracks. I'll direct. Put it anyway. I don't know. I'm a little punchy today because I'm all excited over the fact that I'm not going to talk about it. And I'll just play the wreck. Because it's obvious. We're not going to get a big response. You should have seen yesterday. You should have seen yesterday. Almost never had to give the number out. And then even after the phone system crept out, what's your will today, eventually? They came all right back pretty quick. But we don't care. I sure don't care today. I will not listen to the. The. The. The. The. The fact we may have to fan the E. Witch holes. Six remarks. You know unless something dramatic happens again unless somebody goes a little bit too loudly. No, for sure but this broad guess may be represented being compressed written permission, probably 2 AM if you recreate acquisition court unless one was shaving. What was my Sam's. D vigorous. our golf. Oh, I'm Ron. Alt hop. I. I want to apologize it's the only gets. The you and then said we need you to pay They made an offer that I thought was too Just when it was full it's so good about you He's at foot Oh He's at foot Oh He's at foot Yeah He's at foot That said we got some standards for you Just when the game is all that you gotta do You have all the drugs and lint that you've ever seen The party got a street in a lima thing He's at foot Yeah He's at foot He's at foot Yeah He's at foot He's at sea double lady Show got test They gave the school a little typo Who is? But that would set it just as other day We're gonna keep on doing what we do anyway Hey He's at foot Hey And 15 to 5.60 WQM is a Friday. It's a wonderful Friday. I got a My Excellited About It Been Friday. You know, man, and I usually, I don't go for that Cornwall crap. Oh, you know, thank God. It's Friday. All those cliches. But today, I'm really excited. It's Friday because we got the Super Bowl coming off. I excited about that. No. No. But it assures one thing on some of those. I'm really unsure it, but it is pretty good chance. At least locally here. And of course, you don't have to watch the local. If you got 15 satellite dishes like I do, I was going to say at least Sunday. We can be fairly certain for about 500 hours. We won't be here in the. I'm television here locally. But I have a feeling that there might be a few cuttings if you catch my drift. Let's see how long we can go before somebody on a show today tries to say the. The E word. Walk it on the air. You can take that to the bank. That's my final answer. 5.6705.60. Pound 5.60 on the AT&T Wireless line. My name is him. Hello. Is that your final answer? That's my final answer sir. What's up, political Neil, happy Friday. I'm back to you. All right, man. A couple things first of all. Any team dirtier in the NHL and the flyers? No. Think of the black hogs. Okay. I'd like to like to speak black. I didn't Peter. I don't. I didn't like him. He's pointless. And let me ask you that they win the game. Deal. So what does it make? Exactly. I mean, if they want to go out and put on a wrestling show, I guess he's okay. But they didn't win the game. That's what he's pointless. That's right. I agree. I'm not going to say that word. Good. And then, by the way, you know, to fail. Nobody's talking about it. But again, all they talk about is the nice pass. He made the greatest bring about a break away for the first goal. But nobody's talking about the fact that he resolved it again and losing the game. Because the Philadelphia third goal by Recky and a power play, it's fail. It's still right in front of Vernon and screen. I mean, he never had a chance. Brand played great. But there's again a spailer once again, given up the winning goal of the game. And nobody even noticed that. Precisely. Provided him from seeing a puck which he would have stopped. But spailer screens. And then one of the doubts fails. Things that you're not. Precisely. So we got Burian Whitney and Whitney and Buri. Two breakaways. One early one late and that's basically at Vernon. Burian Whitney and Whitney and Buri. And have a great day. Did Neil want first? Yes. In closing. Please. Can you please repeat the name of that. Or you said it was great for a high blood pressure. Oh, Jesus. Please. Pocius. Ladius. I don't know. I'm worried about it. You don't remember? No. Somebody will call. Okay. Neil. Okay. Two. So he's getting the schmets. What he said. Yeah. Something maybe I had the thing written down. Do I have it written down here? No. No. It's at home. Did I go on by it? No. No. Because I'm doing great. My pressure is fine. I'm doing sensational right now. Maybe this is it. Now this is a piece of a check. I took. Five six seven. Five. What do you laugh about? To piece it check. I tore up because they gave me the wrong amount. If they didn't cross brings medical center. They're the hospital. And they all year we forgot. It's also this. It must be conventional. Gender of 0. Not. If same zero. I government today saying of macefffflof crossrummestickone000.

In fact, there's a whole bunch of people in the Super Bowl this weekend who are like her criminals Where the Kathy O'Brien Catherine Facts as me this there's a website www.apbnews.com is featuring Super Bowl rap sheet highlighting criminals will be playing Sunday in Atlanta and what they've done All right, there you go you want to follow the scumbags that are gonna be playing this Sunday W-w-w-w.apbnews.com for Super Bowl rap sheets That rhymes with you got it It's 21 before 11 at 560 wqm Hunter If all real I'm One One One One One One One One One One On And When I had a bunch of dollars i went there to the place I could bitterle up a smile on the orchard from you MUSIC On I'm just gonna help make a man with the trumpet kid.

Vat this to seek out morons as witnesses. Two southern Baptist congregations are preparing a crusade and teach to remember how to convert cult members, including Mormon's and Jehovah's Witnesses. The cult awareness impact crusade is scheduled for February 60, with a Calvary Baptist Church and Ophla Baptist Church, Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are not Christians, says the Reverend Mark Courts, Calvary Senior Pastor, and the Reverend Philopennery, a system pastor for evangelism and new member of simulation. How do you like that? So they went after the Jews, they went after another, going after other Graham, and they just won't stop. The goddamn Baptist, just will never stop. Will they stop? No. Lunatics. Here's a mobile in top of no, hello. Hey, I'm going to allow our ears to read. I have a vote also, instead of not just banning the E word, have a banning baby Jesus as well. Okay. Can you imagine if we didn't have the satellite issue, be stuck watching this all day long? I'm not. But I'm not. Do you know, by the way, on the satellite, when we stop getting the free previews of the locals? Oh, January 9th, 19 days ago, but don't tell anybody. Really? Yeah. You're getting a February. Well, they first said January 9th, and I already got mine, and I'm paying for it, of course, like a good legal voice. So I have no idea. Just don't say it too loud. Certainly. I have to tell you, Neil, I'm out in the road all day long. You're the sole voice of reason in this town. My whole family listen to you. We all love you. Yes, I am. Thank you, sir. I just want to make it a make a share of the best. I don't think you like. How about the guy trying to buy the Chinese restaurant? No, I have a great day. No. Like I said, almost anything you like. No, not things that have been, you know, I can't do that. No, I know Jack and a box. No Chinese restaurant sale. No way. No, no. The answer is no. But have a great weekend anyway. 560, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50. See the object of these shows is to be entertaining. I know that comes to the shock to some of the sports that are done in station. The object is to be entertaining. That's just a kid sucked in with the same repetitive boring drone and crap by people in New York. Even though this was a good guy, but nevertheless, he just didn't get it. Jimmy, you know what I'm talking about things like that. Very pond-rissing, very, very, terminally boring, even a moron couldn't listen to. Over and over and that's going to be our poll question. By the way, would you do right over here? Jimmy and Danny or the f***y word? Not that you'll hear either one here, but that's tough. That's a tough one. It's nip and tuck. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami? Yeah, yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah, yeah. What do you think about the game last night? Which game was that? The Panther game? Yeah. They are they lost. I know. Yeah. But why does the kick to the Panther's jump at a glendos? But when, let me ask you this, what difference does it make me lost? The fights are when the loser loses the game. They lost. They lost because of shot defense at the first period. This is true. Uh-huh. And you enjoy that fight between Warl and Warl? No, I did not. I'm not interested in fights unless there's a, you know, that has something to do with the game. Peter Warl is just a side show, a circus, a freak show. He adds nothing to the game. And he did the same thing in McCarthy. Either one of them should be in the league. And have a great day. You enjoyed that fight? Hey, do you know how to do that? No, they lost the game. See, I don't enjoy it when you lose the game. Now you're one of those people. Hey, come on, Warl. Hit somebody, Warl. Like those red nests that sit up there, Rami. Come on, Warl. Occasionally, this sit up there. More, more. But, you know, if we have all the rest of the seats filled with their usual people, there are no red nests up there. Thank God. There's the cavity old-sour look on his face. This is behind me there in the first row, but he ain't going to change. You're going to change? No. I think he's stuffed. Here's Miami. Hello. The account is is a wear of the making information. And you're going to be calling him shortly about that. Then you're calling him in the account. Okay. Okay. You? Yes. Any idea? That's pretty interesting. I thought that we were going to get into that level of some kind of a good drug deal or something there. No, but I'm sorry about that. That's okay. No, I just have two questions. Those Carlos, does that like your boyfriend? I know. I know weekends. Okay. How do I get a copy of, um, you know, a little bit of the put solution in the basket? Yeah. How do I get, you have CD for anything like that? Yeah. That's on the best of meal. It's on, uh, you got Carl Center 1, 563, 3600 in Broward. Okay. And they got it. Or you can just go to, if you got a computer, I would think so. Some big shot like you. I do. I am a big shot. There you go. Nearrogors.com. That's our website. Nearrogors.com. You can order it right off of there if you like. Okay. My other question, Near. This Peter wore a guy. It works for the lotion. It's a basket. Yeah, sir. No. They got a name Peter, right? Well, let me ask you this. If the panthers can get, uh, uh, a plug like that. Uh, is this like a, you think this is going to be like a, uh, uh, uh, a trend that's going to be happening in any cell. No, you're just going to get black guys and just, you know, pound that in everybody else. No, because the other black guys like Donald Berchier, for example, Tyson Ryan Cooper, at least he's a player. Now, the one he has other skills. He can, you know, once a month or a month, when a guy comes, he has a lot of skills. He can do more than just go out there and get stupid penalties and get in the dumb fights. So no, I don't think so. Okay. All right. That's the deal. Have a great life pal. Say how to Carlos for me. Oh, thank you. Okay. Okay. Oh, what would you say to Carlos when we came out in a conversation? I want to give you a kiss. Yes, something like that. I thought 560560 pound, 560. God, I feel better already. Just almost an hour of e3 radio. I mean, what does their left to say? Every guy in the story, look, I heard the father says there was a bribery attempt in this one said it and sister Jean had freaking none. What do you expect from a freaking cat like none anyway? Although, I thought she and Janet would have had more of a meaning of the mind. You know, I thought there would have been on the same page. So to speak, or on the same caught. Yeah, we know about those nuns. We know about those nuns and those priest. But of course, keep in mind. All your kids out there are offers from school that they just keep in mind. There's no fact in the church. Right. Just run like hell, though, if they get anywhere near you. Run like a mother. In fact, run like hell and scream from other. Or just like Isaac Bruce is, run like hell in yellow. Sister Mary, Catherine, Jesus. That might save you. Here's Miami. Hello. Maybe one of you are pretty good. Next to them, to the radio this morning and, and that is the reason why I'm looking for the new one. Right. But the way I know about that in the lifetime again, I was got to call you the thing that disconnected. Yeah. I'm glad I'm going to cross here. I'm glad this is you, Neil. Good. I'm glad you're doing this. I least someone got a co-honest to do it in this stuff. Big one. Big number one. Okay. I'm getting that user. I'll pay for this weekend. All right. Okay. Fine. Maybe Isaac Bruce will pray for this week. I think it goes out there in the Super Bowl. Yeah. I'm going to root for Nashville. I'm going to root for this weekend. Does anybody read a carrot? No. No. Of course they have a gambling interest. Wow. By the way, I don't want to say that Joe Costellum, I'm a close person for the yesterday. Was talking to that most of our little sportsers we have around this place. Have real gambling problems. Because they all want to be tanked juniors. He's got all these people like they all got their own bookies and they got like, oh, they're up. Yeah. They got guys that are threatened to come by and break their legs in the middle of the daytime. All kinds of problems here. So the little sports nerds right here. They're just as confused as like it. Redd supports pan engineers have to be like a degenerate gambling. Just a bedding interest in the game where you have militaries. See. That to me is very sad. That to me is tragic. Although to be honest with you. The only way I would have any interests in the Super Bowl is having a bedding interest. Which I will not because that old bit on football. But I'm root for the Tennessee Titans. Now just because the Rams, the St. Louis Rams, and of course they're criminal Lover Coach Dick from one of my little rack-gome. who's almost as good as Jimmylancean. What it comes to love in those criminals. Remember, he was the first one to give Lawrence Phillips a shot. He said, we got a shot. And plus all these religious goodytoshes there on St. Louis. Wouldn't it be sad if somehow Jesus doesn't hear their prayers on Sunday? I wouldn't have to be a bad break. Like this Isaac Bruce and his mother, what's her name? Cateria Pethetics. I'm like that. With her 85 kids. 15 children. And he was one number to think he was by the way. Speaking of Jimmy and Danny, what number do you think he was? Number 13. Oh, I think it's an oldman. How do you like that? Isaac was the 13th of 15 children's. I'll get to that table. I'd call him. It's great. And he says, as long as you yell out. Sister Mary Catherine. Jesus. Or some crap like that. You'll be okay. Even if there's a speeding bullet coming to your head. Sister Jesus. And look at it. Just like stops. Just like Superman stuck his hand of steel out there. Right in front of your forehead. Before we hit your head. And made you dead. Nice going there Isaac Bruce. What are they saying about Isaac Bruce by the way? He's an asshole. Here's North Miami. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Pretty good sir. First time call out long time this man. All right. You all right. Listen, but I got two quick questions for you. Oh, man. Just remember that. You ready? I'll be to bomb. Yes. How many cows did it take to take to supply and I saw footballs in the year? And the second one is the second one in the Super Bowl. Yeah. You got the answer to the first one? Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T. Were all this line? He was good. But you know something I read here a thousand calories just like him. Then here. The E word. I read here 50,000 drooling idiots that ever hear one more word about that swirl. And you people at four six seven and ten ABC CBS NBC Fox Schloss. Everybody else. You're a bunch of idiots. And CNN and see it well not TNBC. At least they got some stocks to up on it. How's the market doing today? Everybody in their brother that's talking about the guy. They're going to get the market. And how is it that we managed? It's already the 28th of January. We managed to get this far. Was there a big Y2K crisis? No. There's more B.S. from the media by the way. Other markets down. Let's not talk about that. Let's go back to a much music. And that's blind that the Nick from the 98 degrees. That blind that he's a bangin' allegedly. She's okay. What's your name, Jessica Smith? Something. Simpson. Okay. Todd Simpson. Sister. Jessica. Better be on your best behavior, Jessica. Because Todd's got a pretty mean right hand. We saw that last night. Eric's. He's woozy about it right now. But you know what? They still want to come. God damn it. Hey, wouldn't that happen? But I guess it made Terry Murray feel more like a man. You know, all these guys went out there and beat some crap out everybody else. Although, Sanning McCarthy see forget about Lindros. Sanning McCarthy. He deserves that like a bunch of big guys. Just beat the snout out of hand. He makes me sick. He's an Indian. You know, I'm sorry. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going? Great. Okay. Hey, I want to call on the sense you bought a few things that you did to the dead first. I'm a spark. There here in the morning. He really sparked this. And I'm going to get a satellite. Yes, sir. Here's the start to what the satellite did. All right. Yeah, I had this just 1995. That's what you know, as Bubba said that in the speech last night. He said before he leaves off his next year. He wants to make sure that every sports or America's got their one satellite. That's that's going, Baba. Yeah. I mean, I had to think to 1995 that the test moved out every day. That's why I had to make it out there last night. Hank has peddling the satellite dishes now. Yeah. And also, I want to wait any more than half a month to do a show in a better friend of yours. Jason. Jason. Yeah. Jason. Yeah. He's a close friend of mine. Yeah. He's a little white guy. You know, he's about five, five. Is he from this station? Jason Blouse, Bob. I don't know. He was out of waiting up in the house. Almost in your area. I have no idea who that is. Okay. I want to thank you and I went by nearly the way they're getting this six pack on nearly burgers. All right. And a white hot to kick it on down there. And I want to make a share of what you do with that white hot pod. Yes, sir. I think it's one of those things. All right. This is for George. If you can play that just in a circumstance when he says George. You got it. Appreciate having nice day. Okay. Have a great life. There's a share to with a satellite dish. Who do we're making progress under this president? Did I tell you that? That's right. Even the dark guys got satellite dishes. So they have to sit there and watch the same old. I hired crap around the clock. Yeah, you four six seven and 10. You guys just wait till I have everybody this time with their own satellite. This, so we got a lot more choices instead of just getting stuck with that cable or your little god damn rabbit ears and the same bunch of boring lunatics. Who don't want to give us any information or news of programming for people with speaking about it? That's what we're really pissed off. We're waiting for a wait and let's see a news cat. Let's see a program for somebody who speaks English no matter where the hell they came from. Even if they're like, uh, you know, we don't care where they're like I said yesterday. I don't care where they're from. If they look good, bring them on. That's what I told Miguel is morning he ran down the hall. Yeah, he was pretty fast. So what he said, four minutes before 11 at five, 60 WQ. QAM drops the green flag with motorsport Saturday Saturday morning set six with Chocustelo right here on Sports Radio 560 QA came. For radio 560. Who else do you think? I can't afford to. Not just my troubles to the Hebrew school. My uncle he'll say it's something to do. I bet that I was laughing there and I won't get time. I wonder how he'd do that. I wanted to circumcise. I told him that I wasn't fine with Chocustelo. He said 50, but he could not. This is a little sad. It's fine. I said he had the time. It was pretty much longer. I wanted to circumcise. He said he's done the round and gave me a way. He said I'm gonna cut it on right here in the frame. I felt the dirt and took it and then I thought it was free. I crossed my drawers, I thought of Chocustelo. I found he's got a week. I could have seen it on the left or the right. I don't need no more cheese for fun at times. I used to see a large body from the down side. I called him back and came up. I just been circumcised. I brought my drawers out of George. I need God's week. I couldn't feel it. I only left the whole right. I only knew my cheese would've got it. Now they're coming in. It's better to show them with the guys. I want them to hang and go over. I'm just circumcised. I just circumcised. I'm just circumcised. You called that, Nina? I don't feel it. I'm just circumcised. I'm about to look five, six, and you can't see it. I made it through one solid hour without the E were. You only placed in town where you can escape. Ladies and gentlemen, right here. Dave Heitz is. I'm not going to read the four play in here about the. What's the spirit of the. What are the marines? Name is in the 85 kid. He says this isn't just the football. We go. It's a week where anything goes and everything usually does. So Isaac brought us the next about this car accident and become the ultimate Super Bowl story. A player with strong convictions, meeting waves of reporters demanding. Know these strong convictions. Jesus, bruish out at two months ago after the rear tire of his Mercedes convertible. Blood on a Missouri highway. Well, I mean, if you're very tired, blue out. You probably love Jesus Christ. Also, throwing the car out of control on the highway. He jerked his hands from the steering wheel. The car flipped twice. Everyone to exploded. Bruce wasn't wearing a seat belt and there's recent accident. To ball the gas lights have shown. The odds are a Terry headline comes out of this. In fact, these other accidents have become part of the Super Bowl story. Bobby feels the pro basketball player was racing his car into not where he felt died in accident three weeks ago. The retomest the pro football player wasn't wearing a seat belt. Let's paralyze the next in this week and a riding companion was killed. Bruce says he doesn't know their fate can't explain their actions. But what he says when asked about their fate and when he repeats when he kept being asked is, this could never have been me. Why? Because of my belief and my faith in God. He said, I yelled off the name of Jesus. There's no other name you can yell out and be saved. The name is a weapon to protect you. Even if you yell out, they'll die. That won't do it. It's got to be Jesus. A group report is asking about this. Bruce sits there with a little emotion. As one of them, Rick Riley of sports illustrated. You ignorant slut. Wonders directly about golf or pain, Stewart's tragic fate. A Christian, a plane ride, a dethrot for everyone on board. How can explain his death Riley asks? There are certain rights you have as a Christian, just like as a driver you have certain rights Bruce says, but you have to put into key. You have to call out the name Jesus. If he'd called it out, he'd be saved. How do you like that? How come nobody told him that? I hate when that happens. Poor pain, Stewart. If he just want to call out Jesus, I just want to eat a house. That's all that. All of that. So man can go with all the water companies. We are Chinese too. Thank you, man. That will teach you to make fun of the Goose there, Peter. I mean, the pain. What are he's a pain? There is the anger growing from reporters and confusing the parent Bruce says to Riley, I'm ministering on plenty of seed in you. Squirt's court is what he said. Well, I guess his mother knows about that with 85 kids. In Broward, a sister is at home of fasting until noon each day in praying for St. Louis in his super bowl. Let's pray for the Titans. What he said. Another sister was a pastor and a lot of the relates church. Two weeks ago before a playoff game against Minnesota, Bruce called his mother on a cell phone from the locker room after tweaking a bodice and hamstring in practice. She was at the store. He began calling brothers and sisters, finally getting older sister, Julianna Joseph. Julianna Joseph? Maybe she's related to Curtis. Pray with me he said they did. He said his hamstring was healed because of it. He called four passes for 133 yards in a touchdown that game. Because they prayed for him, obviously. Is that right? Uh-huh. The bruises are a loving family, a good family, and especially close family. The father Jesse is a retired roofer. God with 85 kids, how do he be having time to work? Carey, the kerrathia pathetic, whatever her name is. Even once you kicked the kids out of the house, knew they were staying down at the roofing business office and said, I would drive by secretly and check up on him. Otis Gray, now the dealer that led it to record tells how many of the bruises children played sports for Dullard Steanshand, who Perhaps Will comes tonightitely these three, the purchase bill is in the future. So today you're going to try various places and funnily for which you're a flushing plant which could be good for the future. The referee who has 1500 balls in his intenters and 135 spots and all three absolutely won't see it. Fifty holidays these weekend. They arrived consistently all four, just like when the robbery was finished. Why would you allow me to watch that fight for you perhaps over this long Georgia? Can I tell you if you prepared to be on theOUGHER? one others died. The original skepticism opened outing an understandable wondering. Some Super Bowl's religion story is for more NFL great-reggie-wife-something loudly about his beliefs and those homeless. Some Super Bowl's that did light a safety Eugene Robbett did accepting a Christian award for his high moral character in the morning before the game and being arrested for solicitation the same night. This Super Bowl is partially court-worned as the same as the court of the Quidditch's faith for allowing him to keep the faith in his talent when no one else did, but more dramatically its Bruce who's horse remains calm and answers keep coming even as the questions do. I want to continue that discussion Marley said upon returning to Bruce after 15 minutes what about Cassie Bernal who's she Bruce answered who that be. Riley said she's the column by high school student who had a gun put in her face while being asked do you believe in Jesus she said yes she was blown away. Bruce he wouldn't have blown me away. I would have treated the blood of Jesus. I say I've played the blood of Jesus and it wouldn't have gone off and the gun either. Are you folks following this? Yeah. Riley I think it's a fence for you to say that I think it's a fence of any Christian who died in the tragedy. I think you've ticked off a lot of people today. Bruce I think you've ticked off a lot of people. Riley you ticked me off I think it's offensive and stupid. Bruce are you calling me stupid? Riley I'm saying what you said is stupid. Bruce we're done talking Riley walked away. I don't you're like that as he did in the perfect ending to another Super Bowl day as the epitap to the other Super Bowl controversy and a story that began hundreds of miles away in the streets of Fort Lauderdale. Bruce said God bless you or I think he said. Damn God. I think that's what he really said well that's yeah. How do you like that another arrogant Christian with his Jesus crap? See nobody gonna mess with him because he's gonna say Jesus is just at the right time. Let's pray for the Titans right? Okay. I am so sick and tired of these goodly two shoes like if there were such a thing as a God which we all know that there's not but if there were he's busy praying for athletes that he picks and chooses which teens he likes. How do you like that? Yeah. Let's go and guide in exercises and right now let's cancel you. We can evil spell on the St. Louis ring and make sure Tennessee kicks their big fat smelly of Super Bowlages as this Sunday. What do you say? All right. 560560 palm-five 16 on the AT&T line. Here's a mobile and coral spring. Hello. Yes sir. How are you today? Great. Great. I was listening to the first team this morning when they were talking about Lendros and some guy called in and said he'd only heard two people that his whole career. And I remember back for the year of the rat when he was playing against us. Yeah. He was cutting this up with his stick. I haven't seen that much blood since O.J. Right. And I couldn't believe I needed 30 as player in the league. Or at least one of the top three or four dirtiest players in the league is no question about that. The guy is a butcher. Yeah. But at the meantime, what they weren't talking about is the fact that they let him stand in front of the net there and keep banging away and banging away and poking it in there for that second to let off you goal. Did anybody mention that? No. No. He stuck it right in there. Right. The fact that T.C. Spacic was standing there watching while a Simon Gagne kid was banging away on his own rebound and put in there first goal. He might mention that. Oh, that Robert Spayler was screaming out my curtain on the third and winning goal. Anybody mentioned that? No. See, that's all they can relate to is the fight. And Warwell did this and Lendros is dirty. But in the meantime, Philly still won against you. That's bad. Very bad. Real bad. Quintorious? OK. Thanks, sir. You got to have a great day, sir. All right. Can we say that on a year by the way, Quintorious? No. Oh, I'm just playing it. 9 minutes after 11 at 5. 60 WQM. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers. Of the Superf Taylor, Fabio, share. They all have celebrity perfume. Now from the right house comes the first perfume of the Clinton era. Hillary, the name is notari. Hillary, the woman is the Taurus. Hillary, the leader. Is notari. Part Hillary, art, notorious. The new perfume from Hillary Clinton. Quintorious, Taurus. What's that smell? That's my Quintorious. Mm-hmm. I love it. Nothing smells white like it. smell it. I can't even find it. Is that it? No. Is that it? Nope. How about this? Nope. It's a little part of the find. But once you do, holy Maceral, it's great. Look for that you're perfume, Kevin. Post office or at the beaten deck. Hi, I'll fix this Hillary Clinton. And you love my Quintorious. Look for it in the little red box, Clinton Taurus. So little red has the Tantarina last the sister, Jean went to get off her plane and washing and what's that smell? And sister Jean said, I just brought along with me a fish sandwich for the right. 14 pounds to 11 at 5.60 WQM. Can't you see, Janet trying to grab that sandwich? They're a good hold of that thing. I'm sorry, that's bad. That's really, it keeps flipping out of her hand. And the sandwich, too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pomp 5, 60 on a AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady in dear field. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. No, I'm so glad to hear you. I've been listening to you for many years. And I wanted to let you know that yesterday in the today show. I don't know if you heard about it, but Frasier's wife, Kelsey Glamour, the actor. Yeah. And Frasier, so to speak, he said that she has ideas. And that she wants the public to be aware of it. And then we collect money from charity. Collect money for what? So that people... For better diet, for better food. Because she's... Or maybe collect money so we can all be carried on. I can put up with those stress from the assholes we were for. That sounds good to me. Oh, the seven years she said she's been suffering with it. And that she had problems getting up during the day and trying to figure out what she could do. She could cut in the middle of the day and she had to go run through the bathroom. Really? At a moment's notice and she couldn't live her life like that anymore. So she went to several doctors, like you did, and several testings. And she finally saw that the doctor said that she had a IBS and with diet and knowing that she needs stress, that she has stress a time. Yeah. That she was going to... She was able to control it. I'd say it's not clear that. No, I never goes away. But never goes away completely. It's kind of like, well, like being ugly, you know. Oh, no. But yeah, she can control it. She wants the public to be aware of it. She wants everyone to know that it's not a quote quote, you know, duty disease or anything. No. I do need to be. Right, that's a little bit of a point. Right. Anyway, I don't know if you saw the Panther Game last night's, Linda Ross, who got penalized for the tripping of Whitney. Yeah. Excuse me. Well, he sat in the penalty box and Whitney was giving him some words. You didn't need a lip read at the hear. What the hell this man was saying? Yeah. I mean, I couldn't believe I said, this is just guys that no class. Well, let Ross, but in the meantime, he scored a goal in it and they won the game. So I mean, everybody keeps talking about what an asshole he is and about Peter did this and I worked in that. But they won the game. He's not all account. But we only just come back, but they won the game. I know. I know. I just hope they did. And let me ask you, would you take him an R team in about five seconds? Excuse me. I didn't hear that. Would you take Eric Lindhurst on the Panthers? Oh, absolutely. I love that. Yeah. Have a great day, sweetheart. And take the BS out of the IVF. Yeah. On the guy that took the BS out of the IVF and we took the E out of this. So today, Tio Castellos in her day, you'll be pleased to know that it's an E free Friday. We're not allowing the E word on the show today. Got into an hour and a quarter already. Nobody's even tried to slip it in there and the word either. We're very pleased that I have very proud of this group so far. We're giving you a little relief, a little release, a little bit of a vacation from the incessen. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. That they keep doing it was okay. And if we find a local channel here, which I seriously doubt, but if we're at an local channel, that's willing to write us with entertainment for people at Arnold and I'll be glad to let you know what to want to do. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 on an all-request Friday, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line. The other town line. We're going to have a look at those people today, 877-785-6345. I mean, we're talking about anything and everything and absolutely not the **** he word so you think, hey, there's my good friend, Ken Maldon, who said, oh, he said the E word. Oh, he just said he's exasperated, whatever that he got his exasperated because they preempted his up the history to a clock because Hank was talking to some bozo. I was very upset about that when I preempted Ken Maldon. You don't mess around with Ken Maldon on his station, okay? You'll have to step over my dead body to mess with Ken Maldon. He's one of the few guys we've gotten this building that there's an IQ larger than his thumbnail. I like about Ken Sitzin at the bullpen in there, keeps watching all the old races from biscuit and at the video thing and it's great. Here's Fort Lauderdale, hello. Bless me, Father, for I have said yes. Yes, the way that though all these athletes talk about Jesus and God of the price that no one has tried to craft Jesus or God, we wipe right to them, get them on your team. Yeah. How many yards did God rush for this season? Yeah. So I would think that would be a good addition to the game. Yesterday, Neil, I went and had. I sure missed this game, Ken. I'll try to do that. What a great place that was before this march is all over the nonsense. What is it, sir? Yes, I had another analitmature yesterday. I had the flexible sigway to scope. Yeah. It sounds like you're suffering the actor, if I had to be honest with you. You sound a little bit litardgic from it. Yeah. And what was the thing? I was saying, I was going to scope. Yeah. I don't know. I think you only went into what dirt of the coal. We're not going to go back for the whole deal of the coal. Oh, what else could be? Do they find anything? Yeah. They did? Yeah. Like what? At the dying pile of. Oh, getting better. And then didn't they slip it out? No, this was just the, this was just a survey crew. Yes, now they go back into the excavation. Okay, well, good luck, pal. These are cake, no problem. The coal else could be as much, much easier than the sigmood else could be. Because they give you that shot. You're going to laugh. You're like, you don't remember anything. You don't remember a real thing. You don't remember a real thing. Right. I suppose that the sigmood must be where you're white awake and they stick that thing and they keep pushing and twisting and yanking. Okay. Hang on with me. This one more second. I just want to take a look over here and it is Jan that thing in there. And the scope, too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line. God, what a difference from yesterday. If you, I feel great. I feel so relieved. And I'll confess to you that last night I went to publics and I got myself a little pint, just a pint of healthy choice, pre-lean crunch, low fat ice cream. See, two meals a week on his diet, you can cheat. You can have anything you want without gorging. And the whole pint only had a grams of fat. Did I gain any weight? No. My blood sugar this morning was 110. Oh, it was very nice to me. So this low fiber, high, high, high, high fiber diet. It seems to work in tremendously. I agree with me. It's not for everybody. If you don't act in great, if you don't generate great and if you do not look at it, I look at it, I'll pick you and put my guts out of that. That's fine too. Whatever works for you. But this is great for me. I feel sensational. Now that everybody else is getting sick. You look thinner. I look thinner. Yeah, right in the. Oh, yeah. See, that's always the first place I lose the weight. You want me to lie to you in the exercise. I get his move in my gum. I like that. Seriously. Every time I go on a diet where I lose weight, the first place is in my cheeks. Black gums on those cheeks. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no. Yes, sir. God bless you, man. God bless us. Hey, and Jesus, don't forget him. Don't want to get Isaac up. The thing is that people, they can't admit the down their own. They need some leaders. They need a crutch. Yeah, they need somebody to vote on to the. They can't admit that they're on their own. They're not wrong with someone to hold on to. I mean, sounds good to me. They're not to me, boy. Anyway, they just they they can't admit that they're on their own. And they need a leader. They need somebody to hold on to and. To other people out there, they're like their questions. And they believe in. So called God. Yeah, you're on your own, but he you're on your own. Peace. Amen. Amen, brother. 5. 6. 7. 5. 6. 6. On the 18. 8. And again, there's a lot of Rick Riley there. From a sports illustrator, whoever the hell he is, I thought there was really only one Rick Riley. I need help. But it turns out there's one another one. Who was very offended and very aggrost out as he should have been by Isaac Bruce. And he's idiotic comments. He's the real Christian. Well, the real Christian, please stand up. Better than everybody else. Hold here than thou. Nothing. Go to get him because he's got Jesus on your side. Man. I know what I'd like to see. Let's let's have Isaac Bruce after the Super Bowl winner lose. come back to Fort Lauderdale, time to the railroad tracks over there on Dixie Highway. Oh, seriously. And when a train comes along, say, okay, Isaac, you yell out for Jesus and see if that train stops or what what be happening. I said it would be fast. Put it live on Channel 7, have Rick Sanchez squatting over the tracks. In fact, maybe we could tie him right next to Isaac sounds good. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello, now. Yes, sir. Are you doing great? Good. I can gain last night off. Yeah, the least game. We've seen Rangers. Now I'm a fire fan. Oh. Yeah. I don't know. I would be honest with Andrew Watchtell much of it. I was watching Bubba. So I was taping the leafs game and taping the panther game. I saw some of it. And then of course, I watched the or fights in a little light. I saw the goals because they were on the first period. The ones are counted. And then I saw Rick with his break away at the end of the empty net cool. So I didn't miss too much. So the which is stupid fights. Okay. Yeah, well, I'm just calling this the, I heard you're, so many listeners, I trouble getting tickets to, you know, tickets to the games. You know, through the, uh, ticket office at the arena. Tickets to what game to any game. See, uh, oh, yeah, people that have it in the problems, right? Because nobody answers the phone allegedly. Right. My roommate, you know, he, he never watches hockey games. Not really hockey fan, but I told him the last to game last night. And I went to work and I came home for work. And he said, man, that was exciting game. He said, uh, is that want to go to a game? There you go. I got on the phone this morning to take a mess. I didn't talk to a human being and had no problem getting tickets. For the out of the game coming up on off that work president. Uh, and, uh, yeah, he's looking forward to it. No, it's just another can be excuse. I mean, if you want to tickets, you're going to get him. You know, there's just another dumb excuse. These people, this is a ton of excuses. Right. Did you notice the attendance left by at the house at the Core State Center? No, I did not. I was, I'm sure standing were mulling. Okay, it holds 19,000, five hundred people on 19,000, seven hundred. Right. You should have wondered that. And of course, in Toronto, we have over 400 standing from every night every single home game. But I don't confuse these people with the facts. Okay. That's all I got to. You know, from getting tickets to the game, if you really want to go. Okay. I'll see you there, proud. I buy. Yeah. We got the big Edmonton game coming up tomorrow. And I realized they're not in our conference. And that one of the really great teams in league, but they're a young exciting team to watch. And we should be to start out of my with it. You know, they have no defense. Kind of like us. And, uh, it's going to be real interesting to see. Like Dave Joseph said, yes, today, how many people show up for that game after watching almost 4,000 empty seats for the New Jersey devil's together. But you can keep talking about it and talking about it. And you just can't force these people something good. They'd rather have their vanilla ice cream. They'd rather talk about Jimmy and Danny and Davey and this same old crap. They're boring, boring, boring place. You got something exciting, something great going on. And all I started doing is rattling off the excuses. And let me tell you right now, I'm arranging with the Panther organization. We're going to have a bunch of security guards see their taken surveillance tape. They got the pictures. This is a new technology. They've got the facial pictures of everybody who's coming all against. You don't even need to have one of those punch cards I suggested. And if you show off it, try to buy tickets to the playoffs. They're going to like see your posts. They're going to say sorry. You can't come in. How do you like that? Sorry. Sorry, Mr. You can't come in. I hear you knock into it, but you can't come in because you're a far-running phony. We don't want any you know, Mo. Front running phony, phony, baloney town. And they get the banners out like with a Marlins. You know, oh, we love the Marlin. Yeah, right. When you win the world serious, see there's some places that are real sports towns. And there are the places that are not like Pittsburgh for example. That's another bogus town twice they've almost lost the penguins came with an a whisker. They got your armor. You're out of the second most exciting player in a guy named Wormstone. They're a brewery. And they can't fill up that place. They realize they were playing a girl's team at land, but they should have been salivating at the mouth to see that to see them knock this knot, which they did out of the trashers. Did they fill it up? No, they usually don't fill them up. You only think they support and Pittsburgh is the stevers. They fill up the pirates. No, they've had they've almost lost that a million times too. There are some towns that are real sports towns like Detroit. Detroit is one of them. Name you another one. That's it. Not Boston. There's a billion at the seats in that fleet center. Not Chicago, billion at the seats in a that new state and they got for the black cops. Huh? For all the teams. Yeah, well what's the real sports town? I mean the rangers, but of course they got 15 million people to draw from. And you have to be in here at those got them to get 18,200 for me. I'm glad that we're 18,200 last night at Sputton, the fact we played Murray Healy to see Steve Thomas score a pair as the least one in the last minute. How many three over the rangers? I'm glad there were 18,200 people there to see the maple leaves. 26 after 11 at 5. 61. First time in 10 years they won an Ed building. Let's hear it for Steve Thomas. I don't hear Steve. I don't hear Steve. I don't know why they're going. Hey, Hoover. I'll stay more in my. I'm getting through a bedroom with gold. All right. I thought they'd have to do my work. I want to do that. I want to do that. You was crippled. I got it going to do. It's your play for the fish. I guess my girlfriend forgot that she's. I think I looked it. It was all this while I hear of the one that's meeting me and Hilsel And I found out and why did Chase be with us? Where did that big turn? It's a love of 31. It's great. From the Landover Baptist Church, the Valtz Satanist Ricky Martin orchestrates his sexually motivated invasion on American morality. This is from the Internet, of course. One of the devil's favor ways to corrupt his soul is through music. The Bible tells us that Lucifer was an angel of life. It was a he that set by God's side and strummed a sacred guitar before legions of angels. It was he who was in charge of organizing heaven's hymnals, but he fell from glory and since that faithful lay has been nothing but a boil on the backside of every Godfaring American citizen in this country. Back to him, you got it. As Christians, we need to keep our eyes peeled open for the devil's next move. He's a slick one, but for the Christ-centered man, he's easy to catch. Recently Satan is begun to raise the stakes in the Holy Couser Ward, which we are currently engaged. Ricky Martin is the devil's latest inestitapering way to sidetracked the faithful. One of those possibly already stuck into your home undivided. Murkey Martin's latest song, Living La Vida, Loka, Landover, Linguist Translate, this is living in for the devil in God's English. It's causing young girls to have sex and get pregnant at the age of 10. This Latin heart drop recently dedicated his life to Satan. Recent reports indicate that he put the banana in his pants when he goes on stage. He can't think for sh**. Young in person, the old teenage girls are then intoxicated with a frightening, satanic frenzy. He has people staying up all hours of an identical and sleeping in until noon. This ringleader of immorality was blessed by the Pope himself. The Pope called him an angel. We know that Mr. Martin is nothing more than the devil's superstar, a recruiter for Satan's army. After compromising his artistic integrity by leaving a satanic children's music group Manudo, which translates roughly to Pigg intestines cooked up in the soup as an offering to Satan, he has to devil's plan of unparalleled scope. He's orchestrating a sexually motivated invasion on the Protestant morality that has kept his nation intact for nearly 300 years. The invasion of the Beatles was a tiny threat compared to this one. And it goes on and on. There you go Ricky Martin. He can't think for sh**. Is the devil god demo with the banana in his pants? 560560, Pond 560 on the 18T wireless line. He's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes, thank you. Yes, thank you. I'm glad. I'm calling about a new project that they're going to they want to start in home state. The home stereo port? I don't have to be heard about that. No. Oh well, since they're talking so much about the E word. They are having talking about that. About the environmentalists not allowing me or port going up because of the alligators in the birds and the ever late. I don't want to mess with those gators. Oh well, it's like an hard harm to them. Yeah. They did an environmental impact statement across $5 million. The federal government did it and it says it won't do anything to them. Can't beat that gator meat? That's right. Oh well. Okay, take care. Thanks. I think you're in a way. I think she was looking person to figure out what we're going to care about. We already got Opalachia. Interesting. How we got to see somebody in the little local airports featured in the last week or two. And that pretty interesting. Opalachia airport, Tammy, any airport. Let's get North Perrier port.

Five six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T where this line. Here's North Miami. Hello. Hey, New York, Williams. Great. I hope you have a good day. Question. I don't have a great day.

I wonder what the overall world for the sisters contribution was the very university. I'm going to want to craft. I don't believe. Religion is the National Council of Churches. That bunch of comedy, pinkal bastards in the Catholic Church and sister Jean and Janet Reno. What a what a crew. And I heard that I think was great, but I know how vivid it is. They already offered the part of tuna. No, see there we go again. He started to talk. See how to that. See, I guess maybe you weren't listening in the beginning, sir. This is an E-free, they know no much of any of that crap. Don't you understand? No, no. No, the answer is no. Just say no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You got it? No. That's what I was afraid of. I'm not interested, sir. I don't care. I don't care if they offered daddy $50 billion. This is not the Green Stamps. I don't care. I want peace. I want release from this. I want freedom. I want my freedom. Freedom to breathe to think without being invested with that crap. 56050560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Let's pray for those goddamn titans. What do you say? Yeah, we were pulling for our Tennessee. I hope FC man. All right, Diego. That's right. Good think I never thought about that. AFC, maybe Tennessee titans kicks him serious ass. Kick those religious nuts all the way to came. Kick the rash to hell is what I say. Maybe they'll run into Ricky Martin with a banana and his thing. I already got a banana. I don't want to say it. Here's a pepper pie and tell of meal. Yes, sir. I was just listening to you several days ago and I heard you talking about co-cute can. Yes. What else goes with it? What else goes with it? Well, you said you had carcass in a pear tree. I mean, what does anyone else goes with it? Now you were taking something else, con droiden or con droiden or something that goes with it because I said far straight and cops something like that. What about does that mean con droiden? I don't know. I went to get to co-cocache for what? Taking for what? Well, I'm taking a full of gasses. Oh, okay, because I was kind of like the way you were as just a thorgic and the way did I just don't have any energy. Right. You know, when I I'm co-cute 10 isn't what I mean, I might give you the energy, but it's great for your heart. It'll get your pulse down and it's tremendous for your heart. Yeah, because everybody manufacturers co-cute 10, but in most of us not enough. Yeah, because I've got very high blood pressure and I heard you talk about that. Well, if you got a heart problem, co-cute 10 is a must. It's good. It's great. Not good. It's great. Oh, okay, but I thought I heard you mentioned something else that you were taking with it. I know I did not. Okay, I had some colors mentioning all these things, but I don't know what that was and you want to know. Okay, Neil, since you talked about Rick Riley, could you play Rick Riley stole my briefcase? Absolutely, sir. Thank you. Have a great day. What else you're taking? How do you occasional bury him in? Well, five, six, seven, and see. Most guys they put up an end in their prints, where he put it in the front, but in Ricky's case, back to him. Yeah. Well, I made him feel like, at home. 22 before noon at five, 60 WQM. It's Friday, you best, please. This great two does human race. Oh, Rick, you're a smuck. And go, Rick sucks.

Okay, I know you would know if anybody knew it. Why do he drive his race car on a weekend this year time? The brother of Tennessee Titans defensive and javon cursey won't get to watch Sunday Super Bowl. They might not even run the outcome of the game till six days later. Joseph cursey, who was serving seven and a half years for armed robbery, is in confining for a January one fight at the Soto Correctional Institution in Arcadia near Sarisota. Prison officials say the only way to learn the outcome of the game between Tennessee and St. Louis is if a guard be telling them. Joseph cursey was stripped of privileges for fighting with another inmate. He was moved from an open dorm to a cell and then isolated sex of the institution, which is not permitted to watch TV. Listen to the radio. We didn't use paper. He's a telephone until February five. Warden Linda Williams said officials will not make an exception. That's not there to the other inmates just because he's got a brother in a Super Bowl. She said, we can't say, well, let you watch and not let somebody else watch because they don't be having a brother in the big damn stupid bull. I scored Ireland. However your name is. So how do you like that? Five six seven, five sixty, palm five sixty on the AT&T line and all requests right in here. We're not mentioning the forward today once. We've succeeded almost two salots. We had one guy that dangerously started dancing around the edges of it and I had to send him on his way. He just don't get the message. He's just, uh, he's got a problem. You know, he's obsessed with this and they've gotten to him. We're trying to give him a little bit of a scape so we can clear his mind clear out his spectrum frames. Here's Virginia key. Hello. Yes sir. One first. I had to comment on that woman's last comment. You know, everybody likes to move down here and you can't live anywhere without the environment. If you don't take care of the environment eventually it's going to kick you in the floor. You can seem to consider about the gators and the manities. I'm going to report her to Carl Heis and you know, imagine if you're flying back from our state and you're landing in the swamp with all the, you know, what a front call who wants to land in the home state anyway. And what's the point? Let's you live there. And there's only about 10 white people lived down there. Well, I'm trying to get a green part of these one out with the, as far as his nose, they're not flying. With all those brothers that are down there, do you really want to land a plane? Have a like a woman's parent sucked into the turbine? No. No. Exactly. That's the point. I'm not going to post the put it. Secondly, uh, did you see the state of eating last night? Obviously. Do I see what? Just the state of the, of course. I watched the entire thing. I thought it was very good. I thought it was very good too. I was very, uh, very surprised and, and please, and happy that he ended things off that way. And I guess, including I want to request smoke to join for Bill and for Mr. Bush. For Mr. Bush?

Yes I do remember, Walter. I'm the one that talks about it, but I'm not interested in talking to you. Five six seven. Oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. You know two A.M. has a new guy that they are using as their foist talent. Every he's got a speech impediment. The list is the most annoying voice you've ever heard and he's on more and more commercial every day. Do you know the guy I'm talking to? You voice that's Tommy. Tommy's a great music great guy. He just can't he's got a speech impediment. That's all. The worst advertising voice ever. Well we don't care about that. We just want the money from the advertisers. We don't care about putting on a good spot. You know that. Why is this studio all full of reverb on everyone in this spot? Because somebody didn't close the pot or a smoke hit or something like that. I don't know. I mean, see now you're nitpicking. When I first came here a couple years ago, they used to play these crappy shouting distorted spots and I started screaming about it. And they looked at me like, boy, are you stirring up trouble? That's just the way we do things here. And now two years later, I say, okay, I don't care. They don't care why should I care. I thought maybe the point was to get my attention to get me upset so I keep listening. Right. That's it. Now you're on somebody called on Dammit. Have a great day, sir. Thank you. Yeah. Don't get stressed. It'll start up your IBM. That's right. Stay away from the stress. Five, six, seven. I mean, if they want to put blue blue on the air, I mean, like, let me more taste. If that's what they would put on the air, find with me a bit of no consequence. I want to say one thing, Jelda, even on his stab and jigs in the back, Jelda's right about that. Just, fumb it your way through. That's the QAMF in way. Want to buy you that stock? No. I'm sorry. I'm going to put to say that. No, word. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line here at one of the Broadcasting. Here's Miami. Hello. Hi. How are you doing, Neil? Okay, sir. I won't quit for you to miss talking. That guy at my father's, if he gets the money, I'd want him to build one down here. By where? The dolphin expressway. Okay. I missed that real bend. Yes, today I went to my local McDonald's. That done ordering the meals. Went for dessert. I asked for a cook using cream mixed floury. Okay. So, I'm sorry, we don't have cookies and ice cream. Well, what do you have? We have the M&M, the crunch and oreo's nail. She couldn't wonder why people kept asking for cookies and cream. Finally, got an English-speaking person there. You know, you're believable. Yeah. Well, good weekend there. And you too, sir. My chapter, those oreos, baby. They'll get you every time. What I hear, huh? Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on that's what Malcolm said on the young and the horny. Look after them oreos. They'd be going to get you. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T line. Out of town line, look like he had like what? A hang up or a crank or something under before we had any calls in everything? No. Was it a hang up? Oh, now they're just a line checker, no doubt. That's still working. They're working for audio mugwums over there. H-7-7-7-8-5, sixty, three, forty, five. Actually, it's probably one of the bee's leaves line checking. See if they've disconnected the damping, yet they're tenta paying for that line. Keep bastards. Here's cutlery of gelo. Color it. Let me say it again. Here's cutlery of gelo. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I used to be a manager at Godfather's Pizza's line giving me time in the mountain. Oh, right. Here we go. Now we're getting to the meat of the matter, which one? Where are we at? I was in Coral Gable to the time. Okay. What happened to it at the beginning was, Pills very came in and bought out Godfather's Pizza incorporated. Right. And they started making them do things like the D-10 piece of crap into that. No, not really. All right. Well, they made them do D-10 piece in the hand being slow. He's coming in at four o'clock in the morning. But I mean, Godfather's is the D-10 piece. I mean, that's what their product is. Well, remember they came out with a thicker. They had the original pizza, which was, you know, the one that came out with the original. They came out with D-10 piece. Okay. Then we had to come in at four o'clock in the morning, start baking its crap before we either even unlock the door. The employees were going home. Okay. So from the beginning, Bill's very came in. It started screwing everything out. But, in other words, the problem is the Pillsbury Doboy. He's a chigrin and wood tile. All right. And they made them spend like, you know, $150,000 a roll out of D-10 out of every store. You know, they made them spend a lot of money. There's been a lot of money on employees. You know, we're baking this stuff. And they didn't work. And then they started losing so much money after that. There's good up a good thing. Right. I mean, they came in. I mean, the original pizza with the best of Taco pizza. Absolutely. I mean, no shout over to this, the nominal. And then after that, a couple years after that, they sold this guy who has a restaurant down in Cullaridge. So basically, I think his family, you know, sit him down here to get him some to do. He took like what he had, like, 40 stores at the time and he ended up taking him down to one. You know, he closed all the other ones down. Even the ones that were making money. He just couldn't run the business at all. Yeah. And then he opened up this thing called Eddie Hux, Wings and things, and tried doing that. He opened up three and then closed those down. Good. So I mean, he was all shit. I went to a friend of mine. But hobby air. He was all shit. Window to a thinking with the early. Yeah. Yeah. The manager. He was windowed. He was pretty good. Winder dress. You know, hobby air? Yeah. I knew how he had. I know that. I was there from the beginning. He was a couple of stations and Wings knew there. I love the morgue. You know, right off the Dixie highway. Yeah. You used to come. I bring us some good stuff and peaches too. Really? Yeah. But wasn't his family that was, uh, no, I wasn't his family. He was a guy. Oh, thank God. Because that's all maybe he's behind bars. No, I know he'd be real busy. If that happens. No, yeah. The other was a Polish guy from Omaha. Oh, Polish. Now they had their headquarters in Omaha, right? All right. That's one of the, yeah. He bought the franchise from down here and eventually ended up moving down here. But a Polish guy, I think that's explained. Thanks. Yeah. Good. Does. All right. Thank you. Oh, I know how it is. Okay. There you go. Oh, this guy knew hobby air. Yeah. That was always my favorite hobby air five six seven that heavy on the pepperoni five six seven. Oh, five 60, five, five 60 on the 18 T wireless line. See, now, all new Cubans down here could be just like hobby air and Miguel. See, like with Miguel, he's like generic. I mean, you wouldn't know that he was Cuban. He could be like Columbian Venezuela and Puerto Rican, Guatemala, and he could be anything. He said, just looking pretty good. You know what I'm saying? He's hysterical though. What do you mean by that? He and George had some big time hysterical discussions in here about what about the Cubans and blocking the streets. And are you starting talking about that now? Okay. That's the thing we're going to be saying. I'm going to have a second time. You're talking about this, Peter. Yeah. hysterical Cuban. Another piece of professional Cuban, my good friend Miguel. Absolutely. I could hear that. I could straighten him out. Five six seven, oh five 60, pound five 60 on the 18 T wireless line as we're rolling along on an E free Friday here at QAM. The sports leader, sports radio five 60. QAF. It's Friday. You fast. Hey, four years yet, telling people have been known for a few things. Goblin, your shoes, making threatening phone calls when you're bound to check in a family restaurant and grabbing little puppies that come alive, turning in a little boy saying it's a double string on me. But recently, they've discovered a secret to nice, hard crunchy spaghetti. When you boil ordinary pasta, you get soft and mushy. But Barilla always cooks up al dante, which is Italian for both technically some kind of term. I don't know. But if your pasta is that al dante, then it's not Barilla. 40 years, I've been rolling my own pasta, but now with the advent of Barilla, I can then chill the don't even come over any more. I've been a tradition passed down from generation to generation. Made of the finest shot of your face. When I find it the suit, as I thought, a part of my family, I'll make a full cause of my cousin school in Gile and Mr. Bleh, or whatever his name is, will fight himself in a touch of a lake that's through a pasta. The choice I did on you Barilla. From an attempt, you don't have to get us in the mood for the last few days. I think we're already in the mood. Leave it to me to be the beginning to find out if this gun bothers us. Just as good in the course of so many years ago, am I going to remember if it's good all that you know, though, and I'm pretty sure it will be. Here's, you know, I hate to break the news to your folks, but this is twice this hour. We say we've got through two hours with no problem at all. Are we talking about that today? I said it's an e-free. We're not mentioning that name and I'm going to dump it. You will not be on the air. You don't have to get in the air. Are you going to be on the air? Yes. Stop. Stop. Enough. Not anymore. One more word. Okay. No. Find somebody else that will talk about that crap. Go on a phone in the yellow and he's all worked up about it. Talk to him. God. Is that incredible? I mean, I was rolling along no problem at all. And all of a sudden they just after two hours they can't control the water. I'm going to stick a brand in your pants and get out of here. Okay. Here's Miami. Hello. 560, 0560, pound five 60 on the AT&T. What is one? Two hours, not one. Fourteen minutes count them. Uno. Those. Trace. 560, 0560, pound five 60 on the AT&T. Where does the line here's the lady in high allele? Hello. Good afternoon. Yes, man. I have a question for you. Why did they take him cross the road? 560, 0560, pound five 60 on the AT&T. Where does the line here's what my or is, hello? Hey, Neil. Yeah. I'm not going to kiss you rectum, but I'd like to make a shameless request. Yeah. Could you play Stowing with Darnel? Okay. And could you do it before one of your breaks? Because I'm over here in their, on 1770, I got to listen to you on. And they always cut your bits off. Okay. I hate when they cut that off. Okay, proud you guys. Great job. Thank you. That's all. This is learning the spell with Darnel. I've been Darnel Jackson. And today we're going to spell the word consensus. Send it with me now. Concentrate. See you all in S-E-N-S-U-S. Now, let's use it in a sentence. Be careful what you say. Those cops, consensus, to jail. This is learning the spell with Darnel. I've been Darnel Jackson. I've been Darnel Jackson. I've been Darnel Jackson. This is learning the spell with Darnel. I've been Darnel Jackson. And today we're going to spell the word defend. Spell it with me now. Defend. D-E-S-E-N-S-E. Now, let's use it in a sentence. I room my new high-top climbing over defend. It was learned to spell with Darnel. I've been Darnel Jackson. All right, there's a little bonus for it. It's just a surprise to one. 12, 16, it's five, 60. I think what it is, a lot of these people are getting porked off. They were getting the free Godfather's pizza. They're not going to be at home too bad. At least I'm going to be your guinea pig. I'll let you know if it's good or bad or indifferent or in between. Then you go over it and spend your own heart and money. Here's Papano. Hello. Hey, and afternoon, you know. Yes, sir. Real quick question about the game one of the things. Did you really think the winter said was that blatant? I didn't. I saw the tape of it. I didn't see it long. I was too busy. I don't know what it is in this marketplace, but between the grandmother and husband and a two days. They were nothing about hockey in the morning. You would have thought that somebody was shot in the back of the head. And it was left and laid to bed. I mean, I just don't understand where. I mean, it was a good physical game. And maybe it was. It's like that many of the times that those two teams. Yeah. And then the bottom line is that's Philadelphia won the game. That bad panther defense of first period allowed them three goals. Not of which should have happened. And it's quite a burden playing standing on a setting plane. Great. the game so all these people that want to either talk about air fris dirty and right is a more well-great and then we have all those great fights it's all window dressing and mean nothing well you know I'm glad there's an actual hockey voice that doesn't they're talking about here down here and I appreciate it and thank very much but too and then like I said before there is a one panter fan with a brain with a brain that is who wouldn't want air fris on our team. Oh he's so dirty well you know that's just the way it goes that's the price of peanuts in the big city you're gonna go out to like Kimbo campers says you want to play with a big boys you can't go out there and cry and be a bunch of pussy's here's a mobile and del Rey B chill out. Yeah yeah yeah yeah no not you aren't going to. Oh I'm already taking down but. You have to hurry. Hey that's not just that first you should be happy to know I'm picking up my gun I'm trading in my fun for a flight jacket. Yeah. Get the gun out of the house finally but that's not like old. Oh and congratulations on the shaky speech though. I mean Godfather. Yeah. Yeah I'm getting ready to say it's not in shaky. Now I can't talk about phone. 560 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 50 on the 18 T line can see pretty soon we're going to be going to music and then we're going to enjoy our pizza and pizza okay because these people are out of material you able to do it for two hours today and I applaud you for that I commend the audience they were doing an e-free day today and they we actually found some other things is not a lot going on because I just super bowl which we want to talk about it all no except for go Titans. But now you're pretty much the well has run dry because maybe the media's got a point here maybe you're just as one dimensional as your local TV channels I think that you are because speaking for myself which is the only person I can speak for I don't want to hear no more about that crap two day and since that hearing is on the six to March that gives us all the month of February and a couple more days in January like this weekend where quite frankly I prefer not to hear any more about it. There's nothing to talk about. There's nothing more to say about it. Other than enough enough of the crap. Here's a mobile interpreter hello. You know what's going on? Yes sir. If you have a charge of people for calling here something. That make a donation to the station. Listen got for the pizza I had it about two months ago and it was pretty average. I have a region. I thought so yeah. Good pizza on here is about a common as a rational Cuban. So I'm not a material. Okay. Name is Anlacaset the audience is Adam material. Pretty perceptive. Pretty perceptive.

Not want to talk about that. F**k on the wrist boring crap that nobody would have brainwashed you anymore, but let's get with it. Let's get a life here today. And the good thing is the way actually had a few calls about that panther game last night. Boy, that's not even a lot more full of shmits. Oh, that Eric is so dirty. What are we going to do? We sell dirty. Put trouble a little bit. That's what I say. You're going to play with a big boy. You got a butcher up. Isn't that the panther's, I mean the leaps beat the play off last year? Oh yeah. Dirty or not? Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, I need a long time listener. I want to appreciate your work on the radio. Oh, this question. This lady who won the 35 million in Vegas, does she get a lump something out or is that a very big pot? I only paid over 20 years, which she couldn't live that long. Just like the lottery. Right.

Where were you thinking goes? I've heard of payouts that if he dies, you know, sorry. No. I'll, I'll, I'll assume it. I mean, they can't do that. Can they do that? I don't know. Quite frankly, I don't care. She's no begging. I'm not related to her. So who gives a crap? Some 500 year old bitch goes there. Spend 27 bucks in a slot machine. That's only nine pulls and wins the megabucks. You actually have a lot of people who are truly two weekends ago when I was out there. We're trying desperately to win. It was only 32 million in a barclosetal for that. It comes out of a show in the desert. Pops and, you know, nine pulls and all of a sudden, but I'm being better bang. And they showed the machine the thing was going off and there's this three megabucks symbols on the pay line. And I'm just muddling and screaming and puking my guts out of this old bag. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. You know, yes sir. Good friend of mine is to progress press secretary. And I'm trying to record the bill Clinton. I'm spoof you have.

Right in your hand. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. On the AT&T Wireless line. I'm depressed what you told me about Miguel. I'm really psychotic about that. These are professional historical Cuban. It spends a lot of time going. I'm going to do the loose in him up a little bit. Here's four Myers. Hello. Four Myers. Long gone. Thank you very much. Here's a mobile in the summer. Hello. Okay. Also gone. This is, we can, this would be perfect timing because we'll be out of calls in the fool of the year. You're going to put the music on. Great. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60 on the AT&T Wireless line. See, this is the proof in the pudding. I'm on this end again. Doing an award winning revolutionary great idea of vending any of this potterist talk about. You know what? The only problem is these people are got no guide to the material. No material. I'm embarrassed. Like I thought I was proud there for a couple of hours. But I'm humiliating and degraded again to be working this up. Bum fork town. God. I would, I would think that people would be kissing my ass. Just to give them some release. Are we leave? And escape. And a waste is from this swill. Is that the case? No. No. They're just abandoned. You every time you try to do something good, give an alternative. They just abandoned you. Oh, no. We want to talk about that. I'm not, well, no. The answer is still no. Absolutely. Possitively. No. 26 after 12 at 5. 16 WCW. In the end, it's tough. Oh, no. Oh, no. Right here. A sport radio, my 60 KAM. Oh, no. I was sports fans. I love sports. I eat sports, bring sports, sleep on sports. And listen to sports radio all the time. But thank you for being inside the cake. I love sports. And now we've got the super bowl of camera. And I'm really getting hyped up with all this media stuff to do. And like, I like to follow along. Because I like to see what's happening. And we're going to do like, go like to my friends house. We're at a 60 inch screen. And we're going to drink like free. And then we're going to have teams if you know. And I'm going to take off my shirt. It's a good day. It's a good day to game. Like you see people do do it like you super bowl. And I'm going to make my arms go like this and go. There's that up. I'm going to do that. You all you know that. You know that. That means the shit. And you know, sports is really all about my life. Because I love talking about sports. Talking about sports with my buddies and stuff. You know, because you know, some of them they got wives and girlfriends. Stuff and that. I have to not have to chance to have one of them. Oh, sure. When I was my buddies, I talked about getting the eight old. So it's a total of us had one of those. I've got it. But the mainly sports forces, what I know. That's why I thought about sports all the time. And I go home. So I got really my efficiencies of hot plate. And I didn't bed and drop cracker crumbs in my underwear. And that's all my life pretty much consists of outside of sports. It was for a sign of no. I had my life. But. Well. But that's that. But that's that. Sign up. No PD. Maybe 1231 at 560 WQM 560 5050 5060 pound five 60 on the AT&T. Right. Right. Right. For hours of escape from this grotesque craft is swill. This shmit. Here's for a lovely day. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. Bless you for the. Free Friday. Uh-huh. Thank you. And the prices right. Yes, sir. Like to set your straight. You should pardon the expression. I'm a lady who won the 35 mil. Right. She is a very hot middle aged blonde cocktail. Wait. Oh, really? I'm a little bang. No, she was on good morning America this morning. All right. Now I feel better. And you know, if I was traveling on a business trip and they get she would definitely do. No, no, no, no, she's going to be my long enough to collect the money. There you go. Well, she, she and she wasn't a one shot or she went every week and put in $21. Yeah. And half of it with her. Well, he put in $27. Half of it with somebody all. No, no, this time she put in six extra. And that's why she wanted. And she split it every week with her boyfriend. Right. And she's giving him half the money. Well, isn't that sweet. All right. Thank you. I feel much better. Thank you. See, that's good. I mean, nothing really makes any difference. But it's just the idea of some old 90 year old bag that's going to croak in about two months, when in 35 million while all those living and breathing beautiful people about their and take us that would have been depressing. So are we glad that some beautiful young brought one instead of us? No, no, we want it. No, I don't care how the love she was or a fantastic class. I wouldn't care if it was like Ray Whitney's twin brother who won. I don't care what they look like. I want to God damn money. I'm not that I'm greedy. Am I? Oh, why not? Why is it always got to be somebody else? See, that this is the philosophy when you buy the lottery ticket or you go to one of those machines with a gigantic progressive jackpot. You think in your, but they've got your brain washed into believing somebody's going to win it. So why not me? You know what I'm talking about? Somebody's got to win it. There will be a winner eventually sooner or later. So why not not me? It could be just as well. Me is anybody else couldn't it? No, no, not really. But you think that they've got you conditioned to believe in that. And that's why you keep punching in there and punching and punching. What are the, one of the mega, whatever that mega box jackpot thing? I played it in that one like 300 bucks on it. And I got up and I walked away and I'm watching and I was some guy gets on it and hit like four spins later or a thousand eighty bucks. What are you doing watching the slot machine you just left? You're supposed to run as fast. Well, no, I was playing the quarter wheel of fortune in there and it was right around a quarter from this. So I just thought out a curiosity since this, oh no, in fact, actually I was playing the one on the end. I went back and played again. And this guy had just sat down about his fourth or fifth pull. He was pulling it and he hit like, you know, triple triple something. And he didn't even know what it was. And I looked around with things. I'm like, is that I said, thousand eighty bucks. And his friend came over and said, oh, good. Now you're here. Even for the day. Now you're going to have to be in such a bad mood, which maybe could a little bit better. And I thought, oh, the other words, music. But why did I feel better? In other words, I had two or three hundred credits on there. And I'm playing for thirty two million dollar jackpot. That's supposed to be the idea is getting all those credits to have more pulls when it dot pull it out. But I've learned my lesson because feeding a machine, giving it money back. If I could have all of my money right now that I've given back that I was ahead over the years, I wouldn't be here right now. I'd be long gone. Don't. That's just dumb. It's just like if you find a hot machine and this is another example. Getting up and walking away. If it's loose, it's loose. If she's loose, she's loose. Like this cocktail waitress. Maybe Freda was bangler and her friends to what it's time. Here's Paupema Pai and hello. Yes, if that guy's called my friend or she is a cocktail waitress. Oh, thank God. Do we still have another now that's, no, no, not really. She gives her to her boyfriend and the head. She's going to share with her family. She comes from the family of eight kids. There's an ad nice. And you know, I lived there for six years and a great. Really? Yeah. My wife dragged me back to a cemetery building. Oh, boy. But I think I'm going back soon. I can't take it. I lived in this joint for 30 years. It's a toilet. And I've got to go back. I can't take this place. Yeah, but how did you live out there that long without the loop? Oh, I worked in the casino. I worked at the Alaska building. There you go. There you go. I worked at the Aladdin 40 blue it up. Right. And the weapon, the vanish, I was just shift-balls in the poker room at the Aladdin. You know, the only good thing about that all the Aladdin was the head of a really good before. The Aladdin was the best hotel in the world, but they didn't take care of it. And that's why they had a blow or something. The water. The water. The water was breaking up. So they had a, eventually, blown it up. They were going to re-bottle it. And they changed their mind. So they're building a new one now. Oh, good. Yeah. They finished April. He finished. Yeah. I saw the beginnings when I was at the. I already have my. Great. Excellent. I'll see you there. Thanks. See, there's a guy that went to Vegas and lived there for six years and came back here and said, Oh, I just think bad move. I mean, you know, when you, you can smell the excitement here, can't I? Or it's a philosophy bags. I thought I was the excitement I was smelling. We all want too much excitement, who went a nice and quiet. The only excitement out there is. A occasional demonstration and ride and protest, but other than that, let's keep it nice and quiet. You know, and the sounds, the only other excitement here, they're sounds of the car smashing into each other from all the people out there, driving, we have no business with other license and a box of cracker checks. You know what I'm talking about. That's your excitement. 23 before one. Any minute now they're going to be bringing in that pizza boy. I don't know what should I do. Should I maybe I'll watch you have a piece and see if it's really good. Huh? And if you're gagging on it. America loves to watch boobs and button-pointing. Here's. On the football, they have to be gagged. They told me to keep it rough. They got a very big thigh because his thigh didn't really fall from the ground. They didn't do anything. I'll look at you. And have to firm with you. You say always where I will do. Don't you tell it's all up to tag me up with me. I hate to pay your taxes and I want to go around. So, you've been for the Altos ground. We need it and it's all gone. If you never leave the channel so long, you can open every sports range of them. Then I'm a bad individual. They do it like that. Now if you can catch the ball or rub with the ball, with race and murder, they all run. As long as they can, it's the beat you. It's set out slump and skiing. In games, you get's running on as they're making money. They're going to strike you in a way. You need to pay your taxes and I'm going to blow them down. Roll the ramp or be on the ground. Be prepared and let them come. Be prepared and let them come. Be prepared and let them come. Be prepared and let them come. Be prepared and let them come. All right, 17-4-1. You can feel the smell of cancer. That's a great godfather's pizza on the way. It's almost here. It's almost here. We hope that it'll be pretty soon. We're getting real psychotic about it. 5-6-705-60, pound-5-60 on the AT&T. Where's the slime? Here's North Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. You have an E-3 Friday, huh? 5-6-705-60, pound-5-60 on the AT&T. Where's the slime? Out of townline, 877-785-6345. 877-785-any-i-l. Got that? That's how we spoke of it here. In English. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, do you read on the sports paper? About my health. About my health. About my sports. Yeah, that's the kind of another right-wing-ass-hole congress guy, yeah. I think one of those could be the campaign manager. That's what he heard about. Okay, thanks for your news. Yeah, Tom Osborn. He's not a football coach, and now he's never been another guy. Never met a criminal he didn't like. So he's got a run for congress now. Maybe he gave a special dispensation. He can partner all of those ex-criminals that play for Nebraska. Oh, and by the way, this article by Anna Quinlan and Newsweek. She talks about my ties and the... What's the name worth talking about? Is it... No. Football players, Tito Wooten was signed with $8 million deal when New York Giants two years ago. Less than a month after a girlfriend would accuse him of beating a rough committed suicide in his garage. His past history had included two college expulsions and five arrests three for violence against women. Wooten was cut last month by the Indianapolis Colts. Let's say a prayer that he's not dating. Christian Peter seems to have majored at the University of Nebraska in football, drinking in sex crime. Oh! Speaking of Tom Osborne, he too was signed by the Giants. Although during college he had pleaded no contest to one charge as sexual assault served 10 days on a subsequent charge. That was accused of twice raping a freshman woman with whom he eventually settled a civil suit. The Giants staff psychologists has said that Peter is clean up his act and that his behavior was influenced by alcoholism and attention deficit disorder will see how the AAADD defense works for less well-placed sex criminals. Less to be fooled by the argument that this is all merely a reflection of our six society, there was this. Jeff Bennett, who has written two books about athletes in violence to the survey of 10 schools, which found that while athletes made up 3% of the population, they were responsible for nearly 20% of the reported sexual assault. Let me say it again. Athletes make up 3% of the population, but they're responsible for nearly 20% of the reported sexual assaults. John Rocker must suspect that he would have gotten more of a break-up than shot off his big stupid mouth. What a great article. My school in Anna Quinlan and the Newsweek magazine on the back-in-side page this week. Here's Del Rey B. Hello. Yes, sir. Del Rey. Sounds like you. Okay. Long time, long time. All right. Listen, that woman that won the 35 mil. Yeah. She's a young lady. She's not even in the late 30s. That's what we could just had three calls about that, right? Oh, you did? Uh-huh. Cocktail waitress. You're right. Very attractive. You'd have to make a door for that. Yeah, so what do you go about all the way to? You must look at his money. Some mother. What is it? The mother of the year. Somebody gave us some bad information. That's all you know how that goes. Yeah. Somebody gave us some of the BS. Okay. Thanks. Somebody put the BS into our IBS. Into our. I don't know. I don't know. BS. 560560, 560, 560 on the AT&T line. Starting a little bit nervous about it. You give me a good direction. It's not to get here. Impackable. Impackable direct phone number to call if he gets lost. In case he gets lost. Not that we want to be pushy or anything like that. Do we want to be pushing? Uh-huh. But just that it sounds. It really sounds to go to be true. You know, it's like you can't go back like I was talking about the other day. Try to go back to Detroit. No, your favorite restaurants are closed down. And try to go back to Rochester and Donna Bobbin is in the same as it used to be. And no matter where you try to go back, you're never the same. No. Go back to Boston. It's Prince spaghetti. How's still there? No. All you people from New England boy are the old parts like me. If you remember the Prince spaghetti house, it was a chain in Boston. That was the best. The best. The menu would be like just like on a spaghetti page. You're like 600 different kinds of spaghetti with sausage with meatballs with the peppers. With this, with a, oh man was that a good place. So when you had been Boston in those days, every day was Prince spaghetti day. Which is why I gained about 6,000 pounds there. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Miel. Yes, sir. Yeah, I want to be real quick because I know you got a lot of calls. You only got all that garbage. I want to write to the point. I got a double shot of broke a brand request.

Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, my rose to George Bush. Oh, there's a day day. They sent him to a three-through tree, where the genu-plexed and terrain.

Father, who to? Hey, then. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, my rose to a man. George Bush said that his nose is clean and never puts a face in it. Has he runnin' for the wide house, so he just can't his men? Stone, drums, and that's not all even down the view, Steve Ball. He's a common genie, drunk with you, he even dropped some master clues. Why won't George Bush come out and simply say he did it? He'd be free, but the press would shut their mouth. But it's not he got them to say. He did more than watch your think. But he watched it down the city. And he prefer cocaine to hush. As the question that he does. And he makes his point much clearer. Like a razor on a mirror. But he wants the two beys. He's ready to do anything. George Bush said that his nose is clean and never put a face in it. Can't he runnin' for the wide house? He just can't his men. George he's clean. George he's clean. Well, if you want it 560 WQAM on an E-free Friday, I'd like to. Got to feel good about this. Feel like I've done something positive and useful in my life today. Here's a fact.

Now, wouldn't you think that our local channels here were getting a lot higher ratings instead of all this e-crap that they're putting on every day? Yeah, but I don't know who was a separate baby with a lot of people. Who else would you want to see strip on? I'm not talking about them. They'd have to bring in some real people. Yeah.

I mean, Princess Diana. That would be a close second. But I would say that this is already passed that. Left it standing in the awake of it to stereo. This terms of overkill. Not even close. Diana. Here's Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I think the guy you called and he's bringing the pizzas. Yeah. Is the same guy who's bringing George the Pokemon cards? Oh, it could be.

That's kind of just like a lot of those live spots that we have from certain shows on a station on time. If they like a piece together. So, hey, I'm 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, what's up, Uncle Nielsen? Yes, sir. Listen, you know that one of your advertisers, your budget rental car, advertisers, the dude answers the phone. He's named Paul Smith. I'm just a Smith, just one. I hear that. Well, he's thinking of Schmidt. I was reading in the paper today. I'm a little bit more lovely Harold than the people section about Calcy Grammar takes on the taboo cause for IBF. For sure. Yeah, I saw that. Yeah, and it says, I've got a Schmidt problem. Apparently, it's Gophen got the Schmidt problem. It must be that way he drives something like that. Right. But yeah, I just thought I'd tell you that a new spokesperson for your Schmidt. No, there was something he was on TV this morning, given a song of an answer about the IBF. Oh, feeding some BF. Yeah, he needs to remove the BF. That's what he needs to do about the account. Do me a favor, man. Hey, let's request for the Schmidt play a mom-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo. Number two, you got it. All right, buddy. Okay. Mom-bo-bo, number two, that couldn't be that vulgar Brian. That's a good answer. Oh, right. The way I move around, when I go to, I call it the mom-bo-bo, and the mom-bo-bo-bo, and the mom-bo-bo-bo-bo-bo. I'm the toiletsy, nice to get to the bathroom. To the mom-bo-bo-bo-bo, the radio plays. So, knowing how to hold it, and I'm all through the room. There's your corner, please. I got the toiletsy, too. It's in a bit of a safe, but it's all I need. So, I'd like to make my hiding, nice and cheap. Let them. I don't have to push, guys. It's good to roll when a movement side to side, not the toilet pose. I never have to spray it, it's a cloud hole. It looks a little like the 2-0. I'd wait to the left and wait to the right. Who's watching the TV machine, and I'll tell you why. Not only are you burning, calories, and you never ever get a big red ring. That's why, with that guy, we can't do the exercise, and have enough fun when they get the bomb, we'll move it up or two. Hey, let me out of the van. I'm doing the man, but, oh, come on, no, it's a little bit of a whirling head. Shut up, stop it. Get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it. I don't care, I'll get out. 103 and 560WQM, oh man, I feel like I've gained a lot of weight. I feel like I've gained 20 years of my life for the E. Free Friday here today. What a great idea. Nice going, Neil. Thank you. Neil, come on. Well, I can say, you gotta have a sense for the timing. There's a time when you go with a flow, and there's another time when you give it a rest. You put it back in its place, you let it breathe a little bit, and you give it a little bit of a rest. And do we need a rest or what? 560, 0560, pound 560. What is that that you got on your head? That'd be bad. Well, that's the, the funky cap, plus the whiskey cap on top. That OJ left when he was hanging out here with Roy. And Sam, isn't it great? It's a lovely thing. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hello. Yes, sir? Um, this is Leo. Sounds like me. What's going on? Uh, I just want to say it's great to live in a free country like America. Uh, you know, you have a freedom to turn to V.A. Whenever you please. Right. So I think a lot of people should take that advice and just turn to God. And to be up whenever they hear something about E. Oh, okay. Oh, he scared me. I'm sorry. My fingers really to you. Sorry about that. I thought he was going to say, uh, that, you know, I protected it in my cover design. So to speak. 560, 0560, pound 560, on the AT&T, why the slant. That out of time, I made a couple of calls for Mars. Did I not to exciting? I mean, if 50 billion people over here have no material. Why should we expect, you know, a bunch of poor bastard's over there to have some material. Do we expect them? No. Oh, Jim. Plus, they're getting ready for the big rallies this weekend over there. You know how that is? They got all their pointy hats on everything over there in four miles. That's just a bunch of rumors. There's no red and extra whatever it is. Uh-huh. Come on. Let's do, um, Jupiter. Hello. Neil, so I think you're going to have a great weekend. I am. It's so great today, man. I feel great. Hey, dude. I haven't just got father's pizza. It'll maybe have a relapse, you know? I don't want to look at the, uh, bad case of the, uh, mits again. Did it get there? No, no, no, no, no, the guy's always weighs almost clear. You can almost help me. I hope we wouldn't post them at there. Did, um, did you, there's a woman behind you at the hockey in the Thursday game? Have you ever seen her ever before? Uh, right behind you. I didn't notice. I didn't think I'm figuring you wouldn't, but, um, she wasn't. Oh, you really? Well, no, no, no. Well, to me she was. I ended up an upper deck with the knackers. So I didn't know if you first heard of you, you should always sat there and ask. I mean, it's kind of hard when somebody's seeing directly behind you, like to turn around and stare at them, you know, which. At least was talking about, she must not be giving her hard time or something. So I said, you didn't notice her, but no, you see, you see, don't you use up the game? Uh, not tonight. Doug McLean? Yeah, he was up in the sky up in, uh, where the press, uh, the press guy's are with, um, talking to, uh, the spokesman. I wish I would have known that. I'd have been up there giving some much mid about, uh, Marty Strockett. I would have. Yeah, um, that was, that game. Could you ever, have you ever felt like that when you up the game like the dirty game? No, I, I, I didn't, I didn't, let me just tell you. I didn't leave. We ran out. I mean, not, not just to be to crowd because that's easy, but I mean, I did, I ran out with a feeling of such nausea and such gross test. Uh, it's an inexplicable, uh, psychosis. I can't even describe it. I would just, I would just sit. I was with, yeah. Did you see pop and try and explain it before the game last night? I don't know if you watch sports, uh, the, uh, the river broadcast, but pop and spend five minutes. Oh, yeah, I did see that and he was sucking around and rationalizing and covering up. Who the hell was he talking to last night? I was like, it was a, it was a stupid play. I mean, one of the players on our last night and he was trying to recover up for Spayla and how bad he felt and all this other craft. And then of course, when Spayla made the nice past and spring bring free on a break away and begin to be in the game. Oh, I feel so good for Spayla and of course, he, I just can speak to his, he missed the fact that Spayla screen out of her and so we couldn't stop but turn out to be the winning goal in the game by Rekie. I may just, he's just an idiot. I know, and I love Robbie, but Bobby, but he's still, but he's, you know, this sometimes he just doesn't. Yeah, I don't what he's think of. Well, I know they all talk about him being in great offensive defense. But I would like to see as have as a defensive defense field and defensive defense middle can play defense. We're trying to die in every time Spayla smacked some passion from his shin guards and went back the other way. I mean, if he's the depth offense of them, I had his offense. Yeah, he's a player. It was pretty offensive. We have a great taster. Again, a little panther talk going here now. I'm feeling more and I feel that Edmonton game. We might pack that joint about 17,000. Maybe we'll say, come on. Let's get out there. Oh, those panthers. Oh, that's right. They lost two on a wrong. Sorry. It doesn't make any difference. They don't even know that they lost a two on a roll. These bandwagon jepers. They're going to be playing a real girl team to run. I didn't pretty excited Edmonton. Aren't they exciting? I mean, they have no defense. And generally, they want to have squirn only one or two goals. Again, we'll want to have squirn five or six. I think tomorrow night's. And I'm going to kick some very serious. And as in Brewery and Whitney and Whitney and Brewery and Victor too. Don't forget about good old Victor. Nice going, Victor. Come back, guy at the year, Victor cries a lot. Nice going, sweetheart. And we've got to get some big, big fat ass. Here's the lady in Miami, hello. Lady in Miami. Hello. Yes, man. Would you be kind enough to please give me the names of the herbs that you discussed yesterday? No. No. 560560. What do you look at me for? I mean, I don't know what you're talking about. There was some guy called in with some Google eyes and the boy queue. So I don't have any idea what it was. No. That's it done. I have blu-lips. 560560. I am a bastard. Make no mistake about that. That's the way I'm sorry, man. But really, in all honesty, it's a radio show. Okay. This isn't a doctor's show. I have no idea what they weren't. I don't want to know. The worst thing that could ever happen is that we start going back to that crap. You're a f***. Amen. That's our hockey ball for football. Marlins baseball and now the Miami Hurricanes do. Sports radio 560QAM. Get worse than a narchond in the basket. Wow, your fat ass is really comfortable. Wow, your fat ass is doing wonders for my bad bag. Want to do something useful with your fat ass? I can sleep on your fat ass all day. Then why not put it to use? You don't mind if my girlfriend sits on your fat ass too, do you? As one of America's newest app cushions. Put your fat ass to use for the airline. And turn a code seat into comfort class. This is great by letting people sit on your fat ass. You'll be helping to improve people's days on the bus at the movie theater, even at the park. Mommy, your son's on this fat ass with me. Put your fat ass to work today. Receive hourly wages, health benefit and host. Call now and be proud to be a fat ass. Wow, the market's ticket a big nurse met today. I'll tell you that that was down 203 points and an n-zx down 143. I would either call my broker right now and tell everything like crazy or just blow my brains out. One or the other. Okay, so let's get back to much music on a TV. No, thank you. Get away from that to depressing stuff. 560, 560, 560 is the pizza here yet from, No, gone, gone, gone. No, no. Now I'm starting to get a little bit nervous. Here's a mobile and Western. Hello. Hi, I love you. How you doing? Pretty good. I have a question for you. Why does that big fat bulldog? No, I need to live in a million dollars. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless line. Out of time line is 877, 785, 6345. 875. He can't precariously close to the. He were there and I had to listen him on his way. Send him packing. He's already packing. He's starting to get a little nervous about this pizza situation here because I got news for you to a clock. A big hot shot like me is not going to sit around wait for it. I'm lying. I mean, this is something exciting. This doesn't have it every day that somebody from a godfather comes in the brings us good stuff. Probably it's probably just a sham. Here's a mobile and candle. Hello. Good afternoon. Yes, sir. The do happen to hear after the union of the state of the union address. Yes, they are the right wing. Of course, now I'm not going to watch that bitch. No, no, no, no. How would they? I'm talking about on the news. What they did to make the gift him a presence. He mistraced and decided to open up the. All the John thing again went to the spring court of Arkansas. Yeah. So he can answer charges of obstruction of justice. And if he is found guilty, he is this large. These people can't leave him alone. No, no, that's why it's so amazing that he's had done this well because I mean, and if you notice during the speech last night, 99% of the time, talk about partisan. Maybe only one or two times when a Republican applauded and stood up. And then almost all the time, it was so, so obvious on one side, all of the Democrats are standing in the applauding and the generals and all these other. And then they're the people are sitting on their seat. And one of the times when they did stand up, I think what he mentioned to farmers, here's that asshole Pete D'Metachi from the Mexico. And he's, you notice he's motioning the guys around. Okay, we can stand up now. It's okay. Like he's orchestrating as opposed to what they really believe are not. They do happen to see Tom delay a couple of times. I wouldn't watch him. I would, I would puked my gut. He looks like a fashist. What do you mean look like? Have a great day, sir. God bless America. Just relax. Okay. It's a police state that's not going to change. You're going to change? No. Okay. Leave back that. Oh, she's, watch yourself. 5, 6, 70, 5, 60. It's easy to get lulled back in and that again. The fact that what we're going to do is take the last half hour and just have Miguel come and you're making a passionate plea on behalf of. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Happy E.F. And say me. Thank you for giving us a place to, what the Schmidt can't get us to hide, you know? No one can say you ain't an original.

And as soon as they hear bowel, they think, guys, of that, which that can be and sometimes is a part of this whole syndrome. But is that all that is? No. No. It's like kishki. It's intestines.

Cause I've been coming back. No. One night's been at 5.60W to kill him. We're getting a little bit concerned. Is that pizza from Godfather's here yet? No. We don't know. Godfather. I think this thing is coming from odd fathers. Maybe from odd jobs. Or something like that. Because just ain't here yet. We're going to get a little bit concerned. 5. 6. 705. 60. 5. 60. On the AT. I mean, that's the big tease. And if anybody knows about the big tease, you're talking to him. I know all about it. Here's the mobile info. Waterdale. Hello. Yes, sir. I just like to say thank you to the wizard and Paul. They were exciting to watch last night. We'll see if he was over the first minute in the last minute. And after that, go watch something else. Which I did. Well, it was funny. Anyway, I'll head off the sense, too, for not taking any crap. Thanks. Thanks. Thanks for that. Yeah. Well, I know. It's good to watch. After suffering through last year. And nobody doing anything after cheap hits. It's like watching the team this year stand up for him. Yeah. This will go big. Yeah.

Here's a call from the Hampshire. Hello? Sir. I need a high-zege on. Great. I just got in today. So I don't know this aspect of the speed last night was covered or not. But we're putting seem to make such an effort to, you know, the whole bipartisan deal is left or he wants to leave. Right. I guess he went up. Something we saw gas. Well, just seem to make such an effort to make all these tax cuts, you know, which is such a stable issue with the Republicans. And just tax-registered tax-to-tax. Yeah. And if you notice, but every time they showed the wide pan of the entire, the entire game, I just mentioned that it was like completely split down a line. There was almost never one Republican standing and there was no, there were no while people on either side sitting. Right. Exactly. And you'd figure that at least some of the time they stand up even with those issues. Maybe a couple of times. In fact, even made the joke about trying to even out the AC saw, you know, early in the speech, you made their comment. But they sat there with a glum look on their post. And that's the way it's been marching in the beginning. I mean, they hate him like poison. Right. Exactly. And one that really got to move when he mentioned making a guessing the equal pay act, make sure men and women are paid the same in the day. All, I mean, even does hazard to state. Said he didn't, and I thought, I was pretty pretty indicative of how unforgiving and how hard line they are. On yielding, then, and it's going to be really great when Democrats when both houses are a congressman, so you're going to be fantastic. Or you can, we should throw fireworks and then happen. Absolutely. All right. Nice talking to you, Neil. Have a great day, pal. So, half sure they have that big primary up there on Tuesday, right? Oh, all those crusty new hamster people all 10 of them.

Here's a call on the cables. Hello. Oh, hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm wearing the collar and I'll make a request from my wife. She hadn't heard my ass. Did you do that for me? My ass? Yes. Oh, my ass. Is that what it's called? What is it called? Why two K something? Oh, why two K my ass? All right. Thank you, sir. Nice going, Jo. How do you like that? George saved our why two KS. Thank you for attending today's conference on how to deal with the why two K problems. I would like to announce the development of a new software system, which will be year 2000 compliant. This program is known as millennia year application software system or my ass. Next Monday there will be a meeting in which I will show my ass everyone. We will hold demonstrations throughout the month so that all employees will have an opportunity to get a good look at my ass. We have not addressed networking aspects yet, so currently only one person at a time can be a good one. The first person at a time can use my ass. This restriction will be removed after my ass expands. Last week my secretary said to me, I'm a little nervous. I never put anything in my ass before. I helped her through the first time and after word she admitted that it was relatively painless. And she was actually looking forward to doing it again. And was even ready to kiss my ass. As you begin using the program, feel free to put anything you want in my ass. As my ass grows larger, we envision a time when it will be commonplace for supervisor to hand work to an employee and say, here. Stick this in my ass. It will be a great day when we need data quickly. And our employees can respond here it is. I just pulled it out of my ass. All right. Thank you. 1, 2, 4, 5, 60, WQM, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

Let's, I think we have to separate the men from the going. Here's what we have to do. The things that we care about, if we can find any down here. But if things that we care about, that's what we'll talk about. The things that a bunch of other people who are one dimensional care about, let's then be one dimensional. Because I say, Oh, to that craft. Something major and exciting happened. I'll be more than delighted to do, you know, get hysterical for five minutes. But other than that, the answer is still. No. Give us a rest. Give us a rest. Give us a, and I love the guy. Somebody facts me a bunch of emails he had back in fourth with somebody a channel for news. And he was complaining about the fact that we're talking about. So damn much and inundating it with us. And the guy, uh, facts is back from channel for news. He says, Oh, well, every time we put on the ear, a lot of people tune in. So you could put a bunch of naked beautiful people on there. Haven't sex. I'm channeled for and a lot more people would tune in than when you put. Fuck crap on there. And quite frankly, I've much rather watched a lot of beautiful young. A naked people haven't sexed and fuck crap. So please don't give us a song to dance about how we all want to see. Fuck we don't. Pilech myth. 26 after one is five, 60 WQM.

He was printing his body, he accompanied in a bay. And he could be in a bay. No care, no care, no care, no care. And Lord push you back like he was a day. Well, hello, it was a day to stay. You're a greener, gorgeous, lovely, lovely, lovely. He was the white house, he'd be the army. Like a princess, a child. So he can't even be the one, he'd be the one, like a prince, or a child, or a prince. He's a black house, a child. How that's the way it's called, and the door comes open, he's a night in today.

No, I'll wait till 2 o'clock, that would be unfair, you know? And the best part of it is that our buddy, what is his name, the sky, or do you tell us his name? He didn't say, but I think it's JR. JR, because the guy on the phone line when I spoke. He said, are good to me, go JR here. He brought in with Robert Gloves, no less. And he put on the lettuce and the other cheese that goes on top, and the other and the tomatoes and stuff. And so it'll be perfect in the microwave, because it'll melt all that stuff. On to the other, which is the whole concept of Godfather's anyway. And let me a little menu here. And he brought you, what is the other stuff there? Like garlic, garlic stuff with pepperoni and cheese inside. Like little calzones, but more like garlic stuff. Tests express, you got your head's gas station right there by a 595 and Ditty Road Station, and a touch true right on the asset of it is a Godfather's baby. So you'll have to tune in the Monday and find out if we're still alive and it was really good. And if it messed up with my ideas too much, which I'd done. On the other hand, you shouldn't do that too bad. But out. Here's Miami, hello. Hello, Neo. Yes, sir. Is anybody up here to talk to you before about the woman who won the 35 million out of Vegas? Yeah, about the cocktail waitress who's not as old and like we thought. Yeah, because I heard in the car and then I got a few calls about that. Okay, just want to update you on that. And also think about the Kelsey Grammar with the, or the IBS we had two calls on it. Okay. And have a great weekend. You too. Thanks. Well, they're way ahead of him, but his intentions are good. He was okay, right? Oh, sorry. We've almost made it through four. And I did have to dump a couple of calls because some people out there can't keep it in their pants. They can't control themselves. Who wanted to flip the. He worked in their run us today and started hot kind of trying to come up. You know, rehashing the obvious. Do we want to do that? Oh, no. Absolutely positively. No. We won't do it. But this is this has been. I feel spectacular. Of course, once I started eating this pizza, you know, I might have a little relapse, not in which is nothing to do with them. But it just, I'm not supposed to meet in stuff like this. But I'll make an exception because on my low fiber high, I'm my low fat high fiber diet like I told you this is the beginning of my second week. And you get to cheat two meals a week, which I did one last night last week. I got that EDZ ice cream which I'll never do again. It's very good. But when you think EDZ would discover that people don't always buy a half a gallon of ice cream, you know. Because then you start eating a lot more than you want. And then you finally put it. What I do is I take it to the sink and I run hot water on it and then throw it in the, in the big trash can and the garage. Because otherwise I'll eat all of it. I mean, I love you folks at EDZ. You're very nice. You're ice cream a lot of it is very good. But not all of us want a half a gallon every time we go out. To cheat a little bit on this thing. Here's four miles, hello. That was excellent. Oh, that was, that was the beastly done a phone. Thanks a lot. Not sure which one, which one do they let out this week? Here's a lady in sunrise, hello. Hi, New York. Yes, man. Okay, I just something that I want to mention that Dick suck ass from WSBN 7. He has my life mission to make his life as impossible to handle as it can be. Oh, and he noticed that he's always in this middle of the circus. He's got to make, you know, every, he's a ringleader right. It kills me. But anyways, I don't know if any of the listeners know or whatnot, but he, it happened to kill somebody one night on his way home from a football game. No. Yeah, this guy is dead. I'll tell you. I'll tell you. I'm in the pie that he hit in front of a PB park that time. I had a little bit maybe two. I like him. Yes, the guy died not 12 or 95. He died. Yeah, he's dead. Wow, he's dead. I'll be dead. Let me tell you Rick's franchise pleaded. First of all, he's going to plead not guilty. Yeah. But then he changed the story. And he said because he wants to avoid the circus of the media, he will plead no contact. Well, what do you know about the circus of the media? He's the leader of it. All right. He's a homosexual relationship with Neal. So I might as well have one with you too, right?
