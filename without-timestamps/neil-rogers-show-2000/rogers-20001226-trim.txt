Neil Roger's on Sports Radio 560 QA-L. I'll say in another bizarre twist though, I have been banished. I've been put in a closet outside the locker. I can't get out of here. Well, if we have someone listening in Miami who might have a connection to the stadium here, please call and tell them to let Jim manage out of the closet in the locker. Is that you knocking on the door Jim trying to get out? Yes, no, it is. Well, feel free to yell for help at any time. I heard there is no Christmas in the silly middle-east. No trees, no snow, no Santa Claus, they have different religious families. They believe in Muhammad and not in our holiday. And so every December I go to the Middle East and... Bye! Hey, they're Mr. Maslam. Mary, fucking Christmas, but down the foot of the car and I hear some holiday wishing. In case you haven't noticed, the Jesus is birthday. So get off your heat and my form, have the fucking cell up right. There is no holiday season in the hot-turn. They don't hang up, they're stockings and that is just absurd. No, they never read a Christmas story, they don't know what rude office of the house. And that is why in December, I'll go to India and... Hi, they're Mr. Hinduists. Mary, Christmas, three-cognogans, some beef and pastas, two-domans. They can't do having notice. Six-cigmas and partying. So get off your heat and get into it. We sell them right. Now I heard that in Japan, everyone just lives in thin. We play to several gods and put needles in their can. On December 20, they say that they do his eat a cake. And that is why go to Japan and walk around and... Hi! Hi, they're Mr. Shintois. Mary, big Christmas. God is gonna kick your happy, infidelity cake and stuff. Hey, Kati, have it, notice. They're fessin' thanks to you. So let's all rejoice for Jesus' mercy. Christmas, you. Christmas, day. I travel around the world and say... Now it's Christmas, go to Snow, you A-B-S-2. Mary, big Christmas, two-year. And that was for Gary in Fort Lottodale, who facts it a request and pride. But I was already gone on the way to the airport. Gary thanks to the fellow that every morning on a way to work he drives by Northeast High School and Fort Lottodale. This morning, meaning Friday, the BSR always set up a checkpoint at Northeast and is pulling people over for random vehicle checks. All right! As in, Mary, if I'm Christmas to you. I'm going BSR! So I'm coming back from the airport yesterday and we've got the best and the old tape on the year. I'm gonna tell you something, those tapes. With all the respect to Joe Costello sitting right in the other room, I'm not talking behind your back, you know, the best you can, but it's an impossible task. Because they're dated, they're old. And right there on the tape, I'm saying, what up to talk to the sembler? Are we still not on who the president is? And it's the deadline for the electorate. And I'm thinking to myself, oh no, this is such garbage. So bad. I mean, the price is right, they have to pay anybody to come in and do the show? No, no. Terrible. And the reason I mentioned that especially, more so than usual, is because my good post-personal friend, Bill Tanner, are consultant, within Bluffs Office one day last week, Tony and the week. And I haven't spoken to him in three years, along with many other people in this building, for good reason. But in any way, it's said in that aside, you know, he just had triple bypass surgery. So being the nice guy that I am, I figure while he's sitting in there, I can't just walk by the room again and give him a duty. Look, so I go in there, how are you? And during the course of our conversation, he's saying, oh, you know, our service ratings next next next summer best with meal tapes anytime you're not here. Which is a shot at Georgia course, because they hate Georgia near like poison. I mean, they despise Georgia near. And I thought to myself yesterday, after hearing that best of tape, if they played the best of meal all summer, I come back here in September. And we might as well do that funding at noise show, we're talking about the other day. Four hours of fighting noises. So we'll do a pull on that little while. I have a message for the sports halls on his station, not that you have to stop. Oh, God. I come in this morning. I was relieved to see that the walls had an inverted yet from the suction that's been going on here lately. And then I hear Georgia this morning, suckin' up again to Terry Murray because my, and Michael Mayo, and you know what I think of Michael Mayo. I'll try see your he writes a decent column. He wrote about the Bre in and Murray and all that crap. And so he got a little bit killed away, and he was a tongue-in-cheek. You ought to take the stick and hit him over the head with it. And anybody with the brain knows that that was literal. And then I find out from my spies, not to mention Joe, that Terry Murray evidently called Michael Mayo at home in distress over that column. There's been so much suction on his sports halls. When is somebody in this town, other than yours truly, gonna stick up for the four bastards out there who are expected to put up their hard and money to go see crap? And I don't want to mention who show was on, was it last Wednesday or Thursday? Hey, stupid. I don't want to mention who show was. Hey, stupid. But Scott Boros, the man who's helping to put the last nails into coffin of baseball, he's on being interviewed, being sucked on his station. Hey, stupid. For about 40 minutes. And then it if it was, it was just terrifying to me. I'm driving home and I wanted to pull off the road neither start screaming or crying or both. Anarchrad Regas is this, he is the baseball. What Tiger Roops is to go. Oh my god Hank, what are you, they must be taken to next to heavy duty drugs in this place, you know, Chow, where they get in those drugs from? Now, not seriously, what is going on in this place? They must all be on heavy duty and set or something. A rod is the baseball, what Tiger Roops is to go off? Now, you know how I feel about golf and about Tiger Roops, but it's undisputable that he's elevated golf to the level where it is today. Unfortunately, but nevertheless, he's making millions and millions and millions of dollars for people in the sport. And most of the money that he makes, you forget about the tour, are for commercial endorsements. His elevated, a dying brewing game to a level which it otherwise could never have been on. He's a once in a lifetime athlete in his sport. If you want to call it a sport. Alex Rodriguez is he even the, are you a blue, the best player in baseball? No, no. Is he as good as can, graphic? No, Sammy, so set up. No. How many, how many harm-worn championships have you won, Joe? How many triple crowns? How many RBI titles? What, what are his achievements that make him to baseball? How many extra people will come out and Dallas to see the Rangers play when he suits up for the Rangers? Anybody? No. Is there any chance that he'll ever make back for Texas or for the Game of Baseball? The money that 25 million years he's been pay for 10 years. Is there any chance that that will happen? No. But we're in like a Mirafond sub-fest on this station. Now I just don't get it. I don't understand it. And there's nothing that it periods me more than who I mean. If you want to see that you can turn out where it came every night. I'm interested in it. And lots of people, what, not just people getting sucked up to. That's especially. He's making millions of dollars doing it. But why the people on this station feel so competitive that, and, essentially, I have no idea. Now, I was just going to play stuff today and the rest of the week, because it's the holidays and the NIMS slogan, and the power of the good stuff. But now I feel a compilter. There's so many damn exciting things. Or an unforexample just by accident this morning I discovered. I uncover a mystery, which I didn't even know there was a mystery going on until I saw this old litisity back here in the bulletin board. And I looked at it and I was suddenly a little light bulb enough over my head. And I said to myself, Steven B. T. Bow is PD Lenny. It's the same person. And of course the people in the audience are going to be Steven B. T. Bow, what is this man talking about? This was an old hate letter from months and months ago. And it was written by the same person. They wrote the PD Lenny letter the last week. And it's taken me until this moment. I thought it was Brazil all along. Or however it had like goes. Man, this is exciting now. Here's the pair from last Friday, 1174 responses. All the things, is there something with the overheaders that we today? Maybe my ears froze up and tearn over the weekend. Of all the things that Neil talks about, which is the most interesting to you, out of 1174, 2075, politics. Oh, oh, inside radio stuff, 2045, like PD Lenny, and Steven B. T. Bow. And about all the sports circles on this station, they love hearing about that. Religion 2035, hockey 187. I don't, I think that's Burgess. Gaze stuff 86, Amsterdam 68. You know those two are like right next to each other. And after that is the big drop off stock market 208. They know that I know that in about it, it's brewing its depressing 28. The track 25, diet talk 15 and health problems 10. Although we will talk about Joe's father's in hospital, we wish him well. Had a little mild heart attack because the doctors are butchering him up. Miss diagnosing all his illnesses giving the wrong medication. Nice going. Doctors, you butcher's out there. In fact, if anybody's got any need to cut during the holidays, just take your team, they were a doctor. Because doctor and a doctor butcher are synonymous, same thing. 10 on a 10 to 10 at 5, 60 WQM. You'll notice, of course I was out of 10 anyway for the weekend. You'll notice when they the Panther fans will still go, well, I do. They're on Wednesday. Oh, no. Well, I view their on Friday. Oh, I'll be their Saturday because they want to make a possible playing as far in my future plans for the right to the hockey season. That's the only game I'm playing on the being too, when we foresee a real future. There's one release out here. I'll discuss that at great length. Sorry, Gellie. That's just the way it goes. I refuse to be one of those suckholes. I'm just, you know, the thing that's amazing. I'm looking in the papers because my mother saved the papers for me for over the weekend. I don't see anything about it. I see a puff piece about cook mower who had a year and a half whole rendition was at it. I was stiff. I disaster. Did he play here anywhere? Oh, no. And a puff piece about what they hope they can resound like cylinder. Just a bunch of suction, a bunch of puff pieces. A bunch of crap. Which is perfect for this town, by the way. Perfect. For our bedroom communities. No problems. It's hard when they do this. It's not the best written commission. W2AM, these is my task group incorporated. And no luck yet, Jim. Now he's still locking the clouds at down there. Alright. You're gonna cheat me, too. Make him a new shit. All of the old folks are busy, Mom. The checking is easy. No they never say things. Just waiting for their ever special to come. Let's take a little walk. That's just a fool. you live you are like yeah yeah The shuffling in the left To get the early bird out of town The push-in just inside is decaying And once they're seen They get overheat That's the femurose in the swing low and that's it Wasted away here can't be good old hot Looking for that song lost out of you And how they're saying that it's a full of truth The day of the night It's time And animal is the truth Yeah You don't know the reason But nothing is easy The muscles they can't keep just don't fit What does it matter? They call up kneeling in the shadows I hate you feeling that a little bit of your shame I'm not going to do it I'm not going to do it Just the bottom that I'm using that way You How they're saying that it's a full of truth They can't wait for his shuffling How they're saying that it's a full of truth They can't wait for his shuffling They just can't wait for his shuffling It's been my ears as everything is on the left Up here today Strain levels 10.15.50WQAM Stephen T-Bo is peating Lenny How do you like that? That may not have significant to too many people But believe me inside the building The walls are reverberating You could do plot permits already So when I like that I'm not going to be attending any further Panther games except on the least they're here on Saturday Because why waste the gas? I get my tickets for free and I live like 3 minutes away I'm still not going to be going most of the time Because why waste the effort? It would be like going to a restaurant where the food just keeps getting worse And worse and they throw the food action They give you a crappy service and they treat you like garbage And they go out of their way of saying hey nothing's going to change Well guess what if it ever changes let me know And I'll come back But in the meantime, too that's my message And I would hardly encourage other people to move the same Why should anybody continue subsidizing barley When the message is well another thing to change Until he's good and ready until he makes his deal Well in that case we're going back when you make the deal And hope for something better to come along Which this isn't it? How could you not anybody for not going to with to subsidize that crap? Here's Miramar hello Hey Neil Glenn Yes sir I called you right before the election and you were hot for me Because I said I was going to vote with the NRA And I just wanted to know if you saw these 60 minutes to interview with Dan Ravron Bill Clinton Well let me refresh your memory Well wait wait wait wait wait wait man It's the day after Christmas and all through the house What do you want to start out the show today on a political mode? Because they go Hello Please email that I've been here I was speaking which obviously you won't pay any attention I didn't hear a thing that you'd like And it didn't send at least five states the RRA was a key in deciding the election Yeah and what about it? Don't mess with the RRA Okay good have a great life answer How do you like that? Glenn from Miramar another all-time chronic Don't mess with the NRA Maybe if he wouldn't have had you leave him in on the ticket he would have won Which I already know that Which I'm the only person in America who's honest enough to admit that Nobody else in media is talking about that I think oh no Because they're causing anti-chemitism out there Especially if the holiday is especially in the middle of a Connacle would be very palatable to be talking about that Don't mess with the NRA And no Christmas deal to asshole and happy new year Boy if that isn't the perfect call the day after Christmas The first call to get us started today That's it Here's Haley hello Hey Neil Merry Christmas Same team Your show of kind of getting boring Yeah, we'll go find some that I'll support Okay, there's two wanted two excellent 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16 Con 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line It's a good thing I was going to play crap all day and I'll wait long Because they got nothing to say anyway My show's getting kind of boring and how will we look for the NRA We're running a lesson at FU FU and happy holidays This is the perfect place to be Not And you wonder even though it was freezing I froze my ass off up there this weekend And until I was 17,000, but of course that's all See us Didn't bother me It was great like living and breathing people All with smiles on their face Haven't a good time Had a sensational time Got away from this toilet For these hostile, negative people Like I've said before There's nothing wrong with this town That a people transplant wouldn't cure And there's two for two so far Prep vetting a thousand already Here's a great poem From Saturdays New York Times, Greenspan at the bat By Gary Christ The outlook wasn't brilliant for the lost We crowd that mourn The next expert at yearly lows The Dow looked as for a lorn And then when Cisco slumped again in my crime Thought more shocks A poll like silence fellow panel holders of text talks A wretched group sold out in fear of further street And polios The rest hung with single hope to save their sick portfolio Without a horny green spanned fed would change its tightening pack We'd stem our losses bottom out and start the long climb back But first there came the analyst from Jason Merrill Lynch The former was a flagwin beer The latter was a grinch So upon it's stricken multitude grim melancholy fell It seemed that no one on the street knew any word but sell But then an optimist or two as if from a heaven cent It's speculated a cut was near of 0.25% And as the midday our approach The market seems so primed the Dow was up and as decked And even send it climbed And from 5 million charts and more there rose a rusty play At rumble sure the street dot com an on CNBC Relief they cried we need relief or dying of self pity And so our by eyes that turn once to chairman else committee At 2015 the Fed itself had stepped up to the bat Its statement came as always framed in lingua bureaucrat The experts tried to explicate that polis verbal bounty Which was obscured hard to read like folks in Palm Beach County And when his cameras clicked in word the words were read aloud The nation stopped and all did watch their heads suddenly bowed For owners of in telling son of Dele and Motorola The author of this dear decree was like an eye at Tola And even all the journalists from drugs to Tom Costello were hanging on the every word of the soft spoken fellow At first they heard the lovely words are by its one doing In place it's not the danger now we're session maybe brewing And then they listened long and hard for the other shoot a drop For surely if all this was true the this kind of way he dropped But no there was no other shoe he left it all at that The message came to loud and clear the Fed was standing pat No interest cut was in the cards no help no mouth to mouth And so all stocks from a disease resumed or journey south All somewhere in this favorite world of son mushanian bright The birds were dreaming of new highs and bears were taking flight And somewhere stocks were rising making traders shout But there was no joy on Wall Street Alan Greenspan had struck out All right, very christian Saturdays New York Times outstanding Nice going Gary baby Here's a call from Washington, hello Hey, how you doing Neil?

Make me dream of a day, John. I'll be in jail. Oh, hold me. Touch me, you mean, but me, I need my share of love, John. Eight times a day. Eight times a day. Eight times a day. All right. I'm pretty free of five, 60 to the home of happiness. Here's our poor question for today. The best of meal tapes. Are my favorite one, you'll isn't there? Are okay once in a while? Fuck. That's the third choice. Three choices for you. The best of meal tapes. Are my favorite one, you'll isn't there? Are okay once in a while? Or, fuck. Put me down for a fuck. Well, that's good you have to work and put them together. You have to do the impossible job of trying to make them sound timely and fresh. When they're about stuff that happens, just like Glenn from Miramar, calling out of the box. I'm about, hey, we want the election. Guess what? It's all of news ass, huh? It's all of news. Nobody would have brain is throwing on that anymore, okay? Jack asks, get a life loser. Man. Talk about a place, and you know something I'm a part of it. That's right. Twenty-five years I've been here. I feel like part of the world's refuse. I'm right here in the middle of it. You can just, you can smell it. Here's Helen Dale, hello? Yes, I have to take you to task this morning, Neil. Yes? How many times here's you guys set on February? How many times have you guys set on February? I haven't said that South Florida sports fans only support winning teams and hearing you all doing the same thing. It's kind of an idea with winning or losing, so it has to do with making an effort. And the organization isn't making any effort to put out a competitive team. We're winning or losing. We've all been through losing years. The first two years it was a pathetic, over-franchised. It was an expansion team. We were a patient. Now they're making no effort and they're bragging about it. When he was ready to sell a team and he'll do something. And the meantime we can all go to hell. What about the Chicago Cup? How many times have you ever done? They didn't. How to win and team and fifth team. What about the danger, Kyle? Go back to Chicago with your phone, you voice, okay? And say hi to Harry when you're there. There's four in a row. As we continue searching for intelligent life in South Florida. Five, six, seven, five, six. And give a good kiss to Terry Murray to why you read it. And it was probably Terry's boyfriend to stop it just like him. Five, six, seven, five, six. Five, six, five, six. The pound five, six. The only AT&T in Verizon Wireless Line. You know who that sounded like? Any act. Yeah, a little bit. Like Rich tender Jr. Here's Miami glad to see you all on the good mood for the holidays, huh? What do we have, Neil? Yes, sir. Actually, I'm a listener from Washington to see here for vacation. I'm so sorry. Yeah, glad great. I've been listening to the past couple weeks at apps, so I'm really sure that I'd like to discuss. But I'm sure you're a, I've been listening to the tapes every once in a while. Much as I like George, sometimes it's a little fail. I guess that, well, that way, it's much easier like George Wukett's still. Well, that's much as I like to listen to George. Yeah. So, the tapes every once in a while, because sometimes the conversation gets a little off. You mean after the third week on eating ass? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Much as I enjoy that, you know, every once in a while, after a while, it's no more. See, I think one of the problems that I want to knock George Wukett's on vacation, because he isn't telling he's very sensitive. But the fact is, I think that George thinks that the average demographic of the show is like a 17 year old meal. We don't have any 17 year old meals listening to this program. Yeah. You follow what I'm saying? Yeah. So I think that George sometimes is talking to an audience out there that doesn't exist. Yeah. I could be wrong about that. Yeah. Well, actually, I was kind of, I still listen to a show a lot of a week with a whole stadium issue with a mile-in, and I was actually going to take a heated conversation the other day about the mile-in stadium. Yeah. And I actually think it's a waste of money, like hopefully every properly thinking person and the Florida, that's another stadium just complete way to money. Not only that, but it's another back-to-earth deal, because we're going to go to the National University Lawmakers' bucket plan for stadium day delegation members say they were kept in the dark. They didn't know anything about it. Here's another back-to-earth deal that may are a ping-a-paking of a young Henry, and kept everybody else in the dark. Exactly. So, of course, the person who I was speaking with who it was a die hard baseball fan was saying that being that I don't like baseball, I wasn't like baseball. I wouldn't know anything about the baseball culture and how that's going to benefit the whole state of Florida by then building a new stadium. When my argument is that those money are going to be used for this thing should be actually pumping to be very education or what he didn't like, which is a transportation system in Florida. It is a total of domination. And then the last thing is the whole airline. Everybody, every time I listen to you, people are calling in a American Airlines. And I happen to fly American back and forth from DC to Miami, unfortunately quite often. And I have nothing but great, I guess, compliments for them. United actually knew that. Can't beat their hand grenades man. Yeah. United, I want to be the other hand, it's just a piece of dirt. So, to be... No, never fall United in my life. Well, you want to. The last three times a form of them is either been delayed, the planes canceled, or just no flight whatsoever with no answer. The only good things I've gotten free vouchers for next flight, which is again, get the canceled. Well, that's been the good luck with your colors today. And hopefully I will have to call it a while. Okay, happy new year to you. Thanks for breaking a string. We finally had like a real living and breathing person, but of course he's from out of town. Speaking of airlines, air Canada. With all the respect to my friend Helen and all my other good friends at air Canada. Air Canada blows. Man, are they rape in the public or what? Now that they got to my lovely, they bought all Canadian here. And just like everybody expected. Number one, they're incompetent. They can't get to act together up their appearance in Toronto. Number two, they keep jacking up the rape. They're laying off 35,000 employees or whatever. Hello, number is 3,535,000, 35 million. Whatever it is. And the fear is, do you realize that business class for Miami to Toronto? Because just about as much of the taxes now is flying from Miami to Amsterdam business class on Martin's gear. Did you realize that? No. Well now you do. And that fruit on air Canada? Man, heavy, dirty is what it tastes like. By the way, the way I'm going to find out about that show. I got to ask on here about that show on Warner Bros. Last night, I'm channel surfing because there's no hockey games on. I'm certainly not going to watch it stupid game. You're talking about the tytunes. So about eight o'clock, I come across Warner Bros. Which is channel, I don't know, 33, 39. I have no idea. One of those. You are a chivalrous. And eight o'clock, eventually, on Monday, there's a show with the bizarre. Everybody's horny on it show. That's my kind of show. And what did I tell you, they're starting to catch on young people high school and like, you know, a little bit older than that. You know, like 23 people playing 18 year olds, things like that. Some pretty interesting people on that show. And even even the minister who's dead on the show with the seven kids, even he's horny and jacks up with the old lady and I'm old tell for the night. Well, the kids are getting late. Somebody's got to call in and let me know what the name of that show is. Show me yours, I'll show you mine. Oh, stand for lunch. Cause we're too cheap to tell. Oh, stand for lunch. But turn your offer with us. Oh, you're a leapers. You are a child like her. I bought more than give the store a break. We're perfect for a fight. And why? Oh, you can't our hike. We'd have our week a day. Oh, our journey to food. If smoke's there my wish. Oh, stand for lunch. We eat the Irish eat. We don't kill our own. There my lunch. We eat the smoke. I'll wait a week. We'll have a week. We'll wait a week. You know, I have a long time. Yeah, I love that. She played a lot more. Five, six, seven, five, six. You notice I do my time to wait about this. A panther organization in about my response to the fact that I'm just. Well, not participate. And what do I get? I get one of the guy with a funny voice from Helen Dale by way of your cargo gives me a song and the answer about the cubs and all the other bookcraft. I mean, you do whatever you want. I can't force you. And I have no interest in force. You have a my suggestion is my suggestion is if you're as pissed on. If you're as pissed off and frustrated as I am, you stop subsidizing a billionaire who doesn't give a crap about you who's slapping you in a face. Yeah, but we already got our season tickets a big deal. Got my season tickets sitting in a drawer. Should be my biggest problem if I don't use some of them. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. Hey. Yes, sir. I just wanted to tell you the name of the show is 7.7. Yes, we had several calls. Oh, oh, oh, and another thing. You know, I just started watching hockey. Yeah. And I just wanted to include me on what is I think exactly. 5.670560 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's our only other call. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey, Neil. Hi, Neil. Well, I like to talk to you about hockey. I know we are ready for a street. Yeah, huh. You know who that is, don't you? From Hollywood. Okay, that's it. That takes here the calls. And you see, I did not tell you before we started the show today. I was just going to play crap all week because it's a holiday. And we weren't going to get any calls. But, you know, I never learned my lesson. Never ever learned my lesson. I actually thought I was going to get a response here today. And all I got are the no-wives like that jacket, who knows that I'm not going to put them on a year. Know that I don't want to talk to them. My good friend, Glenn, for Miramar, long time listener to show for about 100 years. But has to call right in the middle of a holidays to give me a stroke about the NRA and a morning election. Man. See, I guess if I were stuck here with the holidays, when everybody's supposed to be in a good mood, I probably be as bitter and frustrated as what are you two. But I'm not because I got out of here for a long three day week. And I'm pretty happy about it. Even if I am getting the court, I'm probably going to get pneumonia. I don't care. I'm still glad that I went. Like in a real living and breathing city, with the real people. I'm walking down the street. I'm walking from the Eaton Center back to my hotel. I'm Saturday. And I'm thinking to myself, even though there's always still on the ground, and it's 80 million below zero, I'm thinking, this is a real city. How could anything that goes on here in this God forsaken place? How could anything here be confused as being a real city? But if not, all you people are keep using all this span about world class city and all this other, you're not kidding anybody. You're playing with yourselves. You're just trying to be a lood yourself. This is a bunch of disconnected little bedroom towns with nothing in between. There's no center. Oh, we're going to build a stadium at downtown. I'm guessing there is no downtown Miami. There's nothing there. Except the Miami-Frick and Hero. And G-Side, there's nothing there. And nobody wants to go there, but don't confuse us with the facts. Here's a call in Kendall, hello. Yes sir. Got to find out. I've been out of town. We're having a Kelly Craig. She blew up. Yeah? I just wanted to wipe you so fat. Probably because she's eating too much. You're called her up and asked her why she's so fat. There's another great call for you. What happened to Kelly Craig? She got fat. 560505060 on the AT&T and Verizon line. Bad mistake, Neil, taking these calls. Bad mistake. Call up the drug dealer. Here's a mobile phone. Here's a mobile phone. Hello. Hello. Good drugs. What is it? You're in Toronto. You still live in Detroit. You've started trying all the time. I did a great job. Yes sir. Have you ever had any more now? People are not going. And it shows in all the scores. The basketball arena is half empty. Yeah. The hockey arena. They're pricing themselves to the point where... Well, they're depressing themselves out of business. Plus the fact is with the Panthers when they're going out of their way to slap people in the face and say, we're not going to make any changes. They played 35 games and they have six wins and I'm the only one in this town that's athletic and had to get a risk breakdown and saying, let's stop supporting this crap. Well, you know, we wanted to have the big boys. But people are... A boys can by now go and I haven't gone... I don't want to want to share. You go and get every five or six games that you should go. But I've been on the money. What they're putting out there, I wouldn't wish on Hitler. I'll put it that way. The Sparish Tiger Woods. At least whatever he's accomplished, he's done it himself. That's right. You know, so whether you like him or not or whatever the guy happens to be great, what he does... I mean, how to compare that to make a comparison that A-Rot is to baseball what Tiger Woods is to golf. I mean, Hank must have been doing magic mushrooms that day. I don't know why he felt compelled to suck Scott Borges as... I mean, here's a guy who brings nothing to the table but greed. That's the only thing that all these agents are bringing is greed. They're destroying professional sports and we've got to suck his ass on the year. I don't get it. I don't know. As a kid, I loved baseball. I don't care what I was right here. My dad worked overtime to get me a Wilson autograph, leather mitt. But I just... I just can't do baseball anymore. It's a shame. Yeah. If they paid me by the pitch, I wouldn't go there. No. It's a shame. Okay, pal. Have a nice New Year. And have a same to you. See, there's a good guy having a nice New Year. Here's enough to send his very best day. Some of you other sour places out there. You're trying to prove my point. What this town's all about? Misery loves company. We're miserable. We're angry. We're angry. We're angry. We're angry. We're angry. And we want you to be just as miserable. Well, yes, what I won't. Because I got a big fat check. I'm putting it to bank for Saturday noon about 2.15. Okay. So, you guys, would you stupid idiotic calls? This is Glenn from Miramar. And at the end of the day, he's going to blow your ass off. Down the rock. Put your honor down from the floor. Who's it? this morning you walked in the door? Great move. Yeah, I was in trying to smooth. I was happy. Yeah, maybe a little scratchy throat. What do you want after 20 below zero all weekend? A dog bothering me? Who is it? Made the comet the other day. There's no such thing as bad weather. They're just being underdressed. Yeah, that's right. Just being underdressed for the weather, whatever it is. Here's a mobile on coconut greek, hello. Oh, yes sir. This is coconut greek, not coconut greek. Oh, wow, whatever. First time one time Neil, and you are absolutely correct sir. Anybody who thinks that this is a leader going to a living and breeding place? Just listen to your show this morning and look what's going on here in the last couple of months. Yeah. I can coconut greek, but not supposed to be a place that occasionally is living and breeding people. I go to the parks for lunch on the Matt Nade and they all have a blue here and one of them I swear. That's not a meal. After the meal, she takes out tin foil. Yeah. From her bus, she brought with her to check her dog event. Where is the rat? I can get my entire life. Yeah, the rat goes down here. She brought her own tin foil. And you know, people are another thing that totally changes subject. A lot of people talk about how the athletes in today have changed sports, but the owners have too. I mean, you have jackasses like Daniel Snider and Jerry Jones and you've got baldies who are successfully wound one branch I've found here. And is well out of the way to destroying another one. I hope that baldie gets a tumor inside his perfect size of a bone ball. I can't begin to put in the words how I despise that creaton. Well, you go get him the only answer to get many changes. And this kind of thing is just like with anything else. So you have to actually get up your can and do it. And you know, it would sport it to, you know, don't give him your money. That's what they want. You can't give him a problem. I hope that when they play the flyers on Wednesday night, I hope that places are ghost town. Well, you know, you know, the South Florida sportsman who are letting money deal. I'm surprised that people are showing up now, but if this continues next year, I mean, forget it. There won't be anybody. Everybody who have their own private hot dog. They're going to be a dollar a dollar. Yeah. Okay. You have a good one. Happy holidays. Bye. Happy New Year. Jeff and New Year, everybody, we're in a good mood over here. Even though some of you out there need some serious, serious mental health. 56050560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's Lake Ruella, fellow. Good afternoon. Good evening. Good morning, New High. Buenos dias. I over walk. Well, I know you're not shocked, but I don't know why you expected it to be any different when you came back. Today's call, perhaps for the microcosm of what you have down here in this one horse. So three, three flat American state we live in. We get the kid who's over there in Highly with his brother who makes the crank calls on the day about the show is getting boring. That's the first of his 20 calls today. We get Andy from Hollywood who's banned from the show. Who starts out, hey, how you know, like I'm really going to talk to him. Who's a chronic pain in the ass in a piece of turd. That's all we got. That's what I guess. I'm going to be happy that living and breathing people got out of here for the holidays and Congratulations to them. Do you think there's any kids that people might get upset over what you're saying about the panthers when they came to you up so the fact that they've had these banana pop-like officials like can get the new year. No, no, no, no, no. I'd wait for the whole day. I've been talking about the time that you mentioned that because I was listening to my stuff on that best of pay driving home from the year for yesterday and I'm thinking to myself, what am I talking about about the textbooks and about school? The public here doesn't care about those things. If they did care about them, we wouldn't have the problems that we got. People here don't care about education who they're on my kidding. It's funny. I'm hoping that we can see a nice reaction today for the talk about the panthers. And then they can tomorrow we can get into second subject. We're going to take our states, our countries that are worrying about sports and thoughts about it. And like you said, doing this, we're going to ask behind. We're not going to have to pan and check to any one of a dozen schools. Any day before Christmas, all the end of this year, have some of the tax breaks. But do you think that's not a chance? The items are so dynamic. They're a plane charter and take 20 of their friends on a million five trip and everybody can brag about so people who work for. It's just amazing how sad it is in the end. The worst part about it is at least in the old days, right? At least the old days you knew was just temporary or a seaser. You could then you can line up and know who you were bound to. Now you don't know. You got to hit and shot more than that, which is. That was a scary. That was a most disgusting thing I've ever heard on a radio in my life. That was just unbelievable. We could go on. I was on the phone and made my weekly call. And this was the last week that was the hack. And it was after I saw many remeers by this contract. And I mentioned the hack that the fact that the sound that they'll hear when many remeers was the hobby and it would be the changes. It's super off the table. So the maid can't even get a box for the day. And these guys are out there and the stop bar says kiss and hate. Kiss is real. This guy is. This guy is probably in a crisis. It's probably a buzz. Yeah. I was doing trying to stick to everybody. Not care what it is. You are anyone else. I don't know. And if I give up the guy who's for going up to 20 to 29 year old guy. He's got a farmer of dollars at 8 or 9 now. Lots to go and take into some professional 40. I don't want to take that. I want to take that. I guess the things that change maybe we're all supposed to be in the ass sucking business. No, have a great day pal. Happy new year. Hang in there. 10. 56 in your ass sucking headquarters QAM. This is 5. 6. QAM. 4. 3. You can't have my M. I'm easily broadcast group station. WQAM. What an embarrassment. What an embarrassment. What a joke. Yeah, me, me, Krayer. What a soul on the news is hard. I believe my God, Jason, just learned my lesson. More easy, the weird. Happy new year. Happy new year. Because I'm so happy. Because the person saying that she don't need it, some more to avoid the crazy team with the weirdo. I'm going to kill her. He's a weirdo. I guess the wrong amount is damn. No she won't understand. The sky seems all in no fun or way. I ain't like you, Lee. He ain't got no danger. But I just cannot turn right here. I really think you're the one who must understand. Is it girling man with a plastic nose, brother Francis round in a panic hole? He's a weirdo. He's a weirdo. Well now be in there, things so bad because it won't ever get to call me down. He's a weirdo. He's a weirdo. I don't blame you all this. Whether I'm 2560 WQM, happy holidays from your happy friends, you XUM. If you're unhappy, well, you know, two bags. Go get laid. Do something. Here's a schedule change from one of our chronics. The elite Pittsburgh game on Wednesdays. They've been moved from 7 to 7 30. So the ESPN will be carrying it instead of ESPN too. Because it's a big deal. Now, CBC got real lucky. Not that anybody down here cares about that. I just mentioned that in passing if you have a big dish. Only even in the ESM. They originally were scheduled. They schedule a Pittsburgh game like for the holidays. They never carry a midweek game. Do they? No. Only hockey net and Canada, etc. But they had that game scheduled. And with their luck. Look at the Irish and John Shannon got fired. Good boy. They're carrying a game on Wednesday night on CBC with Bob Cole and her New York from Pittsburgh. Somebody slap Bob in the back and wake him up a little bit. Okay. Should be pretty interesting game with Mario coming back. Anybody know who Mario is? No. No. There you have a bigger. Well, speaking that Joe wants food. What a surprise. See when Joe is on here all week. We got to eat. Find with me. I'm ready. I took my diuretic yesterday and peed out about five pounds. I'm ready for a little something. Feed your court and serve a fee. We're not that have a cool day. I got a scratchy joke. I mentioned that because I know my mother's listening. What's wrong with you? You go up there. It's freezing. It's below zero. Yeah. It's below zero. It's a sheath. I'm from Celsius and Fahrenheit. So she knew that when I got in the cab early yesterday morning and Toronto the cab driver said because they have you know on the signs it'll show you what the temperature allegedly is on side. On all the big good words and it said minus 17. 17 below zero. Celsius. Which is about nine or ten degrees. For less. Fahrenheit. And other words it was even cold. So what do you want? What are we going to get? Not those greasy sandwiches. Whatever you think. I got to get the thing off the wall. That's the thing. One more please. Now this is the best. See I had forgotten about this other letter and Lauren behold we were talking about the peat lanyliter from the last week and on a back on a bulletin board we had stuck this one from months ago from a phony a name Stephen B. T. T. Bow who's the same asshole. They wrote the peat lanyliter. But you got to hand it to whoever wrote these letters. These are great. A sureful of fart noises and belches from eating fat killed cold cut sandwiches wouldn't be hit anywhere but a crap house like this. What an excellent. I mean the verbiage the the phrasing the the just the uh this is fantastic. Not the course to mention the hate which fits in perfect in this time. Like a glove. Why don't know what he happened mine. What choices do we have? Totally. It's always good. I'll tell you to hold a bunch of peats and stuff whatever you like whatever makes you happy. Call up all the friend bread at Tony's just don't tell that's JP. Oh. Now you did mention that I had totally that at Pitzelau. Yes. Well that there was a message from J.P. My answering machine last week. Never called back though. Never called back to say that he's here and he's reading whatever and that's okay because I got 7th heaven on Warner Bros. not a watch. It's not as good as heaven, J.P. in person like you know right in the palm of your hand so to speak. That's a good show. I mean it's not a good show but it's got some hot people on it. Whatever you like it's on there. And if you live here in old farts, even mommy and daddy they're even a preacher in his wife they're horny. Everybody on a show is horny. Even a little kid down there they're horny. Everybody on Warner Bros wants to do it. So yeah. My kind of show. So who do you want to need to go out and watch some stupid hockey game when you can watch that? Here's a mobile and lake worth. Hello. Nearly every right to be full of piss and vinegar this morning. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I just wanted to tell you I was back in Toronto a couple months ago probably back in March or April. Yeah. And for the first time what a great city. Between. We ate in the sea and tower watching over the lake just had a wonderful time. Yeah. And even though there was no one to ground it. It was a quarter in hell. There's all these onions of people down town because it's Christmas time and it was great. I had a tremendous time. I had meal with the pickle barrel there. I had some the give you enough enough meatloaf there to build a mountain with it was tremendous. We were riding on the street cars for entertainment because we were there for business but at a great time and then took a lot over to Niagara Falls. Every day of everything to offer and it's clean. It's a lot of people are do something nice. Everybody bring the language. Yeah. It's wonderful. Yeah. Can I check around for taking my nephew to one of the hockey games that you're not going to? Can I explain something to you? Yes sir. You see one of the reasons that I'm not going is to express my dismay and discontent. And the best way to do that is to have a good time. Good time. So the answer is no. Five, six, seven, oh fuck can you can you yes you can't believe it. Why do I keep saying can you believe that? Of course all I have to do is to hear the guy that calls that's given me a big song to the answer about because I was just in Toronto for the weekend which isn't really all that important to anybody else except me. But oh it's so great and you're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. Get ready to hear the numbers. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. No, not night you. I'm talking about Miguel. He's listening in there. He's the one. He's listening. He's not listening. Claudia will not be the shower. 567.0560. Pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Happy New Year, baby. Yeah, he'll take care of it. He said he's going to stop on it. And the project project too. Yeah, you're right. Neil, that's a lot of great city box. We went there and we got on a street car. They got on the street car. And by the way, how about those tickets? I'm surprised we have an any women free loader's yet. Askin provides tickets. Maybe that broke a bit of the call enough. Oh, can we see in your seats? In fact, what I ought to do is make sure I send a message over to the usher to make sure that nobody puts their asses in my seat. Those games will not be the only one to be in Friday. Because the purpose of the protest is that the seats are empty. Empty. So that the place looks like a ghost town. So that maybe some of us make a statement like we're not putting up at this crap anymore. Like our patience is running out. Like we're sick and tired of subsidizing garbage and being slapped in the face. Six wins. And we're supposed to sit around or wait till it's expedient for a way until the sale gets done. Guess what, Wayne? That's for you, sweetheart. You've evolved at it. Son of a bitch. Yeah, that's right. He's a bald headed rotten son of a bitch. What he is. He's the son of a bitch who stole Christmas, New Year, Khanica, poor on antsookers. How do you like that? And like I said, I hope that he gets a guy to inform where the size of my rice more. This is five, 60. You aint waiting. Hi. Hey. No. No. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yeah. That way, he might take a such an asshole. Yeah. He'll that manage that three-chirred. Because he would take a shower with takeover asshole asshole. You turned each way high to think of such an asshole. He's just like Hitler and a brawn. What's that? He's pouting on any other term. I thought I wouldn't do rough running to imitate all太 tall types. Too bad you just cut off thatANDern 돌 Ahaan Yakutsu this is something that doesn't really matter. He can run alive. We'll do some of these works. Nah, that's right. You know, if I'm making as much money as Josie Lambe keeps wearing the newspaper oughta be able to retire by the end of the week off. Every every column that keeps getting up a little higher. Yeah, it says it was a prosperous year for some. Radio talk, myster Neo Rogers contract with WDQM was extended to 2004. Each year he'll be paid nearly $1.5 million with, oh, yeah, he's got oil written up, five months of vacation in the year. What an half million year now, I'm up to. Stay tuned for next week's column. We'll be up to three million. Yeah. Nice going, Josie. 560, 50, 50, 50, pound, five, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. On a great Tuesday, man, you can feel it. Can you smell it from this cloud? Oh, piled up the ceiling in North to charge. How's that survey coming, Neo? The best of Neo page 59 votes so far. I'll talk 22. I'll okay once in a while, 21. Am I favorites when he wasn't there 16? That's inclusive, at best. But suck leads the way. Okay, I mentioned that very loudly. suck leads the way those best ideal tapes suck. They're outdated. They're outmoded. They broke. Who the hell in their right mind is going to listen to a paper somebody talking about stuff that happened weeks ago or months ago or a year ago? Let's hear about alien in the pope. One more time. Just in case you missed it the first 80,000 times. Here's a mobile and fortlaterale. Hello. Happy Sonic and Neo. Back to you. Hey, listen, about that guy that wanted to pick it up on the plenty of hell, we'll go by. Right, exactly. All he wants. I got one thing I'd like to share with you. I was with him to NPR last week and had a guy on him. What you say about this being a bunch of disconnected little bedroom towns is absolutely correct sir. But what happens recently is the three counties, date, Howard and Palm Beach, finally come together to form a planning commission. And they're looking at doing things like creating a new, especially along US one, but all the towns are going to freak out about. Yeah. They're talking about growth happening in the next 20 years, 1.8 million people here. And if they don't do something about it, we're a big trouble. But the good news is, and I noticed it's hard to believe, that three counties have actually come together and did a sit down to talk about these things. Whether it comes to that, you know, you're probably not knowing this. Yeah, probably like the old sports authority. Remember that last year for about five minutes? Well, you know, at least there was encouraging to hear that they're finally looking ahead a little bit. Yeah, and trying to figure out something to make it better instead of watching it, so much worse. You know, but you've got to bring it on the pulse and thanks for letting me go. Okay, I'm still looking forward. Have a great day. So the pulse that is 560505050. Oh, I can't smell it. I can't feel one. Hey, it's an American much you're doing. You're always talking about not supporting a loser. It's not about that guy from hell and they'll, he was my favorite. Maybe of the year. Even with the full new voice. You missed his calls off the air. They were even better. Really? Yeah, I mean, I'm going to say what? He yelled at me that you were a big hypocrite. And then hung up in my face. And then called back in a apologize for doing it. Really? Yeah, he said he shouldn't take it out on me. Yeah, probably something like sunny Rosenberg to maybe, maybe his boyfriend, RJ Intendol over there in a hell and there with all those losers, losers, losers, or became decrepit losers with a lot of goddamn toe gym. Maybe their bag is overflowing. You know how sand is bag is overflowing this time of the year. At least before he came down the chimney. And all your little kids out there don't have to come down the chimney. George, go back for your health. The rover is at the bottom. A lot of stuff going around. Here's a mobile and nice palm. Hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Well, you know, I have to call the agreement. I don't know what's up with these sports holes in the morning and in the afternoon. Challenge some of these owners and players that they're talking to. You know, give them a good agreement once in a while. Well, they're going to do these players and these owners are not going to call the show. These coaches. I don't want to do a show. I want to do a show. I want to do a radio. Yes, I'll only do want to do a suck ass. I mean, the second sound is not Mexico. It's a 2 AM and Miami. It's ridiculous. I mean, there is no light whatsoever. Radio is dead. The federal government let clear channel. It's not local radio anymore. You're the only right spot from 10 to 2, you know, 150 mile radius. And I'll put it so it's yeah. It's ridiculous. I just don't know what to do anymore. I mean, it's not. Okay, pal. Good luck to you. All right. Say how to the search party. 560560, pound five 60 on the AT&T and I know all these excuses. Well, we already got our ticket because I remember years ago. I tried to do the same thing back when we had to know BMS stuff going on. And they all wanted those free buttons. That was very popular. But you know, there's a group of people who come up. There's about a half a dozen people. They like to come up and say hi to me before each game. It's become very pond risk because it's always the same discussion. And it's getting old. You know, it's the same bitch for us. But now what are we going to do and Terry and BMS? I'm tired of it. It's not entertaining anymore. It's not interesting. It's it's massacism. That's all it is. There's no point in being there. When somebody tells you that they're not going to do anything until they're good and ready when it's financially expedient for them to make some kind of a deal. And they're going to continue putting the same direct out there over and over again and just keep coming and sucking it all up. They answer, there was no. No, thank you. God. How stupid and how lifeless can we people be to keep going back from old punishment? And I'm just not going to be one of those people who's going to do it. I've had enough. I'll go there. I'm Saturday to see my team come in at town. Hopefully they'll show up. They finally play the game list last Saturday after taking a couple days off. And then whether they do or not, at least I'll enjoy seeing them. But this product that they're putting out there, they ought to have a refund window after the last couple of months. They ought to be given a refunds up just to try to pacify some people to come back again. And some of you are so stupid and such man's a kiss in such no life, you keep showing up over and over again. How much crap did they have to put out there before your final sex? No thanks. I'm not even going to waste 50 cent gasmight to come and see this. Even with free tickets, Joe. Here's Boca. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, my name is Andre. I'll listen to you every day. Uh-huh. You got a great show. Yeah. So I have to call one of the day like this one. I got the day off. I always love to go out of town. And they want to come back. As soon as you hit Miami airport and you land. The pressure was cloud. Yeah. That comes over here. A dark cloud. You just can't believe it. I agree with most of the stuff that you talk about every day. And I tell you, I work. The paperwork I do. I work at John Henry's house. You have to put booties on to go into his house. He has a Harley in front as you walk in. Yeah. You made out of wood. This thing is probably $25,000. I must be crazy. I must be nuts. You must be nuts. I'm saying I work in the interior design. Still, then I've worked in his house. He has arm guards around the house. He can't infiltrate. The better the hitman of a very exclusive community in Boca, called LeLack. What? LeLack L.E. L.A.C. You can't get in there. All the big wiggers. That's what they live. The big wiggers, yeah. They got the big time homes and stuff. But I wouldn't pay to go to any. I used to go to the games before. But I stopped going because there's bombs when you get the park and the walk. But I'm making a line, Marina. Or if you go to the stadium, Joabi, Hawking, ten, fifteen bucks. Twenty bucks, yum. Okay, I'll go to the other. I have a happy new year. Kill a me. Five, six, seven, five, six. And don't step on those abudies. Pound five, six, the only AT&T in Verizon World was flying. Out of townline is open of course. Out of townline. How about those answers? I mean, those are good folks over there in four miles. How are they doing? Eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, five, six, three, four, five. I'm not really sure who's worse off. Here's plantation. Hello. Plantation. Oh, yes sir. Is that me? That's you. How you doing the idea? I'm taking the year. I'm a first time call a long time loser. Uh-huh. Because I lived here for 45 years. Yeah. But I got something for you on your favorite subject. The exercises. They had a show on the public service station at a West Palm. Uh-huh. About the exercises that it was true. It was actually a true story. Yeah. And then they had an interview with the guys. He wasn't pleased at the exercises. Uh-huh. He was a beacon. And he was still alive. And then interviewed him. He was a beacon-doulson. Oh, not sure. Okay. Well, he was still alive. And then he had a minute of use. And then they had a counter. What the woman who was like a psychologist or psychiatrist or something. Yeah. And everything that he said about the work of the double being on his skin. It was all of psychological management. Anyway, she had a good combat to everything that happened in the world. Yeah. Anyway, if you would get the tape, they said at the end of the show called the station. And it sent you a tape. You would love it. I mean, I was watching and saying, oh my God. Oh, I got a new one. I got a price to pay the shit. Yeah, oh. Uh-huh. It was great. Anyway, they had the happy new year. Okay. Watch where you spray that holy water, pal. Okay. Okay. Have a good life. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. That's my favorite subject is the exercises. Why not? You hop on all the boys. I'm going to cap it. No. No. Can't do it. 560, 560. It really is said those poor, homeless people up north. They're sitting out there on young street with their little cup out just freezing to death and a snow on the ice. Sparrows and change, mister. It's really kind of sad to walk by those people. And not even given like a loony or nothing. What? You don't even give them anything. Nothing. Wow. Zero. Well, you know what it's like. It's like an addiction. Once you start, it's like a bad habit. Once you start doing that, you can't stop. I recently quit. Then by the time you got to the end, if you were like walking, of course, that's a longer street in the world. But if you were walking, walking from Blurstery, which is, well, you wouldn't know where it is. It's going to say that you're a 40-young street, which is a couple of miles. You'll be broke by the time you got to the, to the lake. By the time you got to the Skydome. 560, 705, 60, pound, five, 60. I'm sorry. I'm not that I'm tight. You know that I'm not cheap. It's not that I'm hard ass, but I just don't give money to you. I used to do it. I, you know, spare some change, Mr. But it just reaches the point. There's so many slippers out there between Amsterdam and between there and the here and everywhere. I just can't do it. Here you get a cost of our sports or every street corner now. They got some scam gold. And now they're handing out those homeless newspapers. And I keep thinking of myself. If you could afford to print that newspaper, why not take the money at cost to print the newspaper and go buy a sandwich with it or a cup of coffee or a couple of beers, something. And those guys are pushing. You know, they knock on your window. I mean, for all the money that they're putting that new newspaper, where they could do it, they're buying drugs. Here at QAM. Yeah, we're going to be talking about that today. Anybody got their names in a good weed for the holidays. 26 packs 11 at 560, QAM. This is 4960, QAM. You got it. That's it. Tonight on TVA, eat it. It is back from the day. It fits one of the anniversary of all of the family. Oh, rookie death. If you need John Jellow weed. Daddy, don't be such a pro. Now, whatever happened to my little girl, who can't you? Why don't you push yourself away from the table, huh? Maybe have a salad once in a while. Daddy, don't you know how many of the worst people have never had a decent meal? Again, with the charity spirit. Well, it's true. Charles, why don't you send them the bones from the turkey you had for breakfast? No, whatever. No, whatever. Come on, come on. Come on, we get hot today. It's great. Good. You get that chocolate you was pushing on the day, you guys. Oh, no, I keep the rest of the day. I was going to be a treat. James, you're a bad, you mean? Well, when was it back there, baby? First of the day, you're going to be in the middle of the beer. Come on. What are you having with us? What are your family's three of all of the family? Saturday night on TV air. Rock you by, IBS home college fun and school. Where you can learn all of the mechanics, done my parents. Oh, that's just... You know, at the first time ever noticed when she said IBS, it rang a bell. Lemon 30, it maybe Kelly Craig is eating some of Sally's brothers leftovers. Maybe that's the problem, Kelly. 11 30, it's 560 WKOM, 560, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, 050, You know, schools are here on me or starts messing with me. The inclination is to just kick them in the nuts. But the tension is so thick there or was that, you know, the cops and those security people, you just, you know, make the run move and you find yourself in handcuffs real quick. There are not many questions that you sorted out with the judge down there. It just became too ridiculous and since that sound flag were done track, that's the best, you don't even have to be a football fan. All those gavelers in there between the dog races on TV and all the football games on TV that are running around telling their hair out of its hysterical. Now, see, thanks to an assure slide, where it is, matter of fact, when you should mention that. Well, it's not much like that, there's much going on. But when you get the football and the dog races being simultaneously and about 20 pay phones up there, you can code you. That's the show in itself. I guess I'm not a hockey fan and I don't go to hockey games, but it seems to me that they're in the pretty much the same situation as the heat down here. You know, you can see on TV those empty seats. First of all, if you buy a ticket upstairs, even if it's the lower part of the upstairs, it's like watching from the 747 and that place. I don't know if you've ever been there, but if you want to actually see the game, you got to get a 60 dollar ticket. But the thing is, you know, if you want to go, don't run out and buy tickets at the gate. There's so many people down there with extra tickets. I never pay 20 more than 20 dollars for a 60 dollar. There's a big distinction between the two things. Okay, I'm not that I care about the NBA or about the heat, but the fact is that you know, Alonza morning had the kidney ailment and he's got a Mr. Seedman who knows if he was ever going to play again. All I business. That's something that was beyond their control. It wasn't that they weren't willing to spend the money to put a good product out there. But with a Panthers, they've got a lack of talent that's that the glaring at best. They've made all kinds of mistakes and management. And instead of firing the general manager, the coach both of them putting them on a bus, making some kind of a move, the fans are supposed to sit back and what they keep telling us is, well, Wayne is trying to sell a team. He makes a deal then they make some moves. Well, that could happen now. It could happen in too much. It could happen at the end of the season. That's like slapping people in the faces like saying that Wayne doesn't really care. What kind of product he puts out there, but he expected to continue to subsidize it. And the answer was got to be no. Yeah, I can understand. He plays 35 games and they have six wins. They couldn't win a fifth game and people are supposed to subsidize this. Yeah, I can see where it's now. You don't want anybody to go out of protest. Yeah. Yeah, like the situation in the basketball, you know, a lot of people that are staying away that won't go. They just go and you know, trying to pick up a ticket, you know, just, and they're selling it. Even they have to start selling some of their $60 seats for $30. Yes, to get people. Of course, when the Lakers came, it was pretty much part that it even bought. It also back to greed again if they're going to have to keep building new stadiums and new arenas so that the fans have to keep paying wild prices to pay these over and play to athletes and their agents. And guess what, people are going to stop going and we have. I hope so, but they keep selling. I don't understand how people can go out and buy season tickets. When you know you're not going to go to most of the games. I mean, I didn't realize the regulations. You're forgetting you still a lot of that is corporate crap. But I don't know where it's going to end, but if they end that building, the baseball stadium downtown, hopefully they won't, but if they do, I'm going to be for a bleachersy $25. It's going to be like the Yankees. Don't be just too loud. Yeah, I think they like to ask, bro. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. 87 votes on our pool today that totals are way down because there's nobody in town, obviously. Best of the meal takes suck, winning in a very tight contest. 33 people say they suck. I voted for suck. They're okay once in a while, 31. They're my favorite when he wasn't there only 23. Should I say only 23 years, 23 in a bursting, pretty embarrassing. Here's a lady in Duel. Hello. 5, Neil. How are you? Okay. You just touched upon something that I actually called about a half an hour ago about the fact that these owners really don't care. It's not the sports sense. They only care about the corporate seats. Once they've sold out all those corporate seats in the skybox, they've got enough money that they don't care about the rest of us. Well, then if they got enough money, then what are they need? Mine money for? Or anybody else that would be saying people? They can't get mine money anymore. I'm sure. But there's one thing I want to say. You know, and this is not sucking up. It's just the truth, okay? In your lifetime, you've raised over a million dollars for charity. Sure. I sure is how it wouldn't feel bad about not giving a couple of pennies here and there. Oh no, I don't feel bad about it. No. Okay. Because there's just so many of these poor people out there, and the fact that the cities, for example, Toronto, which is a very wealthy city, would a lot of tremendously wealthy people live there. They just haven't made it a priority. They just, I mean, it's always a big issue up there, and they're always having protests and it's ongoing thing. There's no reason why people have to be out on the streets, especially in the wintertime, freezing their asses, I have to feel so acceptable. That's right. You know what I do? I think there's this, there's this product line called Pot-Shilf. Right. It's meal thought. Right. Basically, you can keep in your car. Mm-hmm. And I give them, you know, why I say that, you know, begging? I'll give them food. Yeah, but you have to cook that in a microwave. No, no. The Pot-Shilf, you can eat, you can just pull it off and eat it right there. Oh. You have to be kidding me. I used to buy those in a supermarket, even in a microwave there were rank. Have it to know what if you're hungry. Yeah, you're right. Let it let me top-shelfe good point. Walking all out, and no seriously, you're really bad hungry. And if you don't want it, you throw it away. Okay. You know, at least I feel good about me. This is getting a little sternal with it or something. You're not gonna ask. Have a great holiday. Bye-bye. What? I sure hope Tony's gets here soon. Have you ever had top-shelfe? No. I'll get a cat that you send to the spot. That next deck was back years ago. And they were like, they're okay. They're in boxes. And you put them into my microwave. They have like a lasagna and they have a spaghetti. They're only about four or five different kinds of things. I've given homeless people money, food, the happiest ever was last Thursday. I gave them a full jack and coke. He was crazy. He really, very excited. Woo! Boy. How about drugs? I don't know what to get him. How about, um, eggmog? 560, 50560. You know, I want to make a statement to our sales department. Okay. And this message is very serious. Don't become an up here in these studios and the new Rogers studios. Ricken to buy drugs. Okay. That's my message to our sales department all over this building. I find it so demeaning and so gross test that there are people from our sales department from the sports sales people all that want to mention no names. But people all over this building come running around here thinking that we're like a bunch of drug peddlers up here. And we're not. No, I said we're not. Are we? Here's a motherland that will manage, hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I don't know. Maybe you might be your father. The pants is a loser. Yeah. I have a message about the campus swimming for you. Have you been wearing them? What are you talking about, sir? I gave you a sweater, pant of sweater down here to similar reservation. Yeah. Have you been wearing it? Yeah. I'm wearing it right now. Good. Well, that's probably it. Yeah. Okay. Thanks. Thanks for the good news. Oh, God. Like I said, the lifeless, the desperate. These people aren't homeless. They're beyond homeless. They're lifeless. This is 560. You a. I have no right. You're the deep dark drugs boys of Washington. You're the one man fit his way to the top of the political food chain. I'm the tank. The lion can. I'm going to do something about him to raise. Really? Walt Disney productions combine 60 years of cartoon history. The two years of political ineptitude to give you a story. We know all too well. Now, there's go to bayonets. Everybody. Talk well. The lion can. With music by Elton John. Same old song and dance by Bill Clinton. There was nothing to roll and my water goes.

He's working the board today. Joe. He's such an asshole. Okay. Great. Well, I'm telling you, said so. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. Out of town line is open of course, eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, five, sixty, three, forty, five. He said you're an asshole, Joe. Here's a mobile in Fort Waterdale, hello. You, yes, sir. The social conversation with the here about the Panthers for a minute. Yeah. I'm listening a little bit to the first team this morning and I'm hearing that. Like that would be sensible. Well, yeah, I know. I'll look at that little show on there on the first team that defending, you know, our little boy there at the Panthers, about that article that was written. It just makes me feel like I was about 10 minutes until 10. And Joe turned the amount of the website. I had to listen to the last few minutes of their show. And when I heard him start doing that, I was in there pounding on the window to their studio. That's off of them. Well, you, you missed the garbage. I was screwed around, 90 in or something like that. We, we eat 30 in when he went off on the whole article. But, you know, I thought it was a good article. I thought it was about the first time that any of our sports people writers in this town showed a little balls. Yeah, I mean, everybody that knows anything about hockey knows that it's time for the Murrays to have their, you know, walking papers handed to him. And that, really should get to get the hell out of town too. There are coaches getting fired in league every week their guys getting canned. Including, including crad Ramsian fillet of the flyers at 30 points before they fired him and brought in Bill Bower and he still got canned. And these guys have got a license to steal forever until Wayne makes his deal. Well, let me ask you, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me, let me. What is this, what the, you know, what the, you know, what the team, I mean he does that little pit thing on the, uh, panther hockey, you know, game night or whatever. He's an employee, he gets paid by them and as we go, he's under a lot of pressure and, uh, believe me, that organization. If you work for them in any way, shape or form and you look at them cross riders say just the wrong thing, they're all over you like, stick on Wayne. So then you understand why he takes the stance where he does that something needs to be done. And then why does he just keep his mouth shut? Why does he go on a tack Michael Mayore where, you know, defend it effectively. He just keeps his mouth shut. That's, that's why I took exception to it. If you could say that, then he needs to say the obvious about, you know, what the story is with the coaching staff. All right, you know. Okay, hold your breath. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT and T line. Free ticket, baby. Not, what are you laughing about? Just because Greg Reed isn't listening to the show and it's totally out of the loop as usual has no idea what's going on here today. And brought me in these free tickets. He was trying to do something nice. He says, hey, it's your team, the least right up against the glass. When I said, no, you up against the glass on the way out as well as said. And he did he back right into the glass. Like a clutch with an expensive traded out suit. 560, 50560 pound 560 on the AT. What are you giving those numbers out again? Because it's the holidays.

Well, what can we do to replace them? What do you mean by that? I mean, we got to have something for a moment. You get sick or something. You know, you're just going to be doing the show? That's right. How about the auto racing show with Joe Costello? No. No. Bad idea. How about the tapes about Grant? How about Bill Mesar does topics? Huh? Talk radio, coast to coast. Yeah, let's just open up the Potton Pots and Civicator crap on there. Let's have Tony Bruno laugh. I can hire you from ESPN radio. They are on laughing gas. They're at ESPN radio.

holiday season five six seven like i said zero five sixty save it punk back in a sack with your brother jack here's a mobile in Miami hello hey you know how you do it okay you know i've always respected your opinion um on a good piece of meat but i got to tell you i was real disappointed i was just in Vegas a few weeks ago and i was staying at the Venetian which is right next to the rosewood grilla uh did you know i've never talked about this place let me give it a shot yeah that was one of the worst stakes i've ever had well i haven't eaten there in years maybe they gone downhill i never had anybody over the years complain everybody i've ever talked you said that it's great that they loved it they were expensive but that it was sensational so yeah it's funny you know i usually get a bad piece of meat anywhere yeah but you know it's funny the guy the way that came over and it's the very knowledgeable he said that he used to work at roots Chris which i happen to love i know you like roots yes i do in fact they have two of the best roots Chris in the world of Vegas yeah and for i figured i'm not gonna go to roots Chris i can get it down here Miami right um and he said he used to work there and and he says let me tell you you quite honestly these stakes are much better than roots Chris at that one i'm salivating yeah and he comes over brings a piece of meat that i wouldn't i would have brought back at the outback yeah that's that's the third time you're said that already and i'll say it again you can get a bad piece of meat anywhere yeah but besides everything else was great Vegas okay great thanks to report there's another bit for Vegas was great except you got a bad piece of meat Joe anybody and i'm gonna make a rule right now since it's almost been a year we use resolution on the show i don't want to hear about Vegas ever again i'm a program ever ever ever i know it's great i know it's fun i know that that's take how she's talking about happens to be a very good place Rosa did you ever eat there now two expensive for you Rosa would grow great seafood gigantic huge lobster's very high price but nevertheless some of you got a bad piece of meat there not interesting sir it is not interesting it is as useless as taking a crap in the middle of a highway meaningless useless there isn't one person in the audience who just benefited in the least bit was entertained on news anything from that conversation but they'll keep the kitchen good time oh god yeah just got back from Vegas we had a great time now good drop the postcard here's a mobile in Miami hello yes sir good afternoon for how are you great kind of nervous i'm gonna call your show before never listen for a long time i have a couple of comments to make your own back earlier or speaking about this stadium when i was overclap my wife is a third-rate teacher yeah and it is a shame i mean it's it's beyond belief and it's it's unbelievable that here these people want to build this small pie millionaire a new toy basically a sandbox and in the meantime our children are going to school and portable so you don't understand all for now it is not unbelievable because the people here don't all say what i said earlier in a show and i'm i'm right the people in this state and in this area don't care about education because if they did that wouldn't be going on right now it didn't care beyond like i don't know i i don't know what it is my wife and you can contact or speak to any public school teacher and i would tell you that you won't find one of them that will tell you that they don't spend at least 200 to 250 dollars out of their own pockets yeah every year for supplies for the kids yeah and then and then i agree with you but you can't change the public you can't force feed them they don't care they don't give a crime it is it is it is it's not an it's beyond rationale i know it's America for you man unreal we can find all of money in the world for stadiums and arinos and the billionaires and trillionaires sport and people with jack steps but when it comes to taking care of your kid when it comes to educating him uh protecting him whatever nobody cares it's forget it and then another thing that um it gets it i don't know it's i come to see what's it done like uh out you know whatever happened that are sunshine law thing i come and wasn't put up to a vote because it wasn't because i'm about county let me say it again so because it's in big county well whatever it's keep for okay have a great day sir five family say it again it wasn't just cubans the anglers who bothered showing up to vote the sparlan at election back in September the majority of them also voted for mayor pinga pecania so even these anglers you wanted cubans sir but the fact is that the majority of all the people of Odin day county voted for mayor pinga pecania for one of the most notorious con artist and quicks whoever docking our place are joint oh she talking about drugs again yeah so let me give a message to ourselves department i don't know what you're reacting like that for Joe weed with this is not an egg nags stand we don't saw egg nags here you're not supposed to talk about about one right huh about the fact that they keep coming up here looking for drugs now no look at what what just happened there what what all was that what was what what you do the phone just magically i was just i had my thumb on it and it vanished here's what an order deal hello hey new happy holiday and to you all right hey we're talking to the experts i've had here today boy i'm going to have a look at it hey we're the case of you know we're still over all of the dinner uh last night yeah and uh you know the comments came up about different talk show host and really i must have been a sentencing conversation yeah actually the why i think i'm actually turned into a some i even conversation over who was the best and uh you know i have the chance to my work involves me driving around every day front throughout the tricani area and i do i tried i can i listen to everybody here and there but one of the things that i realized last night was talking to everybody was that uh over the last few months when everything was going gone gone on i've really learned to respect you and in your show i guess more so you didn't send the show and so because you you put some thoughts in my mind especially over the last 35 days of the election and everything that uh you know like one of the things you said was hey we're all not getting over and so we got a good one x4 you that we just gone out to get along and we'll make it through the next four years and then just that one little thing you said right there to sop in the and they be responsible for what we need to do so that's what we need to do so that a difficult to copy in other words is there any point in getting all psychotic and crazy about it or you know that you do that we can do that you do the best we can that's right because you need to uh not see the attorney general the country there's no reason to get upset about that well just like you said we got to get along and we'll make it i mean we've made it through worse that's right you know regardless of what happened is who stole what and who's doing what and just remember if they think this guy is stupid remember drill 40 makes this guy look like Einstein right i should have him hey you know what it should make a soft smart it is should make a soft smarter people you know for those of us that say they don't realize what took place or well that we're just whining and if you've been listening today they weren't working yet maybe you know there's a lot of small more come blade reaction yeah okay let me ask you quick question

comments on him can I check him about one are you gonna know I mean what do you think about him as a commentator he's not a commentator he belongs under like my little dog belongs I mean he doesn't belong in those games do you think he's gonna know I know that he's gonna call him or a kid if they have any brains at all they'd they'll say goodbye now good leave and don't hurry back so that's the door to the yes yeah I agree I'm gonna want okay but there's nothing more than as you notice from today show from all these colors there's nothing worse than somebody trying desperately to be funny who's not and the fact that we got to be sporced nerds on here so many of them like debating all all as he did he didn't bother me that much he isn't wrong there he's a piece of crap he's a deterrent he is a detriment to the enjoyment of those telecast even when I have a great game like the Tampa Bay game and saying the list last week he is a detriment he's this piece of scum on the face of the earth and he's no done sure would can't remind me more of a British or what sure none now in Sherman here's a lady mobile in Miami hello yes man I'm I am actually a second generation all one time let's review and I recently bought eight months ago moved out of South Florida and I'm making it back to visit my parents but I have to tell you it is so refreshing to be reinforced at why you leave South Florida right and this show that's what we're years that's the purpose we should have here I mean it's it's I'm the leave of all yeah ignorance here is un-missed of all and I really think it's exemplified you know during the holidays these I'm out in the shopping mall and my friend and I on the car and I see this truck and it's literally gonna hit us and we beat all of it and the sky y'all got the windows so I'm gonna get it whatever yeah yeah yeah I mean you know people here are just just grateful and and another thing and I guess I'm just trying to get you to some amy radio listening up in Atlanta no one really said it like you and I know I missed this whole election thing here in South Florida state thought to do so humiliating to even be part of the holiday but not surprising no huh you know it's really not surprising I have to tell you I even came down for a Thanksgiving around like oh we're gonna go and have some boats I mean it's just a delicious yeah the the type of reputation we have across the country but you know I think you're really now that this morning and I know you don't want to go over the election again but just so many more reasons as to why it went down the way it did and when you mentioned don't even even in closet anti-cinuit acts and anyone who wouldn't so that would be a reason it's just another again. It's not politically correct you just don't say those things because we're supposedly the goody two shoes media approach that everybody is broad minded and we don't have that anymore and y'all got it all so the bull crap and of course at nonsense girl lost every single state in the South including Florida and the fact that he had a not just a jubilee five bitch in the out of the closet you were on his sleeve like you were leaving and on the ticket with them there wasn't a chance in hell he was gonna win those states. It's very sad commentary. It was like an invitation to lose any did. Well I think the saddest part is that how little time the dad particular subject got they would rather spend more time on ballots and on stupidity rather than really facing some some deep issues that they were going to get the truth from the American media. I'll be a sugarcoat everything and make sure that whatever they say is politically correct. Well anyway just wanted to say like I said second generation a long time listener always wanted to call you I'm leaving out to go back to Lama tonight the hot thing helping me here. You know keep on listening. Okay don't come back to us since we are it's better your mental health. Okay. Good luck. Bye bye. How do you like that? The people who are from out of town are the people who got out of here and are just coming back visiting those little ones who make sense today. The right for the people who move the movement like that as usual as usual. How do you like that? And see people like that leave the area. She sounds like a sweet of it and she sounds like an ice person. Yeah. Like like a living and breathing person with a brain bigger than a ring finger. I have those tickets. Play with those tickets. And you'll notice not one single call of support. Not one person. I'm supposed to be Mr. Hockey Mapin wasting a lot of time against my better interest talking this crap on here and it's all about not one person calling you know what you're right. I'm not going to waste one more minute of my time even if I bought my tickets already subsidizing that crap until until they do something. So don't think we're going there belly aching and bitching about it because you're part of the problem to fact that even a respectable number of people continue showing up that's why they can throw you away with it because you're a man's a kiss. An addition to which about 80% of people are there in the first place aren't there to see a game anyway. They're just there as a social event to shmrews because they have no life because they want to get on their self-formancy if they can impress you because they're a bunch of plastic assholes. That's why about 80% of those people are in that building. Plastic assholes. Those are the ones who get up and front of you and they're walking back and forth and they're up and down the aisle. Oh you don't really want to see the game do you? What do you love set about? Am I in your right? You know that's the best thing about watching a game on TV in my house. Nobody gets up and stands in my way when I want to see the game. I'm going to draw your breath for a beautiful face out for all of us. It's time for a million dollars to the economy. You can get a little breath. Oh you got to do it with fake clothes attention to this poorly written copy. That's part of the fun. Figure out what we're desperately trying to say and get. That's right. Come and write here and surfboard. What up, then or whatever and it is now. I shouldn't have to do with that act. With good things you will get. The night at a billions of dollars to the economy and you know what that means? More empty stadium. One thing we know for sure. It must be about some kind of weird spotting for some of the thermostat drunken sport-hols can understand what we're talking about. That's it. That's right. Do something now and go wherever it is because it's so bad. What is it again? What's 31 at 5.50 WQAM and they got an office shooting in Wakefield, Massachusetts, on CNN right now. That's the American fucking way. Some of you are glad for a Glenn from Miramar who's a first asshole color in the day out of a long list of many. You will not get gun nuts out. I'm glad that this tremendous pull-offer proliferation of guns all over America so that you can have a lot more of these stories to keep MSNBC and CNN in business. Here's a call in the redland. Hello. Good afternoon sir. How are you? I'm glad you had a great weekend away from here. It's a fantastic. I don't know how much a Friday show you caught at the George Circuit. Just on the way to the airport. That was a best show ever. Really? It was great. And what did you do? He was just playing all kinds of bits. Well that's what I do. Really old stuff. You were playing a lot of Christmas stuff. I didn't know you had that much Christmas stuff. Yeah, I heard what he said. He said that I played all of Christmas stuff. Yeah, I did. I got no dummy. What did you found a couple of them? Yeah, like a CD for just for Christmas next year. Oh yeah. Please make extra dope. You're right. There you go. So they can download that one too from next year. Oh, gee, you didn't think about that. I don't download that by it. Well, I've got bless you. And I win the other 10 people. One thing I want to call you about is I got my wife turned on the manage now. Yeah. And that woman called a month or so ago. She was talking about she turns with TV down and turns her radio up. Sure. So Saturday, the game came on and was raining and crappy. And my wife flipped the dolphin thing on. And Sunday. Sunday. Sunday. Where did they go? Yeah, Sunday, right? One of those days. One of those days it was crappy anyway. Oh, and the God. And so she's with the game comes on and she's just clicked. Turn later on. Sure. And we laughed all afternoon. I'll call the old damn game man. That guy's the greatest. He is. He's underrated. I'll tell you that. Well, he's smart enough though to have his own business though. You don't need radio. That's good point. He's like any time. Where is he? Yeah. Well, good luck to you. Okay. Thanks, I'll see you. Bye bye. And now what made it said he needs like any temporary something like that. Whatever that. And no walk yet, Jim. Now he's still locked in the closet down there. Yeah, Jim, I just will try to get out of his closet between 6 and 10 and a PM that I went after Hank. Get him out of there so we can both camp and roll about 15 rounds, 12 on. I hope you think we would win that fight. Huh? I mean, maybe it's just a pretty tough customer, but but I think that is being like a Peter World tie. Don't need fight, you know, where Kimba is just like pounding like straight down on top of his head plus those got like 10 years on him. 10 years in from what I'm here in 10 inches. In height. Here's sunrise. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Happy new year, Neil. And back when I go back to the I I a whole little day, that's all I've been listening to years. Yeah. I just want to let you know. I went through the registry hotel, not knowing that Mr. Hypinga owns that establishment now. I have family reunion over the weekend and what a rip off. Seven dollars for two copies out of the ice cream store in the morning because I got down the lobby before the dining room was open. Nice. How long time's it up, man? Times of any tight. I'm under the $30 to play the Naples Grand Hotel. Uh-huh. The golf course that is. $30, but anyway, thought that I can't afford it. It's just that I don't like getting ripped off. Anyway, can I leave you with a little faster? I was a I'm from Toronto. I've been here for 22 years. I was in the Carl's Street flat many, many evenings just like you have been. Can I leave you with a little faster here with? Yes. Hello, Canada and hockey fans from the United States. This is faster here with talking to you from the Donner or Maple Leaf Gardens were tonight. The Detroit Red Wings and the Pearson Police son of Amolansy and how we'll try and match strides with Mike Mahalich clear the track here come shopping, baby T on. That's it, I'm out. 18 remaining in the second series. Here's the head. Five to put a little on already. Will you I'll put the lid back on him put it back in the box. Five six seven four. Are they cranking all of a sudden down the hall at power 96 and a half? Are they going nuts around all of a sudden on an over? Just started cranking. You can feel like I had him walls ready to collapse in this joint must be done. Cox out of control again. Here's the mobile info waterdale. Hello. Hey, Doc. What is it? Hello. Mobile info waterdale. Okay, another more on here's the mobile of West Palm. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. I have a question. You know, but do you have a problem with people that don't know about how he going into hockey games? Yes. Why? Why would you go there if you don't know anything of you? I understand it. You'll want to see the game. Well, I'll be the best. That's the main reason that you want to go. So you want to learn about it. Then how can you learn about it? How can you learn about it? How can you learn about it by wandering around in a hall or who can the game is on? Well, that's different. Uh-huh. But just sitting on your suit that doesn't mean that you know, just be quiet there and watch the game or whatever. Be quiet. I watch the game, yeah. I mean, I can't see the problem. I'll see the reason. You don't have to be, uh, I just want to let you know. What did I just get to you saying? Which words didn't come from a company? Which word didn't you understand? Well, that five six seven over five sixty. The word you didn't understand, I think was you. Was that one? Here's the mobile and west palm. Hello. No. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Okay. You know what the path is up to every monument, they remind me of the leaps of the 80s. I'm originally from Toronto and the eight-year-old, Howard Days is the same as the High Zingat Days here. Uh-huh. But so I'm, I was not just hit path, who came back from Toronto and we're actually going to go to the game on Saturday because we can't find the ticket and Toronto to get to the game. So we're going to put our leafters on and go down on Saturday. Have a good time. What the other probably five thousand leaf fans that are going to be there. Their guys make it a hundred grand a year outside the air Canada Center, scalping tickets this year. The five hundred and some odd standing room only for every home game. Exactly. So, what does no hockey here? There's no, no passion for the game. No, because you'll have a good time and that's what that'll be it. There's no passion in the first place, then you compound that with the fact that you got an owner. It's basically doesn't give a crap just waiting to make a sale and these people, uh, and then nobody hears what to make a purpose. They don't give a crap. They didn't do it in Toronto either. The 80s, the dollar was, uh, But they don't compare this with Toronto. The reason they didn't do it is because the people there are, they could just read and eat it. You know that as well as I do. Doctor, where's the comparison? Well, I guess similar, but anyway, the least good one, we'll see you on Saturday. Okay, pal. Good light. Nick Andrew problem. The head trip is you, I think. Anybody know who that is? No. Number nine. Five six seven five sixty, pomp five sixty on the AT&T and for lies somewhere, hey come on Neil, how about turn those hockey tickets? What do you say? Oh come on, bring these last twenty months in the last segment. Some poor crippled family out there, some bunch of bigger sloppers living out of the overpass and over the underpass. Somebody out there who's like, uh, living hand above, getting the floor splice of that watermelon. What do you say? No. What do you say, Joe? The new two millennium, they only should have talked about that today too because it's the new millennium coming. No, do that tomorrow. Piss him off again. It'll take place this new year's Eve, not last new year, dummy. What's this obsession with hockey? Margaret Joe. She had the back of the form of the one H.B.O.N. comedy central. An outside of a few sympathetic druggles. She still hasn't said anything for me. But now you can judge for yourself with Margaret Joe's latest rule. Look at the four of the cheek. Brother is the weirdest by far. He's very strange. He's 20. And he used to be a surfer, but now he's a born again Christian. You'll least tell them that I'm louder, you're material could be. Hi, mommy. I have said you're too deep. Oh god. Well stuff, but if you're into death on stage, there's plenty to choose from. Do your Korean parents feel ashamed that their daughter talked about what you talked about on stage? She's not attractive. She's not pretty. But as she put it, she's up the air. Good night, Lord. Some better last please. Margaret Joe, think of the four of the cheek. They'll do now in all circle case days.
