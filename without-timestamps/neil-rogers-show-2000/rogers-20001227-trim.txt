Now, Neil Rodgers on Sports Radio 560 QA. Black and lady. Black and lady. Black and lady. Talk like a lady. But I got wise. Well, the difference between the eyes, always there is a difference between the eyes. Oh, you shower with me with you said, I stopped you on my queen. But I know there's something funny, I saw the virgin Yorjins. She looked like a lady. Black and lady. Talk like a lady. But I got wise. Well, the queen of eyes, always there is a difference between the eyes. Hmm. You were my first lover, but how I was surprised. Not only do you have one, but you're not certain size. Boy, look to like a lady. What a lady. Talk like a lady. But I got wise. There are the difference between the eyes, always there is a difference between the eyes. What I make in the second day or what? They go on. They made a bad mistake taking those calls. Nobody here. We just got a ripper af left here in town. Why not? Why not? Am I going to do it again today? No, no. Or the mom? What do you think about the mom? No. No, no calls. I got a lot of great stuff. Haven't played that in a long time. I got some of these old best stuff things to play here today. Got a lot of stuff that I want to talk about. Lots of stuff to cover today. I just want to mention in passing David J. Neal and Michael Russo, pair of assholes. Real mate. No, they just assholes is what they are. In the pocket of the organization. I don't want to say that was Robert Greeper that's listed on you guys. Rip and me over there in practice in the morning. We're rip away guys. I love it. Because when I know that I'm really getting to, I know that I'm doing my job well. You're just about to rubbers stance right in a bunch of puff pieces. This is the only market in the world. Well, supposedly professional sports franchise could be due to the public. What the panties are doing to the people here. And they get a free pass. And Michael Mayaw writes one column that was actually pretty good. And he gets a little carried away talking about brewery, hitting material, and whatever. And right away, that's the only thing that they can see in the article. You guys are pathetic. You're a bunch of suckles. Which this town? Haven't I always said that this town is loaded with suckles. There's almost nobody in this town. We'll let it tell what like it is. Everybody wants to look you look you look you look you look you look you. I'm not going to do that on the show. I know she really look good. Bring it on. I'll let you know whether I'm going to look or not. Speaking of looking man, what is with you people on the roads? I mean, on a good day, on a perfect day here it's bad. At best. It's a nightmare. Even bluff was just to tell me. And I hastened to agree. I have never in my life. I've lived here 25 years. I've never seen anything like what I saw on the last 24 hours on the road chair. I've come to work the last two mornings. I'll grant you. It's nice. There's nobody here. Traffic is light. Get here in no time at all. But in the afternoon, go home yesterday. Everybody out there is like hitting the egg. Now I think. They're hitting. I'm sorry. They're still blind. You're drunk or whatever. They're just the drop and acid. Do magic mushrooms. They're your out of your minds. You're crazy people. It's not that there's a great vineyard traffic, but it's the ones who are out there. Nuts every single one of you are nuts. Mom, a turnpike trying to go home and it's like all jammed up. They're like going sideways and upside down and backwards. And the 5.95, the same thing going on yesterday. I made the badmust they go to publish last night just to pick up a couple of lighters. The sawgrass publics were the great people inside. But boy, what was going on outside? And it wasn't up to still with that chandop either. For the day after Christmas. I've seen the parking lot a lot fuller than that. But the people who were in there, they're like driving around in circles and like blocking everybody off. And what do I do now? Where do I go? And what gear do I put it in? Where do I stick it? Back home. Yeah. And I'm sitting in my car just screaming at the top of my lungs. Come on already. Somebody goes somewhere. I'd like to get home before midnight. This was six o'clock, you know. And I love to walk away. Something definitely to be said for getting the holidays over with. Fast, soon, real soon. Okay, here's our pool. Jason Robards is dead. I should mention that great actor. Do you know Jason Robards? No. Don't even know who the hell he was. Name something he was in. A boy in his dog with Diane Johnson. I'm into that because that might be one you'd know. No. Death of a salesman? No. What are the all-time greatest actors who ever lived? A drunk. But a great actor he's dead. Was he in any warm movies? No. If I'd not know that I know of. Who else died? Oh, over the way. What's his name? The penis. Victor Brogodide. Now you got to know who Victor Brogodide is. Oh yeah. You don't? No. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Woo! Okay. Jason Robards and Victor Brogod. And Joe Costello hasn't got any idea who either one of them more. That makes me very sad. Victor Brogod was the comedian who was a great piano player. But you all he never played. He always would pretend to play the piano today. He would threaten to play it. He played a few notes he'd fall down and do. He was a hysterical. But much before your time. He was about 140 years old. Old enough. He's dead. Here's our poor from yesterday. Not too big of a response because nobody's in town. In fact, a lot more I thought we'd get. Best of Neal tapes. Like the one that we played on Christmas day, which I all mean. You thought the show was bad yesterday, which it was. Thanks to you folks. I'm going to tell you. I'm still so embarrassed from that tape on Monday though. Those best of Neal tapes suck. They absolutely positively suck. And I don't care what our consultant says or what our general manager says. Anybody who thinks that they could survive a whole summer in this place. Playing those tapes every day. I come back here to be they be playing the reruns of the roadrunner here on a goddamn radio between 10 and 2 or B day. You have to be out of your mind. They're old. They're stale. They're outdated. And we're actually playing tapes. You want to talk about what today is December the 12th. Last time I checked it was Christmas day on Monday. But I'm driving home from the airport. No today's December the 12th. And I'm talking about stuff. Guess what? That was going on. September the 12th. Would the electorers and the election and there's still count in the ballot to wait for these Appreens and I mean who the hell in there right mind wants to hear that anymore? In fact that's you ought to be honest with the wasn't that we're hearing the first time. Based on what I heard of the tape and we're playing it again. Because it kills some time. It fills up four hours. And we can run from the spots in there. It's a spot holder. You've heard of a pot holder. We have shows that are spot holders. And if you don't believe me at 345 the staff I still can't believe this. I realize it's the holidays. But we have to be kidding. I was all excited because I see the mad dog is on in prime time. I heard a little bit of them in the car last night. Thanks for the guy who had mad dog. Had good things to say about me. About the big gorilla as he calls me. But at any rate he's on today at two. Hank Scott a few days off here for the holidays. But he's only until 345 the mad dog. Why? Why do we have a 345 hurricane warm up? And what do we have at 4.0. Hurricane basketball. Not just any hurricane basketball game. They're playing the Lehigh Mountain Hawk at 4 o'clock this afternoon. Did you know what the nickname of? You don't know Victor Brugger and Jason Robards. Please don't tell me you knew the nickname of Lehigh. No. The Mountain Hawk didn't know it. I think they're kind of the chicken hawks. The Lehigh Mountain Hawk at the ULM Hurricanes. I guarantee there'll be more people at that game than there will be listening. And you know how many people are going to be attending that game this afternoon? Behind. Yeah. Pops. That's an optimistic view there'll be behind people in the stands. Which is probably 3 times more than the ones who'll be listening. But it's, you know, we'll get some spots under in the game. It's a spot holder. That's all we care about. Just get the spots on. Like now. 9 minutes after 10 at 5. 60. What are you laughing about? That's all we're here for. To get the spots on. That's all we're here. Why do we play those best-in-neal tips? We know they suck all you ever hear the porous off. They're okay once in a while. 264. They suck, which is what I voted 162. They're my favorite when he wasn't there. 149. Which means that out of the 575 votes we hit, 149 people must hate George O'Rot. Because to say that they like to teach that that's their favorite one on that here. That's saying a lot. George. And don't drink too much eggnog this week. 10 out of 10 to 10 at 5. 60. No question of the frozen maybe. We could be. No. Trust written permission. W2AN. Beacon by ten. Group Incorporated. This base stands for nothing. Alright, let's play who wants to be a millionaire. Top daddy. Sitting in the chair. I'll call you a puppy. Yo yo man yo yo. Are you ready? Yeah. Here's your $100 question. Finish this nursery right. Alright. Hickory, Dickory. Blank.

Alright, who are we going to call puppy? Oh my boy. Oh dirty bastard. Old dirty bastard. Yeah, dirty we call him. Our friends from AT&T will get old dirty on the line. And hopefully he can help you. Oh. Yo. Old dirty. Yeah man. We just filled in from who wants to be a million air. How are you? I got your friend here. Puff Daddy. Don't dirty. What's that? Oh my god. Oh my god. What's that? Alright. Oh. What's that? Old dirty. Puff Daddy's in a little bit of trouble here on the hundred dollar question. He's the first time man. First question. And the next voice you hear will be his. He'll come on the line. How ask you the question. They'll give you four possible choices. So you said. Hey man. Next voice you hear will be his. And 30 seconds begins now. What? You dirty.

We are on the hundred dollar question. You know what we just want to pull the audience? No. I like to add a lot of land. Actually, no. There's only three lifelines you've used. One you have to land. No, no. I get another lot of land. It's a brand new one because of the game. And what is that, Puffy? It's called shoot the host. Puffy, you can ask the audience. I call it shoot the host. Puffy, you're 50-50. What's he asking? Puffy, it's stuck. It's a-a-a. It's stuck. My final answer is stuck. It's stuck. And it's a good one. You got a home in all it. What are you running away for? Stop it. I'm running away. Stop it. That's 17 at 5.60. Lots of good stuff. We're going to be here in today tomorrow. Friday. And all day. Great stuff. Stuff you haven't heard it a long time. Stuff that you might want to hear actually getting some day. But in the meantime, great column by Max J. Castro. In the hero of on the off-ed page there. I'm not going to read it. It's too long. Ponderous to sit here and read. You'll pop up, especially in the holidays. But I just bring it to your attention. You're going to want to read it. Stuff stadium. And it just starts out by saying to those who are trying to sell us the idea that my Miss Future hinges on the Marlins and the sweetheart deal that provides jobs of public money to build a stadium so that they promise to stay here. Cities are great because of fine museums. Good libraries. Beautiful parks and vibrant neighborhoods. Cities become great because of their culture. They're urban soul in the spirit of the people. Cities are not made great by their ball themes or their ball parks. It goes on at great length. Nice going. Max J. Castro who's one of the few columnists in this town who want to regular basis makes a lot of sense all the time. Airbee column he writes that I can recall is right on target. Even during the early on days, he takes a lot of heat and a lot of crap from the militant to old green to Cuban community. But he makes a lot of sense and he's got a big pair. Which find anybody who does either with those in this town makes sense and has a big pair is like looking for a needle in the haystack. See I don't want to dwell on it because it's depressing but this town just attracts so many losers. Like doctors. Look at all the bad doctors we have here. I mean, trying to find a good doctor here like I said like looking for a needle in a haystack in the ocean. Stockbrokers. See your snicker and I'm that's one of my new years where's the loons. I'm not going to make a lot of stupid resolutions that I can't keep but one I am going to make is that during the month of January very very soon. I'm going to find the real financial planner. Somebody that's not obsessed with the same one to mention the role crap. I mean, if I would have a broker that bought me a stock called Askedives at 120 bucks a share. And there's now like two dollars a share today and on the verge of going belly up. I'd have to wonder if this man had his head on straight. Not to mention of course the ones that he did by me like shookrich and this TV and all the other director that this man is obsessed with. And I want to talk about the stock market. I was told in Joe this morning the fact is that during this last year is the zacres has been health care stocks and mutual funds. Energy natural gas other forms of energy. Reats. All there are but all kinds of things where people have made money. Not everybody lost their ass. But when you're dealing with somebody who's just a generic stock broker who's one dimensional who will eat those one thing and keeps repeating the same mistakes over and over again. You're not dealing with anybody who wants to trust your money to Mitch. You're dealing with a loser. Those kind of guys are a dime a dozen. Now I'm going to embark upon finding somebody because down here like I said everybody's a pitchman. Everybody's they're hyping in there. They're hustling and like that idiot at the hockey games. The hustler. Oh yeah, we're going to do this. So we're going to do that. We got so many billion dollars locked up the money. And if you're doing so great, how come you're hustling me like you're desperate for my money? I don't get it. Oh, it's bigger those hockey games. Am I going to be going tonight? Oh, see, I come on yesterday. And I made a statement which I thought was again pretty gutsy and pretty on target. And should have been a good ol' object lesson. A lot of people out there instead of being suckers the rest of your lives. And I get one call on it from some greasy old fart in a hell and Dale. Some disgusting miserable old piece of direct, which hell and Dale is loaded with which they specialize in. You're a hypocrite. Bye-bye. Yeah. You don't even know the meaning of the words. So you're an old disgusting jackass. You're pathetic. You're what's wrong with this town. All I said was that I'm not going to be going any more of those games. I'm going to the game when my team, the Toronto Maple Leafs, play here on Saturday. And yes, they lost another girls team last night. It wouldn't make any difference. If they lost every game, I've been a fan for 42 years. I'm a real fan. I live and die with Toronto Maple Leafs. Which is no matter what sport you like you're assuming you like any of them. That's what a real fan is all about. But what's happening with the Panthers isn't going to anything do with living and dying with a team. There's no effort. There's no effort by having to players or more. There's no effort by the organization. We have a white wash going on by the media. All of a sudden have a lot of yaw and can't open up their mouth and are pissed off at me. Because on the one person in town, it's got the balls to tell what like it is. It's not just the fact that they play 35 games and they want only six. It's the fact that the product that they're putting on a front of the people is an embarrassment. They had to be giving refunds after those games. That's not having a good time to go see a lackluster on effort and keep reading the stupid puff pieces in newspaper about Terrey Murray is like a George Stephanopoulos. He's becoming a real philosopher and he's up to the 4 in the morning wondering about this. He's wondering all right, when the hell the guy damn sure is going to drop, the way the hell he's going to wind up screwing things up next. Which can't happen soon enough. I mean, how stupid can people be that when the people belly I can about wane and about John Henry and rightfully so, but what do you keep subsidizing them for? Why do you keep lending them your tangible support? When saying the best analogy would be I was telling this to Duff before the show. You went into a restaurant, they even go in two for years. And you really enjoyed going there. Not a place with like greasy cool cuts like that one place, but I'm talking about a real good restaurant. Oh, y'all get to them. I'm going to rip them and ask that a too. Have D-Foke at butchered up to and I I salute D-Foke man. He's grown a small pair. Joe Rose is working on him and he's finally getting D-Foke to grow a small pair. Even rip those chronic guys. It's like a fracking five monster. He invented it now he's destroying it. Nice going D-Foke. You suck whole. But anyway, let's say there was a restaurant you really enjoyed going to. And the food was delicious and the service was great and they were friendly. You'd always had a good time there and the prices were reasonable. And then all of a sudden the quality of the food started going down. And the prices kept going up and up and up and the service they just threw the food at you. And they treated you like crap like hey don't bother me. I'm busy reading the book. And finally one day you went to the manager and you said you haven't come in here for years and I really used to enjoy it here. But lately the food is crap. The prices are ridiculous and the services in different bed and rude. And they said well where the prices of song are restaurant. And when we find a new owner then the food will be good again and the service will be great and then the prices will be more reasonable. Now let me ask you is there any person in his right mind who would go back and eat and that restaurant again until they serve the restaurant. You know you're using places under new management you know okay fine I'll give him a chance. But if you knew that that was their attitude is there any chance that any sane person would go back absolutely not. And that's why I'm not going to be going to any of those games except when the Toronto Maple Leafs are here I'm going to be rooting for them like I always look as that's my team I'm a fan of that team and that organization and we have plenty of dreadful years up there but the fact is that's the team I'm a fan of. How can you be a fan of this of what's going on here of the slap in the face routine that goes on in every couple of nights. It's not fun it's not entertaining and like I said yesterday to sit around in a bitch session before the game and in between period with a bunch of the same people. I'm not saying that people some of them are nice people and they're hoping for the best but they're naive. If that's the best they can do with their lives is to put on their silly little you know they're their sweaters and go to sit there and pretend that they're having a good time good luck to you find a life. Go out and hold up a seven eleven do something exciting. Go to some egg nog. But that's not excitement that's not entertainment. So if you are with tag me if I'm the villain or this I'm not the one that's taken your money. I'm not the one that's sticking a two in saying oh well I'm not going to do anything with improvement until it's good for me. That's worthy that's the man that's stuck with his freaking marlin that's the same guy that's doing it to you with his panthers and that's the same guy that will always do it to he's the same guy that he was brought to the left us to the right that the blockbuster park not. That's why we're in a this thing about a stadium now because that was another line along a list of lives. Oh yeah remember blockbuster park and we were going to have a stout to dome stadium and the dolphins were going to play in a football stadium in the mall and we're going to play in the baseball stadium and we're going to have a world class Olympic training track and all these things didn't happen. Oh no and why didn't it happen because Wayne decided that it was time to take his $2 billion whatever the hell in his blockbuster stock and make that two flags it on TV with the crocodile tears running down his cheeks. Wayne Hizinga can take his blockbuster stock. He can take his Miami dolphins. He can take his Florida Panthers. He can take all of his crocodile tears as far as I'm concerned and stick them all way up in his ass. He's not going to get another dying on my money under any circumstances. I'm going to speak in my own soda Saturday night when the elite game is on. I'm going to invite a guy named Sotus. You can stuff it right up your ass because the way that you troops a public the way you slap people in the face and you still like I said got these stupid people keep coming back for more. I don't get it. I'm not understanding how I've been at stupid. It's taken me this long. I realized it's a pretty boring place down here but Jesus even even just going to the track and losing 100 bucks is going to be a lot more fun than go ahead and see in that crap again. And the excuses and the bull crap and the stories and these cover up guys and all these little bush league minor league kids writing this garbage in the newspapers puff pieces. And then said. So you guys can be pissed off and me over there and then bother me when we do the first time be pissed off all you want. I take it as a high compliment. I must be saying the right things. I'm looking at the mirror and see the soil that you guys are writing in your newspapers. What are supposed to be real major market newspapers. What a pair of shows you guys are. And how about the rest of these guys. Dave Hyde and Dave Joseph and Eddie the purpose of all these other words. Where's their common. When they're going to open up a mouth and say something. They got lots of. Because certain people in this time like Wayne Hypinger they get a free pass. They can do no wrong. And like I said, pass rhymes with stick it up your ass Wayne and have a good time doing it. 27 after 10 at 5.60 WQ and. It was almost Saturday morning and it exactly man. Oh, more. But nothing to the prepared. And I'm not done badly. 4. He was proud. He was going to be in the happy weather. He was just about to put a cat in due to my crowing. I am using the bathroom and in city. He was reading the technical. He is under there. I looked above the toilet where the towels used to be. And there was things that grew today. So they'd throw all they see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I didn't see. I the one thing. I didn't圓 you figure out how many things I should take. Why didn't you figure out? I didn't see where. They're nothing but gifts. Thankfully. Most of the week. Thank God. I went. Walla for people to show yesterday. I wouldn't do the Weine high like one gigantic bowel movement. Because I'm frustrated by a lot of things. A lot of them being the fact that we really are raising the kind of money with these charity campaigns anymore like we used them. Of course we're not at the old station anymore, we're over here. And we don't really get enough of a lot of cooperation here. We don't get a lot of involvement. But that's the understanding of the century. It used to be kind of like a station campaign. And I would say here it's like, well, that's Neil on his island over there. Maybe a few of us will assume we're going to check for whatever that stupid charity might be this year. But I'll have to let him screw him. And then of course we also had the added dimension of the fact that all the punks out there now are downloading from Napster and also burning copies of the CDs. So try to sell CDs to raise money for charity is a fruitless effort at this point. Miguel is working on getting a satautal which she ever had he did a day at a mall. And of course the thing continues through the 31st to Sunday. And you can buy your best of Neil CDs and cassettes still inspects. But we'll be lucky to raise 80 grand. I would say it. I'm that's my estimate, my best guess. I've looked 10 grand as the money I had the seed money I put in there in the beginning. So you're talking about really raising about $70,000 in an area of 4 million people. Not all I could. Not that great. And of course if George were here this week which he's not his busy home drinking egg none but if he were here we could have that same argument again about the key change and if we had a lot more of them we'd have raised a lot more money because we have that same argument again. And it wouldn't be any point because you know if I talk to my mother I'm talking he's not listening. I'm talking to a rock. So I pull a question today. Should Neil bother with charity campaigns anymore? Now what do you what is the look? Give me a look. I just didn't know you were going to do it today. Why? You haven't mentioned it. Today's as good as any. Should Neil bother with charity campaigns anymore? Yes? No or I don't give a shmit. Those are your three choices. I mean nobody listens to their show because they care about the CDs or they you know and nobody listens for that reason. And when you're really stopping figure out for example I'm looking at the where's the number? Where now the go Eric? One moment please. What else? The number on the order. Or to 703 on our website on urg.com. 703. Now stop and figure out when you consider the fact that we have people listening in New York and in Detroit and in even in other countries not a whole lot but you know isolated here when they're in Phoenix. 703 on the internet when you're all over the world that's not a resounding number. In fact I'll guarantee that more than 703 people have downloaded the stuff from Napster and still in it free than came up with a 20 bucks per plan per month. Going to you. No contest. How much of it do you think is actually on Napster? I mean how many of the bits could possibly be on there? Or even if it's not on Napster just to burn the copy of their friends for free which everybody in their brother now getting the I got one of those. Remember the day I got a year to go the CD burner it's great. Oh yeah I got all kind of stuff that I you know make my own CDs. I'll like rate European music that nobody here wants to hear but I'm gonna play some of the anyway. But anyway because you look you seem so depressed about this which I have no idea why. We can still have a free meal at the pizza loft so I understand that. Yeah we're getting free lunch from my an hour today. You got a nice little tradition going. Yeah for many many years and people love the CDs and the key change even more than why I start but we did while we did stop for the one year and that was the year that was in limbo even though I already signed a contract to come over here and these people didn't want to do it why didn't they want to do it because the main reason being that they were afraid they'd have to put up the CD money and be in the cheap clicks that they aren't always I have a trouble finding two nickels to rub together didn't want to do that. In addition to which what it comes to promotion it's not a never vocabulary don't you understand that after all time you've been here it's not a never vocabulary they don't know what that means. It's not existing to them. Do you know what our promotional budget is? What is it? You really don't know I want you to ask during the next break I want you to go in and ask Miguel what the promotional budget is for his department he's the promotion or I don't know what his title is today but he's in charge and find out what our monthly promotion budget you guarantee you will pay in your pants you'll have to put on the pens. For a company that's listed on the NASDAQ on the stock exchange which house that stock doing these days. Yeah by me I didn't say it's doing great. Doing better than zero oxygen as you put together which is pretty scary much. Yeah we don't have any complaints it's not an our vocabulary if not something these people are interested in doing people come to like when we used to do the appearances oh where's there's a bumper stickers? Oh yeah bumper stickers. And you just laugh you just laugh right out loud because of course we don't believe in those things we don't do that stuff. Yeah but you're your big time you don't need promotion right? Oh yeah right. Anyway here's the question since Joe is just the dead set against the my asking this but I will anyway should you bother with charity campaigns anymore yes no or I don't give a shipment those are three questions and whichever one you answer that's fine with me doesn't it doesn't pay me at least. And explain that that means no key chains no CDs. Right. Well let me answer something you think that anybody in the audience will stop listening because we don't have key chains you think that people will stop tuning in. Is that why people listen to the show so they let me ask you another question what percentage of the people are listening right now all 500 of them you think have the key chain. What percentage of the people listen to the show on a pretty regular basis ever donate a dollar or more to any of the charities we get involved with infinitesimally small. Now you were there at pizza loft the night we did our one fundraiser this year because we were not doing all that great and we're kind of desperate I didn't really want to do any and we raised a couple of grand which was nice and there were a lot of people showed up in place was packed online for three hours and you saw the crowd we had I would say I don't know how many there were a lot of people came by and on that crowd there were about 50% of the people were like you know one of the mill nice ordinary living and reading people and then there were I don't know what I'm trying to be kind how would you describe the other 50% of the people the other people. I mean what geeks would that be like a that would be complimentary wouldn't that Georgia call them frog would I be word geeks bearing gifts or bearing anything. So my point is that the groupies generally speaking those are the ones who are like in the this stuff you know the groupies having gone out in the van and met these people not the ones you're talking about the regular people they same pretty into it and happy to have these things available. Well we're fine now we're taking a pool I'm not I'm not pushing them in one direction of the other I like I said whatever they vote on that I'm open minded next year's next October is a long way off a lot of crap can happen between our October who knows the station to be slowly between our next October. Somebody might come along some Christian company could come along and buy the whole kind of outfit and pay me off and say here's a check for like a $4 million have a nice life I have a good kind of an accident. Yeah I mean I'm just thinking out loud you do understand then I'm not saying it's going to happen I'm just thinking to myself I'll listen to this the time of the year when people start hallucinating from too much egg not. Twenty before eleven and five sixty WQ I've had an annual while it's time to have fun leave the wife and kids at home this weekend and relax a little see a day airline with it to you to get up it will get laid daily why can't you have our 69 destination for special low prices right now. Most I want to give you that we give you a little t and a T and a airline because you're tired of masturbation. 1046 and 560 or so I guess that's so costilaw to curiosity what about those dolphin playoff tickets because they're a hankiest today and that's you know the fact that they they mail them regular mail last Thursday and then I even heard mad dog last night which why would he need tickets for the game when he broadcast the games. When you think you have like normal press credentials I'll get into it but anyway I guess he gets tickets or maybe he gets tickets that he gives to somebody but anyway he has got his yet either. So what are you going to the game or not on Saturday all depends on whether or not I get my tickets sometime like the next three days not that they're cutting it closely to understand somebody facts is me this and I'm glad that they did because I did see in the paper this morning almost forgot about it want to be fair want to make sure we attack all sides.

It's Deep South Park with all the dirty language and ethnic slurs to ensure instance success. I'll tell him we have a summer, so, somebody gets in the f*** with my f***ing shit. That's because the f***ing shit is a f***ing shit. And he'll write f***ing shit. It's Deep South Park. Just like South Park, except without rations, Southern accent. Oh, my god, thank you, baby.

Keep plugging away, yes, 21. I don't do a sh***ing more. 18. Say, I don't give a sh***ing. And two say, no, why waste a time? This is five, sixy, QAF. Fort radio, five, sixy, WGQAF, Miami Fort Lunderedale. A measly broadcast group for a man. WQAF.com, or the world. So, I'm going to ask you to go to the guy called, who just came back from Vegas, and they're going to be a son, then, it's about the restaurant that I recommended. The world's wood grill, not being that good, and had a bad piece of meat. And a steak wasn't that good either. So anyway, I was thinking about that call, which was a very bad call, but I came across my travel and leisure magazine that came in the middle yesterday, which I wasn't nearly sh***ing me, immediately. But there's a big thing in here about the American steak out. It's official beef is back, because we don't have mad cow disease here yet. And it's got to think about, it says thanks to a cash rich and protein craving population, the steak houses again, the hottest joint in town from coast to coast. And it says, what's more, some of the countries most celebrated chefs are moving in with a whole new take on the classics. And it's got a list of what they considered to be, the best new steak houses in the country. And here's a big picture of, now didn't you stay at the baraggio? Yes, but I bet you didn't eat at the prime. No. A little bit too rich for your taste, maybe? Yes. It says, don up in chocolate brown and cobalt blue with glit accents and crystal shandleers. Prime is by far the grandest of the new Las Vegas steak houses. They should issue engagement rings at the coach check. And it looks like a really, really good see fancy, fancy, fancy, fancy place. So they list in here in the back of the circle, some of the restaurants they recommend very highly, and in Vegas there are three of them. I just mentioned this in passing. Don't be calling me in a month and say, oh, gee, the restaurant you recommended, we tried it and it sucked. I don't recommend it travel at least your magazine from American Express. They recommend it. Don't blame me. Crime steak house in the belong, your 36-hundred-long Vegas Boulevard South, dinner for 250 bucks. Now what are you laughing about? That's not bad for a steak house. For a real fancy, fancy steak house. And I'm assuming that might include a little wine, something like that, maybe a little egg nog? Do you know how many poles on a slot machine that is? A Charlie Palmer steak in the four seasons hotel, 39-60-long Vegas Boulevard, that dinner for 280 bucks. That's more up your alley. The same cookbook author and Oreo chef goes back to back with unpretentious steak house that flavors quality meats and subtle flavors over a flash. And you know who stays at the four seasons? Bruce Beesley. Who was in here, remember you were here when you was here a few days ago? And we're talking about the fact that this company just brought some stations out in Vegas that they'll be screwing up very soon. Well he likes to stay at the four seasons. And of course, with the money that he's got all of that Beesley stock, he used to be able to afford to stay there. And the other one they list is Del Manico in the Venetian, resorting to, you know, dinner for 230 bucks. But beware, you want an awye? Guess who runs this joint? Emer LaGase kicks it up another notch at the Venetian with Cagin Tink Tind side dishes, gorgeous rib eyes and a melt in the mouth shut the brain on. It says, Emeral kick it up a notch and stick it up your ass. So I'd like I said I like the prime steak house in the Belage, or sounds good to me. And Joe's buying. I want a bag when the butt pony. Coming this summer to a theater near you, it started out as an innocent weekend, wrapped in trip with the guys. Until. Oh. Deliverance 98. He today's hot, you'll keep these dishes, they make the jump to the big screen. Deliverance 98. Sorry Kyle, Kenny and Cartman. Lonnie Ben Oberler. Scooby-O-A-Locken Tind. And, he'll eat the bag.

He loves the staff cowboys on every line. He's got a spotless reputation. America's team is rubbing out. But he's drooling. I've heard some people say. They know how to hear goes down. A. Man. I think so. I just came up with a great program in suggestion. Then you may have just to put your thumb on there right there. Because we're marveling at what an enjoyable show this is. A lot of stuff we haven't heard in a long time. And even the stuff we have is pretty amusing puts a smile on my post. And you said maybe there will be the new best stuff. Or man.

I need it. I feel like a baby's hanging out my ass. I'm hobbling and having trouble lifting my teeth. I'm panic with the fake at lines down the street. It's the abortion shuffle. I'm going to have to get the abortion shuffle. I'm going to have to get the abortion shuffle. Leave me out on the double. Try to get the sex of the fetus out of my baby. I think from the juices that I've had in the work, the max-dating meal fall over my shirt. I'm walking like a hippie and fatigued. At our summer-pupacate, Brad is dressed to the abortion shuffle. The abortion shuffle. I'm going to get the hangar on the double. I'm going to have to get the sex of the fetus out of my baby. I'm going to have to get the sex of the fetus out of my baby. This is Jocelyn Elders and I'm mad. Mad at those right wing sons of bitches that forced Bill Clinton to fire me. Just hold her to hell they think they are. All I was trying to do was deal with the reality of sex and teenagers. Maybe as Jocelyn Holmes had busted a chip or a new gangridge had butted the collar a little more. It wouldn't be so uptight. Slogging a dog never hurt anybody. And if people did a little more that we might save some lives, Helen Clinton just stayed home and spanked the monkey. He'd even be in the last hot water. Teaching kids about masturbation would be no big deal. We could even take some standard teaching tools and just twist them around a little bit like see dick run. When you see dick run, get to the doctor because you picked up a back as a crowd's cricket. Folks, we got to get real about the realities of the world we live in. There are too many kids out there taking a baloney ride and parking their yacht in Hair Harbor. Now if we just teach them to stay home and paddle the pickles, pump the python, walk the door, wax the carrot or tickle the taco. We'd all be better on. That's all I have to say. Now I'm going home now and see if Mr. Elders wants to pop it in the toast and hail an oyster and buzz the griller. Hey, he's one of one faster. Jump higher and make the blind see again. Why do you want to move like a wind? So like an eagle and raise people from that dead car? Yeah. Because there's only one human also. He's gonna lose air. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Come on. What do you think of your name? It's a miracle. Come on. Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? What? What's it? What's it? What's it? What's it? Why? And just put it in the python, man. Oh, what's it? Oh, what's it? Hey, what's it? What's it? Come on. Get it off. Yeah. Jesus. Jesus. Jesus. Why is it Mr. Elders? The pet is pushing Jacob. He's filled with avion. Carefully laid in the vicinity. So every part of your foot is always walking on welfare. So are you not responsible for anyone, James? It turns to why. Come on. Come on. Look for the only air Jesus cross-trees. It's really good to feel like you're pulling again. I just want to say that odd support family values. I love families, especially families with two to three daughters, preferably in the middle 18. Suppled breast, shoulder length long hair. I'm in the twin that really turns me on. And I'll feel your pain. Four more years to my parents. What do you want to do? Some fact have a bigger subpoena than that. Oh, he's just threw around the talk. He's not family values. I don't know what all's about to do. I play the role. His wife is just strong. They're less balanced. The space is the song. He's leading the song. He's just a little bit scared. They're overrated, the keys are with so much time left. She's got no masturbates. You know it.

So, here's a great fact that just comes over to show you that no matter what you do, no matter how you feel at day, everybody should be having a good time, got a little smile on their posts. There's always some sour asshole out there in radio land. Like can you hear this? Somebody some jackass at Advenier Real Estate Management in Dave County. I just mentioned that in passing because it's on the top of the facts. ADVNIR, Advenier Real Estate. Two, whoever gives a crap at fact number so and so. You would think someone making $2 million a year, and working only seven months out of that year, might be able to get on the radio when he's supposedly working and say something. Okay, something like maybe do a show. Instead of playing those piece of schmitsound by it's got it's awful, but it's better than George. I'm signed. How do you like that? How do you like that? Some real sour push. I thought we were having a good show here today. I mean, that is good as yet today, and those great calls we had yesterday. Those retards and mull-ons out there, like probably the guy that wrote his facts. So, let's get rid of this pool we got on here. It's not growing anywhere anyhow. They don't care about the charity thing at all. Should the above of a charity campaign is any more $190,000. 100% yes, 67% I don't give a shmit 13% no. It's not growing anywhere. So, here's a better poll for today. About today's show. How should we word it? How do you like today's show? Because this is going to be out there little more more. Yeah, how would you rate today's show? Great. I love it. B. It's okay. C. Better than George. Just to piss him off because he's home drinking egg nog. Or D. It sucks. How's that? Over the choices again? Great. I love it. B. It's okay. C. Better than George. Or D. It sucks. There you go, Eric. New poll up. Yeah, these people have to have something to bitch and belly it. What about? Would you have thought that anybody aside from the fact they didn't get the free hockey to get you a side from that? What have anything to bitch about today? Oh, I wouldn't have thought so. God, I've played some stuff today that even I'm getting the chuck a lot because I haven't played it in the crew's age. But some jackass or would add the New real estate management in date County has got a bug up his ass. Yeah, maybe got a bad case of crams or something. What came after better than George? Better than D. It. No, or sucks is the last one. There's four choices. It's great. I love it. It's okay. C. Better than George or D. If sucks, I hate it. Or however, Eric wants to put it sucks. It blows. Stick it up your ass. Whatever negative because they have to have a negative. Because this town is never happy. Yeah, there they go. Another happy. And by the way, for my friend at Avenue, something. See that I said it again for my four million year. Between that guy, Josie Lambe, by the end of 2001, you can 60 million here, not bad. Not bad. You may be ex. You're hallucinogenic idiots. Anybody want some good egg nons? Oh, let's do the break. 24 pass, no, it's five, six, they're QOM. This is five, sixy, QOM. Listen, New Roger, so. This is your brain. Any questions? Well, this need that you're as present. A touching story of a little boy named James. Oh. Oh. Hmm. Oh. It's huge. Cisco and Ebert say it's a stiff. James Charlotte says somebody got this hair. James and the giant penis. I'm a star. It's James. Now showing it theaters everywhere. Oh. Oh. It's a girl's and my necker's a giant. Do you let the hour to give you a go? When he makes it way go, money goes, not the kind. You can do in the behind, but a cigar and her vagina. She's all mine. Where he don't know where a store he goes. I can see how there was some confusion between humans or an human horse. And then I can saw the term, see their box. Means saw her naked. Stars reportedly to go with lines. That's it. And he was working hard. Late nights in the ovary office. Working on a practical job. It took a massive noodle for the next floating. Loading for a mine. I go with the wall and drink the store. It's a girl's and my necker's a giant. She lets out a girl. Every time he makes it way go. My necker is not the kind. You can do in the behind, but a cigar and her vagina. She's all mine. Oh, people feel that he's been. Made a fool of by a husband. Feel that Hillary was wronged. A family in that room. She was mowing. Mowing now. Boring with two and her. With two bowls of bombs. Bill's a girl's and mine. A girl's vagina. She lets out a girl. Every pregnant time he makes it way go. My necker is not the kind. You can do in the behind, but a cigar and her vagina. She's all mine. Oh, can't you see me? Yes, I'm sorry. It's that girl. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm going to tell you. They are just, uh, I don't even know where we're for it. Only seven, seven votes under. So for really only six, because I had to vote to get to think going, I voted great. I love it. Joe would vote great. He loves it too, but he don't have a computer in there. Yeah. That's only one of his great. I love it. One says it sucks. Two, what's okay and three it's better than George? That's the initial sampling of our first half dozen inmates. Out there in radio land. Is that a pathetic or one? I guess maybe we ought to have for those great calls like we had yesterday. That should do it. Huh? On days like that when you walk out to the door and you wish that you never had to come and you're talking to these people again. Days like that, like yesterday. I think I really believe that we have a whole bunch of people listening to show who enjoy like what we had yesterday. Not just the idea to work calling, but the idea to listen to that. You agree? You think that's true? Without a doubt. Oh, Jesus, God. You'll have to be kidding me. Boy, they got the old man all riled up today. Oh, yeah. Who's the whip of an ass? Man, talk about lifeless. Billy, time for your animal. I'd squeeze mom, not another animal. Kids just hate getting animals. And mom's hate giving them. But now there's a friend who animate a kid just love. Introducing you, Eminemos. They can't be good at chocolate animat that makes getting cleaned out fun. Hey, mom, can I have another animal? I don't know, Billy, that makes your third animal today. Please, well, okay. Cool off. And this time, I want a green one. Oh, sorry, son. I took off the green one. I bad, my two boys. You and an animus. Melt in your butt. Not in your head. What's needed here badly? I know that was one. Like a ghost in the ocean. Strongly will not. And a pound on the show. Because I'm weak. Yeah, I know. Please, say it. I know that was one. Like a ghost in the ocean. Strongly will not. And a pound on the show. Because I'm weak. Yeah, I know. Please, say it. Hey, no. You're too keenly of me. Wow, baby. Fun is a cute. What's it called? It's just fun, it's a cute. You can show who we are. Who's that of you? If you blow me. Just one thing to do. Oh, baby. One thing to do. What's it called? Just one thing to do. You need it. I know. You can show me. Oh, baby. Just one thing to do. Okay, so what do you say, you're a six-year-old. Don't don't answer them. WQAM. Oh, yes. The old parody of that patch spot. It's the plan. Yeah. Can you play it? The pack spot. Yeah. The ATPH. Yeah. What did I just say? Yeah. Can you play it? You have it in there. Okay. You have it in there. Go ahead. One moment please. Okay. He's working on it. He's patching it up. Yeah. Yeah. What is it that you're doing? Or are you trying to find the cut? Finding the cut. Mm-hmm. Because there was no disconnect. And by the way, don't worry. I have to trade out pal. So it'll get all whipped up to a frenzy about it. Hey, Southwater. Time for. I didn't feel you the dollar-tudy economy. Get... No, I'm bad. And you can get... Oh, you got it. There we go. Oh, you got to do it. They close attention to this poorly written copy. That's part of the fun. See, you're out of a whip differently trying to say and get... That's right. Come and ride here in Southwater. What a futsin, or whatever. And it is now. I'm sure that the do-wist fed-ag. With good things, you'll get... Oh, that's nice. And he's brilliant of dollar-tudy economy. And you know what that means? Well, our empty stadium. Once you know that you're, it must be about some kind of weird fut thing. For so many of the dumbest that Junk and Sporthouse can understand what we're talking about. That's... it's the... That's... On right, do something now. And go wherever it is because it's the... That's... Okay, it is. There you go. Nobody's a QOM. Hey, there are only things I missed the other day with the police got my Pock to the tuna police, not the dot. Yeah. I played it for the time of this week. All the 80? Yeah. Damn, I missed it. Okay, sorry. Sorry, but at least, you know, he, at least he said, dammit or something like that. He was no better shape and got a bow as brains out of a stockbroker's either. I might even play it again just because I'm in such a good mood here and for me. It took great, two-grade Americans in a row. How do you like that? I think. Sure, I press my lock. WQOM. Yeah, can we have a two-hank go broke sounds? What is it? The two are the hanko broke. Clonic, chronic ash or right there. WQOM. How old, chronic Patrick? Yes. It's fatherly. Yeah. Five. Good one. Is it kind of a Patrick's still alive? No, I don't think so. I don't think he's, I think he sleeps with a friscious conrad Patrick. What about Dick's fatherly? He's an old young prolocutor. Yeah, we know that. WQOM. Joe. What is it? Oh, Joe, right? Yeah, Joe. Yeah, I mean, Neil says he's in a good mood, but they're going to back to hell out of me. Yeah, probably. He don't like them bloody rich. Yeah, that's just a bunch of queens. Sweet queens. Do you think I can't stop the law? Do you think I get away with a request? You know, way with it? Yeah. Oh, I don't know, maybe. Oh, do you think he can be help? Well, I don't care. Why do you like it? What did you want on action? Pardon? Yeah. I can get it. Oh, I lost it. Okay. I'm not seen skinned. Okay, here's a British call on six, hello. Hello. Hello. I'm actually a hell out of me. I got crooked teeth. I'm always drunk. Yeah. And loud and up noxious. Yeah. Oh, that's right. Then you must be British, right? Yes. I don't think they probably gay. Well, that's synonymous. Is it the British? Well, a little swishy anyway. Well, maybe I still like you. Do you have a thing for Prince William? No, I do not. Good. He's ugly and has buck teeth in big ears. But anyway. Anyway, I was wondering if I had the British beard power. The British spears. Yeah, it's been a while. Which one is that? It's the one with a buck hanging out of pants. Okay. Thanks, Neil. To the loo. You're my best friend. To teens. Bye. Tata. I don't think so. And you know something. What is the name of that other one? I'm not sure which one he's talking about. I'll play all three of them. Because we find that. I finally did make George put that in here after about two years. See, we had a lot more stuff in the DCS. Except for the fact that the intern that we used to have, what was your name? Shannon. Shannon. Except for the fact that she was here to be doing stuff like that. But what I wasn't here when I'd leave a tour clock every day. And Shannon and George would be generally a he had to do an errands that involved being down there on a floor on her knees by the cabinet over there. And had very little to do with putting anything in the computer here. Yeah. I see your life. But it's a nervous life because you know what I'm saying is true. Absolutely. I know nothing. Just like what I said before about how there's never been anybody in a skirt or a dress that George wouldn't go up and hug, wildly and hysterically and enthusiastically. Even if it wasn't necessarily a woman. If that is skirt or a dress on it, he's going to squeeze it in the hunger for all he could get out of it. I think the word we're looking for there is desperate. So what that per one here? This is 560. You AF. This isn't your mother's ring or name. This is a **** rock. For 3.0560. You A.F. How young is too young? You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're a little bit too young. You're like a snack, do you think anyone's in the hospital? I am a little bit too young. Why do you know? One million. This isn't your boy's ring. You're a little bit too young. You're a kind with knowledge you're just an officer. You just ten thousand years old. You're quite curious about your picture. You've lived with love for a hundred years. As long as you're playing. Your words, prefectures, what about you? To be www.guirוכorn.com No, you too no longer can work without the Chinese extract I don't know who gained that story. You're talking about that. He's the absolute worst. He's a noxious. He's an asshole. He's uh man. What was he doing in the middle of his show? Frank from the sales department that knows he doesn't belong anywhere while his show is going on? What was he doing? We're going to steal some more cigarettes since he knows they brought us on the other day personal that our friend George had to come up here from Nick's one of our listeners and bring us to Garus. What was he bugging him about? He had some news for me about the way. He has a lot of cuts about. About one. The sponsor of my show. What the hell doesn't have to do with this show? I have no idea. Well Tom would talk to you after two o'clock. If he had to talk to you at all, I told him. He's a cram. Man, talk about nervous. He this is a guy who has thrown all of our stuff. Not just this to Garus, but there was like a special cutter. They sent up for George every single thing they ever gave and that he ate appropriated for himself. And they he'd have like pointed on it. One of our finest sponsors, one of the some of the nicest people he'd ever want to know. And this sort of a bitch and he's got the girl coming there. Fuck that fat in the middle of his show because he's a lion. And he fits in ourselves department like a glove. Anyway, here's a fact from Jack. You all believe this. I can't believe it. What was the name of the song you played just a few minutes ago, another day, another night in who sings in a very catchy tune. Somebody actually liked that song by A1 who are four young guys from England. It's called same. What is it? Same old brand new you. And you don't have to worry about going on buying it because you can't get it anyway. It's a European thing. That British. It's number one in England. Four young guys, two of whom look pretty an end good if you ask me, but you know, who cares? Certainly better than the people talk about best of shows. This is real world. You ask me what I've been watching here all day for lack of anything better. Real world on MTV. It's been on there. I've been watching for almost three hours. There isn't then one person on there of either gender that you are. I would touch with the somebody else's hand. And this is the best of real world. They just don't get it. Where is 7th heaven again? Where the hell is my show? 7th heaven. Okay, we're taking some of these calls here because they don't send me the one to hear this crap. WQAM. I could just tell you all of the good stuff. Got the one boy story. A good one. I'm friends with Scott the one boy. Yeah, I got a good story pump. Yeah, go ahead. You're on. Hey, I'm my friends with Scott. Yeah, before you went away, I told you about if you was getting married in June, I think. Yeah, did he ever come back because my yard is a mess. Come on, Scott get whether you lazy bastard. Yeah, he doesn't walk anymore. Oh, really? Yeah, he's a, uh, a thought thing reporter. What does that mean? Well, drives around the truck. What does that mean? Yeah. I went to the wedding in June. You got married in the capital church down here in Bokeh. I got good and those up for the wedding. So I'm sitting there with my wife and the priest comes out and the priest has over the uh, the priest has the lift. My bed he likes Scott. Yeah. My bed he was one of his favorites. It was a lot of his favorites and one of my favorite songs, uh, the one gentleman who stood up and sang, I gave Maria and I always wrote a few and two and three all. It was just a little too much. You never thought every time you call you, I'll be Maria, I just think of you and another priest I was thinking maybe the priest would was singing himself to him. Like maybe you want to let me wear your ringer about my thing around your ring or however that goes. Yeah, yeah, everything like that. But I was not that thought had to ring around the thing. He had to ring around the thingy. Yeah. I'm not getting anything. But Scott, but Scott was looking very good at that. I just want to let you know. Okay, thanks. Thanks for the night. You made my day. That's my a long guy Scott, my lawn and he's never laid the long guys. He's got to put to those pans. He's once you if I give or get a hold of them. And he's right. Here's him on a work. This is a guy. You can't get a hold of him for a long or money or anything. That's a good job if you can ever get a hold of it. WQAM. Hey, God, how's it? Okay. Hey, listen, how about a gym manager to keep saying? I pay a 50 bucks for one. Okay, it's a good idea. Because you can't rip that off right. All right. Oh, yeah. How about a whole bunch of matters for me? Okay. Thanks. Have a great day. God. See, what are such a good move on a phone today? If I notice, I might have taken a few calls, but I sure doubt it. Don't you think? Only in the banana republic, baby. Only in Miami. I want to bang on the butt. Yeah, somebody should be good on the key chain like I want to bang on the butt. Can you make a walk it up behind somebody and play in that or oh my God, we're breathed for a beautiful. Hey, yeah. And tie up. Oh, where the hell is it? So I just got off. Stuck and can't get off. Where the hell is that managed? Don't be in here by the way, too. Come on briefly. Reefly 12345. We got an event coming up this afternoon. Anybody who didn't like this show today, you're a risk that this show was back on here. Once you hear the Miami Hurricanes and the Lee High Mountain Hawks Back to Boygame. Wow. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You're so big. Yeah. Those are big red on the key chain. I think we just got a great deal. If I maybe we could have like a, how about you live in kind of key chains? Hank Oberkichane. Yeah. Hey, stupid. Why? Or maybe how about a Joe Rose key chain? Wouldn't be too bad. If I could find any of this stuff on here. I'd rub the butcher out now. Yeah. Or go fuck you behind go back behind it again or under it or he is one good looking guy. Yeah. Grab the wood. I like the weepy. Yeah, that would be big on Joe's key chain. You can kiss my whoo ran. I think this guy just made us about 100 grand for next year's fundraiser. Thank you, sir. Some red. I took the old pull off of there because, um, yeah, not gonna work on Scott's pull. I mean, this guy's pull. Look at those phones smoking. They see today. I just, I would like with a stock market. I zig when I should zag it. I market still a good idea. Turn it out for just a second. I don't want to stay there too long because it's bad luck. Let me know if I should fire up the call screening machine. No. Why would you want to do this? I don't want to. Because then you get all the comics on there. Like that, Mr. Do also called Hank at 20 after two years that he was already faxed me this morning. But one of the old mention on the year anymore. They on mention of a misfit. Really poorly turned burger from the hockey games. WQA. You're missing on the year anymore. Hey, how's it going, Joe? All right. What did I see if you could pull your version of butterfly kisses? I would just make my whole life. Would that do it for you? That thing's so new. You got it. Thank you. Have a happy. I think it's daddy's daddy. You sucky? I'm sure. I'm pretty yet. There's two things on the wall. She'll be dead. I think mommy's on the wall. She was dead here for heaven. And she's daddy's little girl. I want back home in my tent. I got for all of the time. I think mommy's on the wall. butterfly kisses. It's time, Chris. It's too little white flowers all in the internet. Nice and damn little these years. Oh, at home that I have to roll. Come on, so don't come in. I'm glad you're going to die. To deserve all of the good people. But if I could see that night. Daddy's not here. I'm dropping out of place. I'm dropping out of place. Daddy, I'm pregnant. One part, one. The other part. I don't know who the father is. I'm in the middle. From ribbon band, chair. That's the turn, kick. I drove the climb to a tree. Can you just send me some cigarettes? Can you just send me some cigarettes? butterfly kisses. I can't help on a toast for the brightening world. You changed your name today. Dad, I'm getting married again. You make a promise. And I'll give her away. Dad, that's my ass. Standing in the bright room. Just staring. I think I have to pull it. Ask me what I'm thinking. And I said, I'm not sure. No, I've got to let it go. But I'll always give a hug. Hey, pop. We're moving in. Look at the more. And butterfly kisses. Dad, ask me, I'm a lesbian. It started out a regular guy who joined the electric race. And made me ultimate sacrifice in embracing celebrity puzzle tools. Hey, man. I'm a woman who's a... I'm a woman who's a... I'm a lesbian. I've time with my his earthly knee. Come, bring my his joy. It bound away to get really by altering young boys. Father who too. Hey, man. I'm a woman who's a... I'm a woman who's a man who's a lesbian. He was happy and gay, till he got close. And there was some saddle tell. Then the Vatican said, every one of them. He didn't have to go this year. Father who too. Hey, man. I'm a woman who... I'm a woman. I'm a woman who's a lesbian. They sent him to a three-three-squared, a genuine, black-dent-ray. It was you, or it was me. They'd lock this up and throw the keys away. Father, go through. And then... Only two... Come on, come on. Father, go through. All today, go through. Father, go through. Amen! Father, go through. Father, go through. Yeah, not some pretty good idea for the other people in the station to participate in our fundraiser. They don't even have to do anything. They just let us divorcees on the keychain, right? Let's see. We can have one for Hank, where he would say, Are you... Hey, stupid! Where if I can find the damn thing? Come on, Hank. You can do it, sweetheart. Where do I look? Where is he? That was... This is my third tri-foces. Yeah. Or he could say... I just don't have the time. That's incredible to me. There's so much spurious stuff under where he's not saying anything in the DCN. As opposed to the Mad Dog or the Joe Rose ones, where he just grabbed the wood. One after the other, like... I like the weebe. Oh, why? Or that. Anyway, here's one that says, I love the format you have this in that which I already played Father O'Toole. And I will play Virgin Mary and God bless you, sir. See, there's some happy people out there. It's just that one jackass who kind of threw me off there. That piece of turd. What about this one? What the f*** is that? Yeah. Nice job on that to the first time, by the way. George said it was okay. Yeah, George Wood said it's okay. He still doesn't even get the egg nog. Anyway, 62 votes, how would you like today's show? 21 great, I love it. 19, it's better than George, which must be saying a lot because they liked George, especially that the Middle East show. It's okay, 13, and 9 say it sucks. How do you like that? The I'm... Lifeless Festions, but there's still listening. This is 560 QAL. 430, 560. WDQAF has a report-logger-dale of measly broadcast group station. WDQAM.com, or the word... Oh, bro, it's the one to two hours. Oh, we're in Paris. Oh, we're in Paris. Now the pork depends on you. And the power you've got is... ...in your name, his life. He's like, his life. He's got a job on your tissue. He's got a job on your tissue. And the bread... You're in Paris. You have a brand new style too. We love the way you fuck or do. WDQAM, with the big deal on your chest. And the group is like this. What's that mean going to feel our own friends? F***ing Paris! Oh, yeah, I got a job. We're in Paris. We're in Paris. WDQAM, with the speed of what's this sound. And the fact that you're a few hells. WDQAM, with the filming for QAL, my H Kosten Hero... WDQAM?! 50. It's always on my Healing Bee. Got it. 10. 50? 50. and it seemed the only reason I put this thing about it's better than Georgia and there was because it was in that facts, you know, a little sarcasticly. But I noticed that a lot of people go out of their way to give him a shot. Have you noticed that? And he's always saying that they hate me like poison. I'm beginning to believe that they may have a point. Now what is it that you think that they hate about them? It's because he's a spick. Is that a little Cuban or... They're jealous of him. Paul, I think not. And pre-meals is that another thing. There's jealous of what? Of his closest association with our Goldstein? That. Yeah, other things. Now, I'm really curious about that. What is it? Is it the topics that they know like, like, the course you're responsible probably for most of them? Like eating ass? Absolutely not. And what was the other one that he did about five weeks on about anal sex, which we already driven in the ground, if you've part in that expression, the only one I was responsible for was underage girls giving blow jobs. Yeah. Which was you responsible for that? Well, probably a lot of guys are happy to hear that. You're welcome back. Yeah. Under... Under all, well, I had to do the thing I was talking about the other day. The fact that they did that survey in the kids today, and we can thank Baba for this. Most of these kids today, or at least a very large percentage of them, no consider all sorts, to be having sex. That was our topic. And so there's this epidemic of young girls who are like giving blow jobs in a day, and they don't consider that to be having sex. Which I guess would be fine, except for the fact that there's a lot of disease being spread. And if you're a doctor, lots of disease, although we do have that basket full of economists. I always go to have an extra kind of in your basket, just in case of the emergency and lotions. Right. Loosen's in potions. In fact, I kind of wonder who the whole brought that always the people from plant parenthood who brought that in. You weren't here that day. And I said, what's that you got with you, that creature? It works the lotion in the basket. Is what you said, yeah, he did it. There's the basket sitting right there, which I don't know, she's emptying out very rapidly. So maybe Miguel or somebody around here, it sure is Robert Creeper. I'll tell you that, let's he's blowing up bubbles, balloons. It sure isn't that twerper that quizzling. Anyway, so we'll find out what it is about George, those disgusting topics or the fact that, I mean, why else could it be? Are you suggesting another poll question? No, no, no, no, no. I mean, just since we're taking a few calls, yeah, let's change the poll every 15 minutes. I don't like this one anyway. I'm stupid. There, jealous. You want to take an, okay, let's take the poll. We're going to change the air, I'm going to have it to respect that. Hey, listen, you got nothing else going on anyway, they're in holidays. They'll keep you from eating fat, so you could save it for tomorrow. No, I'll come up with a whole bunch of different ones. I do good, Paul, you got to admit that. Yes, I do sensational poll. In fact, Scott's a long man, if you want to show up again, I'll be happy to show you. First hand, he probably don't look that good anymore anyway. I think you think that if you're in that business in your landscaping business, you have regular customers, which he's been doing my house right around how many years, now at least six, seven years, at least. When you think that like every year, you send a card or make it like the dentist does, like anybody does. And then make it appointment for like it's that time of the year again, I can't come and put the panties in. Oh, whatever they're going to do, you know, just go ahead and I don't need to be there. He leaves a bill on the mailbox. I sent out a check as soon as I get home that day. He gets to the next day. It's a painter's transaction. Scott, trust me. But he just, every year, it's the same thing. I think he likes being chased. That's what an ED. He loves it. Good Catholic board that he is. He likes having the guys chase him around. So what the hell was I saying? The new poll is, now I know you're responsible for this. You're always saying, oh, George, I put you up to all this stuff. You're responsible for this. Here he's on vacation. He's in town. Anybody else that needs any egg nags? He's in town. So don't worry about that. I was defending him. So yes, I am responsible for this. If any him for what? Defend you said, why do they? Why did they? No, you're the one that said he comes up with all the gross topics like ED and you said that. Well, I said, who came up with that topic? ED and asked? Yeah, he did. Oh, sounds to me like you just said that. Look, he's still going to give you the egg nags for nothing. So what are you worrying about? I mean, of course. Friend that you are George. Oh. What a shame. Why don't you probably know where to get better stuff? Anyway, here's the new poll. The new poll is who's got the best egg nags in town? Now, here's the new poll. Why do you think? Now, this is we're not asking you per se. But why do you think so many people dislike George? Is that a good way to put it? Sure. First, you're always because they're jealous. That's your suggestion. Maybe because he's Cuban, say because they hate his topics or because they think he sucks. Huh? How is that? Does that cover the whole gamut? Well, sucks is, meaning sucks is a top show host or in general. As a top show host. Okay. So we've making more specific because they think he sucks on the air. Huh? Yeah. I didn't think we needed to spell it out. Isn't that the same as hate topics? You could have great topics, but you suck on the air. Why? Hate topics and sucks on the air is almost the same thing. No, it is not. If he could have great topics, they might like his topics. They just don't think he belongs on the air. Don't you get the message? I do get the message. Okay. Now, what the hell are the choices again? Before Eric, it's all confused and he's screwed up this poll. jealousy. jealousy? Jell is saying Cuban because he's Cuban. Hate the top. Because they hate his topics or they think he sucks on the air. That's for a good topics. If you want to be honest, choose to take good shots of your good friend George while he's a well-invocation. And you know he is listening. Even though he'll deny it.moح It''''変,ate on Gonzalez! Why the hell don't you pull up? Break up all of that, who I miss?

The poor should have been if he wouldn't wanted it the way you wanted. Why do you think so many people hate George like poison? That would have been the way you would have ordered it. I didn't say that. Why did he came close just like him so much? Well, here we only have 13 votes or a file, but we're just getting going. Because they hate his topics five because he sucks any year for, because they're jealous of him three because he's Cuban, so lament they own all. That was your vote? No, I'm not telling you what I voted. We got those to which one it was. I would say because he's Cuban. No, the the audience hate Miguel? Oh, they love Miguel. Well, he's Cuban. This is five sixty.

Because they hate his topics 11 and because he's Cuban safe six I'm going to surprise that that. He was the logic in that if they all love Miguel and he's Cuban wise that somebody of them dislike George and he's Cuban. Maybe he just don't look like Miguel maybe that's part of the problem. WQAN.

The best to see there's somebody like George here and I like poison. It's better what you said. But that's a good idea. Why couldn't we do that? All that's right, because it creates a problem because then we have to have the front money to make up more new key chains. And then we get back to that same argument because George is the hardest about it. Hey pal, hit a hand with that! No! No! Ouch! Next time you go shopping, go to Scrotems.

Well, what the hell do they do that for? So now I have turned on the radio and you'll think that we're going out of our way. I'm going out of my way to remove my idea. It was not. Especially the wording of it. Especially when you got all the fenture about how it was definitely his idea about doing six weeks on eating ass. How's that pork coming so far since you are just flipped on a radio? Why do you think so many people dislike George so much? Well, he won't mind that because he's the one that's always saying that they hate me like poison. He's always saying, I said, no they don't. Yeah, they hate me. He's insisting on that. And I say, okay, well, I'm not going to argue with any more that hate you like poison.
