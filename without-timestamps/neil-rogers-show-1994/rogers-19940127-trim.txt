you know what I'm saying if we said we have 195 or we have 196 and we're getting really close we're like right on the edge then it's kind of like an incentive to get people to get out to peaches and

Steven Tampa facts is me somebody called yesterday wanted to know what what the infractions can result in a penalty shot in a hockey game and there were a couple of them that I remembered well three actually and there are five believe it or not number one following a player from behind during a breakaway in other words a player near the team's got a breakaway he's going to go in alone and you're like drag them down from behind number two falling on or picking up the puck in the crease area number three okay except of course for the goalie number three throwing a stick number four deliberately displacing the goal during a breakaway number five deliberate illegal entry to the game like you know they're in the middle of you know something going on and somebody just jumps off gets emotional and jumps out there like Scotty Bowman so thank you Steve from Tampa also by the way something I've noticed I didn't know where George just went all the way to I thought I guess was a false alarm I thought he may have run downstairs because those facts is oh because they're ponytail one thing about his food it's always delicious from the pizza law but one thing like if you're a little bit plugged up and I'll make you sh** every time I mean it works like a charm he ought to seriously he could make a fortune on the side with this he could bust him in from surf side and haladale and tamarack and all of a sudden I mean incredible miracles did you rat the trough man and I'll make you sh** every time and it goes down good too and comes out easy anyway we have an open line in Broward five two four and one on the sterlin in my right I mean we got a lot of witnesses in here you ought to see the line down stairs well it's lubricated here's a cut that cheese will ya here's a mobile in Miami hello joody holds you it's put you believe it or Murphy Roger Nielsen too yeah far faster Jewish because you can see that oh John B.B. Brooks to you oh for Murphy's Jewish could you believe it? like far faster Patrick again and John B.B. Brooks too has a matter of fact all the penders are Jewish and I fell in love with you just you belong to good I fell in love with you beauty we have an open line in date 751 everybody wants to make promo which rhymes with Momo and one on the sterlin at sterild what were getting that belt that the cellular one line starting on Tuesday that's a done deal it is not gonna work in Tampa by the way but they can dial star s.u. went in Tampa on their GTE which I keep forgetting to mention because we never have any open lines over there anyway almost real we got off to a slow start today I have a feeling that they were a little down to the dumps today and I do want to say because I try to be fair I'm not gonna come out say oh boy look at this you go you know you did your best job and you couldn't win a game although I think I did say that but not quite as vindictively but I mean they played a hell of a game man they bottled us up they out shot us they out played us they kicked us into the ground and we still got the tie thanks to the beezer and our great penalty killing skills which we will we were going to the game last day we're all the way up to number eight in the league in penalty killing which is great and we ought to be out of it because we sure had enough experience especially early early in the season almost every game we had like two or three times we were too many short and usually killed those off so anyway but you know try to be objective and they are lightning have really come along we are proving dramatically poop is just outstanding and he also even though he didn't stop as many shots he made some phenomenal saves last night but they're a little disappointed because they you know they had twenty thousand people under again they were all in thuis they were all worked up this is like their last chance to kick our ass and get a you know a win and they threw everything they had but the chicken sick in the octopine he ice and they couldn't do it so I understand here's a mobile on alligator rally hello yeah yeah first time caller all right let's see all the time coming across the alley yeah I'm always going back and forth from Marco while in the farm there was a show a lot why try for that panther crossing over there yeah well you know what I got to say you've done a great job with the hockey down here it's really a Niagara by basketball but I'm really trying to become a fan and last night I was going back forth from Miami to the hockey game and I thought I'd come to the basketball game last two minutes there's twenty five minutes yeah that's why when you're watching NBA game especially during the regular season it's not even worth watching the first you know the last two three minutes is all you need to watch because either it's a blowout by then which means it was a boring game or if it's going to be exciting it all happens in the last two or three minutes which takes about a half an hour to play yeah it was amazing I really thought the the he saved I don't know how the problems right now yeah you can say that again all right you guys really support basketball down to that much I don't really hear much about the he deserve a big following down there yeah they've they've been selling out just about every game although this year they're starting to lose a little bit of the natives are getting a little restless but yeah they they've sold out every game for as long as they've been here okay this is what I say you're going to mark a while on up over to hey um this is a joy show and out of the all time and uh good luck and great job see yeah thank you all okay okay I'm going over there and saying hey good guy but uh we're busy we have an open line it's on a blue line five two four nine four six three right on a blue line right between the two blue lines what was that expression that asshole from Sarasota used there oh man did that guy I very rarely do I let a call even linger in my mind around my fingers for more than like a couple of minutes but he was just so typical of the sour pie that is down here sour push push I whatever it is but just so goddamn many of man did all it just so crotchety and crotchety and sour about everything man called Dr. Jack up in Detroit and see if he can't come down to put that guy out of his misery and once he does that that'll help the rest of us too a lot here's Boca speaking of misery hello hello new Rogers yes sir hey I got a lot to cheer you up with okay first of all thank you Mr. Van B's berkwell take the time yes we'll take the point thank you so very much very good and uh hey I got I just had a funny thing happen to me is the acasco and del Rey Beach I was praying for that game to get over by the way I kept saying I'll take the tie I pray just just speed up the clock get it over and we'll take the point thank you yes I've costco and where in del Rey Beach right and the members only like a price club thing and all these the seniors I was checking out my groceries there and the seniors are trying to get in because they've the members inside get a dollar fifty like hot dog and lunch and they're all trying to get in there and they said to the man we want to go inside and have lunch and he says you have to be a member and they go no but we just want to have a hot dog and they wouldn't take no for an answer they're all arguing with them and I said to the guy at the door I said you gotta be just he's gotta be kidding there's there's he says there's at least fifty of them every hour trying to get in to get a dollar fifty hot dog so he says I love to turn them away and they all go away arguing and yelling and none of them want to join the club of court he lentless search for a cheap weeding del Rey then to big time in gravely they listen now my friends are down from Montau jersey and they're loving it down here and we're turning on your show can you play that Harry carry compilation that he sent down to you with him saying

line in brown we have three now is a matter of fact and I'm getting very very disfunded about that you know what I mean here hey Neil for you and one in date and one on the end we're not one two three four looks like to me now it looks like four doesn't it like is a forty percent of the board but once we get the cellular one line then we'll have eleven lines and then we can say we have thirty two open lines and dates seventy five in brown twenty seven on a green lines four a mobile lines and by the time we get done tell how many lines are open a show will be over which sounds like a hell of a good scam to me eleven forty eleven central time and twelve forty eight eastern time at W. I. D. and W. S. U.

Please I don't know if you looked in the paper to the Have you ever read out buckwall? Not if I can help it Well you don't No I like our buckwall But just when I see him on those TV shows And I realize that he can't speak I feel uncomfortable watching him Because he just can't move his mouth They're just some lack of something there You ever seen him in person? I mean like on TV I feel like he just can't speak He's a funny guy to read but he can't speak Well the headline for his article To do is laryna Bob and for Sirgy General Beauty I thought that was kind of interesting She could sniff it There were a couple other things One of them is about the circumcision Yes I personally experienced that And I had it I was born And I didn't have the circumcision Yeah So when I was 40 and I had to have 49 Because the skin had lost its tinsel Resilient It's tinsel? So you could move it on a Christmas tree Any more right? That's right And so I had to have the circumcision What do you mean the skin had lost I don't want to get to graphic What does that mean? Lost its tinsel Well the head lost its Placipillin The elasticity Oh man That's a better word Oh this was like a brick Well it was painful You know what I was Well I liked that Wow So anyway I had to have the circumcision Well but the first few years I really didn't notice anything different But as time went by like Ten years later It really loses its sensitivity a lot And I think that was Well maybe it might have been the fact that it was ten years later That might have had something to do with it Oh sure Well it's a gradual process But I think that was on there To a natural selection for some reason And if I might some had it too Had the circumcision done Yeah it was automatically done lately But now they're getting less and less You know automatically doing that Because you know The things are not there for an old reason Natural selection Did put in like your appendix Any your tautils Your tautils Any your appendix Right They're obsolete just like for skin Well necessarily The tonsils of are not taken up For skin was fine back in the old days before Guys had clothing on to kind of like protect their privates from the you know the elements But even with the clothing on And when it's rubbing up against They're all the time with no Rubbing up against You know But from my own experience I'm saying yeah And it doesn't follow the dirt you're not hygienic if you have horse You know I've never missed a day with a ticket a shower for God knows how many years Right So it isn't necessarily dirty not to of course not just long as you got a good scrub brush And some nice lava Right And that's a tough one To share with you Yeah I've worked in Well you graduated from Michigan No I did not.
