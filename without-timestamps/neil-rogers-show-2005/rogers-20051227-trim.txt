Sure. Well, you don't have an overhead there like I have in my studio. I don't know. That's an overhead. The overhead speaker that lets you hear yourself into colors. What do you listen to the colors through your headphones? Yeah. Oh, geez. Yeah. It's not good for you. We're very contemporary here. No, you don't want to know. That's not contemporary. It's unhealthy. No. Kind of compresses your head. You know, you've got a fat head. You know, like, flat head. No, a fat head, both. Oh, so having those headphones on a fat head, like kind of compresses, like, like, be like, wearing one of those things where you, to lose weight. You put around your waist and you know, to push on your body. Oh, yeah, those are getting felt. Right. That's the same thing with your head. Maybe your head will lose some weight. Yeah. The incredible shrinking head. Yeah. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha. I, I don't mean actually something that your head will lose weight when you remove your hair piece. And then you see how long did it say? I haven't mentioned one word about my close best personal friend. And there we go again. What made you think I was with how to talk about powdered waves like, Dolly Madison. That's that's sinful. That's disgraceful. Oh, you got to give me credit though. I am bearish to mod of it. I am bearish to these ziggler tosses piece of IOD and then the same with your body, Mo here with that awful must be muskware. He's so weird. That was a good idea. Wow. And then he used to talk about my baggy pants and how to how I looked and how do you leave the house looking that way and more. How do you, how does anybody leave the house with a muskware on their head and more. And so I'd like to know. Forgetting about picking the bingo berries. That's another story. Boy. You got to admit, boy, sure has been a colorful period of time. There's no question about that. Not enjoyable but colorful. Yes. It certainly has been. You have to go a long way to make it to kind of swirl. That's been an, and of course. Yeah. One of the world's biggest BS artists. I kicked our jazz in the arcade. Yeah. I tell you, if a well was a successful as he claims he is, he'd be making 50 million a year. We like right up there with Stern. He said a lot of jobs. The sure has job of the week. I think he's working blessed. I already was in Atlanta. No, no. That's long run. He's been doing fox sports. Whatever. Oh, that's right. He's doing late overnight. Whatever though. They had that Atlanta thing. They changed format. After you got everything. Got the format. He hasn't had what to do in that. No. Not a bad person. Just a little nuts. Yeah. So, but he's not the only one. So, most overrated personalities. Okay. Celebrities. Not personalities. Most overrated celebrities. I mean, we've done this many times like Rosie O'Donnell and Yeah, that's. Rosie and bar people at just disgusting. I have no talent. Bill Mars and other one. I just can't stand him. Yeah. Okay. That's we'll work on that. I'm working on that for. Yeah, I'm just talking about actors and, you know, talk show host. Whatever. Well, what do you mean you're not talking about actor. How can you have celebrities and they're not the actors? Well, there are celebrities who are celebrities because. Whatever reason. Yeah. He's been making a movie. Yeah. I mean, he's like, pulls, please, because you're just not a poll creator. No. How do you do a, how do you order poll like this? Most overrated celebrities who are actors. But 80, six week is they're making a movie about you know who she is? I have no idea. She was, she was a person who hung out with Andy Warhol. She was part of the session. How did you want that to make a soup can? Making a movie, yeah, of her life. She was like, well, how about him? What the hell was he? Yeah. Hey, Andy. You're fair. Other than that. Let me have break. That's part of that whole sued culture, you know. Exactly. Well, we're just not intellectual enough to understand that. That's way over our heads. This is correct. So, the guys like Ernest Timmingway, they used to hang out in the bar, you know, all their whole life. Every waking moment where like their liver was just a petrifying by the second. They would understand any Warhols art. We're just, we're just old Zeus lobs, hang out at the track. Yep. Trying to catch a bet. Trying to get that slot machine to ring a ding ding. Well, it's a story on that. We heard any more about that or what's the deal? May 1st. May 1st. What? slot machines. Where? There'll be an old war at all four. Well, I'll be there. I might just have to make this summertime visit to Pompano Park, you know. I think some of them are trying to get it done earlier, but I know that's what streams target date is. By the way, they changed the name of Hollywood Dogtrak. Yeah, Hollywood Dogging, the kid and slots or whatever it is. Well, I heard a commercial for it. They don't even mention Hollywood Doggut. They talk about this place. This entertainment complex in Howandale. What's it called, Shai? I forgot. It's a very catchy name, whatever it was. Like festival or something like that. Yeah, it's a very nice place. Yeah, it's a very nice place. Yeah, it's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. It's a very nice place. Well, you have a nice day. Oh, easy for you to say. We'll see if we can, oh, that's streaming is up. Oh, my God, we're streaming at the internet. At least it looks like it anywhere. Oh, are we making progress or what? Go talk to stuff, maybe he'll tell you some stuff. Okay, before you leave. I will. I don't want you to be in the dark. Yeah, exactly. Now, I know. You're on. And I know what I want to talk you about tomorrow. Yeah. Because we don't have time today. And that's our stiffy. The sales manager, what you give in that name. Yes. And at the time, I was, because I, you know, I've only seen the guy. I think twice in my life. Like the last time I was there, he went running the other way. He saw me come to the door. But that's, that's a perfect name. Well, he must be very busy today, because we don't have any spots on the air. Yeah, exactly. Well, it's kind of hard to sell when you're not talking to the talent when you don't communicate with him. It's kind of hard to do what being involved in the sales department. He's like back in a little cocoon there. He must have, oh, and I'm going to say this to you, which will be a shock to you of all people. Speak into your suspensions. Yeah. But screw-in aside from the personal stuff, and she was a miserable bitch, but aside from that stuff, she was 100 times the sales manager or whatever that we got now. Even you would have to agree with that. Come on. Screw-in? Screw-in. We had spots on a lot when screw-in was there. You, you might have. Oh. She, uh. Okay, send. Have a great day. Not to the, not have a great day. Okay. I'm interested in the bud. I was going to say something. But don't. Okay. The less said the better. I'm being quiet. Sing a bye. Bye. See you. Just, just, just, just, just tell me what you're problem. You're a great, great, great actor, still allowed. The government is still in your face. They both bend those where I don't belong. So they can eat and drop on you. All you should do is write to go away. They can put a camera in your room. Four fibers wouldn't be surprised. They're both in the grace now. Now you'll know what's everybody's right. To new something I'll write with a pre-embo day white behind. Back home. Okay. To her stuff. But my friend, mom, said it now. Find out my phone calls. Can be a tap. The top of my seat. They can do that. It's a rare thing. Boops are out. They're right up in. She can't do. So, but I'm worried. To have no private life. To do. To do. Ten or four ten. Happy Tuesday to this every twenty seventh of all was nice. Confambulating with muffub briefly this morning. And I guess we got a couple of engineers in there. Right? Yeah. We got a couple of people in this station. A couple of people in it. Not too many. They don't want to overdo it because this is a week for a screw-in-off. And we're making a big transition now. We don't know the transition to what. We're making a transition. I think a format change is in order. Yeah, music. We laugh about it. All right. I'll start from the problem. Music. Here I can go. Go out there and buy all kinds of good crap. The music of your life on WQAM. Nothing like music on AM man sounds like it's having to a sprainer. Oh, and speaking of music obviously a lot of people. I should have probably put that on there on the pool about the satellite radio. What? About people that haven't because of the music. For example, I've got 80 people are going to get serious for Howard. That's Howard Stern, by the way. 9% of the audience is going to subscribe for Stern. So you see right there for that one guy that radio guy that called yesterday give me a lecture about, Howard is not going to be happy. Yeah. 100 million year will keep me pretty happy for a while anyway. Wither without the ego. Anyway, it's already time for a break. 10-15 a QAM. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5-16 a. And now it's time for our longest investigation. It's from Hank or Bug. Any right? Please play the air that I breathe. And dedicate it to my Kim Bass and your blow up doll. In theaters now, from the director of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. What's the next phone of the sound? It's George Bush and the Goblet of Fire. How's the moments you've all been waiting for? Rarely is the question asked. Is our children learning no more questions. So not any more questions. But sort of the finest note of which craft and wizardry in the world. And you'll be under the finest headmaster that Hogwarts has ever seen. But I can't learn. There's an old saying in Tennessee. I know a syntax probably in Tennessee. There's just only one. Shame on you. To fool me. Can't get fool again. That was bloody brave. Then again, I don't have a lot of intelligence. George Bush and the Goblet of Fire. Well, maybe I need to learn a communicate better. Good-bye. The 20 past 10. We could only wish. It's, you know, the crossover is yesterday and today. Maybe I'm off my feed because I'm recuperating for my trip. What about him? This is a week, very week. Hank and me, very week. And those are all the deposits that dead air. We just, that's because the whole place is in limbo now. So there's not too much to talk about. Right. You think that's got to be? It's got to be it. Good-bye. The lot of those takes me to it's by the way. They just coasted in here. We've got it out of first gear last night. You're a little on by the Jets. I beg of pardon? I said, I sure hope so. You hope so. I sure hope so. Well, the dolphins didn't coast on by the Jets. They had a struggle to pull out of their ass right at the end of the game. There would disage Drew Rosenhausfeld's cramps. Yeah. Well, that's how that goes. Yeah. Well, that's the dolphins. What's your take on? The Humper gave us a show today. It doesn't even realize it. Thanks Humper. Even though we've done that pull them in times. But we, I think we always did it about all time overrated celebrities. And we pretty sure. Yes. Who is today's most overrated celebrity? Which would eliminate some people like somebody old like, Rosie O'Donnell. She's not on anymore. She's, well, she's on somebody. But she's on another dyke. You know what I'm saying? No. No. No. Today's most overrated celebrity. Yeah. Yeah. People who are popular today who are either on TV or movies who are like, I'll big Valley who and they suck. Yeah. And I know I heard Hank talking about at this morning. He was saying, uh, he didn't think Jessica Simpson was pretty or Terri. Terri, I agree with you. Hank. Jessica Simpson is good looking, but she's. Oh, I didn't think he had the talent and no singing department. Well, let's put around there. I'm building my list. We have a building full today. I'm going to talk about that in the morning. Have a good burn. I heard Hank talking about that in the morning. Well, that's good. You were listening. That's very good. Good deal. What's your take on subscription radio is our full today. By the way, the sales manager, I just might do a whole week of shows on him. I don't even know him. You know, Curtis. What is his name? Curtis, uh, raven? Oh, seriously. What is his name? That's what it is. This is name. Curtis Raymond. Yeah. I didn't even know that. I'll be damned. Is that Curtis Raymond Burr? That's it. You're fair. Oh. What's your take on subscription radio? 914 votes. I'd never pay for radio 383, 42%. I'm considering subscribing 213, 23.3%. I've got, uh, serious. 129. Get serious. 129. We'll get serious for Howard Stern 88. That's almost 10% of the audiences in the subscriber series. So they can hear the Stern show. Uh, I've got XM 79. No bacon, by the way. I got paper towels, but no bacon. Oh, no. I guess probably I did the wrong thing. And there was in the wrong order. Yeah. Well, at least I got half the deal done. But then I wasn't all that crazy about going out because there was all these shootings going on. And it's just not a good idea. Dark punks with guns. What I've told you for years. Bad combination. Okay. Dark punks with guns. Six people shot. Uh, I got XM 79. So, um, serious 131 is way ahead with our crowd. Head XM and dropped it 15. Head serious and dropped it only 7. And those two categories there. Uh, people have by cars that already have it in there. It's kind of a trial deal. Yeah. I did an important job. So that's not too many though. Uh, people that had it and dropped it. How much are regular way do you want to drop that? Try it. Give it a shot. If it doesn't work the first time, just keep dropping it and dropping until it's in the next. And little pieces. Another American soldier dead in Baghdad and on top of that. Two US pilots were killed in the helicopter crash in West Baghdad last night. But there was no hostile fire involved. It was an accident and somebody got hurt. And just like to get to this wreck business out of the way in the beginning. Cause all we're fine every day just get out of the way. And the things are fantastic. Cause everybody else seems to be forgetting about the fact that we're there based on a pack of lies. And all these people are dead and dying because, uh, Oh, well, we're building democracy in another country. There were nation building is that what it is. That's the excuse to do sure now. Yes, it is. As opposed to the original thing with a weapon to mass destruction and their dangerous. They're going to attack us and he wants to build the nuclear weapons and he stole a freight train. Violence increased across Iraq after a law following the elections, where at least 2,000 people including another US soldier killed yesterday and shooting in bombings. Mostly targeting the Shiite dominated security services. The Shiite officials blamed the Shiite's influence on insurgent efforts to deepen the political turmoil surrounding the contested vote. And a part of the history of the military. Civil war is basically what's going on here, but we don't want to talk about that. Also, just a couple of things. The serial rapes us back to accused of terrorizing two neighborhoods, smiled as police officers escorted in back to jail yesterday. Today, oh, this is today. We can't forget to be escaped by climbing through event and raffling down the building using bedsheets. It was raffling on it. Give her an at raffle music. Yeah. They got it down the hall. That raffling music. A tip led detective is that's unfortunate. Tip led detective, Surrey, and although he lies, Repolo, over he was a Repoloing down the building. Who was arrested about 10 o'clock last night outside of video, Surrey and Southwest Miami said, Amis Rollhaus Jr. F. The L.E. Special Agent in charge. Amis Rollhaus Jr. Yeah. He achieved his mustache and told officers who chased him down that he was a homeless guy from Nick Aragua that he was worried about immigration detective. Alcides Bella has said, I want to be kind to Joseviles Jr. He was right. He was right. Amis Lee has not direction. Repolo 34 escaped December 20 as he waited to February trial on felony council. Sexual badwin other charges that could send him to prison for life. We can only hope he's accused of sexually assaulting seven women and girls ranging from 11 to 79, he forced him to arrest him. And he just got out. Happens to the best of him. And speaking of slime, former Major League pitcher Jeff Reardon was charged with the jewelry store robbery and held pending a bond hearing today in Palm Beach Gardens. The 50 year old Verdon walked into Hamilton Jewels at the Gardens Mall on Monday and headed in Employee and notes saying he had a gun in the store as being robbed, a window Palm Beach Gardens police. What I tell you about slime balls with gun. Reardon fled the store and understores him on a cash, police found him at a nearby restaurant. Recovered the stolen money and should be what maybe he just had to get some money for a meal. You know, could I? With arm robbery. The four-time all-star was 73 and 77 with 365 seven saves and 3.6-thene ERA and 16 seasons with the Metz expo's twins Red Sox Braves since in any reds and the jankies. Jeff Reardon fallen hard times. Let's take a picture for him. What do you say? I'm all set. All right. Let's get somebody out there. Let's take Miguel. All right. He's probably not there this week. He's also on a busman's holiday. Yeah. Haven't seen him. No. Once we'll see much about fat boy here, and materialize it all or not. Who? No. Haven't seen him. Thank boy. I'm dying all the hair. I'll be damned. Maybe he died. We just haven't got the message yet. Ooh. Twenty seven past ten at five, 60 WQA. I've been telling you by drug concepts for a long time.

It's a real life-action adventure game that uses the streets of South Florida as a game board. Start begins at Concession Strain A of Joe Harvey Stovie. Where each contest has to drink himself to oblivion. They were against the highest blood alcohol level first. It goes on to level maybe two. They're going to be in the right way. They run down the desk and the hall has home section of the game. They're a three-four game police department. And you can have us come up with a different view to go on a good news license. They're off to the Bible or it doesn't board games. Higher in a journey. Go in, of course. And whoever gets off with the easiest sentence wins. It's ours who's gone for the whole time. The eye can drive like Rick Sanchez for game. That's what we should do. That's what he wanted. I just noticed I got a very urgent story here in the bottom of line of this. This is bad. It's missing. And anyway, mind me being a Miramar based. Vibes Radio has been choked on for operating without an FCC license. But hopes to return to Caribbean program to their ways in the near future. You know, you people out there with your parrot radio stations. You need mental health. Okay, there's something basically wrong with this whole concept. Well, I'm just going to start a radio station for my hood, you know. Yeah. Although the FCC called the Vibes Radio Apparel Operation, it never acted one like one says, Durand Simon writes in a hero. Instead of a client-distan operation, tucked away in a back alley apartment head of website and a Miramar Orphus. From those five years, Vibes DJs broadcast music, community service announcements and commentary and Caribbean politics and immigration issues. But the FDLE shut down the popular Caribbean team station in October, vending it for operating without an FCC license. Oh, Bob, we don't need no FCC license. We're just going to go on here and play radio. I mean, look at QA and we don't kind of know FCC license. We're playing radio, kind of. Right? Right? So it goes to Shoya. Vibes representatives said they hoped to return their ways and wouldn't broadcast until they have a license. I see. It's like the community has lost their list of Iranian Francis 41. We're playing Francis 41 of Miramar, probably Kinder are lean Francis. Now they don't know what's going on around them. Well, open window and look outside. You'll see what's going on around. Y'all kinds of fun stuff. Vibes offered him music and news from Jamaica, a man and other parts of the Caribbean Francis said. The family has hooked on shows like Point Blank at two hour talk show. And the Sunday Rice and Tees, they taprated old school music show. He said, oh, they were playing at old school style. They were kicking it, uh, old illegal style. They give you more than music they inform your friends to say, when I listen to Vibes, it's like I'm right in Jamaica, mine. Vibes representatives said they were surprised when the FCC shut them down. How do you like that? Surprise, huh? And then there's a Al Firaan, I guess is the founder of this thing. His company in vibration one construction permits from the FCC. In a 2004 auction for $1.3 million to build two FM stations in Perian Cedar key two north Florida towns. They hooked to least time on a south Florida station for Vibes, applied for license for the north Florida stations, and transferred that signal to south Florida. But in vibration defaulted on a down payment in December 2004 and lost the permit FCC record show. Firaan said the company didn't have the full amount by the deadline paid 70 grand based on advice from their attorney. It was enough to cover the payment for one station Firaan said in vibration is appealing. But the FCC says the station has lost a chance to appeal in vibration alert about 60 grand according to the FCC papers. Pirate stations like Vibes could undergo more scrutiny in the future thank God, a new anti-Pirate C-Log that took effect last summer makes it a third-degree facility to broadcast with adolescents or interfer with signals of license public or commercial stations in Florida. The legislation in power is law enforcement to rest Pirate's and seize their equipment. No one from Vibes was arrested but equipment was seized and a partridge in a fair trade. Many of south Florida's Pirate stations, by the way, are the two of the largest Pirate cars have Caribbean programming on John Jabun, host of south Florida speaks out of South show on WSRF-1580 one of the two Caribbean owned stations in south Florida. So Caribbean people feel their issues are ignored by other radio stations. The Caribbean community is still searching for its voice. Jabun said they're searching for their voice. Well, there it is. So in other words, we'll put our own station on. We'll just do whatever it help we want. We'll stick our own thing on. Grace that. Kind of making up as we go along. Otherwise, if I call during the break and he's still alive. He's still alive. Still here. And he said. His birthday is actually Christmas day. So there you go. I really couldn't care less. Right. I'm the only band that is as he celebrated another one. And by the way, nice job on a copy. The one that is spared on December 16 on his way to Armstrong for right now. Is he really? That's right. Well, I'm sure that's going to do us a hell of a lot of good by the end of the day today. Let's see. Are they running a spot today? Probably not. Yes, they are. Well, he's got an hour and a half to get that all taken care of, which I'm sure he won't. Yeah, this tells the problem. We read, I know the audience probably tears a hear me. Viction, moan and scream about that. And many other things too, but too bad. My show. And it's just, we reach crisis beyond crisis levels with this crowd. It's just, it's pathetic what's going on here. Or what is not going on. And then what you told me yesterday, or what somebody told me, I don't think it was you with somebody sounded like you. Yeah, about people back there and they were not selling because the rates were so high and the station doesn't get anybody any results. I'm sure the people across the street be delighted to hear that. Be sure and buy $790 because QM don't get anybody any results in their rates are like a 50 cent of a hour. It used to be a dollar hour. They couldn't sell that. So now it's more like about 40 cent. About 30 minutes. And a hour. About a 30 for the, I think it's $3 for a dollar. If you want a hour. Oh, a dollar. So let's get back to this pool now because I'm just, I'm in the bag still from my trip. This is the worst I've never had taken me days to like recover. I feel like I'm in a coma. In fact, maybe somebody ought to like disconnect my tube. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Who was today's most overrated celebrity? Somebody who's big now. Very popular now. But we don't know why. Let me put Bill Marr on there too. Okay. Okay. I'm going to make this list. And then I'll pass you to Eric later on. Maybe we're on one o'clock. Because the thing with a satellite deal, I think we've already pretty much, we'll leave that up for a couple hours. Kills from good time. Who is today's most overrated celebrity? Here's what I got so far. Paris Hilton. And she's ugly and she has no talent. But other than that, she's great. We have no idea what she does. Other than that, it's spent a lot of a daddy's money. She's got a nice allowance. Donald Trump. Nice here. Martha Stewart. She bases him fantastic brownies. Howard Stern. Got a lot of people in this crowd. Like Howard a lot. And they will pay to hear him on serious. But there are also a lot of people. I wonder what's the, where's the beef? You know, they have listened and they, they would like to get paid for listening. Jessica Simpson. So, and I was at Hank that said she didn't look all that great. Yeah, Hank doesn't think she's, I don't know, guy don't agree. I think she looks just fine. She's not as pretty as Tom Brady for example. Well, I'd say what? And you sure look good last night. He shaved all that schmutz office face. He looked nice. Nice and clean for the Super Bowl. He's clean enough his act a little bit. What? For the Super Bowl? What are you laughing at? Nothing. They're, they're, they're rounding in the shape now. Although, Timmy Brouske and her last night didn't help any. But they're rounding in the form. In case you haven't noticed, I noticed. And in fact, you should probably have noticed a couple of weeks ago when it played your team. But nevertheless, and Bill Mar, a legend in his own mind. He just, he leaves me so cold and limp and there's so many people out there including this audience. Oh, man. He says all the stuff he rips bush and all and he's like, I, yeah. Whatever. He's just a twerp. How about Terri? Who the hell is Terri? I probably don't know who she is, but she, she's been in the American pie movies. And she has a show on E. I know who that is. Is an REED-Vyzen-Great-R-E-I-D. The separate that, so we wouldn't be confused with Gregory. Right, I'll do that. Who's leaving WQA-M at the end of the year? We're wish him all the best and we hope he leaves very, very fast. Because he did it his way. Don't forget about that. He's doing it his way. And he is doing it his way as opposed to having like a little bit of class. And saying, hey, guess what? Here's what the deal is. And here's the look. Let's keep everybody in the dark, okay? So that tells me because of that fact. That's probably all those rumors that we heard before. It's probably not his choice, you know? Somebody has probably showed him where that door was. And hey, great. Here's the door. See ya. Like that. WQA-M, hello. Not there, I'm lying to. Not a good start. Yesterday was fantastic on the phone. I don't know why. Me either. We may not duplicate that again for a long time. WQA-M, hello. Richard Simmons. Haha. WQA-M, hello. That's who they deal. Yes, sir. I got one for the poll. How bad. Jennifer Lopez. I hit that bitch. Okay, I'll put her on her, but she's like old news. And she's like, what if she do now? She's at least the making some crappy movies. But she's a old news. I'll put her on her. I'll put anybody on her is like a popular now, or at least ten my popular. I guess we could put Ben Affleck on her too, huh? Okay. That works. Is that work for you? Yeah. So many. I mean, I just see these people on them. And of course they're all, all those entertainment shows, you know, ET and inside edition and all. And they're very latest and greatest on the who they're doing and what they're doing. And they wonder, well, who who who really cares? I mean, why would I care about anybody care about that? Why would even those people care about it? I wish I could answer that question. Yeah. But no, nobody can. It's it because we're supposed to the media tells us we're supposed to care about that. And I haven't done it for a long time. That's the new deal with the media. What stories like the chicken and rouba? Oh, you've got to be whipped up into a frenzy about that. She disappeared. Where the hell is that bitch? Don't know. Don't care. Kind of like Jeff Heiz birthday. Well, it was a young decent looking white girl. So, you know, like I see. Suppose it would have been old like old and you're mama. Then we wouldn't have cared so much, I guess. No. We got Moa to the Saturday noon speaking of old. Old Moa. Not as old as I am, but he's getting there. He's in fact he's going to pass me like I'm standing still. Old Moa to Curtis Stevenson for the mad dog. Mad dog is finished up with his hard work for the year. Once he him no mole this year. Hurricanes warm up with seven o'clock. And then they stretch and hadters. I wonder if they're kind of the mad headers. The steps and headers at the Hurricanes basketball. Ninth or ninth or out of a tremendous number of people. Not turned man. Who need you for that crap? And Jesse Agre follows the basketball game until 2 o'clock in the morning. That's just about says it all. This is new Roger. This is 516A. Yes. The holiday season. Everyone loves Christmas carols. But until now, no one has ever written holiday songs about that. Other big holiday this summer year. That's right. I said until now. Introducing kind of good carols on TV. The carols always find it's my space. They say something new. He's new to it. It's now even your novice. I'm actually carrying on TV. It's like a vehicle. As a gift of hours and hours of holiday music. To get you into the other spirit of the season. On the day. The day of concert. On my mom. Okay. 8 hours. Top with us. 7 slabs of concrete. Just let the lock. 5. It's not a game. If you're tired of the old traditional song. They used to hold the tradition. You'll get tired of almost before you know. You better buy gifts.

It's over. 10. 46 happy to know could all you folks out there celebrating. Lighting the candles and giving the gifts every day into the whole thing with the menorah and the Canohar. We got 995 votes on the pool. Our goal is a thousand. What? Yeah. I think we got a shot of that. Panthers play definitely pretty tough. Last night then lost in the shootout. Damn. Three to two. I'll be there. They had one. One. One. One. And then it was a two. Panthers. And then it was a two. And then the. No no scoring overtime. And they lost in the shootout. And that's just any interest. I did not. Now, would you be going tomorrow for the Bruins game? Yes. To put in a couple hours there, so you can scan. I mean, get a little goose up your. That's right. Your hours. Right. Good. Good. Thinking. And then get there a lot of every for the game. There's there's a team ready for the pickings. The Panthers are to kick their ass tomorrow. The Bruins think. Panthers are to kick their ass. 5. 6. 5. 6. 7. So liberty. These clothes out of these smoke and right now. There's like thousands of people out there that we hear about just I give you another one. How about Sarah Jessica Parker. I agree with that. Totally. She just in every way, not just to appearance, which speaks for itself, but just in every way she grosses me off. I find her an objectionable creature. But it starts with the appearance. I mean, she really looks like a witch. Yeah. But she not. Oh, yeah. I just I. Blurb here for Charlie in the chocolate. Perfect. You know, a big Johnny Depp fan. That way was on my TV on a plane. You know, you have your individual TV in the business class. Yeah. And for some reason, I was watching, I don't know, too much of it. And it was just, I know it's a kids movie, but God, it's just so bad. Yeah. Well, yeah. I didn't see it because it just looked really weird. Well, no, it's not for you. It's a kids movie. It's not for me either. I mean, I liked having to be like Charlie in the chocolate factory or really want you know, back in the day. Yeah. Yeah. This one Charlie in the chocolate factory just looked very strange. Week. Really, week. But, you know, give Johnny another opportunity to play a really goofy looking creature. And that seems to be his main head. Yeah. He likes to play. I mean, he's very good in movies like Donnie Brasko, where he looks like Johnny Depp. And the one about to watch the one and a something at the window that pretty secret window. Secret window. The movie. Have you seen blow? I'm bigger part in. Seriously. Yes, I have seen blow. Okay. That's his best movie. I think we're going to see it blows. Nope. Do you want to do QAM? Hello. Any Neil. Yes sir. Sarah gets a parker. Is a real parker. She leaves me to live. Yeah. How about Bob Barker? How about how Zelivya? Would a smile on your face? Do you want to do QAM? Take her to the hell. Yes sir. This is Neil. This is Neil. Oh, you have to chin up. Yeah. Um, wrestling ball. No, he doesn't get it. Doesn't get it. See, yeah. Look, there's a big segment of this audience. We need to make them happy. Every day we take a poll and the answer would be either George Bush or Wershlimball. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. There's a top point. Wershlimball is not in the middle of a celebrity category. We don't see anything about Wershlimball. Except when he was doing his pill popping and stuff like that. But you know, you don't see him on entertainment tonight inside addition. He's a radio. Not see. Okay. Get with it. Get with it. When you people are going to use some, that's one of the reasons I hate talk radio. Man, I hate it. I despise it. Can't stand it. All the, all the political animals out there. Everything has to be has to come back to the same crap again. Okay. It's the holiday season. I know it's not easy. We got people dying like flies over there in Iraq. But just for once in your life, just to spend all of that crap and just a little bit on the lighter side. Just rip somebody else and ask, you know? Just send your venom in a different direction. You're a venom in South Florida. Besides poor rush. Pop it out of the one rush. That's it. WTQAM. Hello. QAM. A QA4 that change. Go Caribbean. All right. Now we're talking yam on a see answer. And everybody can smoke a big fat one while they're on the air. Run. Roll it up and news paper. Certainly not the Harold. God, would you want smoke anything and a her own thing so. WTQAM. Hello. Neil, I agree with you that. Good. WTQAM. Hello. I love the way he affects that voice to it. Takes like about a half a second and you know who it is. QAM. Who am? Who am? Who am? Who am? Hello. But he's a good. I told you to don't know what the thing here. What? No, I'm like yesterday. I knew that would not happen again any time soon. That happens like baby once. Oh, I have about out of 60 years. Who am? Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, it's big Neil. Speaking. Hey, Neil. Yeah. What's happening? How are you doing, pal? I have to be honest. How are you? I got a name for you. Jeffy Bealies. Jeffy Bealies. That's for the name. Who is it? What do you say? I have no idea. Jeffy Bealies? Yeah, that's it. Jeffy Bealies. That's the name. Okay. That's the name. 560505060. Have a little more. All day, cheer. Come on. Have some of that manage. Kevin's for a Chinooka baby. It's good for you. He'll kill what else you have to you, too. Turn your liver into like a sawdust. WQAM. Hello. Good morning, Neil. When is this? As far as yesterday, poll, I was never pay for radio. Not as long as you're on the radio. And for today, poll, I would probably say somebody like, I can't understand anybody. He just seemed to join our Melissa Rivers. Yeah, they're both around. In fact, I had to miss Fortune because I couldn't sleep at night in Amsterdam. My body clock was all screwed up. So three o'clock in the morning, there's the Larry King show with Joan Rivers sitting and talking about suicide. Oh, God. That was it. That was it. Maybe you want to blow my brains up. And of course, also had Melissa on there with us. Okay. Joan Rivers and Melissa Rivers. Let's put them under individual. Yeah, good picks. Yeah. She had Melissa on there too. And of course, she had our link letter on her who's daughter committed sausages. Melissa Rivers. What an uplifting show for the holidays. A show on suicide. High school on Larry. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 16, pound 5, 16, Verizon and singular rival, Sons, we got more Howard dated at two. Curtis Stevenson and four. A bunch of hurricane basketball crap after that. And Jesse Agler and 930 were whenever the game ends and you'll find out he's no one of the most important players in the world. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And he's a very important player. And I have no idea, but Lenin Martin has musta have some of those naked pictures of Greg and a Billy goat. And it got to be. Because Lenin, now Lenin's a good guy. He's one of the really good people around the building. Yes, yes. But he just don't belong on here. That's all. Can you look to really cross me? QAM. You can't speak. WQAM, hello. I want to play some jingles. WQAM, hello. Hey, man. How about Dr. Phil, the his protege, over Wimfree. His protege. Okay. I guess, Oprah's, she's still on. I don't ask me why I'll put that bitch on her too. And Dr. Phil, now there is some real swill Dr. Phil. See, he's another one at this audience would like to have on her report. But in this case, rightfully so. One of the biggest frauds, one of the biggest con artists. And then he writes a book about dieting and he happens to be fat. But other than that, even he's got a fat head like Hank. Dr. Phil's got a fat head. You know what I said? I did. The bad part about it here is that CFC and CFCONus, which is the best local channel for news. I watched them every night religiously at six o'clock. Right before their newscast is Dr. Phil. So I try to make, I try to time it so that they're in the last commercial before. In other words, he doesn't come back on because I just don't want to see him runes by day. WQAM, hello. WQAM, hello. I get Neil. You were talking a little bit about, uh, both. About bull. That's the top of the bull. Oh, oh. I was wondering when you thought they wouldn't be as good a worker. I was waiting to see what I would go about bull. You know, a little bull people. Okay, take a peek at this. WQAM, hello. What about those CUNYMX times on the view? No. WQAM, hello. No. Perfect name for your poll Tom. Tom, true. Is overrated, uh, screamer. And Tom, Hank. Is he still around? I guess. I think he's still alive. I'm not sure. He's alive. Okay, Tom, how are you? He's alive. He's alive. Oh, that's right. He's one of those goose steppers. Yes, he is. Okay. That's a Philadelphia. And also goose steps. Thank you, pal. Yeah, that's right. Very hard to figure that out. Kind of like a Robert Gruper, you know. Well, those self-hating deals. Oh, is this life great two minutes? Is that what I'm seeing? Yeah, but I made it three. Oh. Because the first two minutes are trade outs. This is going to be an all trade outs sweep coming up. Yes, it is. Okay. All trade outs in his break okay. Mark it down. This is Neil Rogers. Oh, this is five sixty two eight. This is the Neil Rogers show. This is your brain. Any questions? This is some stations. Look if you can. Some stations. Look if you can. But another station. Because this station is going to give you a chance to redeem the sins of all man. Guys, that's right. We're going to crucify you. Neil, you did a grunt. Being a big hero. Our Jerome Rune, Jim, even have a little magnetic dash towards that you made in your image. Just be the head color. When you hear this letter. And we'll set a bunch of angry Romans to drag you out. Cut you up and nail you down. If you've got a hammer and nail, we'll put you up for the night. This station accepts no responsibility for we know not what we do. We're deemed a sins of all man. Guys, it's crucify. He's listening for your chance to redeem it. Why sure like that. This station accepts no responsibility for we know not what we do. I can say is a man to that. 137 votes are goal was a thousand. So we're going to wait over the top. We're going to have one killed in six loaded in Canadian shootings. Three. Search crazy. They just kind of like soft right over that. Who cares about those Canadians anyway? You idiots on CNN. Hope you all croak. Once you take on subscription radio, we ask thousand and thirty seven votes. This is our, this is a current poll. I'm not going to be confused with Tomar's poll. And then the one for our Thursday. I'd never pay for radio for 1939. I don't blame you. 42.3 percent. I wouldn't either. The crap that's on who'd have to pay for radio. I'm considering subscribing to it in 35. I've got serious 150. 14 and half percent of the audience are serious. Well, get serious for how it's for 98. That's a little over nine percent. I've got a 792. That's 8.8 percent. That's how I guess is for redneck truck drivers. What it's really basically for? Yeah, I don't know about that. Did you know that? Well, that's what Joe Costello told me. He had a no-one. Worst for XM. Well, he does the NASCAR. That's why they didn't want me on there is because all they just couldn't imagine and truck drivers. Listen, that, they have a faggot knee or Rogers on the air. Oh my God. We don't want to aim my XM. We don't want to know some of you faggot like that for money or whatever the hell he is. Yeah, I'm telling you. That was the a-mine named got tossed around there too. Oh no, no, we don't want that. M-doll-boi's ain't got a con to that crap. So 92 with XM, 150 with serious. You see that almost double. I had XM and drafted 16. I had serious and drafted 7, so more than double. So XM sucks and serious, I guess it was worth it. The court of these even though serious is a got only like they're less than half the subscribers so far. But when you consider that over 9% of this audience says they're going to get serious when Stern goes on there, which they've got a serious pretty soon because he's going on January 9th is it? Yes. How do I know that? If I see it like how many thousand times in less couple of ways it's kind of like a greened mine ever show that you turn on. Right. Yeah, that's right. Even on the cartoons on a kitty channel, even on Nickelodeon, even on the oldies shows, there he is. There's Howard. The King of all hype make no mistake about it. How many QAM hello? I don't know how I say. But he goes here. All right. Hey listen to him. People need to get serious and get over the first paying for serious radio. I think a lot of people are just curious to hear what Howard's farm is going to scream out or say on the mic. More than actually being serious about listening to the radio. About for your poll. Yeah. The gentleman or lady, whatever you want to call it. Kevin, does that mean that's on attached to beneath spirit? Do you know what I mean? Kevin said her line. But he, yeah, what I'm saying, I'm pretty sure. Yeah. I understand that but he's the guy. Well, if you understand that, the poll question was, who was today's most overrated celebrity? So when he says I understand that, but he, right, though, I mean they've made him. Okay. I mean, that's totally disagree with because it's the holidays and because I'm like still recovering from my ill-fated trip. Kevin said a line. All he's done knocked up a couple girls and he's not a celebrity though, but I guess I know celebrity shows he's a celebrity. And I guess maybe that's exactly. Like I said, I apologize to the call or you got your thumb right on a baby. I mean if Josh agrees with how am I. What do I know? And old told like me, what do I know about Kevin said a line of an ugly and schmutzie and grow test? And she's sure ought to be doing a lot better than that. Oh, man. She could be doing anybody in course for all we know maybe she is. You know what I'm saying? Maybe it's not his baby. That's correct. She could be doing any guy that she wanted to be doing any chip that she wanted. She could be doing like anything a line, any animal. Trees, plants. I'm actually, since they're, I guess they're split up. I'm sending in my resume because I thought you were offered her so to speak. I thought that's okay. I'm pretty in there for you. I'll be there for the kids. I'll be there for the kids. I'll be those medic guards. You and George have been peddling for a long time now. Sounds like star graves to me. Now that he's out of the picture, I'll send everybody else once back in. So to speak. Line 9, Josh is favored. QAM hello. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Three. Yeah, I know you were. Listen, I want to know if anybody has ever seen Tom Aswell. And Christian, Amon, poor in the same frame. I think it's the same way. And double dates over there. Tom Aswell. He's at MFBC's over in Baghdad. I have no idea who that is. Tom Aswell. He looks just like Christian and Amon, though. I mean, it's the same guy. Maybe she's like double-dipping. Yeah, I think. Yeah. Listen, um, three or four. Yes, sir. Aaron's daughter. What's the whole day in Tory's? Yes. Oh, no. How are you doing? My dad. Okay. I thought you were so very nicely. Yes. One shameless request. In closing, yes. In closing. Um. Quices goes back to when the bird was around. And I asked you, I think about a year or so ago. I don't know if he even played it because I was a rapper to her. But it was a talk up with Rick and Tiki. I think he was drunk or something. I wasn't him. It wasn't him. It was somebody that, uh, it was a guy that sounded like him. That was doing a take off on him. Oh, I got it. It sounded like a character somewhere. Yeah, but you wouldn't bird laugh your butt. Right. Really funny. No, not. How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? And if I did, I wouldn't know what would be under anyway. You got it on a character. Were you never find it? Plus you're not in a room anyway, are you? No. I can go in there. But, yeah. No. No. I'm not sure if I can find it just they were your are and, you know, the good news is that we actually had. I got a log here today. There's nothing on it. I can trade out spots. We said they were going to log. And Josh was able to give it to the student our studio. And we got to were streaming it. Now, we actually streamed our edges. Yeah, we really are. It's. We are streaming today. Hallelujah. It's. It's a bus. Yeah. We really are. We are streaming today. Hallelujah. It's people we apologize for Friday. And yesterday, we were all screwed up in a linge in here. Because everybody's taken off. It's a bus mentality. So, you see, I don't like that when people come in and break people to show and tell me stuff. And I don't want to say anything about that. I don't like that. You know what I'm saying? What do you say? It's just, I don't like that. I don't like having to like, there's nothing really big top secret about that. But not way till next week, you know. I'll wait till the coast is clear. But with a certain people, everything is always. Everything is always like a big secret. And you've got to go out of the room or Georgia's. It's just, ah, I can't deal with it. No, no, no. Grow up, you people. Will you please? Grow up. And by the way, it's been nice knowing you. Tough. WDQAM, hello. Yes, never, under? Speaking. Hey, how you doing? I got one for your poll. How about Bono for you, too? He's annoying. Oh, god. Am I a parrot of his crap man? Is this guy's going to save the universe? You know, he's going to save the whole world? Yeah, he thinks he's due to this. Exactly. And he looks a little like him too. Now that you mentioned it. Thanks for not, pal. No, for. Oh, okay. Bono. He's just, uh, YouTube. He's not what, uh, what's the name said? Julius Caesar, YouTube bottle? I think that's what he said. He is a grotesque. They're music. They don't do any music. They suck YouTube. And he just, uh, painted the ass. It's just like, I saw, what, where the hell was it? There was another one of these, uh, Bob Goldoff things. There's need to do another one of the tsunami, uh, business of the earthquake. I'm not really sure which disaster he's involved in these days. And they're all singing to say, we are the world. We're singing fast as we can. We're singing by the record and, uh, everybody gets the money. The starving people in Africa. It's just, it's just so assynign, man. You don't know whether to laugh or cry. You know, and you see, all these people who are involved in this. Each one of them could write a check for like five million bucks. It would be like, you or me or, well, I would be like me, uh, you know, five bucks. And like Josh five cent. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. But they gotta get some names out there. Give, give the money. Okay. Give the money. Give the food. Say, say, the people are starving right now because by the time that you record this crap of yours and assuming anybody would buy it. And by the time the royalties get distributed and by the time the few bucks are all these people you're all worried about starving, they're not going to be dead anyway. God, it's so freaking stupid. It's part of the, the inninity of humanity, man. I like that landy and any of humanity. What a calamity, Jane. Five, six, seven, eight. If I sound incoheritous because I really am. This last trip this was ill advised. It was just not good. You still have it hard time, maybe even this morning. What do you mean by that? Send a little groggy coming on. The groggy is the word and you want to know why probably I slept too long. That business about sleeping the extra hour. That's not a good idea. That idea. Yeah. Because groggy leaves you foggy. And I feel like I'm in a fog at this point. I'm all fogged up. WQAM. Hello. Hey, great show, Seth. WQAM. Hello. You're going to need 44, uh, Wayne. You're going to need 40. He's big today.

I'll pass it up, Pam. I'll move to DC. If I tell you, it's a moment in crime. Every time it calls me, which I wish you'd stop doing it about a hate-sit-like poison there. Anyway, who's the other little girl? What's her name? The one, hally, hally. Oh, geez. You know what I'm talking about? A little teen blonde. She's not really even cute. Oh, you know.

The goal is to open 100 votes. We've got a thousand 85 on a serious and next something. I guess about a new null. Put this thing up. Oh, a fax at Eric. Okay. A fax at Eric about the 20 till noon. I'll give him plenty of time. The fact that he can actually hear us. We're streaming today. A little incoherence. Still from that awful trip. Yeah, my head is foggy. That's not good. I need to clear my head. And nothing. It's, I think it's the change in me because in Amsterdam, it's, it's very, very humid. It's damp. Yeah. It's like, it's like, this time of the year, I call it the Amsterdam drip. It doesn't usually rain really hard. It can for periods of time. In fact, the day that I got there, we could go Saturday. It was, it was like drizzling and then it was like half snowing a little bit. And then it was like snow pellets. It was like a little bit of everything. Ooh. Yeah, nasty. And that was really, really nasty. But the other days, it's like during the day. It's like somebody turns the faucet on and it starts dripping up in a sky. It's just that little drip dip that annoying. You know what I mean? Not raining hard. You know what I mean? It's just your took. Sounds visible. Yeah. And exactly. Now I think you got your thumb up. That's like this. It's real rubbish. This is by 62. If there's a butt I smell a feeling. Time for your animal. Or it's me's mom. Not another animal. Kids, yes, hey, getting animals.

It damn they're killing them. Okay. 11 17. Too much of that stuff. Okay. I came from my voice mail. Let's play all the voice mail again. And I'm not, not, I don't believe them out. Or not. Is the case maybe. Yeah. I should've asked Hank what that sponsor was. They got suspended for knocking. 567. 560. Town 560. And he Verizon and Singular Rhinos lines. That's a good idea. Let's work on getting suspended for a rest of the year. Then we can do like everybody else there. I just grew off. My clearance. There's another one with his Jaguar. I, you know, there are a couple of times last night. It just popped into my mind that you told me that. And I just started chuckling like out loud in myself. Luckily, I was, you know, sitting alone in the room there. But just, I just can't even conceive of that. Yeah. He got one when, uh, screw on left. It would be like, you mean the Jaguar? Yeah. But we like trying to envision McCullock, McCullock, Colton as, um, a drab and a Jaguar, you know. I'm talking about when he was like 10 years old. Seek him with Michael Jackson. How about him? Should we put him on earth? I'm doing a movie. So what about his pain in the ass kid brother? I mean, I don't think they do anything. Do they? I don't know. I'm not, I'll wait. Come to QAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. Hi. Is this a radio show? Which show is that? Um, sports radio. You call a sports show or then you arrived your show? Yeah. Right. Yes. Um, yeah.

I don't listen to it. I don't listen to it. As far as music is concerned, listen to my own music. I got CDs. I mean, you know, it's just, I don't, I don't need somebody else to play music. I don't want, maybe 1 out of 35. I want to hear it again someday. You know, that's the, that's the idea of enduring music. But hey, that's just me. What do I know? 42% would never pay for radio and I'm with them. I mean, what's so great that you'd pay to listen to it? I'm considering subscribing to 44.

It's 1131-29 till noon at QAM. Why did that strike me so amusing? I don't know. I don't know because we got 113 votes on there. And I just, the facts today were to pull the new one. 11-0-3. So believe that up for a while until a fast-riding until Eric hits this other one. This was over. So fast-riding a birthday yesterday. We still live for it. What a shame. That's okay. We still got a lot of work to do. It was actually Christmas day. But we'll all be down. Okay. The birth of our Lord. 5-6-7-0-5-60 pound-5-60-neverized and singular wireless line. That's the fact Jesus to you by the way. It's that point. I just crank this thing up and I can hear myself. Now, if you have a little bit better. Maybe the fact that I had to like, kind of like muddy. You know? And I was like talking muddy. You think that was it? That was it. WQAM. Hello. What the... Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't ya? Yeah. Got one. Excellent job, pal. Keep bringing that phone. 5-6-7-0-5-60. You see, I just cranked that thing up so I can hear it a little bit. Now I sound like almost animated. That's all it takes. It's compared to before. And my nothers have just my imagination. You're very animated. Animated. Like that. Eminem. Eminem. Oh, there's another one. Oh, let's put him on right away. Eminem. You know, I mean, if you want to be black, do like Aljoison Lury Parks did. Put some black face on. You know, if you want to be black, and can work. But he's a pathetic. WQAM. Hello. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Happy. I was doing my bond for the poll. Ellen DeGenereth. She, at least me, very limp. The limp is not the word. Have a good one, buddy. And back to you. Ellen DeGenereth is good for nothing. And there actually are people who like her or of course they're all paid. But nevertheless, I don't see what the deal is there. There is no talent whatsoever. She's funny. Does she look really great? No. Is she, uh, nothing. Well, maybe that's what he was. But she danced. No. Huh? That said, maybe that's what it was. Nobody liked her. So she said she was gay. And that she has that population. No, no, I don't think so. If you don't have this one, I'll say that. Will be. Will be. How many QAM? Hello. Hello. Yes. And they're for poll. Okay. Pucked city or P daddy. Whatever his name is this week. Okay. I don't know what the hell he ever did. But faked in the pan at all. He sucks. Same man. Pardon. Yeah. And how do we put him on? P. Did he? P. Did he? Just did he? P. Oh, what a P. Did he? Did he? Yeah. Ha ha ha ha. Talk to that. He did he did he? And I think duty is the operator word. He sucks. Although he is. Hopefully was doing jail. Or she's another one of those faked hugs. You know. Then I flagged P. She's been around the block. Yeah. And then she was also. She was married to that ballet dancer. Who I think was going out with Ron Reagan Jr. The ballet dancer. That's just a faked magnet. Okay. We got that pull. I don't know how long it's going to take care of you. Oh, look at that. Nice job, Eric. Man, he must have been a big hurry for lunches. I mean, for doing that work. Okay. So I don't even need to print the other one out. Do you care about the other way? I just gave the result. Yeah. There we got over 1000. And how would it? We got over 1100. Okay. There is now we can do the other one. Two ways today is most overrated celebrity today. I'm trying desperately to get this back on here. And I want to. Why is this not going back? Oh, there it is. Well, that's clear. The crap out of me. Who is today's most overrated celebrity today? Not somebody for a month or two years ago. Not somebody who's a politician. Celebrity, or at least a quarter of the media. Now, this is going to be a tough one. How do I have the right to side who to vote for? Uh, the question. Huh? So that's a good question. I'm going to vote for Sam. I'm not going to vote for Tom Cruise because he at least did make some good movies. Yeah. I'm going to vote for Sam. He's a good actor. That's at times. I hate Tommy. But nevertheless, he's annoying and full of crap and hyperventilating. Donald Trump. I'm going to say per sultan. No argument there. I mean, well, she's got no talent. None. Zero. Oh, and I'm going to give you another one, too. And while I'm the same vein, of course, you're going to have to add these on. It's not going to have to write these out. Thank God. Okay. Oh, Victoria, gotty. Oh, yeah. I mean, who are we kiddin'? I mean, the pin in the ass, kids, I think I'm going to vote for her actually. Yeah, Victoria gotty. The fact that A&E puts that on the area, it's just nauseating. So what do they put those informers on for Kevin Chudo? You know, I'm with you though, like, why A&E? Yeah. You know, why? I mean, there's so many great shows that such a freaking good network. What? That's what everybody wants to know. What? Why? You know, you gotty on your girl throwing up gotty on your on your prestigious network. It makes no sense to me. Just, I don't get it. We like putting Larry King show on CNN. Oh, by the way, you know, he's gone on tonight. Because the data to promote is, remembering Rick Nelson. Now, you don't remember Rick Nelson because you're not told enough. Right? Remember Rick Nelson? I don't know. You know who he is? What? I don't think so. Really? Oh, could I? I got a ticket to my music now. I bet you're got some here somewhere. I don't know where the hell it is. Huh? Through the break, maybe I'll find it. Okay. You're on lucky. Azi and Harriet, before you were born, it was a very boring show on TV Azi and Harriet, and they had two sons, Ricky and David, and Ricky became a pop singer, a big star, a superstar, and they died in a plane crash. Towards the Ascend, where his career was basically a running, he would be down a plane crash. And then there was a little blow on a plane crash, and it blew it up for something like that. Playing the crash, he's dead. His brother David on the other hand, when it like had behind the camera, something he's still alive. Azi and Harriet, though, who were very boring and very bland, they're dead. Okay, is that kind of for you in? Yeah. Well, Rick Nelson was a big pop star. He was like traveling man and what's somebody other than, I heard a little something. Be Bob, baby, all the other, he did on walk and which pissed me off because I love fat stomolo, so really frosted my ass. But I like Rick Nelson a lot. That's you take a something. Who's kind of a pretty boy? Yeah. Four hundred and a David Cassidy, maybe. Hey David, you're fairie. Well, the one good thing is that I say good thing after they make a difference, but Rick Nelson at least was straight. In fact, he was married to Tom Harman's daughter. Oh, Tom Harman, the Paul player, Tom Harman, you have no idea who that is. You know, Tom Harman from Donnie Harman, the hardest driver. You know, Tom, Bradman. Well, Mark Harman, you got to know who Mark Harman is. Do I don't, huh? You don't know who Mark Harman is the actor. He played Ted Bundy in the Bundy movie. He's still around. I'm going to do anybody. He's got a Hillary Duff and Duff Lindsey. Come on. You don't know, Mark Harman, he was Tom Harman's son. Well, anyway, Tom Harman's daughter, who was a real hot number by the way. She was married to Rick Nelson once upon a time. And then they had those two twin, the sons, the Nelson's, whatever the hell they're name was. But the long hair, the long blonde hair looked really, yeah, yeah, nevertheless. Okay. So that's on tonight. Maybe you want to watch Larry King instead of go to the store. Oh, by the way, I know Mark Harman. I just googled him. I just, you know, I don't know him by name. Well, why not? Well, he's not really on my mind. Mark Harman and not only was an actor, but before that, he was nearly acting. He was nearly acting. There still is. Yeah, I understand it. But he was, he was a quarterback. He used to be a lay in his youth. Is that right? He was a great quarterback. He used to be a lay in the also happening. Well, when back in that day, one fine looking young man, I would happen to me in nature and think, it's course. But he was a big star. By the way, but I think he was still acting. He hasn't done anything since. Ofo. Mofo. Ofo. Yeah. But that's all right. But he's still around. You see him once in a while. You see some of those movies he was in. He can be seen. WDQAM. Hello. Yeah. No, how about Tom Arnold? There's an excellent choice. I don't know. He's not still doing anything. Tom Arnold. He's still around. Yeah. He does the best damn sport show. Oh, Tom Arnold put him on there right away. He's in the middle of nine. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. No. Oh, what put him on anyway? Yeah, okay. Now, speaking of Tom Arnold, there's somebody this, oh, and what's the guy that's on that, oh, geez. The drunk, the guy had to drink him for a second. He's on that inside edition. The glasses, pat. Right now. I'm inside the dish. You know what I'm talking about? I'm thinking. Are you know who it is? You've seen him. Right now. On inside. It's like a drunk. A radial come to us. We got to get him on too. And of course, all of the people on those entertainment shows, anybody that watches him, you need mental help. Oh, so it's like the Brits, you know, with the Elton and David and David and Elton and all this other crap. Why do we care about such nonsense, okay? Who cares? David Frost. David Frost, your ass. What is David Frost having to do with this? David Frost is a British interviewer. He, I guess he's still on a BBC. But what do you, where did that come from? David Frost. Inside edition. Is David Frost? Yeah. No. Really? Okay. David Frost. I'm telling that's what IMDV says. Yeah. Well, a lot of they know. Right. Why you laughing? Because if you knew who the famous David Frost was, if it's most amusing to think that he would be on inside edition. But we like saying, Alister Cook is on entertainment tonight, you know? And by the way, what happened to Alister Cook's bones? Did you see that? No. They sold his bones. 19 till noon at QAS. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5. 16. 8. With a quick editorial. Here's Patrick Robertson. Hello. This is Reverend Pat Robertson. The many of you have been criticizing me because I called for the assassination of Venezuela when President Hugo Schalvett. Now, before you try casting the first stone, let me clarify my statement so you don't label me some religious delicate. As these in God, very Christians, it's our job to cleanse the earth of all the evil dictators, even those who pose no imminent threat towards us. For if we do the right thing by killing people we don't like, we'll be rewarded when Jesus comes down on a gold studded chariot giving out those boxes of raisinets to all the good girls and boys, so they won't have to pay those over inflated concession prices. The next time they see some crappy rob Schneider flick, which I don't even know if that piece of crap is out on DVD. If excuse me, Pat, yes, stifle yourself. Okey, don't give in. This is Pat Robertson and you have the great day. Well, we know what network he watches now. He's watching Bob Sefer with that Okey, don't you crap? I think it's Petal Brian. Is that the drunken guy that's on one of those inside of this and shows? He's still in my head. Petal Brian does on CBS or, I don't think he does inside edition. Well, it's one of those shows. Does it make a difference with show it is? Well, you said inside it. Well, maybe it's outside edition. I don't know what that one it is. Is it even in those shows on ET, who knows? But you do know who Petal Brian is. Yes, of course. Well, that's good. Who is today's most overrated celebrity? We got to have a new poll up there. Hallelujah, baby. Here's a little something for you to think you're teeth into. There you go. Rick Nelson remembered. What makes us so bloody? I don't know. Just the way you look, I guess. And the good news for you is I have no Rick Nelson music here. I better go out and buy some today. That's good news for me. Hey, do you want to hear it? And he already says neither. It's not good. He was okay. You'd recognize someone in music. I'm trying to think travel and man. That was the most, his most, well, do a Google on it. Google Rick Nelson. Lonesome town. Kind of morbid and depressing. And then he did garden party. Don't you remember garden party? And his big comeback? Of course not. See, this is great. The fact I'm doing a show with Josh and we got no intermediate. See, George is like we have three generations on a show. We got Josh to punk. We got George who's like getting old rapidly. And then the old, the old toad me, you know. All right, I got a picture of him here. Sign and unforgettable. All time favorites for Toronto and all of Southern North. What is on your mattress? Hey, Johnny. You're fair. Anyway, what do we got? We got Dr. Phil is getting beat. 44 votes. Paris Hilton, 21. All right. Good choice. Dr. Phil 5. Victoria Gotti 3. She ain't got nothing. Except a bunch of pain in the ass pump kids. Kevin Feederline 3. I told him he belonged on her. And Jessica Simpson 3. Martha Stewart 3. Oprah's got a pair. And I bet you're their huge. When do you play? Travel a man. You want a little piece of trivia that someday might make you a lot of money on a quiz show? Yeah, what's that? The first video, the first music video. You're playing there right there. That was the first ever Traveling man. Well, the Aussie here, Aussie Nelson invented it. And Rick Nelson was singing a song. They showed these clips from all these different locations. He was singing about like a YA in California wherever. Not bad for a time. Now. Anyway, Oprah 2, Howard sperm has got a pair. Donald Trump 2, carrot top 1. We're just starting to formulate this baby. One for Bono, one for Tom Hanks, one for Sarah. Sarah Cogesica for Chris, but always called her one. I can't stop seeing it. Ben Affleck 1. And not yet for Hillary Duff, Dakota Fanning, to respelling Tom Cruise Melissa Rivers. Joe River is Jennifer Lopez, Teravita Villarve out of 52 votes. But that's just the preliminaries. Right. Wait till he audience really gets their hate whipped up into her frenzy. Take about 20 minutes. 5, 6, 7, spik and a hate. Don't forget. Don't don't. Don't don't. Don't mind who's, uh, war with the universe. So be along with two. We got Curtis for the mandog at four and then hurricane. So Jesse Agra after hurricane Vasque ball. Till about two and a more. And you tell me he's really damn good. He's good. Yeah. So if you were agonizing with letting Martens last night, you'll be, uh, crawling from Jesse Agra tonight.

Of course, we've said that many times before during the season that this game could be really ugly. And that came in and then come to find out there was a total shocker, you know. Yeah.

And there is Paula on there who had no idea what she was talking about. And she was on for two of the most embarrassing hours I've ever heard of it. And I couldn't shut it off because everybody else had the same crap on. Plus there's no. The only English language you get over there is the BBC that's obsessed with a queen and a Camilla and uh, Elton and David and David and Elton and Sky News, which is hyperbettinating with Rupert Murdoch and his bullcraft and then CNN with a plane crash of the day. The emergency. No, the one I'm talking about at Logan Airport in Boston. Yes. Well, they zoomed in on that thing, man. And he were like, I'm says, forget Paula's on there. She's a bubble hit. And at one time somebody facts this at several months ago.

A mother and father who were coming to burning apartment building dropped their two children and the armors of an LA County Sheriff's deputy early in the day. No one was seriously injured. Thanks God. Deputy Jeff Kim in a colleague were flagged down by the Watson neighborhood of 250 in a. And by a truck driver who saw planes coming from the building said Sergeant Ed Lovano, whatever his name is. Kim first caught a one year old girl who was dropped by the mother from a second store when it. We can make this into an Olympic sport. Baby dropping. And Michael Jackson's life participates. Then the children's father appeared and he dropped an annual boy. Right out the window. Kim suffered smoke inhalation and the parent mouth injury from falling down out of the way to the older child. He was at the right time to write place in all that said Lovano was at the scene. The kids in parents appeared to be uninjured. He said that the mother also jumped from the second floor. Well, second floor is no big deal. Is it? No. You know, they're going to have to do a lot better than that. I'll tell you another guy. It just leaves me limp.

From Peter Jackson, director of the Oscar winning Lord of the Rings trilogy. An epic adventure that will overwhelm your senses. Jesus. King Paul. Peter Trevor's a rolling stone calls being pawned. A back and forth adventure that will see you guessing. David Anderson of Newsweek says, King Paul will f**k up your neck and hearing a role as a main kid to come new Zasce. What's the score? No, seriously. Does anyone know the score? On December 14th. Oh, man. Eight. Eight. Eight. Eight. Oh, version of that. We'll take a video game on Atari 2600. Okay, so the King Paul really need to be we made. Oh, I asked him to be see that. Yeah, it was really good. Was it good? Yeah. Did you see the original one with a fair ray? I did. And Link Ray? I mean, technically the same thing, but it just looks a lot better. Yeah, well, of course, because now when they can do all of these things, you know, that they couldn't do back then. Or did you see that? Yeah, it was a main thing. Well, that's good. I'm glad to hear that. So let's see after City of God, and then what's the other one I'm going to watch? Happy Gilmore. Happy Gilmore. Now I already saw that. And it was okay. I mean, if I actually watched all the way through it, because, because then I recognized the scene with Bob Barker, where I seen that a million times was at the hockey games at the Panthers games. Yeah. Yeah. Did they still use that? I don't know. I still use that corny thing on the scoreboard, where they show that scene where Bob Barker comes in as knocks. Just pushes him right in the head and just bounces his head off. I scored a whole Bob. But then he rate. About 120 adults in the US is not literate in English. It's good. Meaning 11 million people like this goes to handle many everyday tasks. They federal study be showing. About 120. I think they're under estimating if he acts me. From 92 to 2003, it ultimately no progress in their ability to read sentences in progress. Or understand other print and materials such as bus schedules or prescription labels. From 92 to 2003, 11 years no progress. Zero as in. Oh. Typically do it like our friends across the street with a big O. They got nothing. Not a. I'm just shocked that you told me the nephew is in the building. That's right. Didn't he tell us yesterday that he wasn't going to come down and see his uncle? He wasn't going to be, ah, yeah. He couldn't stay away. Maybe he's going to be the new GM Chris Reed. The adult population did make gains in handling tasks that involve math such as calculating numbers on tax forms or bank statements. But even in that area, the typical adult showed only enough skills to perform simple daily activities like King Kong or Kichim, like a smirking chip. For actual sobering was that adult literacy dropped or was flat across every level of education from people with graduate degrees. Those who dropped out of high school. Even as more people get a formal education, the literacy rate in the US is not rising. A federal official said this trend is puzzling and worthy of research. Adults with ability to perform challenging and complex reading tasks made an average yearly salary of 50,700 bucks in 2003. That's 28,000 more than those who like basic skills. So are you glad that you like graduate at high school? I'm so glad. Yeah. Because you're making like a lot more than that. No? Yeah. The adult steam, a little bit of an English. Well, how about that raise? Do you go into terms and jump up and down on the desks? It's almost the first of the year. How's that raise coming out? How's it coming? Let's go. Haven't heard anything. Well, let's go. Let's get the show on the road and quickly daily. Okay. They blew out rate period. They got some other people that are like being demoted to janitor. Let's get the show on the road. And start taking care of our people. Man, the way that they nickel and dime. Nickel and dime. They got all these damn trade outs. They got Rolex watches and jaguars. They're living like a bunch of kings man. You got a bunch of queens in there. They're living like a bunch of kings. That's what I don't get. Okay. Let me get worked up about it. Okay. Well, it tells the immigrant in the immigrant English. Include people who may be fluent in Spanish or another language. Oh, no. God, cannot comprehend English level. It's English added text. It's no simple level. They like that. Unless it's when it's convenient for them. You know, people like that who. Maybe those mirrors. They most big in English. Unless, of course, you're talking about them. We're talking about them. We're talking about them, we're talking about them. And then all the same. Hey, I heard what you said. You best out of the best out of the door or did better time sometimes. You give your tongue caught on that well, one tooth. Not good. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60.

See, women come off as pretending to be so much more gentle and gentle, and that is vicious and dangerous as many elders are. Well, maybe from a standpoint of physical strength, that's true. But the fact that it matter is that when it comes to good old fashion and hate, women are right there with men, and maybe even, uh, beyond passes like we were standing still, I think. Speaking of English, speaking English, okay? It was the Kelvin's, the Kelvin's. I wonder if any she for his croaked yet. Let's check that out. 560, 560, pound 560 in the Verizon singular wireless line. Got a long way to go here. We still got 22 minutes. So, no doubt your calls before we hatch. How many QAM? Hello.

What are we going to do about those guys across the street? They stole Joe Rose. They didn't steal anybody. Okay. Somebody pushed your rose off the door and lied through their teeth to him. Okay. Which is why he hates a certain people in his building like poison. Greg, not to mention no names. But other than that, they're like, you know, they're like, not existants. So that would be something for Joe, find where what you're going to do then with the, he'll find some other price to waste at his money. And I'm going to do this is Neil Rogers.

A lot of people are born into rich families and they're money but why do they have to always be in our face? That's the question. Dr. Phil 31. Erzats. Howard Stern 23 Donald Trump 22 Tom Cruise 15.

I've been honest with you. And it's probably a good thing. I don't think most of our audience watch this CNN. Good choice by the way. Excellent. Speak very highly for the taste of this audience. Do not watch CNN. It'll poison your brain. It'll turn into Jello. And then when you least expect it, Del Thro, Ricky Tiki Sanchez on her because he's on the payroll. And they got to figure out some to do with his ass. You know how to keep him like out of prime time. Most of the time now. Yeah, they do. They threw him there in a morning for a little while. Kind of like a trial balloon. And then all boy. They went over like a hot air balloon with a hole in it. Not good. I don't even see what's in it. You're a phobeson today. Maybe it's a reprieve for me for the holidays. Eat it. It's a ball. It's a drum. Yeah. All right. Woo. Ha ha ha ha. Oh. That is really something. The people I think they just go out of the street corners. They picked these people up and they put them on here. How do you like to be on CNN? If you were cheap and just read the news off the monitor, they're just just read the school. No problem. Anyways. WQA and hello. Daniel, how you doing? Pretty good, pal. I'd like to possibly add somebody from the local scene onto that pole. Yeah. And I find this person nauseating of not just totally in it and just completely incompetent. And this person makes me nauseous. And the name is Belpiz Narei. Belpiz Narei. I don't think she's like, see, today's overrated celebrity. We're talking about big time. I don't know. Local. Spillpiz Narei. I agree with her. She gives me spillpiz too. But to just, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. When we said we're talking about big, big famous people who are splashed all over the TV. But no thanks. Plus you don't want to have to worry about how to spell it anyway, right? Actually, no, it's about. But we don't want to put her on. There's not too many roles. No, no. Now she's been on plenty of other roles of Ripper Ass. We'll do a pull next week for it. Let her, you Ripper Ass. Hey, Spillpiz. They hate to baby. Disgusting. WQA and hello. Okay, pal. I want to ask her. What do you do with the boys? Okay. Ashley Simpson. She's not her man. Okay. And another thing is. What you really think is, start your old disparity about briskness and all that. It's kind of ridiculous. I'm sick of it. Hey, didn't you get your frankincense and were this year? I'll send you some an assac man. All right, pal. Okay, don't feel left out. That frankincense and were. Yeah, all this, all these fairy tales at all. Let's, so, with a Christmas and the tree. You know, okay, it's fine. It's fun. People with a gifts and I feel obligated to spend a lot of money. It's good for commerce. You know, Hanukkah Christmas, all those other crap. So a bunch of bull crap. It's just a man made bunch of fairy tales. In fact, it was on the KLM flight. Today I had to think about the finish. In Finland is where they invented the first Santa Claus. And then the Dutch picked it up and they called him. Sot their clothes or something like that. And it was kind of an interesting thing. They had like a whole history of this crap where it came from. Man, so this guy's question. I didn't watch a close enough to be able to relate it to you in addition, which is boring. But nevertheless. It's something to do, you know, because people like ritual. They like, oh, it's a certain day of the month. Therefore, we must do this. It's a certain time of the year. Therefore, we must eat this and we must not eat that. And fill in a blanket just the way of controlling people. Of orchestrating your emotions, your actions, your finances, everything that we do. People need to be controlled. And look what a great job religion is done. Keeping people, you know, decent to each other. What a fine job we've done for dealing with each other as humans and with the animal world. And the planet that we live on, we've done a fabulous job of destroying all of these. All of these things. Pretty sad, isn't it? Yes. So that's why we don't think about it too much. Don't get too serious, because you'll probably turn on that John River show. And I know your brains out. Next time she sits in for the king. With Joan and Melissa and Art Lake Leder, who else did she have on her? Hemingway. Isn't Maryel Hemingway, or I get her confused with the one I actually killed herself? Which everyone it is. And it was some other people on there. Like I said, it was so depressing. Right in the middle of the holiday season. It was enough to make you more of your brains out. So I guess that's what they wanted to accomplish. Probably. I would think. It's fitting to want to even blow your brains out. Oh, no, no, no, no. He's coming up next. Here's your line nine again. QAM, Joshua, Curtis line. Hello. Yeah, I want to put the pole. Yes, sir. And I think. Okay. WQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. I got one for you. Paul. Uh huh. Don Aynis. Okay. That's good.

I'm going to get with it. But we're going to break our foot better than a live radio show every morning on TV. What? Just about anything. But that doesn't stop him as NBC from cheating up with radio's original bad boy. Who now looks like an SEO lady. Listen, Bernie. I'm a cell out in turn as coffee sucks. Yes, every morning. See, I miss listening to a table. Other people's cowardly business. I'm on the air. I did not have her to bite into those muckling.

He's a doubleman. What does that all about? He's a man. He's a man. He's all right. And he's only on MSNBC. A table channel. Nobody watches. And a bunch of AM radio stations. Nobody listens to. And that's something to get some fresh jingles. It's Illus. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5. 16. 2. 8. It's the. I have a child. But the truth is, had 5. 6. Oh, double you. You. And.
