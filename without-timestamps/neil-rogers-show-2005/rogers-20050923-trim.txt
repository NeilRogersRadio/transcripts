I said the weekend Saturday nights alright He doesn't mind it. I read that yeah, I know a good nice job very yeah We're gonna give very some jukus job over the sun summit You can write about radio. Oh seriously. It was a good comedy. It's about time somebody wrote something about radio on this town Tom you idiot you quizzing you bald head of geek So anyways big and involved had a geek so here that David Samson was crashing you on some statement. Yeah, that's the rumor going around How come you're not allowed to talk about the Marlin organization you know the Marlins who are not gonna make the a wild card How can we not talk about them but they can go on the other station and transfer your ass your ample ass You know I They're not the first people to go on another station and trashed my ample ass and so far it hasn't hurt me Yeah, I really don't pay attention to these you know what he's probably a little cranky because the little fella has See says playoff chances going on a drain any stadium chances which he was That's his only job with the organization get a stadium and it's not going well So he's got to go on somebody I guess he's getting to be almost as sour as your old fine brew You know How about that That statement We want to do is Or do anything to hurt them? We don't have to do anything to hurt them greatest line in the history of the human race Yeah, said you'll find bird who's the head-hunt show of the virtually non-existent 790 of the ticket whatever He says WQA is willing to do anything to hurt us You know we don't have anything I thought to myself What a cry baby what an object is here's a guy that tried to hire you He tried to hire mad dog. He tried to our virtually everyone on his radio station except me of course I'm not a sports nerd and that make too much money But he tried to our everybody on a station except well Don't go away and We're trying you're going to try to handle her damn it's called competition you jackass and I love the part about the fact that I'm a log to rip Greg Read and ask and deserve it. He's so by the way, but he isn't going to put up with it on his station They can rip each other but they're not going to rip him in other words You need to do it with a thin skin fool Joel fine brew Yeah, it calls up and it probably was pretty pretty pure that I played that Voice melody left for Greg about vocamper. We tried to you know sweeten over old pamper mean that collusion sound bite That's exactly right collusion is right don't don't pay off vocamper because I'm not going to try to harm So don't you can lowball him I still say came out of over there and he had to just step on him like an like a like a net Yeah, he could do it too anybody ever saw vocamper man He's bigger he's like a giant in the human race a friendly bit But he's a friendly guy Oh, yeah friendly time right not green too much. You know what you know and you know this too I've had guys of other stations they shot me forever I haven't have a we all yeah, I mean when I was at I would be John Moynihan used to take shots at me, you know It's just when he was over here, so he's dead now isn't he? Yeah, that's what happens that'll teach him But But you know seriously it's just you know You just I was telling the kids this morning we're talking about I said hey You just don't pay any passion to what's it difference it doesn't matter to me what they say I'm gonna command you what I do in fact that you're a mussel then you're not allowed to talk about that Organization because they're thin skin I was telling the duck mice to I was told her this morning that the reason it's very very tough to be a fan of any sports team any team in South Florida Is that the owners and the management people are of all of them traditionally through the years So all been such a bunch of thin skin hard ass Nasty people they just have no Public relations, you know, it's tragic. Yeah, I just can't refer to the ownership But I can criticize the team if I was yeah, but you know some this is what I was talking you about Yes today this is what's bothersome about for example the same those Cardinals who are going on a station And they're buying 50% of that radio station so everybody's gonna be mussel right I remember Chris Moron said that I was never gonna be on this station because you know I always rip away and I'll never be on QAamina here We are almost eight years later. It's Chris Moron and where the hell is he by the way? Chris Moron Yeah, I don't think he's with the SPN anymore. I don't know how to happen to him Maybe he's at some small station like Poccipsy or similar like there maybe in Trenton I know good W.V. D. and Trenton maybe he's working there doing like little league hockey games. I have no idea Yeah, but he he was so sure that I'd never be on here because I ripped it away now Of course if Joyce and Caroline would have had their way we wouldn't be able to say anything about the teams about the franchise owners about Management about anybody remember that routine. We had to go show contrasting try to get well everybody's been assigned this well Guess what joy You honey nobody signed it you idiot. I mean that that's what the audience wants to hear they want to hear people You know, it's they was under mine. You know what you know what the class he's sucking you know what the classic line was that the little fella said about me was that I guess he was asked why he has a problem with me Said well, I don't listen to them. That's the classic right? I don't listen to them Uh-huh good morning David he knows you're awful, but he doesn't listen to yeah He doesn't listen well. You have problems with guys named David you got the Mohard They don't don't don't don't you know it's Samson. So I guess you just got a David kind of a guy You know what? Gagers have to height up both of them Although David Johnson he's a friend of ours. There's one oh day that David's great. Yeah Yep, and Logan David you probably have a little bit of that but other than that you just not a yeah Here's a galith and they're they can be the David or Kim Bocampers a galith just step on him Kim govada and step on his ass What I want to slimey thing to do you know, well, you don't have to overpay them lucky to Hank in managed because I'm not gonna go after Bocampers You go ahead and load ball them, you know That's like it has some legal ram ram for patients to me. You know what it sounds like when they say things like you know We're out the you know do whatever we can you know what it sounds like total paranoia about us Well of course, and that's what it may they thought because in the fact that you know they got a lot of money behind them They were gonna just put it on the air. They're gonna put a bunch of losers like Stu gods and the Danle of Bastard on here And they're gonna kill us and they got that dolphins, you know Well anybody can get the dolphins for four and a half million a year who'd help want to lose that kind of money And especially it's seen that for the seconds consecutive home game had to go to the line down to the wire to So I you know to get the a black the Black out lifted two times in a row against Carolina no less against a good team Well, maybe they would thought they were gonna have some exclusive broadcast You know, well, you know, it's up had a good idea said that the maybe next time they have one of those deals QAM We'll buy up the remaining tickets and what we'll do is so that makes a lot of sense stuff We wouldn't pay for the rights, but we'll pay not to have a lot. Now listen to this a good idea It's a never from a channel for be sure to watch the game on channel for this week And just to make sure that's televised and then nobody listens to Jimmy Siffles, you know You don't have to do that Neil There's no TV or you can go to any bar and watch the games. Oh, yeah, I can see them all I got the package. Well, I've got the best name sports package. I could all the NCAA football and basketball I got NASCAR and I thought I would watch it. I got the NFL packing hockey packets You know, we bet every baseball game that's being played every day. I mean, how can you beat that? Did you see the commercial for hockey this running right now about Terrific it's you think you're running watching a preview for one of those remember those horror movies Nellem Street, you know, try to the 13th right well They they're running a commercial now where this young attractive girl is in the kitchen and she's doing stuff And you see the shadow appear outside the kitchen and then they zoom in on the shadow and it's a guy in a hockey mask And you know the same one from Friday the 13th and it says hockey's back I'll be damned. I think that's great. That is cute. Well, you want to get hockey intensive here. I took that polio today Okay, but he drove on least one again lives that people not for y'all five four exhibition four three whatever it was But nobody cares don't talk hockey don't kill me don't say that me with that hockey talk You take it's up there. I've got your probably up tickets. Oh, I first I don't have tickets Why not my gonna go slip over there? It's a very uncomfortable arena what I can sit right here I'll watch them in the comfort of my living room on TV. I have a lot of machines at the arena No, I might go over for that.

The people implored to deserve whatever they get they're just idiotic pathetic Maybe they might be better to get in battered again when you're in and wind and the it's horrible Then do you see the thing with his bus that blew up with the old people with the oxygen Uh, that whole bunch of people would you know small tanks the oxygen on there and I bet only that's what ignited and blew the bus up 20 people dead In Houston it's horrible.

They said to bus local nursing home in the Houston suburb of Belair yet yesterday headed for facilities in the Dallas for worth area see these people i guess thought they were going to be safe the name well surprise interstate forty five stretches more than 250 miles from Calvast and through the Dallas so you see the head that this enormous amount of road to cover in terms of you know putting the cones down and etc but nevertheless they started way too late as usual for a forecast to say read it remains an extremely early morning and the forecast to be ready to go to the right more than expected to be a major Houston in Dallas to be directed but they're going to get and what it's going to do is to know what makes landfall stall and they say it's going to rain and rain and rain for days is what they were saying before so tornadoes and big stormsters and refuelves are forecast in the world is getting heavy duty rains right now and when wind and so we're going to do a lot of things.

Here's our poll results yesterday before we get to very jackass and I will read that I might spend a whole four hours on this today except the 11 30 the trends come up and don't agree with me we had a conversation with her before the show this morning and this stuff agrees that it's not important that we do all I will but that the other guy oh fail. Oh and of course the other guys and nothing to do with us so I guess we're safe right? Because we go to a sports show you know the other 20 hours we're doing the on sports crab. Thank you Lord. But it's important that the other sports station continues feeling badly because you'll find where gets upset like that. And of course the fact that again a couple of Wired Diaries back one month in April in 18 to 34 whatever it was. Oh that's going to be our demographic and the other place that all is old Jews on here like that setup call we had the one day about how they had to pass through this so much hippo and younger than the mad dog.

I'll say the Beatles. The Stoom's, dude. There you go. How about the searchers? Anyway, oh this is, I got a great article here, which I might even actually read one today. We got the trends coming to 1130, which lately we don't pay much attention to the trends, but I'll make an exception today. Let's milk it. This is global warming says environmental chief. This is from the independent UK as Hurricane Rita Threaton's devastation scientist blames the climate. And I notice on the TV newscast and George noticed it too. More and more now they're just letting slip in. Not like heavy duty, but they're letting slip in occasionally. What's this to? Global warming and they warmer than normal temperatures in the Gulf. And that's why these hurricanes every, when they hit those warmer waters are becoming monster hurricanes as opposed to the usual more pedestrian hurricanes that were like a pain in the ass, but didn't like kill a whole bunch of people. But of course, immediately they got to have the other size. Oh, you know, I'll bring on the bunny and this scientist on it. This is just an old power weather pattern and the audio audio audio and the most never stole a freight train. Anyway, who is the best American rock band of all time? Or what is? Or what was?

And we're finally in the news script. 1045 and 560WQMe know who we left off and I can't believe it all. Somebody might say, oh, they're not a rock band. Well, of course they are. Okay. Yeah. And their other. Chicago was on there. Isn't it? It was on the original one. Right. I thought we lost them off. That would be really bad. Maybe I just didn't read it. Maybe it was my band. But look who's leading so far. I can't explain why I took you out that 19th song. Why? 19th songs from the Eagles just in the computer. Wow. Oh, that's great. I still voted for the doors. I'll get some doors up here. Just a little bit. And we hear it's very jackass writes in the hero this morning. Finally, after all these years, very right say provocative calm. He says, South Florida Sports Talk plays more like a soap opera. And of course, we all know that he is. It's a AM in 790's. Joe Rose is tweaking down the bastard in the station general manager John Stugot's Weener. It's 2PM and Howard David raises the idea of punching WQM talk show's Neil Rogers who was bash David for years. That's that's not our audience. It's 5PM in La Bastille and Weener. Are we turning fire on Rose? Every day is a soap opera on South Florida Sports Talk video. And listeners elected determine which insults are sick in which are serious. 790 actually we see emails from people wondering whether certain hosts genuinely dislike each other. I'll leave never had those very. But of course you have your head up there. And so naturally you know more about their emails and other about our since you have the ancestral relationship. But anyway, very goes on. In our business, everybody's material WQM's Orlando Alzacuary said, rock solid. You have to be thick skin. Most of it is thick, but some of it is personal. But in what other business do employees open the express to stain for their bosses and publicly rip colleagues? This market is unique said David who's been the brother several on air host barbs during his three and a half years of QAM. I have a hard time believing that this exists all over this country. Though David does it happens in New York too. It just appoints me. I thought it was supposed to be entertainers and communicators and not little old ladies talking over the back of the fan's David continued. Just before he said. I really believe the majority of the audience would read the discussed topics that inside stuff. Some people consider it a ten. I consider it a waste of time. He said. WQM host humanity is rarely criticized by other hosts in the market. He's a matter differently than how or David. It's funny and makes for good listening. Especially beating up on your boss man. It said, Lister is love it. Man it's existant might not have an equivalent to this. WQM finally reimbursed and for travel expenses. Every complaint about the issue on the year. WQM general man Greg Reed who reportedly will leave the station by the end of the year allows Rogers to insult him repeatedly. But seven nineties Joel findberg won't permit his host to do the same. Ah, ah, what a baby. Ben skinned. Just wait for these numbers come out Joel. If they're what I think they're going to be man. His skin is going to break. He better get some gauze and the cotton batten. I have a policy the way goes to the WQM is not allowed at my station. It's not a separable said findberg. The majority investor in the group that's leasing seven nineties signal. They're leasing it. They don't own it. They're leasing it. Post the host and they want to take shot this. He's at it. That's their business. Just not at him because he's the headhunter. He's the big cheese. He's the big mother. He's at whatever he is. Rogers was delivered several treats that management says. I take a little jab to one step bothers me. I just go with it without thinking. Oh, how about another suspension for Joel? The Rogers David situation is clearly personal. That's the literary says. What about the insulting changes between LeBastard and the Rose? 97% of it they stick and the other three percent is me and Joe Bing Babies who need pacifiers LeBastard said. Well, there seem to be a lot of babies over their had station including the general nine-year Joel findberg or they whatever his name is. The general man grew a stew got to me. In that with the article says, I'm sure Joel findberg is that, oh, I'm sorry, the majority investor. The big like I said, the head cheese. Local host take different approaches when mocked by a colleague. He's WKQM Steve Goldstein has responded anglery to Rogers comedy bits about him. No, quite the contrary very not only has any responded anglery, but he actually sang the guilty song which is why I played it in bars back years ago when we first started playing that. Remember that? Yep. He liked it. See, this is the thing. We put I put so many of these people on the map. I make them famous or otherwise they'd be generally ignored. I make them in likely celebrities. Vulcan Brian is made them in like major big life character. He's not a fan of my voice and that's well within his right school. Steve said he was doing a radio show. His job is to entertain people. He doesn't well. How do you like that? That's the old man sucking up a little bit. I told you you're going to do a hell of a job on those pants against David City took his colleague shots personally at first, but then I realized it's just a way to provoke someone. After a while I get brain damage and find myself shooting back just to be defensive and then the good side of my brain says you're jumping into the same cesspool. Woo! Hey, Mald. Can repeat a chest by colleagues. He hurts the target of those attacks. David says they can because perception becomes reality. Oh, Goldstein disagrees. See, Geli, he's on top of it. I've never gotten a job or radio shift. I have never not gotten a job or radio shift because of what Neil Rogers said. He understands it. Dominique, now here is here comes this is the part we almost ought to have a fanfare for this. This is the greatest line, the greatest baby line in the history of human race, even little babies of the battle. Absolutely, this line coming up. Dominique, you have wants to lure Rose back. Isn't that interesting? Greg, you want to lure her back after you stand in the light room and jerk them around a couple of times and then they'll put it to an idea and now he'd like to have him back. Too late. Dominique, you have wants to lure back Rose, but Rose when Joyce's dolphins, Ameless drops said, I'm happy where I am. Said fine, Bury. Now here it is. Here comes the piece to resistance. Said fine, Berg Joe is going nowhere. He has an uncomplete clause. He hates WDQAM. Dominique, you know, see, he's got that part wrong. He hates Greg Reed. He has an EQAM. He hates WQAM. Dominique, you know, is one to do anything they're hurt us. How do you like that? Dominique, you know, is one to do anything they hurt us. He's just gonna find Bury. That's just gotta be the most hysterical. Yeah, poor baby. You gotta try to hire the helper that tried to hire mad dog. The mobile can't go after after you played little games with him and we're gonna her. Well, me and where the main guys, okay, where the bad guys, okay Joe, you could be the whistens over there with the bad guys. Meanwhile says Bury. David's future remains uncertain. His contract inspires in March. And then there's some breath of the one said being loser, which we know, but nice going very very jackass. Let's hear it, audience. Let's hear it, Warlord. We're very jackass who finally redeems himself with a sensational article. This is the kind of people, this is the kind of crap that people stink their teeth into. As opposed to, well, let's talk about abortion and let's talk about all this other boring garbage that some people out of my mentioned Tommy's name think that talk radio is still all about. Look at this. butter, that's a number of this has been out there. But he also 40 mile hour disgusting New Orleans in the 90s for the family living his mother. On a rate because of all of this, he certainly is in the area. He is going to be going to be hard for the end of the war. I'm sure. Oh, well. By members of the 82nd airborne there and you will be serving the situation from there over the next hours, Darren. Look at that. Looks like New Orleans is down off for the same stuff all over again. Bad. What is this thing? California girl expelled from Christian school because her parents are lesbian for this come from. Somebody sent us in. Uh, Dutthead at it to me. Uh, hey, Dutthead. You're fair. Ontario, California not to be confused with Ontario, Canada. Ontario, California, 14 year old student was expelled from a Christian school because her parents are lesbian. The school superintendent said in the letter. Les beans. Oh my God. Shea Clark was expelled from Ontario, Christian school yesterday. Your family does not meet the policies of admissions superintendent Leonard's job wrote to Tina Clark. The girls biological mother. Stop wrote that school policy requires at least one parent may not engage in practices immoral or inconsistent with a positive Christian lifestyle such as cohabiting without marriage or in a homosexual relationship the LA Times reports today. Stop can be reached for comment by the newspaper. Shea and her parents said they won't fight the ruling. School administrators learned the parents relationship this week after she was recommended for talking to the crowd during a football game. Tina Clark said Clark and her partner been together 22 years have two other daughters ages nine and 19. Uh, how about that? You can't see an Christian school because your parents are a couple of bullbikes. How do you like that? Stay back and you're piping to puff on it. Why would they want to send her to that kind of a school anyway? Oh, who knows because they're crazy? I guess. Why would anybody want to be involved with any of these religions anyway? They got to be crazy. I got to be nuts. 458 hosts in the first hour. We got to shot at the 500. I'm not getting into that thing about, you know, don't you agree Josh? We've already proven our point. We got a massive vivid gigantic audience out there. The poll results are so they're simulating. That's right. We only pull the counts is that they am arbitron crap, but we don't care about that because it's a summer book going to be finishing off anyway. We got two thirds of the summer book and that trend coming 11 30 this morning. And I'll tell you one thing. Some states nine, no, I don't want to mention no colleges or frequency better have more than a point. This time, we're going to be in real deep due to. They better start looking in the mirror over there with the crafter put on the other than Joe. The garbage they're putting on here expecting people to listen to and then London stands. It's got nothing to do with two M hurting them. It has to do with the fact that they suck. You see, that's a different stool. Just like Mo talking about, oh yeah, well, perception becomes reality. You're the one that created this image by coming in like a windbag speaking of bags and quit a sleasing bag by the way, it stinks. Yeah, people of the fan probably when they get up up a stream from that man. Woo, look out. Anyway, we got about almost 500 votes on the poll. The best American rock band of all time.

But you sure flew quick when it came to sit. Terry Shalom. Son of all the bullshit of putting your tuition now saved by you. That's a logic while people grow. You played around every election golfer. He was a bank casher. I already used a record book. He's a damn dope. And no one can't do even prepare for the worst scenario. You were the world as he had him for him. That's no good. He all in best to gauge at a later date. That's real bullshit. So I'll think you're such a way. The ones that touch you get locked up so it don't continue. But no one will get blamed like with agent playing. No hands will roll apart. And as for this, the slap on the wrist and no charges filed. What a surprise. Because you're a liar. No one gets fired with each new mess. Oh, nobody. A new death toll. A slip in the poles. That's no problem. No fix it. Your spin machine will deal with new will leaves. Because that's their job.

I kept the ray on the doubt and let the wrong ones in Haven't seen you the mercy of the same in all my sins I'm going to put it on there when the first facts came in we've got five cents I'm going to be safe Anyway suicide bomber detonated explosives inside of bus and not a good day for bus people I guess today killing two people in 2017 later today in the Iraqi capital Gunman shot dead two in Germanist officials and a brother of one of them in their cars This continued 24 hours of violence in which two US soldiers and two insurgents died So we're just continues and of course so you're not seen too much about this on the news because naturally it has nothing to do with hurricane We have other buses to a bigger fish to fry another buses to set on fire things like that six stuff on his governor paria Texas Or other patients he got his 10 gallon head on. Oh, he's that means he's real down the serious business. I guess this is global warming system environmental chief has hurricane read a threatened devastation scientist blames climate This is from the independent UK blames climate change Super powerful hurricanes now hitting the US are these smoking gun of global warming what are Britain's leading scientists believes the growing violence of storm searches Katrina which wrecked New Orleans and read an authority in Texas It's very probably caused by climate change since he's John Lotton chairman. I'm sure no relation to Charles Lotton chairman of the world commission on environmental pollution Hurricanes were getting more intense justice computer models predictably would because of the rising temperature of the sea He said the increased intensity of these kinds of extreme storms is very likely to be due to global warming In a series of unskoken comments a thinly veiled attack on the Bush administration Surgeon hit out at neocons in the US who still deny the reality of climate change Referred to the arrival of hurricane reader. He said if this makes the climate loonies in the states release Realize we've got a problem some good will come out of a truly awful situation as he spoke more than a million people were fleeing north of our way from the coast of Texas as read a One of the most intense storms on record were to the Gulf of Mexico and it'll probably make landfall And well they're saying I'd ten o'clock from our morning There are real fears that Houston could suffer as badly from read as the world in suffered from Katrina less than a month ago And as we're conclusion the Bush administration should draw from two hurricanes as such high intensity hitting the US in quicksive section so John said If what looks like is going to be a horrible mass cause of the extreme skeptics about climate change in the US to reconsider opinion That would be an extremely valuable outcome asked about characterizing them as loonies. He said there are a group of people in various parts of the world who simply don't want to We're sent human activities can change climate and are changing the climate. I'd like to know the people deny that smoking causes lung cancer I call the flat the a flat or a proud sur john not that he cares with his comments John becomes a third or leaders of Britain scientific establishment to attack the US over the Bush government's determination to cast out ungrubble warming is a real phenomenon Sir John's comments call when support recent research much of it from America itself showing that hurricanes are getting more violent Suggesting climate changes the cause of paper by US researchers last week in the US Journal of Science showed that Storms of the intensity of Katrina become almost twice as common in the past 35 years Although the overall frequency of federal firms were wild as a main broadly level since 1970 the number of extreme category for in five months As sharply risen in the 70s there was an average of about 10 category for in five hurricanes year But since 90 they've nearly doubled the average of about 18 year during the same period C-service temperatures among the key drivers of hurricane intensity have increased by an average of .5 degrees Celsius That's nine tenths of a degree Fahrenheit. Sir john said increasingly looks like a smoking gun It's a fair conclusion to draw that global warming caused to a substantial extent by people is driving increased C-service temperatures Increasing the violence of hurricanes. I've been mentioned of course the fact that the whole ice capture of anaging and that's pretty similar all going to drown But nevertheless will be dead soon anyway. Thank the Lord. County. Yeah.

Right like that person and about six minutes it's gonna be 1130 Which means those trends those arbitrends those radio ratings will come puke in across that Thanks machine which is too soon to the summer rating book, and of course that's not on not on my watch not on my Sacoat a you were there the big uneasy rights Paul Krugman if I got time to read this how long this one was long No, not bad although her came Katrina drowned much of New Orleans the damage to America's economic infrastructure Actually fell short of early predictions of course read it may make up for that But Katrina the reward and physical damage it was a blow to our self image as a nation Maybe people will quickly forget the horrible scenes from the super dome and the frustration of wondering why no help at arrived was cable TV returns to nonstop coverage of missing white women But my guess is that Katrina shocked to our sense of ourselves will persist for years America's current state of mind reminds me of the demoralized mood of the late 1979 when a Confluence of events double digit inflation gas lines in the Iranian hostage crisis led to an actual crisis of confidence Start with economic confidence. See available measures say that consumer confidence which all already was declining We fork between a hit has now fallen off a cliff one well respected survey from the University of Michigan Says that consumer settlement is at its lowest level since George birthday elder was president and America One last wrong was a national best seller. It's true that gasoline prices have received it from their post Katrina peace But even if we despair the refineries a full recovery of economic confidence seems unlikely for one thing It looks as if we're in for a long cold winter natural gas and fuel or all are still near their price peaks And most families were already struck me even before Katrina a few weeks ago they since appear reported that in 2004 while Washington A while spirit were handing a bush boom poverty increase and median family income failed to keep up with inflation It's safe to assume that most families did even worst this year Then there's the war in Iraq which is rapidly becoming impossible to spend positively the purple fingers have become I have come and gone and there no more corners to turn as it resolved views that people like Howard Dean were once derided for becoming the majority of opinion most American say the war was a mistake a majority say the administration deliberately missed out the country And to war almost four in ten say Iraq will turn into another Vietnam And many people are outraged by the cost of the war the general public doesn't closely follow economist arguments about the risk of budget deficits Or try to decide between competing Budget projections but people do know there's a big deficit that politicians keep calling for cuts and spending and that we building after Contrary to cost a lot of money they resent the idea that large sums of being spent in a faraway country where we're waiting the war whose purpose seems Increasingly obscure finally fragmentary evidence like a sharp drop in the fraction of Americans who approve of president Bush's performance in handling terrorists And in the favor of large crowds to show up for the pentagon's America supports you march and country music concert So just at the confluence of Katrina and the fourth anniversary of nine eleven of cost something to snap and public perceptions about the so-called war on terror In the early months after nine eleven America self confidence actually seemed to have been bolstered by the attack the Taliban We're quickly overthrown in present Bush-elect and look like an effective leader the positive perception of what happened after nine Eleven has needless to say that a means they have missed a bushes political stature But now that more time is election 9 11 that the whole so then they whole stretch from Pearl Harbor to VGA day people are losing faith Oh some it turns out to both run and hide It's obvious from the evening news that al-Qaeda and violent Islamic extremism in general are flourishing and the half-less response to Katrina Which should have an easy to deal with an terrorist attack and show them their leaders have done virtually nothing to make us safer And here's the important point these blows to our national self image are mutually reinforcing the sense that we're cut in unwindable war Reenforces the sense that the economy is getting worse and vice versa So we're having a crisis of confidence. It's the kind of crisis that opens at or for dramatic political changes Possibly bananas a ceremony in a good direction But we'll provide leadership now that Mr. Bush is damaged goods I'll follow up to you Swing your partner round and round now build a swimming to the world We're standing to the left to the right here. We go send a little months out. Don't see no Oh Katrina Biden those people please the person will be easy and up and it is for her right I'm tired of the hands Bush ignored the city of New Orleans Yes, some of the people down there say he failed Abu Dhabri Stop the people in the astrazon like ghetto I'll have for national garden in Ira He's funding for there.

In fact, more and more, we're like, got a Zidian reads on that. Anyway, if you missed Barry's column, and I read it at the beginning of the show, I don't want to read the whole thing. Again, because that would be a really bad. But it's got, you know, it's about sports talk radio and software is more like a so popular in this one. It hates that one and Mo and Neil and Mad Dog and Hank and the John Stubot, so we knew when Joe Rose and Dan will have mastered and all these other people. Which I want to be honest with you, you hear about how a lot of ink to people with no numbers. But that's okay to the same thing for the fan, 1980 on the dial back when they were on here on the front page. No, I said, I hear anything to get to us, you know? I think they'll do anything to hurt us. I think you're right. The Harold. And so, you know, it's a year and a year and a year and give in the take and whatever and whatever goes around comes around. And so they're going to hurt us and we hit him back and we hit him right where it hurts in a pocket to their, Tony Balloni radio partner, they're 790 and Tony Balloni is the word. Friends came out today, by the way, we went back up a little bit here, we did okay. And that other place, 790. Oh, great. On the toilet. I mean, they couldn't break a two-sharp. They're like, you held a gun to their head. But anyway, Joel Feinberg, the big hot shot of whatever he missed your eager to see. Well, it's supposed to rip him like a Roger's Rift Square, Gweed. Anyway, he's got a great line here after what said, QM would like to lure Joe Rose back, but he's a happy where he is. Feinberg says, Joe is going nowhere. He has an on-compete clause. He hates WQAM. QM is willing to do anything to hurt us as Joel Feinberg. Let me repeat it again because I know it's staggering that an adult that a, an alleged adult would lot of money would say, WQAM is willing to do anything to hurt us. I have one response to that Joel. Yeah. That's my response. Or maybe just two simple words. Okay, you know what they are? Well, I do. I don't even play. Grow up. Bye, bye, bye.
