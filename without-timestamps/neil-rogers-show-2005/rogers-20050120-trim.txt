The most disgusting program I urge everyone to complain to this station. Waha! When Bill Riley, Dylin, Shory is in square and pan. Until you if you like your job, Then you give him a laugh dance. And if you tell the old Riley, You're not looking to be just. His new, the panstride of your bird And call you an extension. Her chaloon, all the backers fare in balance. But not when he calls and dies. Peace is looking for a lassi Who likes to live with her, Who's a Riley? The Fraccomt! Go and Bill, all right, On each Shory, The Nose, And the Dorns, So when Bill Riley's dilinth, You best not pick up your phone. I wonder if these are the same kind of ceremonies The head of the Hitler came back and all, Orifice you think? Well, they had better marches, I think. Oh, is that what it was? They had better. I'm convinced the head of the men's frozen head thing. I just came up with an idea. I think I might be absolutely correct. And that is that hair mongering. You remember the enormous road trouse? Yeah, that was great. That was great. I don't think they ever killed him. I think they froze his body and he came back and he's down at Rumswell. Because every time I see him, I think that's hair mongering, Junior, Magnumistic Abana. Well, they made all those movies. They keep making it. They made it back in 83D, Roll the arrows and your hands would saw them And meet and greet and eat and stuff like that. Anyway, it's an operation day. Just in case you were paying any attention. It's enough to make me want to get. I'm saying, you're way to meet you are sucking up. There ought to be a log in this. I bet you're Joyce if you found out the meeting was sucking like this. She'd probably like, um, Take it right to the FCC immediately. When you think of a special panel of investigators. My god, what a suck up. All 247. Just licky, licky, licky. It's nauseating. And the president went to church for the first lady this morning. And he had a wonderful bowel movement. And then we had a, oh, geez. Get out of here. I noticed we're running condomspots there at the ass and the hang show. Do you hear that? No, no, I don't hear the spot. No, we had a Trojan spot. Look at the log there. Did you hear Josh? I didn't. You didn't? No. We don't have their log. I'm not talking about what you had there a log. I'm just saying in other words, you weren't paying any attention. Those are commercial evidence. Can we go over? Great filters working. Go ahead. Trojan spot for condoms. I wonder what Joyce would think about that. What do you think about that, honey? We can't say the word, you know, what goes into the condom. But wow, just wink wink. No, just don't stuff like that, right? We can judge what a bunch of hypocrites. Anyway, I'm just getting really bitter about this. I'll be glad when this day is over. The coronation of, uh, El Presidente of, uh, the Emperor Bush. High Bush. Everybody go step now. Line up. High Bush. High Bush. Come on. You can do it. I like a bullet. This time, I think you were going to save it and market in the part of the passing of our democracy. Yeah. It's not, you know, passing away of our democracy. You've got it sweetheart. Who's that then? But looking David from the gut under again. What a, it's just unbelievable. You can just kiss the media goodbye, maybe it's a, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, It would then rather signs off the last time and more. It'll be the end. I don't think we're going to have Katie Kurick. I think we'll probably have like, um, one of, one of those losers from Foxleby. I'm maybe Sean Hannity of Eden that that Lee moves on CBS. What do you think? Yeah. And then I'll have Alan Colm sitting in a background like with his mouth taped and like, tied up, you know, in the back of the studio. And occasionally we'll like pan over to him to come, Ooh, I feel like try to say something and that'll be it. Anyway, I don't go up. Be, be, be in the middle now. He's still a fur and square again. That's right. Okay. Yesterday we asked who are, what is the most disappointing flash in the pan? But tomorrow's going to be a big day at one o'clock. You know what? I can't wait. So it's ratings the fall rating book is that a one. We got a win win situation because if the ratings are great, we can say, hey, look at this. We're great. So we can say, oh, don't worry about that because nobody's on the same type. He would accept a mad dog and he don't want to be on there anyway at this point. I was asking him off Lizzy this morning about that mad dog situation. And he said, but we're a little bit like that. I shouldn't have too much to say this morning, muff. Who are what is the most disappointing flash in the pan of all time we access today? 14.5. John Kerry, 190 votes. Very weak campaign, John. He was against the war, but he was for it. And then he was for the resolution, but then he was against it. And he was, you know, now that we're there, what do we do now? Very weak, John. Very, very weak. In relation to two to one by a landslide, with the economy teetering and totering with this unbelievable record deficit. Spending money like it's coming out of a faucet tax cuts for the rich that they just can't get enough of. Now almost 1,400 dead kids over there in Iraq for no reason at all. Based on lies, based on absolute total lies. Instead of a lie, we should have had impeachment going on. Right? And the Democrats once again showed just how inept and impotent they really are. Don't worry about getting any of them, Trojan Khanems for the Democrats because they're never going to get it up anyway. John Kerry, 190. Howard Dean, 178. Now I see how to, he'll be back. Just like, ah, he'll be back. You think? Yeah. He's to get enough side to eat it. No, I'm convinced he will be back. He's got fire. He's got, uh, hose. How to say media, that's corny and bush the tooth today. Got hoisted by the same media. Oh look at this, he's a crazy person. Just like that one, Colour, we have you. Yes, they who just doesn't get it. They took it out of context. It was a directional mic, which most of you know nothing about. But he ever been in a music or in a radio business or anything connected with microphones. It was a directional mic. So it only picked up what was immediately in front of it. Not the crowd noise that he was trying to shout over. That's why he was screaming like a story. And so they took it out of context. And that a week later, they all apologized. Oh, really? He was trying to shout over the crowd. And then they played the audio and he heard the crowd is just screaming. Yeah, and it's a totally different sound. Not like that. He's like, are we really? Yeah. So, what's the point? You know what's the use? That's the media for you. They totally sold out. You too Bob, Franken, you loser. You idiot, you supplicant. You silly person you. Being given by the idiot. Yeah, get out of here. Give this. Anyway, Howard Dean was second 170. The most disappointing flash in a pan. Howard Stern on QAM. How many messed up that last? It's not a good man. 19 votes for that. That was well thought out. The WMVs in Iraq and Scott for Worldtive 75 of peace. Talk about a loose cannon. I think there's a connection there, don't you see it? I see it. Oh, they're totally released. Scott for World. We know it's tangible and exist as opposed to the Iraq WMVs. Think about that. The XFL had 50. Phil Henry 44. Are you sure? Had a pretty good show in there? Brian Bosworth and Ross P. R. R. Tyre 41. Same person, different years. Harold minor 34. Vanilla I. 33. Cecil Collins 32. We just want to get a peek. He's going up there to take a look. Look around. Somebody comes in your window tonight. And they're like, just chill out. Okay, they're just looking around. This is going to take a peek. Jimmy Johnson, we got a shot, Jimmy. We're going to do it. But he really, he stuck it at the brainstem, didn't he? Yes. Jimmy, nobody will ever forgive you. Nobody will ever forgive that unconscionable sabotage. Underbinding the brainstem, talking about how much talent was on a team. How they should have been like in a super bowl in Yadi, Adi Adi. And how you were doing is undermining the brainstem. Which wasn't a bad idea. But then you go in there and like think to join out and fall flat on your push. Jimmy Johnson, New Coke, Segway, or the Segway. Everybody in the hoods got one. And you guys play. Each of them has 29. Ashley Simpson 26, time with the Catholic Church molestation cases. Mark the bird figure out, the rich and Quentin Tarotino. They'll have 26. Four to Panthers in Alien Gonzalez 24. I see some similarity there too. You want to know why? Why? Because I think very soon, they'll both be a part of our past and sound. We'll get over here. Why did you say that? I was on a guilty. I was on a guilty. I was on a guilty. That's his bread and butter. Maybe that's his career. I was thinking about alienation. He could be one of the great broadcasters in history. The guilty, my friend. He could be one of those classic memorable people we've been talking about last couple of days. But no, because the Panthers aren't playing. I got a little story on that later on. But I got a pile of stuff here, man. All the way to the ceiling. Although we will take some important calls like this one. WCQAM, hello. How you doing Neil? Pretty good, pal. I got a question. Actually, something to say. I was watching. As much as I want a light carry and I voted for him and he donated money that I probably didn't hack out that in just a change. I wanted to talk. Would you like to hear that money back now? I don't think he got your money's worth, man. I know I did. We can't pay him. I'm watching him on TV yesterday and he's earned his rights confirmation hearing. He says, you know, I haven't decided whether you're going to get my vote yet. And I will follow up my chair. How in the hell is that you're not in that line? It sounds like a waffle to me. I don't have absolutely. And you know as much as I like, Bob Graham, I bought his book and intelligence matters. And I'm looking for this thing and he keeps popping it so much, so highly of Porter God. You have got to be kidding me. Oh my god, you had to be kidding me. I could not believe it. This is a guy who said that just months before he was named director of the CIA. He said that he wasn't qualified to even serve on the CIA or to be involved in it. And then they may come to the CIA director. Absolutely. Correct. And I want to give you a heads up. I don't know if you had a chance to watch this at the state last night, but they've got a great one coming up next week on the United States divided. Okay. So it heads up. You might want to take a look at it so you can get some of those cuts by your sight. Nice a lot of power. Now don't jump when you get to Niagara Falls. Just keep on coming. Absolutely. See you. Right. Yeah, when you're all come up to Canada and you get to Niagara Falls, if that's the way you're coming. Just don't jump. I thought about that guy, the doctor who was lost his Indians gambling in Niagara Falls, to see him. Right. He decided to convince to assign to a judge in the falls and then he got like one leg in there. And he changed his mind. So I didn't tell you about this. It was a great picture. So he jambed his foot up against the rock while he waited for help to come and bail him out. And he said, here's this doctor like standing there in the middle of Niagara Falls, jamming it, you know. Anyway, Kurt Warner had 23 most disappointing flash in a pan. I don't think that was disappointing at all. I think a board again for a vision like him. It was delightful to see that he turned out to be a big elf floppel after that one season. You know, maybe the Lord kind of turned his back on him. Maybe the Lord gives you one super bowl. Unless you just, you know, a great athlete like Tom Brady and they give you three. But if you just want to go as pious and no talent losers like Kurt Warner, Cathy Willows 22 haven't seen her speckled face lately. Ashley Banfield, her be spectacle post we haven't seen the long time twenty. And after we miss her, she was another lightweight. Oh, this candy college, she ain't no lightweight. Big celebration. Yeah. Who'd be in a blow face 17? Billy Vanilles 16. Ricky Martin, she had 14. What a screamer. Brian Greasey, busted on this George Lucas 13. That's a good poll question. Can I spend my time with Ricky Martin or Jeff Garcia? Aaron Summers had 12 Denise Rodman head 11. Captain Kendall had 10. See there you are Captain Kendall had 10. You were like making sport of that. Who? Captain Kendall. That's remember the guy that called in about the yesterday and we said, What? Well, 10 people who in what? Who? I don't have any idea. Captain Freakin Kendall. The silver dollar had seven, which I don't know why was on her. Bernie Kerrick, Keto Kailin, twin peek six. So we got that OJ story about his daughter. A Kairwin K and John Rocker reach head four. Tiny Tim, a tracks to best be boys. Jerry Reffordy had three apiece. I guess the best be boys don't have any a tracks. Brad Johnson, John Bobbitt and Drew Michaels two apiece. No. Yes. And what apiece for David Justice, the WHA, Base City Rollers and I need to be an instinct and have any. Why is that? Why is that? Maybe they were just looking at that picture with just in ticker bill. Ian can at the thing. That's the rest thing. You have to specify to reduce my get up. 10 13 and 5 16 WKM is going to be a fine Thursday. We're just killing time for those ratings come out. So we're going to talk tomorrow. Let's not lie. Okay. We're just Biden our time or Joe Biden. Here's another one for you. Like I said the other day. You know, he's grilling condolese and he's got all these reservations. And he keeps saying, I'm going to vote for you because the president's got to write to pick whatever but to losers and not see as you want. But I'm going to, yeah, what is that? What is that? Part again of that spinalist democratic party that we know in the fear so badly. That's what Roosevelt said. The only thing we have to fear is my own party. Remember that? Right. Even Leslie Gorset is my party and I'm embarrassed for it. Getought. Yeah, all right. You're like a fool but like a love. Like a lime on the Fit back of an eye like a lime. You're so Hurry Check Show by the honor and fear. Tell 500 real front there where we like long. Mm. Whoa, cool man. Well, good night sweep analyses. Just now for explore close shows Talk about cats like the inside Folia we might be blown And I'd go to the mountains We were sitting around But you're way down We stand there now Much in and out Call me crazy, look at the boothing I'm in a calm and crazy But it was to me like her melody Disseezer That's the same picture we had either What? I was just talking to Eric about it this morning I thought it was a done deal We're doing the brothers right? Are you sure you were talking to Eric? Maybe we were talking to him Because a lot of people think they got to Done deal when he talked to him And then uh oh Uh oh Yeah, I can relate to that Oh, it's a done deal Not Well, don't get me started Oh brother, you said the wrong word done deal That's a bad expression at QAM Sorry, just like we talked to Mad Dog had a done deal I thought I had a done deal back and all And I thought I had a done deal back In about December 22 You had a done deal Yeah done deal Why did I resound with these bastards? I must be a crazy person I don't I'm starting to think even though he didn't like me too much I have a lot in calm that would jump Henry I must be crazy I must be not Yeah, I'm starting to think that's me What in the world did I do this for? But anyway The money keeps showing up So what are we going to do with that And these people as much as they look from I'll just get to the right Fantastic, patriotic They want to see some new shots Man, you want to see some new angles They want to see some new things They want to see you know I'll just have the winners of the poll that we took Are we?

It's from the day Did you save that poll the top five? Eric saved it Yeah, he switched it for I could print it But he's got it Okay And when we got to new poll If they're already uploaded for sugar It's not even a contest I'm thinking it's 10, 20 in a morning I'm already thinking about ice cream Stop No, I've been saying I'm eating it I'm thinking about it I'm thinking about what kind of ice cream I'm going to buy it to minion after the show today Well, you're dying for thinking about it Well, I just like yesterday when we started Remembrance and I'm not doing that poll today We'll do that again To turn back the clock and arrest runs Staying the one you missed the most That was a good idea But we did a similar one not that long ago Like months ago But we like to pretend that we don't want to We want to vary them, you know Mix it up Shombie likely headed to TV How somebody called about this The other day had no idea what they were talking about Because I guess I'm a day behind on a couple of these things The OJs Sydney story Sydney Simpson You know the Simpson Fuhame Very Jackass says Miami radio announcer Boog Shombie likely will become the new TV playback play voice And the Florida Marlins A ride A baseball source said Tuesday Shombie and Marlins ride Holder fox to sports whatever it is Still must come to terms on the contract You go boy We love Boog And maybe someday and you know 10, 15, 20 years We'll say boy Boog Shombie He's going to be one of those legendary broadcasts He's literally nobody knows And he's got a distinctive style He's got orange hair And he was beloved You know what I mean?

Okay. There you go. There's one for you anyway Boy, I'm telling that Spun Bob Square pants. He's getting almost as dangerous as the teletobe. Thank you, winky You know we still say tiki winky. Thank you We kept us here together. Somebody says add booze to your pool. That's said that we added on there. We did booze Okay, I'm going to be the poem the second but first is for his OJ and at the ill be hit his concern I'm sure he's got a lot of excuses. You know our fathers a double murderer Lot of violence in the family. She's been exposed to a lot of bugger test stuff right right so let her off the hook touch He's hot. Yeah, OJ Simpson's 19 year old daughter was busted and float after she refused to stop cursing at cops Probably reports of a fight after a varsity basketball game I mean police said Sydney Simpson was arrested outside High School gym center named charge with the sorely conduct also with resisting arrest without violence Relatively stopping a cop in the right hand as he tried to take her into custody police said Two teenage girls told cops of the scene that Simpson hit them in the face but they decline at press charges Police said Simpson family lawyer Yale Yentagalander said yesterday that the spute was a cat fight at Sydney And we solved it by the time police got there. It's just a cat fight the lawyer didn't say what started the scutty suggested was the cops who made a situation worse Well, that never happens isn't no but if you're the police we're told that nobody wants to press charges Sydney is arrested for disorderly conduct. Well, I'd have said it doesn't take a legal genius or a great legal mind to figure out that the event was over And that it was the police who caused the charge to be had the dust up began or the dust up Visiting the or post it's not even a British paper, but it says the dust up is not a brick thing yet is that is so the dust up The Brits are such a bunch of silly Nazis man. In fact, I think we ought to begin along a wonder or Tony Blair's involved in this coalition of the unwilling You know one good Nazi always works well with the other wait a minute. Let's see Greg weed and Andy cord your both bitter fruit from the same drug Dung covered tree WKT's going alright. We talked to anywhere 31 the staff had to find out today from listeners who read the press release two days ago Where's cords not a frustration? Probably sniffing run a wolf's panties resolve job back. Oh Andy cord. He's the scourge of South Florida. Tim and Greg weed, but anyway getting back to the story about Sydney Simpson But dust up began after boys basketball game at ransom ever leads school and coven to grove against gover prep cops said oh me gover is a can See how British this whole thing is cluckle work Sydney who attends college in Boston graduated from gover last year Was at Saturday's game her 16 year old brother Justin is a student at gover when two cops arrived outside the gym They saw a big crowd gathered with coaches trying to keep the piece one of the officers in his report Simpson came to me screaming in yelling with cops and noted that she was asked to calm down several times and refuse Calm down OJ calm down you murdering piece of crap. The officer that interview the two teens who claims Simpson him in the face Simpson became very loud. Sorry to scream for a fan of these the other cops said his report She was asked three times to calm down. She refused to continue to scream FU the report said FU FU I made police lieutenant Bill Schwartz was spotted to go in her smart sister and said for her safety in the safety of all concern The officers decided to remove her from the situation clearly this upset her even more and she slept on the cops in a hand not a good idea Don't be slap a milk cops bitch Sydney was released after she agreed to appear in court at an unscheduled date on the misdemeanor charges Resisting arrest without violence carries a perlave up to a year in jail that a certainly conduct charge carries a possible 60 days in jail Maybe she and OJ could go in there in the new little time together when he said So if I see a choir every week is telling us about how OJ is just under virtue going in there It was hiding all of those yet all these places around the country where he allegedly was hiding all these artifacts and trophies and all of this stuff Or it's not for the Indians in dollars so they didn't have to pay the Goldman family a dime or the Browns by the course That's just a rumor because everybody who knows anything about sports just love ZoJ especially if they work at QAM We just love OJ we like murderers a lot. Don't we a lot here today's poll question Now the reason I said other than sex because if we had sex on everybody would say every guy was going to take to the sex right now Who is it right there you go other than sex what do you consider your number one addiction?

On these that are replaced from last night. It's snowing in Penn Nation. The fabulous fortune. The jocky Casey Kaufman. There you go. And anything about the inauguration today, huh? I could play boy TV on it right out of half a second. But I'm not going to even bother trying that, you know? What else would it possibly be on? How about the BBC? I wonder if they're doing that thing. It's skating down. It's involved in relief operations in the countries affected by these tsunami. More than 15,000. Oh, you asked. A lot of us are constipated Nazis, man. Who are you? People, kid. Anyway, you like this to a conservative thick of soft target, a cartoon sponge. On the heels of electoral victories, barring San Sex married, some influential conservative Christian groups are turning their attention to a new target. The cartoon character Spun Bob Squarepants. Have you heard about this story? They're at it again. Is he gay? You think that the purple tinky winky was evil? Just wait. Does anybody here know Spun's Bob, Dr. James C. Thompson, the fascist found where Focus on the family asked against who's in it. They black-tied dinner for members of Congress and political allies to celebrate the election results? Spun Bob needed no introduction. In addition to his popularity among children who watch his cartoon show is become a well-known camp figure among adult gay men. Gay. Perhaps because he holds hands with his animated sidekick Patrick and likes to watch the imaginary television show, the adventures of mermaid boy and a mermaid man and vertical boy. Now, Dr. Thompson said Spun Bob's creators had enlisted him in a pro-homosexual video in which he appeared alongside children's television colleagues like Barney and Jimmy Neutron among many others. The makers of the video, we said time to mail it to thousands of elementary schools to promote a tolerance pledge that includes tolerances for differences of sexual identity. The video is creator Neu Raju, a Nio Raju's who wrote to disco hit We Are Family. So, Mr. Dawson's objection is to promote misunderstanding. Mr. Raju said he founded We Are Family Foundation after the 9-11 attack to create a music video to teach children about multiculturalism. The video is appeared on TV never, and nothing in it or it's accompanying materials reverse the sexual identity that plays Barney from the Southern Poverty Law Center is not mentioned on the video, and is available only on the group's website. Mr. Raju suggested that Dr. Dawson and the American Family Association, the Anxious American Family Association, the conservative Christian group that first sounded to the alarm, might have been confused because of an unrelated website belonging to another group called We Are Family with SupportSk Youth. The fact that some people may be upset with each other people's lifestyle, that's okay, Mr. Raju. We're just talking about respect. Like you're referred would say, RESPE, however else I go's respect. Mark Barron, Baron this, the Foundation's lawyer said critics need medication. So, right, take some doggy down as there. James Dawson, you fascist bastard you. On Wednesday, however, Paul Bature assistant to Mr. Dawson and focus focus focus focus on the family said the group stood by accusation. We said the video as an insidious means by which the organization is manipulating and potentially brainwashing kids. He said, it's a classic bait and swish. How do I say it? SpongeBob Square Pants is flaming. Everyone knows that it's squidward escape. And he's going, we're not too happy about that. Is that purple Tiki Winky? Can we still play that? Which got away. Got away knows what he says near. What is that? We're long and Jerry Paul will hunt the right handle. When I woke up today, I put my TV on an insidious tending or CNN. I saw a purple creature with a gaze. I know this head. It wasn't upside down. Try and go purple thinking. Hey, tell the tell me. I think you can see it. I think we got it.

Then some of the people in that place had done the last how many years now. But third minute. Not that we had all that guy. How back and say, oh, you're the only one to believe. I was like, ha ha ha ha ha. Let me just say one thing about some of the steering people, not all of them with some of them. And that is that they are so paranoid and so insecure and like, you know, anybody that would dare criticize like Howard's nose or his hair or the fact that he goes on until he damn well feels like it anything. I mean, no matter what it is, the slightest thing. Oh, see, what's your problem with the hard and are you responsible for how it now? But if it makes you happy, yes, I got stern eyes. I make you feel happy. I got him off the air. I mean, grow up already. He wasn't supportive. He shouldn't have been on here in the first place of these people at a brains which they don't.

Last week, her two was in Palm Beach doing stuff. And she's doing stuff in Palm Beach and radio and whatever. And when her two were in Palm Beach, she's fine. She's still around. Well, I want to go back to here. That's great to hear that. And at least some people are doing okay. And this got it for second country of ours. In this horrible business of ours, right? Oh, well.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. And I'm thinking more like in a bathtub. I got a world pool here. Just remember somebody's going to have to haul your car to side of there. And that's okay. But I'll have a big smile on my post. Oh, boy, a whole bathtub full of score ice cream. We'd like not just regular hot food, but like hot hot food. See, let me just tell you one thing, all you kids did it. This crap they tried to pass off is hot funs today. If it isn't hot, then it's not hot funs. It's just like chocolate sauce. I think they do have this stuff that you microwave now. I know, man. Oh, like I don't know that. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm asking them, expert, man. Do I kind of swear? Are you crazy? Yeah. They do have this stuff that you like. Oh, yeah. You started to sound more like Marvin the raw man every day now. Oh, yeah. Boy, boy, what a, I can give you lessons on ice cream and the, do you even necessarily turtle before I started talking about it? No. Can I necessarily turtle yet? Probably. See, I'm not into ice cream like you are. Oh, I'm not just into ice cream. I'm obsessed, obsessed. Can they? Okay, like sugar is the thing on my addiction and I put on the list. But, you know, it depends on what form it is. So much where I certainly wouldn't have it in soda. In other words, if I ever, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I give me a regular coconut instead of a dot coke, I start gagging because it's a sodium sweet. Yeah, I, I, I, I, which I understand that because I've had to do it on the behalf of the ice cream faster than you can say, but that's good. I could. I'm not that I, I have to gallon. I would say anywhere from a point to a court, depending on how depressed I am based on the, this station. I'm going to sugrade read for ice cream. What would you call it? Ice cream, aggravation. Okay. Yeah, death by aggravation, man. That's what just like Hank was saying that they, when you dive, that if there's nothing worth in stress, stress kills keep that in mind that dim would out there. Ron, pro-Zachron, stress kills. So we're going to look at Bratys, then outside you door with a shotgun and just keep up pacing back and forth until you croak with your blood sugar about 600 pro-Zachron. I think it's about time to last who him don't you or something. He was currently using for about 10 seconds, but at this point other than stress, what you consider your number one edition, marijuana, the wacky way to gan jban 53, alcohol 51, pornography 46, cigarettes 43, junk food 43, Taco Bell. That, yeah, Taco Bell sounds pretty good. Sugar 31, I thought that would be higher. I guess it's only me. I said, it's a long the only one who believes that sugar. I don't think other people believe it, but other people have other addictions. I see. I don't have any 23 perfect people better than I thought. Well, we don't believe anyway. Television 21, sports 17, Neo Rodgers 15, obsessed caffeine 15, computer slash video games 10, although it's computer dash video games. I'm not, I don't know. Whatever. I like this slash better.

I'm not fat. You know, I can't stand people who aren't fat. Well, I do like people who aren't fat. In a different way. You know what I'm talking about. People who aren't fat who are like judge metal, just push it away. All the favorite cliches of, you know, some people who've got the right genes and probably eat more than I do. They're never getting an ounce. Just push it away. Just eat smaller portions. All this other crap. You know, like every five minutes is now on TV. They got a new diet and they got the new answers. And all this other crap. And they got these stupid ass diet tins. And they want to be there for less 20 years. Well, we've been getting fat or in fat or in fat or in diet from it. And we are plugging our arteries and they're giving us a new song. And then, and Dr. Pupta, they're on CNN. Who wouldn't know as asked from your elbow when it comes to fat? They know nothing about it. Speaking of fat, Michael Moore is bodyguard or rest on an airport gun charge. Phil Maker, Michael Moore's bodyguard was arrested for carrying an unlicensed weapon in New York's JFK airport last night. Police took Patrick Burke, who says more employers him and accusted the F.E. to credit he was carrying a firearm at a ticket counter. Burke is licensed to carry a firearm in Florida and California, but not in New York. Burke was taken to Queens, Central Booking, and could potentially be charged with a felony for the incident. Moore is 23, Yadiyadiyadiyadiyadiyadiyah, bowling for column blind criticizes what Moore calls America's culture of fear and obsession with guns. And there's a point there to be made, I guess. Of course, this is on the Fox News website. There's like a little shot there, so this vehicle shot and possibly it is. Yeah. But if you're going to have a bodyguard, you're going to have what good is it if he's not armed, right? Especially when your enemies are a bunch of gun-totelyutics. That's correct. A bunch of Bible-tuffers gun-totelyutics would mean nasty dogs, pitfalls, and whatever else. And so far, in two hours, 560560, oh, and all of the operations come out of the nine minutes, so we're going to carry that. Oh, no, we're just going to have to say, Abu-Gah. Abu-Gah. Abu-Gah. Rab 100 times. We don't want to hear the bush, my stroke. I don't want to see it. I don't want to know from it. I don't want to hear about it. What is this crap? I bet you're parting. What is this crap? You're Emily Teng on this. In other words, you rather hear the inauguration than this? Oh, okay. I don't want to be a bad person. I'm not sure we're lying, okay. I don't want to get mad. I don't want to hear the bush at it. How's that? Better? How's it? How's it? How's it? How's it? How's it? How's it? How's it? How's she doing? She's still doing? I've worked about how to make noise. She's in my mouth. Is it your fault? And there's always... How's that? All right. Okay, it's that the president's inauguration. We're going to play all this crap today. A big improvement. Oh, and by the way, just in case you forgot much of the world thing's bushes dangerous. A wide majority of people questioned an ABC world service global opinion full published believe that US president George W. Bush has made the world more dangerous and of course they are. Almost half of the nearly 21,000 people in 21 countries responded to the poll also made no distinction between the Bush administration and America itself. See, that's the problem we're getting a bad name because of the Bush mice. They saw US influence in the world as largely negative and view to Americans negatively as well. In another country's pool was their support for contributing troops to Iraq. Negative feelings about Bush are high and are generalizing to the American people who we elected them said Stephen Colt directed a program on international policy attitudes at the University of Maryland, which carried out the polling collaboration with the international polling company GlobalScan. This is quite a grim picture for the US. He said, yeah, for us as a new S. Instead of it for you, in Senate confirmation hearings Bush's nominee of Secretary of State Condolese arise two day agnows the need for more diplomacy and for the building of alliances. He said that you in the interaction with the world must be a conversation on a monologue. I think that meant to say US that it says you went. But typically one British contributed to the world service website Wednesday said Bush's reelection means more pollution, more war, more social injustice especially in America. He asked, whatever happened to the freedom loving forward thinking right minded people that made America the envy of the rest of us. Oh, how well he said that, right? Love it. On average across all countries, the BBC poll indicated that 58% of people believe Bush's reelected is made to world more dangerous only in three countries, poll and of course they've always had problems India and the Philippines was their majority of support for Bush and the Indians men they got the brains are little scrambled after a couple weeks ago. But even in traditionally US allies such as Germany, France and Britain as well as in neighboring Canada and Mexico, the Senate was predominantly anti-Bush anti-Bush in Turkey, US ally and the only Muslim ever the North Atlantic video organization 82% of those polls said Bush's re-election was negative a world peace and they are anti-Bush. Anti-Bush was also strong in Latin America with 79% of those polls in Argentina and 78% in Brazil describing his re-election in negative terms. In the poll, which took place from November 15 January 5 between 500 and 1800 people were surveyed in each country and the Saudi audience in part is in third. So the rest of the world is scared, crapless of Bush, how do you like that? They're scared of the America because they know they're on to them. They realize that in a course there's a ran business, they're rattling their spheres and our ran and starting to say, hey, you better watch it, you better watch it, you better not pout. Stuff like that, isn't that what they're saying? Sublet that. Wow. Oh and of course with those big elections coming up in just 10 days, on January 5. Intelligence sources estimate 150 car bombings and 250 suicide attacks are planned. I had to have a rack of elections at the end of this month on January. But, sir, man. A top Iraqi police official told CNN today, the information came galactoring interrogations of recently detained insurgents. We don't you love that word, the insurgents, yeah. We just made that up. Who said targets of the attacks with include elections centers and other locations of about being specific? Responded to the report, US military spokesman said, this is the trend we've been expecting to be in close to the election. A lot of people are going to die. But, you know, if you want to fight for your freedom, you got to die. Right? Right. Isn't that what it was all about? Right. So we can help these people fight for their freedom and die until we were told. Oh. Oh. The warnings came a day after four suicide car bomb attacks in and around Baghdad, called at least 25 Iraqis and the bombers. Several Islamic websites published claims of responsibility for all four bombings by the terrorist network led by Jordanian born Abu Musaab al-Zahqawi who has ties to Al-Qaeda. And bombing Tuesday, I said, well, we know that. We know all about these other bomb attacks. We know that bomb attacks in the area of the Saudi Arabia, the Indian Party of the Liberatory. They're just dying over their like flies because we're doing a fine job. And of course, if we can't even get to job that if we don't have enough troops on the ground in Iraq, how are we going to go into Iran and Libya and Syria and Egypt and North Korea and Saudi Arabia and Canada? You will Roger. Yes. Who's it like? On five six six. And. And just sitting around the house, we're not much to do. I got new rodges on the radio and. Hey, what are you going to do? It's a way of call it. 12 to one hour. We're about 10 years too late. You have that one thing's for great. One thing was President. Okay. Was innocent. But we've been still deep friends. And you've been saying, well, I've been fairly editing to net. And there was no stand yet. Never heard about being laughing. Was there without any luck? We felt here about my time. And none of that thing gets past. And all that frequently say, yeah, you could take your pick. Like you'd wish that from God no cell phone. No reason to know. I saw this by the racist or a police that ran you was a two-ed air with a land. This horse had to enjoy your spectrum of this. The bus is. We're smashing with good people, trying to catch him. But nothing quite feels right since 1919. 1919. But 1919. 1919. You know where I am and with me. They beat the pants off great things. We still have some users. But also there was visually and we had cell seats. Me and Hawkins. Yes, he was comforted. I was there. Yes, he survived that. 1919. 1995. Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo! 2000 for sure sucks. The next year we'll have more love. I can see it now. I miss out to your met house. You might even find a cure for that guy might for more. When you feel your SUV, that gas will all be free. Even when was cut to our taxes. Devices will still go down. And rather will not use taxes. O sum will be found. I know there will be babies throughout the Middle East. All these will graduate and cry rise. Will be some straight fleas lettuce. Be a great year. I sure hated this year. Don't be forced arts. Elections. And no more flu infection. Seeky will be cleaners. And start jump to a feeling. Or let's all go top. The pride is 2,000. 2,000. 25. Well, I got it. 12.15. 60. W.K. I'm good-manned. It's you too. The Mohower David and show for the seven. Because that's just the way to fell out. Of course, I'm the only one who believes that. And that's just a kind of a nightmare. Falling in front of us. And we got their hurricane stuff. Now why isn't even an Ed bit? That it's just so politically correct now in America to take a gratuitous shot of Michael Morgan on us. Right. Well, okay. So, yeah. Just like when not this last year, but here before when he made the acceptance speech for boring for Columbine. And they're all bullying. And not all of them. But a lot of bullying. And he said, oh, no. It's really that well, why not? Why don't we respect somebody. It's got a pair of big balls and tells it exactly the way was. There was absolutely nothing in correct about what he said. And there are plenty of other actors and actresses and directors and producers and celebrity type people who've taken that opportunity to get up there and open up a mouth. What's wrong with that? When people are innocent people are dying. Oh, no. You can't say that. You just are rattling his spirit again and making trouble and causing us to earn up the crap, making waves. God. What a bunch of losses, man. This is the problem. America's turning a bunch of jellyfish. Fifty percent of the country just roll over and die. That's all. Do whatever you want to us. Man, we enjoy it. Stick it to us. And what did that God called you the day? Keep dropping the box and soap. I mean, so I don't think if he dropped it like an ivory soap and a package. You know, but what is like an a box? Yeah. Like, fine. We're going to send him a couple of cases of fat. And idiot, what is soap? By the way, if you tried the S.A. and I was, no, I don't think he would. I forgot the body wash. Why not? What do you mean you haven't seen it? I haven't seen it. Get out of here. You go in any like. A Walgreens now or CVS. And you know, there's 85 million different flavors and colors in the body wash. Soap is out, man. It's not a pansy thing either. Soap is out. Soap is as germs and hair and crap. And it's like a large. It's like wash. It's like putting a bunch of chicken soup and a refrigerator and letting all the fat go to the top. And like, grab it and slap it off a handful of fat and then pick it a shower with it. It's like a large. What's that soap? It's like lava. You ever use lava soap? I have. It's like shawng with pommus with a rock. I'll miss it. It does it really. Sure. Oh my god. Like scraping your your cells off. I guess the way to scrape it, it sells off. Sure. And some of the live ones too. Now we're not going to get any calls from that one too because they'll present. He's on and I'm not turning it on for a second. And I'd rather hear that. Billy talent. I don't know. If you don't have any but my doubt it. No. Well, that's his name. I can't help it. But we'll see if we can like fake our way through. I got 75,000 more bedtime stories here, which will never get to all of them. But yeah, we'll do the best we can under very difficult circumstances because it's an auguration day. And a lot of us just are just pining our pants over this development now. It's just in can that kind of talk about that pool. That's a good idea. This one obviously went hands down. It's not on those off-sided pools. The bush could get reelected. As a matter of fact, let me go back to that page again on our website. I know your world famous. Don't forget we got the other picture of Carmelo and the Caesar. We're like the same one to me. It's like that airbrush naval. I don't care. It looks like it to me. I know every inch of that body now. I'm going to want to discover her. What am I looking for? I'm looking for that thing from the daily mirror. That's. Oh, we got the. Tick your Jesus. We got Alfredee. But we got bush flipping a. You know, there it is from the London daily mirror. The four years more of W. And there he is with that stupid stupid natural idiotic look on his face. Look at like a deer in a headlights. How can 59 million 54,087 people be so dumb is what it says. Yeah. I have that on that website forever. This is a reminder that there are almost 60 million people in America that are than a box of rocks. Never than saw to us. Somebody comes in and they just lie through their teeth. They set off a whole bunch of thousands of people to be killed based on a pack of lies. Look at the difference man. Look at difference in the way media treated the monica thing. And can a star and all that Clinton gater like crap even light water, which sure Not to be a tempest and it can be Ping pot. As opposed to this guy, what is a illegal foolier of the country so do a based on lying. And the only time you're really here about that is even a Michael Lawrence movie Or when Barbara boxer opened up from out of the confirmation This is the committee of pro-graces nomination 16 to 2 Wednesday despite reservations of some Democrats who want a voting for it. The two dissenting votes came from Democrats Barbara Baucer, California, and John Kerry amassed Chooses, a little bit too late now, John. Now that the horses out of the barn in 75 miles down the road, now all of a sudden he's trying to vote up a little bit. But it be, that it will. I choose to vote my concerns not to overlook them. I choose to vote my gut, not custom for residing in committee meeting that preceded the vote. Kerry called rise president Bush's national security adviser, one of the principal architects of policies that he said have made the United States less secure, and he's right on that. They should install it to well during the election. Meanwhile, sources on Capitol Hill said some Democrats tried to make a symbolic protest by trying to delay the vote on our rights as nomination when the Senate convenes a three to seven known three hours after the inauguration, the coronation of King Bush. Aides said boxer and Robert Pertawes were doing a plan to give long speeches opposing the nomination and an effort to extend the debate till seven PM when the inaugural balls begin, and he certainly don't want to be extended that one to ball start, right? Last thing you want to do is extend it over the inaugural balls. The Aides said, Voxu and Bird, hope some GOP members will not want to stay in debate the nomination and the vote will be pushed back till next week. So what's that going to accomplish? While acknowledging that Rice will be confirmed eventually, some Democrats want to show that they're ready to fight the president and second term, amid grumbling that party leaders didn't stand up to Bush's first term. So we got two of them now. That's a really strong showing, isn't it? Wow. Take Kennedy in on this? No. Chris died. Joe Biden. He's Biden this time. No. Do you believe or not? No. No. He's just a rubber stand. He's just a right winger in drag. It's all here. When you say that you believe or not, he sure was a drag on Al Gore for years. I'll tell you that. Dragon right down to the feet. Dragon down into flames of defeat. Okay. Even Jeff Garcia was never his name. He said, whole lesson to Backelman. Another one should have been a landslide. It should have been a no brainer. Eight great plenty years. You know, forget about the blue dress. Eight years of happiness and prosperity for everybody. And Al Gore picked Julie, or been man. All I can say that is wow. What a lunatic. WQAM. Hello. Neil. Good afternoon. Yes sir. Good afternoon. Happy coronation day. Oh God. One comment.

Get out of town with that crap. I wouldn't waste two seconds listening watching, thinking about and the same with Limbaugh. Oh, but we want to hear both sides. Like you don't know. You just got through telling how predictable it was. They spent 20 minutes bashing Barbara Boxer. Like you had to turn it on to those and that was going to happen. Right? It's like it's like checking out the house. It's like checking out the flood reports. It's a find out that Miss Fudge is right in another. Lifting bashing column. Okay. Fashion anybody to the left of it. Till the hunt because Richard Melon's escape is paying the freight and he's a he's a sellout Faggot. Miss Fudge. What do you think they call him Fudge anyway?

Missed fields cookies, right? Uh, which I got one in the eating center, by the way. Uh, yeah, they got those big square fresh brownies, you know? And that would be great. Like in a big bowl with about four scoops of score ice cream on it. And then some hot fludge on top of the whole thing. And like all melted together into microwave. Just remember, I get your ashes. Yeah. Oh, hey, listen, I enjoy it. And the very least, if I can't eat it, I can talk about it. Okay? Don't know what's the thing to be on that. Yeah, like sucks.

I'll pop eyes going to be on the show a little bit later on. I'm going to say, that's going to be a little bit in the hand. I don't be talking about the Holy Father that way. I've ever said one day, and he bought a little smoke in there. And he got who he's just another Pollock. All of a sudden he's like, oh, what he's got to that line to guard. And now he's the, it is just it was. It is it way, right? Like I said, I know he's old, but I don't think he was around those days. I may be I'm wrong. It is it was my ass. Chris and four Latterdale says, I was encouraged to see that Iraqis installed a state of the computer voting system for their upcoming elections. Iraqis may have to vouch in search and send their way in, but they won't be voting for Papu cannon by mistakenly. Maybe those invertebrates know how can learn a thing or two. With quiet dignity, Chris and four Latterdale. What guess what Chris? They've been calling it. They may be cause Ohio's GOP attorney general launches re-ventient attack on election protection legal team. See, this like Carrie said, you know, when they then of course every time they heard saying something that was true and Valze, like all I didn't really mean that. Yeah, when he talked about these at a most rotten nasty dirty, you know, meaning the right way in the neocons. In the stunning legal attack, Ohio's Republican attorney general has moved for a censure against the four attorneys who sued George W. Bush at all, and in the attempt to investigate the Buckeye state's bitterly contested election. Robert Fertrakis, Susan Truitt, Cliff Arnebeck, and Peter Fkowski, were named by attorney general James Petro, I wonder if he's kind of Nick Petro, the Jackie from New England. In a filing video, a House of Incourt, Peacro Chargers, the November Moss versus Bush and Moss versus Moir, filings by the election protection legal team, were frivolous. Peacro demanding official censure and fines. How do you like that? We're fine. Oh, we're fine. Instead of evidence, contesters offered only theory, conjecture hypothesis and infective. The attorney general's January 18, and once the court of the suit said, a contest proceeding is not a toy for idle hands. It's not to be sued to make a political point. Or to be used as a discovery tool. Or to be used to win convenience or harass public officials. Or to be used as a publicity gimmick. But, to the far-red back says it's been peacro and Ohio's partisan Republican secretary of state Jake Kennedy's blackwell, who was stone walled the election challenge legal proceedings. Both have refused to submit any evidence to the court to refute the allegations in the election challenge case, claiming George Bush did not win a majority in Ohio, and Peter's office also refused to law any Ohio public election official to be opposed. Their cage has been rattled and they popped their court. Artibus said the chairman of the Ohio Republican Party is going berserk because he can't stand the fact that we're not going away. We're still pursuing the illegal investigation and illegal interrogations. They're just beside themselves because they can't withstand cross examination. And he happens to be, Peter was filing his widely viewed as revenge for the heavy toll taken by grassroots activists on the credibility of the Ohio GOP and Peter's core hordes secretary of state blackwell. Spurred by the lawsuit and extensive coverage at freepress.org and other websites and by an nationwide grassroots campaign that was escalated by Reverend Jesse Jackson and a series of public hearings about Ohio and in Congress some three dozen senators and representatives mounted the first ever challenge to a state's elected college delegation. You vote boys and girls, go get them. Or guess who I want them was, Senator Barbara Boxer. All right. She's the gal man. She's the man. Barbara Boxer for president and Barack Obama for VP. All right. Eight years for Barbara eight years for Barack. How's that sound? Beautiful. I'll carry a bit of it to me. I mean, see, I'm not going to talk about it. It gives me two to press. Like in 1988 when Herbert George Herbert Walker Bush. And the big knock on him was he was so wimpy. Wimpy died by, yeah, wimpy Bush. And then who are the Democrats picked a guy who could outwim from Michael Lukaka telling you they're in it. I think the fix was in man. And if you did a nation a worldwide search to find a wimpy or guy at George Herbert Walker Bush, you could only find Michael Lukaka, Joe Lieberman. Oh, wow. He wasn't around then. Too much. Who's busy and so will they go find president? Look at that full man. The inauguration is out right now. We don't have one call on that board right now. Look at that. Once the last time we saw this on this show. That's because of all day. All brother, you people really give me. We're trying to give you an alternative. We're trying to give it like something different to grab on to. Air B TV station. Even on your pop up postion out. Scott the accordion's crap going on. Five six seven. I give the numbers out once that I'm going to play a non stop crap. I'm going to play that music. That's a hard as the first one. No Disney child, which I can't stand this. No child. Five six seven. Five six seven. I'll just see something here. You have the phones are working. Uh, pound five sixty under Verizon. Sing it a Robis lines. There is not one call on that board. What are I telling you? That's just a few minutes ago that see they talk a good game. They talk a real good game. Oh, well, I want to hear what both sides have to say. Get out of here. Go put your head up Bill or Riley's butt okay and spin it around a few times. Put it on a spin cycle. WQA and hello. Yeah. Yes sir. Hey, that thing with some kind of laser right the other day. The thing, yeah. My wife works. It's the work for police department. And that's how criminals react. You know, they'll sit there and they'll lie and then we give evidence to them. They'll like why you're questioning my attorney. Why how do you do that? How dare you? You're very concerned. And harnesses. She could get more and more bitter. I thought this, you could see the steam coming out of our ears. That's how criminal act. And that's how the whole administration act. And you know how people can't see it is beyond me. Another thing is real quick. I know when you're on hiatus about five years ago. They had the inquiry about what happened in Rwanda. You know that movie's coming out right? Rwanda. Yeah. You know who the UN blamed on it? I'm listening. They blamed the Catholic Church in the Anglican Church of England. Yeah. For those other ones that were behind, you know, the priest and the nons and everybody going to feel for it and kill your enemies because they were not Catholic. The church. The church. The by my cutscene man. That's what they were saying. That's what they were saying. That's what they came down to. And he was listening. There's a little little pair of rap in the paper. And I should have been all over the place. I could turn because that was because they're good example of the Christian hate if you want to call it that. Hey man. Hey Christian. Hey. That's where it's at. Maybe Christian. Just ask the Reverend Thompson and our buddy and four. Lobby Dale there. It has the cornerstone of their ability. The answer to Dr. Kennedy. Have a great day, Palin. Hey, I'll see you at the board. I'll see you at the peace bridge for a piece. Five six seven four piece for the Tata. He is a piece for our Bosini. If he was still alive. I'll see. He was already dead by that time. Yeah. My Zini. Well, I mean, yes. Oh, the Tata. The family of these survivors. Right. In order to tag you. We hit three or two. For your clock this morning. Five six seven. Five six. Palin five. I just can't stop thinking about that movie. It's like I'm not really sure which I'm more obsessed with.

If you've sold them to them, we have the receipt. Those weapons in the world are, because those weapons were already destroyed years ago. Do we sell them? Oh, come on. By the way, you make a very good case just like that Barbara Boxu said, they had a kind of Liza. Those weapons that they were guessing the Kurds with their own people. Who sold them those weapons? Who was over the Shaken Sotomayor who says hand in 1983? Of course we were. We were also giving weapons to our women. That's the way to work. And so what are we screaming about the head weapons?

But the conviction means probable deportation for the alliance football escorted back to a native great Britain's lawyer said. His plea came on a eve of Jewish election with a 20 year old victim poised to testify. The woman who was since left Columbia was not in the court, but Manhattan's Supreme Court justice Jeffrey Atlas said she is signed off on the deal and then he shrugged. Before we took this plea, I went out of my way to ask if the complaining witness was in a court, Atlas said the judge also ordered personal to register as a level on sex offender and they should not order protection barring in contact in the victim. The fence attorney Brian Wallace at immigration officials already have lifted personals green card and of schedule may be deportation hearing. Then it will teach that silly as grit to be running around looking people. According to a criminal complaint, personals stood in the co-eds room about 350 in the morning on September 14th of last year. When the sleeping victim will work to find a defendant looking or feet in toast without a consent, when she yelled for the slightly built corner back to get up, he held her down and all I see, while she said in the beginning, held her down and sexually abused her, causing her pain and several injuries to complain said, why didn't say that in the beginning for a Christ's sake, huh? Jesus, the girl left the door unlocked because her roommate had lost her key. After the attack, the student went to university medical clinic told her roommate and friends about the incident, but she didn't notify authorities to February because police said she was too scared to come forward. Prosecutor Martha Sterley said the victim has left Columbia because she's getting a lot of ridicule from classmates, especially personals friends. Waller said his client decided to plead because he was the uncertainty of trial where he could have faced a minimum jail term of three and a half years of convicted, personals who lived in Fort Lodderdale and his mother left court yesterday with a comment of he sent in his March 16. He lived in Fort Lodderdale. Was that something he needed to know? He lived in Fort Lodderdale. I wonder what Cecil Collins, what he thinks about that, huh? Just take it into room and get in there, Licks. Yeah, that's right. It's a thing in South Florida, man. Just bust in through the window. Just take the screen to the door. Or just check and see if the door is unlocked and just go ahead and take a peek. So boy, is that right? Is our sports nerd a people would say, oh, yeah, I just wanted to take a look. So you ready for this pronunciation? Yeah, pure role. Pure role. How many of you heard? That's what the dictionary says. The online dictionary with the hero, audio pronunciation. See, that's why I never said it because it's just, I mean, it's kind of a role. Let me hit it again. Oh, I froze it up. Pure role. Or you're playing that off of Guayahu? Yeah. And then I just killed it. Pure role. Pure role. Sarah said it was like, parallel. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I mean, I'm not going to lie about that. Like, I'm saying that in the lecture, I'm a moron.

Five questions, six questions in and. Go, life. All the heartburn. Go, go, go, go. Every time I see. Go, go, go, go. That's a hard idea, which. Go, go, go, go. I see these words.

Somebody who brought this new two years new. Not good, man. I've talked to a lot of people. I've talked to some of them thoroughly. Brights have been very bright, but not a lot of them. There are a lot of them. A box of rocks. I still find it almost impossible. Impossible that this man could have even had the election closer to a fixed it. Yeah. No, no, no. I mean, how is it possible? Like that front page thing in the mirror says, how does 60 minute people be so stupid? Well, they are. Oh, and I got, I don't want to get the Josh Curtis upset because he's very, very militant about not only David and Boring and how great he is, but about how bad Avril Lavina is. Well, the channel that I'm like, the greatest people you know. It's an MTV 2. Uh-huh. Okay. Well, guess what video they just showed? Nobody's on the Avril Lavina. Then good video. And pretty good song. Do you say so? Well, I mean, do they put like, like, would you expect to see like, uh, some actually Simpson on MTV 2? Yeah. Or Hillary Duff? Yeah. Pretty much. Get out of here. I'm TV 2. I don't know. Yeah. Probably. I think I think when you said, I don't know. I think that was the honest answer. Why? I don't give it. Avril Lavina her do. I think it's because she's Canadian, eh? That must be. I think it's a ethnic thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Said to play a lot of baby crap on MTV 2. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60. I mean, why would anybody have a problem with Avril Lavina? I mean, she's cutesy. Her music is okay. It's not like she's going. She's kind of like, uh, I don't know. We're trying about those sports castes. She's like, you know, she's better than Joe Buck. I give Joe Buck a seven on a scale of 10 as far as sports casting. I give Avril Lavina an eight on a scale of 10 as far as her music and her videos and her old ambiance. I'm George might agree with that. Eight. What do you give her? That just started. Okay. Well, what do you give the fart? Nine. Oh, oh. What do you give her on a scale of 10? I, the her music is not particularly my style, but I don't know. I'm not talking about that. That's a freaking, uh, I give her a seven or eight. Okay. So what's wrong with that? That's not bad. I can 9 or 10. How many of you recording artists are like a 9 or 10? Josh, not many anymore. Sorry. No, they're out there. Such as, am I a bit? Yeah. An incubus? I like. Yeah. Sublime. Blink. Yeah. We know the stirb. Yeah. The stirb is good. It's about it. System of the down. Yeah. Oh, man. Get my CD. Can't sound it. I rock it. I'm still. I'm going to go on a call. Oh, why? I'm going to get in the forest. I'm going to go back to the hospital home and I'm going to go home alone. I think it's, uh, this is spectacular. We're not putting some of that in our operations stuff on it. But we won't. Not a word. Not a sentence. Not even like Abu Garrabe. Absolutely nothing because I will not be notified by, uh, I mean, you know, I can't change anything. But oh, boy, if I had the old magic wand, wow. Let's vote again. Like that bit says. Let's vote again and see if we can do it right this time. This is not possible. It is not possible. That's just going to short. It started with Reagan. That's when the moral, the oral majority in fall well and par Robertson, all these other right wing lunatic religiousities, fakers started rattling their political spheres. And now it's like they've taken a hold and cut you over. The hate mongers like Reverend Thompson and Dr. Kennedy fall well and, uh, Robertson, all of these people. All of these people. By the way, you see fall on a couple of days ago. It looks like I think they did the same bicycle pump to him that they did the Chris Myers on the SPN. He always did have a fat hit. But now it's like about four times the size of what was before. See, I guess that's what happens when your, when your boys, when the election man, when you get put the big fix in, you get a 12 head. Start looking a little like Jerry Lewis. WQAM, hello. Hey, you know, hey, you know, yeah. What's going on, man? What can we do for the family? Hey, that car melanin. You know, I pulled her up on the website. She's absolutely beautiful, man. I'm a pristine man. Oh, man, who is she? She's an actress or what? She's a model. She put just a. Yeah, she's exactly what you see. What you see is what you get. Don't ask too many questions. Just enjoy it. I do view a bragging about her. She has a big good man. There you go. Hey, listen, I know my flesh man. Hey, that's the way I like to muffins. You know, hairless man. Okay. It's right. Oh boy. I'm going to a Taco Bell right now. I'm going to come back. Huh? I'll see you somewhere. I'm going to Taco Bell. It'll be swell. It'll swell. It'll talk about you. And then we'll give you some score ice cream. Now, see you started that was so bad when you started with that. No, yeah, you did with the microwave. Waveable hot fudge. That. I mean, God only knows what's going to happen into a clock. I'm addicted to sugar. I put it on. That's why I put it on the pole. That's for me man. Sugar sugar. I'm admitting it. I'm desperately reaching out for help. Please give me a life wrap. Please. Or maybe some honestly turtle would be good. With some of the little chunks of turtle candy in it. They were out of that last time I was in a store. Thank God. But they had score. How about that guy at sea? Well, do the same thing with score ice cream. We did with fish food a few years ago. Fish food's great. I don't see fish food around that much anymore. Do you? No, but I don't look for it. I mean, I always check out the Ben and Jerry's because if they had the coffee coffee crunch, you haven't had that. Yes. Oh, God. Wow. Now, how about some hot fudge on that? Or I got an idea. You know, that big bowl I was talking about? Yeah. You take the big bowl. You put in like two scoops of score and two scoops of that. Coffee coffee crunch Ben and Jerry. And then you take the like hot fudge. I mean, we'll hot from the microwave and you like ladle the whole bunch. And then you talk it off with your cream in a couple of big meruchino cherries on top. And you drizzle a little bit of the juice from the meruchino cherries like on the whipped cream. Oh, my God. See, if anybody believed there is a God, if there was a God, he wouldn't let them invent this kind of crap that's killing us that tastes so good. All the stuff that's supposed to be good for us, like spinach and broccoli and cauliflower and carrots. By the way, I told you about the baby carrots, about how they grow. Nope. They don't. There is no such thing as a baby carrot. They're made from carrots from big carrots. So no, they shave them down. They shave them. Anyway, Carmella is on our website for 90% because you haven't. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. I know that I got my new care clip or maybe I'll search save in some carrots there by square time. Hello. Not there, busy pausing around. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. Excellent. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. Have you been a little ruler like that? No, excellent. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. It's been a little ruler like that. We can take care of the run. Dominic, you weigh him, hello. Yeah, Neil, please. Speaking. Neil, yeah, I got to retract his statement the other day. Stanley Harris got killed, the Pirate Skull, not the place for today. Thank you. Okay, nobody cares. We didn't care yesterday, and we still don't care. All right, we don't know who Stanley Harris says. We don't care about the Pirate Skull, get a live pal. Okay. Could have left it alone in the first time, nobody would own the difference. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil, I got to set the record street. Go ahead. It's kind of lizard-rice. Yeah. You see that big gap, too? WQAM, hello. Neil, yes, sir? Hey, I've been on your website checking it, Paul. Yes, sir? I think you guys might be missing the number one answer, especially for this crowd. And what is that? Mastervation. Yeah. I'm glad that he mentioned that, but of course, I guarantee a choice wouldn't be. And then we say sex other than sex. Right. You know, it's not like a former sex, all of me we would have to like draw you a diagram. So what did that we bleak it out? Okay, Joyce said it doesn't approve of that, or even saying the word, martial arts, the act. 560, 560, pound 560, and the Verizon, sing it a wireless line. So he's kind of liking that. It's like spending a lot of his time. Yeah, and that endeavor. WQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir? You know, I've looked at an years song that you were just playing about George W. Right. Remember when I was a kid? We can't play in him. Yeah. For being so stupid, it's the idiots that voted him in. Like the car where you had on and off of people with the fish on the back of their cars. Right. We got to thank them for the message. Well, now, let's see. You know what they say, water, six, it's on level. That's why he's there because he represents over just over half of the American population. Those red states and Yahoo Redneck in breeders and Bible-thumping Jesus Christers. And that's why he's there because he's, he's their guy. They can really feel it. It's sick. It really is. And Leafs spawned Bible alone, by the way. Yeah, exactly. Okay. Have a great day, pal. Yeah. Leave that sponge alone. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 6, yeah. I mean, these people are crazy as a bed bug. It's the purple-ticking winky. It's fun, five-day pants. Crazy people attacking cartoon characters. Of course, we know about the characters on South Park. I mean, you watch that. You definitely know the body of hell. Satan writes that. That's what George's chances are. Right down the turlet when he's there watching that. Actually, there are like two or three things we can still, I'm not going to stop that. There you go, play that. For the private. And that we can't play that one. What we can play that is. Job's a good, good. You can play that one. Yeah, we can play that one. You can play that one. Play it, paper, pick me. Yeah, and we can certainly also play. You go to hell, you die. Yeah. Or. I heard that. And I'm not going to read that. That's not the right. That's not me, yes. Yeah, and of course, there are George's very different days. My husband is a lost out of hunger. No, that was okay. It's going to be a good brief. Lawrence, I don't believe that made it extra long. Thank God. Oh, I don't get a rat's appetite. Yeah, that's good. I think that's enough. Ha ha ha ha. What a, see, and that's part of partial of the whole thing now. That's, that's why it's so ridiculous. Stuff that we used to play every day. Nobody complained, even the moral censors. Nobody gave a crap about it. Nobody gave a rat's ass. And now you can't say this and you can't do that. And you can't have a cartoon with a bear ass. And you know, how much crap I've been seeing this for a sense of favor, since that whole, that was just an excuse that Super Bowl thing. That's just an excuse to do what they're going to do for a long time. Sure. And it's start to do an espacious crap. But there's censoring everything in sight. And then Michael Powell's got the goll the other day to say, Oh, well, you know, we don't want to censor stuff like radio. As a matter of fact, we really want to, we want to strive toward achieving like a complete free speech. Right. Sure. You're doing a hell of a job, Mike. You're doing a fantastic job. All you are as another cell. I'll just like your father on the ear of cell out for the, the self-employed, as Jesus Christ is on the far right. That's what you are. Just try to pacify all the goodly two shoes. They've politically correct Bible-fumping, funny, volony crowd. Who are doing everything that moves. Man. I think that, I think this company needs a good power movement. You are listening to Neil Roger Sitz, who is his lady. I'm five six six six. You're eight. The round is no hour. Oh, right. Maybe one of the shoes that we're lacking in the call. They provided my type will be true by the dawn. You're seven. And seven is the one. You get out of it. I don't think one. Take a look. Don't panic about shit down. We got it. I'll be looking at seven. You got it. We won't attack this above. We got it. Where is the small piece of the, the rock solid? You sing non-elevatives with their gut to do this. And they really go through the old town, party, car, to do this. You've been, you've been, you've been. What they say and they check like they'll go on the tunnel. Oh, as they knew the music, the stage of the stage. So they've more, they too. Maybe on that chamber, we got it out. Push it out, it's getting into the tunnel. Oh, get down on your knees. You got it. When we can't even say the, your vice president's first name anymore on the year. And it's really said in America when he's the vice president. Right. It's one in five, sixty W to Q I am. Yeah, and some of these people out there, or can't believe there's anybody's spot and liberal stuff on the radio. Yeah, right. Everybody's got to be a right winner. Everybody's got a goose step along in a line. Everybody's got to be a fascist Bible something aluminum tick. See this is what they can't believe. What is actually coming to the left of Hitler on the year? Oh, that's got to stop. Guess what? Ah, Marine Dowd is also another liberal in the very liberal New York Times rights today. Don't know much about algebra. Remember the same cook. Don't know much about them. What's the name of that song? What a wonderful world. Yeah, our car funk will do too. We're pretty good. Everybody read this. Anyway, Marine Dowd rights law, as someone as the president of Harvard, has been pilloried for suggesting that women may be biologically unsuited as they've seen the mathematics. He may have a point. Just look at kind of these are rights. She's clearly a well educated and talented woman, versed in Brahms and Bolsheviks, who just have been rewarded for her loyalty with the most hummusimately second Bush cabinet. Yet her math skills are woefully inadequate. She can't do simple equations. She doesn't even know that X time zero equals zero. If you multiply 1370 dead soldiers times zero weapons and mass destruction, then equal zero achievement from his rise, who have the president vice president Ben Boosley the country of this war. Was Connie after doing figure rates at the ice skating rink when she should have been home learning your figures? She couldn't spend much time studying classic word problems. If two trains they should conquer with noon, one going south at 20 miles an hour, the one going north at 30 miles an hour, how far will these you've gotten by midnight? Otherwise, you might have realized that if two cars leave the bag they're imported noon on the main highway into the capital of Iraq, neither one is going to get there with any living passengers. Our 22 months of war have not ended up to that one major highway is being secured. It's lucky for Ms. Rice that she's serving with men who are just as lame at numbers as she is. The secretary Paul Wolfowitz couldn't be bothered to tell the correct number of dead soldiers when he testified before Congress and his boss Donald Rumsfeld didn't realize that using an auto-pens signature and more than a thousand letters to the relays of fallen troops ends up to zero solace. Our new topic, the matter is obviously not mastered fractions when she asserted during her confirmation hearing that 120,000 Iraqi troops had been trained Senator Joe Biden corrected her saying she was off by a bit. His calculation of training Iraqi troops is actually 4,000. Herz was 30 times there. But, too many men. Maybe she's confusing her probably in hypotenuse. See, there she goes again. Hypotenuse. You ever seen that word in print? Not lately. Her geometry is skewed if she thinks she'll not be more powerful than Rubian Dichini. Then she knows that the Pentagon has more sides than her Crawford trying to withdraw Georgia Laura. She could least have read the Da Vinci code. Then she would have learned about five on actually numbers that were occurring mathematical pattern in nature. When you invade a country, you should expect an insurgent serious. Five on actually matter calculated it. If you kill one Gihai, it's two more arrived at the biggest place. If you kill three, five more pop up. If you get five, eight more appearance so on. The incoming Secretary of State and her colleagues are Alas also lousy economics. After Bush officials promised that the Post were expenses were recovered by Iraqi or Alvervenus, we find ourselves spending a big and dollars a week of our own money. Ms. Rice and her fellow imperialists know so little about physics that they urgently jumped into spooky action at a distance, turning the country in hope to make into a model democracy into a training ground for international terrorists, a nucleus where new generation of radiographically dangerous genetics. How could they forget Newton's third law for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction? The administration needs a lesson in subtraction. How do we subtract our troops and replace them with Iraqi troops while the terrorist keeps subtracting Iraqi troops with car bombs and rocket propelled grenades? Condy may not know Einstein's theory of relativity, but she has a fine grasp of Chinese theory of moral relativity. Because they're the good guys, they can do anything. Disassembling to get into war, flattening Iraqi cities to save them, replacing these unique conventions with unconventional ways of making prisoners talk. The only question the bushy's know is this one, might equals right. It is puzzling that if you add x no exit strategy to y, y or we there, you get w2, George Bush's second inauguration. At Condy's hearing, she justified the Bush administration's vis-a-vis adventurers by saying, history would prove it right. I know enough about history to stand back and recognize that you judge decisions not at the moment, but how it all adds up she told a skeptical senator Biden. Problem is she's calculating but she can't add. For now, Sand Cook is right about the bushy's, they don't know much about history. Pretty good is using the more in-depth, it's always asked to throw a couple of words in there. I had potteness, I mean I know what that is, too, but once I'll ask to any southern imprint, geometry class. And of course, the five and odd season, I thought they were like with superior. Where they were once protecting a freighter one of West Coast. 560, 560, pound-560, and a Verizon and singular wireless line. How can you be spotting all this ant high-boist, oh Bush's god, Bush's our leader. Yeah, god help you man. You better pray there's a god because he's not the one that Bush's praying to. Other than sex, other than sex, what do you think is your number one addiction? Alcohol 77. A cigarette 72, mirror joining is 71. Everybody smoking smoking if you got it. It'll carry up a who cares. For Niagara 365, John 261, sugar 47. I thought I'd be like up near near the top of the list. Why would I rather be like back in a mid-pack? Then there won't be so many people grabbing for that ice cream into store. The internet 43, TV 37. I don't have any 32. Yeah, we believe it. Not me. Neil Rogers 26 sports 25, caffeine 23, computer slash video games 19, gambling a dozen, cocaine 11, cigars 9, complaining 8, just like that guy that called me for. Where? Where? Fill a royally stuck in bed about the vibramoxet. Let's see, strip club six, parallel one six, fitness four, religion two and chat rooms two out of 663. Well, if you more votes, it will have guess what? About 30? Three more votes, it will have 666, no. Oh yes, you know, I think Lisa is going to call back. It's a lucky. Why nine is calling? I haven't seen that in a long time. Do they QAM hello? Yes, hey, who's this? George? No, Neil. Neil. Guy, you know, this comelette girl, you have on your website all the time. Do everybody wants to know? Yeah, she drives me crazy. You guys, she's driving everybody crazy, right? That's where she's there. Well, wish you, she actress model both both. But why do you care? Because like I said, I can't get this out of here. Well, I will find out what during the break. I'll Google it again. Okay, I'll get that to IMDB thing. There's really not much there. You play they. She's a playmate. She's a model. She's a actress of sorts. Like every model playmate is an actress. She's been in about a half of a movie and she's there. Just enjoy. Just Google it. Why do I have to do it? You know, good. I am DB. Look up Carmella. Ditches on it. The Caesar and enjoy. Right? Right. Don't complicate things, man. We put it out there on the plate now. Have a great dinner. WQAM. Hello. I am a friend of mine. I am right. I'm off our time. I'm crying. Yeah. WQAM. Hello. Hello, man. Yes, sir. I have the written in your show for about five years. I've come to the conclusion that this is the double program. Right. Is this a, and even practicing this voice, you just started with it? I just started today about men and the go up and practice and while I've been on hold. Yeah. Sounds like you've been practicing something else. Five, six, seven, five, six, five, six. The pound five, six, the only Verizon and single the rivals lines. Keep practice and man practice makes portrait. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. Great job. Yes, it is. You're revealing full food. I believe that. Yeah. Come on. I think somebody just said he's ready. Close your eyes. Well, he said it's a revealing pool. And of course, the booze thing. He said, I believe that then he just reached for the glass. He said that was the school of bothersome. Five, six, seven, five, six, the pound five, six, the only Verizon and single the wireless line. They may have been a mid-leave in the material anyway. WQAM. Hello. Media. Yes, sir. Ah, I don't want to put it both. Video game. It's time to start this. Computer science video game. God of thanks. Get lost. Media is a flu shot doses go unused. After all the long lines of flu clinics. After all the anxiety over getting the shots. Federal health officials don't have a new headache. About two and a half to three million doses of flu by scene are going begging because the states haven't asked for them. That includes about 20,000 doses turned on by Kansas and about 36,000 plus to five by Missouri. While several quantities of flu by scene often go unused in a typical flu season, the serious shortage of vaccine is serious made health officials all the more determined to make sure that shots are not wasted. With the word, and I used to get a flu shot. Don't do it normal. Do you flu shot? Never had one. Josh. Uh, maybe early in my life. Out that I can remember though. People sneak up and poke them with guns. In the honest hands, you just get this straight answer. You guys like even during the inquisition they had. Well, of course they had better. Maybe that's what we're going to have. And we already had Georgia's inquisition. Maybe it's time for yours. Who needs the flu shot? I think it's just other scan probably. With the worst of the flu season likely yet to come. Officials say there's still time to get a shot. We've got a shot. This is a time on the vaccination season. Usually over said, Gene Santoli, if you are sentenced for disease control and preventions, national immunization program. But this is still a good time to be vaccinated. The disease hasn't peaked in your community. Well, I'm kind of peaked by hearing all this crap. Santoli said, I mean, look at me man. Old diabetic outer shaped fat, tub of crap, fat. If I had it, when's the last time I had a sick day? I don't know. You keep beating them. You keep it almost two years. Almost three years. And it was when I was down there. I had to, uh, TIA again because I was down there getting stressed out. Eating like a pig sitting around eating eating, eating, watching TV, eating, eating, going to the track, eating, eating, eating, eating, watching fat words, eating, eating, eating, eating, you know. That was it. That's, um, in between your scrubware. And that was it. See, the more I'm there, the worst it is for me. It's a very serious handshake of my health thing in South Florida. Just a whole ambiance, a whole lifestyle. I walk more in one day here than I do in, uh, any year in Florida. Where are you going to walk? Where are you going to walk? Maybe go to the soccer ass in park as far as you can from the, uh, green, the purple pyramid entrance. What the hell do you go to the bathroom? Yeah, that's about it. Walk after the garage about 10 steps. Hoping to your core vet. Drag to wherever you're going. Walk about 10 steps into public. Don't get a bunch of ice cream. Which they don't even have the, yeah, I guess they probably do. I don't know. When I was home, I didn't bother checking ice cream at publics because we'll all be of a craft that I was eating. I didn't need any extra incentive. Oh, here's the, for all you hockey fans out there. How many, uh, panther fans and really hockey fans we got in South Florida? But, uh, the mad ride. There's just a little tiny, it's not even a way a whole or next year. Cost certainty will be a component. See, there you go. Jeff Murray, finally, slung with bill waters. There's still talking about it. You want to know why? Cause they got nothing else to talk about. It's a hockey team network, uh, channel without a, uh, hockey season. Kind of a challenge wouldn't you say? Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. What did I just say, uh, I said myself. It's all over the world, I guess. So I turned out to see an end momentarily. It's just, oh, I've got you spilled this ball martin. And, in fact, we said that, you know, in all of our subsequent meetings, all our meetings from now on, there would be discussions. We would be measuring progress. But, to be fair, that's our very boring prime minister, Paul Martin. Wow. Talk about a dead fish. Anyway, so the deal is this, the last hope for the NHL hockey this season may rest in the owners hands today. Ready for that? No. Hoping. Yeah, you are. You want some hockey, baby. Come on. Hoping against. Hope you want to hear. Gelly. But you're some names and miss it all up. Hoping against. Hope that the other suddenly will rise up and rise up against Gary Bettman, salary Catholic Sation. The NHL fairs association is believed to have called it executive counsel to guess what city? Trudder. Trudder. The next question is, in the second case, today's the day two showed out with league representatives for this is unexpected progress. That was something happens. They'll be there. Oh, okay. Let's do it. The size of the NHL lock out will mean in Toronto today, continuing discussions at the beginning. Yesterday, with secondary level talks at Chicago's Francis over here airport. Sources said there was no significant progress yesterday. No philosophical shift that would save the season. Instead of four score and five-story years of Santa Cup continuity, both sides agree that the time is almost runoff for hope on a 2005 season. There can be little doubt left which side wants to play hockey and which seems content to watch basketball. The affairs associations making all the concessions doing all the employing and is always running in the Veterans' demand for a hard salary camp that would be illegal less collectively bargain. The players laid a step at the same of the season and saved the sport, the open embarrassment of not producing a stand-up cup champion. For the first time since the 1919 Worldwide influenza epidemic produced five hours of secondary level talks yesterday. The highest speculation arose that the size made of the scarce ways of gradually buffering. Now, butterman, it says buttering. Buttering, the PAs offer of a luxury tax on the league's 30-minute dollar hard-camped demand. I think they really meant buffering, but it says buttering. Now, it was slamming it on. Other speculation suggested that the owners may have sought away for the players to guarantee that their salary rollback offer was on savings in Beijing. Sources said, however, there was little movement. A veteran was like maybe a couple of good bowel movements and look at the time now, I'm way past for the break. And the most encouraging outcome is they were the simple agreement to continue talking in Toronto today. The parties had a good candid dialogue in each health vice president Bill Daily said and several developments as well. Well, thank God for that. How do you like that? Well, you're misted, man. After Eisenhower had a second heart attack and we had to read in the news. I keep saying this because you don't believe me. It was in the newspapers that the president had a good bowel movement. Now, I don't just think that's important news that American needs to know to be reassured. We heard a lot of things. We heard a lot of things. Colin for like months. Oh, God, almighty. 114. If, of course, I didn't have an astrologer like Nancy, so he was a little more concerned about things. 114. If, 560 WQF Armstrong for like president and general manager David Rich called a slice week to announce that he's overstocked with Mustangs. He's an Armstrong fordable blowout these new 2005-6 solar mustangs for as little as 17,900 bucks. That's a savings for you of over $3,500. If you can. Plus, I have a couple of 2,000 form models left and get this. They'll let these go for just 12,499. The original MSRP was 18,60, which saves you over 5,600 bucks.

This station's had more morning shows in last few years than Curtis got pills. I've never in my life. I never dreamed that I could work on a radio station that was so erratic and unpredictable and outrageous and irresponsible and it's crazy people. Great. Lunatics, you work for a lot. Not like this, not like this. At least most places I worked to show it beyond for like six months a year or something like that. Not every five minutes. Oh, one day it's Howard Stern and it's Joe Rose and the Mojau would David in. We just keep swapping howards is what we did. By the way, in case you missed it, it was my fault.

Okay, thanks for the man who's seen. Here we go again. The food pushers, but that's good news. I didn't ask about that yesterday because there's so many good places that just are in South Florida because they know that there are too many people in South Florida who just gum their food. They have no teeth. They have their teeth facing in the glass while they're eating. No, that's true. I don't. When the average age is death plus 10, I mean, why is it good restaurant going to come to town? We got a few, but oh, no, I heard moldy of it. They talking about all the good restaurants.

Forget about a man. Well, the best piece of advice I could do to anybody. Do not get into this business. Worst now than ever. I was said that years ago and now I beg you. Don't do it. I would say you lived a regrett. But you might not even live a regrett. You're a young man, pal. You've got your whole life out of you. Don't do it. At least to people with cemetery village. You know, good for a few laughs behind their bank. Oh, hey. Plus the good thing about cemetery villages. Just like just like when I worked at KAT, which is starting at a great new format. By the way, January 31 with that compulsive gambling bill. Paper crit. Um, is that all those old forests that used to give me crafty raw dead? I'm still going strong. I feel pretty damn good.

Forget about Korea and the New Ferto to Manta for right wing is really good over and over to our head. That is right, as of. Weth is a vast destruction. 3,000 people killed are not for button. Let's exploit them instead and their loyal to me, Dominic. Going after Satham to, playing Kato Sama, there's no longer mention of the name in Lodden, but no it's easy to send all of them to be in complacent, believing every word of this archaal administration. Package drove us by fear, community, and manipulation and a right wing is really good over and over to our heads. And I read, as of, weapons of mass destruction. I'm dying out of here. I've got grip, a lot of civil rights is the right that we're paid. We're all suspects now, not the ass, proper things. I have nothing to hide, table partners all are saved.

There are a bunch of you, man. Can you imagine a money he's written up with at the Marlon stuff he's doing? Plus he gets to sit up there with David and boring, a real hot shot. Now, what's going to happen? Who's going to do the color line again? Is that the boobies going over to TV? Who's going to work with the van boring? Who can say? Maybe you'll be in line for that. What? Why? You don't aspire to do that? I haven't thought about it, but it's not like even if I did, they just throw me in there. Well, who's going to put in there? The beast looks the Marlon's that are hiring the person's right? I understand. It's not like, I'm on the top of their list. Well, why not? In other words, you said something to cross them, well, don't do that. That's the good real off-time. And I'll let you to say how to speak her Allen Benz, Marlon's president David Samson. Remember David Samson? I can never follow that, sir. Is it under Samson or Delilah? I forgot. I didn't put it in there. You didn't put in yours? I put it in mine. Oh, it's in there. It's in there. It's in there. It's in there. It's in there. Oh. We did it. Anyway. They did it. We did it. Samson says that only does the team need a new ballpark when they were tractable roof because of windways and fan discovered. But also because of the team stadium, we still have to be new to that in 2010 because Wayne told him, good last year out. Samson is seeking $2 million a year for 30 years. He said that money would allow the team to borrow $30 million. Not 30 million. Why do we enclose the current funding gap toward a $360 million stadium? The Marlon's have deadlocked with city and county officials over plantability. 38,000 seat retractable roof stadium near the Orange Bull. The Marlon's have offered to pay $192 million of the projected price tag with taxpayers picking up the rest. This entire transaction and in fact the future of baseball in South Florida hinges on securing a sales tax rebate from the state. Samson wrote, Samson's letter described as the money is a rebate, but under state law the money is actually a subsidy that does not depend on how much sales tax revenue the state generates. Samson also asked, then existing two-minute receptionity for the Marlon's that they knew the name Dolphin's state informally peep park. Be reassigned that they mommy dolphins that don't know Wayne Heizing who wants all the Marlon's and is the team's landlord. State law prohibits the team from getting more than one subsidy. The letter comes after Marlon's official visit lost Vegas in December meeting with Mayor Oscar Goodman, Oye. About a possible move. Benz Republican Panama City said yesterday he hasn't studied the Marlon's new request for plans to review it. Senate President Tom Lee Republican a brand-new real hard ass appeared less receptive. Wait till you're what he said. He said, I thought we had already appropriated money to help to move to Vegas. I was very disappointed that they publicly announced that negotiations and discussions for the last Vegas, and I don't negotiate with terrorists. He said, I'm not a client at it. Man, we've appropriated money to help to move to Vegas. We're a clown. Probably some Brandon. What do you expect? He ever dropped your Brandon a night of, oh, that's a member on the way to Tampa. It's for a month and a half. Why then you know what I'm talking about, Brandon? It's like, that's what isn't that where the lightning played their first season and the cow pasture? Yeah, I went to a couple of games. They were playing with that tense that tempted the arena. No, remember that? Brandon is not that bad. So it's all right. As compared to what? Two-way. It's compared to sweet water. It's compared to what? Amocally. Yeah, Macho is a dynamite, dynamite. Perfect. I heard JJ took retirement there in Macho Lee. Not JJ Walker, Jimmy Johnson. Anyway, the marlins have been asking for the estate's help in securing a state in for seven years. But more urgency was added to the biggest push for a ballpark. After P.B. Park, a official told a marlins last month, they will not be allowed to play there after the 2010 season. In 2000, Governor, your fat ass Governor, Jay Bush rejected an attempt by the marlins under the then owner John Henry, who was a hell of a race horse. He was the sign-up sure of the racing ministry, a Coina Phil Georgia. To build a new park using a tax-on cruise ship passengers. Are you following a this good? No. In 2001, 240 million dollars. Thanks, Craig, for new park data. The final day of the legislative session. And it took last year by the marlins to get the 60 million dollars somebody also failed. So they want some money, honey. If you want the marlins, cough up some cash. That's what it boils down to. And I got over there in Brandon, man. What a redneck heart ass. Wow. Terrorist, my ass. That's pretty, pretty extreme, I would say. Pretty radical. And by the way, Josh Cordis wants to mow on the stick in a mouth. It's going to be so working with Dave Ann Boying. Other than sex, what do you consider your number one addiction? Alcohol 86. cigarettes 81. And of course they go, I mean, hand in glove, right? Right. I always think of Lauren Bacoll when I think of Boozen cigarettes. Okay. And Humphrey Bogart. Well, all those movies back then. That was how to drink at a cigarette the same hand. That is correct. I'll build Holden by the way. Had a bottle in his hand when he found his body. Oh, what got that? For anography 77, what was Bill Holden? A bottle. And you know what the someone they heard of boys? Anybody have a heart or a liver? For anography 77, Marijuana 76, John Food 69, you got me going on a food crap on Bri of said. Sugar 51, the unit 48, television 45. I don't have any addiction 35. Lyr, Neil Rogers 31, sports 31. What's after 31? It's 26 with caffeine. Computer slice video games 22, gambling 13. There goes the money and along with your money. How does that go? Here comes the money and the money and there goes your money. Well, we don't want to say that. People in the dog track love me already. Don't they? They do love you. Well, I'm just saying it's just an old funny line. Here comes the money and there goes your money. If you're going to gamble, take the money like I told you. That's discretionary income that you can afford to lose and have a good time. Have a great time. Gambling 13, cocaine 11, complaining 9. Yeah. There's nine script club 7, heroin 7. Fitness 4, religion 2 and chat rooms 2 out of 7 and 4 2 votes. It seems to be once upon a time we did a similar one on this pool and we had a lot more heroin addicts. Interesting part of that is they're all dead now. So I wasn't wondering where to that part of the audience goes just that they're all dead. Got it? Got it. 19. I still think, dear, I was pretty good in that movie. What's the name of that movie again? I wrote it down. Hi, everybody. Tom? The Irish something earlier. The last of the high kings, a very mediocre movie with a real hot sex scene like toward the S.N.

You're running as you share boarding the US or anywhere to react and speak in a mess with people. Your ran accuse the United States of trying to disrupt its nuclear negotiations with the European Union by evoking the threat of a military strike and war in Washington would respond to any unwise measure. With reliance on enormous popular support diplomatic capacity and full military capability, the Islamic Republic of Iran will firmly respond to any unwise measures of a plan for a ministry spokesman, Hamid, Riza Asfifi, Saddam St.man, respond to recent comments by US officials. On Monday, President Bush said he could have a lot of resort to military action if the US failed to persuade Iran to abandon a nuclear energy program. It charges as a cover for developing when a bomba. I sure hope they don't have those aluminum tubes. And you know how much we keep hearing about Valerie Plain when Joseph Wilson is a scandal. That's not a word. Not a word. What is this? What about Paul? What does that say? Paul Pills? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paines? Paul Paine? Well, I got to ask, guys tomorrow that's it. I'm writing a column under your belt.

From a distance, U.S. Secretary of State President of Condolese Arrise also called this week for World Action to keep Iran from building nuclear weapons and repeated day, it's correct to Holly Islamic Republic before the U.S. Security Council for sanctions. That's that impudent U.N. and it's so bad and evil, but when we need to have somebody you know, somebody come in and intermediate, we call on them, or at least we go through, we go through the motions of it, and then we go and bond the hell out of somebody. We see such moves as a psychological campaign and political pressure, our stuff he said. He said one of the aims of the U.S. administration was not to help and encourage Europe to peacefully settle some of the disagreements through the policy and talks, but to disrupt the Iran EU nuclear talks by pretending they're unsuccessful. Oh, we would not have to do that. You don't want to like to mess with those neocon plans, right? You're nuts in the full-way plan. Yeah, I'm messing up all my plans, man. Can you give you off the hook-time? For all time, say. Can't do it, Sally. And then with an out of the head, but I'm being, that's the end of Tessio. Once he ever go to normal, he sleeps with a fish.

When I create, he's looking at Brassi. It's an old Sicilian message. Luca Brassi's six with Ephesus. He was so good in them. They're all great. We are Godfather intensive. We're score ice cream intensive. We're food intensive. We're, that's another one. For the list. What? Addicted to the Godfather. Okay. Just the Godfather. I have to say that get some votes. Stop, stop, stop, my man! Yeah. Yeah. All right, Tony, right now. I think girl, it's going to get some votes. It's a matter of which. That's what you write in this game. It's a song. From all our comedy, would I young girl? That was there? Uh-huh. That young girl over there? Yeah, that's a big fat, uh, respawn over there. You know, she's in Godfather 3. Remember she was at the, you know, you're a little cameo, right? It was the, by the way, was the Manucci Foundation. Yesterday I had the Saducci, Saducci, but it was, the, the Sanucci was the Dante, who took him to the Godfather. But it was the Manucci Foundation and Godfather 3. That's, uh, Sofia Copola. She's given him the, uh, and he, I want to present you with check for 80 trillion dollars, uh, for the, you know, whatever. For the Catholic Church. Well, and of course, the implications in Godfather 3 that there's corrupt in the church. Oh, no. All those references to the Vatican banking scandal and that guy committing suicide in the hang of himself. Oh, that's really bad, you know, this existed to my peaky, panky and the Vatican church, like maybe under the Pope's robes even. Maybe that's why he's hiding something at cash and so that poor know they got over there. When are you people ever going to learn when are you going to stop? Subsidine. That guy to call yesterday. It's enough to break your heart. There's a guy that's one. There's one guy, you know, finally saw the light. A little light bulb went off of we're sent to hand. Not going to continue subsidizing this, uh, petta file organization. This corrupt piece of crap. All those poor celebrities man all over the world, and especially in Latin America. Oh, brother, reproducing like rabbits. Oh, and then, oh, and the store we had yesterday about Spain and the condoms, right? They said, oh, we didn't say them like that. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, they know. Yeah. I guess the folks written this sent a whole bunch of bishops there, they're more solid children or something if they didn't cut the crap. Oh, we didn't say no, we're not recommending condoms. What are the what are condoms? They have nothing about it. They said something about a Trojan horse that's about as close as they know. God, they were talking about current. Ah, kind of we have those little kind of good like those olives in the U. M. T. Spanish olives. Of course. Boy shops said some supporters presence urge to press van on same sex marriage by the bigoted in the end of all his historical Bible something God squad. That's the fact it's the fact it's the first they're going to do this. Then I'm going to take our children the fact it's of course that I worry about the Catholic Church. Except maybe Bob Jones. He's worried about president Bush came under far from some social conservatives yesterday for saying he will not aggressively lobby the Senate to pass a constitutional men in banning same sex marriage during a second term. Oh, my God. Probably the state is Tony Perkins. Oh, my Tony Perkins. He was a different Tony Perkins speaking of the pan King House people. President the family we search counsel on other right wing Bible something funny. Well, always when you see any organization with the word family and I think right wing think Nazis. Okay. Tony Perkins president the family research counsel and they rank and file Bush supporters. Inundated the White House with phone calls to protest Bush's comments that interview published Sunday in Washington Post. Clearly there is concern among conservatives for a concert. I believe there is no important issue for the president's second term that the preservation of marriage. How do you like that? For a bunch of crazy people. We have almost 1,400 American troops in Iraq where Iran is like I'm a bubble right now. We're like right on the edge. We can't even put them on a fast enough we're spending it so fast. And the most impressive pressing issue is the preservation of marriage. In other words, to put our bigotry in the law, constitutional amendment to make sure them fangots don't get married. Yeah, it seems to start a time-minnery of focus on the family. See there's never word again. Focus focus on the family. He said, I'm sure that the White House headlines are letting up all over. See, one thing about those bastards man, they are far business. They are driven. They don't mucky around man. They light up the phones. They send the telegrams. They got them up to their armpits. Like Howard Beale said up to their chin and telegrams there. In a post interview, Bush for the first time said senators made it clear to him. The amendment has no chance of passing unless courts strike down the defedible defensive marriage act which protects states from recognizing same sex marriages conducted elsewhere. Childhood is to the actor, pending in states from California to Florida. And speaking of that, after 27 years together, Nancy Wilson and Paul Schwannweather got married last summer. Massachusetts along with thousands of other same sex couples of one of their unions legalized. Massachusetts right now is the only state that allows gay marriage, but Wilson and Schwannweather went to their homestead of Florida to recognize their union too. They're attempting to get that recognition. Noah soundly rejected yesterday when a judge is missed their law. So it upholding a federal law that lets states ban same sex marriages. Again, another reason why they don't need this constitutional amendment is divisive and hateful sick thing. This is illegal shot heard around the world said attorney Ellis Rubin who filed the lawsuit on the women's behalf. You know, there's a guy talk about a turnaround. He was right in there with an e-dibron. He was one of the biggest of all folks and all of a sudden now he's a Mr. gay rights. He's a mercenary. There you go. He filed the lawsuit on the women's behalf. He said we're not going to give up. This case is that a result of the U.S. Supreme Court. And I said that since the day I filed it said, Ellis Ellis Rubin Rubin, Rubin I've been thinking. Also, Wednesday, the Louisiana Supreme Court unanimously reinstated an anti-game marriage amendment to the state constitution that was overwhelming to improve my voters in September. So all you facts out there, you want to get married? Come to Canada. That's it. No problem. We'll get to hit the gay white North and then go back home. 154 at 5.16 WQM.
