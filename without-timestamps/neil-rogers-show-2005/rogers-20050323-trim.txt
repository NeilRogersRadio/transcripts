Right I I was gonna talk to you about something the steak house at the Seminoxino Yeah, I ate there a couple weeks ago. It is really good. Huh, how come you never mention Christian Lees? I got this fancier today from Brian the Ling who says he's not Chinese. Maybe he's a panda bear. Yeah, Ling Ling. Yes He's in the is great. I don't know. I need a lot of steak there since you didn't do me to greet you's coming at least twice a week Over the years his tanks still goes there, but never mentions it. I go there a lot. Yeah, so I'm gonna see how I've mentioned it I don't know is damn it. It's good I like it season by the way now. You hear the the outcome on roots Chris? Yeah, we're both wrong Well, I'm snatched There was no ifs buts or rans it's right from their website if you're gonna be that much of a hard ass tonight It like the people are roots christ on over the name came from it didn't come from her son or her husband You know, I don't know where the name came from a tank I let me just tell you which the story was okay because I Used to go there a lot in the 70s okay The place was called Chris is steak house. She bought it right she was married. She got the horse He was you know as part of the course me forcey bought it. She didn't and part of the deal It's on the website. She got divorced long before she bought the restaurant With her 22 last 22 grand she mortgage the house. Hey the story that they told in the world In the seven miles care about what they used to hang out when I used to go in the world and I used to eat there a lot Okay, and the deal was When the show you open it well maybe it was a local rumor, but once you moved to the other place She had the change in name because she didn't want the ex-husband to share in any of the No other profit sales of the settlement the deal she had when she bought Chris a steak house was that as long She kept it in the same location she could keep the same name Yeah, there was a fire she had a move between other location and so she called it roots Chris steak house Now you think about that? Why would she if there was a fire and she moved to another location? Why would she have to change the change in name? I just got through telling it because it was in the contract when she bought the restaurant And if she kept it in the same location He could keep the name that if you ever moved to another location, she couldn't keep the same name I'm telling you it was part of the horse and I know I'm full of it. I'm telling you I'm so on their website and I don't care what the website says that website is wrong Have to time and I'll tell you something else What do you do? Have to have people in the world and that was on the roof Chris website. That was the story in the world When she opened up the other place are you people listening to this? I think you're losing it. No, I had a good day would mind by the way, yes, do you know I'm quite of that blind look for you talk about blind look Well, that's what the machines are you well, of course they are, but it's all timing man It's whatever luck time right walking and there's one machine open there that always kills me And I sit down I got no choice and but I'm being I just didn't know anything I have a question for you. Yes since they said no slot machines in They county voted it down right how can the Mickey circus ask for slot machines? Yeah, based on the law that what's what exists and because you know the fact that the seminals and the Mickey well First of the seminals are asking for this. I got that story, but the fact that they're doing this I mean you talk about a bunch of hypocrites these are the people that put up almost $6 million to lie and scare the daylight out of the people of the state of Florida back in November and now they're well You know monkey see monkey do they got it we wanted to which you know There is a title to get it since the state constitution whatever forms are gambling are prohibited by the state constitution So if I'm counting but no, I don't really don't think so I think I'm I'm not sure but I think with the Indians it's the state So the state allows any form of gambling anywhere in the state I believe that legally they're gonna get it. Oh, I'm sure they were they ought to get it. It is there to get a default back Boy oh boy, but isn't that unbelievable other the ads that they put on the year. Oh, it's gonna destroy our family tourism and images I'll flirt in the crime, you know I mean it's one thing if you go to a fine restaurant and you want a good meal But if you want all the food in the restaurant they call you as the Chinese say a hazard and it's exactly what the The sentence, right?

matter what flavor you buy when you like temperate to the consistency it's supposed to be in a microwave it's like watery it's like water maybe if you have your look at it would you listen to me good ice cream no matter what you do to it is never watery hog and does is watery I rest my case period so the flavor you're right could be really good but don't get to hog and does buy I think even public brand is that makes dulce de la te la te la te I some other brand it probably do it isn't like you know 50% water maybe not 50% maybe more like about 30% 70% hey if you look at an mirror in 70% of

How do you like that? That's gonna just get that on their right away place. Flora's Flora's And that oh my god. Here we are back again to what was that one the other day? Fulios. Remember that? Fulio. That was excellent. That may have been your all-time best. FL ORA. My not enunciating. My not articulating and my not saying. Don't know. How would you spell Flora as in Flora and Fauna? Yeah, I got it. FL ORA A. Apostrophe S. Flora's pizza 79th in Biscayne. So it's still great to know for your It says any. Thank you, Edda. I just wanted to show you a show there. Because if they are Man, it's good stuff for us. Excellent. I feel it. It's good. Well, if it's the same as used to be, which I'm sure it is. They also were sponsored for about five minutes. Now, they were sponsored for years at IOD. Long time used to bring us pizza all the time, Flora's. Now, if you guys got any pizzas yet or what? No. Well, why not? Why is that? I mean, we got steaks yesterday, which is so much harder to cook in transport and by the way, how did it, I guess it came out okay, because the steak doesn't travel well. I don't know. You mean you. Huh? Everything was just fine. No, but you know what I'm saying. Steak is not one of those things that travels well because you've cooked it. And then by the time you put it in the thing and you transported, it just doesn't you. And like pasta, pasta doesn't travel well. Pizza travels great. Worked out just fine. Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Don't get emotional about it. Now, okay, realize it was a big feast. The price was right. It was probably made you day. You probably had a lot of time to sit and kind of plate the life, last night on the throne. But anyway, pizza we are blue in South Miami. It says the best in crust pizza in South Florida. The best pizza ever anywhere, he says at Paisano in Vienna, Austria of all places. How do you like that? The worst ever was in Pizza, Italy. So if you want good pizza, don't go to Pizza because you'll get pieced off. Pizza, Italy. I heard it leans a little bit. You know, it's kind of off-sided. So there you go. We got pizza. We have blue in South Miami. Got it? Good. Let's see after losing two consecutive appeals in the federal court. Terry Shavos, parents vowed that they didn't take their fight to the US Supreme Court. As there's severely brain damaged daughter begin her fifth full day without the feeding tube that has kept her life more than a decade. In a two-to-one ruling early, the epitome of the 11 circuit quote of appeals in the latter said, the parents failed to demonstrate a substantial case on the merits of any of their claims that Terry's feeding tube should be reinserted immediately. There is no denying the absolute tragedy that has been fought before in this is Shavo. The ruling said, we all have our own family, our own loved ones, our own children. However, we're called upon to make a collective objective decision concerning the question of law. In his descent, George Charles R. Wilson said, Shavo's imminent death would end the case before it could be fully considered. In fact, I failed to see any harm in reinserting the feeding tube. He wrote, out of peel was still pending in the 11 certain court of appeals. One of the Shavo's right to do process was violated. And then, of course, if they don't get the way there, or regardless of which way that in the full court, then they'll go to the Supreme. Now, the Supreme Court's already twice refused to hear this. They don't want to undo it. I just wanted to ask that in passing. They've left it to the states. As it should be, not all conservatives are happy with the decision by Congress and President Bush, Winter Vena, and the Terry Shavo case. Somebody to say the yesterday to new law-long, a federal court review of the cases in example, of the big government they've always opposed. Did I just say that yesterday? Yep. Yeah. You know, that left side from Earth, Christ by the way, half of the time it's wrong. What was he talking about? Speaking of pizza, I think he was a little bit cheesalvin. Let's see, vetoes in pop and Owen Curl Springs has Bob and for Lord of the El Vitos. They used to be a really great vetoes right there in North Miami Beach right across from where the unicorn used to be in their both gone. That was a sponsor of Hanks, I believe, and mine vetoes. Remember that? Yeah, you do 160-thirds street in North Miami Beach. Right. In fact, do you write kidney quarter or crispy creme donuts? You know, the original crispy creme there? Yes. And would he have an average right next to what? Well, right around the corner used to be vetoes on the other across the street and unicorn was down the street. Okay. And they're both gone. Chained you hoods for the pool. Here's the fact that I haven't even taken any calls on this yet. Well, we'll have a thousand pizza joints for the pool. Frank owes pizza in North Miami Beach. Frank, the owner has been in Venice for over 20 years. Real Italian pizza. That's so good. It's a sin. It's open 18 hours an end. The pizza's always great. Also tell Josh that mommy velvet has a binaite on Fridays. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, Phil says I figure I live a better time and feel more comfortable. Now let's see try to say. Huh?

I kind of like, uh, loosen him up a little bit. In more ways than what I'm sure. Do you say so? Just relax. Okay. Just come in. Look, if you're going to have to take some crap, if you're going to get all this good free food, right? Hey, and the big bucks that go along with it. That's right. Ha ha. Go to me here for. Not all conservatives are happy. They simply say the culture of life or whatever your call it means that we don't have to pay attention to principles of federalism or separation of powers is certainly not a conservative viewpoint. Said the anxious representative former representative Bob Barr of Joja with a little Hitler must ask. She's got Alan Lickman who chairs the history department in American University in Washington said the intervention of Congress in Bush to try to overturn this isn't by shybore. So I've been not to prolong her life as the antithesis of several conservative principles. It conquers a lot of what those behind it say they believe the sanctity of the family, the sacred bond between husband and wife, the ability of all of us to make private decisions without the hand of the government intervening, difference to the states and localities as opposed to the centralized government, Lickman be saying, and he of course happens to be absolutely correct.

She has it listed on the internet auction site eBay where the top thing yesterday was 152.50. But Dives his confidence should get hundreds, even thousands more. I'm not selling it for 150, too. She said, it will go for that. It's going to go high. And guess what, Diana? What do you're talking about? I think maybe you're a little. Dives are a jewelry designer. Hope's goldenpalas.com and online gambling concerned based in Antigua will buy the frying pan. The company bought the virgin married sandwich. And November displayed it at the Casinos locally and in most wages. It goes with the cheese, it really does. She said the pan. Dives are made the sandwich, white bread from publics and landlakes American cheese, 10 years ago for breakfast. After taking a bite from the diagonally cut sandwich, you notice what it looked like a woman with cascading here on the cinch that bread. She concluded it was the virgin married since her look at gambling had improved. I must add the virgin married in my pocket yesterday. It would buy, you know what? Damn it. Okay, so I'll show off it in a loser. After placing the curiosity in the nest of cotton balls and a plastic box and keeping it on a shelf or a decade, she decided to auction off.

For all your people that are big in the guys in old men in a dress, talk about needing a real serious cube. Oh, see they're not telling you this, but here's the real MS as they say in Faranza. The MS, Pope John Paul the second is vomiting, suffering strong headaches, and not responding well to his medications and it's telling you news agency before the yesterday, but the pot of chief doctor dismissed speculation that the Pope will be hospitalized again. The app con news agency, quoting unnamed sources also reported that John Paul, aka dead man in the chair, was suffering from overall weakness as he recovered from surgery to ease a breathing crisis. He's doing a lot of, oh, oh, oh, oh, I can't indicationally. I'm dying on the hands. What about those? No hospitalization of John Paul the tooth is planned the antinoosegents he quoted for the idea saying Dr. Redolfo Prietti. The Vatican confirmed Tuesday that John Paul would not hold his traditional audience today. Although it wasn't known. Now what is today? Or he just says that I went today as something we like today. It's something like Easter. I know we got good Friday on Friday and he's just Sunday on Sunday. Yes. And I'm not working in Friday just because I'm going to be Catholic. If I can work on you, I'm Kipper. I might as well take some religious day off, right? Right? So there you go.

And when he walks, he walks with his way. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. I'm five. This is a year, dinner. I'm a TV. It's 11 18 at five. It's the WDQM happy Wednesday. Two years. Don't forget George and Miguel and Volca Brian and a bunch of other winners. We'll be at Treasure Island happy. Our five to seven this afternoon. Hi advent expect boys. Dude. Hit the power line and he'll be out in sure. I'll pass a few more just in case you have spent some time about gettingcream together and getting them together. What do we call them? Take us to New York and inogi he's here, to get in touch with the mother after seeing the TV documentary living with Michael Jackson, the witch Jackson is accuser held hands and Jackson acknowledged letting children sleep in his bed. Palanca was called by the prosecution of support the charge that Jackson inspired to hold the family captive after the documentary on February 6, 2003 in order to get them to make a rebuttal video praising Jackson. On the way to stand, Palanca said that soon after she left the message with the boys grandparents, the mother called her and sat down and sounded frightened. Palanca. She was extremely agitated and she was almost whispering. This was fear-based education she'd be saying. The mother told her not to call back at the same number. The mother said, Palanca, quote, to the mother was saying, don't call me back here. They're listening to everything I say. These people are evil. I said, are the children in school? She said, no, that's when she started crying, Palanca said. She didn't say where the mother was at the time of the call. The comedian said you called her attorney after her because I felt they were being held against their will. How do you like that? Palanca said she met the family at a comedy camp for underprivileged youth run by the last factory, Club and Hollywood, and began helping them financially after the boy was diagnosed with cancer. Palanca said she gave the family 10 grand to cover expenses. It was fairly spontaneous. She said, I just decided on my own to do it. But she said she gave a second gift of 10 grand when the father asked for more money. Palanca said the father told her the family couldn't afford rent because his wife had spent their money on such things as prayer and a lot of statues and candles. Oh, no. But he will spend. In fact, maybe she can get that tea foul skill of before it's too late. Oh, look at this. Any place with the name like this can really be good. South Miami, the big cheese. That sounds like a step away from Chuck E. Cheese. I'm surprised we have an A vote for Chuck E. Cheese. The big cheese. I bet you're not going to get an A pizzas in there today, you know? Well, it's 11.20. I just had this sick feeling and it put a nice stomach that you would have to let you get left. Get a straw out. You didn't call them by. Did you call anywhere yesterday for the stakes? No, no. How did that happen? It was just a toilet. It was a spontaneous extension of love and kindness and decency and compassion and just chiming right in there with the theme of the show. Let's see, here's the facts from Rich Packard. See below for Rich Sanchez's sighting. Also, he says the best pizza Brooklyn boys in West Boca in the same place as the lights. What is this story? CNN seeing new ways to battle Fox News. Why are you sending them in this rich Packard? What is this thing about the rich Sanchez in it? Oh, God. Well, I said that because that's the pizza thing in it. Oh, by the way, for that fact, or call or whatever the hell it was. New York, I mean, pizza down here, they're from New Yorkers. Everybody's from New York, down here. Yes. So how can it be all bad pizza down here? They're on the Yorkers. You understand? The water isn't the same. That's why it's like the bread. There's there's a little great bread in South Florida because of the water. That's you two, Siow was here. You all know the website I checked it on half the time is wrong. But no seriously, that's why they can't make the dough. When you listen to me, they can't make the same kind of dough that they make in New York. That's, of course, New York is known for that great water, which is true from the Hudson River. I don't ask me why, but it's some of the best water in the country is right there. Okay. True. How can you make the dough without good water, man? Right? Water's water. Ah. Please. Well, you would need too much at the water place. That's right. There's beans or rotten your brain at your very flat. In a segment last Wednesday on the program, Paul's on now, Rick Sanchez, former local news anchor, a work for Mr. Cheatwood in my main joint CNN last year, Strap Thou a device known as a shock belt worn around the waist. It can deliver 50,000 volts of electricity to a person's body and then give a simple command do it. Moments later, Mr. Sanchez moaned audibly, crumbled of the floor on still patting after being helped to his feet reported, it hurts, it's painful, but no one's dead to which we say, dammit. Oh yeah, you're wrong. There's somebody dead, the guy you hit in the front of the stadium, he's still dead, Rick. Mr. Sanchez was attempting to show firsthand how a device like this shock belt might have prevented the courthouse rampage in Atlanta and which the judge and two others were killed by the rape suspect. The morning after his program was broadcast, they were euphoric. Mr. Klein, who are Mr. Klein. Who's Mr. Klein? CNN Hancho. Voise. Jonathan Klein, the new president of CNN. The morning after it was broadcast, Mr. Klein was euphoric. I thought it was great. He told several dozen producers that they're just gathered by video conference around the country for The Bregrated Reneine, a assignment meeting. Mr. Sanchez will join Anderson Cooper's A<|id|> News program on CNN early next month as the full-time correspondent. Oh my God. Yes, oh God, and they're right. CNN is becoming more like Fox every day. You don't get any news there trust me when I tell you. The best pizza in Florida pizza law and you notice we're not getting any place from Orlando No place from Tampa no place from Naples no place from anywhere We got Boka there from Rich Pactor and maybe one or two others Now that's it.

I don't know if you repeat for a lot decently the sobos is terrible bar the baker and the owner of Marla the baker he thinks this stuff don't think he is so good The death place and they're you're not down here If you get a humburdos of Papano man there from Long Island They've only been down here a couple years that pizza is through New York stop if you like me here It's the next the truth place, but pizza hut and Papa John's about that come on. You know, let's get real Yeah, exactly. I just got through saying that man This is starting to sound like that the Franco American and shiftway already all the way It did the general thing like that chronic facts are said Florida is a very B-ref Good great great pizza and sub sandwiches now. I will say you know a landing city subs and being a slaughter food But you know, it's it's good, but just suggest that that's anywhere like the hoogies or grinders Whatever you whatever you want to call them back up door. I mean, it's not in the same leaves man It's not even in Buffalo they had great sub sandwiches I mean, and you're gonna tell me You're not gonna tell me like what's the place for me subs? Yeah, no, you're not you're not gonna tell me that with a straight face. Sorry No, I mean If we have any part like minus of the okay I didn't say it was horrendous I didn't say it was puke inducing I just said to try to compare these so they don't know how to make a sub sandwich in soft food Okay, if you said hold your grinded it look you like that like that They start out here huh? They're not holding each other here. That's exactly my point, okay? I think you need to reinsert your view of your head screw on straight You're listening to Neil Rodgers massively you You're huffers over this performance by the dolphin Well Come Right surrounding your slam And more without a weapon, that'll stick you start taking him, as a hell of a chance. It's a shame to lie. They'll tell you, he loves you, but only because why it's very pleasant to know, he's with that a knife. That's what it's like if you are daring to go. God help you if you're daring to go. And then who do you go on? You're gone just like that. You're fairie. All the women say, Condits are clinton' protégé. If you rest down your name, it is little black. But they might pull you from the river on the end of a hook. Here's a jail life. They'll tell you, he loves you, but only because why it's very pleasant to go. Okay, so it was out of biography, gentlemen. You're a kind of a good guess, huh? Not a good guess. Anyway, another one, of course, he was a Democrat, but the same thing. All those finger pointing, goody-two shoes, conservative, whole year than that. I think he killed the bitch. And look at there. Look at this. He's got the Bible and his head. He's screaming and waiting and laughing. My tree shovel. In fact, he might say his Russian or himself and stick that shoe right back in there, whether she wants it or not. Now, here's, I just printed out, even though this website is wrong, about 50% of the time. Godfather's pizza. There's still around. They're all over the country. I think they're headquartered in Omaha, do you believe? Oh, wow. You're a good guess. Omaha's a fine. Don't you ever been Omaha? Yeah, right. Some of the best food in the US, a is in Omaha, Nebraska. Home of the College World Series. That's why I was there like four years in a row. Yeah, good food, but nothing to do, right? Wrong. Omaha's a fine town. Why, why do you say that? Have you ever been there? No. I would just figure. See, on your, on your punchout there, here's a classic example of two guys, or two guys' pizza. Two guys sit around, talking crap, and they know nothing about it. They would be like, my talking about, you know, Schuola's steakhouse. The only thing I know there that they had to make you want to football, then, you know, we learned that they have also a real menu. And that's all I know I know I know nothing about it. It may have, it may have the best damn food in the history of mankind. I don't know. And I'm honest about that. Really? But you're making your admit Omaha happens to be a fine town. And it's fine. I know you're thinking to Bible Belt, Midwest, is in Chicago, in the Midwest? Yeah, but that's like a major city. You're talking about it. I really good mid-west. You're not comparing Omaha to Chicago. No, but I'm just saying it's in, how far do you think Omaha is from most Chicago? About 30 minutes. Not all I've far. Right, but it's kind of like the country, you know? Have you ever been there? I just said no. The food is great. And then the people are, oh, corn fed. You know what I'm saying? Not only is the cattle corn fed, so are the people. I mean, you talk about a hearty bunch of looking fine men and women. Okay, let's get back to this, because you just lost. The classic combo is what Godfather is all about. This pie is pie number to wonder. I like to best the taco pie. Do you ever have, Godfather's taco pie? No. Oh, spicy taco sauce topped with beef, onions, lettuce, tomatoes, cheddar, mozzarella cheese, tomato, you need flavor. You're guaranteed to satisfy your craving. Oh, there's a button I want to press over here. The all-meed pies, piled so high would be pepperoni, sausage, and bacon bits. There's no one for any veggies. A pie loaded with beef, I ain't much of a lie. And cheddar cheese, topped with bacon bits and sliced pickles. Grins and flavor we call bacon. Oh, she's the pickles. Picles on a pizza and they've even heard of that. Grins and flavor we call bacon cheeseburger pie. Have you ever had the bacon cheeseburger pie? Once again, cock and trash, not having any idea. If you're not Godfather's man, you are really going to burn in hell. I'll tell you what. Are you going to meet your maker? Do fair right. I need it without the pickles. A pie of taco. You know what? Close your eyes and eat it. You can't put pickles on a pizza. If you like it hot, try a pie top of pepperoni, beef, and tattered sausage, jalapenos, and onions, and it's the hot stuff pie. Godfather's is so good that it's like a whole separate category. But, yeah, too good for Florida. That's why they got, you know, got to go to the Heskastation. Here's what it says. I have a one for the poll. Jeno is J.A. Y. N.O. Jeno is pizza on North 4401 in Fort Lauderdale. Jeno is never heard of it. Got it, J. No. What does J? No. You know what? Got it. Why do you still have revenge on the pickle? It's so. Recently discovered your mama's pizza. Oh, you mama in the falls and off the 120s. It's a street in a little strip mall. Best I've had in this town. Says this fancier. Your mama's pizza. Got it? Your mama. That's for you. Your mama's pizza. That's what it says in the falls area. This is a little bit too specific to be somebody making it up. And what do we care if it's for real? Not anywhere. Is this like for scientific purposes or something? No. It's to kill four hours for these poor people out there that are stuck in it. And the sewer of the universe where your fat ass governor is going to eat ballistic. And all these people. But I mean, I know what the bad of I will say is a body. These are the same people by the way that love camp. A little punishment. Here's one from Rick that says the best pizza I've ever had is from a hungry house. What? That's what Rick says. How does it? Well, then what is it? Schmirkling about. Hungry house might be spectacular. What do you again? Have you ever had pizza from hungry house? Of course I've had hungry house. You have? Yeah. And you're in so good. It's very greasy like just they don't get on there after they made the pizza. So another zero like it. Well, Rick likes it. So put it on there. Let's see whether you're out of line or whether maybe Rick is just full of it. Maybe he's hungry. Howie? Maybe he needs to have that shit. She needs to have some lunch. Next piece of the deer field beach across the city hall. Thin crushed near our style or a Sicilian style. Sicilian or Focacci style. Whole pies or by the slice. It says I get a huge slice with tomatoes on his garlic to die for. Next piece of deer field beach. Do you bad it? I got good. WDQA. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yes, I am. I got one in Hollywood. It's called Conquer de Europe. I'm big your pardon. The truck in the era in Hollywood. It's been a business for almost 40 years. Great. What's going on? How you spelling? See you in C.A. D.E. O.R. Mark of the euro. Okay. The order. Sounds great. Where is it again in Hollywood? It's in Hollywood. I'm Hollywood circle. Hollywood circle. What was that another one in Hollywood? I'm 441. You know the one in the arena. No, no. But what were they make the Thin Crush? Is it Rosie's roses? I don't remember. But we're talking about the other day on 441. Yeah. That Italian restaurant has been there for over 40 years. Yeah. That's an excellent Italian restaurant. Okay. Thanks a lot. See you. What's the one I'm thinking about where they make the Thin Crush that's highly overrated. I try to one time as it rose Mary's baby. Yeah rose Mary's baby. I think they're. In fact, you can still see the she's. She can not the door. Damn it. Well, I can't wait to see what's going on with Whitney's baby today on a passion since I see the day ahead of everybody else. The look on Eve's face when she angst that baby out. Oh, she's better wrapped up in a blanket. Oh, it's probably got six heads and 48 eyes. It's probably grow. Tensk anyway. Somebody who will rose is that. Maybe that's in Villa Rose. Some put it down yet. But that's the one. Some people actually like that. It was like charred. You know, on the bottom charred. But they do the word that we're in the brick oven. We have any calls about the brick oven. Anybody, uh, a faxes? No. That was pretty good. It was like at least an attempt to try to do like the real Italian thing because in Italy in a rich. Now they do have places where you get to six Sicilian. But the real real piece of it, just about everybody loves the most is the real super thin that they'd bake in the wood burning brick oven. A course in three minutes or a little bit less real super thin. And man, that is just to die for. 19 till noon at 2 a.m. Sure, it seems that real rancher is in the front of the sun. Oh, it's in the end. Well, all right, sports that out. Well, I just stayed up in it all. He's so safe. It was a big mistake. I think I have my cow disease. I explain in your life. Oh, my old rain is gone. It'll be the death of me. Four blind sponge, a former devil, a fateful face. I'm a little bit scared. But I'm a little bit scared. But I'm a little bit scared. But I'm a little bit scared. But I'm a little bit scared. But I'm a little bit scared. What I love never dies. Washington, the weather location of Santa ranch is large of lots of cities. I'm saying to you, don't be trying to take it, you'll be dying to take it, you'll be dying to take it, you'll be... You're not going to believe us, I got seven pages of Godfather's piece of locations in Florida. I don't believe you. How do you like that, huh? I cost to sure once again, the rest of the state, you know, maybe they're lacking in certain areas like mentality, but... Oh my God, how is this possible? Take a puke at this, even in storage and in Tampa. I'm just curious, I don't know, nobody would know this. What? Well, I've just curious if these are all in Florida, the ones that are like 92 stores in Florida. 92 count them. If they're all associated with his gas stations, like we have there, or whether they're like real Godfather's. You know what I'm saying? Like you'd list here, 20, 60, Davey Road and Davey. Now that's gotta be the his gas station. Also, Josh, who thinks he knows something, 41, 50 state roads seven and crawl springs. You following that? Sort of. But even if you're homework, Mr. You got a pizza there yet, by the way? No. Oh boy, that is really sad. I'm lost, of course I'm not there, so they don't really care about you guys. If I was there, we have pizzas piled up the ceiling. Oh, because, see me, like when a visit lake worth 3965 South Congress Avenue in Lake Worth, 5975 US highway, 441 in Lake Worth. In Miami, 188 north west 27th Avenue in Miami is not with June Road. Northwest. That's right at the road. 819, the southwest 40th street, that's bird road in Miami. All right? Yeah. Yeah. 7550 northwest 186 street in Miami. That bird road one, but that is a hesitation. See, that's one more freight up. 8300 West McNam Road in North Lauderdale. 114, no one busking, bulldozer by the north Miami. They must all be his gas station. They're all over the valley Orlando, Oviado, Palm Harbor. In Pembroke Pines, 1, 9600 Pines Boulevard in Pembroke Pines. There's a godfather. I mean, like that. St. Cloud St. Petersburg's steward Tampa, South Dale, Maybury, north Florida Avenue, north Hail, Maybury. Bruce B. Downs Boulevard. West Hillsborough Avenue. Put it all over the place over there. Not sure if they have been there. How come they got even in Val Rico. They got two in Val Rico in Venice in Venice. And then that's yet. They got one. 350 commercial court in Venice. West Palm Beach, 6840, Ocatobi Boulevard. So there's hope. There's hope for the human race as long as there's a godfather. Here's a fact from Dan who says Red Rock pizza in East Boca. Wood slash pull burning stove. Now that's the real thing. See, that's the MS, the authentic. All made fresh sauce, cheese imported from Italy. See, I don't care what anybody says, but you're never going to get a great pizza with sauce from a can. It says the best real Italian style been there bought it. David loved it. Thank you, Dan. I'm going to tell you stuff about it. I got a friend Jerry Anthony de Springs, who's beyond chronic says I would like to suggest Anthony's drive to read and beneath the springs for the best pizza full. It's a fine Italian restaurant that a great homemade pizza. I'm going to have a little sip. One of the problems with the best pizza full is and he's got a good point Jerry does. Most people order their pizzas delivered. The best pizzas are not delivered for a delivered pizza. For Papa John's overdomonos or pizza. Well, of course, for a great pizza, I go to Anthony's drive to read and beneath the spring. Jerry also says the first shaky pizza ever had was in Rochester, New York. I accidentally spent a weekend there in 67. Go back to your anytime soon. You won't like it. He made it then just wait. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, and he Verizon in singular robis line.

You get it on there. Thanks a lot. You got a Missola because she's on a little quirky about the bank. Huh? I'll look for it. The other. I thought she said Missola. No, that's an oil. It was one of the Italian restaurants. I know that. Here's a family. She said we spelled it wrong. Well, we don't spy if we're on any close Josh. Do we? No, never. Did you see that stupid asshole bitch get arrested for trying to take water in the Terry Shival? Don't these people know that putting water in a mouth would drown her? Yes, she can't swallow it. You idiots? Or it's a symbolic move. Oh, I see. Hahaha. Yeah. We're gonna feed you whether you want it. We're gonna grab your cue. And fill it up.

No, no, no real quick. 560, 560, pound 560 in the right and say, and this is kind of a pointless, you know, because after number one it's like way the battle is for a second place, right? I mean, we've made pizza loss so popular that they just, you know, Oh, I see the misbellic from that one. I'm going to start to say my other. Well, I just rate him out when you're pleased because it's getting really pondressed with his, you know, that fruity or thing. That was, that was all I needed. What? What? Not at all. Not at all. It might have to be the, the internet fairy. The internet fairy that types it on there certainly you didn't do it. Actually, right? It was you actually. Who's that? Oh, yeah, I did it.

Maybe I was there on an off day, okay? Maybe they just charred the bottom of my pizza because they don't like me. Or maybe it was just the who knows what it was, right? It's like the olive garden. If you want to find it, if it's really great, I go back several times. You know what I mean? Over and over again. It's going to be fine to get a great meal, right? Could it could be fabulous?

And people won't find they always stop and buy some rice and go to ground ground ground. We can hide cholesterol, we don't worry, no, we suck them down down down. I'm dying out of here, because we were four, four, four, and eight for the strike. You're correct. Because we were four, four, four, four, four, four, four. Okay, bandages is great in press pizza at Times Square Pizza. So these kind of U.S. went an Oakland Park Boulevard the best. Well, thanks, Bandah. Where's that one? It says, what's I fan to to me? Bandah. Okay, Bandah. Times Square Pizza, got it? Good. A Senator pushing a bill to keep Terry Shavowall. I've said today, he'd be the Senate's last attempt at the brain damage women's feeding Q, but re-inserted. I think like that. Senator Daniel Webster, I love his dictionary. What's scrambling to secure votes to pass the bill out with prohibit patients like Shavowall from being starved to death, and they didn't express their wish to die in writing. Whatever it is, today is it. He said. Webster needs at least two senators to change their position on his bill, which could be debated when a Senate begins their Wednesday session at 1pm, unless in an hour from now. I don't know, even if I have a majority vote said Webster, they're public in from winter garden. I bet you think I'd got fathers in winter garden. What do you think? Do you see those kids? I see those ones? They just see those kids right now. I see an end. Sitting arrested. On the moth of a scene, a moth in global news, I couldn't stand any more of it. Okay, I'll turn on now. Of appeal to the Supreme Court before it's on a clock. I see Joe John standing in front of the US Supreme Court building. Yeah, that's what I see now too. Oh. Anyway, now you see you're just trying to throw me off the trail here. I was looking up winter garden. Let's see. Look at that winter garden 137.07 West colonial drive in winter garden Florida. There is a godfather. There's one in winter park and there's even one in winter springs. Honey, like that. Right, right. We're going to have to get around the state. I'm going to have to come back and do a godfather state hop and tours. What I'm going to do. Love godfather. Anyway, if the Senate passes the bill, we have to take a second vote. We're going to turn to the president's approval immediately. We send to the state house. Otherwise, now it's going to have to wait until tomorrow to consider the measure. And if we wait till tomorrow, my god, we got to get that. You're making a Terry's thing, you know. God. Go away. No. No. No. You're right. But how about some lunch for Terry? Or are you for you guys? You call up yet? No. But why not? You're going to sit there and wait for pizza to show up. I'm telling you right now it's not going to happen. If it hasn't happened by now, it ain't coming. Well, I can't wait. I mean, I eat how eat when I got here this morning. Oh, I didn't tell me that. Well, you know. Hungry, how is? No. Just how is. Oh, I see. Maybe how is it come by because you ripped them in an air. So bad. No, sure. Hey, it's not so greasy after all. I'm going to be done just smear some in your face. Yeah, maybe it's not. Prove me wrong. Yeah, prove it more. Bring us them up pies by. I can't. Nothing. That's all right. When George is here on Friday, and I'm off on that. Then you get food all over the place. Because you're going to know you. It's coming. It's ribs and just tons of stuff. I just, I don't have to touch anymore, you know. I tried. How many QAM? Hello. Hey, now. Yes, sir. How are you? Pretty good. I've caught them up the feet. So you're probably going to have a weekly long. Next time. The hard rock is seen out. Oh, yeah. I swear, somebody off the half of the deep in their calm back. You know, they have to feed the place right there in the casino. The peanut. Yeah. I don't know what the price. But so I think rock casino we should put down this. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. It's got excellent pieces. I'm out of for a couple of. I'll take you word for it. I don't believe it. But I'll take you word for it. And I'm glad he called right now because it's a tremendous segue. He must be psychic or maybe he just needs a good physical after eating that place. The seminal tribe. This is the ultimate. This is the epitome of hypocrisy. This is the most incredible. I talked about with a hundred this morning when he was telling me that probably it's at least 50%. 50% wrong because it's off the internet. Remember that? Yeah. Why is he so stubborn about that? Roots, Christen. Why is that? What is the big deal with that? I mean, who really cares when he came right down? He's just adamant because that's the story he heard. I don't care if it's the story he heard. Concompted if he dreamed it if he like had a hallucination. If the Virgin Mary whispered it in his ear while he was eating lunch and rose a low-pizziness house. I don't care. But he is just whipped up into her frenzy about it. Guess what? How for? He just passed it by the panel. They said I was wrong which I admitted. And he goes wrong. The seminal tribe is still Governor Jim. Boce wants to negotiate an agreement to have full-fledged financial slot machines. You will lie, you phones, you best out of gross you. That is just absolutely unhonscionable is what it is. I mean, we know it was coming, but just to read this in print off the channel 10 website. It just makes me want a gag. I think we need a gag order. In fact, maybe that's any who needs this. Yeah, the seminal is good use it. I don't want to tell you where that could. Instead of a piece pipe. How about a good hero? Yeah, that would be good. What do you think? No, it would work. Maybe learn them that. Applicator tube that Russia is to use. The seminal tribe told our fat ass governor once in negotiate an agreement to have full-fledged traditional slot machines. These are the same people that spent almost six million dollars behind the guys of some Phoney group, no casinos in. You know, they don't want to know who the money was coming from. Back in November to lie and make everybody psychotic and hysterical. The world is going to come to an end as we know it. There's going to be crime. A soft floor is going to turn into a toilet. That too. Good old chief funder thought over there at the Asceminals. The tribe argues that it's in total of slots because voters stay wide and in Broward County have approved slot machines of four Broward trash in the Highlight Front Hans. You think we're going to serve on the servant Chinese at the front Hans? Oh yeah. Yeah, let's have some one time at the. The seminal tribe has electronic bingo machines and it's because he knows in coconut Creek, Hollywood, Fort Pierce, Brighton, Emokali and Tampa. Oh my God. There's lots. Make believe electronic bingo machines. Fony slot machines. The Micah Sukhi tribe, which has some of our casino wasted Miami, asked Bush that we getting to go chase me just a few days after voters they went from the ballot measure in November. With lost biggest types slots, the gambler plays against the house. With bingo type machines, the players at each machine play against each other. Adam and sales is one of our two good sales people. God, I'm a good guy. I mean we got trust, rat, or an atom. The rest of them, I wouldn't give you a nickel for the whole bunch of them put together. I mean, even anybody out is there a good guy, good guy? Huh? No. Right? Am I even anybody out? I don't know. If you have to think about it that long, the obvious answer is no. So anyway, Adam and sales were this more we're discussing. He was at the seminal last night. I was asking him how it is that thing. I still can't. And I'm not going to go there. I don't want to see it. I don't understand how you play bingo first. Like, try to bingo. If you have to do that between every play on the slot machine, I mean, it must take you like seven hours to like five. I guess you can't lose as much that way because you have to patch gear on to play bingo first before it can spin the freaking wheels. And I guess the wheels don't even spin anyway. Do they? I don't know. What the hell do you know? You got it. First of all, you don't play slot machines and number two needs to win or win anyway. Have you ever been there to the harbourack? Right. Of course. Well, what would you go there for if you're not going to play the slots? They don't have anything else. They got video poker and they got that. Or you'll walk right on through the casino and you're out in the paradise section and get a bunch of bars and good times. Oh, I see. It goes there to get a slice. What he goes there for. That's okay. He's young and full. He's eating 16 pounds of meat. Well, I mean, I don't play slot machines and the only other thing you can play is poker, which I'm not into. And even if I was you'd have to. You're not into poker. And then you hear Adam this morning. All the young guys are playing poker because they see celebrity poker on TV. And they're playing monkey scene monkey do so all the young guys out there playing poker. That's a thing to do. We're going to go out there. Very proud of them. But even if I wanted to play, you got to wait like my powers to get on. Yeah, you can't get near those tables. Can't get near them. So anyway, the seminals want slots for themselves. We want it. We want it. It's bad. It's evil. South Florida's a family style. This is a pile of crap. You don't want to remind me of what? In Vegas. Remember a few years ago they decided, well, we want more of a family in my jail. It's going to bring a lot more tourism. And we want people with kids and boy, they dropped that like a hot potato. Because people who can't go out there to carousel and booze it up and plunge their guts out. They're not interested in having a bunch of punky little kids running around. They're not interested in sanitizing the image. They want to be a little on the ronsy side if you've part my expression, right? Right. There you go. Who do I want to go? If you want to go to that go to Disney the world. Go to Disneyland. Or just go to hell. You know, get out of our face with that crap. All these good. I'm tired of any two shoes, man. Let's just have a face called pervert land for all of us. And not all the other goody two shoes people just go and hang out wherever they want to hang it out. Like Gary Condwood. Well, they're busy killing them. Jewish frauds. Lisa says, I'm a loyal female. Mr. listing online at work. Thanks Lisa. I would like you to please that Capone's Flickr Light in Hollywood. It's right on the intercostal. So you can have a nice view and I have great pizza. Thanks Lisa. Capone's Flickr Light. You got it? Sure. What does that mean? Sure. What does that mean? What does that mean? I don't really do. Do you think Lisa made it up? No, not at all. Then why do you say that? How do you know, have you ever been there? No. Same thing. First you knocked on the hall. Now he's knocking Capone's Flickr. I don't believe it comes in. I'll give you a watch for it, you know. And you probably hope so too. Pizza lost got any two of man. Nobody even close. Girl Jeff, you know. We had some good times with him, but that's in the past. He's history. And the fact that he didn't bring your food today. What does that tell you? Does that tell you all you need to know? He doesn't. He doesn't. What? You know, listening to you. Somebody would have, well, 95% of his clientele in there is our people, okay? Somebody would have gone in there and say, hey Jeff, need those who want to show on Pizza Day, you better get to know him and make a mens with him. At least bring him some food, right? Did he do it? No. Pizza Loft 82, Mary or the Baker 34. Well, it's Papa John's 27. And Kassola is 26. Pizza Hut 26. Pizza Hut is the best pizza in Florida. Oh my God. Go out of the call that they permit an vegetative state. I mean, they make their pizzas in a conveyor belt, okay? Just like Burger King makes their rubber burgers in a conveyor belt. Pizza Hut makes their pizzas on a conveyor belt. Am I right? You're right. Yes. Oh, what a thought. Even a Pope is teukin from the Surgeist, teukin in general. The Salvo's 25, because only 22, steaks in Orthodox Mimeys, 19. Salad. Dr. Lee, uh, Brock Salad. Frankie's 19, Pizza Time 19. Godfather's 17. Now we're talking, baby. The Godfather. Little Caesar's 16 and Tonyos 12. Good old Antonio. Mike's 11. Sparrows has got 11 and Tony's 10. Everybody else single-living is, I'm telling you how to call up Tony right now. That would be bad. Huh? We can rape about how good his stuff is. It really is. We're talking about how good he is. Huh? To do that without calling. What do you mean by that? It's so pretty. Call him up and have him bring in some food. So you can just sit there and rape about it in jewel and buy y'all. No? Okay, I'll do that at the break. I mean, in fact, that I have to like twist your arm. That goes to show you how you picked out yesterday. That was a disgusting performance. I don't think even I could have matched that. I thought it was a great one. You wouldn't match. Yeah. No, I could not. Eating two full steaks and in almost fry and a put-long sub. Oh my god. I'm sitting in the eel, Roger. Come on, Mike. I'm sitting in the eel. Mike. I'm sitting in the eel. Wow. This Paul Harvey. Stand by for you. On Colond and Lane. Jacksonville, Florida. Chuck Buick. Finally, gave up. Chuck enjoys marijuana. So he decided to accept Paul Harvey's suggestion. He gave up. He went to the thorny called me. He ordered a bang. There. Bong. That's a pipe used to smoke marijuana. I want you to hear this carefully because you're thinking about a Valentine's Day present. For somebody who loved very much. Coach, my mayor don't want a bang arrived Saturday and after I opened the box, I was in shock. My eyes were locked open wide. My whole house was now a concert hall. I went to the washroom and even from there it sounded like a real live lady singing right outside the door. Coach, with heat eating your ears, you're gouging out and tearing loose and pulling apart, melting air and tasting black. Your windpipe is closing and you've lost track of which way is out. There's a searing Emperor down your neck. You've got a search rescue ventilate. Somebody's sends to kittens. I'm listening to all of my old CDs again because I have never really heard them before. Now, for that Valentine's Day gift, it's not too early for you to choose a bomb. If you're anything that happy with it, I'll buy it back. To locate your nearest dealer, tell him on 100. Probably 10 at 5.6. WQA-M. You know that it's speaking in Jacksonville. Eight, seven, a godfather is in Jacksonville. Even in Braidenton, which is like mudwump bill, Braidin is a size of the beast's foot. There are three godfather. In fact, you said you live in Brandon? I did. Nine-fifteen Providence Road in Brandon. There's a godfather's Castle Berry, which is up in the Orlando where they used to have the track up there with it. And you have seven old rounds used to be a harness track up there with horse flies, the size of bowling balls. Castle Berry, they got two of them. I mean, it's just, there's something rotten and soundful to something really smells very bad. Well, I got something that's not rotten. What's that? You know, Frankie's pizza that's got 20 votes on the pole? Right. They're finna bring us a pizza. All right, I didn't have to call them. They called here. How you like that? We like it. We go out and baby. Back in the day, of course, we had like 45 pies out to the ceiling. Of course, back in I would be, we had floors right up the street. We had top of Johns up the street. A whole different, whole different ballgame. Cause always we had some cause always. Still haven't heard anymore about cause always. I guess, you know, that's from the past. I guess it's kind of pass a 560, pound five 60 and leave a rising. And the worst part of this thing with the seminal is that hard rock cafe as you know, like you said with the poker, you can't get near there. Adam was sending a favella park after way 30 minutes, about a half an hour. I've heard a man. Get your card. That's how I just jamming in there. No, I know friends that go and they have to go hours before just to put their name in. And, you know, like, they'll go do whatever. Come back. You legitimately got to wait like three or four hours to do one. Just to get on a table. And what about the slot machines? Oh, I don't know. Well, that's right. I forgot you and care about that. That's for little girls. There's a way for slots. No, there's a lot of slots. I'm sure they're open, you know. Not we'll fortune. Well, they ain't got that. And they say do. They do. Thunder Hillbores man. I've seen their billboards when I was there. The big billboard wheel of torture. They got it. See, I'm going to tell you. I heard my story this morning about my day would buy me a suit. That's who it is. I should just a little bit. I don't want to make you lose all your money. Would you will? Look, because it happened to you. It can happen to me. Well, and would it require any skill on my part? Well, slot machines don't require any skill. Exactly. It's the luck of the draw man. Lucky timing. I walked in there. There's one wheel of fortune machine open, which is the one that usually kills me. And I have a love hate relationship with that machine. I love it. It hates me. It has been months since I ever had did any good in that machine. And about a big man. Not one, but two nice jackpot. That's not like a pretty decent day. Three and a half hours. Very nice. Not bad. Look, I mean, if you want to, you know, just keep going or getting drunk. That's okay, too. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Yes, sir. A poppy's pizza in Latter Hill and sunrise is not on there. I don't know if you would use to live down there. I think, thank you. If you ever went down there. I heard that. I pop these. Pop these. There's a bottle of New York, I believe actually. I just want to update New York. I just want to update New York. What do you think? What do you think? I think it's a P.L.P.P.Y.F. Okay. A new one question for you. When they talk about aging beef, you know, when these real beef steakhouses, what is actually doing? What is the aging process like? You don't want to know. Believe me. Is it like bacteria stuff like that? You don't want to know. You want to see it. You want to smell it. You want to be in those meat hangers. Believe you mean. Okay. Only Joe Pesci knows what a second said in that joint. Every time you question for him. What is it about New York pizza? They had a TV food network thing about best pizzas. And the United States and the United States and the United States and the United States and the New York pizza. They were talking about the dough and water they used to make the dough. And the water they used to make the dough. See? See? I know my craftman, it's the water. All right. Thanks. Love you. It's a water. It ought to be it. But that's the water. You said it. Oh, you know, there's another place where they make the Cossera's pizza. I'm an animal through civil business. They make the Cossera pizza. That place. It's in North Miami, Beach, Abelie. It's right there. Well, by the definition, causeway. 120 will it be. See? When you go away, when you're out of touch with reality, you're out of touch. Too bad. You know, Sarah's pizza. They may coat. Man, we can take it off if they're not there anymore. But that's really good stuff. Very, very, very good. And it doesn't make it like, you know, run to the throne every five minutes. That's a good thing. WKOM. Hello. Yes, sir. You know, you did get Godfather's pizza. Some of the head's gas stations. I've had stop in there a lot. You think they have a bag where I come from is right? They be good. They're good. And for good New York stuff, be to go down to old color road and call Uncle Franks. Uncle Franks. They have a pasta salad and pizza. Okay. Good day, man. YouTube, Kelly. Uncle Franks, you got it. They got anti pasta and anti-Christ. So you got Frankie's coming in. Let's hear it. You didn't even have to call us. You know, cause I mean, they would be bad. Have to call. I mean, we love that the bread over there. And they're very good to us at Tony's up on 441. 190. Third, whatever it is. But, you know, little Friday would be there. Maybe Frankie's going to turn out to be sensation. I want to be bringing it about 15, 20 pies for Joshua. You get me, you know. No, I just, I get one. I just ordered a large pepperoni. Yeah. So I'll be going to about a pizza. You're fair. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 6, and see anybody goes in gets drunk at the hard rock. What do you mean? There's a whole like outside of the market. The hard rock is up. It's similar to paradise. It's paradise. It's paradise. There's paradise. There's paradise. There's paradise. There's paradise. Insiders that are still prohibited by stick. So you got better. Can't worry about that right now. He's too busy. He tried to keep tearing alive. In fact, maybe the governor personally will reinsert that shoe before the day is out. Cause he's so whipped up into our friends. You're a fan of scum. No, he might get arrested if he goes there. Yeah, that's true. Hopefully. Hopefully. Wouldn't that be great. We have a party. We have pizzas for everybody. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. 5, 60, on a Verizon singular route of the line. I wonder if there's pizza and it'll rose a little bit. It was a little bit of a business. And I wasn't. Where was the deal of her house? I've been so many years. I forgot. Was it on a pizza?

I'm waiting lines. They have waiting lines like every day of the week and on Saturdays. You can't even get in the place. Thanks a lot, Pally. All right. Take care.
