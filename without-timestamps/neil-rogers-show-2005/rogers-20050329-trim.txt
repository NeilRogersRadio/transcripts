although it's pedophiles are going to stop going to Thailand pretty soon if they don't want to have the and maybe that's what maybe that's why it's going on there maybe God has good name there you are huh that's right that's what it is right maybe is going a little bit better he's going to show them a thing or a culture which is next among the findings as societies grow well the earth they ship priorities are maximizing income the maximizing well being that means individuals become likely to choose jobs based on how interesting the work is not simply how much it pays to the university Michigan political scientists Ronald Engelhardt chairman of the survey communities mean while growing more likely the sequestering for type the environment even if the measure they choose may slow economic expansion but this is too soon intellectual for me another key finding as they grow well for your societies become more tolerant of differences among members and as they become more insistent on personal freedom but certainly is not happening in the USA they're certainly not to many more personal freedom and are certainly not more tolerant other than that it's right on here's the life satisfaction happiness rankings i think i'll do it after the break we got the top few top five and they bottom five exclusively after years of drug abuse and controversial rehabilitation since boy

nail that sticks out will get pounded down responded maybe less likely to identify themselves is very happy or very unhappy they're kind of like comcee com sa consequently despite its tremendous wealth Japan ranks 40 second of 82 societies last among industrialized nations they're not happy there maybe because they're so damn many of me I think that might be it I could be in everything that

Now all the papers say. And now all the papers say. Jesse's got a love and child. You put the baby to me, yes. Well done, boys, papers. Me, I'm jammed. And you play, you play. Like it's spicy. Not for my, yeah. He's in trouble. It would say, oh, yeah. What happened? The big part of content's team. Yeah. And the movie was not a bad boy. It was not a bad boy. It was a bad boy. We just had you round. The old blockbets were these two-key girls. The two-key, expensive, and brand new chair-care. Maybe you get a little bit fat. And then they're moly gave her a word. So we constantly would have been in the queue on her. And it was something Jesse's got a love and child. Yeah. You're just gotta make sure you will don't force papers. Me, I'm jammed. Yeah. And you're on the road and wanky. He's like sister, I see. Not to mind her, yeah. And I ought to be the more money he's in trouble. And we'll see. Come on out. Yeah. You get someone that's very good money. A big part of content's team. Yeah. Give me a little fuck. I'm gonna be with this balance being you. Yeah. And what I can do is make this was not a milk industry. Yeah, come on. Give her somebody I read my money. So you know, it's back in the day when pedigual was doing some funny stuff. Yeah, remember those days. Yeah, that was a long time ago. It's 11.25. 60 WQA. And wait to hear this fast. We got man. It is incredible. Right on target. Two is matter. I think we ought to have people like marching and protesting outside the QM studios to make sure that Lenny Martinez has never put on the ear again. He's a good guy personally. Yeah. Okay. Here's the poll so far. Which of these applies to your morning listening habits? And of course morning could be spelled either way, with or without a you. For 113 votes. Since during like I listen to Hank, 103, the Humper. You want it? Thanks. And there are all of you. That was funny. Only listening to Neil on QM 90. Joe Rosen AM 53. So I speak in a little dog by about two to one. He's beaten a pants off of him. Listen to Stern on another station 34, which had better not be that beastly station. I'm going to like have a congressional investigation. This is because we get done with Bob Franken on CNN and Terry Shrivel and Jesse Jackson and Randall Terry. And of course the urban pact. What's his name? Mahoney. NPR and AM 31, including George. Are American the AM 31. Paul and Ron and AM 15. Well they like our material so much they want to hear it again. Since Stern left no QA, M and A, M 15. Oh, there's Jesse. Police sources tell me that his pants is advanced. As a sure them that he's not planning to try and get arrested. Not planning to trust us. And the strongest indication of that is he's going to be holding a new conference afterwards and making himself available to the media. Now of course all of this almost obscures the story here which is the story of a woman who is dying. Oh yeah okay. Let's see. Since Stern left no QA, M 15. Bob and Tom and AM 14 look how fast they're moving up. They're good. They're great. Don't listen to radio and AM 14. In fact let me ask you this. I don't want to go through it. You know I'm thinking. What do you think of it? I'm going to hang. What? Nothing. No cause Hank was kicking ass for all his years in the afternoon and doing great in Mad Dog and I had two to four slimes and if we had Bob and Tom and AM, see what I'm saying? Yeah it's been suggested before over the years. But then again what have they got to do with sports? You don't even have to talk about like when the Indy 500's going on. Oh the sports show. Go listen to radio and AM 14. I was listening to music radio and AM 12 and the big old. Finally got one and I was a sympathy book because I said somebody please vote for the big. And they did. Thank you. The big old thanks you. They make them feel like a real blood cast. Not as good as any of our test and spigas I had here's a fact this is one of the great facts we've ever gotten. You know the college generally speak in most of our crap but the facts is pretty good. What ever happened to our friend Lyle by the way? Remember he said he wasn't going to be a chronic. I don't know what he said. Oh please come on. He said he wasn't going to be a chronic. Oh probably the student name of the trees. And when you run vacation last week you should have seen somebody stuff that got through you know that I was being sent by my girl because you know he's unaware of most of the things that I've been saying. But yeah they didn't wait. That's why you say the facts are great. I said you want out of 10. No but they are great. You don't think so. The one on the 10 that I said you were great. I'm not talking about the garbage. No that's another good point. The facts you didn't pick into is through. I suppose it's the phone calls we got like you know actually. I think it's like a QA. Hello. Hey Niel. Yes sir. The thing about our shirt. I used to list the house sure not about big house. Turned fan. Right. You know. I would rather not listen to it. Or have it all chopped up like that. There's no way it was unlicinable. And the quote something from 90 more says. It was unpoignant. That they waited. Okay. Red dick call. Okay. Everybody's proud of not letting our taz. That's because he was a good sign. No. He was out with Curtis last night. 7 to 10 o'clock. Which is not really what you call. Pimo time listening time. But somebody must have been hearing it. And of course they're not too happy about it. I apologize for it. Our management forgave them father because they know not what they do. There's other good example. I mean, I came in yesterday afternoon to do something. I guess it checks something online. And I opened up the pod. As I'm in the habit of doing for getting course that. It was on. And I heard that that squeaking going on. And I thought what is that? How can that be? Right there in the middle of the night. You know, how can that sound? And by the way, he'll be on 7 to 10 tonight at Hollywood Dogtweller. It's his little warning. Curtis is on by himself for to seven. Mad dog will be back tomorrow for those who write this. Kagele down on your wrist like me in Momento. Now, here's a fact from Bob and Carl Springs proving what I'm saying. The facts is many of them are great. The ones that get here. He says, um, 52 years old or congratulations Bob. Your young pup compared to no fart like me. 52 years old. I've been listening to radio for 45 years. Look, yes, what Bob? I've been working in radio for 45 years. How do you like that? Oh, geez. I started waking up to her boss, Renneson on the AM Powerhouse 77 WABC in New York City. Hello again. Here's my best to you. Remember her boss, Renneson? Of course not. Yeah, but you heard some of them jingles. Yeah. I'll always WABC jingles. They were great man. It was the heyday of radio personality radio. And radio was really great when AM radio was something that people actually wanted. They coveted it. They loved it. They were part of their lives as opposed to just a bunch of static. Anyway, Bob says, because of business, I lived all over the country. I've been able to listen to some great personalities and markets like LA, Dallas, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington, D.C. New York City, and now Miami. Sure, folks like you, Hank, Mad Dog, Jaworz, etc. Our true professionalism. I'm sure if I broadcast a mistake to be a choice anywhere in the US. Hey, however, and of course Bob telling you something that we already know, but it needs to be said again, Bob. You're right. However, in general, the Miami for a lot of the radio market sucks. Absolutely correct. And in particular, W.Q.A.M. is unique. He says, sure, new up in numbers need a break. In the fact that folks like George and Curtis Stevens, son, are given an opportunity as great. Both have matured and grown in joy. But listen to. However, are your programmers deaf? Not listening or don't they give a shmit? As Bob, see even he's using my material. Last evening, I had to turn off Q.A.M. because of the Lennie Martez. Not because of Lennie Martez, but because of the, let like a thing. And I think he's got a point. Lennie is more like a thing than like a person. Does he have a speech impediment or his hands? He has a stroke. He is horrible and 100% unlicinable is what Bob says. 100% unlicinable. Man, oh man. He's enough to make you want to take the tube. Allowing him on the ear reticates any part of professionalism. W.Q.A. may be trying to obtain. Professionals like you, Hank, managed to do insist that he be removed and never a lot in the same room as a microphone is what he says. That's what Bob says in Karl Springs. I like that. Are we going to insist it? I mean keep in mind. So he's a long problem. Yeah. This is the same station that put the crow on the ear. Who is not only unlicinable but unliterate. I like that one. Yeah, unliterate. He just, uh... Everyone, everyone, manny, remiries. Right. I mean, makes for some comic relief. You know. What, what can I tell ya? We just got bad management man. We got mismanagement. You were a nice skirt, bad haircut. mismanagement. Just like we could do it. We said two weeks ago yesterday. Wasn't it two weeks? Time flies. What? Because you were there. When we had that episode. Oh yeah. Would Joyce and Dalham Clarence and a bunch of nervous Kelly have over the spherical people. That right there should tell you everything you know about the kind of outfit that we're working for. That's why you hear that kind of swirl on the ear. I mean, we got plenty of bodies around. Right? Yeah, we got bodies. No, no seriously. Like for example, Troy and then the beast on out of big beast fan quite frankly as far as on the ear. But he certainly is a hell of a lot better than a lady more taz or a evading. Huh? Yeah. You have to ask the management of our radio station Bob. Why it is that they put on people who on the very face of it are absolutely unlawful. Unqualified to be on the rear voices from a hell who make a sound like scratching the nose on a blackboard like that bit we got, you know. Right. That's enough by the way. I agree. That one. Maybe I'll even do it. All right. I'll pay to any more testing too. Whatever you're driving. Yeah. You're accusing me of picking on the Puerto Rican. Oh, a seat Puerto Rican? Yes, he is. Very dark. They have them there. I understand that. And so, and how about in Cuba they don't have dark hosting. You're a little bit. Are you picking on dark folks now again? Not me. Next thing you're going to be picking on the Reverend Jesse Jackson man and his love child. Team on you man. Team on you. Jeff, racist. Thanks to you. What are we going to do about those Americans by? Okay. Here's the deal. Which of these applies to your morning listening habits is a very, very important pull when a trend coming out Friday morning at 11 30 people are going to be listening all over town. Maybe 11 30 they're going to be glued in to five 60 W. Q. Q. A. M. They're going to be on top of it. They're going to be squeezing their radios because, you know, the the verdict is still out if we can make a comeback from Greg's idea if there was breakdown from our latest format change. One day it's for real and then it's a mole and then it's a joke and then it's a fraster and it's a tank and I mean, you know what it's like. This is like a radio mixed master right like a radio food processor like a live an audio processor. Huh? La machine. There was the careful. Oh man I feel so much. Oh, God. Third my son is not like crazy. Well, you ought to see the sunny shining. I bet you it's like maybe almost double digits already. Let me take a few can see how we're doing. Oh, it's 10. This is the first time this year. It's been in double digits in T.O. Oh, it's not a good point. I think the T.A. 10 against so it could be 15. They're going to be in the 60's already 50. Wow, that is fantastic. But are all these people screaming about? I'm feeling the area off prior to the start of the withdrawal. Well, I see. But it's a crazy adjuvener of since during life. I listen to that. Oh, look at that. It's way past time for the breakout. Get back to that after we're going to have so carried away with all this good stuff. That great fact. That was a good fast Bob. We like excellent facts. It's phone cost and you know, wait till we get on serious stormy. It calls from all over the country on our toll free line. Let's talk to somebody in avalanche and says, I feel just like Larry King. You know, old and hunchback. Right. Right. Oh, although I will not be wearing a bag. Now, isn't somebody tell us something about that? I forget exactly what they said. Larry and his bag? Yeah. We know that he wears the pants. Well, that's what it was about to do now. Listen, sitting in the green room during the show. We don't because we're going to bring a new box of depends on every hat during every break. That's bad. There's new young white changes. Then I'm sure. I see. Kind like Mrs. Wallace on a passion. Right. Who's that? Change your diapers. Now, the precious is gone. 14 passed 11 at 5. 60 W to QA.

It was Randall Terry by the way that noted terrorists. Yes, Terry. Yes, a veteran. Yeah, a terrorist. Anyway, I don't want to hear our Reverend Jesse Mason's sick. A former public school of fear who's been accused of plotting with a Brewer County man in the 90s to raise money. And he was the most extremist to fight in Bosnia. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. He was the only one who was killed by the police. And they have a start working on you next to us. He bought away a big good idea. You could afford losing out through two. Hoping to put questions about his motives and his vice-conditioned to rest Michael Schibel will have an autopsy performed on Terry after she dies. That is unless somebody's lunatics, the Schmittes' derbyes get that cue or insert it. His attorney said yesterday, Michael Schibel. He believes it's important to have the public know the full and massive extent of the damage to Mrs. Schibel's brain that occurred to the cardiac arrest in 1990. George Filo said, this surprise announcement clearly was made to combat persistent allegations that Michael Schibel tended to cremate his vice-body to destroy evidence of her medical condition. We didn't feel it was appropriate to talk about an autopsy pyrethamist's Shibel was death, but again because claims have been made by opponents of carrying out her wishes that there was some loaded behind the cremation of Mrs. Schibel. We felt it was necessary to make that an husband, Filo said. Filo's also disputed a suggestion earlier in the day by Terry Schibel's father, Bob Schindler, that she might be receiving an overdose of morphine to expedite the process to kill her. How do you like that? Yeah. Filo said, Terry Schibel, who spent 11th day without food or water yesterday, and twice received five milligrams of the pain killer over the past few days. The lowest dose available. We're not going to do anything that he's not postponed and natural deaths in my vell. Spokesman for what side hospice. We're saying last night that sometimes they give morphine to the patient, you know, they have no feeling. Just to pacify the relatives, you know, make them feel better about it. Just so they sure that his re-know pain. Oh, look at that. Interrupting Jesse Jackson boy, you grandstander you. Victims of yesterday's earthquake and how do you like that? There he is. Man, somebody ought to pull up to him. Wow. How's said for the world? The major. You know, see he's got an amnesia. He just finally admitted with a problem is. Huh, man. 560, 560. See, this is the turning of the season situation here. And I'm telling you right now, this whole scratchy throw thing. That's what this is all about. So you know, one of two different ways, you know? Either I can adapt real fast or. I could be after like, oh, I'm no two, three months. Hey, so they ought to kiss the ground that Georgia stand by to fill in. Yeah, I mean, of course, two or three months and then all of a sudden it's that summer schedule. Oh, man. Wouldn't that be something? I've been taking a bunch of calls here right now, but there's only I only see one flash and on the board. 560, 560. 560 and he Verizon singular wireless line. Pretty sad. Pretty sad how the mighty of falling. You know, we're fine. How I'm Friday. WCWAM. Hello. Hey, there you go. He's back. That one call and I say one call no calls because that doesn't qualify as a real call. Just like when we started this morning with Prozac Ron, not a call on the board. I'll wait. I'm going to say, in fact, let's do the break and then we'll come back. You're going to take like 600 calls on the road. We'll see. We'll see. We'll listen to Neil Rogers. 4. 560. 4. 4. 4. I got your breath beautiful. Michael, I want you to answer as truthfully as you can. Stay your name for the record. Michael Jackson. What did you give the children that stayed with you at Neverland? Did we not know anything else? He didn't cut. If a boy wanted to sleep with you, I wouldn't have a problem with him. Have you had sexual relations before? Yes. Oh, with who? Allison, some duress and crocodiles and tigers and lions. Your accuser said he saw you naked. Did he see your private? Absolutely. This is very swollen. Very swollen. It'd be a mess. How often I hit it. Or how about this? Feeling dreaming. Not my devil. She took the dove. Does that eye on the one? But the kid is not my son. Yeah, it's all the 31. I don't want to say Jesse Jackson is a grandstander and opportunist. A charlotte and be able to say there are two big big stories. The media tells us there are two that were supposed to be very concerned about. Number one of course is Terry and she's dying over there. Number two is the Michael Jackson trial. Who's radio show was Michael on over the weekend? Remember, Jesse Jackson, the Reverend. Remember what Jesus said when two or more are gathered in my name. I shall be there with you. That's what, maybe Jesse, maybe the J.S. Stan's for Jesus and I just know. It's just that way. But with cameras. When two or more cameras are gathered together. And now he's right there with Randall Terry and a bunch of other. Oh, in Penelis Park doing this thing for Terry and it wouldn't let him inside. Do we say hello or goodbye or give her and over the weekend. They give her the last rice and put a little wine. Little drop of wine just a drop. Jesus, Jesus, right? Remember like Marlon said in Godfather, just a drop. I heard lips. Yeah, just a drop. Bad news from Iraq again. I thought everything was going well. We're far out of this. Prime Minister Ead, I'll now we walked out of a meeting of a wax parliament today. After angry scenes erupted with assembly members be rating sheight and critically. They're befitting to agree on a government. He walked out the speaker of parliament ordered journalists to leave and declare the meeting would be held in secret after politicians. One of the many leading member of a law is blocked denounced the Faded to reach agreement. Two months after the historic January 30. Not third man. Polls. Hitting of their second ever national assembly session today. Negotiator struck over the issue of bringing soon the Arabs in the government. A step official so-called 12 is soon led in Surgency. They got so-as of an air baby. This will be keeping in touch everything is hunky dory or is Bob Schuper would say, Ophi Doke. And the Oki for Oki Swamp. And you know since he did that I have not watched CBS even news. And I have really did once. Until he get his ass off of there I will not watch CBS evening news ever again. Huh. 519 votes on a poll which of these applies to morning listening habits. Since during left I listen to Hank 130. About 30 minutes. One three oh. I'll listen to Neil on QM 110. Joe Rosene M58.

And the big in A M has got three votes. He is really rock solid man out of 519. We can actually do a thousand of a day. We put our notes to the grindstone Josh. Should we bother? Oh sure. You know since the food stop coming in you're just like. I don't know if you'd like. Would you. Would you get to how he's. Yeah. But that's you know I'm not knocking how he's. How he's his great. We love them when we thank them for. But that's very pedestrian. I mean you know that's not a good way of putting you. You're on the same. All taken on the river I've been going to come on down. Are you begging for food now? No. Shameless. Next thing I know Hank's going to be telling me I was at Martin's state house. Yeah. There was Josh Cortison his girlfriend. You know. Right. And mom and Howard David was picking up the check. And yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I don't think what was going to be bonding with Josh Cortison any time soon. Well, I'll touch with just a lot of. In fact last week remember that we had when they had some technical problem. Not that we ever have any QAM. But the audio vault crash right before two o'clock. You don't know about this. Yeah. No. So Josh tells me, you know, play another bit. They can't play the music for Ken to do the music bed for me to do the. I'll play like we need them music bed. And so I played another bit. And then we're sitting here like kids 203 is 204. And then finally they come on without the music bed. And Emma was going on about oh, Curtis all Josh Cortison. I do was say go, just go ahead. Go. And somehow blaming Josh for the fact that they couldn't get their act together. They're too. To a clock working. Spectacular. Playing you. Playing anybody but him. All he had to do was come on in van for a couple minutes. But that would have been, you know, probably on this contract. Here's a fact from Pat and North Carolina. What I'd say about these facts is man, this is where it's at. Calls you've got to, you know, I'm just not in this big and for calls. I'm just can't handle it. That pull building stuff man. It really, they're the one thing about that retard. Oh guy man. He's right about that. Pull building blows. He's right. Yeah. I agree. Pat says. I've been listening for over 10 years. I recently moved because of work from West Palm Nelson. You on the internet. Thank God for the internet, Pat. Wait till we get on serious. I cannot get stranded morning due to the ultra conservative radio here in North Carolina. But Bob and Thomas here, they're great and they get my vote. Good choice. Afternoons, I listen to the love doctors, West Palm via the net. They do nothing but praise and mention great respect about you and your comments. It says I've never heard you mention them. Probably because clear channels. So I've never mentioned them because I never heard them. The love doctors. Have you? No. I've heard of them. But anyway, it says there's so many tar heal fans here. It's not so what that was a tar heal goes Spartans. It's bad. Nice gone, Pat. It's all way around. It's said the part about those. I don't know about them. And why? Why would they be talking about me? I guess they're in Palm Beach. I guess that makes sense. I've heard of them. Have you been hearing before? Have you heard about them? I've heard about them. I know that. We get that all the time. But what does that mean? It's like that guy in Orlando that loser really afternoon. Jim Phillips. Okay. All these Orlando people think that we care about radio in Orlando, which we don't. Oh, Jim Phillips always talks so highly about Jim Phillips is, you know, he is what he is. Little league man. Little league is a step away from like, letting our tears. WM. Hello. Hey, good morning. Neil. How are you doing? Okay, sir. I had a nine of a listen to your show until you guys got Howard on it. Now that Howard's gone, I listened to Howard, but as soon as he's off the Harris, which stuck over to you, I think he had a great show. Thank God for you, Palia. That's what we're hoping for, man. That we have a lot of off there from that judge. I just experiment. I'm going to start with the first station to get out of the West Palm, but I'm trying. But I'm going to put back to you guys. You got a great show. Thanks a lot, man. I haven't brought it there. I like that. There's one. We're going to audience slowly. No matter the time, maybe one at a time. So that's good. We got a stern person at Stucklandis. Because that stern experiment boy. I could write a book just about that part. Of course, if I wanted to write a�, I could write the net cycle of pedia. I could write a whole series of books about the QA experience from before we even started on the year about that studio that would be ready on December 30th. That wasn't going to be ready. And about that check that somebody had to write out of his personal account because corporate didn't understand to deal. Remember that? About the old J. Golf tournament. All of these things. Being stuck on your right now in a clock in the morning. All of these things, man. And we're still in here. You talk about a guy that succeeds in spite of himself. There is your close personal friend and general man, though. Okay, that's why I'm talking about right now. Okay, say anybody has any doubts? Great. Yeah, that's what I'm talking about. Great read. It's just, you know, every time you think that he got out real fast in the horseshoe fell out, it come to find out there was a spare in there. And it's just amazing to me. I've got to enter spurs these 500. Oh, and here's something pretty interesting and most people are in a wereo. You know, these good religious people that are all protesting outside there with the river and Jesse and everybody else and handled Terry that terrorists and that media hound to river and Pat Mahoney. As protests outside the hospice housing Terry Shival in her final days mounted last week, numerous newspaper reports many based on an AP account mentioned or quoted 10 year old Joshua health-rath and or his father Scott Heldrath. Joshua's one of several youngsters arrested for crossing police lines in Penelas Park and an effort to take water to Shival. Another of the stories revealed that Scott Heldrath, a religious activist and anti-abortion crusader, is a registered sex offender in Florida until the Charlotte Observer mentioned it on Sunday. A widely published AP story on Sunday by Alan G. Green had a mother and a half-and-a-bobby Green and painted a war or picture of the hell. Ritz knows that it was young Josh who insisted it as father taken to the protest from their home in North Carolina, not the other way around. God's with me Josh said, The article continued, Scott Heldrath, a veteran of the Operation Rescue and Operations Save American campaigns against abortion, didn't intend to join his fight until a son asked to be brought to Penelas Park. My wife and I, we felt like if God really put it on his heart, we should come down to allow him to live out what God had put on his heart, said, Heldrath, a carpenter. Oh, just like Jesus. Yes, he. The story said, and just like Karen and Richard, the story said, some of the children at the protest carried signs accusing Terry Shabo's husband of murdering her and urging that he be sent to jail. The Charlotte of service to a hover revealed that Heldrath had plead guilty to sexual battery was in jail for parts of 92 and 93 according to court records and served time on probation. The former Naperville Florida resident remains listed on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Sex Offender Registry of the Observer reported, but he's not registered on North Carolina's. The NC equivalent applies to a Fenders convicted after January 1, 96. According to the story, Heldrath claimed that his religious police came to him while in jail. What a novel concept, didn't it? He found the Lord in a slimer before then he said, I basically agreed with everyone trying to kill Terry Shabo. Then he said he accepted Christ and turned his life around. Now he declined to discuss specifics of the incident that led to his jail time, but online research showed that Heldrath was arrested after an incident at Ohio University and charged with two counts of rape and one kind of kidnapping. Other than that, he's just a wonderful guy. Did you get that? Two counts. I agree. And one kind of kidnapping, I wonder if. Right. But he went in a slimer and he found the Lord. He found Jesus in there. And he got out his nails and his hammer. Probably killed a big cross there over the weekend when you think I'm not sure if we can. Then he tore it and tore it and tore it and tore it and tore it and tore it and tore it. Look at him. I don't know. Yeah, these are all these. And the fact that Jesse Jackson is there with Randall Terry, if you look up the terms sell out in the dictionary, there is this is push right there. Sure. It's a new story to you. You also could have seen a funny, grave robber in you. It's Ali. Ali dated. Coming up tonight, uninsied behind the true Hollywood celebrity music biography profile story. They came from Australia with a dream and the name of a road improvement sign. They were men at work. Why? Why? What album? And they were finished. Why? Men at work, lead singer, Colin Hay.

That's what I was thinking. Yeah. So that's like a compliment. Do not go to upstate. Don't waste your time. I won't. Oh, but new year from Rochester in the summer time when the Lalaxturati has real pretty there for about five days. That's the summer. In fact, they had to pull the cue on it on all upstate New York.

We've got to shout out of the 1000 by to, of course, see what I'm doing now is I'm playing like fast and loose. You've got to check our website early in the morning because I like to flip the next or one in there and intermediate one. Right. That's a change in the pole. Thanks a lot, Eric. By the way, forgive me to power to change the pole there. That's so really good. He got to put your mark. Plus, no, seriously, then he doesn't have to sit up there. I'm waiting and waiting. You know, he's got important fish to fry up there and eat fish. Now, that's not fatening enough for him. In fact, he's probably the burger team to get that new breakfast sausage thing I was talking about yesterday. What? And then one way six pounds of that omelet which, you know, omelet and toast and juice and what time are they on? 600, 8 votes. Since during life, I listen to Hank. 142. Thank God. Stop it.

We need to start the tournament. I already saved you. You're right. I succeeded, I can'tatisfow you. You're going. You're wasting your faith, you're my son. I need to be help. I'm sure like when you're going because the grandstandard dotter does that. You gotta. Just a kick eyeo touch. That's right. follow-up thing. Right now on CNN they just had a little blurb right before that guy called. I saw that just now but I mean you saw before when it got called in about it. There was also on CNN. Yes. Well, what tell the day now? So why did you agree that it was a heart attack? He's back in a hospital. He's not known. Just said it. He is in the hospital. Well, maybe they're sticking the tube back in the spot. That could be it. It could be like a section. Yeah, that could be it. Or it could be like the like Oda. Wouldn't that be something? Very follow-up would die today. Wouldn't that be, that would make my whole day? They say it doesn't lie but does that mean that it tells the truth? The public sees fleeting video tape images at Terry Shabo appearing too many to turn toward her to the mother's voice and smile. They hear what sounds like moans and laughter. They watch her head move up and down, seemingly following the progress of a brightly colored Mickey Mouse balloon. And often they ask, how could anyone conclude, but that she is aware of her surroundings? The answer lies not so much within Shabo's brain as in the minds of those who observe her. As social beings humans are hardwired to examine others face for clues to what the person behind it is sticking. They naturally associate vocal tones with specific moods. They detect meaningful words in nonsense utterances. I can understand that because I've examined scores if not hundreds of people of this conditions says, Dr. Leon Procop, a professor of neurology at the University of South Florida, who has reviewed the brain damage wounds, cat scans. At first he says his natural emotional desire to be optimistic and hopeful, meeting interpret movements and facial expressions as purposeful, but after long experience Procop says, I came to realize that my emotional reaction was understandable as a human being, but was not an intellectual assessment. The public has only seen a tiny portion of more than four hours of video tape chattering the past seven years of litigation of whether to keep the 41-year-old woman on a feeding. Oops, on a feeding tube. Sorry. Even doctors who have agreed that she's in a persistent vegetative state of admitted to being swayed to fully briefly by the now familiar images that have been played and replayed on national TV over and over and over and over it. The right testimony at 2002 hearing court-appointed neurology is Paul Bambake-Tis and now is that seeing the video tapes of Shabbos mother kissing and speaking with her gave him positive first. Yes, that was a source of concern on my part. How does one interpret a situation like that? He said, even though is that he did track a Mickey Mouse balloon with her eyes in one clip. Oh, let's put that cue back in there. So we can drag this thing on for months now. When you think? Sure. 560, 560, 560, 560, on a Verizon singer wireless lines. You need to get those phones lit up like a Hanukkah bush baby because we've recently divided in port. This is like, you know, the crossroads which happened so many times on this show, which way to turn to the right to the left straight ahead down the road. 560, 560, 560, and he Verizon singular wireless law. Look at that line 7. Just very lonely. Tick, tick, tick. W to Q a M, hello. Q a M? Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Anyhow, you go on man. Listen. Okay. I was reason I called it because I wanted to make a point about something I haven't seen on any of its new channels. For this, it was this is that the reason the C's written winners have gone through these team measures that they've done for the last week. It only took us to find their guilt, their Catholic guilt of all the dead people that we've killed over there in Iraq basically. Yeah. And that's the only, you know, I mean, that's the only reason they're really doing it. It's a pattern. Most of the people who are there are people who aren't favorite capital punishment, who are in favor of the war and Iraq, who are in favor of killing anybody we don't like, who are favorite killing abortion doctors. But always, always air on the side of life. Exactly right. You get to George Bush, arrow, or satellite. I don't think they, you know what I mean? I know what you mean. Okay, Palai have a great day. You know what he means? I think we know what he means. What do you mean? I don't know. W to Q a M, hello. Q is it Q or is it Q? W to Q a M, hello. Yes, sir. How you doing Neil? Okay. Listen.

Whatever. House boards and punch boards. Whatever happens to Columbus. She's she's smuggling Terry's body out of the hospice right now is a matter of fact. Good luck to you, Palai. Thank you. Who can do a better job than Columbus? Oh, but the governor is a very righteous Catholic religious man. Yeah, right. With a business side of this functional family. Don't you're any more about the noelty? No. I wonder how she's doing. I don't know the nose nose. Let me to Q a M. Hello. Yeah, sir. You're a Yankee fan, never me. I'll call you. Yeah, I can.

I'll tell you that right now. That's a waiting to go in these days. And I was a top lot. Is it no change? No change at all. No. No change. I can get a chance play. I'm the sense you online at work. Yeah, we'll play some parts for online. Okay, pal. Yeah. It's talking about out of touch. Actually, I think right now. I'll play during the break. I'm too. This is all time safe. Talk about chronic the e-key pain. Do pair. Same. Six. we can't play the far one for obvious reasons. Can't play no far times, Yankee fan. Not if Joyce and the Fc, well, it has nothing to do with the Fc, see this answer to a Joyce. We've got this bitch over there on a West Coast, our corporate legal, depending on what corporate legal says about this and about our corporate legal era. Corporal legal, my ass. We got this bitch over there, we're no radio from a pop-up toaster, and she's deciding to make it up as she goes along. Well, you can't say this, and you can't do it. And of course, the reason we got into this pickle in the first place is because our program director operations manager between the two of them they haven't got a BB, much less than not. So as a result, they would ask her, they would go to her to see her counseling advice. And she's got absolutely no concept of what is permissible and what is not permissible on the broadcast airways. Yesterday, a week ago, so kissed two years ago, 100 years ago, she ain't got any idea. None. And so whenever it is you ask her, can we do this? The answer is always all the same. Always err on the side of Perinoid and hysteria. And knowing nothing, Joyce, you idiot. You quizzing, you simple didn't bitch you. By the way, Joyce, remember to start. We had about the finger when the chili was that last week? Yeah, I actually went to a Wendy's yesterday too. Oh my God. And they didn't think of that out. Definitely didn't get the chili, though. Oh good. You must add George. I'm going to keep ordering chili in the hopes. Riker, how are like, didn't if I could have called to riker, how are chili from now on it, Wendy's? The woman who gave Newman into the term of finger food after finding a piece of a human finger in a Wendy's chill last week says she has suffered severe distress after the incident. And now is considering a lawsuit. You go, girl. And I, y'all, the thought of, you know, just knowing that there was a human remain in my mouth. It is disgusting. It's tearing me apart inside. She said in an exclusive interview on ABC's Good Morning America, yesterday day. I, y'all, 39, a Las Vegas resident found the finger while eating at a Wendy's in San Jose, California last Tuesday. The finger was about one and a half inches long and is believed to be a woman's finger because it had a long groomed nail say officials. That's the fingernail officials. Authorities are coming in a fingerprint database to try to find the owner of the missing digit. Maybe they want to give it back. Analysts say that sales at the fast food chain have dropped since five weeks incident, a statement from Wendy's ABC news that the employee who prepared I, all those food had 10 years of experience at the restaurant and suffered no finger injury. Ha ha ha ha ha. Like he's going to stick his own finger in there, right? Right. Now you're on to that wasn't record how is finger in a fries. In fact, no employees at the restaurant suffered a hand or finger injury nor has the supply reported any injuries, which is required by a lot of new acquainted Wendy's. Wendy says it's cooperating fully with investigators, test our scheduled this week to learn among other things whether it was cooked in the chili or not. Wendy's continues to fully cooperate with local police and authorities to determine the source of the partial finger. It's important for us to find out the truth to the statement. But I am her attorney, Jeffrey Janoff says that that's not enough. I think that's a good start. He said about Wendy's statement about cooperating with other officials, but obviously something slipped through to put it lightly. Little play on words. There's something slipped through. And this is a strict liability type of case. It's a product liability case. And it can silver doesn't expect to find body parts in their food. Yeah, right. But when you're eating hot dog, you don't expect to find body parts in your dea. I thought that's what it's made out of. Right. That's my point. Like noses. Oh, here you go. The Reverend Jerry Falwell hospitalized today for an underscore's medical problem. Oh, right. I can tell you he's in the hospital and he is resting.

oh, oh, oh, oh, Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh the most incoherent butchard double talk which basically what he said is here I'm here he said I'm here because the cameras are rolling that's basically I'm not he's there yeah all in all well he's he's against Congress so he doesn't disagree with the majority of the people he's against Congress trying to override the court so he's very much against that but we got to help Terry and what we we need to do is crap policy for the future but we got to help Terry just a lot of double talk but it would put about give me some of that Reverend can't show some of that Reverend money that's my favorite line in that bit give me some right it's good buddy yeah oh sure is tax-free no less sure speaking a good Christians by the way with Terry Shavo is life-wain in the focus of this political and legal drama shifts back to another key figure and the most emotional and angry of cases and all this county circuit judge George Greer he's afforded jurist originally ruled five years ago that the brain damage job of who'd been a persistent vegetative state for 10 years had no hope for recovery in that her feeding tube could not be removed that could be removed and actually you know it's interesting and it's article something they left the word to out of there is that incredible or why that's must be symbolic had no hope for recovery in that her feeding tube be removed on Saturday was he who delivered what could be likely to find the ruling that Terry should be allowed to die against the wishes of her parents and majority of house and said members in a cadre of dedicated right to light activists how many of them were there not thirty man maybe forty Greer as a conservative a back to the republican and no grandstander one friend calls him a plotter the judge has such bad vision he has to memorize proclamation to care we'd anything further than a footer to away it he is very much in the sights of a sometimes violent movement who's most ardent followers have advocated an occasion carried out the murder of their opponents including abortion providers the judge in his family are now reportedly surrounded by armed guards here is married has two grown sons protestors of a period of his clear water home the FBI arrested North Carolina man claimed put a fifty thousand dollar bounty on the head of a judge in the case associated press said however official didn't end the judge but you can only imagine the county commission installed a special computer to handle the hundred thousand emails the court got over last to be supposing the judges rulings the tone is very hateful run steward a court spokesman told a press people claim to be Christian but the things they're wishing on people are not very Christian sounding how do you like that now the shot of not know judge Greer had a withdraw his membership in clear waters calvary back to church two years ago after the church paper printed stories attacking him more recently penellis voters received postcards asking them whether they suffer from voters or more for reelecting Greer other postcards accused him of judicial murder the judge is home address went up on the internet and dead flowers arrived at his door a friend wanted to go to lunch with Greer but reported that the body guards wouldn't let him go there are very few people shown that the world is stand up to rob power states in university law professor Michael Allen told the AP he is one this is simply a case of people not lacking his decision and the fact that a judge is standing up for this is quite important he said this weekend re-rejected arguments by Bob and Mary's Shival other names in Shriver Shindler Terry's parents that their daughter had tried to say I want to live but this where is this article from the village voice well they're probably a busy you know gay stuff yeah so stuff like that anyway uh judge Greer rejected arguments by the shindlers that their daughter had tried to say I want to live before feeding two was removed March 18 see I keep going off of that thing and then that comes back you they argue that she made sounds and wow when asked to repeat the phrase wow and that was that was coming from Orlando there was Eric doing that wow is that yeah something like that Greer was firm all the credible medical evidence this court is received over the last five years suggested Shival was not confidently aware he ruled in the past doctor said her audiences were involuntary minds consistent with those of someone in a vegetative state like Florida and formed their career had turned them out again Bob Shindler said sarcastically he did great surprise the shindlers of trying to get Greer thrown off the case but a failed that goes on and on about good death threats all of these very nice things from these good Christian people and there was just he jacked us in an hour go spend their side by each with Randall Terry that is and it's just unconscionable it's unbelievable is what it is or you know something so when you have no conscience yeah that's right you know things when you're just a rubbing a hormone you're like he is that's all he is just give me the money give me some whatever money tax free so Jerry Falwell maybe on a way out oh boy you know who done it died think he went he oh 20 six passed no what is this line along the name man before he never will be more Howard David time how is Troy Stratford doing by the way and think he's ever going to get any copy for any of his

since covert I saw a purple creature with a gaze on his head. It wasn't upside down dry. I know purple thinking, baby. All upside down dry. I know purple thinking. Upside down dry. I know purple thinking, baby. A, tell us, Elving. Where would just when I thought things couldnt get worse? I'm gonna see what's carryin' with a little person. How can they call this a children's show? I gotta be careful, but I have a brownie. He hasn't got a upside down dry. I know purple thinking, baby. I'm fathom, child, I know purple thinking. I don't want to train your bad. And purple thinking, you can see. Yeah, it's always happening. We're almost about frischkin' tightness, hard to believe. But on the tele-tovies, honey, is a TV screen. It's sad, purple. I think straight at me. That was low and annoying, too. The hole in her thing. Yeah, I bet you like that incident editing there. I was pretty good at that with the accident. Yeah. Of course you should. I know if you have a good memory, you can like, stick that in your purpose. But, number two, if we had somebody editing these things out and putting little things in there, we wouldn't have to do that instead on pins and needles. Brian, Delray, Dan, you know, that Tamarack Tom, I think I heard us from really fantastic puts. I'm asked if I could have deal with him. Is he in the Boba terms show? Yeah, Tamarack. No, he did. That's Vokobab, Vokobab and Tamarack Tom. And month after battling the Monio, the Reverend Jerry Falwell was hospitalized again and they for an understilers medical problem as ministry said. And in which we say, oh, yeah, hubman-draired man, I continue to the hospital. He's resting. That's all I know. I said Jessica Tucker of his ministry. I got a yacht. I got a yacht. It was a second-emission illizgrage general hospital this year. 13 days in February, early March. For a tiny, he was on a ventilator. Oh my God, honey, I liked that. Time to pull the cue. I remember in Falwell when I big fat posts. And Evan Sportspan followed him at the trip to Chat New Gautinese on Saturday from the third round of the NCAA Women's Basketball tournament. Oh, women's basketball, Liberty University seemed evidence posties and run in a 90 to 48 loss to top-see that LSU, 90 to 48. That's enough to make you pull a cue right there. He'd also been in the crowd March 22 when the Liberty Women meet the beat to Paul 88 79 in the second round in college part of Maryland. How do you like that? Too much money to run in basketball, Jerry. Two. That's the problem. Oh, I'm squeezing my kneecaps. I'm so excited about what it's about. What is it? What is it? I'm doing the rosary. All right, yeah. Yeah, let's give the last right. What do you say? No. No. 560, pound-five, 60, and even rising and singular. And of course, the media people, you media lunatics, every time any issue comes up like this, who do we always see the same old suspects? There is Jerry Fall while there's Jesse Jackson. And as if they have something to do with any of this, you know? Who cares what they have to say? It's so predictable anyway. Well, they're ethicists. No, they're not. They just wave robbers is what they are. They're just behind the roof and they want some of that Reverend Martin. Yeah. Give me some of that Reverend Money, baby. 560, 70, 560, pound-five, 60, and even rising and singular. And at one guy, who was a stern listener, who started listening to show one stern with on a station during those fateful months. And it's still listening. That was it. Now he's probably the only one. How many QAM hello? That's a familiar. How many QAM hello? Yes. Neil. Yes sir. I wonder if Congress really had to react together instead of trying to keep a shiver alive. Why don't they enact legislation so that human beings could be put down with the same mercy and kindness that you would have animal that has no quality of life? Oh, you think that's a new thing to do. You think that this country is going to tolerate that? You think an Asia, are you dreaming, man? Well, why does an animal treat a better than a human? Well the animal doesn't have a soul man, you see. Oh, what do you mean? In addition, which the animal can't speak to the animals, not making the decision. Okay. Thank you. Okay, you're welcome. Like I said, the animals are going to have a man who's going to hell. I mean, you know, I mean, make up whatever you want. It's all a polycrap anyway. However at that, how come you can have, like I had both my dogs put this leaf? Oh, you bastard you. Huh? Yeah. You know, the square that may horrible wicked grotesque painful death was that time. But America doesn't deal well with death. We're always in denial. Even though the religionists, which is most of America was there, life is just, you know, a polycrap. The good stuff comes after death, you know, like the Muslims with their seven virgin or all other garbage that's going on up there, down there, wherever they're going. Right? Absolutely. Now, nobody, do you say, nobody? No, nobody in Antwerp mine really believes that crap. So that even though, you know, for public consumption, they'll say all of these things. All of these things. The fact is that they know when push comes to shove, nobody in cool to heaven and go, you know, the soul ain't cool and up there, don't it? That's it. They put you in a box. Bye-bye. And that's the end. You live, you die, you're born, you live, you die. That's it. First simple. Is there anything complicated about that? No, not only the fairy tales that men have made up because most people are emotional cripples and they can't face death. Just like Friday when our numbers come out, we'll be, you know, big men about it. Right? Right? What else? We can handle it. I mean, we might whip a little bit and say, I'm dying out of the hand. But nevertheless, we know it's coming. Like, grow. Was it good? Yeah, that's right. Whoa. Like that. When I was number, if I, I bet you, there's going to be a lot of money and growing that building when they see those numbers come out Friday. Whoa. So, what it goes, you will reap what you have son. You will sow what you have and why did we reap? The judge in Michael Jackson, Chapel Station, Trail, rule yesterday. The prosecution may present testimony about past allegations against the ponster. Including five boys, including two who reached money, $1,000, still settlements with the singer. Superior Court Judge Rodney Herman Melville ruled after hearing arguments by D.A. Tom Stedon and vigorous opposition by the fence attorney Tom White here, Mr. Roe Jr. The judge said he would allow testimony about alleged sexual offenses and alleged kind of grooming or preparing a voice from a lost station. Like what that Jesus do? The prosecution had sought to introduce testimony about seven boys, but the judge declined to allow evidence about two. The judge said he would allow testimony by a 90 accused of who received $2.4 million a settlement from Jackson and testimony by that boy's mother. By the way, the 93 settlement, he paid 20 million. Were you aware that? Yes. Now, it's interesting how the family, because they don't want off that gravy train, the family has all rushed to his side now, like the Latoya for example. That damn sack, I can't stand it. Now, you must have that cart there because, you know, she already was on a couple of years ago when I was about to say, they all knew that he had those little boys near and she found all those canceled checks in his room, all these multi-million dollar payoffs he made to the family, so all these little kids he'd molested and she kept saying. The fence that I could, I could't stand it. Right. But now, she's singing a different tune and Janet's singing a different tune and daddy, old Schuillus Joe Jackson there, he's singing a different tune and mommy and what's the other are the brother that you ugly brother? Germaine, Germaine in the case. All singing a different tune because they don't want to lose that gravy train speaking of animals, man speaking of dogs, they don't want to lose that gravy train. He's the meal ticket. Right? Right. Although not so much no more, he told Jesse, though, they all are. Those lies are just ain't that broke, just a bunch of lies, just to discredit him, just like he did with all these black luminaries. I mean, when you think about black luminaries, don't you always think you don't think about Martin Luther King's Jr. or Nelson Mandela, people like that, or Barack Obama? You think of Michael Jackson, he's a real luminary. Right? Well, he compared himself with Nelson Mandela there. That is pretty. By the way, got that card. Oh, let's hear it. My mother is very much aware of all the children that were there, all the boys have stayed there. And she is the one who always said that Michael, excuse my expression, but he's a sagant, and she would say that damn sagant, I can't stand them. That damn sagant, I can't stand them. Just cut it out now. Maybe she said you're far away. Something like that, do you think? 20 to one. Just remember boys and girls, all your people out there, what you see is now what you get. It's all a, you know, it's done with mirrors. It's all a big dog and pony show, especially on television. Don't let me give it. Howard Beale was right, man. Now, if he had any truth, they'll probably any crap you want to hear. And they'll tell you what you ought to care about, what you ought to be with, if I'm in a war frenzy about, even though you couldn't give a flying crap about it. I couldn't care about Terry Shival. Less. I couldn't care. Less what they do. Take the tube, stick the tube, eat the tube, lick the tube. I don't care what they do, you know? In fact, remember the Howard Beale's speech when he went there, the same speech. Right? Well, you eat like a tube, you dress like a tube, you know? You eat something. I don't care. You really care? No, not at all. To go on on for 15 freaking years already. Let's abroad die already. They were only going to see her on my TV. Oh my God. And that one, that one, those tapes they're showing that one, they miss leaning, but they're all, they're older than the fuselage. They're four or five years old, those tapes.

Lord productivity on the job, more danger on the roads and a less vibrant sex life in eye-opening news survey show the fly-opening survey. A whopping 75% of the response to the national sleep foundation poll reports symptoms of sleep problems such as difficulty falling asleep, waking during the night, experiencing fatigue during waking hours or snoring. Oh, it must be talking about rimmer, snoring. Roughly, a fourth of respondents who have partners report that their sexual relationships have been hurt because they have been too sleepy. It's less often our lost interest in having sex because they were too tired. Dr. Neil B. K. B. Director of the Sleep Disorder Center at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and a spokesperson for the Sleep Foundation tells the early show Coincorranese Siler we're talking about people not taking up attention to the importance of sleep and so living on a daily basis is an a terribly sleep-to-private state and that sleep deprivation affects every aspect of the way we feel and the way we function. The poll shows respond to getting an average of 6.9 hours of notice how that number they used. It's not so helpful in me. I know why they put the dust in the room. And average of 6.9 hours of sleep per night many experts say it also they made minimum of 7 to 9 hours of sleep per night. People like Norse had problems and few think they actually have one of survey shows. And it goes down about this. Pretty boring when it came out down on it. Thought it was going to be something where because I started words section right away I thought, oh, there is something they can sink their teeth into. A real fly opener. But here's one. Gaze one is we are recognized Canadian merges. Two gay couples petition Israel Supreme Court today to over this is yesterday. To overruled a decision by the Interior Minister and recognized their 2003 Canadian merges and Israeli Ruminial Human Rights Group said. You have left of the Association of Civil Rights and Israel said the groups submitted the petitions of the have of Jose Ben Ari and Lauren Schumann and Joseph Barlev and Yauron Laughov who were married in Toronto in November 2003. Hey, let's send the petitions were submitted after the Interior Minister refused to recognize the couple's unions. In recent weeks we asked the Interior Minister to change the status of these people from single to merges. They refused to say merges between individuals with the same sex are not recognized in Israel. Oh, Interior Minister is spoke for the woman. So being had that acknowledges the couples had submitted written requests for the Ministry to recognize their merges. But said it was obligated to turn them down because his really law does not recognize same sex merges. This is a matter for the judicial authorities to take up a thought said if the law's changed them will recognize the merges. Let's say the petitions on behalf of the two gay couples were based on a Supreme Court to Zing from the 60s which obligated authorities to recognize the four merges between a Christian and a Jew, a Christian and a Christ killer. Tom mixed marriage and the court of the court of the court. The court ruled in an insistent marriage document issued by foreign countries had to be honored by Israeli authorities. He said adding that the same person and held in this case on March 11th for other gay Israeli couples married in Sir Monizum Canada. One of the couples, Etypinkist, 31 member of the Tel Aviv City Council and you have a rob 32 manager of a real estate company so they would fight that their marriage recognized in Israel. Etypinkist, let's say love that name, huh? Oh, yeah. So what you're supposed to? No, I'm not an homo, she's perfect, you're right. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 5, 6, 5, 6, and they've arrived in a single wireless line. Let's have a party, okay. Let's light a candle for Jerry Falwell. I got the man who delivered her by Jesus. Good. How many QA and hello? Four, four, five, five, five, five, five, five, six, and the Verizon and singular wireless line. Actually, as a matter of fact, we like to put you in the same sack with Jerry, okay? And then we'll just draw you a diaphragm. So everybody will know where to stick the tube. Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I think the bedtime stories are going to win out. Oh, just because we're looking at phone, man. Yeah, this is a very weak two-day, incredibly weak. Now, if we did, you know, like one of those things like Hank this morning about who do you hate, there would be no shortage of calls on that. Right? WDQA and hello. I'm going to, I got a question. Yes. How come these people, these religious people, are picking on the governor, they're picking on the president, but they're not picking on God. Couldn't God cure this woman? What do you mean they're picking on the governor and they're picking on the president? What does that mean? They're saying that the president should do more to stay safe, she'll try over, right? Yeah. They're saying that the governor should do more to stay carry, right? God, God. They're not getting mad at God. God, sir, not in God. God, I'm not going to do with this. Okay, this was a, this was a husband, okay, he's trying to cure it. That's what they're telling him. Oh, hey, hold on. Okay. That's the answer, pal. He answered with the elecitor not. Michael Stravo, he's a killer. He's murdering her. And of course, you're going to agree with all these other people. All these other heavins, infantels. And again, they picture a ran and they show it to you like, well, basically no comment. There's Jesse Jackson and Randall Terri reaches out, he grabs him by the arm and slaps him up to the podium and like they're almost harm and almost they think about to do something to them. I mean, just the concept of it is enough to make Hunter West Thompson like, boys brains out from what they think are ready yesterday. Of course, he was so sliced by that and sliced by that time with the president of make, right? Right. He's a state of mind. He's a rascal house. He's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's a, he's you way and hello. Hey, Neil, yes, sir.

He said that he don't bake for food like other DJs and then he says, well, that guy's all the way up in Canada. But at least he sees the crew. Yeah. So I guess that's what he was talking about. Oh, good. All thanks to the fire in port. We love your Ricky Tickie. Okay. We tip our camp to you. where one of those Ricky Tickie camps now like I'm right.

We'll have Boca Bryant bring you in a nice bedora. There you go. Let's see who's the fact that says I'm ready to agree with the Republicans if all well looks into a coma. Talk all kinds of tubes in every orifice and let him linger online. It says what's the difference he's been invincible for 71 years. That's pretty good point. Of course he's a vegetable he'll want to be lumped in with him fruits. You can you follow what I'm saying. You're very. Please. Welcome to QAM Hello. Hey Leo how's it going? Brother. All right, pal.
