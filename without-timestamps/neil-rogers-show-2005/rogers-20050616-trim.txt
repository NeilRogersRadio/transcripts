So what's going to get in the talk show business? Not him. Who's that? Clinton? Really? Bill Clinton? I didn't hear them. Historian New York Post today? Yeah. Says that according to Harry Thomason, he's been talking with clear channel about starting a new show. Great. And I guess it would go on after rush. Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. I sure hope he does a better number than Bill or Ryan doesn't this market that big. Oh, there you go. Clinton, interesting. He just had, he's made no impact on radio and software. He just even cracked the ear. I didn't even know he was on here. Yeah. There you go. He's as anybody else. I guess. But how do you think Clinton would be as a talk master? I don't know. It's just, uh, who knows. Yeah. Every member of Mario Cuomo tried it. Yeah. Most politicians. I mean, he's, you know, he's fascinating for a little while. But I just, I don't know. He's listening. I don't listen to talk shows myself. You know what? Clinton is a great interview. Yeah. Well, too bad. I think somebody great to interview him. The fact that, uh, that you're a great interview doesn't make you necessarily a great talk show guy. Right. But every time I've heard a interview he's brilliant. Yeah. I like when he gets PO that's a media. That's, that's my favorite. Yeah. I remember couple interviews he did. Yeah. I think with a British media and just, uh, went off the deep end. It was great. Yep. And then deservedly so. Especially when you see what we got now, what's going on in the world right now. And this guy was put through the ringer over a couple of, uh, you know what? Yeah. Let's get serious. We can't say that. No, we certainly cannot. We can't even say you know what. We can just say, that's it. So I can't even say the name of the place where they had the US open last year. Really? Yeah. Shinnon Joyce. Ooh. Oh. Oh, yeah. I heard that place. Yeah. Both parts. Well, I'm off for Louisville. We can and Louisville. Yeah. It's some Phantom Race that doesn't even exist. You're not full of us. I'm going to be tooling in nicely. I won't be because I'll be gambling this weekend. I'll be in Niagara Falls. Slight in the afternoon. I'll be at the Fallsview casino. Tundee Mike guts out all weekend. So I won't be able to. Obviously it's users in the end. I might have to tune in just to make sure you're on the air. That's not one of these Phantom Raceists. No, I'll be there. Our opponent may have some interest in. We got 200 votes out of already. What's your favorite former gambling? Uh, 52 people don't gamble. But again, that leaves 151 who do. That's a great question. What's your, well, somebody. Oh, a slots. Used to be horses as you know, but not even come out. And riders. Right. Not anymore. See, to me, the most boring. I mean, Thurber at Race in the Me is just coma inducing. I mean, it's a bit of a half hour between races and you risk read that form over and over. And you change your mind 15 times. And there's nothing going on. There's no horses warming up. There's nothing going on. Now you have a simultaneous thing. You got a race going every time. That's true. That's true. So that's that's, that's priced it up. And I think that's told you already before the show. I said, that's the only thing that's kept, Racing alive is the simultaneous thing. You know what I like about the track is. Some, some, it used to be. And I wonder if this has something to do with the fact that you no longer wrote that. Just to the lie that guys you hung out with a track or no longer here. They did. Yep. That's right. Oh, sure. Go into the track. For example, not fat rich died. So how often when I'm home to think I'm going to be going over to pump an O park. I mean, I'll go once in a while. Yeah. And you went with call. There are a lot to the right. That's correct. So that's part. Well, you know, that's what I've heard. That's a lot of the good. Your buddies. And it's like a day at the races. That's all. That's right. The gambling is like a secondary thing. That's why a lot of people play golf. They go out there with a few guys and they, you know, Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. You and more probably. We play a lot of golf together. I'll bet. Anyway, don't be fooled before Black Jack 37. Slots 22. Now, the person who sent this suggestion for this poll and said, show that charged courtesist finger to and take a poll on, you know, because Josh is very negative around slots. He thinks it's only for like pansies and all the ladies. Yeah. And I keep trying to. No, seriously, if he would go out. Well, he just he just got a close mind. I got to wood by it's astonishing how many young people there are. There are just all kinds of people. Young and old and ethnic and you name it. Gay. Slots 22. Poker 19. Sports betting 18. Cratch 11. Lotter. Lotter. 10. That's a good bet. Rue 10. Russian rule at nine. Question. What? I'll tell you, well, what the. I wish I could pick the nine in my audience who are playing Russian rule at kind of like fixed the gun ahead of time. I would like to send that game for the sales department. There you all. Please don't even start me with that. Horses nine. Cockfighting four. Highlight three. Dog racing two. Bridge one. Being going on and back. Rat none. How about sports betting 18. Okay. Just behind poker. But you see that. So horses and I mean, and then of course you look high line of dog racing. I mean, way though. I was told George before, but when I first came to town. High line and dog racing were huge. Remember when you stay on the mountain. These are the dog and both. High line and dog. You know, Christmas night was enormous. It might be high like a set. Yeah. They didn't run all year long. And the busking and flag with it. They have the mountain. They had a hit on the 70,000 and the afternoon. And they had over a million and night on a weekend. We had more than a million. I wasn't talking about that the other day. Yeah. The busking doing. Can it's good? Good. Yeah. But the days when he was out at the busking. That was a great time. Great. They're all right. It treated everybody great. It was terrific. I love this game. It was a fun. It was a fun friendly place. But it would be interested on the poker part of it to see how that broke down age wise. Because, you know, I just read a story and sports illustrated about how many young people are in the poker right now. Yeah. And if you're writing down further like the people of play that's not so video poker is huge now. Yep. I mean, people are watching poker on television. What about Texas Holvem? Is that like a, is that, is that, what is that? That's a, that's a form of poker. Right. It's a high-low game. It's a, and it or it's or you can play straight poker. And what channel can I watch that on? He has to be in the pool. Oh, no thanks. No. I was watching yesterday. They had a great match. Get out of here. You were watching poker. You know, you've turned that on. No, but by accident. And you get hooked watching it for a few minutes. Because it is so fascinating to watch the watching people play. Play cards to me is like watching other people play golf. No. You know what the ratings are? I know it's just shows you where we are. Reality programming and operator for Oprah. Yep. See what is that said. The fact that Scott ratings doesn't mean much to me. But that's what the young people are doing. No, man's car. All the people waiting for the big cray. See, now that's a different culture all together. I know it's out there. Oh, it's out there. All right. It's huge. It's something that doesn't affect me one way or another. But I know it's there. Me and the least. No, but it's just never took enough VC powders to be in the man's car. It's fun sitting there. You might as well to me. It's no different from getting a high rise over looking at 95. Yeah. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That's a good idea. You're going to see one. All right. I got to get a plane to catch. Oh, great. Well, listen. Have a great time in New York with his bogus race. What is it? Peter Stuyvesen. I'll say I'm not going to be in New York. It's Louisville. It's the Stephen Foster. Oh, the Stephen Foster is he a Stephen Foster. He would. Yep. And my old Kentucky home. I said you might explain it today. I think I would. I don't know they do it before the derby. Oh, they don't. Before this race. No. Well, what about Stephen Foster? Well, he wrote the song. I've been working on the railroad. That's why he's got this. For the song of the South. That's why he got it named after him. Well, I'll be there. And the race, too. Well, someday they can have the New Yorkers and the Hakele of the Memorial Race. Hope not too soon. There was a horse named Alan J. Finkelson. Yes. Yes. Yeah, you know. Okay. He's still running by the way. Well, listen. Enough of this race track. Catch your plane. I'll see you Monday. Don't lose too much. I'll try not to. Also. You hear Monday, right? Thank you, pardon? You're still here Monday. Absolutely not. Are you out of your mind? When do you leave? Today's tomorrow's by the beginning of the end. Tomorrow's the, uh, I got vacation and then I want to come back a week from next to day. Oh, okay. A week from next to day. I'll be here. Okay. Bye. Bye. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. I'll be here. Oh, wait a sec. We're recording a spot. Thank you. Yes. I'll get in with you. I know this is for sure. Thank you. There's a very disturbing, but you don't seem to be doing it, but you're already new that because of all the signals who are up so already, we haven't even officially started yet and we've already got technical issues, but that's okay because we're used to with many audience knows where they are, right? That's the station ID. Yeah. The station right here, all the ESCoodup stuff, that's WQAM, market down. Anyway, here's a thanks from Frank, so I guess we let the cat out of the bag right it on the pool, which is fine, because I think our handsome plungers are one out of the human on it. Frank says, I am nearly addicted to online casinos. We want to put that on there, online casinos, I guess so. Okay, online gaming is huge, yeah. In fact, if you are, oh brother, if you go online and type in slots and just do a Google it, the stuff that comes up and I've never checked them out because I know that's the last thing I want is to get involved already. Wow, holy. That the only thing is bad, well, I guess maybe not worse, but as bad will be left for me to sign up for this HMI, this source racing network. Long on this drop fire, this 7 to 1 shot leads by 3. So what I'm saying, I mean, somebody facts that stock market so I added that. Oh, stock market, that's gambling, where you could put it in a bad bed too. A fool in his money are soon forwarded. Anyway, French is nearly addicted to online casinos, the slots are awesome. I rarely can't shout in when I do, because you know, find some reason not to pay, but they're still pretty fun. Well, what is that? Because, you know, if this find some reason not to pay, great. Sign me your online. That's all. What is that all about? Frank, also I like betting baseball at online sports book. You can bet 10 bucks at a nine team parlay and is which is when is much as 15 grand. Pretty good odds of winning if you can pick nine positive odds. Well, that's great if you never collect Frank. So you know, that's fine. But when he says the casino finds some reason not to pay, that doesn't sound like my kind of gambling. Ha ha ha ha. Wow. Frank, get some help, Frank. Please, before it's too late. Check out that AGA, whatever it is. Best vacation city in the world, we asked that yesterday. I also noticed Adam didn't make his presence felt this morning before the show. That was pretty interesting considering we had an issue yesterday. And of course the operations manager was going in the hiding. And I understand, you know, see these people figure things just take their way through one more day after tomorrow. Beyond vacation for a week. Then we go into the summer schedule. I'll rarely be around to bother everybody. And that's fine, you know, that's okay. So what you want to look at it. Not to run. And really like doing your job. I understand. Best vacation city in the world is we had 244 votes. Pretty way down. We had that we're way off our feet yesterday. I think our technical property audio of all put us in a way funk around the moon in the world. It was funky. And then of course we had that big chunk first in the funk and then we lost that chunk at about 145. Although the Marlins kicked ass yesterday. Why did you get some nasty smelly Chicago Cabas? What was it? 15 to five? That's right. Wow. I saw that score and I thought, well, how do you like that? That'll teach them a thing or two. And what did I tell you? Comes one the night before 14. Nothing. What did I say? They're going to wish they saved a whole bunch of those runs. And they did not. Best vacation city in the world is I predicted and thanks to our show. Remember, it was Las Vegas 265. Speaking of the Josh court, as he got his flavor wave, we were cranked up last night. His flavor wave, Deluxe oven, and man loved it. Awesome. I told you, you'll never use that George Foreman thing again. We loved George Foreman a lot and he had a very fine product there. But you know, like everything else, you know. If anybody wants to buy my George Foreman. Yeah, put it on eBay. Tell him that the Virgin Mary wants popped up in it or some virgin. But at any rate, it's just things run their course, you know. But people actually use to listen to the radio. Wait. Oh, long time ago. This 265, Hot Lula 147, and today I'm 123. See you on the damn rack, eh? New York 119. Rome 102. That's my choice, boy. See, if you're going to pick just one city, you must go to Rome. Paris 76 Chicago 51, Floridaly 41. You can get on the train in an hour and a little over an hour. If it shows up on time and be influenced from Rome. Good for one day. London 39, no all means 33, butthalona 33, Boston had. But turn me out. Why do that guys? Just comments about Boston. He probably lost his asset suffoc downs. Victoria BC 26, San Diego 26, Nicanos 23, if you're into Greek. Madrid 22, LA 16, Seattle and Berlin 14th of Feast. Well, Berlin started making a move there. Colo and Germany 11 and Endora had nine. This is Endora's. Have it as daughter on the passenger's. Yes. Stores are Endora. I don't know if they start with a passion stuff. They don't be knocking at. He wait. He's finally found out that Beth took Marty and she's racing off to godly knows where. She's at the state line. Have they do these stuff on passions, baby? Tells people our eyes holes. They're so, so good going there. And just know how it is. They've ended it. We're going to have a little little union here. You feel the an eye. Please, they had a little problem with their scuyons. You'll feed it today. I think that the satellite fell down as something. Yeah, like a thought. I don't have you know my fucks of the lightfully fine. Thank you very much. Now if they don't mind, let's return to the same kitty's sport. How about a little touchy theory? Now see here. We're over here. Okay. Now see here. What the end. I want a sucker. Yeah, it's so stupid. I am so stupid like they say. I'm the official voice of the Pantsons. I don't know. Hey, deal. Why I'll have you know I made my bones when you were in embryo. How do you know? Well, it is. It's not my never told you. Yeah. How am I? I'm your father. I'm your father. I'm your father. I'm your father. I'm the embryo. I'm the embryo. I just come out of there. What up here? Let's reunite. What do you say? No. Sorry. You know what Gildy said about that? You went too happy about the idea. Softwater Real Estate investing somebody says, Here when he's got a little diagram, Pop has in the bubble bursting and there goes your money. Says, coming to a bubble near you soon. Well, just put real estate. What's wrong with that? I think we ought to like narrow this down. Since we want to get any calls on this today, which is fine. Video poker, we should put that on there. Even though it slots over into poker and slots, but video poker is enormously popular. Okay. Texas Hold'em. Which that's why it's tank. I don't even know what the letters are. It's a form of poker. It's a form of poker. So we should not put that on there. Very big now. Huge. Cumongus. We'll put it on there while you're at it. Well, so in other words, video poker, we don't want to put on either. No, put video poker on there. I mean, I put, you're not talking about online, right? You're talking about, like, the machines. Okay. I'll put it on. Right. I mean, it's slots, but then again, it's also, it's not the civic thing. Did we put online gaming? No, yeah. Yeah. And that's because all those people are still busy trying to collect. That was, that was disturbing to me. No, seriously. I mean, you have no way of knowing how to do it. Right. It's one thing we go under and buy, like, I don't know, a pair of gloves or something, or a hat online. And then, wow, you know, I'm really hoping that this is really whatever it is. So for a book from amazon.com. By the way, how's your movie coming, director? Oh, well, see that over. No, North by Northwest, it was backward. So it's, uh, sometime before the, in between, it's said between Alan's circus. I'm sure before I die, which I think circus is not October. I'm not really sure, but that's what they said. Some someday, I mean, Jack got his. He didn't like it unfortunately, but he got his. At least he's like a micro, not the micro of the flavor wave. Right. So one other two in bed. He's going to do it. And you're like, toss it. This is something you can use forever, never. And like he pointed out, the thing of it is he, the minute you turn it on, it's at the temperature, like it's, or nearly is 400 degrees. And it's 400 degrees right away. You'll have to preheat it and sit there and wait and wait. Or like with the oven. You know, you have to put it on preheat and then you set the timer for like ten minutes and you go with it. Is it, uh, is it doing it yet or what, you know, it makes your house all hot. Yeah, that's right. He's up to kitchen. Anyway, it's almost like doing a spot, but it's just such a good product. And now you see why we're so enthusiastic. Thank you. Again, welcome Josh. Thank you. Bob, my Romani kills five US Marines. This must be a mistake. More dead people in, uh, with there. Five US Marines were killed by a vomiramadi according to a US military source. The Marines decided the second Marine Division, uh, were killed today. Yesterday. Yesterday. When the roadside vomistor of vehicle during combat operation also, a US sailor died of wound suffered and he was hit by enemy small arms fire during combat operation in Ramadi. There is, uh, let's see, six, six more. The number of American troops killed since the Iraq War began. Now is 1713 and marching, nicely on the way toward 18 hundred. And of course, thousands and thousands, at least 12,000 injured and we don't really know the honest number. And over 100,000 dead Iraqis. But hey, things are going very well for you. I'm Sean and March. Chorthy. Yeah. You think we're going to get any calls today? Honest think is, I don't really care when we're dead. Especially since tomorrow is D-Day for me. Tomorrow is a major day in my life. Maybe it's D-Day. It is D-Day. Uh, maybe Duffel coming in like a paterson ahead tomorrow before the show because he certainly shine this this morning. Hoping that by tomorrow morning, I'll forget about, see, I think what he does not understand. Now that he's become, he's become the surrogate sales manager. He doesn't understand that. Because you mean there's not much to do with oxmanager. That's just kind of like a thing where they like shove you down after being a PD. Like kid curry, you know. But now he can be the surrogate sales manager because our sales manager is a voice and he didn't have the co-holms to come in and talk to any of us on a year. So instead he goes into hiding. So when it tenders in issue, we have to have somebody like verbalize and pretend really cares about it. And so Duff is the surrogate sales manager now and he's got it in a hiding. You're fairie. Maybe he's back there with a clearance. Maybe they're doing something. Not a clearance. Curtis and clearance. Maybe they haven't like a three way. W-W-A-N-Hello. W-W-A-N-Hello. W-W-A-N-Hello.

I'm going to need my right. You're not a-Well, why is that? There's no glucose. There's no sugar in there. It's got nothing to do with blood sugar. You know how you clog your arteries right now. What does that comment about my little tube and friend? What was that you hate him like poison? Just not a big fan. I just I like your show a lot better Right, not that better. I really don't that's okay. You don't have to like him. There's no lot of says you got to like him. Just pretend you're listening to me That's all I will feel thanks He doesn't like you, but it's not like he hates you. I find it his way there.

He said a crazy person As a matter of fact, I'll give you a PO box I haven't opened it yet But I'll go fuck, go make one And you can just send your money there Frank And I'll give you all I'll give you all the amusement you want Wow Now they keep banging away on this a rubble case I mean this This is just nauseating Because this is the way the media operates as you well know But here's the story Finally it says was race a factor in the rubble arrest That isn't even a story that I was looking for Sorry, let me look through my pile There was a story about why it is that there That's not the story You idiot, you simple to new You're fair right, that's me Oh here you go Well that ties right in with this The last people to see Natalie Hollower And I she disappeared in a rubble where the 188 son of a local judge in two middle-class young men Of surnames descent according to a local police Within days when Hollower was last seen in the early hours of May 30 About 30 men A rubble police arrested two black security guards who worked at the hotel Where she was staying One question swirling around the investigation was whether police initially Targeted the security guards who released without charges Eight day ladies as suspects at least in probably because of their race or class now Most of the missing adults strike by the FBI are men More than one and five of those abducted or kidnapped are black But you might not get that impression from the news media And some journalism watch dogs are not taking the industry to task for what they see as a Disproportment emphasis on cases in which white girls and women Overwhelmingly upper-middle class and attractive Disappear Sean Relievee anyone Television executive run away bride and mussees like low class and whatever Television executive so we see much of the criticism defend their coverage They stress that such cases as the recent disappearance in a rubble of 18-year-old Natalie Hollower of Alabama are extraordinary It would be news weather newsworthy no matter her better why is that extraordinary? What's extraordinary about it she told you she was white hot pretty right? Yeah, there you go from a white bread place. Well, that's extraordinary It says in the no critic denies that the Holloway case of the disappearances are rinsing for those involved But some insist that media attention on so few people overshadows them more than 100,000 active files on missing adults and children Currently tracked by the FBI I-I-I-I-I-I To be blunt blonde white chicks who go missing get covered and poor black Hispanic Other people are cover of a missing do not get covered Said Tom Rosensteel directed the Washington based project for excellence in journalism You're more likely to get covered if you're attracted than if you're not Well, who wants to go out and look at rugby people? I like way to get laid if you're attractive to watch a lot of look for ugly people They said during Mayning, President of Roberts, the major Institute for Journalism Education A group that works to improve diversity in newsrooms and news coverage in terms of giving citizens the information Amy I think we're failing because we're not giving an accurate portrayal of the world around them That's so little, little, little, little, little On its website the National Center for Missing adults for a thousand more than a thousand individuals including photos Physical descriptions short narratives of when they were last seen their young and old working class and professional of all ethnic backgrounds Most are average looking and most never even receive a mention in their local newspapers or TV broadcast Said Aaron Bruno, a case manager of the center who tries to interest media outlets and publicizing missing adults We want everybody to give coverage, but we don't get to make those choices said Bruno Who estimates that one of the five news releases she sends out each week gets media attention Of the nearly 47,600 active adult cases tracked by the FBI as of the beginning of May 53% were men 29% black about club percent of US population is black census data show About 62% of those missing are white pathetic and clues is panics Coding those FBI statistics is by saying 99% of the nations in the world are not at war So why are you focusing on a war, but a rack is an extraordinary event involving a merceness Mark Fron VP of news at MSNBC what makes news is the unexpected He said hallways disappearance during a shaperone trip is unusual and will be heavily covered by MSNBC regardless of agenda or ethnicity I hear a sound coming Chris the Robinson is folks of enforcing it and they certainly not news never said that a wide range of editorial considerations including Comfortation of rubber news events impact the attention given the potential story the race of ethnicity of a possible victim She said is not a factor. So in other words the fact that all these people are dying in a rack and all the merceness soldiers That said, all of this stuff is going on the fact that we ought to have an impeachment against this administration right now And so that's why we've heard about Rebecca a lot of dead Jennifer a Wilbank's right day after day after day after day They're run away bride God almighty I cried over the cover to the runaway bride. I'd give a good try. I was so upset But Rosensteel said that analysis of cable news in recent years shows an upward trajectory of the salacious crime story Including those missing white female such as Sean Relievey Lacey Peterson, Jonathan A. Ramsey and Elizabeth's not so smart Many consider women more sympathetic potential victims than men and white women even more so it's a crystal-brent zoope A professor at Columbia University is journalism school who wrote an article published in this month essence magazine about missing black women who are largely ignored Who's appealing who's sexy she asked who's you daddy the virginal pure blonde princess is missing and has a lot to do with class and sexuality and ageism Not just race if some old lady if some old babbage quiz missing out there is anybody here about her huh?

Oh, yeah E enormous humongous amounts of money are gamble every single day on golf That's why a lot of guys plays just it's something to bet on you know right want to bet no The secret British member of 2002 that reported that El Presidente was determined to go to war against Iraq months earlier than he publicly acknowledged We'll get its first official hearing today sort of in the closest version so far to a congressional hearing on the Downing Street memo Representative John Coniors of Michigan will head a former examining the document that will be followed by an internet organized rally in front of the White House Coniors pants to deliver the signatures of 105 congressional Democrats and more than a half a million citizens on petitions demanding a detailed response from the Bush administration to the memos allegations more than a half a million signatures. They got how do you like that you go John The memo minutes of a meeting that British Prime Minister Tony Blair had with AIDS on July 23rd 2002 And London said it seemed clear that Bush had made up his mind to take military action Bush has long said he didn't decide to go to war until shortly before the bombing began in March 2003 The memo also says that the Bush White House fixed intelligence data to justify the war Bush's prewar emphasis on the danger of Iraq's weapons Amazes destruction proved to be erroneous after inspectors failed to find any the memo came to light on May one and Sunday times of London So far in the US it's triggered more of a national side than a gas but news of its spread quickly on internet blogs Coniors said he's holding the hearing which will be televised on C-SPAN 3 to uncover whether there was a secret decision Well, how did the authority Congress have given an October 11, 2002 to Bush to launch the war Coniors said the memo suggested even as the Bush administration is assuring Congress They were secretly planning the war And it's bad enough that the Bush administration had sold little international support for the Iraqi war that their coalition of the willing met the US Britain and the equivalent of a child imaginary friends It's even maybe Captain Howdy was in there with us you think And who captain Howdy oh from after from the assassin are you eating again And it must be I bet it's how he's again We'll see even worse that is the downing stream memo confirms they had sold little evidence of real threats that they knew from the start They were going to have to manufacture excuses to go to war What's more damning still is that the effectively began this war even before the congressional vote With John Count Reckon is about to hold those hearings coverage of the downing stream memo is finally beginning to leak into the media Can we say leak it's finally beginning to be in the media in contrast We've heard almost nothing about the degree to which this administration began actively fighting the war in Iraq We're led in Vance of March 2003 official attack before both the October 2002 US congressional authorization and the November UN resolution Recording that Saddam Hussein opened the country up to inspectors. This is by Paul Rogat low Common street or common dreams.org got it. That's for that guy. I was saying yesterday. Well tell us where it's from common street a dreams.org He says I follow Iraq pretty closely, but was taken aback when Charlie Clements not head of the Unitarian Universal Service Committee Describe driving in a bag dead neighborhood six months before the war and a building would just explode hit by a missile from 30,000 feet What is that building Clements would ask oh that's a telephone exchange Played right a conference in Nevada's Nellus Air Force Base Clements her to US General boast that he began taking out assets that could help in resisting an invasion at least six months before war was declared Earlier this month Jeremy Skate Hill wrote a powerful piece on the nation's website describing a huge aerosolton September 2002 Approximately a hundred US and British planes flew from Kuwait into a wreck of airspace skate Hill rights and at least seven types of aircraft were part of this massive operation Including US F-15 strike Eagles and Ruler Force Tournament or Grout Attack Plains They dropped precision guided munitions on Saddam Hussein's major Western Air Defense facility clearing the path for special forces helicopters that lay in Waiten Jordan Earlier attacks have been carried out against Iraqi command and control centers radar detection systems revolutionary guard units communication centers and mobile air defense systems The Pentagon's goal was clear destroy a maximality to resist why are we talking about this is skate Hill points out this was a month before the congressional vote And two months before the UN resolution Supposedly part of enforcing no fly zones the bombings were actually systematic assaults on a mass capacity to defend itself the US had never declared war Worsh had no authorization not even a fig leaf he was simply attacking an abination because he decided to do so This preemptive war preempted our own Congress as well as international law. I don't think most Americans know these prewar attacks ever happened aside from those of Red Skate Hill's recent peace or here or hurt him on democracy now I recall no mainline media coverage at the time and little in the even in the alternative press the bombings that destroyed Iraq's air defenses were under the radar for both American media and the public If coverage of the Army's female continues to increase I suspect the administration will try to dismiss it as mere diplomatic talk just inside baseball But they weren't just manipulating intelligence so they could attack no matter how Saddam Hussein responded They weren't only grabbing would be allies in the participation They were fighting a war they planned long before they just didn't bother to tell the American public and again once again So I don't think a restaurant on T's got a summer at on it.

Albuquerque. I'm not an American. Where? In Mexico. Where? In Mexico. In Mexico. Yes. I was in Georgia. No, no, no, Mexico. Okay. I don't believe you. But you don't have to laugh, really. No. I want to get married. I really do. I was kicked out by aliens. I'm not a lady. I've got your hair. I can sure hear. I can. Who does? The aliens. I'm sure hear. You say you're hearing me like, right? I see. I'm a little longer than that. A little longer like Fabio. I never thought I could show them. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. I'm not a woman. Can you get me a scorpion? What? A scorpion. What? A scorpion. What? A blueberry wolf. I just think I'm not.

Anyway, if you're right killed, was there a sloth out of the courtroom on a structure? Did you see that? No, I didn't. I'm on a property. And if you're right killed, what is he 91? Something like that? Anyway, he looked okay to me. He just sit and up and there. Yeah, I slept a lot of there on a structure. It looks to me like they're just postponing the inevitable. Okay, and maybe he'll just cope first before they find the convicted. They find the convicted's an FBI or a clinic, a clean ass. Run away, Brian. Thanks, dear, with firm pitching movie. This is so disgusting. And it says officials are searched for her are not amused. Run away, Brian Jennifer Wilma, he's made a deal with a company that's pitching a movie about her life to networks, annoying the officials who spent thousands of dollars in countless hours searching for her ugly ass. Searching for her ugly BDI'd ass. Reagan Media, a New York that's Reagan Media, a New York multimedia company told the Atlanta urinal constitutes for a story today's newspapers. It's acquired all media rights to the life stories of Wilma and her fiance, John Mason. The company didn't say whether any money had changed hands. I'm looking forward to developing the scripted project with Wilma and Mason company President Judith Regan said this statement. There's an unexpected and compelling story of love and forgiveness that is certainly taught me a thing or two. Woo hoo hoo hoo. He's in how to make a quick buck. The 32-year-old Brian to be disappeared from her home in Atlanta, several of Duluth, April 26. Four days before her wedding in a ceremony with 600 guests and 20 attendance was scheduled. She took a bus to Vegas then to Albuquerque, Jerky New Mexico, and claimed he was abducted and sexually assaulted. She later recanted saying she fled because of unspecified personal issues. In other words, like that. He's like a funny, funny, funny, funny. Wilma has pleaded no contest earlier this month by making a false statement. It was sentenced to two years of probation in 120 hours of community service. She was also awarded a continued mental health treatment and pay the sheriff's office 2550 bucks. The Duluth spent nearly 43 grand a search for her. She has repaid so far $13,249. It's disturbing to me on a personal basis that she's willing to profit from this, but there's nothing I can do about it legally. She said when a county DA, Danny Porter, who preserves charges, presude charges against that bitch. I like that. That's enough to make you lose confidence and faith in life. That's enough to make you never want to read the freaking news again. The American freaking way. It's the American Joyce and Way, man. It's disgusting and nauseating. You go out and you do some disgusting, unacceptable, average kind of crap. You get everybody whipped up into her frenzy. You exploit the media for fun and whatever. And then you profit from it. So just like these jurors in a microjagion trial, all brother. Oh, we want to, that note. I wish I had to say that story so I could read the wording exactly again. They pass a note saying, we want to be left alone and we hope you'll respect our privacy. We did the best we could and we did our duty and yadda. And then all of a sudden, our later we see this room and all these chairs in and here they come. All of them. All of them. I really mean I want to be left alone. I don't want to be a public city. I want to be anonymous. No. I mean, what could be more anonymous than putting your face right out there on worldwide TV, huh? That's pretty freaking anonymous, right? And then all of a sudden we hear about, well, we already knew the 79 year old abroad. She's going to see right in the book. And then all of a sudden we find juror number one. He's on there. He's on my TV more than than, then, uh, then, uh, Arnold. He's on there more than jury's springer. All over the place. He's like, uh, what if I didn't call it when something like gets burn it burned in your TV, too? Remember that? Oh, right. It's still happens. Like the test pattern. He's the, when the old says back before you were born, the test pattern would get burn in. If you kept you said, I'm long time ago. Right. Get burned in your TV, too. And it was like always there in the back. And that's, that's what he was like the last two, three days. You remember one. The one that says, oh, well, I'm pretty sure he wants to blow a voice, but they didn't prove this one. And he's another one that wanted to be anonymous. And they're just all over the place. And of course, you know, and now they're saying, well, you know, some of these people might write some books and maybe a mini series and maybe a movie and a screen play, and it's set of and so on. Just, uh, man, makes you just weak. That's why I keep telling you folks, just enjoy your lives. Okay. Go to the track. Go to the casino. Plunge your guts up. Go on vacation. Go to any of those cities we had on our yesterday. Go to Geneva, New York. Go to a cataragus. So we're, go somewhere. Just have a good life. That's all because if you get, you know, it's like all the so-called. So, right stuff. Nobody cares. I said, who we these days, the Downing Street Memo, well, at least a half a minute people care enough to sign a John John Communist petition anyway. That's good. I go and John. There's a guy who cares. Remember him in, uh, for a night 9, 11, when he said, uh, Sit down, listen. They come as a surprise to you. We don't read any of these bills. And of course, they couldn't read the bills because the bills are on a big book that about 7,000 pages long in a big fat book. New York, Karen Stoke and Thomas, he's sitting over the big fat one. What? I can't say. Okay. Speaking of disturbing stories that just never end. Hopefully this will be the end, but I'm sure it won't. It's just will never end. Yesterday, we had the breakfast autopsy. Hopefully we thought the last chapter of Terry and her. That was it for guess what? No, no, no, no. Nothing's ever going to pacify these people. She could still, uh, you know, get better. They've got a long list of grievances, the shimlers. And what it's called? What? They have their life? The shimlers? Yeah. It's called. Chirlors list? No, Apollo crap. That's what I'm telling you. That's what it's called. Or to be more specific. It's called. Seven and a pack of life. That's what's called. I'm going to have to queue up. Throughout this trip, it was a rare��라고요. That the great aim. Each has ported capability.1870. The答ery on the opposite side by the extra ash, I got to now be quiet. are interacted with them and tried to speak. The returny said the family plans to discuss the autopsy with other medical experts and waited in her this and may take some unspecified legal action. We knew all along that Terry was profoundly brain damaged and Shavos brother Bobby Schindler. We simply wanted to bring her home and care for her and all goes back to this quality of life. Quality of life. Well, she didn't have any but don't confuse them with that. The findy's vindicated Shavos husband and his long and vitriolic battle with his inlaws that engulfed the courts Congress and the White House had divided the country. Michael Schibel and court appointed doctors have said she had no hope or recovery. She died in age 41. The autopsy also found no evidence that Terry Shibel was strangled or otherwise abused before 7 1990 collapse. Countering allegations by the Shindler that she was abused by her husband. The head medical examiner couldn't say for certain what cost her collapsed, long thought to have been brought on by an eating disorder. George Felo said to her for Michael Schibel said the findings back up their contents in the late years and years that Terry Shibel had no hope of recovery. He said Michael Schibel plans to release autopsy photos of her shrunken brain. Mr. Shibel has received so much criticism throughout this case. I'm certain there's a part in that was pleased to hear those results and the hard science behind him Felo said. The Shindler's father sent a law in court over their daughters' statement for nearly seven years battling to the end with conservative lunatic right-wing maniacs at their side including some clansmen and people like that. The autopsy counters a widely seen videotape. The Shindler's release of Shibel and her hospice bed. The video showed Shibel appearing to turn toward her mother's voice and smile. She mowed and laughed. Her head moved up and down and she seemed to follow the progress of a brightly colored Mickey Mouse balloon. Shibel's parents said that she shows she was aware of her surroundings, but Dr. Siddharg reactions were automatic responses and not evident of thought or consciousness. In fact, the one moment, the one time when I met her degree was when she looked up at the Mickey Mouse balloon and said, I swear. And that was it. So she said, There is nothing in this office. There is nothing in her autopsy report that says that in consistent with a persistent vegetative state speaking of the brains them said Dr. Stephen J. Nelson a medical examiner was systemally neurological portion of the autopsy. The cause of death was de-hagration from removal of the feeding tube, but the underlying reason for brain damage was official listed as undetermined. The autopsy included 274 external internal body images and exhaustive review of Shibel's medical records police reports and social services agency records, but the family says, Uh-uh, that's all just a pack of my right. She had been just fine. We took her all and just like how to wrap their in a corner. She had been fine as G.I. wine, right? You bet. Take it for a walk on a leash. 11 13 a Q.A.M. 20 comes to sports. 14. The assoring. 14. Sport where you'll buy a 16. New. Yeah. That's now.

And the ice that the week out there and I see those card tables. I mean, I guess there's sort of a sort of kind of poker, but they aren't really poker, you know, because they got their own table too, you know. Yeah. That's way beyond me, man.

When you think he would have sent us like a follow up fast to that, I'm a little bit disturbed about that thing and I'm going to break. Come on, Frank, you're with it. Business about every time I win because you know, hasn't excuse one up to pay me. What's that all about? Pretty sure I am, hello. I'm a big uncle. I'm getting me already doing. Yes sir, hi, don't. Yeah, I just heard you're going to talk earlier about the sloth. I'm the biggest every year. I just got back about a week ago and I'll tell you something. That we answered that wheel, it makes me excited. We went like three or four, they were just seen as I just can't believe they got the prices right now out there. They got ready to make us, let's make a deal, get ready. Now they're all still getting through all the little projects to be shown. I dream of a game. You couldn't get all that machine. If pretty ever gets kicked. I mean, a nickel slot, I do a gaming. But you know, people so don't think that people don't think that's a nickel slot, right? It's a bit expensive. Yeah. People like you can't afford a real phone unless the loss you have to make is coming back at a real phone because I'm really anxious to hear what you have to say around. Well, he had a bad phone. He lost his hands out there. You know how that goes. He's probably got two tomato soup cans, two Campbell soup cans and a tin wirestorm you have there. And then he doesn't want to blow off. Why? Who's saying he doesn't like to play the floss? That's not what he was saying. What I was not, he was not going to allow these stupid ass games. That's what he was saying. How do you know, see you're just like you're putting words in his mouth. Okay. That's not the way to go. Stay away from the phone. Go alone on your cell phone. Let him call them and speak for himself. Don't be trying to put words around. He's also not finding young man's mouth or old man or whatever he was. I couldn't tell it. I could go hear it there. Right. Then he can't hear it. Man. That's true. They got a slot machine now after every damn show. And of course, that's their challenge. They keep coming up with new and more interesting things to get people hooked on that stuff. That's what it's all about. And then you go in there and you pick your poison. And like I said, I see the same people playing the flaming. Sevens the same. Play the flaming. Sevens the same group of us who play Wheel of Fortune. I mean, we got like a little fraternity there. It's I see this, you'd be amazed. And some of these people who I know lose their ass on a very regular basis. Now, wondering myself, how can I slept or like that be showing up here all the time? And it probably thinking the same about me, you know. Maybe it's smart. We look at a little fart like him. But you're coming here all the time. Maybe that's why they're these lovers. Oh, Mr. Pension was there the other day. Oh, yeah. The other day. He's got a new horror story. I said, well, good. I just wanted to hear about it. Okay. The guy that shows up doesn't gamble anymore. And I might be once in a while. He pretends he doesn't. But he doesn't. He just hangs around and gives people advice and sits next to it. And he just holds seats for people. You know, you want to go take a leak and he's there. It's always a good woman. He just saved my seat. He's a sea warm. Yeah. That's a very, very strange. And I think you weigh in. And not there on five. Okay, our calls are running low. That's good. Because I like I totally have got a very heavy pile.

You guys spend all this time in your old pool hall. Bill here. Right. Should have passed. I don't know. They're making sense to me. People that I'm very good.

They got that chalk there. Doing the chalk thing. I played the, Bill here once upon a time, a little bit. I was in three bowling leagues. At least I had exercise anyway. That was the whole week. That was a matter of fact. And I was really bad at that moment. Well, that's there you go. WCWM, hello. Yeah, I know what I'm calling about the R. The Volk. Yes, Carlos, I'm a mobile, hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I was just calling the save of the R. I was thinking at the reason the online gaming probably has zero. It's because a lot of people would they do online and they would be able to call the R. The Volk. Yes, Carlos, I'm a mobile, hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I was just calling the save of the R. I was thinking at the reason the online gaming probably has zero. It's because a lot of people would they do online as you see the, the Volk or the sports betting. And I think that they probably call that for that. I see. Son of a, they didn't want to duplicate. Yeah, I think so. I think there's a lot of them that you talk to. They don't even go to the catheters, but they play a program line or they do the sports betting online. And I actually tried a little bit and we moved the program on my computer. Yeah, well, yeah, exactly. Wouldn't you be nervous about collecting a number one anything? I actually, on the sports betting, I did win a little bit and they did pay. It did pay. It took like two weeks to set me a, uh, a little bit. I felt like wire transfer check, but it didn't pay, but the on the poker. He lose what he quickly and. And you better get out. Amen. Good move.

During a January 2003 meeting involving Tophead and God Lawyer, where to hand another officials, the memo shows that more a warne that use of coercive techniques as military, legal and political implications, as international implications and explosives as to liability and criminal prosecution. Oh my god. More as deep concerns about interrogations that get more of the know, but it is not his warning that Tophead officials could go to prison. You're going down. In another meeting held March 8, 2003, the group of Tophead and God Lawyer concluded, according to the memo, we need a presidential letter approving the use of the controversial interrogation to cover those who have also maybe called upon to use them, no such letter was ever issued. Yesterday, the White House insisted that the tactics used to get them all are now and have been legal. All interrogation techniques that have been approved are lawful and consistent with our obligations, and said, White House press secretary Scott McCullan, whose famous of course for always pertinent out to the media. A pack of light. Another internal memo obtained by ABC News, a Navy South College is observing the interrogation and warned that the tactics used against Mohamed Al-Katani dubbed the 20th hijacker, revealed the tendency to become increasingly more aggressive without having a definite boundary. Secretary-istate Hermann Kering Rumsfeld said Tuesday that interrogating Al-Katani had produced results. Katani and other detainees have provided valuable information, including insights into well-cut planning for 9-11, including recruiting and logistics he said during a phoning news conference. Human rights lawyer say more was right to raise objections to what his appears were doing. It is clear that individuals of engagement, engaging abusive treatment of this nature, may be criminally liable for the Conitone Gagian said Deborah Pearlstein, directed the U.S. Law and Security Program at Human Rights First. So if I were one of the troops who was being asked to conduct interrogations using those techniques, I would certainly want to ask my lawyer whether you thought this was legal, should you say it? How do you like that? First, why do you attorneys out there and get about all you soldiers? You better get your unit attorney. And all you attorneys out there, are you ambulance cases? There's a whole new field for you right there, right? Get more money, get more rides and stuff. You have to count on a hop on a plane and fly to Cuba right away. Get over to get more. Or just get that guy for a lot of it. It'll crank up that DC3 again. You see the people in the hood are saying that they've been complaining about that plane law before a crash that was like overloaded all the time and re-auffin and puffin and truck and making enormous amounts of noise in the hood every time it took off. And they were like, all we've already, real whipped up into a frenzy for that crash. I just mentioned that. I mean, we're glad everybody still alive, but nevertheless, who's an accident? Nobody got hurt. There you go. What's your favorite form of gambling? I don't gamble 148 black check 87 poker 64, slots 52, sports betting 48, the lottery 41, crafts 32, horses have got, but third man, roulette 23, Russian roulette 21, keep going, y'all, but keep changing. You know, I was just thinking, the interesting thing about that, Miss Finn, is this. And that is that we do the screenless on here. He can get on any time he wants and does. And if he really had anything to say, I thought I was saying it, but the bottom line is, you don't have anything to say, wacko, not to say. So we can go all better shape about year to one, that doesn't want to momma momma on or I'm Hitler or whatever. But the fact that it is, that's all you do. You used to be the effort. He's really a step up and not sure too from her. But now he's like, hey, hey, and that's it. That's even, even Prozac Ron has got more material than you got. Right? The different line every time. That's right. We're almost starting to like him a little bit. Although he should not stop. But luckily, no. One thing we're writing in 19, stock market 16, video poker rate, drag rate. What is it dog racing? Eight. Drag racing to be good. Real Estate 7, Highlight 6, stock market 5, golf 4, spades 3. I smoothed their drives. You're all left to three. Online gameings got a pair. Well, let me give you a great website. Back a rat to bridge to Euchar 1, Bingo 1, and bidards just went on there. It's so far got to day. Oh, pool. Top of the old pool. WQA is real. Yes, sir. Did you hear about a story about the place? I think it's called the Southern Poverty Law Term Law Center. Law Center? Law Center? No. They haven't ever known the Southern Poverty Law Center. But what about them? OK, I heard something on their American sport. And that they made this issue to statement or something calling all these American families and family that labeling them as hate groups. Right. Which makes a lot of sense. Like, put a lot of time. I hope you're still focused on a family and all these other right. We've got these groups. That's right. I just wanted to turn anything about that or have any more information. Nobody I'll lend a dot check it out. All right. Thanks, Pally. I don't get it. What do you need? Doesn't the ambulance. What do you want to say? I thought he was done and they said, I don't gamble. They're good. Gamma is for suckers like me, angers, angers, angers, and anybody else. Right. Anybody know, anybody know? Nobody. Nobody. Don't gamble. Now, what you said? But I'd say, well, why is that? Are they cheap? Are they like, four? It says there's a do anything for them. Well, why not? It's like, you know, there are games that exist. I said, I mean, Amsterdam when he was offered me to the Coke and I said, not any. Why not? There's a world of games like Monopoly. You mentioned that this morning and everything. Oh, well, what kind of people play Monopoly? Children play Monopoly. Okay. There's else. Here's the point. Some games are fun for some people and others are not. And gambling is not fun for you. I know some games that are fun. Like what? You can't say. Gay. Ha ha ha ha. I mean, I only gamble when I'm in Vegas, really. You're a full of crap. You go over to the Indian's all the time. That's right. You don't, you won't go to gambling. You're just going to get leads for money. Go to pick up chicks. Go to the bar, hangs up. Let's go chicks. Vegas, what's the time anyway? What is it? I don't play Blackjack for like a couple hours. Hey, I would say that most of us who go to Vegas, we don't spend most of our time gambling. If you're going to do that, you're right. I don't know about that. People who gamble the whole time they're in Vegas, they want to play the owning Mahoney guy there. Like, we'll see more often. The Republican chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Challenge Time, which yesterday they have to find legal rights of terrorism, detainees and goodmowe, be known in what he called a crazy quilt system. Pentagon and law enforcement officials defend the current practices at the U.S. Military Prison Cannes. I've got, maybe that it's too hot to handle for Congress. Maybe that it's too complex to handle for Congress, or maybe that Congress wants to sit back as we customarily do. So, an Arlon Magic Bullets Spectre Republican, Pennsylvania, and he said as his pedal to testimony on practice in policies at Gitmo. But in any way, Congress has an activity said, the hearing came against a backdrop of going reports of U.S. abuse, Senator Patrick Lehi, a Vermont, the senior Democrat on the committee, called the prison and international investment to our nation, to our ideals, and remains a festering threat to our security. And of course he is, and they can't even go to a choice himself again. Remember that? Yeah, he did. That good, for and again, Christian, Dick Cheney, or Mormon, what is that? He's from Uh-huh, right at the raised from my home. I keep it in front of me. I know that. He's not from, he's from Wyoming. That's even worse. Yeah, it is. Speaking of even worse, and right wing fanatics, and board again, fundamentalist, way to hear this. I mean, it's not surprising, but it says very disturbing. In those groups that this other caller was talking about, too, calls back. They're all in here. Leaders of conservative Christian organizations plan a jointly interview with Republican contenders for the 2008 presidential nomination. Perhaps even endorsing more of them, steps that could expand. They're already considerable and scary political influence. We'd like to try to stay together, Tony Perkins, present the Uxious Family Research Council, said that they breakfast with the court as yesterday. The Adhok group includes free thinkers and strong personalities, he says, but they might unite behind a candidate who unquestionably best represented their views and priorities. God, if we could only bring Hitler back now. Gary Vauer, present of American values, said in the interview that the sit down sessions likely to begin after the 2006 midterm elections, would be a very effective way to nail down where people are on cultural issues, you know, like Fags, abortions, abortions, and Fags. He said candidates have become very anti-corrosive stem cell researchers. He said candidates have become very astounded answering written questionnaires and ways that avoid making firm commitments. Those of the plan to participate include leading figures of the Christian right. James Dawson of Hocus, Pocus focused on the family, Paul Warrick of the Free Congress Foundation, the Reverend Donald Wildman of the American Family Association, Perkins and Bower. Others would also join them, and we're not talking about Hank or Johnny Bower. We're not even talking about Papa Bower, or Bird Bower. Their groups would represent millions of social conservatives that have taken lead in lobbying to restrict abortion, band same-sex marriage, and confirm conservative, right-wing, fundamentalist, phonetical, fringe judges. Their top priority perkins said is winning confirmation conservative Supreme Court Justice. Evangelical Christians who overwhelmingly backed El Presidente in 2004 already had an influential constituency to Republican Party, Noshmett. Co-ordinated action could increase that influence, especially in the accredited GOP primary field. It wouldn't have an impact with Republican strategist, Charles, I'm not black-sett. But being seen as the candidate of a Christian right would be a very, very mixed blessing in the general election, says Stuart Rothenberg of the nonpartisan Rothenberg political report, a kindergarten model stamp is the candidate of labor in the 84 campaign. That would really pigeonholle a candidate, Rothenberg said. Perkins, both favorably of one likely Republican presidential contender, Senate majority leader Bill Fist of Tennessee, and dismissal be of another Arizona Senator John McCain who certainly not far-bist enough for them.

The article was too long to send. But the web address to it is below. And he's got a link here. She's written a book and CNN has an excerpt from it on the website. Of course. Of the excerpt is all about how she was mistreated by men in the workplace. What in doubt check it out? Thanks Ephraim. Zimbilis senior in junior.

That's good. How about Wanky? What's your favorite for? I'm not going to be the poor result. That was I'm tired of it. We got those. We got 20% of this audience don't gamble and we salute them. Okay. It's hard to make that money. Don't just give it away. Okay. A fool of his money are soon farted. Don't ever forget that. But I mean, if you just want to go for a little bit of recreation and tend to few thousand that around with that, right? Right. And then what Josh says, so you're not going to make this again. That's good. That's a good thing because if you did go out through you'd be tempted. You'd be plunging you'd be a, you know, because of my bad influence. You'd probably take a couple hundred and sit down there at the wheel of fortune and put it in there. And maybe hit like 3000 lines. You know, this is really good. Yeah. Probably looks at the black and that would be really bad. Unless you just quit right there. I know people like that who just. In fact, what you tell me about somebody? It just doesn't know how to quit. No, no. Somebody got lucky. Once they just walked away, and they never made another bed. Maybe the camp driver was telling me about that. Just woke away. Yeah. Who hit the 10 geez? That was right. One pull. One pull? That was good. What was he pulling? Deliver. I see. Are you serious? One pull. One 10 grand? 10 grand. Oh, I can't stand that. I mean, it's one thing to be lucky. That's disgusting. That is, yeah. Can't get dozing. So maybe whatever machine he hit it on, the person that was planned before was still around, you know, and maybe plunged their guts out through it. And he pulled all kinds of money and it is lost, and it's their way to see your friend come up and put in the problem. That's how it goes. Oh, my friend said that's a good machine. That was half of us. Two different times at the $5 wheeler force. And I have moved from one machine to another and had somebody sit down right next to me within like 60 seconds. Get a spin for five grand. Right next to me. How do you like that? I don't get up. I don't. Five six out of five 60. If it looked, it just happens. Case across a ride.

See you to the stand. I always had to feed the note was fixed. Well, I always did. I always did. I think it's better to be like that. I can think of it. I just always had to feed the note was rigged. I just, I don't know. Every time you start getting really hot and went in handy after you know, and they changed the dealer and it, a lot comes to somebody with like a Mark Decker or something. I don't know what it is. WQAM. Hello. This is my philosophy of strategy on flot machines. You play at the Indians for about three weeks. You have absolutely no chance of winning because they take out 50%. Okay. Good. Five six out of no five 60 pound five 60 in the Verizon and singular wireless lines. We knew I guess it's during the lunch hour. Maybe that's when these people were the same yesterday. Yeah. Well, when the people across the street, they might have nothing else to do. Maybe we could get some food. The food sent over there for them. So they could eat. Could afford to eat. And suppose to be calling us. That'd be a good idea. WQAM. Hello. QAM. Hello. Well, that sounds as silent. That's about the nicest sound. I've heard it a very long time in it. I mean, completely blind. Mm. WQAM. Hello. Hello. Yeah. WQAM. So they can eat. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah. You're absolutely right about the one arm man that's, I did the same thing on the yacht on the cruise ship. One woman with planes. You're the only one playing the one arm band that she got up and left. I went down sat down. Quarter. I was. I'm right. Nice gone. She went to the park. Can't really. Oh, she went to the manager. You're lucky. You're lucky. She's a boy. You're a friend. I split it with her. Yeah. Right. Oh, listen. There are people around. Because he knows by the way, who will pull that crap. Oh, yeah. There are all kinds of stuff that goes on. You want my machine. Okay. And then like a standard 50 minutes. You want like two or three grand. Okay. Well, how about 6,700? 6,700. You're a little bit less split something. Yeah. You're a brain. If you had one. You're mama. That's what I have for you. Your mom and I'll get lost. Get out of here. I didn't drag you out of the chair. You lose your piece of crap. You. WKOM. Hello. Any welcome. Yes. Watching the show intervention. People different. Yeah. David conclusion that gambling is the worst. Right. Only because like a few. An alcoholic or a crackhead or whatever. At least you're taking something physically into your body that you're addicted to. You can move that. You can get over it. But gambling. These degener gamblers will sit there and even if they win, they'll stay till they lose other money. It's that's why. Yeah. So now that it's all right. Well, it's like the guy in Oni Mahoney in that movie, which was a true story. He won a $1.9 million. He was 10 million in debt. He won 9 million on a really how wild night. And he lost every time of his back. Oh, it's the worst. And then on the show intervention. Did the gamblers were the only ones that didn't want help or if they did. They leave treatment after 5, 6 days. You're on the same ride. It's like it in the same movie. He keeps saying, why don't have a gambling problem. I have a financial problem. Yeah. It's just ridiculous. So in other words, he didn't have it. He just didn't have enough money to keep perpetuating his habit. I just always consider it the worst advice. I'm glad I don't gamble. But you know something. And you maybe inspired me to go out to wood by today. Thanks a lot, Fanny. Take it easy. I'm gamble for you. How's that? All right. I don't look at it as advice. It's like anything else. I mean, drinking isn't a vice unless you overdo it. And raising a vice unless you overdo it. That's what you have to do. That's not a vice unless you overdo it. Unless you're obsessed with it. And you said they're picking seeds out of your weed. Not of your wherever all day. It's like anything else in moderation. I squeeze the vice unless you overdo it. Correct. Correct. That's right. But like when you're eating two, three pints, four, eight years a day for quite a while. Diabetic it over 60. I disagree with what you said too because the things that you do with heroin and Coke and stuff, it's physically the ability to destroy your body. I mean, just take a look at David Crossby if you can stand it. Right. But, huh? And gambling if you can afford it, then you know, big no, but even if you can't afford it, at least you're still at least still. You have to tell me. Now, maybe emotionally you're a basketball case, but physically at least you still got your health. Right. It's true. So let's all get online. And let's plunge our guts out. Not. Don't ever do it. Okay. Don't ever point your figure of me say, Neorodges is what it is. I'm not ever got in fact the internet does not exist. There are no online gaming places and do not look up slot machines online. Because they all look very glitzzy and fancy and even play like any way in games and you'll never see your money. And we had one person in here that caught at the one guy he said in a couple of weeks. He got his money from that one online thing. Right. A couple of weeks. Maybe they got lucky and decided to pay a few people off. Make it look good. 12 13. If in fact, you know, something I think we just came up with a great idea. Let's just like how a burden does with those offshore phony offices. Let's open up a place like in a rouba and pretend we're going to have to investigate. That sounds great. They're really crying down there. Right. All of they do have gambling. And we can have our own offshore online gambling in a situation.

It's a print now right now. Here comes. Bill Clinton could soon be battling his old name, his Russian Limbaugh for arrest of premises is the aspirated reportly considers hosting his own radio show. All right. Quentin Clinton's old Hollywood pal, director Harry Thomas and the former president is talking with Radio giant queer channel about starting a new show. There's definitely a place for Clinton on radio at some point, Thomas, until it will finish week in the June 20 edition. A spokesperson for Texas based chief channel would only say that the company was talking with a number of high profile people and refuse to come in on a possible Clinton deal. Clinton's or Fisk and UPD, the weeks for comment. Through some of those from the radio network that's syndicates Limbaugh, the network could generate serious fireworks by scheduling both shows back to back industry watchers believe. Clinton has some honor of experience. Last week at the town hall style show to coincide with publication of his book. And that's him. That's true. How do you like that? Let me help you on nine to no one in the rest of the three. I'm just right off the map. Now. You don't have all these bits? Oh, that's true. Prosecutors speak in a rush. Prosecutors seek proof of drug abuse in Limbaugh's medical records. Can you believe that? Why don't they lead poor off, pill pop and hypocrite on Russia long liberal conspiracy? Tom Beach County Prosecutors told a judge yesterday they want to see all of our Rosh Limbaugh's seize medical records to determine what we engage in a long term pattern of criminal prescription drug abuse. For the first time, prosecutors said the records could provide a crucial link between allegations by Limbaugh's former housekeeper Wilma and leader allegations that Limbaugh engaged in doctors shopping for prescriptions. The former housekeeper Wilma Klein and her husband David Tom and S. Davis. They sold them by large quantities of prescription drugs bought on the street for many years to go to the search for its use to seize medical records. Oh, you know what's going to be out today? It's Thursday. The new National Enquirer. Oh, good. I better pop over right after the show and grab a hold of that because I want to see what they're going to be saying because they would like I've told you with the first ones. We had that story about that. Jesus, do Son here long before this late as trial. Jesus Christ. They had all kinds of stories about Michael Jackson, the Hanky Panky with those kids, and it would be real interesting to see what the inquire has to say. Assistants that attorney James Marks told Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Thomas Markdall that the records could show that the conservative radio hosting engaged in doctor's shopping, secretly obtaining overlapping prescriptions from different doctors in one month after the Klein stopped selling to them. There was a definitive start to the prescription medications that definitive start may welcome inside with the clients withdrawing their willingness to do business with Mr. Limbaugh, Marks said. More than a year and a half after prosecutors see records from four Limbaugh's doctors in late 2003. They are still waiting to review them. Limbaugh's high profile attorney, where Black is waging an intense legal battle to keep the records secret. Barkdale will soon rule on which records if any prosecutors can review. Black sought to have the war enshrooled invalid by Barkdale, the judge who approved them in the first place. Black contends that investigators misled the judge in the rapid avid outlining the allegations to support the war's. Barkdale rejected the argument for Black and raise it again. Mark said the prosecutors want all the records regardless of the time that they cover. In this case, the investigators didn't know whether the things that were shown to you in the affid able were the some total violations. What they didn't know is that they showed a pattern of violating the law. The law should be popping him. Who's been on the air for years? One in a finger with all the drug he's out there. They should all be on desk row. They should all be eliminated and exterminated all of these things got yada yada yada yada yada. How do you like that? Can you hear me? Russia's you're hearing still bad from all those oxies. What a joke. All there is a John Bolton on there. They recently passed on Bolton which is good. There's the Rubabitch. A judge is expected to rule on whether defense attorneys, the two suspects and naturally all the ways disappearance can have access to documents in the case. Have you noticed that strange accent there? Yeah. They're having kind of bread accent. This is the scene in international scandal. This scene in his pool again.

I promise this is the last story we'll have on this until the next one. The defense attorney who won Michael Jackson has agreed to be considering suing the Santa Barbara District attorney for malicious prosecution. I mean you think they want to open up that can't work. Yeah, come on. That's such a good idea. Bring it. Thomas Mesero Jr. also said to be demanding that the defeated prosecutor Tom. Mad Dog SNEDEN. No, not him. Oh, right. Give back the photographs taken a Mr. Jackson's genitals during a 1992 investigation into a abuse claim. The case for a report of $20 million. Mr. Jackson said the photo was taken by detectives who won the most humiliating expenses of his life. His legal team is believed to fear that Mr. Stead may leak the images to the public and revenge for losing their case. Well, who want to see that? Oh, my. Especially right in the middle of one time. The photographs were taken on Christmas Eve 93 after a Jordan Chandler accused the singer of sexual molestation. Mr. Jackson 46. Mr. Jackson later settled that case for a reported $20 million. Mr. Mesero now says the singer received bad advice and should have gone to trial. Why would you not end this Mr. Stead in once and for all, want to Mr. Jackson's legal advisors told the judge before website. And after asking me for the photos to be returned, you enjoyed them? No, but I bet you're Mr. Fudgewood enjoyed them. Ms. Fudgewood. You're fairie. Mr. Jackson's Trump. See, he is in him and is a girlfriend there. Lynn Stangles. What do I tell you about this? All during this whole trial going on. Always putting all the expulatory stuff on there, you know? What is it? Like a gig club is that what they think? Yeah, you ought to know. I'm not in it. I've been to Jackson's trial. Mr. Stead in Nice to judge for permission to enter an evidence to photograph so the singer's splotty penis permission was denied. That's what it says here. Mr. Mesero said on Larry King Live that he was sure there was a case for malicious prosecution. Asked to be thought Mr. Stead in this case was malicious. Mr. Robert Clyde. I do. I think he was treated in a way that no one else would have been simply treated. I think it was because he was a mega celebrity with a splotty unit. I like that. Right, I'd have to see it, I guess.

More than 50 camps found inside Del Ray home after fire discovered. Firefighters caught over a blaze at the home on Florida Boulevard late Wednesday and Del Ray. Beats found more than 50 camps inside along with the carcasses of others. No human injuries were reported. Here's the bad news, though. Yeah. Some of the cats escaped. Uh-oh. That's the bad news. Some of the cats escaped as firefighters brought the blaze. Some were rescued and made died. Fire rescue said. Exactly. Number's were not yet available. Trappers have been called into trying to snare the cats that escaped the flames. Give a hear of people going in snaring dogs. Yeah. You have? Sure. A pit bull's I guess. Yeah. I put pit bull's in cats in the same category. The fire was reported around 921 pm at home on the 2600 block of Florida Boulevard owned by Long-time resident Diane Gennigan. She was known at the time of the fire. When firefighters showed up, they found more than 50 cats in the resident. Several cats were found dead inside also. Some were just skeletal remains. Other carcasses in Zip block type bags. Well, that was good at least. The enforcement officers later deemed the house uninhabitable because of the animal waste found inside. Oh, Jesus, he just had a big litter box. It's a pretty nice day. They're in front of more of these places where these people are like, hold up and ask they got like 80 million dogs in cats and they're like living in these little cages. And what does that all about? Crazy. They're just lonely. Yeah, that's it. Is that what it is? That's that's growing. Hey, Ron. What's that version of what I'm telling, Ron? Keep trying, baby. This is another one of these stories that just, it makes me want to puked. It's so stupid, so superficial. Winner of 220.9 million dollar powerball direct pass says he wants more. Well, that part I like, but the part of the end where he says other than high end racing bicycle, he's got no plans for any large purchases. Right. The guy's name is Brad Duk. He says, one of my goals is keeping my feet on the ground, not forgetting who I am and where I came from. And staying active on things are like now, like biking, fitness industry, camping, wrapped up with my friends, keeping my feet on the ground is not a cool going up and buying a yacht. Well, yes, what Brad, how about going on by me one? Sure. Yeah, I'll take one. And George and Josh will need to take a small one too. And everybody had bicycle on the right. Right. Well, even take a low end. Or, you know, kind in a man who won that Jackpot Brad Duky 33 year old, regional fitness director for help club, chain and voisi on who is said he hopes to build a one billion dollar portfolio within 15 years. You go, Brad, we like you a lot. You're the kind of guy we want to get to know. We want to be real close personal friends. You're right. Since obviously he doesn't have any desire to go on by a whole bunch of other expensive stuff. Right. What better opportunity to have than me, if my age with this money to build a billion dollar empire to take care of my family and give opportunities to the people who give me opportunities. You told the APN Wednesday. Hey, Brad, if you'd like to invest it with a guy, you know, he's going to be a little bit more close out of make some serious money. Send it over here and like a brown paper bag. Do chose to take a one time payment of 125 point three million rather than 30. Not 30 minutes. And he will install with the 7.4 million. He would receive about 85 million in active taxes. Well, he's your flush in a way, lot of money. You know, but that again is part of that US thing with the alato's there. Big rip off. In other words, he went 220 million. But after all of taxes, everything is going to get 85 million. Okay. Or he would. And nobody's, but here he's getting lump sum 125 point three. So he's given away almost half. You see that? He won 220 point three million and he's getting on 25.3. I'd be really peowed. I would just wouldn't you. Yeah, I would probably protest. I don't have a lot of it. Commissioner Fistels denied Duke's request or a main anonymous argument that his name had to be a public to show we had no ties to a lot of employees or vendors. He was a jackpot over Memorial Day weekend. It would have been nice for me to take care of my family without making it a big thing in their lives. But we all came to the realization that it would be impossible. So if that's the way it's going to be, let's have fun with it. He said before traveling New York City for talk show appearances. Duke said he told his father and sister about the jackpot, but the rest of his family was unaware until Sunday when he asked to meet them in Sun Valley. He said they had assumed he was going to reveal a terminal illness, multi-level marketing scheme or a wedding engagement. Surprise.

Universal pictures and public affairs have agreed to pay close to a million dollars to buy the film and book rights to the life story of W Mark Stelt. People involved in the deal said yesterday. Mr. felt I pay like a couple hundred to spend an hour with his grandson. Just haven't dinner. Mr. Feld is a former FBI official recently said he was deep throat to secret source for Bob Woodward. The Washington Post reported to any watergate investigation. Remember that of course you know. The potential sale has been the subject of intense speculation in the publishing industry in the Hollywood since Mr. Feld's identity was a real last month on article in Vanity Fair. The contracts which are expected to be announced today include an option to produce a future film and the rights to a biography based on previously unpolished material written by Mr. Feld about his retirement from the FBI. Now the words about how he felt. The full amount to be realized by Mr. Feld's family will not be known for some time. It depends whether a film is actually made people involved that he will say. But the largest portion of the million dollar amount is likely to come from the movie rights. David Coolney, literary agent and coon prior to now Mark Tune at I&Z. That was the bad news during those days. What a downer he was. In fact you got to meet him at the passion that that big thing we had. That's right. Remember what did he pressing? He had that really no bad negative front-be kind of like body language. You know kind of like Chris Moore. I don't remember anything about him. Oh yes you do. I thought that you remember that night. I remember that night about this. I remember that night about this. We first got sold from IOD from Cox broadcast on the action. We all had this big seller. Some hotel area in Nadania. I do. Walter Sabo was there with his water. Oh my god Walter Sabo was there. The man that killed Jerry Williams. Oh. I think at the end of this he says something. The knee you were like a Joyce Hold. Let's go, Captain. There's a. Put it all the way down. We have these folks. Let's go. Hey Mark Tune, I hope you're still at down. Yeah. I do all to save all in the blackers of the van. I don't know how to sell my company call. No. I've got the tickets. The fact that he's proud of my hand. I'm good at thinking you were maybe a star. I'm over save of any. I can do anything I want to do. I'm here to sell this woman. And I'm gonna make a song for you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I've got the power to mold it to you. I'm sure. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. We have a way to get your own show. I have a station down in Hollywood. And it doesn't sound like you're reading the movie. It's the one that you can throw pieces. I'm off the stage, I'll be ready. And you'll do anything I want to do to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. I'll give it to you. Well I think you're. There we go. There we go. No way. Get out of here. I'm not putting that on there. It was on the yogurt every weekend. He said he wanted to use the high price bread, margarine. And anyway, and it wasn't that Karen K was she to wanted to... Oh yeah. That's the word. Puts her on here on IOD and then she announces that her first or second show that she's did with the consultant. And that's what she got to job. That's always a good way to impress the audience for her. But that was true, though. What? What about she announced? Why didn't she announce? I have one in my mouth once. I wonder she was laughing. Oh, I never see my woman. And anyway, yeah, I didn't see Walter. In fact, he took me to lunch once time and he already fed me. Park, right? Yeah. Right next door to the station. What was that? Like an eye half or something more? Denny's. That was Denny. Yeah, which is great. We loved Denny's a lot. Especially them flatjackies sandwiches. But, and then those mother sloppers pies. Those are the bears of splotty mothers splotty pies. But, man, and he, and then I fight out later, I was doing this probing me kind of like an alien. Really had to feel alien spaceman and feel to good. Now that's all he was still just trying to get information. Feeling you out. In formation. And anyway, he's a piece of ground. I wonder if he's still alive Walter's table. Boy, see evil. That's one of the reasons a radio business in the shape that it's in today is because of Jewish tools like him talking to the magazine. He has articles in there all the time. Does he really? Well, you're the one that reads that, huh? I don't know. Talk to his magazine where they had that big form of human is going to have a shout out, Frank, and off the stage. Yeah, that's the one. That's someone. Did I put that on a website or not? The Josh? No. Oh, maybe I just didn't want to give my life much publicity. Now worth it. Yeah, there was a story on there. I told you that he just wouldn't shut up and they had all these other people lined up to speak. And, man, bye, bye, bye, bye, I am. I am kept whining and droning and they started hooting and hollering just like when Arbor was speaking in California the other day. Here is some good news, fine. There is good news that I advocates of rewriting the USA Patriot actor claiming momentum. There got the big mo. After the house, despite a White House veto threat voted to restrict investigators from using the anti-terrorism law to pick it, library records and books to a sales slips. Yesterday's 238 to 187 vote came as lawmakers ramped up efforts to extend the Patriot Act, which was passed real fast in the emotional aftermath of 911. When Congress passed a lot, included a sunset provision under which 15 of its provisions are to expire at the end of this year. Since the Patriot Act passed, liberals and libertarian oriented conservatives have pressed for changes, citing privacy and civil or a liberties concerns. The administration said weakening the Ecuador veto from Al-Presidentate. No question. This is a real shot in the arm for those of us who want to make changes to the Patriot acts that represented Bernard Sanders independent of Vermont, sponsored the provision that were curtailed against the ability to investigate the reading habits of terrorist aspects. He said the vote would help rein in an administration in 10 on shipping away at the very civil liberties that defined as a nation. The vote reversed a narrow loss last year by lawmakers concerned about the potential and based on privacy of innocent library users. They narrowed the proposal this year to permit the government to continue seeking out records of internet use and libraries. So in other words, if you go on the internet at the library, you're like plugging your guts on some online casino, they're going to know. That's at least a little tiny, you don't want to say it's one small step right. Time, 18. 18. Okay, I guess we ought to take a call or two, not that we have a lot. 560, 560 in the Verizon and Singular Wireless Line. Do you have any QAM? Hello. On Comino? Yes sir. Hawaii. Okay. Before I get to meet in my car, I have to do a mo, a mo bit. I was just thinking now when you told George when you were playing the stable thing, oh, I'm not going to play that or whatever. He's heard about these two guys that are the who the older and 95.27 that apparently they got in some hot water because they were saying all these things. They don't want to have to be down the air. You heard about this. Right. I think I know that you're going to be able to do this? Hello? Yeah, we're listening. Okay. So my wife lives into these clouds in the morning and a few months back. I'm sure you don't even ever heard about this one. This is a CM2 FM, I believe. It's something like that. Yeah. Like one of them you can't really tell he's a Julio. He's like me and George. No accent. So when you're doing something, you have an accent. Sorry. The other one you can tell is a Julio my wife. I think they called Howard because Howard that and low and behold Howard turns around and says, well, thanks a lot for sucking up. By the way, we're the ones that read it. You guys often have to be at the seat. Really? Yeah. I mean, they got off his foot Howard and they went back and forth. I didn't hear the calm. I wiped it. You guys aren't up to get it done? What's up with this? How long goes this? Uh, I've been no more in three or four months ago. They called the Kiss His As and how he was the king of all media and he's the best and Howard get up by the way, we're ready to do that. You mean Howard Stern? Yeah. Oh, I mean, he's the easier way earlier. He said he would call it about, oh, I see about Howard. I'm sorry. I was going to tell you something before I got to the meat of the moment. Okay. I called you a few days back in reference to these moping, right? I'm a little confused, but I've been confused for a long time. So maybe it's me. I don't know. Wait, wait. Let's stop for a second. I'm confused. I'll understand. Are you following this George? Yeah. They called up Howard Stern? Yes. Yes. This is the fact that Kiss His As and how they lost it and then all the other ones who read it, you asked that the FTC, well, how to help him. What he do that? He's not in the slaughter. At least that's what he claimed. Uh, I think this was still when he was on the air down here. Yeah, but he wasn't even a show from there. Oh, I know. So Howard, they do here in CMQFAMA. I don't know, Neil. But that's what he told these guys. I don't know if it's sure he's just set it up in the mopping. He always sounds like to me. I'm kind of alive. But anyway, moving along. I think he could have been along. So the moment, right? Yeah. I called you like a week back or whatever. And we were talking. And I thought you had said you can't play any moments where mold gets raised. Remember? I never said that. Yeah. Yeah. You told me, no, that's not correct. I can't. But then when I request one, you told Joshua, this guy's crazy. I can't play that. So I don't know what but then that's for a different reason. There's, for others, obviously different language and there are different stuff. It's not because he's getting raped. Because they're the language. And how he's getting raped. Right. And how often and whether you like to do not. This is so insane. I don't know. They don't love to know. Welcome to America. Maybe if I were you, I'd give back an at interview and head right on back somewhere. Well, Neil, any moment that you can play any gets raped, I love to hear it. Okay. Thank you. Oh, my god. Oh, my god. Talking about the, the Os song is that effect? The Os song? Yeah. There's no, there's no word for a play in that. The Os one? Yeah. The Os, the Os, the Os, the and Harry or one? No, no. I know which one you're talking about. That's what I'm playing at because you were playing the little did you? Yeah, before the show, right on here. No, no, no, let's be. Oh, just the song. We can play that. What's wrong with that? Nothing. There's words in there we can play. And look at that. You just got me so whipped up. I knocked it out of the other to the audition line. It just calmed down. Will you play? Yo, yo, yo, let's read. Oh, three, yo, big shot. Oh, go, go, go, go. That's how we pass the time. Oh, wait. In the game. Yo, jail, oh, oh, oh. There's nothing wrong with that. In fact, I can't like it. I'm glad that you reminded me to play it again.

Same thing. Watch Batman on TV with, you know, what's his name? Bert Ward and Bert Reynolds. I know who the hell was in. What is wrong with you? We're just watching at the end of the day. I read that book. And I'm West. Best by test, although I look rather better. But anyway, you watch that show and then you watch these movies. And it isn't even related to the comic strip. What does it have to do with reality? What does it have to do with anything? And then all his retro garbage, all Batman begins. And then Batman is a baby and Batboy. And that's in the belly free. Come on already. Enough with the garbage. Or speak in a garbage. Here's another reason to hate your buddy or Bill Gates. Yeah. Chinese bloggers posting their thoughts via Microsoft's net service. Facebook restrictions are what they can write. Here's the story. The start of the news. Weblog in freeze and some parts of Microsoft's MSN site in China using words such as freedom, democracy, and demonstration are being blocked to the Chinese bloggers already faced with controls. The most registered their online journal with Chinese authorities. Microsoft said the company invited by the laws regulations and norms of each company which it operates. The censorship is thought to have been introduced as a concession to the Chinese government. In other words, we don't care what you do to it. This is as long as we can make some money from you. Also being restricted on the free parts of the site. Our journal entries that mentioned human rights and Taiwan independence. God forbid. Reportives without borders says following Yahoo. Here's a second American internet giant giving way to the Chinese authorities. And agreeing to self censorship. If that lovely. Those using the band words are writing entries that are pornographic or contain sensitive information. Get a pop up warning that reads. This message contains a band expression. Please delete this expression. Microsoft MSN spaces. This is a space site. This run by its door and venture partner. The state back Shanghai Alliance investment limited. And obviously what you can put on there is very limited. Microsoft said people who used its MSN spaces service were required to buy by its quota conduct. The code says that users are not allowed to upload both to distribute any content which violates any local and national laws that apply to your location. Microsoft is a multi-national business. And as such, needs demand to be able to evaporating in countries around the world. And Microsoft spokesperson told the BBC News website. I'm like that. China recently introduced stringent regulations that require all blog owners to register the web journal with a state by the 30th of this month. Not third man. Regulations require the right of a blog to identify themselves to the authorities. Okay. You will identify yourself and you will, you know, eat your chops. Or just give you the old chop chop. You're saying like that. I don't, but you know, they got a man. The book, you know, he's starving. Okay. Because that's right. He needs that money. But he wants to catch up to that tarble winner. Here's some bad news. Let's see aerosmith, although I do like aerosmith a lot. Percy aerosmith, who with this wife set a record two weeks ago for the world's longest marriage, died yesterday at the age of 105. His wife of 80 years was by a side. Marriage for 80, long excruciating years. How do you like that? Oh, good for him. So he made it. He set the record two weeks ago. Many croaked. Aerosmith died at his home in Heraford, northwest of London. His bishop said, Aerosmith and his hundred year old wife Florence, Wow. Celebrated their 80th wedding anniversary in a place in the Guinness Book of Records in June 1. Percy and Flo were very happy when I saw them on the Man of the Man of the Wrestler. He said the Reverend Anthony Prittis Bishop of Heraford, Heraford, whatever it is. There were still very much in love with each other. They kept drooling a lot, but nevertheless, earlier this month, the Guinness Organization recognized the Paris holding records for the longest marriage for a living couple and the oldest aggregate age of a married couple, which would have been a hot 205. Almost old enough to live in surfside. The aerosmiths who have three children, six grandchildren, nine great grandchildren, said to the key that their long marriage was not to go to sleep on an argument. Aerosmith said there was something else. I always said, yes, dear. He said, keep that in mind, Joyce. Always say, yes, dear, no matter what she says, it is here. It doesn't help. Still what's more. And then stick your head in that flavor wave to the large oven for about three minutes on high cooking. See if that's on straight in the ranch. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 5, 60, any Verizon. See the great part about that is that you can take that top part off and keep it on. Oh, that's right. Yeah, you could put it like a half. Yeah. Like a hat or like when you see the women in the beauty problem with that thing on her head, you know? Yeah, the little curls just try to get in here. Honey, oh, yeah. Talk about a cooler. No brains. Ha ha ha. Curl your brains. Dominique, you I am. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I was talking to my wife the other day about Tom Cruise. Yeah. And she was saying, we're talking about how he's brainwashing Katie Holmes into the Scientology. Absolutely. No question about it. And my wife goes, well, that's not so bad. They're like those Christian scientists aren't they? Right. And it's struck me that the average person has no idea what Scientology is. Hmm. Well, and why does the media shy away from that and not say, hey, Tom Cruise believes in Ali. I have bays. Right. And Al-Ran, how about don't forget about him. They sue everybody. Right. But how can they sue you if you tell the truth? I mean, it's the truth. And then Ali, they just want to create a hassle. It's just that we have intimidating people. No, keep it in the mouth shut. But Jordan, I'm sure we'll talk about him a lot while I'm on vacation. Are sure we'll. If you have a purpose to do, what are they going to get? Nothing. If the average person knew the Tom Cruise. Absolutely. Believe in Ali and say, we think the guys are holding loan. Right. And look, everybody's not a have a place to hide. You know, it's a very comfortable closet. It's a lot of revolt as in here. Lisa Marie, I mean, what's wrong with Tom Cruise being in here? And if I Katie Holmes, just a couple of months ago in an interview, and some magazine was saying, what a devout Catholic she was and how big Jesus is in her life. Not no mole. And now she's joining a church. This is where I eat this is a myth invented by Aliens. There you go by Ali on. Okay. Good luck to you, Pelle. Good luck to all of us. You're fair. There you go. That's for Tom Cruise. And for Lisa Marie. You're fair. And for John Reeve. You're fair. And all the other people involved in that cult. They got a huge, I don't know if it's still there anymore is matter. Fact in Toronto, they have like a whole block that they hold up. That's how they operate. I haven't been in an area in quite some time. I have to check that out. See if they're still around. My good friends at the Scientologist. So maybe I haven't been in their closet for a while. Speaking of that, challenging earlier findings, two studies from a conservative research group reported to us. They that young people will take virginity pledges have lower rates of acquiring sexually-transmitted diseases and engage in fewer sexual, risky, sexual behaviors. However, everybody else says it's a polycrap. Wait to hear which group this is. The new findings by the Herodids Foundation are based on the same national survey used in earlier studies and conducted by the Federal Department of HHS. The authors of the new study used different methods of statistical analization that knows in an earlier report that was widely publicized making direct comparisons difficult. Independent experts call the new findings provocative, but they criticize the hematist foundation's analization is flawed and lacking these statistical evidence to support their conclusions. The new findings have not been submitted to a journal for publication and author said. The independent experts who reviewed the study said the findings are unlikely to be published in their present form. In other words, basically, as usual, you get from the Herodids Foundation, it's a pack of light. Because every study that we write about, of course, to show that this whole absence thing doesn't work and all these virginity pledges and these people are doing as much hanky, panky if not more than anybody else and getting as many diseases and of course all these things. They could put us. It's really interesting in the mass media now. They put these people on. Well, so-and-so from a Herodids Foundation are from Hocus, focus on a family. Let these are some kind of mainstream responsive organizations as opposed to the right way in fundamentalist lunatics that we all know they are. And they're just all over the place now. It's like even more than the test padder, more than the infermerschels on a weekend. 26 past one at five, 16. We're going to have an Elron Hub up on tomorrow. Are we? From the great thing.

It's the toll, the toll, the toll. I think when you're going away, you're with me. Yeah, the way you're going, having to fall in. You take me and going, you're with me. You're going to die. Oh no, the car is the door to the door to the door to the door to the door to the door to the door to the door. And don't fall in. I think you're really with me. When you're just going to die.

I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. I'm a spy. He made me a romance. Yeah. What's his story? I'm a spy. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. I don't know what's his story. 133-274-The-Doyman. 12-12-Toyman. 12-Toyman. A man who played a gully to taking part in a cross-boarding and private studio in Pat West Virginia lost in his bit to be mayor. Well, that good news? Yeah, it is. Greg Bess. No relation to Bess Truman. Greg Bess garnered 41 votes in Tuesday's nonpartisan election coming in a distant second to Anne Nees. A social justice officer at West Virginia University Institute Technology of 104 vote. Two other candidates. And got fewer votes than Bess. Vesta coal mining contractor in chairman of the Towns utility board has said his role in the 1999 cross-boarding was exaggerated and was more of a joke that just got on a hand. Just for the record, Greg Bess is not a racist best said before the election. Basically a gully in 2001 to a criminal conspiracy charge telling a federal judge that he built across and carried it to the residents of Lucy Roberts who was at home babysitting for a two year old vibrational granddaughter. Well, sounds like just a joke to me, don't it? A hurr? He was sentenced to 30 days. Hey, I'll end three years probation and find a thousand dollars. I think that the citizens are making a statement that they didn't care for Bess's behavior and his participation in the cross-boarding he said Wednesday credits a seven West Virginia town of about 530 residents. 530. You know, it's a good thing that Josh got to watch the liberal in a couple days ago. Like that. Because one of how you can get a better insight is to the nature of the people who are running America these days. Yeah, that's actually what I thought about when I was right. The people have taken over the Aintree crowd. They're going to go out. That's this crowd. You better believe it. They're all Ken Man. Pittsburgh and a count. I got a whole bunch of these goofy stories. I love him. And a count in his motto was live until Friday. Kind of like that movie you're owning the honey. Yeah. Oh, and I got bad news for a George. I knew I forgot something. Bad news. Amazon.com says, ah, oh, it's like North by Northland. What do you know, they had some email here sometime back and said, in order for us to postpone the date and not cancel the order. You have to click here and so I clicked there and I thought I had it all done. I'm pretty sure I did, you know, I clicked it. And now they're saying, well, because you didn't respond to Yadiyati, or unfortunately you've had a cancel. So what I'm going to do is I'll go buy it. All right. I'm going to pay you. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. You're on vacation. Yeah, I got plenty of time. In fact, what I'll do is maybe I'll buy it there. No, I'll buy it here. And I'll mail it from there. Okay. I'm sure it's how I'm going to bring it to you. All right. Yeah. Pretty sad. I'm going to see all those people there. I'm not there. In fact, I probably won't see any of you again, you know? It's been a lot of fun. Bye. We got your picture over here. Have any of you pardon me? Get your picture over here on the wall. Yeah, that's right. Look at the picture. I was younger than anyway. And a calendar's model was live until Friday. Played the guilty, distilling between a million and two and a half million from clients. And lavishing strippers with gifts and jobs. John J. Bowman 52, no kind of Travis Bowman of Shaler or a Venereal Bowman. Played the guilty to date and defrauding 11 clients between 1994 and 2002. According to prosecutors, Bowman spent client money at a strip club, dropping more than $1,000 a night. He also hired young women to work at his 90-funked business, Bowman and associates. He hired a strip for his secretary and gave her 20 grand for a down payment on a home and paid her 600 bucks a week. The plea of being caused for Bowman to make restitution, he scheduled to be sent in September 20-3. Live until Friday, that was his model. All right. Now we're trying to do it here. Only got like 24 minutes to go today and then of course tomorrow. Hey, you're my English. I think all great comedy bits tomorrow. No, too. Okay. That's all I should winter? Cup out. I mean, yeah, I wouldn't do that. Like I said, on Monday, I'm taking all comedy. Ooh, yeah. Golden retriever is summoned to court. Now, my golden retriever was never summoned to court. That's a good thing. Newt and acid Tuesday. Murphy is awaiting his day and court. The question is whether court is ready for him. Murphy is a three-year-old golden retriever who received a summons last week to appear in Newton District Court. To answer a complaint that he was walked without a leash and leash twice and was not off today at his door license. Actually, it wasn't Murphy, but his owner Stephen Dean who was supposed to get the summons. He can't read. So I sounded on his behavior requesting hearing Dean told the Metro West Daily News of Framingham. I don't even know if they let him into the court house, especially if he drops the number on a floor. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't that be a great editorial comment? That would be. Is that your plea? We ever seen a golden retriever doing the old squat? Believe me. It's a very serious piece of business. Newton police find Murphy $25 for not having a leash and $25 for not being licensed when animal control officer John O'Connell stopped Murphy in his master June 3rd. Court magistrate Henry Schulz said in his 35 years of the Newton District Court, he's never heard of a dog receiving a ticket. He must not know about those people in California with a chicken got to Jay walking ticket. I think Murphy's the first defender we said Monday, we've had people bring their dogs into the courthouse, but not like this. What are we going to do if Murphy appeals to Ohio court? He said, it's that cute. Kind of like a yuck. That's probably the kind of humor they tell up there. And it was an entry. That's probably kind of jokes they really yuck it up pretty good. I would think. And like I said, these people are running the country. The hoax focus family focus on a family, hoax focus on your family, hoax focus on him and fagots. Yeah, and all that stuff. And of course, the anti-san defiderous crowd. They're running a miracle. 21 till 2 at 2 a.m. We'll be going. I'm a little bit trying to treat you. You're not. I'm a little bit rocking. You're fair. You're me book show off on long hair. When we sing on American Idol. I mean she's like pouring a car. I'm never hit on Paul. I have to. I'm a little bit trying to treat you. I'm a little bit rocker roll. She's a little energy nerd. She's a little real diamond. She's a little bit fragile. Well, soon but she's more Marie. I'm a little bit too don't know how to shake her stuff. I don't know how to shake but not too weak. No more country will ever. When you told me you don't have a recipe. And I like for best of it. I'm more stranded on happy meals. I hope you're good. You'll give me all the rules. I hope they can prepare me. Well, I'm not a lot more. She'll be marching to keep my time. Play it, get shut your hope. Come on a little bit trying to treat. And I'm a little bit rocker roll. He likes to powder his mouth. Like I said, they were a 145 at 560WQN. Here's some good news. What's that? You know, there's two drunken pilots. Yeah. Well, they're going to remain in jail until they're sentenced. Month after they were not bailed today. All right. Take County Circuit Judge David Young has an edgy tone as he addressed pilot Thomas Floyd, 47 and copilot Christopher Hughes, 44 and order them held at least another five weeks. Well, they might just have flown away. They went to jail right after the verdicts were read last week after being free on bail for nearly three years while the contest of the charges and guess why not free no more. They're going to be held until they get sentenced. Excellent. Don't want no drug and powder on the planet. I get on. I'll tell you that right now. Conversely, yeah, charges were dismissed today against the 19 year old Inlet Grove High School student charged with hacking the Palm Beach County School District's computers. Ryan Duncan, a Palm Beach Gardens as we debate, $2025 an investigative cost and complete 100 hours of community service. He also has to write letter of apology to the district. I don't sound too bad. I'll be able to say, I apologize. That's it. Right. That'll do it. Under the agreement overseen by Judge Lucy Chernobyl Brown. They haven't hours of community can be waived. If not going to increase the work of the school district, we had a program on the seriousness of computer crime. Investigators believe Duncan legally obtained a password that let him have access, let him access district servers. Duncan may have received the login information by looking over the shoulder of a computer technician who was working at Inlet Grove High School in Riviera, but in the middle of the week, where the teams had students, district spokesman, had had herringed and said in the April interview. Duncan was arrested last month by school district police, charge with the fences against intellectual property and felony. He was released on his own reconnaissance. Under the terms of his release, he's a lot of computer access only in work, our service official said. Go let him on your computer Josh. Okay. He'll be hacking it. Speak out of that, think him to New York. Have you ever been there? Don't. Okay. No. A sheriff's department office is ready to face the hot water after leaving her gun gun and a Binghamton County bathroom. Binghamton courthouse bathroom. But I said, I've read. Let me say it again. And a Binghamton courthouse bathroom. A broom County Sheriff's Department of Corrections Officer removed her 40 caliber block pistol by using the facilities. But she left the weapon behind when she left the restroom. I mean, there was the number one and number two and then the number nine forty five. I was a 40 caliber block. It could have anybody. The gun was found by civilian who alerted a courthouse security officer. Sheriff David Hartford told a Binghamton officer without her piece for less than five minutes. Harder said an investigation. The incident has been conducted the meantime. The officer had been taken off the courthouse detail and decided to go to the office. He said the officer was very upset over the gun jonder. Go be doing it again sweetheart. Ross did by Oming. Pamford Atturk and that's her name. Fetterturk. So where she was going to attend the Mule Day's Festival. Even if she had arrived at Mule to get there. And you know what she did? What? She was a veteran. Atturk and her friend Terrell Louis traveled some eight hundred and fifty miles on the back of a mule from Alberta, Canada, to recusen Jake Clark's ranch in northern Wyoming. See this is more than entry crowd. The women were a fraud mule named Sadie and Goliath and brought a pack mule angel to carry their supplies. Mule days which kicked off two days celebrate the notoriously stubborn animal with mule center creases, rodeo or that rodeo and other events. For their troubled a human and their mule's will serve as grand marshals for the mule day parade. Well, I thought she was nuts to begin with said Clark who said his grandfather. Who said his grandfather, who said his grandfather, two hollings worth made a similar trip on horseback some eight years ago to find work in METTC. M-E-E-T-E-T-S-A-N-E-T-C. That is touching it. Don't touch those. He told me she knew what entity did to her son. I'm pretty proud of her. Well, that's great. And of course we know about John Madden, right? The hopper called in yesterday with the load on that. We didn't need to hear no sticking press conference did we? Because we had the good news from the hopper. I think we should have carried it.
