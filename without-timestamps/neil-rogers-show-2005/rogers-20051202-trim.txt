I know it's not doing it the ordinary way. It's just going very slowly. I don't know what that indicates because being, you know, computer-related. I bet you Josh knows, not 10, 20. 10, 20? Josh doesn't even know what does means. Oh, I see. What's that? What's that? What? Why didn't you ask me this thing about Foxfire? Firefox? Oh, because it just came across. I didn't know. It's been downloaded more than 100 million times since the release. It's good. Although now that I got my new computer, I got my Windows 3000. You don't really, the Explorer is never all the negatives that it has on the older computers. You don't get all the viruses, the X-Fan, the X-Fan. Oh, look at that. Validium curve files is 2.8. Okay, this is the slowest process in this human kind. I don't, a little bit nervous about that. I gave it the old whammy. So we're not going to have any Qs when we do the commercial outbreaks. I just, I'll just hold a finger up. How's that? All right, well, then hit it. When you hold a finger up, I'll hit the Q. Oh. The American military Thursday said that former American troops that including two Marines of recruitment combat operations in the rebellious province of Anbar. There were rebellious over there, where military commanders have pressed a series of intensive sweeps to disrupt insurgents, networks in advance of national lessons in December 15. Four more dead Americans every day. It's a two over here, and a three over there, and five over at six, whatever. Every single day. And there, and, you know, they're still trying to muster a little bit of courage to the opponents of the war. You got a good piece of news. I forgot to tell you this. Yep. About move on.org is considering, they're considering supporting Jewelie Romans upon it, is democratic upon it in the primary and Connecticut. That nice piece of news. That's not going to necessarily get loose, but at least there is some other people who will misunderstand up against this lunatic maniac, this lawfuler. 1433 votes were sorry. It didn't like our poll yesterday. So, this isn't even the one. One on there now with a movie. Sam, getting too far ahead of myself. I'm not going to do that today, because the one for Monday doesn't need any building. I would have given my research online to make sure I didn't leave any major things off of there. So, we don't need to do that. So, that means we can take at least four or five thousand calls day, especially with our DCS problem here. It's not doing anything at the moment. This is validating car files. It's thinking about it. So, in the very liberal way, I guess, when you get to be old, you get slow. We can relate to that, some of us. Despite there, denial is this is the poll from one was this poll from two weeks ago. It's somehow store, I don't know. 1433 votes despite their denial, everyone loves to fart. 278 jokes that chicken 253. Make sure you don't have the old bird flu. As sexual fantasies, one's 70. Picks their nose, one's 43, and then what do they do with it? No's W is totally 2,000, 2,000 for elections, one's 26, lies, 116. All the liars all the time. Enjoys 4,094. Listen to Neo-Ranger 61. Peace in the shower 31. I was peeing in the shower this morning. I kept thinking about, why would anybody deny this? What's not to like? Why would they be? It is, and it's certainly on ladylike if you happen to be one. I see. On ladylike? Yeah, you know. Why would there be any problem with that? The water is a cushion and the white TV cushion. Huh? Because it's pee. I see. Oh, there's nothing wrong with pee. Tickles the taco 31. Cheats on the taxes 29. Each their boogers 26. Josh was peeping his guts out thinking about that. Oh, we're all the way up to I. I. Look at that. And that good. So this is, this is doing the right thing. But it's doing it in slow motion. Use it this goes flying through these. Notice that indicate to you when you kind of a, uh, syndrome? No, this is fairly. Oh, it's just taken a very slow look. And how many letters are we going to go through? Well, now what are these letters? Hey. Ha ha ha ha ha. No, but I mean, what am I indicate? Uh, you can only have four digits when you make a cart number in the DCS as you know. Yes. And that can be a, a numeral or a letter of the alphabet. Oh, I know we start them with a, uh, with letter of alphabet. So if you go through all of those, if we know, you don't go through j. If we only use numbers, we would only go through j. What does that stand for? Jewish? We would only be able to have, uh, you know, 9,999 cuts. Right. And he was what's called the hexadecible system. Oh, well, let's not, like I said, nobody cares. Uh, she's out there taxes 29 each their book is 26 disgusting although low carb by the way, Atkins approved. Uh, smokes weed 16 loses their ass gambling 15 loves garbage CV 15, fears death 12. Takes their butt 11. That is really. Right. And uses body wash six. That was the pull from, I don't know. Yes, they are. Yes. I see I'm losing track now. I can't keep track no more. And then the one about the ending of the movies, which they hate. As somebody last at the outside you bought. I told you about it. And you haven't seen maybe Josh, so I said you're with canvases. You're in, um, William H. Macy. I have not. No. Said you're. It's okay. It can't make up it's mind if it wants to be real super serious or wants to be part comedy. Uh, it was good. Uh, I'm the old hole. It was good. So to speak. 10 14 at five six. You don't forget what I give to the end of this spot. You're going to have to like hit your thing there. Because I'm only on the eye. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, well, got it. Got it. So I think it's exciting that this happened today. And now, and now the real excitement is when it gets done doing this will go back to, uh, what it was before. Right. And if it doesn't, uh, well, to bad. It's that most wonderful time of the year. Unless, of course, you hit the crowd at malls. Those crazy choppers.

It's taking a rest right now. It's old and slow. And it's 1019 if you want. This has a little excitement, a little possessed to our otherwise boring Friday. Right? This is like, who's just in the little bit. Speak to the fish. Marlon's president David Samson last week. Detailed while there'd be no stadium deal with the city of Miami. Wednesday, yesterday, city manager yesterday. What the, is it? Yesterday, all day I thought it was Friday. Right? Today Saturday, right? Sunday. Oh. Wednesday, city manager Joe Erigola offered a biting perspective that spoke to the ideological and personal gulf between the two sides. In other words, they heated a like poison. Back from vacation, Erigola blasted Samson for absolutely the line to the public about the Marlon's contribution to the project. He also termed Samson and owner Jeffrey Luria, carpet baggers, and in that the negotiation would have gone more smoothly with a local ownership group. Carpet baggers, how do you like that? Yeah. Josh. Your team? O'eron J. Now. I'm looking at that. J stands for Jewish. Oh, hey. And what's going to happen after it finishes with J? That's it. J oughta be the last, uh, like. Oh. I know. You know something. If this happens, I'm going to let out such a good try here on a year. I'm going to think that you got shot. Oh. Did you start a new letter up there? I figured you're part of it. Did you start a new letter like N? Of course. But I thought you said it will go through J. Well, that's down here. What letter did you start? Oh, I'm on N's already. Okay. Then. So this is going to go all the way through N. Yeah. But there's something between J and N. Oh, no. I've got L and, uh, who knows? Lucky strike means find a Vaco, LSMFT. Number those days, of course, you know, the Vechibloka brand is. He's probably puffing out a few of them. Faggot's right now. Among the several issues on which Ariel and Samson are an odds is how much money the team would run to the project. Samson, I've weeks said the Marlins were prepared to make a $212 million contribution to a plant baseball only for silly decision to the Orange Bull. That figure includes annual rent for Ariel those focuses on upfront payments. I don't care how David wants to dress this Ariel, I said. How he wants to dress it. It's an absolute outright lie. He's putting 30 million. Not 30 million in the field and the story. If I have an apartment building and you come to rent for me, what is that? Is that a contribution to my profit? A contribution to my mortgage? Nothing. What I do with the money is beside the point. Samson pointed Ariel's unfamiliarity with such deals saying team contributions are always measured by the present value of rent payments. Another issue where the party's difference cost overruns. The total price of the project ballooned to $385 million because the original estimates were based on the ballpark opening earlier. Area Olicon citizen increase an overrun and call it convenient that the Marlins do not. If the Marlins couldn't make up the initial difference, he wanted about their building cover overruns once construction began. The price of the project amounted because his inability to do a deal led to a delayed opening which caused increased construction cost, which we had to cover because nobody else would Samson said. It's not an overrun. Again, it shows his relative inexperience in this arena. By definition, there is no such thing as an overrun until a project is being built. He ought to be familiar with that because the performing arts center has overruns. Perhaps that the root of the failed agreement is the two sides underlying content for each other. They hate each other like poison. Hey! Area Olicon makes clear his dis-taste for a sense and his negotiating tactics. Samson wonders whether the city and mommy ever wanted a deal or first place if they considered a lawyer an outsider. If Jeffrey Lawyer would have sent a professional to do this deal, it would have been a lot easier. Area Olicon said this problem is he sent somebody who's never done this deal, who's never done it in the deal in his life. I don't want to say it's a personality conflict. I deal with all kinds of personalities all day long and has nothing to do with personality. It competences him much better word. Samson countered. Everything I know about negotiating with boy tactics I learned from Area Olicon. It's disappointing that the city would hold up a sign to a new world series parade that said, if we build it where you come and it was merely an election strategy and other desire to listen to what constituents really want. As of last week, the Marlins had majorly baseball's blessing to be exploring all that relocation, threatening, relieving, and relieving. Nothing's over till it's over Area Olicon. I think getting somebody like David out of the equation would probably help. Is he talking about Samson and David Samson or Mohour David? But I really think it's the whole attitude of David Laurie. He says, I'd love to see local ownership whether it's from Brower, Dave South Florida for that matter getting Bob and Good things done. When's the sense and reiterated that Laurie is a local owner would never sell a franchise, especially not to a South Florida-based buyer? Over the biggest problems we've had all along as we've viewed Jeffrey and David truly is carpet vagres that we were all said that came with a bag of debt for Montreal. They're not local people. No local investor in their right mind would invest with them because the terms they want. Cutty like that, they hear each other. It's great. It's the typical South Florida-F and way, baby. FOOF! I like that. It's beautiful. All the way up to J, almost the end of the J's. Cool. But you're telling me I gotta go through N? Yeah, but there should be nothing in between J and Area Olicon. Let's use something on there. I think I don't really recall. Could be on each other. What? We'll find out, I guess soon, Molly. We will. Rump the J.P. Remember him? Yeah. Harry. What movie had the most unacceptable ending that was our full night? We'll say this for a second. I had a fine ending. There was nothing wrong with it. And William H.Macy was great as usual. Can Bacy look at you and look at you over 90? God, she was all well. That's what you're supposed to be. She's going to be younger. 707. On the poll today, 707 most. They don't like this poll. I put it up. I'll go around 5.30. Six o'clock last night and I thought you would be a phenomena. We should have had the other choice on it, which we can still do. I didn't, I never seen any of these. Oh, okay. We want to put that on and share. Never saw any of these. So they can't tell you about the ending. How could they never have seen any of these? Yes. That could be blind. No, no. Seriously. There's, there's not like any movie on here that's like, really, stupid. Is there? Some of them are highly hyped. No. But I mean, these are movies that everybody in their brothers saw. There's not one of them on here that you could say in their category. category. Oh, the jays are done. We're done with the jays. Everybody keep track right on your wrist. Like the guy in my mental right at down. We're done with the jays on validating the cart files in the ECS. Oh, man. Which movie had the most unacceptable ending Blair Witch Project 88 million dollar baby 58 contact 57. See I didn't see any of those. Ward of worlds 55 saw the first one did not want or need to see the second one. One flew over to Cook was missed 43. I guess everybody saw that. Right? We're just upset. We're just upset. We're upset about four uh, Mr. McMurphy. Good fellow 35. Mighty Python and a holy grail 34. Great movie bed ending. Vanilla Sky 33. The village 32. Monsters evolve 27. See it wasn't just my imagination. Monsters evolve 27 way more than make go to the head 15 by the way. That's because nobody saw that with. What's the time in America? 26 unbreakable 22 signs 22. T 21. AI. AI 21. Up in smoke 18. Milha and drive 16. Magnolia 15. The birds 14. Momento 13. Donnie Darko 11. Jacob's ladder 10. Jeepers creepers where'd you get those Mr. Peepers 10. Bridges Atocore 9. Screen 7. Lord of the Rings part one five legends of the fall for white and red pit have to die. It was a fish and accident somebody got heard. The vanishing American version four and less than zero had a little more not much more than zero than had three out of seven thirteen. Lessons and you see that know it's a rubber dotting junior movie. Oh god and I've never seen any of these has got zero so that's got to listen but I'll look at it we're on K already. All right so probably we gotta go through K and LSM and if uh Lucky Strike means fine LSM FT and then what? See ordinarily this zips through these real fast. I would be going real slow can you I mean you know it's a little bit about computers not too much. They would be like just the amount of stuff that's on there. Well I didn't do this last week when you're on vacation I don't know. It would you be in there. Let's see. It went different flying through there I'm slow it down. That must be it. Okay we're gonna take a trading call today because it is Friday. We got a lot of our good friends out there we probably want to hear from today when you think of course. And wasn't that interesting at the end of the show yesterday we found that we discovered that mopro mode at Josh's sneak in there the long with a go guard area and most is I like that guy. It was kind of interesting. Now as opposed to the regular cue because I don't want you to play that from there what could I play here? I got it listen 10 27 a QAM. Whooフ hit it George Bush A No need to budge, he's a real judge, he's got a name My little sweet tells me what is things about broken way Next up they seem a leader with a committing to a future To a sin, one more judge, I'll let him live, let him stand down in really stupid What the hell are you going to do? A leader, a leader, a leader If you can't get a leader out of the road, if you can't push, Don't push, only hope, a leader What the hell are you going to do? We're sitting in the stand, he ate the bullet Didn't get one of my crony's, one more judge We're going to take that, we're going to be a judge We're going to take that, we're going to be a judge We're going to take that, we're going to be a judge We're going to take that, we're going to be a judge We're going to take that, we're going to be a judge We're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that We're going to take that, we're going to take that, we're going to take that But you're part of hard drive. It's fragmented What what does that mean? That means you should defragment it And how to help my ass And don't worry, don't be pushing the envelope here, okay, don't be pushing More luck, and that's just flashing please wait, so one of these minutes It's going to go on out of this back on evaluating cart files again This is exciting, this is like doing table I play, guilty I sure hope he booked up a little bit on it broadcast last night Panters what a game, does anybody here or is anybody there? or anybody there, and by the way, they're had to be 15 people there. Yeah. The announcement tenants was 10,000, some of which is a small-ascense built by building. And I saw a little bit, I was watching Lee's game, but I saw a little bit of that game last night, and there was nobody. I mean, there were just sections that were empty. And if there were 3,000 people there, that was a lot. Because basically, for them to put anybody in the building, now they got to be playing a team that's got its own fans, like there were 1,000 or 2,000 Lee fans on Monday, so it was a little bit better than what. But last night, as predicted by yours truly, there was nobody there. Nobody. Oh, there's the G's. And how much you pretty quick? Jake. Donin' for a lot of nails says, what was most beef yesterday? I thought it was sushi, not beef. He started the show, I've talked about some very uninteresting sports stuff. He had every time he used to win it, it was longer than four letters. He felt that he dispelled it. For those listeners from the show that was on before him. Oh, I see. He did this about four times with longer descriptive words, that he probably disassembled on yesterday, then even started definitions for some of the words again for the benefit of those listening to the show that was show was on from 10 to 2. He wasn't acknowledging the name of the show. It looked at trounce your ratings party. Numbers don't lie, Mo. Well, what does that mean? What is she talking about? Trounce your ratings party. I don't know. I think she's applying that we have them, or you have them, and other people don't. Oh. I have no better no with L. I mean, so I'm, and yes, he's getting sorely. I have them. Maybe he didn't have that sushi lunch. Maybe he didn't work out. He says, love that who did Mo? Who did Mo? Oh, for the back of the Nifty Ressolo Slampie White. She's done it. Thanks, Donna, it's a real tweet here from you always. And it says, please wait, and we're not validating anything at the moment. Oh, now it's validating quartiles again. Maybe this is just going to go on all day, you think? So I think I've got to shut it down and try one more time. Oh, yeah, there you go. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And then maybe by the, well, we got the whole weekend coming, you know? Oh, my God. This is a quite an experience. I've never seen nothing like this. But if you think this experience is going to wait to we get these calls on here, man. Can't wait. Tony, Q.A.M. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, Neil Rogers. Speaking. With your computer there, I think what's going on there, you have what's known in the computer world with a ID 10T error. What does that mean? Well, I mean, write it down and then you look it up and you'll explain itself. It's an ID 10T error. I'm sure it's pretty sure that's a 10T error. And what do you do about it? Yeah. Just. What? By doing what? By moving onto another call. Oh. Ha ha ha. It's already. Yeah, it's just please wait and please hang up. It's hit it right on there. It's a please hang up on HMUK. We're a little, this two show past. Tell me Q.A.M. Hello. Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. How did a short folding fat set? Oh, God. You know something, if you would die, it would make us so happy. In fact, he probably kicked him out of Milwaukee, wherever he went off to again. So came back here with his powder and his tail between his legs. Get lost. Jesus, good almighty. WQA, M. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, that lady that ripped the fact. That is true. No Howard was rip it on the audience, I guess. He was talking about a couple things. I mean, it's like, now I know these words maybe too big for the listing audience that was on the previous show. And, uh, good home. Hey, seems pretty, uh, well, I'm tight in here. Pretty ordinary, huh? Yeah, very ordinary. He was, he made reference to it three or four different times. How unusual. Okay, thanks for the good news, sir. Okay. Now that they didn't card files were back to then again. I think we got a, uh, ISP482.6 error. Look it up, look it up in the book. That BFD problem. Yeah, I think we got a BVD problem, okay. Please wait. It says, wait. Now, this has got to be, uh, I don't know. What time did I start at the last time? 45 minutes has been going on. They're about to start at like 20 till there. Because we're not going to take about five minutes to go right to the whole thing. It just, it's just, it's just, it's just, it's just, there and you're going to go through all the files of real real quick. And I was just sitting there like, wow, he just validating card files again, though. This is fun. WQAM, hello. I think it will really sucks. WQAM, hello. A-Neal. Yes, sir. Neo, hey, you know for the, for the movie poll, I can't believe, uh, seven or mentioned. Well, let's add it on there. Okay, we'll get a few votes. Maybe six or seven. The induciate that ending with what's in the box. Come on, I wasn't in the box. Yeah, I was pretty weak. Okay, let's get seven on there. Okay. What's in the box? That was a Brad Pitt's worst moment of all time. I mean, he's had a lot of, a lot of bad movies, but that was maybe the all-time worst. Except maybe the legends of the fall. At least he was still liven in at this one. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Well, if you had any idea how this is just driving me nuts here. I was in the ZM. Yeah, yeah, what are you talking about? Go through his fastic routine of it. And now, do you think that it's gonna like, what's your prognostication? Well, it was 10, 20 that thought it would be. No, I'm not talking about it time. Obviously, that's, that's, that's a slow sense past. But do you think it's actually gonna like finish it? Generally, see, here's the thing that at least, how I am about computer. Yeah, as long as it's doing something. Right. Good. Well, just let you please wait. Yeah, it's fine, I'll be waiting. Yeah, it's fine. I think our files will right. The last came up again. As long as there's some activity, that's a good thing. It's when there's no activity, then that's a bad thing. And you gotta go call it an engineer in your life as over. Oh, no. I just, I wouldn't do that. I just heard out the window. Here's this suggestion for a poll. This is one of our fanges. Probably somewhat weak, but what the heck? Yeah, it is Friday. And we got this technical problem here that I created. I created it because I like, it's fell on that, I put my copy book on the mouse again. I hit like 75,000. It's Friday, you bastard's all, I'll be cute up. And to give it to my thought, well, this reboots a thing like it. It never happened last week, John. No problem. I heard about that. I got a call. No problem at all. I just rebooted it and went through and zipped through all those files. Like that. Beautiful. So you ought to know by now to keep your mouse in the house. Well, but now it's not, but it's taken forever and today, I'd like to get back to abnormal. Anyway, which movie was better than the book was based on? I'd like you said the facts are very weak, very weak. And also, it's just off the topic. It's mototally without a sense of humor. I hear I make fun of certain colors that he says are your listeners, but he doesn't such an unfunny way always trying to be funny. That's hard to listen. And the war of which I think moto arrives unarmed. Oh boy, they're all over the whole mustard. And I guess he's all over our poor colors. See, that's always a good way. I mean, not that I would knock the colors. You do understand that. Great as they are. Who cares? Who cares? But obviously they're listening. That's the important thing. They're glued to the moto, because they want to see who he's ripping and what he's saying and the train monkeys. And Yadia, Yadia, and don't forget about that new cue now. That's a good. Wow, man. Oh, man. Yeah, I'm more of an ordinary play. What the fuck? All this book time of anticipated rules of parks. Ain't nobody ever hired a Jackie Robinson? Sure, rules of parks right on the bus. But Jackie Robinson was an intelligent man and played with bowls and a major league of a children's game. I mean, I mean, come on. Who's done more for the black community? Rules of parks? Or Jackie Robinson? Ha! Jackie Robinson was my hero. Why I can remember when I was a much younger man. And Jackie, he was working at the Jack Full of Nuts. I walked up to him, took his hand at it and said to it, you would. Oh, my hero. Now get the acupacoffee. And make it black. You think Rosa made coffee not heavily? No, I'm not a individual. What do you want? I think what you're doing. Hey, hey, wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Who won't go bowl? Are you a black man? Yes, I can tell of it a photo. Who did more for the black community? Rosa Parks? Or Jackie Robinson? Oh, it's two separate things. What you're doing is blurring the lies between social activism. And not that I'm prejudiced. Oh, he must have been not disconnected through no fault of my own. But at any time, talent you own it a high-thons. Oh no, Lady Bl've what I said! They don't really belong here. Do they please be black the family at the company? No, no. No, stop talking. Where are they going? No. You've got a poor woman, look over here. You know who they are, ... Let's let me watch. Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Oh good boy! Who's a palter? Not a chie. Who's a boy? Who's a boy? Oh no, he's a dog. Who's a boy? Where in palter? For part part. No! Oh, that's not when you're happy. Oh no! He's really shivering. Hey, cut it, take off. Two. Look at me, my old palter. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no. Guess what? Oh no. Holy moly, Batman. Can you believe that? This is one of the most momentous moments. He's cry day, you bestie. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, hey. Oh, hey. Once is enough. I got worried there. That's what started it off. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, oh my god. Oh, oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. oh come on boy. Oh my god, you bestie. Oh right. So we got him. And we've got our huge back, everything is fine. So yeah, totally you're so remained impatient. That's right. So now what you want to do is you want to exit that program by hitting all the 10. Alright. I do want to do one. Yeah. It all 10 the exit the program hit CD backstage to go into your route directory and then do answer. And the interesting to check this in how long it was flashing please wait outside. Okay. Okay. Oh wait, I want all inquiries made. Oh wait, boy, if you had any idea after you did that. I have no idea. What are you talking about? Oh, this is like a crunch to us. I mean, you know, we got a lot of other stuff here. And I got my CD decks. And I got this close to the thing. But that's our lifeline. And we got 84 trillion. And not only we got 84 trillion vits in there. But there's about 20 of them. We actually still play. It's all the right. It's our wife. We're talking about a crunch. It's a job for the month of November. Oh God, please, please stop. Stop. It's a great idea. They use him as a weapon. Talk about a weapon of extra destruction. He's like a weapon. It could be the answer to the head with him. Just let him go away already. Okay, let's, let's, let's, let's, let's be in a good mood for get that he's even there. Cheney has. Most US troops will leave her rack within a year. And the army is broken worn out and may not be able to meet future military threats to the country's security representative John Merthas said there he goes again. Like Reagan would say, there he goes again. Two weeks ago, Merthas created a storm of comment. We call for you all that we know that. Merthas predicted most troops will be out of a rack within a year. I predict he'll make it look like we're staying with course referring to Bush, staying with course is not a policy. Merthas expressed pessimism about a rash to build. He said he recognized who the insurgents are, but don't always share that information with US troops. He said a civil war is likely because of ongoing fascism among the Sunni Arabs, the Kurds and the Shiites. It's just like Joe Eriola and David Sensen and Jeffrey Luria. They hate each other like poison. He also said he was wrong to vote to support the war. I admit I made a mistake when I voted for War, Merthas said I'm looking at the future of US military. Merthas decorated Vietnam more veterans said the Pennsylvania National Guard is stretched so thin that it won't be able to send fully equipped units to Iraq next year. Merthas predicted it'll cost $50 billion to upgrade military equipment nationwide, but says the federal governments already reducing future purchases to save money. I'd be like that. The National Guard is stretched so thin in Pennsylvania. Gazing you're on QM. You don't have any national guards in it because they're all fighting a war in Iraq right now. Not the National Guard. Not the National Guard. No National Guard in Iraq? There's no National Guard myself. See, my call is maybe more on Mova, but at least they know that Big Chuck and the National Guard is in Iraq, okay? Iraq, your Iraq. Lieutenant Colonel Chris Cleaver, spokesman for the Pennsylvania National Guard for Indian Town, Gapset, there were some deployment concerns. We've already said some of your units had to leave equipment in Iraq when they returned to the USA which could cost 20 problems here. But of course there is no National Guard to wreck any waste of what are they talking about. Right. Or that commonly think of propaganda. Let's see, Nate from us Palm Beach is. I was at the game last night. Quite the swelling of fear. All 2000 of us have met, he really enjoyed it. How do you like that? I'm trying to be nice and say there are 3-4 thousand. This guy says maybe 2000. The place looked empty. Look like they had like a bomb scare or something. I got a free ticket in the ever-so-synchie club section. Head section 324 all to myself. empty house. Cheers to sport sports. And my best to go, Nate. How do you like that? Also, here's a pull idea. What mediocre crappy movie that you decided to suffer through turn out to have the best ending. Oh, I don't, don't want to agree with that. Well, can I at least finish reading it before you start interjecting in the scene? I am so excited to have my DCS back. You can only begin to imagine the sugar plums dancing through my head. Use it a lot now. Oh, good. Good. Calling Miss Molly. That is our lifeline. That's our lifeline. I'm hooked up with the two right to my head. Yeah, right connected to the, maybe that's what it was. Maybe I had some bad gants. Got a short of that baby house. That how you input? Oh, output. You input, I'll output. The usual suspects, we've rented this fifth fight club, sixth sense, Tantry, eights, etc. Had the best ending. No, I don't know. I don't think so. No, I don't think so. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I mean, how could a bad movie have a good ending? The only thing, the only thing good. Well, that's true. And every case, if it's a bad movie, the ending is always the best part. Like, all right, that was your story. Exactly. You go out of silver. Oh, man. It's like some shows. Oh, don't, don't. I don't want to mention. How many QAM? Hello. Yeah, I don't like. Pretty good, pal. This is from Mow. How would you sort that as you see K, including? Let's see Russell. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, you wouldn't know. Nifty Russell from Russell Crowe from Bill Russell.

David Haazley or Horseley, whatever his name was, he was a father Mark the Cune man. But today, but Horseley was a real suit of intellectual jackass. A real borish guy, even more borish than I am. Well, you know, those old chestnuts. Yeah, I don't know any about old nuts. But he used to use that. What kind of people used that term? And let's bring back some of those old chestnuts.

We'll see what keep our eye peeled on this. Anyway, also it says the meatloaf is pretty good. I do like meat. Oh, it is. And they have good stuff. But for example, they're driving window. Yeah, that's just for pickup orders. That's called a right. It's not a fast food joint. If you both would drive you have to call a head to pick up your order or order. Lost in market. I never forget the one is, you know, the place that I'm sunrise, it's right in your my, where my bank used to be. And there's a little little building there. It's, I think it's a mattress place now. Okay. It's been like a dozen different things. And it fails no matter what it is. You know, kind of like some people never were in their lesson. They go to business or other places keep feeling that was a Boston market. On sunrise, right over there, like across more best bias. Right. You know what I'm talking about? Yes, I do. And I remember I had a little controversy with that guy with a manager because he got surely with magazine who I was and I made some comment on the year one day about the service that they're being really crappy, which it was. And he made some well, if you got any problem, please grant me first before you. And the problem is that they never know what they want to be. He used to be called Boston chicken and it was Boston market, which was in some terms. And they just, they don't know what they want to be. And I remember everybody was touting it. It was going to be the hottest stock on a stock of staying with Fred. And the food is okay, but they don't know what they want to be like. And they got all these sides 18 different sides. It leveled off now. They've got it together now. Yeah. They took them all the kind of like figure with only one other side. Because I'm not like big on macaroni and cheese. It's, well, you need it for boys. Sure love macaroni and honey. I could eat a bat of their macroni and cheese. And the dining room, in fact, Hank would verify this and the dining room had calmer. All right. And the dining room had a clubhouse. I mean the cafeteria. Okay. Oh, they got good macaroni and cheese. This is the other problem. Very good. So next time you want to, in fact, when you get this check, take the money out there to the track. You have 20, you know, 100, you've got that. Put it all in one horse. Now put it all in the longest shot on the board. And why? And why? And you can not cut 30 to one shot. But 30 man. I'm like 16 to one. Now they're eight to one. I look for some old guy that's dressed really shabbyly and had that. No, look for less or green here. You'd be good to it. Or maybe he couldn't go up in a press box. If you tell your cards right with the hopper, let's go up in a press box and watch him push time, jica, over the edge. Flight logs reveal hundreds of C.I. flights to Europe.

The National Security Agency's released hundreds of pages of long-sequited documents on the 1964 Gulf of Tauke and Incident, which played a critical role on significantly expanding the American commitment to the Vietnam War. The material posted on the Internet overnight when they included one of the largest collections of secret and receptive communications ever made available. The most provocative document is a 2001 article in which an agency is storing our give that the agencies intelligence officers deliberately skewed the evidence passed on the policymakers and the public and to falsely suggest the North Vietnamese ships had attacked American destroyers on August 4, 1964. Based on the assertion that such an attack had occurred, President Lyndon Johnson ordered airstrikes on our Vietnam and Congress passed a broad resolution authorizing military action.

Some 56% of US consumer stink law marks grew as in his bad for America. Quite a way of the international police today by one of the retailers. Most local critics, you see how much you better be happy about now, Mr. Just days before your birthday. A lot. The National Polk Commission by WakeUpWallmart.com, a non-funded group that's been pressuring Walmart to raise employee wages and benefits, surveyed a thousand 12 randomly chosen adults on their attitudes toward the world's biggest retailer. Respondents were asked to choose which of two statements most closely fit their personal opinions. The majority or 56% of the said, I believe that Walmart is bad for America. Just like George W. Bush is bad for America. Just like the Warren Iraq is bad for America. Just like Dick Cheney is bad for America. Just like Julie Rubin is, it may provide low prices, but these prices come with a high more late economic cost for consumers. The 39% agreed at Walmart is good for America and provides low prices and saved consumers money every day. Walmart questioned the timing of the poll, which was conducted in November 15 to 18, weekly made the retailers' critics organized events to highlight their concerns about the company and screened a widely publicized documentary that cast Walmart in a negative and very honest light. The poll is another way for them to wake up Walmart to reach out for something to try to validate their efforts because they had nothing else to hang their head on while March, folks. I'm in Sarah Clark, said, oh yeah, you go, Sarah. Not. Walmart, the largest US private sector employer, faces intense pressure at home from unions, environmental groups and others who say the company pays poverty level wages, offers poor health care benefits and gobbles up green space with its massive big box stores. At the same time, Walmart is defending a record large class action lawsuit that charges it with discriminating against women and paying promotions. But you hate to Walmart, we hope that you die. Yeah, you like that. I like it a lot. We hate to even worse than the city manager hates the Marlin organization, those carpet beggars. Planned to allow citizens on planes opposed, I just can't get over that. And the public sits back like, oh, that's it. I think we don't have to go drill through all our bags again. In fact, this movie last night, a very quick scene of it was in LAX and the airport and the movie's cellular. The hotel nearby. Right. And the guy very cleverly, he put into a gun into the other guys' bags so that it was stop and then it come to turn out to fight out that the other guy was a cop. So I asked his LA page, I'm LA PD, I'd leave me alone, he grabbed his gun. And it was a story about crooked cops. Do we have journalists on the payroll? I might like a story like that. It was okay, if it comes on, I wouldn't pay to watch it, but if it comes on, it'll be fun about it. That's all like a piece of it, but that's a lot. We're combasing your end, William H. Macy, and then this punk whatever his name is, he's marginal. But it's pretty good. You will understand though, if you see it, my complaint about the fact that they can't make up their mind, but it wants to be a serious movie or comedy. Now, yeah, there's like some of the hitchhiking movies had a little bit of comedy in them, but that's different. But that's slightly a comedy. We've had a cart-chase, not a serious cart-chase, but like a silly cart-chase. It just, I don't know, it didn't fit in. But it was okay. I'm a scale of five, I get like a three-and-a-half. It's not too bad. In fact, it had three stars on the thing that I had on the crawl on my cable, three stars. Or the reason I watched it. I haven't heard my lesson yet. I keep getting sucked in by the stars. A proposal of a lost small scissors and tools back on our airliners has drawn a stride opposition from Platytenus, families of victims of the 9-11, and several lawmakers. Transportation Security Administration Chief Kip Holly was expected to outline the proposal today as part of a broader shift in airports security. The plan would allow airline passengers to carry scissors less than four inches long, and rents isn't screwed, drivers less than seven inches long. So if you've got a screwed driver or the real sharp end on it, that's only six and a half inches long, it's A-okay. Yeah, just top that they be out and stick it in your bag. Okay. Yeah. In that ridiculous. Yep. In other words, a screwed driver does like seven and a half inches long. How much more dangerous is that than a screwed driver does like six inches long? And what do you need to be taking a screwed driver on your trip for anyway? Oh, you know, just to see. It's one thing to be drinking a screwed driver in first class, but to be taking a one in your goods representatives Ed Markey of Mass and Joseph Crowley of New York City, they didn't intend to produce an introduced abil to preserve the current prohibition on Sharfs' users, tools, and knives, and airliner cabins. Thank God for them. You crazy people of TTSA? The Vorsal Administration proposal is just asking you the next time I have an autopsy move from box cutter to scissors as the weapon that's used in the passenger cabin to planes mark he said. Holly has complained that airports Queeners spend too much time confiscating small orders from innocent passengers. He wants them to focus instead on searching for what the TSA views is a more serious threat improvised bombs on a bomb agrande or pecania, whatever. Like the one at Kerala soldiers in Iraq yesterday, just pathetic. Airlines generally support the plane, so as the pilot's largest union, the airline pilot's association. Bob Hesselbeen, the Union's National Security Committee chairman said pilots think it's more important to focus on passengers in 10th, rather than what they're carrying. Then we ought to have a psychic at every screenings fund every airport, right? What's your intent? What are you going to do with that screwed driver? What are you going to do with that little swish blade? A swish army after the briefcase of a frequent fly, we know very well as a tool Hesselbeen said, a ballpoint 10 in the hands of a terrorist is a weapon. So I got to do an idea when we just ban terrorist on planes. I was just thinking that same thing. Yeah, that was a problem. Is there a, we know what they're thinking? My grandpa feels he says not $200 like you all were thinking. How does he know what they were thinking? He says he though that and the information he always does that. When he gives you the low price of his rotisserie oven, not $350 like a in the stores, not $200 like most of you must probably think it. It's a formula, man. He's got that thing down to a science, pedaling crap. TSA screeners this year, loan of confiscated 12.6 million prohibited items, including 3 million chart objects, quantity, homeland security department, and we know how, we know how they're right on top of it. They've also taken away 8.1 million lighters the only item prohibited by law. You can take that one day saying they've 16 pass the matches, but not the old fashion time. What do they call the old fashion kind of big matches? A wooden knight head in the box, the wood matches. Isn't there a name for those like a blue dot? Blue, blue, blue, a blue diamond. Okay. Speaking of a kira Phillips and the blue diamond Phillips, blue diamond. Isn't that it? Not the brand name? Blue diamond. I think over the weekend, I'm going to go out and sell some moreton salt. I think we feel like a kid again. You ever have to do that in school to run some moreton salt? No, that sounds strange. They've had to go door to door and sell moreton salt. No, they made a sell candy. Yeah. But that's salt. That's what they do now. That's strange to me. Well, that's better for you. Candy yourself. See, this is another ass salt I'm looking at. I'm looking at American youth. That's why all the kids are fat. Like poor, I wasn't a name like Hallie Berry's fat, Trubby Kidder, and a movie. That was sad. He was so hit or problem. He did. Wow, he had a dysfunctional life, okay? He had no daddy. And mommy was like, hand him off and she was always on a verge of getting evicted. Which eventually did. And so I think that was a perfect ending when I sat on the porch. Oh, Jesus, I shouldn't say they sat on the porch. 113 a QAS. This is Neil Rogers. He was still. Oh, double y'all.

We've made the transition already from the movie endings that you hated like Poison to the fast food that you like a little bit. Or maybe a lot. Wendy's, oh, there's that fascist John Agrapada that butcher. Wendy's 56. All fast food blows 38. That seems to be moving very fast. Poit or tropical 36. Stake in shake. 32. Maybe now maybe their burgers are falling apart now, Mom. Let me pass out of try. Maybe I would go over there and get a little sack. Too far. Too far. Well, you know, when you go to drive through normally you're bringing it home or something like that. Yeah. Oh, well, what do you mean? Normally you're bringing it home. Well, I guess if I was there, I would go to stay and shake. I'd bring it home because I'm a bread around a corner. But for you, eat it on a way home. Right. Have to sell for one of your ear. Have a soda in one hand and then about to sandwich his ear mouth. Valver, rise on my knee. Right. Stake in shake 32. Taco Bell 26. I hate this pool 25 and that's climbing up there. I wouldn't be surprised if all fast food blows and I hate this pool. They wind up one, too. I would not. I mean, I would not be surprised. It ends by. Where's that? I'm. Subway 18, Chick-fil-A 16, Miami, Sub 15, Papai's 14, RB 12, McDonald's 11, and W nine, KFC 7, Chekers 6, Churches chicken five, pizza Hut 3, Burger King 3, and Crystal Saliment Day dose. And that's because there's only the one I believe in. So I'll flow her. That I know it. But there are no power line or something like that. Subway. Remember how it is? I need to find out. In German. I, is number one, I, Tried, but like if you order, I never really paid that much attention to the way the German sick. Because I don't want to make a total fool of myself. I'm ordering like a brat worst. What do you say? I, in scrap worst, you say I. I would have said, but I'll ask John Gers. Yeah, he would know. He's a real crow. He, oh, he is. He's a real star crow. And proud of it. Pilot reports missile fired a jetliner near L.A. X. Remember that plane that caught Shackdown? I mean, that crashed the TWA. What was it? 800? What was the flight? There was an eight in there somewhere. I think we'll see W 800. That the crash they said, but a beep, a loop, but about. And then there were all those, that's several witnesses said they saw a missile hit it. Yeah, and then there was that book that came out that I bought. And I talked about and the book disappeared. You couldn't find it no more. Remember that? F. B. I. H. Isons and Homeland Security officials spent the weekend last week. And investigating the report of a possible missile. And this story is just coming out now in today's, where is this KYW Philadelphia? F. B. I. H. Isons and Homeland Security officials spent the weekend. Last week, investigating the report of a possible missile fired at an American Airlines plane. And I think this is why that one was actually coming out from L.A. X. Sources tell ABC News, the pilot of American Airlines flight. 621 on Routes, Chicago, radio and air traffic controllers after take off from L.A. X. He told him a missile had been fired at the aircraft and missed. The plane was over water when the pilot said he saw a smoke trail pass by the cockpit. F. B. I. is his belief was a flare or a bottle rocket, but they say they may never know exactly what it was. And of course this is the holiday travel and season Josh's going to see it all. I'm going across the pond you're probably gonna be flying home. I'm looking for that check. Right. So I'm saying grab a seat. We don't have to do it. We don't have to do it. But that would be something. I don't think they never tell us the truth. No, of course not. Because that would really, that would never put big kibash on. The airline industry is already on this last leg. And they're all either in chapter 11, 12, 13, 15, whatever. Their off-source is the Chinese say. They got issues. Look at this. Connecticut attorney generals on there, participating about this, a conference up there. And we're, hopefully, removing our attorneys from those court houses. Exactly where you located. You and New Haven, which city you went. My office is in Hartford, but it has lawyers all around the country. Several court houses shut down after a, specific threat of Connecticut. You can use those activities. I wonder if I have something to do with old Julie Romano and the public. I've been evacuated as well. I'm sure Wayne Sanford. I don't know if you know who he is, but then. Oh, he is. We are for the Department of Homeland Security in Connecticut. Sanford is also a notice that the bomb threats were actually cold into the court houses. Did you receive that information? Oh, my God. They were bomb threats unspecific threats made this morning. By telephone to the governor's office apparently. None of this information has been confirmed. Okay, Greg, well, when you will find out, you'll just keep your nose in it. Okay, just keep, keep sticking in there. What's our goal on the second player? 400, we got 354. We get to 400 by the top of the hour. And we'll all take it the next couple of weeks off. What do you say? All right. And then I got news from, I'm about 70 cent of me a check. That's a good idea. But I think everybody out there ought to send me a big fact check. For my birthday was not long. I was November 5. It's not too late. Birthday card would be a little bit late at this point. It's kind of a little warm. But if I check, how? It's a good idea. For my birthday would be good. Or for your new go and Christmas. For all the heathen holidays, whatever it might be. How about at least a 1500 for a start? This is no more. Roger this. What do we have? This is 5. 16. 8. George Bush doesn't care about black people. Absolutely. Don't do it. She came around and closed the other books away. Carry private and though have put dreams. Carry private and though make you the rocker's name. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. The world is so beautiful. Two things I'm pretty about that. That's a very important thing. That whole Harry Potter thing just drives me up the wall. Flip it to the show. You can sew all the crap in fact. It is the easier the cell is. Look at us. All this intellectual crap. All this important stuff. We don't care about that. We want to hear it in a bridge standard. We want some naked pictures. We have naked pictures. We have a gender renewal. Did you hear our cats and hear us speaking of planes? We're about it. Five, six, seven, five, six, six. I can't say. I want to see if anybody else speaks to them. I want to see if anybody else speaks to them. I want to see if they're in. What? Why is that? A brought worst. If you're only ordered. No. You said you say on instead of one. I mean, would you take a letter off because you're. So the sentence that way, and English, it's that way in Spanish. I was in Italian. When you ordered a singular object. Do you want to tell me about my favorite fast food restaurant? Yeah. If that Korean restaurant called Greyhounds. Yeah. I'm going to write that down so I can laugh at it later. Yeah. That's, you know, Italian. Uno. Uno, do it. Uno pizza. Uno, uno pizza. Uno pizza. I beg of pardon, you don't say, oh, well, instead of. Uno pizza? Well, so I want, if you want, like, one pencil, un lobis. So I meant, uno, espinna. Don't you remember that? Only one stone in your shoe. I don't think that's been a mean stone. I don't know. I was like, that's like a thorn. That's what the, or thorn in my side. So uno, espinna. That was a bad scene. So I was a good scene in a campway, because that was some of the worst acting, you know, I walked and blew me, that covers a lot of territory. And I'm moving. The other piece was in the Atlantic City, and it would be for the big hit in the Atlantic City. I thought we could leave the government. He's waving his arms like, uh, uh, braw. It was so bad. It was surreal. Like, they actually put this in a camp in the, uh, when you put this in the film, or these outtakes, you know, like, with coke in my brain. There. Well, this was going on. But the scene where he's visiting his old friend. He's saying the states, my ace in the hole. Remember that? Mm-hmm. The, whoever wrote the script, the dialogue. Okay. Can't you see these tools, the scenes? You're my ace in the hole. Yeah, right. Or maybe just an ace hole. We can say that. For no. Yeah. In fact, why, why not? I think I just solved that problem. I think ace hole is just fine. It's a line from Godfather 3, if anyone would like a choice. Ace hole. W to Q a m line. Hello. Q a m. Oh, hey, I got a good Taco Bell story for me. Yeah. Can I talk to him? You talk to him. No, but, uh, I used to work at Fort Amber Delay that a shipping company several years ago. We had a refrigerated cargo containers that came in. And that, they said there were something wrong. Something wrong with the refrigeration unit. We got to open up the container to look at it. The boxes were marked. Taco Bell, you had the great e-brett edible. Yeah. I guess I think I just think I just changed my lungs plants. Ha ha ha ha. Oh. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 10. I probably were sure Wendy's. And Pomp 5, uh, 60, only Verizon's thinking of wireless lines. Ice. Try. Dry. The only thing we have to fear is fear. Right. W to Q a m. Hello. Hey, what's up? How you doing, sir? Good man. It's a real quick blue. You're not having to me. You don't speak your mind. No, no, I was sure, but for me, bro. This and real quick, I got to speak back and to work. I want to both. I don't think that way, but we've got to both conference. Right. Right. And center. I have a seat of the rate. Wow. I don't know. He doesn't swing that way. Yeah. That's what Louise told about. What's your name, too? Mariah. He's really scary. I know. Amazing. Somebody's brought you. Just don't get the message. I mean, even we know about Louise. So can his predliction. But not Mariah. She was around. You said that. Oh, speak of that South Africa. To have gay weddings. South Africa's highest court is ruled in favor of same sex marriages, which are banned under court legislation. He constitutional court order that parliament amend marriage to what I'll gay weddings within a year and South Africa. All you have for coolers. You have to learn about what I've said. Everybody's the seheners. You have some things. So it's. Thank you. So it's. It's. And I have faith. They say there's got 2 things. Because out of that same Court it moved the Mayor's you have.

So while you are, so that's the choice. You need to come up here to Toronto. Or you can go up the road to Kingston in Ontario. It's good to be a good Kingston boy. Don't sure you'll talk about your on the coaches corner. So tire to him. We've got him. I'm going to tire to him. That's still old act. Tragic. How are we doing on that 400 votes on the pool? Let's see. 387. I mean, this is not even a contest. It's good thing I picked 400. You know what? Seattle had to pick my numbers. And you know, and my nose. And I know, I don't believe you. I listen to both of you. I still don't believe you. All right. Whatever. I got a great story about a bird like animal with dinosaur feet. Did you see this? No. It's about the archiopteryx. I was just telling you about archiopteryx the other day. Well, I got a story about it. And I'm going to do the break. And when we come back up, I'll tell you all about it. It's Skeleton of the Archiopteryx. Let's say reversed it. To a tracetron in current birds. So all you, uh, even with design people out there, all you God squad folks, guess what? You follow crap. Everybody knows it. And quit trying to come into the back door. They got a name for that. Okay. What they say? This is Neil Roger. That's him. This is 5. 62. A. That's him. That's him. That's him. Well, close. And soda. The bill. Oh, show. And pink is a call. Says we've asked the employee you to for us at the word of most popular best of such eyes. But that's not all he's doing. Don't see what we mean at the beginning. I'll have a notorious B.I.G. mask and IT with an IT. What's up, I see. We're there. We're there. That's your. I did drive by the second window. The city is all that and the bag of cheese. Well, we don't sell no chips. But we do have bread fries on our values. They use for all this. Because it's a much love of choosing these days. Here's your order. Can I get it? Yeah, yeah. Not can I get it. Here. Yeah. No matter what you want. Or up above our grill. There's a big city. It's because immediately locate the region. That goes. Yeah. All right. All right. I'm 43. I'm working on that. All right. You working on it all the time? OK, we got over 400 votes. We can relax on it. It's a stupid ass pool. 405. And we got like 17 minutes to go. So no problem. I do like that. I can't stand. But you know what's going to win that, don't you? Oh, yeah. You know who? You're president. Not mine. You're president. Thank you. A new and analisational of archiopteryx. The earliest known bird-like animal shows it had feet like dinosaurs. The fighting that's supposed to believe that the bird-screening backyard feeders today are descendants of money, ancient carnivores. While not all scientists agree, many consider our archiopteryx the first bird since it had wings and was the first fossil found with feathers. Details have been lacking on the animals. However, since only a few fossil specimens have been found, the new one reported in the last Friday's issue of the year. Maybe today's issue. This is the day's. Today's issue of the journal's science is the tenth known in one of the most complete. It's got a picture of it here. Contrary to what have been thought the new fossil shows that the first tow was not reversed in archiopteryx. As is the case, I'm current birds. According to a team led by Gerald Mayer, or our research institute, Shakenberg, in Frankfurt, Germany, Einstein, et cetera. Like at the reverse tow, what half of the animals ability to personalize current birds, or research, you said, on the other hand, it's second tow could be extended like those of Therapeut. Beast-footed dinosaurs, a group that excluded such well-known examples is T-rex. Oh, let's play some T-rex. Archiopteryx was considerably smaller, however close to the size of a man pie. Oh, remember the man pie? What about him? What though was the man-named of the man pie? Hechel and Jekyll and what was it? McCarty. Ah, heckle and Jekyll, here. What I just tell you. The new example lived about 150 million years ago and what is now above Veria. And God, the while I love that Bavarian cream pie. Oh, God. I want to face them and close to Denys. Probably. And I don't think they do the mother-humber pie anymore, Denys, do I? I don't know. Remember, I had that episode. And I had a talk about Denys. Matthew T. Carano, a dinosaur-rex-word-ethy Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History agreed that the discovery supports those who consider birds to be descendants of dinosaurs. The lack of a reverse tow doesn't mean an archiopteryx couldn't sit in a tree, but probably indicated it was not a habitually tree-living animal. We assume it could fly, but we don't have a lot of information about flying ability. Most of the known specimens are partial, so the new one answered knowledge of the animal she said. And there's a picture of it right here, but favorite fossil. Is it really? I'll be in here. I thought I would. That y'all agreed. Wall green disciplines for pharmacists. I might have to not make a lie check for a while. Oh, you got a fossil yet? You all have to do, think. Wall green company, Denysians, largest rugs to are chained by Revenue Senate's put four Illinois pharmacists in the St. Louis on Unpaid Leave for refusing to fill prescriptions for emergency contraception violation of state rule. There we go with, you know, that thing about rules gone wild? Yeah. I'm going to make a write a book called Goiom Gone Wild. Because that's what America is all about today. It's just, they're just out of control. The four-sided religious or moral objections to filling prescriptions for the morning after filling have said they would like to maintain their right to be used to dispense in an Illinois. That's not an option while we're in spokesman Tiffany Bruce said. She probably can't do Gary Bruce. A rule imposed by Governor Black and Joe Bitz, whatever his name is, and April, requires that Illinois pharmacies that spell contraceptives have proved by the U.S. Food and Government Station to fill prescriptions for emergency birth control. Pharmacies that do not fill prescriptions for any type of contraception are not required to follow the rule. So what's good for the goose is good for taking a gander. Ed Martin and attorney for the pharmacists on two they called this one pretty disturbing and said that we're considered legal action if law Greens doesn't be considered. Well, you mama. At least six other pharmacists have sued over the rule planning of forces them to violate the religious police. If you're religion prov... and let's say I don't believe in blood pressure medicine, okay? I mean, what kind of crap is that? Well, the jove is what? This is don't believe it or any of it. Yeah, so it's probably not a good idea for them to be pharmacists. Or the seventh day of Venice in Venice. Or whatever kind of other furritails you're inventing this week. And one, isn't that guy's name Joseph Smith? I got it's getting fried. Right. I heard that girl over in West Coast. He just came back. Joseph Smith is the guy in Palmar when the York who found the tablets. That's right. Right. And he said take two of Carlisir in the morning and put make some of the babies in the morning. And that was the founding of the Mormon Church. The Church of Latter-day, but whatever the hell it is. That whole business, it makes me gag. All you religious nuts, when you're going to wake up and sit the coffee, okay? Smith, the coffee. You see that commercial they keep showing you year after year about that punk. He's probably 80 years old now. He comes home obviously from college or something for the holidays, for Christmas. And he seeks in the house in the morning. Blue girl comes downstairs. Oh, Tommy or whatever his name is. Ace is a line of how to wake you. Everybody up. He goes and makes the Maxwell house coffee or whatever coffee. You ever saw that? Nope. And they've been one of that every Christmas for the last 75 years. And that it must be a hundred years old. I'm in for a treat this year then. No. So, 419 votes. Time to sniff, wake up and sniff up and wake it. God and chew it. I still don't believe you guys by the way, you're lying. All right. I didn't tell on the ear that horrible stir. This is a little bit too gross, but nevertheless it's part of life, you know. I go to the ATM. This is before I went to a woodbinder then. I go and take out or maybe I'll always be far went to Niagara Falls for the weekend, a plunge. So I want to take out some extra cash. So I go to where my bank is and I go to the ATM. Which is inside like a place. And I kept out the numbers, you know, I'm the money is coming out and I look down. I realize I hadn't seen them when I hit the buttons.
