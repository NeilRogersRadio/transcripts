There's one walker in Gary Faiton. This is the most disgusting program. That's a great one. Everyone to complain to this station. In theaters, this Halloween from the director of Night of the Middead. You can't tell the unbed, silly. George Bush stars in. I know the human being and this can cause just peaceful in nights of the middding brain dead. In my state of the Union, our state, my speaks to the nation. Where we want calling too many OBGYNs or enable the practice there to live with women. Your single mother with two children. You're working hard to put food on your family. Our is our children learned. George Bush and Night of the Middding Brain dead. Who only wants shame on shame on you? It's who we can't get food again. And of course don't forget to always love a little. Robert Garret. That one too. Another dead, the US soldier in Iraq just in. I can't even keep track of these fast enough. And we got to 2000. There was going to be this big and a couple of real protests in people marching and anybody paying any attention. Oh, no. Camping the bloodiest month for American troops in January, the military reported yesterday that seven, now make it eight more US service members were killed. By increasingly sophisticated bombs that had become the deadliest weapon in the insurgents arsenal, I thought the insurgents were waiting. Or is that just out of the window? It's way dead throws. That's what it is. bombs also claimed to tell Monday amongst civilians in Bazaar Iraq's second largest city in the major metropolis of the sheer dominated South. A large car bomber exploded along a bustling street when a bomb agrande packed with shops and restaurants as people were enjoying and evening out after the daily aromad on fast. At least 20 were killed in 40 wounded. Other than that, things are going very well. Military commanders of war that soon the insurgents will step up their attacks in the rob today December 50th election when Iraqis will choose their first full-term problem since the collapse of rotten son. I like that. And our things are going so damn well. Anyway, the war I'm getting is that the Humphrey will be back tomorrow and we couldn't I guess you couldn't do the shows from Vegas because they couldn't get an engineer out of the stack of 330 in the morning and he would have to use his own headphones. I don't know what to do with this. When you thought they would set one of our engineers out there would probably be just dying to go to Vegas. Yeah, they're actually going to go ahead and you know. I'll do it. Everyone. But probably our engineers had bigger fish to fry the keep in the sun here. Thanks a lot guys. You're pretty weak at best but during these difficult times you're doing a great job. Aren't they? And stuff came into your yesterday got our phones back up. Let's see. Oh, see that? Ooh, a nice thing. Oh, I'll read it. Punch up line one. I thought I heard a buzz all day yesterday on that. There it is. Oh, it's just line one's got issues. You know, you should know. Line one has to go to quick disconnect. Anyway, the Spanish language thing that Bow was talking about and that you were informing me before. Right. A little history on that as one who's been on here for 700 years in this market. 790. That frequency used to be of course WNWS. Why should I don't have anything from there? You know, I don't have my old theme song, more by K-Winding. Charles, I think I use that on K-E-T. Right, said. So anyway, we're kicking our ass with the old farts with all the geriatric send WDS news. We got those huge numbers. And all of a sudden, I remember what your was. After the Mario Bolif. I think maybe it was like 81. Was the Mario Bolif, and 80? Yes. So this is about 81. I do believe all of a sudden one day, I'm in the car. And just like always, management couldn't hear it for the first couple of days. It wasn't too loud. It was kind of like this. And we got the Fidel cranked up about 100,000 watt AM since he doesn't pay any attention to international broadcasts or any other laws. So he has whatever he wants. And he had an old station that he cranked up on 790 that just basically gives the time and a temperature and just all its therefore interference purposes. And so that really screwed up our signal. Even during the daytime, and especially the further south and baby would go, we like to be a sit in downtown Nevada. And then at night time, it was kind of like a sort of a personal like our signal. Yeah. So I guess now that they're off the air, but at least we've met the report we're getting. But we've reported. They have the radio, the reason we're getting the report from inside the building is our people are the only ones who listen to that station. So it would be the ones who would know. Because these hour by hour, this is, hey Joel, I'm going to say this is very impressive. Oh, is there a number you ought to be very familiar with? So this is, you need to be your thing, sir. Yes. Pretty gay. Oh, yeah. More by K-Windy, so the new kid Mando County. Hello, I'm moving. I'll move if you're here. I said, do you believe that? Anyway, oh, yeah. I used that as a theme and got only those how many places are 100 yards. So wait, goes. Okay, let's get serious now, okay. Got a lot of stuff to pass along. Good news is George doesn't have power or cable. Yeah, that's the greatest. And we also had cable in the station there for about two or three minutes, and then it's just a false alarm. It was on. And then it was off, just like that. But it would be, oh, no, it's easy to announce it in his verps loop plans. Check out our own feedback. How about, hey, how about, it's not everybody. I'll book our, where we'll be safe, yeah. South Florida is in no mood for rain, the sun's setting. Well, says boy, they are on top of the situation. I think they have got their film right in it, not on it, but in it. Just the same, the forecast calls for a 60% chance of showers and possible thunderstorms is it raining right now? Probably. It is here. It's murky and dripping a little bit. Leafs of beta panties to one last night. It could be wrong about that, but I'm sure I've seen it my own two eyes on the fast forward. Leafs to and the panthers on passes via Montreal to play Le Caradien Le Everthan Tonight, the frogs. And we'll have that with Gildi and the Silly Red Dear Randy. Anyway, the forecast calls for a 60% chance of showers and possible thunderstorms today and tomorrow. Oh, my God. We'll get into the misery of those with damage roofs. I'd like this when it rains at porous. It's not going to be a flooding rain, but if you have a leaking, you roof any amount of rain can feel like flooding rain said meteorologist Rob Handell of the National Weather Service in Miami. Most of the regions have seen less than a half an inch of rain that resulted in a warm front moving north from Cuba. Oh, great. Well, the service said maybe it's also bringing that signal up from Maraudio 7. I mean, whatever that is. Potentially, the front could produce heavy rain tomorrow. The stars over South Florida, but it should drift north possibly to Orlando. Eric, look out to rain's coming Eric. Craig Fugut. Well, I hope I said that. Right. Hope so. Florida's director of emergency management urge residents were licking roofs to buy tarps and home improvements doors rather than wait for the government to issue them, which he said will be completed by seven years from Sucus. So don't wait. People don't have to wait until we can provide a tarp for them. He said, so what do you, uh, that's a lot of things for everybody to get online for, right? Yeah. So, what are your home depot and wherever else and line up and buy tarp? After the front passes, after the temperatures expected the climate of the mid to high 80s, that too is lousy news for people with no power or AC George. Although George has got the generator, I'm sure you got your AC gone. No, no, we don't. You don't? Well, because first of all, we have individual units. I mean, we could plug one or more into it, but what's the point? It's easier to just open the house up and cool the whole thing up. Okay. So far another one. Another clear is the good news for it. Then another cold front was derived by Thursday because you sure is how we won't have power by then, but shouldn't be strong enough to lower temperatures. Rather, it should reduce humidity in the rain chance that meteorologist Tom Warner. It'll eliminate a lot of them. Muggie air, that's by Thursday. So just hold on loosely or hold on tight. Whatever makes you feel better. No strong cold front. Similar to the one that followed Hurricane Wilmer expected to cool off the region until at least next week. The National Hurricane Center was monitoring a tropical wave. Oh my God. That was a South and Puerto Rico yesterday. That system is not, thank, it says here, thanks God. That system is not expected to develop. Aren't you thankful for that? Yeah, yeah. Well, Hollywood doesn't seem to be doing too well in the power area. Here's the revised numbers as of six o'clock this morning from Florida, Plunderland, Lou. I didn't hear a bow again. They're toward the Ascent of that show us. Kissing up to them. Do they want one? With him. I don't understand. Maybe he has a power again. Do you think that's it? Or at his house? Or at his house? Or at his house? No, he knows he does not. I'll say he doesn't have power. Maybe he figures if he sucks around, nothing like his power back. And doesn't work, believe me. I'll tell you right now. Rip him an ass. Then all of a sudden it comes down like magic. All magic you say. How's Tom Hamlin doing those numbers? Boy, speaking numbers, man. Is, no, what are they? I think they just shut the transfer down to save juice over there. They must have seen the same hourlys that fed boy. You'll find, thanks for that boy for the info that he sent to us. It must have seen that. And if he was the use, God, almighty. They're talking about a dismal failure. Anyway, here's the FPL numbers as a six this morning. And only the counties that we care about, right? It's where everybody else. Broward, 310,500 are still up. But 550, 2000 traded are back on. Watch your, everybody else. But you're one of the third of a million people still waiting and waiting. Here is eight days after that. And we'll move past you a week ago yesterday. And you're still waiting. And I'll be the last one. My block will be the last block. Where do you see anywhere near you? You see like, light on, all the way around is unshared. Right on the outside of the highway. Three blocks to the east and five blocks to the south. So in other words, he just singled you up apparently. Like they always, they probably Greg told them where you live. Maybe man might not. My buddy Greg. Yes, that one. They've counted 210,900 people are still with no luck. But 745,600 customers, they're a frying at man. They got it. They're sticking their finger in the socket. They're so excited to have it back. And in Palm Beach County, a mere 179,700 are still without. And 480,800 are restored. And we're supposed to say great job. You know, we say great job that the workers, of course. But not to FPL. They just make me gag as usual. They may not be good, but at least they're consistent. Consistently slow and lagging about it. Before we do anything else, and they got more stuff about the hurricane and about the roofing and stuff like that. And the cable. Yeah. I have to interject this now because it's a, it makes me feel good. All right. Check about the brits. You know, I'm always ripping the brits about how constipated they are emotionally in about how pasty and how the bad teeth and a whole deal. But at least they're some saving grace. More Britain's believe in ghosts than in God, according to an informal survey published Monday of over 2000 people completed the questionnaire. 68% said they believed in the existence of ghosts and spirits. Maybe fairies. That's what an e, of course, F.A.E. We're on the air. Failet. Fairies. They believe in that while 55% said they believed in the existence of God. So 68% believe in ghosts and spirits. And only 55% said they believe in God. Not even God. They'll God. The Halloween survey was carried out by retailer choices UK. But since it wasn't a random sample, it's findings don't necessarily represent a statistically valid robber of British opinion. Some 26% said they believed in the existence of unidentified flying objects while 19% believed in reincarnation. Just 4% admitted believing that the Loch Ness monster was more than a myth. Maybe he's kind of myth America. A close of believing in ghost 12% said they actually had seen an apparition in 76% said that TV reality shows about the supernatural of films like these spooky Blair witch project had played a part in convincing them that ghouls exist. Oh, that shows how easy they are, right? We want to believe in ghosts more than ever in our far more likely to take the word of ay reality documentary or convincing movie than here say we're 18 ghosts stories. Choices UK's books in David Ritz said they have it right. Seek it with our own eyes helps feed our imagination makes the unbelievable, believable. It makes the unfeelable, believable. In fact, I could do that. Mix the unfeelable. Unfeelable. Unfeelable. Didn't work right. Mix the unfeelable. Feelable. You're right. There is quite a way. That was a labor of love.

I never knew that, of course, how else? It's internet based? You know, there's either a phone line or something like that Where, um, when I know now a phone line doesn't mean internet based I thought it was like just on a phone thing Just like when they call if, you know, if you steal somebody else's credit card And they call and say, oh, we're going to keep your card But have a listen, it's a computer transmission Whether it's using a phone line or a cable and some people don't have that I see because of the wires.

This is great. If you've got a business and you want to let people know that you're open and you want to make a few bucks after a week of real grief. I'm telling you man, I mentioned that yesterday and nobody's really writing enough about that. They've been one or two little teeny tiny articles. See, the newspapers don't have to worry because they publish a video all over the Imagine a lot of people cancel their ads or at least, you know what I mean post-bomem. But it doesn't put a beautiful page ads in when you store it's closed to the or your restaurant or whatever it might be or your restaurant like Pomp and O Park and the others. A lot of damage to Gulf Stream too and in like a lot of way from finishing that construction. They got some real issues over there. Do you have any QAM? Hello. Yes. Yes sir. I'd like to talk to Neil about the gas. Speaking. Speaking. I wanted to know why I'm talking to these gas stations about subsidizing their generator. What is subsidization been buying for a long time with the way they've been gouging us as it is? Right. Well, I guess those record $1 billion profit. You know, maybe the folks at the Exxon and the other big guy and Chevron. Maybe they could afford a few bucks for generators. I mean, maybe just that maybe just that stock in gas companies like his brothers. Speaking of that, you'll be very pleased to know that you're a secretary of defense, run for a run. Comey, run. He's got enormous amount of stock in that drug. Yeah. Yeah. But did you just say you're the only company in the United States that actually makes it as being sold to a foreign investor? Now we're not going to have any. You don't have to get your money. If they make a you contact with the run for a run. You're going to have to stay up over to his joint. Where is the question when we have to eat you or they get a hold on to a You don't ask too many questions, man, because they'll come and get your ass. Good luck to you, pal. All right. Don't ask any questions. Thinking of generators, it was just brought to my attention in a Harold article. You know, people will be a mercy for the cost of a generator. But only if you were an unprepared shrub and waited until your power went out to buy one. If you were prepared like some of us and bought your generator before the hurricane. They won't reimburse you. They will not. And you're saying, well, I'd call him a right now. Tell you, mama. Yeah. Well, you mama's so sucks in hell. That's what I would tell him. Bastards. God, almighty. What kind of a country are you people living in for Christ's sakes? Man, it used to be, I can remember when the US was the greatest country in the world. Now all of a sudden, they stole that election in 2000, everything went to hell. Then we had buildings falling and we had all this all kinds of crap going on. Gas, three and a half bucks a gallon. And people dying needlessly enough for a fully war based on lies. And people have it like a B and that didn't resign from the White House because the fact they are a lie part of a conspiracy. They're covering up to the old smear and smear conspiracy. I've been telling you that for a long time, Paul O'Neill, he wrote that book and all of a sudden, well, he used some confidential classified information in there and Paul, you better watch out and keep your mouth shut. We're going to fry your ass. Remember that? Yeah. But after his book came out, right? And of course, you know, it was a pile of crap anyway, but nevertheless, they sure shut. Don't see him no more. They shut him up good. Schmear and Schmear. Just like Cindy Sheen. Here's a woman lost her kid in the Iraq and a needless war. She's got the co-holms, unlike most of the Democrats, to go around a country, screaming bloody murder and getting a whole bunch of other people involved. And smear her ass too. You know, why do I do that? And use that faggot there or my me, please try to wait to help do it. That misfludge. I'm going to tell you, if you see him just take a basic member of the movie, Ms. Ree with James Connecante, but with the Marquis Necaps. Ms. Fudge. I'm encouraging anybody that encounters him under beach. Get a aluminum bat from the hurricanes and go ahead and just break his kneecaps. And make them understand the kind of panties and clicking self-hitting mighty cone. You're free or idiot. You're quizzing. You're simple to just like yesterday. It is a big news on there about this new Nazi day got that they won on the Supreme Court Samuel Alito. And he's got the tear jerk in the story about all the Republicans are all upset because the Democrats are calling him Scolito. And it's an ethnic thing, you know, with like Scolia and his name combining, which has nothing to do with ethnic and has to do with political philosophy as in fascism. You're quizzing. You idiot. You're fair. Like I said, how does it feel to look in the mirror every day you bald-headed geek with your silly head? Every lies your a total sellout 40 Fagdue. Huh? This is Neal Roger. This is 5.16. What is this? What is this? A monk. Numbers and blind justice comes another exciting tale of a different way of an able client fighter. I'm an excellent detective. Yeah. I'm an excellent detective. This is Wayne Man, P.I. This is the first getting away. What? After a... I'm an excellent driver. Wayne Man, P.I. He's a sensitive, compulsive about catching fruits. Rayman, what do you make of this? But Victor was found wearing only his underwear. Definitely get my boss into a team-art Cincinnati. He sees to it that every criminal gets his day in court. He was called, Tennessee Judge Wobbner. Judge Wobbner is not on the people's court anymore. Uh-oh. Wayne Man P.I. And for Saturday nights. But not a Monday. Definitely not a Monday. Yeah, whatever you say. On 10.44 or 16.24, 11.5.60. WQA and anyway, start to read the thing about the cable I got side tracked by some crap. Yep. Comcast and a half itself learned not work was operating. Go Comcast and Delphi largest cable company in Palm Beach service for most subscribers. Well, return when the electric comes back, damage to cable infrastructure. Sometimes make that impossible. Because internet access is almost always linked to a phone or cable service. Hundreds of thousands of South Floridaans are also webless. Like George and Josh is webless. Delphi South said it was delaying by two weeks. Local phone rating increases. Oh, thank you so much. I'm proved by the Florida Public Service Commission schedule to take effect on Saturday. But to give you a two week. And let me ask you this. You think on your cable bill, you're going to get like a rebate from the days that it was not operating. So you bet and on your phone bill. Absolutely. I'll call them up and I'll say I was without cable for this much. Please credit my account and they will as they have in the past with no less or fuss. Well, thank God for that. Meanwhile, the Alphi has said 42% of its 165,000 cable TV internet customers in me. Volkid Delrey or he had service yesterday. Of Adelfi is almost 200,000 customers in the West Palm area. Only 38% had service. And a Palm Beach Garden area, 70% of 120,000 subscribers were up and they had service too. Of Adelfi is 43,000 customers in Broward, 91% of its service in date numbers were 68 or more. 68% of more than 76,000 customers. Following all these numbers? No. Well, I don't know. They either make you feel a little more optimistic or make you feel depressed if you don't have your stuff. Which is your case. Advanced cable communications, which has fewer than 50,000 subscribers and cruel springs in Westinson, fewer than 10% of its customers were without service. For satellite TV operators, direct TV and dish network, the biggest problem is dishes that were blown away or shifted by their hurricanes wins are busted in half like mine. My direct TV of tourists. Direct TV said 25 to 30% of its customers lost service after this storm. Schoest and Robert Mercer. Remember Bobby Mercer? No. Said the company was working closely with FTNL, the Restore Service by Neighborhood and Neighborhood by Neighborhood as soon as electricity is restored. Direct TV rival dish network wouldn't say how many of its customers are without service. How many customers do they have in the entire software area dish show and network? Yeah. Oh. Well, that should be easy to figure out. Now here's the FTNL story and you believe it if you want, but I know. Don't believe it. Thousands of utility full snap and toppled during Wilma because of frequently strong gusts, not because of poor maintenance, Florida Plunder Reluital Facial City yesterday. FPL is examined 900 down polls since last week's storm and found no evidence that deterioration substandard materials are faded or anchored and deeply enough contributed to their demise. Company officials said. State regulators have criticized the company last summer for failing the document in specials of its polls in Broward and Dave. The issue had been on the back burner until last week. When Wilma scattered 7 to 10,000 polls across three counties, contributing to blackouts that affected more than 6 million FPL customers in the state. The second time I compare isn't about a thousand polls filled one Katrina hit the arena August, Katrina was a cat one preliminary data from the National Weather Service show top wins feeds that would make Wilma category one storm too. Each of William is their she's just everywhere, you know the geeshig girl, right? Vice President for distribution that failed since she thinks meteorologists have underestimated Wilma's force and eventually will conclude the wins must have been more powerful at least in some places. We just had Katrina the same area polls didn't rot overnight she said. That's interesting. Why the way to putting it? FPL and Zena John McAvoy said he's seen long strings of polls knocked down by Wilma. Some had been installed in the 70s and have been installed as reasonably as last year. Many of the downpoles were found next to an open field or pond where the one could have celebrated before hitting them. Of the 900 polls examined, the greatest majority. Work well above the ground level and broken away that suggests they were supposed to force far greater than design capabilities. Sounds to me like the Lord blew him down. Or maybe it was the three world the three bears. The wolf. You think? Mr. Huffington. The top three bears that were hopping in puffing. There was three pigs. That's where the little pigs in musk and bears. The indiscinders in the cinderfella. Most of the wooden poles used in south, I don't know any of those fairy tales. Most of the wooden poles used in south, I would assign to when Dura wins up the number of 18 miles in our concrete poles. They built significantly stronger. But many of those broke during well-matured, dang it. Cruise working in the field on Monday seemed to echo the conclusions reached by a field in the year. Well, there you go. I'll follow the following. But do we really believe a wrong? No, what are they going to say? You're going to say, boy, you guys really suck and don't bother paying us. I don't think so. I'll put her all whipped up about the avion flu now. I see how they changed the subject. Today he does that yesterday that it's been with the Supreme Court. The new Nazi they want to stick on there. And nobody's talking anymore about scooter, literally or about anything. That means anything. Or about all these people dying in Iraq and the February of the 2025 at least in American. Nobody's talking about any of these things. Because they're wagon the cats' ass is what they're doing, man. Couldn't they have wagged a dog a little bit, but these people are wagon the pigs are curly ass. The pig tail. I wonder if Johnny Depp is into it. What was that movie again? What was pigs? The pig tail movie with Johnny Depp. Oh, with a little spit curl? Yeah. Cry baby. Cry baby. I haven't seen that and I'm from what you tell me. I'm not a dog. Yankee clipper takes on a woman. But Yankee clipper. Why do I think a skipper chuck in Brazil and connection with that? Didn't he used to do a show there or something? It's not a skipper. I know who he was skis connected with or was with the Westett restaurant. We got the advertisement on our station by the way. The copper lake. Okay. Maybe it's because I think I once saw a Chuck's teeth sitting in a glass. I beg your pardon. Maybe it's because Clipper runs with skipper. Maybe that's it. But I don't think so. I think once it's back in the day. Back in the day. Skipper up to. I can't sit and do with that. But anyway, the Yankee clipper. I don't know. Joe Normazio. The Yankee clipper. He didn't have none to do with it either. The beach club building at the Sheraton Yankee clipper would remain close for a significant stretch of time in the wicket severe battery by Hurricane Wilma. But the 365 inland rooms will reopen once power returns to the four-log near the resort. And then the next day. That would make the clipper one of Wilma's biggest casualties among hotels. Broward tourism chief Nikki Grossman said a hundred of the eight hotels were open yesterday, but only 60 expected to be close for a week or ten days for the repairs. We're said they'd be ready to open as soon as they would gain electrical service. And I'm sure that I'm not the hotels are filling up with tourists, which I doubt very seriously. Or with local residents who have no power, one like a good or place where they can take it. Why don't I understand why you don't do that? You're making a big box. Huh? Yeah, take the family of one of those nice posh hotels on the beach over there. Everybody can take a nice hot shower. They have interest. They're so campy we're saying a cold shower. What's that all about? You can't wait to take a cold shower. Maybe he was doing this. He was a car. I mean, I didn't realize that. He's got to take a cold shower. Maybe that's a cow in front of the Dodgeplace. He's got him all whipped up. And did County, probably 99% of the county's hotels were open. He said, Ginny Guderias, spokeswoman for the Greater Miami Convention and visitors bureau. And she said, the hotels here. I expect a bit. That's what she said, just like having a rough. So why don't you get a cold but do you want me to be in the beach and Right here, in fact, that's what Greg ought to do for you. I just had a brainstorm. No, listen to me. This is the image. As a way of saying great job during the summer and because I really want to show you that I care, even though I hate you like poison George, I'm going to get you for the weekend. This coming weekend. A nice big, a couple of people are on my beach and one of our many trade outs. I know that's what I've treated. And those, on and long today, and do you take the whole family over there? And probably probably up on a high floor too. So if somebody in the family should fall off the balcony, it always went great. Miami's Conrad, a luxury hotel in that headwind. You don't think that's a nice idea? Yeah, it's nice. I'll keep trying it. And we're sure that he won't do it. Yeah. Miami's Conrad, a luxury hotel in that headwind was blown after England. We'll must say yesterday that we opened within 10 days far better than the end of November. We turned first printed by the hotel. In the keys about 90% of the resorts are up and running. Said tourism, spokesman Andy Newman. So what happened with fantasy-fifth? Yes, can they? On a wonderduff, no one does you hit a leave or go out of town because there were no fantasy-fifths. Who probably would like to go like to province town? A bigger section, little palm island, and resort, they posh get away on little torch key, which won't reopen till December the turn. Little palm island, a resort. Jesus. In news about the Yankee clip, or came amid confusion over the fatal landmark hotel, which helps to meant the city's fun and sung reputation in the 60s when it was sung and fun before they destroyed all those miserable old Graham. When it led, where the boys are from, on location there with Connie Francis and Frankie Avalon and all those other Graham. The hotels operator, Starwood hotels and resorts worldwide, it should news release saying the attack property would remain closed and definitely after the storm. There was just an error made, general manager, a mori piedra said. Starwood said, well, those damage prompted the trip to move up for the invasions plan for May. Summer, please go to hotels and fill construction and begin. Here's the, the hotel might do that with the 125. Room, uh, be, hey Connie. She's got a little problem, yeah. Connie Francis. She was okay, MGM records as I recall, y'all label. I might do that with the 125 room beach run building with that larger building crossade when it would stay open, even during renovations. He said the beach run building suffered broken windows and water damage, which could take an extra month to cover the surface. To the, I keep looking for parts to open parts are closed. Take the whole family over there and now y'all hotels are up. I think that's a decent idea. I mean, who the, what kind of tourists are going to come to a place that's hurricane battered and, uh, press the 80 into his bowling balls and lunch Canadians who are down here in forest. Oh, that's a big project there. No wonder the Lord smoke you again with Wilma. He's in the right place. It's good thing the, a panther's in Montreal tonight. By the way, the bell center is in the arena where they play the bell center. I just thought I mentioned it and passing just anybody here. Oh, yeah, I seen it from the outside. Do not go to Montreal. The food is great, but the people are French. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, the pound, 5, 6, the Verizon, and sing it a lot of a song. We're getting slowly but surely if you restaurants called in, maybe you'll even find a taco bell where some drive-through places that are open already. On the, huh? We got a, a messenger getting some taco bell as we speak. Really? Who went to get food? I sure hope not to mow. No, I find it like that's what he's in the ear. Although, you know, I'm going to have to have him, you know, it's muggle the food in under his shirt. I'll let him get it fat boy. No, one of my friends. Oh, one of your friends, but you don't want to say who? Oh, you know. Can be Tony, could it? No, nobody that works here. Oh, a personal friend, let's get you Taco Bell? No, an personal friend. I see, well, that's great. Thank God for that, man. And of course, if you do break your own food into the station, some hazard will come along and just grab it right off the table there. And, you know, run away with it. Absolutely. I don't want to mention no names or don't don't don't don't don't. That is shocking. I mean, there are some people who are true sociopaths. They cannot function in conjunction with any other human. They just, with any human. I shouldn't say other human because that makes the biggest assumption big leap. They just can't interact with other people. They need to be like, I don't know, maybe with animals or, I, I don't know where or what? You don't want to say? Not Magazin no name is, of course. Absolutely. Come over to QAand. Hello. I'm right open. Come later. Hello. Yes. Alice. Wait, now we'll come lift up. Oh, it's awesome. Andy, your house is cleaner than it is because different laws can't be confessed. I really don't think everyone knows what happened really just after to Huey switching things here.

You don't need to go all the way to Vancouver See yeah, oh yeah, they smoke openly here I mean go out and smell like guns in the air and like who gives a crap but in America all man And I still can't get over the fact that nobody's talking anymore about that kid that 20 year old guy Oh, you know, he was a dirty artist He was a deal. He was a dealer So they killed his ass and that jackass swatine got a call to that day on the show Shame on you you murderer and we got a scale here in the studio that you bought well guess what This is the Neil Roger show This is a blank Women in a bag Oh, there's the Royal Couple.

Laura, a fact says, and says, I have been able to send this previous days. I'm still without power, and didn't return to the orphan until the day. But, she says, let me purpose by saying, F.B. All sucks the big one. Man, in the beginning, after the hurricane, F.B. Allifies they need to handle hospitals and emergency places first. Okay, that's fine. That's fine. However, on Tuesday morning, I had to make it over to Kiva Skin. I saw 12 F.B. All trucks working on restoration on Kiva Skin. Why is that? There are no hospitals in Kiva Skin, could it be because money talks in Bush, mid-Walks, in this town money always comes first. And it's a looted and it's closing at P.L. sucks as well. You got your thumb out of honey, you're right. And this business of a, it seems like it's become like all the media wants to suck up to a voice. And now they all want to suck up there.

I got a story on that too coming up. Here's the story that I should have read a long time ago very important stuff I don't want to sit here and do a lot of reading especially with no calls coming in Well once that's this minute delay crisis up then you're gonna see any of season good stuff Laura Santina Who is that who's Laura Santina you might have? Laura Santina. Oh no, no, she had rights articles in this time it's a scroll chronicle piece and pre-demagazine and a whole bunch of other Women's studies counter punch or waking women et cetera and common dreams that are work Why aren't the Democrats screaming plenty murder and Laura you are absolutely got your finger right on it honey She says a recent possible article focused on the fact that Democrats are struggling to find one voice on Iraq We don't need one voice from the Democrats. We every Democrat who voted for this war to apologize for this illegal and a more war And it was this we leave Iraq immediately On October 11 2002 the Senate voted 77 to 23 in the house voted 296 to 130 three to authorize President Bush to attack Iraq if suddenly was saying refuse to give up weapons a mass destruction is required by U.N. Resolutions it didn't matter that who's saying had no weapons a mass destruction and hadn't had any since 1995 according to Edmuffins Inspector Scott Ritter a fact he says was well known by the US British Israeli and German intelligence It didn't matter that Iraq harboring a well-known counter terrorists It didn't matter that the weapons and inspections were moving along despite who's saying's moodyness on the subject It didn't matter that the whole world was watching who's saying there was no way he could possibly bring any more harm to his own or any other people To get the Congress and we the people on board in the words of general Anthony Zinney The administration cooked the books and the majority was not it approvingly a March 20, 2003 press in a Bush wall I'm with the unchecked power hand-to-doin by Congress declared preemptive war against Iraq Well over 2000 Americans recorded their rack body count project over 42,000 mackeys have died to date Thousands have been wounded many have been tortured in at Hamarkin and services grown long sharp teeth No one has been held accountable the truth was available to all members of Congress at the time of the vote and some chose to heat it Senator Mark Dayton said there was never any suggestion any briefings I attended that Iraq had or was about to acquire a nuclear weapons program Senator Kent Conrad took it upon himself before the event of the Iraq vote to read the book 1919 a history of Iraq's independence He learned about the longstanding conflicts between ethnic factions and knew that the Iraqi people wouldn't be waving you A strict reflex I knew know that was true. He said Senator Dick Durban didn't believe the hasty A hastily produced national intelligence document about Iraq's weapons standing on who that much of the document was conjecture Accord to Senator Dick and Lincoln, shapey the only Republican to oppose the war and never believed that the Iraq war was about weapons Amassage's corruption. It was this grand vision of changing the Middle East Grand vision of the Middle East how grand is a vision that requires bombing a country and he proud of its solar medical care for 10 years during sanctions How grand even effective can the vision be if the visionaries don't even know the history of the region? How grand is the vision that requires coming over 42,000 people over 26,000 horse civilians? How grand is the vision that destroys the infrastructure of another country and pays your own people big bucks to build it back up again? Even though many of the dead wounded are their own constituents and the children of their own constituents The high profile Democrats the ones who have announced your or her were to be preparing to announce a bid for the presidency are not Howling about having been lied to do not apologize him to families of the dead for their misguided votes did not insisting upon an immediate withdrawal from Iraq These Democrats who voted for the war include in Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton, Diane Feinstein and Julie Lieberman are Monitoring about political divisions stewing on mindless strategy about why the U.S. would stay in Iraq or mildly asking the administration for exit strategy plans The his credit John Kerry has proposed a tepid plan for withdrawing the troops but in doing so he referred to the war as a foreign policy misadventure It's not a misadventure. It's a bloody immoral foray backwards into cruel U.S. colonialism which was illegally manipulated by a bankrupt administration and approved by a large majority of our elected officials The only possible choice opened to us into the Nazi action and bringing to an end is quickly as possible The best way to support our troops is to bring them home before any more lives are lost Melvin Leard former Republican Secretary defense urges expedition withdrawal Contending our presence is what feeds the insurgency in Iraq Howard Zinn historian author argues that because the West Occupationalized it through to the civil war in Iraq The slower you phased it out to slower you in the insurgency Truthfully, the oblivious fascist ships and planes can bring them out It's time for the elected Democrats who support this tragic debacle to come clean and start running What a great article on well set up You spymeless jellyfish cowards, okay? We got a Nazi regime and the office is so called opposition is just rolled over and played dead Of course John Kerry he's busy doing the old deal He in fact he's even got a waffle iron Probably for his birthday. Don't be sent a mean nothing But he has electricity to use it to he probably's got the cable to his matter fact could old scary John Kerry In fact, I wouldn't be surprised to perform in mustard pages family a personal visit last night for Halloween You think he would probably dress up as her man monster and Halloween? He'll make up a sorry Or maybe Frank and Stein he could just put like them two bolts on his neck would be all he'd need Anyway, here's how the pull is coming up. He may confund John Kerry. Okay. He might just want again, but we sure pray not Even though he did win the last election. I think See this is another thing. How come the mainstream media that's swear I read the other aim? In the facts are right there. If anybody we'd be curious but they just don't two a stole them elections We've had a butt loveless cool in America. You've got an illegal regime taking the country down the toilet building up these multi trillion dollar deaths And it's like well, we got the other things to worry about Like his what's been him is the she meeting married their and taken to a rush And she really doing some of those oxies lost for a time when that be something huh? Actually, what was really what was poppin if you could see let's really he's hyperventilating these days He's got the inputs all the way up to his armpits Who are you most furious with George W.

A little more everything. Daddy, I'm pregnant. One pot, one. Feel the Parker. I don't know who the father is. I have to turn check our time. I drove the car into a tree. Can you just send me some cigarettes? What if my kisses are done? Hang out, but adults are the brightest room. I'm just going to get married again. I'm just going to get married again. Dad, that's my ass. I think I have a simple ass. I have to be one of the things. And I'm not sure if I've got a dad or girl. We're always. Hey, pop. We're moving in. And butterfly kiss. Dad, I have to move. I'm a lesbian. All right. 12.15. 16.25. Speaking of that, what a segue man. A lesbian minister was defrapped. Can I say that better college or I should see what we can pass it by the committee over there? Can we say the ****? To late now. Let's begin this. It was defrapped by the highest court within the United Methodist Church. Handing a win to traditionalist and one of several main line Protestant denominations. Split over the world. Homo Central is a matured. A win. The UNC's nine-member judicial council. Seven of them heard the case in Houston. Found that the Reverend Irene Beth Strowd violated the nominations van. Now it does a picture with her partner Chris Page. And I got news for Chris is as rich as it gets. So I held a lot of guys who only wished they were half as rich as Chris. Approved. And then says she is rich. And anyway, found that Reverend Irene Beth Strowd violated the nominations van on self about practicing homosexual clergy. The ruling was issued to its website yesterday. A church panel decided in December that Stroud 35, by being a lesbian partnership engaged in practices that are incompatible with Christian teachings. The panel's decision was a while. The second tons. The panel's decision was overturned by an appeals committee, but the judicial council now has back the original ruling. Stroud's representatives had argued that taking away her clergy credentials because he's a lesbian amongst discrimination. Well, what's a good religion if they can't discriminate, right? Well, as the queen, there is the queen. The queen is not just over the sillyest old queen I've ever seen. Well, not really. And Prince Philip, what are mum's are he's? You can just tell by looking at him. What are hard ass mum's are bastard he is. The judicial council says the church doesn't discriminate based on sexual orientation. Gaze and lesbians are allowed to become Methodist ministers, but they must remain celibate. Don't do it. Don't touch it. Don't look at it. Don't think about it. Stroud could be welcome back with both arms. You know, the Methodist church council Thomas Hall said, but she'd have to be celibate. Stroud had acknowledged that the relationship between herself and her female partner was sexual. They're doing things. They don't even joist them on a thing about. What may be joyous to do in the same things for all we know. Stroud became an associate pastor of Phil office. First, the Methodist Church of Germantown in 1999 has said she never revealed her sexual orientation and documents related to her ordination, but didn't keep it a secret, either. If you said she decided to come out in 2003 because she felt she was being held back and her faith by not cheering to complete truth about her life. It could play with style against her last year. I thought I was prepared for anything, but the news still came as a blow of Stroud said in the phone interview yesterday. It's a sad day for me and my family and for my congregation. I think I said day for the United Methodist Church. Eight council members owed to defraxed Stroud. One council member was absent. Two members left keeping an insuancey hand we grow. World of separate statements and they feel felt badly about to resolve. I like that. We don't disagree with the legal analysis of our colleagues, although we deeply regret the outcome. They wrote, while the judicial council must be faithful to its charge from the church. We're also assisted to be heard pain and brokenness of the family of God, she said. Damn God! I'm more to God squad, crazy people. We hate you because you're doing stuff and we only wish we were doing the same thing. And maybe we actually are. For all we know, right? Right. The ones that point to fingers, man, those are the ones. No exceptions. Trust me when I tell you. 1648 votes on the pool of the staff on more day and we got a new one tomorrow. Because we kind of like easing back in things. You can see on our website that we're like easing back into what? That's why Josh has taken this time putting those stories on everyone. Because what's the rush when there's only a few people reading them, right? Right. You are so uptight, man. So sensitive. You think that after all, you've got the life writing. Got the big raise coming. Right. Yeah. I don't know. George is going to buy it at the 46th and Samsung HD TV. Sure. Got it. It's in time for the last part of football season. What's not to like? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. You actually, we able to check that out a little bit and see that details. I don't want to find out. I read about it. That's all I can do. Fifty to ten. It was ugly. If you think it sounded ugly, it trust me it was. Of course, greasy and there he's injured. I hope, oh and who is the quarterback in that game? That would be your boys son. Chris Sims. All Phil Sims kid. That's right. I'm getting confused. Who does Jeff Garcia play for now? He's a brown. Oh, he was in the brown game. You know, they keep showing that thing on the NFL channel. I'm sure you've seen him many times where he's on the sideline. Anybody got any come? Nobody wants any friends. Nobody wants any friends. You see man. I have that. That is pretty embarrassing. That is just, and to think that he supposedly was dating that probably the best a beat of curtain chick we ever had on it. What's that with her name? Carmella this Caesar. Oh my God. She was hotter than the face of the sun. That's how hot she was. And he may have been like, I don't know. Hang in around with her. You know, who knows what to deal with? Nobody wants fresh bread. Well, I bet you he gets a listen. I like a room. Man, oh man. Hey, Jeff. You silly person. You're fair. Anyway, so like I said, we're getting all the stuff on his books. We're using back in which it's like the other people aren't there. He's back in their lives, right? Like our sales department's kind of like easy back into it. Real slow and easy. Slow as we go. Kind of like F.P. and L today. What an accomplishment in the four hours between six and ten o'clock. Well, maybe that's because it's raining. And think is it raining still? No. What was it? It probably will be in the four hours. So these next couple of days and my slow things are we. But always said 24 to 40 hours. They didn't say any rainouts, my slow things down. It's not like nothing about rainouts. But they probably don't want to be handling. Just like that minister, they've got the fried. When we do the back. Hold the microphone. We handed that show. We're funny and appropriate. Yeah. The Lord fried his dash. How do you like that? The Lord works in mysterious ways. Now what the, the nomination was he to remember. I forgot. I'll board again. Some Protestant. They got a little head to cost all. Yeah, one of those has to be. And the Lord looked down and he's smother right there in a spot man. He's going to raise your back. That ties this. And he had. And that's in him. Dead man. Kind of like Don I. I said man walking all this guy. He walking no more. Dead man sitting with a cowboy hat. 26 past noon. I'm just rambling. I just feel like being a rambling kind of guy. And it's obvious to me there's make no mistake about it. But the guys across the street. They're not on the ear and they're going to have an else to do. So it gives him more time to call us. You know, try to tune them in on this little radio. We have a hand. Can you hear anything? Well, no. Really? I think if you get right to seven. You hear. Oh, I heard a bunch of that.

Oh, come on. Okay. WQAM. Hello. Okay, I said I got better stuff here. Plyce President Dick Chany replaced I-Lewis School to LeBeeze's National Security Advisory yesterday with an A that identified by a former Iraqi exile group as the White House official to whom it fed information and erected turned out to be erroneous. I said the Bush administration relied on somebody information from the Iraqi National Congress to argue that Saddam Hussein had to be asked him before it could be a vane biological or chemical weapons throughout Kata first strikes on the US. But no such weapons were discovered after the invasion and US intelligence agencies and the independent commission of the United States. The United States was the first to be able to get the information from the American government. The United States was the first to be able to get the information from the American government. But no such weapons were discovered after the invasion and US intelligence agencies and the independent commission of the United States found no evidence of operational cooperation between Iraq and Al Qaeda. The White House announced the answer today the elevation of John Hanna to replace LeBeeze's national security adviser earlier in the day announced that LeBee would be arraigned Thursday in federal court on charges of perjury, making false statements that obstructed justice. He was expected to plead innocent. And the same things, just like Watergate, all you have to do is say I can't remember I can't remember I can't recall. That was Erlickman Holdman and Dean in that crowd, Mitchell and Dean. Just say I can't recall I can't remember. And that's what the right on the box. A lot of remember. The White House also announced that David has added to him has been Cheney's legal counsel where the sum-libis duties as chief of staff like Hanna adding to this play they quiet the influential role in the vice president's office. The Washington director of human rights watch accused adding to helping draft policies that led to the abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Vice President's office is previously denied that Hanna received INC information. Tennis office didn't respond immediately in questions yesterday about Hanna and Annington. All blackheads worse and speaking across the INC's leader Ahmed Chalabe, who was once wanted by this country by the way as a criminal and he is a criminal for Storeston Jordan and for like feeding information to Iran. Now I depended Prime Minister in Iraq. While listening if we got a bunch of course running the US watching, we saw a bunch of course there too right. We want to install our kind of government over there. Off my call with close to changing another senior administration architects of the invasion. The INC supplied Iraqi defectors to the information they are not to be false. The INC supplied Iraqi defectors was information they are not to be false. It is insisted that it tried its best to verify the detective's cleave factors claims before passing them to the USA. June 26, 2002 the INC wrote literally sent an appropriations committee staff identifying Hanna as the White House recipient of information gathered by the group through a US fund and effort called the Information Collection program. Nighter of Tainted Copyed letter and previously reported on it. The letter written by N. T. Tha Khanbar, then the director of INC's Washington Office identified 108 articles in leading Western News meeting which instead of the INC and formalist information that it fed the Hanna as well as the senior Pentagon official. The information included a claim by an INC supplied defector that he visited 20 secret nuclear biological and chemical warfare facilities in Iraq. His claim first appeared in December 20, 2000, what article in New York Times, then in a White House background paper a decade of deception defines, released in conjunction with a September 12, 2002 speech of the UN General Assembly by Bush. The individual Howard showed deception, the CIA had been a administrative, light detective test, three days before the New York Times article appeared, was unable to identify a single illicit arms facility when the company US weapons inspection through Iraq and January of 2004. Lair, liar, pants on fire. After the war US officials determined that the facility in Salman Park was used to train Iraqi anti-terrorist commandos. Adding to this been a key play behind widely criticized US policies that led the torture and other B.C. attendees held in Afghanistan, Iraq, according to Tom Al-Al-Anski, Washington director of Human Rights Watch. He will be reportedly helped draft an opinion by then White House Cousel, Al-Bertov and Zollis thing that the Geneva Convention didn't apply to some of the attendees in the war on terrorism. This was somebody who worked very hard to make sure the Vice-Nesan Senior Military Officials and National Security Professionals on the Quest of Interrogation policies was ignored Madame Louskey said that the result was an unmedicated disaster for the USA. Not even like that. So we replaced one couple of trucks with two more trucks. And then it was a much more choppy. Did you ever look at him? Did you ever look at him? He has crook written all over his face. Did you just look at him? I mean, I mean, I hate to say he can tell a court by looking at him. But look at him. There you look at him. No thanks. 21-01-567056, the Vice-Queen of Colin or two. Although I have a humongous pile. I must like Howard Beal. I must make my, what was the line he said when he came in and the raincoat was pouring. I don't think my, huh? I pointed around. It's something like that when he went in the elevator. And Josh didn't like that movie. And the more I think about that, the more it just crossed my old crackly ass. I just, I can't put it over there. Yeah, I think it means up some evening. You could have it invite Georgia because he doesn't have any power. And he can watch the movie with him like explain it to you. This, this, he's opening my closet. This, he's five 16, 18, 18. And I just think it's anyone. Who's the good to go? Can't believe the language I hear all you read. And we all the word is of the sanity. And it used to be that cable was a whole lot worse. But now the networks left there and just curves. There's a wind and sights of physics and a treaty. All the dire lock and tanks for vanity. It's where it's like a sailor on a free day's pack. Words are whole lot worse than ours. That's them. I can't wait for that. 1243 and 56, you WDQA. I'm an insurance one by like reslightening you know. It's not. Yeah, it is a little bit. Or Georgia's not doing it. Yeah, he's taking a suit. I guess, you know. Oh, my god, he's taking a docent iteration of quadro. That is really scary. Hey, that taco belly, you know. Oh, that's right. I forgot about the taco bell. It goes right through like an ace bomb. And I wanted you to get the awesome taco bell. Oh, yeah. But we do supreme with no beans. That's my favorite of taco bell. In fact, you might inspire me for once. I might have to go, oh, no, we got plenty of taco bells here. I got me a burrito supreme. Did you read me? I don't think he's a taco and a nacho supreme. Please say you win no beans. I got a with beans, but no. I don't prefer it that way. I just forgot to, you know, or musndu. Those beans are mushy. Did you ever look, I mean, when you go to taco bell, you've been inside, right? Of course. And you see the big fat of that mushtet that got, you know, that mushy beans. Yeah. I don't think so. You know, the colony knows what's swimming around in there. I don't hear you. I don't like that. I don't like the, I just don't like beans period. And of course, you're not the right thing group anyway. Now that Georgia's taking a doos. Oh, and I'm going to save this year for when it comes back because he'll be interested in. I hate to do that, but it's just the way it goes. Well, so well, instead, maybe I'll take a call or two while we're with your, to return from his mission. Why not from doing his duty for his country? WDQA, and hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, this week is worth the last week down here, man. I had everything all set last week and I was good to go, but now it's things back to normal. Man, it's brutal out there. Yeah. Yeah. I got power back on Thursday and Hollywood. There's a big trick to it, but I can't tell you what it is. And George still has that power, so. Ha ha ha. There you go. That's the soft floor audience for it. I got mine. I like that. Good thing he and the fact he probably might have to go back for seconds real quick. How many QAM? Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I had a revelation about the Republican Party. Yes. I figured out why they may never lose another election. Well, it's pretty easy to win when you're fixing. Well, that's true, but here's what I think my theory is, is there's enough rich, greedy people that they're going to vote for the party that's got the lowest taxes? No matter what, no matter what any other issue they don't care about. But if you're talking about that, the rich, greedy people are very small percentage, and they're like less than 2% of the whole country. Well, that's one thing, the greedy rich, and then they're like the people. So that's why, for instance, you'll never hear them apologize. You're on a scooter living because that's not a sin. They just are on the forefront of sin. You know, gay marriage, you know, you know, you know, all mad as it's got to be a sin. And then they deal with a big relationship. So I can't get a sin, right? And now that's just political hardball. If you hear him on the talk show, that's good old fashioned hardball. But if you have something, if the American public is that stupid, then they're going to get exactly what they deserve. Well, that's exactly right, but since they are that stupid. And I'm all right. Good luck to you, Pally. It's easy for me to say, sitting up here, looking down. Oh, you're looking down on America. That's right, sir. I know you mentioned it. The prospect of a birth to life, break maybe panicking people around the globe, but it's proving to be very good news for defense secretary, don't call me here on Gering Me in, Donald Rumsfeld. And other politically connected investors in Dilly add sciences, the California biotech company that owns the rights to tantal flu, the influenza remedy that's on the most sought after drug in the world. Remember the, uh, what was the one, uh, what we had the answer acts it was, uh, the pro, the pro. That's right. In fact, I got some old steel, simple with the house. I'll be glad to say that we'll keep hold of it. Uh, no, I actually figured what I was given the cipro for in the first place that I don't do with the anthrax. And speaking of anthrax, how's that investigation come, Dally Rumsfeld? Speaking of him? And trash. Yeah. Ever get those people? How about the person of interest whose life they destroy? How about Jose Padilla and his suit case that doesn't exist? Rumsfeld served as Gilly add researchers chairman from 97 until he joined the Bush administration in 2001, and still holds a Gilly and stake value that between five and 25 million dollars, according to federal financial, the sloshes filed by Hermann Gering Rumsfeld. The forms don't reveal the exact number of shares that he owns, but in the past six months, the figures of a pandemic in the ensuing scramble for Tamiflu and San Pileas start from 35 up to 47 bucks. That's made the Pentagon chief already one of the wealthiest members of the Bush cabinet, at least a million dollars richer. Rumsfeld is in the only political heavyweight benefiting from demand for Tamiflu, which is manufactured marketed by Swiss farmer giant Roche. Gilly ad receives a royalty from Roche equally about 10% of sales. Former secretary of state George Schultz, who's on Gilly ads board a sold more than seven million dollars worth of Gilly ads since the beginning of this year. Oh, brother. Another board member is the wife of former California Governor Pete Wilson. I don't know if anybody would take company that's so politically well connected to this endless andr Mcdonald of think equity partners in Tamifran'sisco. What's more, the federal government is emerging as one of the world's biggest customers for Tamiflu and July, the Pentagon ordered 58 men. This is like the answer, actually, all over again, it sounds like to me. Would Cipro, remember that? Yep. They were hopping that up like it was like it was rushed trying to find his oxies man, unbelievable. In July, the Pentagon ordered 58 million dollars worth of the treatment for US troops around the world of Congress's considering a multi-billion dollar purchase. Roche expects 2005 sales for Tamiflu to be about a billion dollars compared with 250 million last year. About four times as much. Rumsfeld recuse himself from any decisions involving Gilly ad, when he left the company, became Secretary of Defense, and late last month, notice they seen your Pentagon official. So when even further, when had the Pentagon general counsel issued additional instructions, outlining what he couldn't could have been involved in if there were an avion plupid pandemic and a Pentagon had a respond. Other than, of course, making the profits. As the flu issue he did not for earlier this year, according to the Pentagon official, Rumsfeld considered unrolling hit and loading his entire gale at stake in Southeast Advice of the Department of Justice, the SEC, and the Federal Office of Government Ethics. What that would mean about government ethics, as he sure doesn't have any. Those agencies did not for an opinion, so Rumsfeld consulted the private securities lawyer, who advised him that it was safe at a holdout of the stock and be quite public about his recuse rather than sell and run the risk of being accused of trading on inside of information. Alam, Alam, Alam, Alam, Martha Stewart, something Rumsfeld doesn't believe he possesses. So he's keeping your shares for the time being. Thanks to not just condescending arrogant. And of course, every time he gets together with the media, yep, yep, yep, so you're fking it up. Just like when Bush did that thing with the National Press Club and he was doing that, you know, see, right there, right that moment, that was a defining moment in history of this country. When he was yuckin' enough about and he was going from one end to the stage to, oh, no weapons over here, no weapons. No weapons. No weapons. Now, if you're the parative or soldier, forget about the dead ones, even with a ones that are alive, over there in Iraq, and he's making a joke on, oh, no weapons over here is still looking. That's so funny. Really funny. Okay, that's to be making jokes about caskets. Bastard. Great, Robert. Just blood gushing in his hands. And a public sitting in these right where as long as he doesn't care what he does, these religious nuss because he's their spokesman, man, he's the one that's carrying the torch for them. And they don't confuse them with anything else. Just like your friend, they're Robert Greeper, self-hating whatever he is. He said that you bastard part. Man, oh, man, well, what is that all about? It's his family loaded. They got a lot of cash or something. Maybe, are all the Jews here loaded? No. Who will explain? I mean, what can that possibly be? What is that all about? And they had a damn David from speaking to self-hating Jews out over the weekend. Every time I see him, I want to vomit. I just want to puked. He ever did. He never seen him out of the talk and he chose David from the former speech writer. No. Oh, my god. Talk about a cell out. Talk about a self-hating piece of turd. And then of course, your close personal friend with the bad haircut. You're fair, Mr. Fudge. Although, well, in my some a lot. Anyway, here's the story I wanted you to hear. I saved this until you came back from your evolution. Thank you. New Pubcast and Steve completes right wing coup. Oh, yeah. You said you're fan of NPR and public board. Yeah, I heard that we posted that story a while back, but. How about your program update? Yes. Timothy Carr campaign director of free press. He was the executive director of media channel, I media for democracy. He says the new president of the corporation of public broadcasting, CPP, has set the agency's offices with Lighthouse Propagandist and GOP lawyer list in a bold-faced effort to carry forward ten of Tom Linson's right wing crusade against public broadcasting. CPP president Patricia D. Stacey Harrison, the former chairman of the Republican National Committee, was set by the CPP board in June, has hired senior officers from the State Department's public affairs and public diplomacy division. Which oversees government's efforts to advance U.S. interest in security and to provide the moral basis for U.S. leadership in the world. Public diplomacy is govously for propaganda. The CPP was created to shield public broadcasting from political interference not to be a mega-foned for the White House. Harrison's latest highest proved that the Republican lawyer list of the CPP have been deterred from their quest to turn America's treasured public broadcasting system into partisan echo chamber. Three new CPP has all previously served with Harrison at the State Department where she served as assistant secretary for educational and cultural affairs and acting undersecretary for public diplomacy and public affairs. They follow close behind or once you join the CPP and it's got the names and backgrounds of these three Tom, Exit, Michael Levy and Helen Mowley. It says here the offices at the Poverty Stensive Profiles of the CPP has had free press, the packing of CPP within individuals more comfortable with selling U.S. propaganda than what on his journalism sends a NOSO and not so subtle signal to those working in public broadcasting that truth is out and spin is in. Harrison got a run position at CPP through political connections to the U.S. Chairman and Chairman, Kenneth Tomlinson also heads the broadcasting board of governors, which oversees the voice of America radio for Europe, radio and TV Marti, and other government run international broadcasting. Tomlinson's successor, current CPP chairman, Cheryl Halpern's another big GOP fundraiser, who spent seven years as member of the broadcasting board of governors. Tomlinson is currently being investigated for efforts to impose his political agenda at CPP by funding programming with a programman's slant, secretly monitoring PBS and NPR for signs of liberal advocacy journalism, as well as having unqualified political cronies like Harrison. Inspector General Kenneth Collins is affected to present his findings, which reportedly include ethical and procedural violations as well as misuse of funds today to a closed or medium of the CPP boarded directors of which Tomlinson reigns a member. The CPP is being governed more like a private secret society than the agency supported by testers at Jeff Tester, a second director for the Center for Digital Democracy. As the hiring of former State Department propaganda colleagues by Patricia Harrison illustrates, the CPP has been imilogically hijacked. Free press, the Center for Digital Democracy and Common Cause have repeatedly called for greater openness and accountability to CPP. Earlier this year we'd live in more than 150,000 petitions to the CPP, demanding talents and step down and board members and their partisan interference with public broadcasting. And then it says at the end, and you can hear this will be on the website, Tomlinson, or is this today? That's Tomlinson. Tomlinson, it's an ad you're named the petition vis-a-vis of the Creepers action page and it's got a link you can put on a story. So there you go. See this is the way it works, and it's in a domain stream media and then of course the public area where in the public broadcasting people just take off the old garden put in the new right wing. Sounds like the Nazis to me all over again, who cannot see that. Joseph Gervils have been proud of this even George Gouble would like it a little bit. Hi, sir, George. Go over George Gouble. How are you? Yeah, Bruce Cut. You've never George Gouble, that's very good. I bet you I bet you Josh Gordon's never even heard a George Gouble. Who? Or art link letter. I have not now. You ever heard art link letter? He's very lucky that way. Oh my god, he's about 110 years old and keeps showing up on Larry King all the time and they keep trying to figure out which one is the oldest and the father and who's got the best of spinners. He's also going to visit bag. Oh, there's the royal couple visiting the US. There's Charles and Camilla. Although I will say this for an old goofy idiot with his Kilsson crap. His appearance, he did say something fairly profound for him on 60 minutes. So I didn't see it, but I had the article which I bypassed yesterday because when he was on there. He actually has a longest year. Good sense of you. They say the British share of taxpayers' lot of money because when they fly over here they don't take a plane. Prince Charles says he believes the pace of climate change is terrifying and people are becoming too dependent on technology. In a rare interview ahead of his official tour in the US this week, Charles expressed concern that economic progress is upsetting the whole balance of nature. Oh, there he goes again with that pristine scissor talk. You see, next thing he'll be talking about global warming and making stuff up like that. You know, if he looked at the latest figures on climate change and global warming, they're terrifying. He told 60 minutes in the interviewer in Sunday. The Prince is a keen environmentalist but his office is trying to say whether Charles will raise the issue of climate change. But he dies with El Presidency at the White House this week. Clara's house, the Prince's office, said it would be not be appropriate to come in on a private dinner. Like did they have kishki and did they have like, you know, the photo fish with the horse radish stuff like that. In the past book has questioned the existence of global warming. In fact, I think the person probably would more likely to believe in the tooth fairy than global warming just like the British believe in ghost and not in God. I believe in the theories. Right. Yeah, I'd say this is refused to sign a few of the protocol to sign a greenhouse gas emissions saying it would harm the economy. And George said if they would have eliminated if they would have outlawed gas emissions, he probably would have had a very delicate procedure in the last couple minutes. I was really thankful for the gas. Good. Excipited everything. Okay, we got an hour to go. We're not going to be any gas station listings because they're all just about open according to these guys and the atoms say that everybody's open and they're given it away or something like that. What is this? Is it me or something? This is 5.62. Okay. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. Okay. Let's go. I'm up in Boca, taking a slap in all women with paint and lips around the floor. I listen to the new Rogers one, the two of us. I mean, I listen to the new Rogers here and balance one to two hours. What the fuck? It's a rope. By the way, so I've been given it some thoughts. So what do you think it is? I know that me and you get the doom. Much better go with 6 to 10 and not in 5. A 10 gallon of cranky do. I think we might be happy to get there. I think you really don't know that you're mine. You know to have your weary bed. That's not too tight. No chance I'm always so with you. And I'd rather die with the graphics and just... I'll have you know that I'm a big buggy Jew. For Brooklyn I... I've been with you. I have worried about you. You're not fine, I'm fine. Me and all, this crap would blow. No way that if we had a fight that you'd survive. Hold on a here at Chenetile. And push it like that's what we can do now. And... So what do I do, it's always so with you. So what do I do? For me is much better 6 to 10 and not in. It's only right that's what I do. So what do I do with me? For me is much better 6 to 10 and not in. It's only right that I should get more sleep at night. I think we might. Be happy, take care. Day for Christmas. Happy to get day for Christmas. I can't be mad. For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For what? Of what? For what? For what? For what? For what? For? For what? What? Okay, here's some information.

He also said he's never seen anyone like you on the year, and that you were the dirtiest and most talented, Everton counted. Pretty good stuff. Thanks a lot Scott. He's doing a problem with Ferrell as you can't talk to him. I was funny we get this fact so I was thinking about him this morning, and he would come in a studio before We're like during a break in his show, and I tried to tell him things, we're giving Like a little comment and he just, he would just ramble on. You know, like you can't talk to the guy. No. Now there might be some reason for that but nevertheless moving right along. President Bush's nomination is same Ali Alito Jr. for the Supreme Court sets up a direct class with seven Democrats. Finally igniting the momentous judicial battle at both parties of an anticipating for years. Republicans see an opportunity to install a lasting conservative majority on the high court as they characterize Democrats' obstructionists who try to accomplish in court what they can't accomplish to legislation. Democrats since the chance to portray their opponents' reactionaries would set back the causes of civil rights, workers and social justice, and the president is a leader to be holding the demands of his parties far right wing. As if there's any doubt. After a surprising respite from the judicial ward, the dominated Washington last spring, Bush had disign yesterday mornings seemed likely to resurrect the fight over filibusters, activists, judges, and the political rights cloud at the White House. Senator Barberd Boxer of California said a filibuster was on the table and has to be on the table after describing the elite of choice as a capitulation of the far right. Most senators chose their words carefully, so it's not to be prepared biased before the confirmation process even gets underway. If there was an unmistakable sense from both sides that were ready to rumble as family research council president Tony Perkins told ABC News, there's going to be a fight there needs to be a fight and we're ready Perkins said. We don't like him, but we like his pancake house a lot. Bush's past two nominees have defied simple in theological labels differing the battle that's been simmering with greater and greater heat as the court went at record 11 years without a vacancy. The court said it goes on about John Roberts and White House council carried admirers complete lack of any judicial record puzzles and it is from both parties as if what's that all about? Who the hell is she? But the nomination of a leader on unabashed conservative jurist who Bush voted as more judicial experience than a Supreme Court nominee for the past 70 years creates a straightforward fight over legal philosophy. The nomination takes on added significance because leader would replace justice San Bernardio counter, which regarded as the court's pivotal swing vote often providing the signing balance to the conservative or liberal side. While we're placing the late chief justice, what you're mernquist with the conservative such as Roberts was not expected to shift the court's ideological balance. Replacing counter with a leader would likely fulfill Bush's campaign promise to move the court decidedly to the right. We're going to make sure the Americans understand what the stakes had. Ralph needs president of people for the American way. A liberal group of taken legal and opposing Bush's judicial nominees. These set a organization will mobilize at 750,000 members to wage a massive national effort to defeat a leader's nomination, a certain that replacing a mainstream conservative like Justice O'Connor with a far-right activist life-saving will alito with threat Americans rights and legal protections for a decade. On the other side of the political spectrum, Conservatives said the nomination finally will allow them to make the case that they support judges of interpret the constitution while Democrats support judicial activists who led the slate from the bench. This is a very healthy public debate said when the long-consulted judicial confirmation network, which claims 60,000 members in a $3 million advertising budget dedicated to confirming conservative picks to the court. It's long overdue, she said. Fitch. Senators of the return of Washington today for the start of the legislative week in both sides of the Scottish strategy for an nomination process that Bush wants completed by years in, but could well take longer. If Democrats decide to fill a bus, they'll need to hold together at least 41-44 members, which would be a tough task in the case of an nominee who's legal credentials, regardless of its ideology or so strong. Democrats also made face the threat that Republicans would use their majority forward to ignore the filibuster, prompting a battle over a set of procedures that strongly favors the majority party. But even short of a filibuster debates on says matters as abortion, game marriage, workers protections, environmental regulations which are elected with some Mahaprofiber in the confirmation process, could all consequences for the 2006 congressional elections and the 2008 presidential race. Are we actually going to have more elections or not? No. I think we're going to cancel. By focusing on selected rulings filed, it all such as his loan dissension landmark rulings that struck down a Pennsylvania law, requiring a woman to inform her husband before receiving an abortion that outlawed a position of machine guns, Democrats believe they can make a vote to confirm, well, he'd a political handicraft in the 2006 elections. As we approach the election, people are going to be hit with a reality that they're stuck with a present until January 20, 2009, and the only way to check him is with an democratic congress box who said. This take only answered a lot of issues where Bush had been so far out of the mainstream, he's choosing to write it up with a mass majority of Russians, obviously said, of course he happens to be a social victim. Man. Assert. Five six seven, five six, six, and one other thing about Sam Alito. Yeah. More than two centuries of Protestant denomination on the Supreme Coral End of he's confirmed as its next justice for the first time in the country's history, five Roman Catholics, the majority would be on the high court. Man. Man. The Tory Confessions. There you go. And then of course, is it the Rose Rebeads or the BDIs that have a son nervous about the new Anasi Pope? It all kind of fits in the evidence. You see that always code it. Life is like a jigsaw puzzle. Also that man, the Tory, you have to let the priest have sex with your son. You know. Until it gets past the age of twelve. Right. Yet news that the son of a man has had an immigrant father, someone who grew up in a suburban New Jersey, personally served as a elector, I wonder if he knows Hannibal. And later, Mary, doesn't quite show you the power it might have in the days when Kennedy ran for the White House. Catholics have become part of the nation's political mainstream far removed from the blatant Andy Catholic prejudice that once permeated American culture, there is a divided as other Americans on abortion of the social issues that will be a focus of his confirmation hearing, making an outforgive religious pride that they can serve at a jurist less likely. A Catholic community is not going out dancing in the streets of Boston, not because of this The nominations had James Davidson. If we're new university sociologists who research his religion in Supreme Court justices, but it still represents the significant development of American religious history. Oh, that looked at that rummese. What I say, you can't because you don't have to kill him. Come back on. No. It did not. What are you talking about? Your table didn't come back on. Well, I'll be a horse whip. It would benefit me somehow. Orce whip. Yeah. I'll be thanked. Well, you want your own soul anyway. You're not really a horse. No. No. Well, that's Barbara Sarge. She is a guy. I found out she's got a well. Who are you most furious with? That's our full question today. And pretty big two, 1722 votes. George W. Bush, 715, man. They hate them. They're furious. They're pissed off and fired up. If only the Democrats in Congress could be as pissed off and fired up as most of the public then we might get somewhere. Nobody. I'm doing great. 2020. 12.7% of the audience are doing great. They're fine. That's what they're saying. Oh, we're fine. Gas companies, 181, FDNL179. And like I said, the people are most pissed off. And then don't have the internet stay out in no power. So they can't vote. Jeff Bush 93, the Democrats 83, the media 63. What I'm saying is, a late neighbor is 51. Insurance companies 43, FDNL41. Local politicians is God. But third man. Bell South 13 and the banks still have only 10. So I'm assuming that pretty much banks are open. Is that correct? Pretty much. Pretty much. Pretty much. Okay. And if your bank isn't open, let go there and just go to the drive-through and start screaming. What's wrong with you, people? What are you? You got all my money in there? Open up. You idiots? All the money that we've all gotten those banks. They can afford a generator. Okay. Trust me when I say it. In fact, I really wonder why something in doddles so long before they find the, uh, got, we got to it. There's some real dodlers in the slaggers in the crowd. Speaking of slaggers, we got Mohower David who likes to piece a lot, especially if somebody else bought it. Mohower David came out from New York 2 to 4. That's the way. It's just a tickles my fancy man. They say on passions. It tickles fancy. A man called 4 to 7, the Panther Preview was 7, Panthers at the Colombeans at 739. Panthers at Montreal followed by 80K in Las Wages. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.162A. Good work with men. What's your hired for? Just for help us. Does that seem clear to you to help us? To help men who are going out there, to try to earn a living. You company man, you're fairies. Absolutely. Back in the day when someone done a strong, we didn't say very grand. In Pearl Harbor, it was a chance to drop their box. We've followed them back, and now the Saudis is in the it has died. And on our cars are little flags waiting. As that's all the love and retired points of bombers the wrong way. And other barriers to be in America, where they follow those like cheese. Do 90 stays in some arrogance. And by woodshed and 70, we think that this country... ...has a great joy to us in our days and our days to reach. I don't want to be a packs of Americans in the USA. What's a few thousand innocent lives stop living in the past? If you want that SUV to drive, you're going to need more gas. It's a great history in the world. They train us to the least, and anyone who says that obviously. And afford to be. And thousand barriers to be in America. Where we pay three of them, please. We have flagged one has with our hand in the sand. And lightly follow the powers that we have a sentin. And I don't have to do that. Watching states from you on a 65th street. Scratcher, five, everything's okay. You will say... You understand to just stop all things to act on everyone. And if you do, far, don't like to us here at Ticketsbury, freaked out. 132.5.60.WD.Couway in ever since the Church of Scientology's sprawling UK headquarters. We're located, I'm glad you remembered, Kirstie Allen. And that's perfect. Okay, go. Ever since their sprawling UK headquarters, we're located just three miles up the road. The State town of East Winston, Sussex, who's grown accustomed to life on the edge of a parallel universe. But nothing could have been quite prepared for the events of the past three days. First game reported sightings of Tom Cruisan's pregnant fiancé, Kivi Holmes, being chauffeur to St. Hill, a man or a, a remote church in house, which the Scientology file file, they shouldn't wait to take too much time getting her not to bid a. No, I wonder who did it. Being chauffeur to the last time I said day, not him. Being chauffeur to St. Hill, a man or the remote church in house, with the Scientology file, founder, El-Ran Hubbub, brought, bought as his world base, 45 years ago. Then John Revolten is wife-cully pressed and arrived at the same location they're private yet. Volkysicurity staff prevented ordinary moral seeking to the three-day annual gale off from by the sign-overs as the Church's members are all being known locally. But those inside the court non-Sherty net watch crews, when a standing ovation, by donating 2 million pounds to the Internet's so much about three and a half million dollars. To the International Association of Scientologists in St. Hill, just in 15 years ago. Local people who started field economic effects of Scientology's big year will long be for the celebrity's fish-top. A crowd of $6,900 from afar as field as Ukraine and India had paid to be a free net's event at the Hall, I wonder if they were serving curry, I wonder if it smelled like it, with a further 3000 of both Saturday and Sunday. That constitute a tourism boom for a hotel, yours, and coach firms, nicely, two since rear-way engineering meant the delgots had to be busted of venue, coach firms. Needless to say, this is in the Brit independent, that's why it sounds a little on the stuffy side. Of course, Scientologists are used to selling out since head over cash as a key part of the Hub of Dr. Oncenturator, and crews the Diamond Maritorious Award, which followed the Platinum Equivalent Award last year when his contribution top two and a half million dollars. It remains the biggest donor to Scientology. Other members of the cult have been less content about paying up, complaining they've been milked to thousands of pounds. Members of the cult, don't you love that? Oh yeah. What are you eating now? That taco, remember you were a breeder? Well, wait a minute, I thought you ate a whole bunch of that before, and that's why you had to make a desperate run. No, they were unconnected events. I see. Scientology said it was he blamed it on the burrito. I'd say it was. He said it looked like a burrito. The Church of Scientologists laid a celebration of its most famous devotee, Demonstrations, value and building awareness crews recently raised a few eyebrows in Hollywood by insisting on a Scientology tent on the set of Steven Silver's War of the Worlds, but he's largely responsible for a boasting traffic in the cult's website to 375,000 hits a day. Man, even George doesn't do that, many. That's the guy. It's unclear if the world is wife and crews' fiancee had the chance to talk. If so, it's reasonable to assume that Miss Preston would have pressed home the cult center of Dr. Dr. Dr. about childbirth that mothers should not express pain while in labor for sure of traumatizing the babies. Right. Let me tell you. If get off the weeds, they're having your head squeezed through that tube isn't traumatic, then I don't know what is. Cube! Now, now, your buddies at Walmart, their Walmart strikes back, Bentonville, inside a scuffy windowless roof, this is a very long story. I'll be in our website tomorrow for the New York Times. I'll be in our website, read this a lot, but enough. Just enough to write your appetite. To show how desperate they'll be coming. Inside a stuffy windowless room here, veterans of the 2004 Bush and Kerry presidential campaign sit, stand and pace around six plastic folding tables. Open containers of Preston nuts, I need a drink. Open containers and Preston nuts in top or old tremors, and a drinker space for laptops and blackberries. See it and flickers on the TV in the corner. The phone rings in a 20-something woman answers. Turn on Fox Shields, running up to the TV with an old pet. This could be important. A scene from a campaign war room well short of it's a war room inside the headquarters of Walmart. The giant discount retailer hopes to sell a new improved image to reluctant consumers. Walmart is taking a page from the modern political playbook, under fire from well organized opponents who have hammered the retailer with criticism of the latest, wages, health insurance and treatment workers. Walmart is recently quietly recruited former presidential advisors, including Michael Deber, who was Ronald Reagan's image master, and Leslie Dash, one of Bill Clinton's media consultants, to set up a rapid response public relations team at Arkansas. When small business owners are union officials, also in front political operative some past campaigns, criticised the company the war room swings in a fashion with press releases, phone calls to reporters instead web postings. One target of the ever are swing voters or consumers who haven't soured on Walmart, the new approach appears to reflect the fear that Walmart's critics are alienating the very consumers it needs to keep growing, and especially middle of an income Americans motivated not just by price but by image. The first big challenge of the strategy will come November 1 with a premiere of an unsighted week documentary, Walmart, the high cost of low price that today is a matter of fact, was made on a shoe stream budget of $1.8 million and is being released in about 2,000 theaters. It's director Robert Greenwald hopes to show the movie in thousands of homes and churches in the next month. The possibility that it might become a cut-hit like Michael Moore's on some of that at Portrait of General Motors, Roger and me has Walmart worried big time. So Walmart is embarked on a counter-offensive that would have been on tickable just a year ago, relying on a preview posted online Walmart investigated the events described in the film and produced a short video containing the film as factual errors. Mr. Greenwald denies their errors and says that Walmart hasn't even seen the final cut. Walmart is also beginning to promote a second film, why Walmart works and why that may some people crazy was cast the company in a rosy or light. Walmart declined to make its executive available for the Greenwald film, but it participated with a second film director Ron Galaway. No kidding. The World Room team helped us to read letter written by Mr. Galaway that challenges Greenwald to show the two movies side by each. To keep up with its critics, Walmart has to run a campaign to rob her mechanic, former political strategist at the Tobacco Institute who now oversees Walmart's corporate communications, it's simply nonsense for us to let somebody's attack school out of response he says, and it goes on and I'm like I said it'll be on the website tomorrow. All right. How many people have you think we're reading? I'm doing the best I can against a formidable odds, whatever that means. Because people here, they've got to get their lives back together again, and they sure as hell don't have time to be sitting around most of them reading a lot of even very thrilling and important stories on our website, which is unfortunate, but you know we go back in the archives later on, right? That's right. The law we're doing. Okay. Considering all things you go, and I will say this, unlike some stations I know at least we're still on the air. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62. Hello. This is Albert Kider from Tony Van Records, providing you American Infidel to buy latest cast-evens collection. You know my mom it is right. The safety head of your body got a misunderstanding with the real start plane. I wish I had an American hostage from those in better days. Oh, it's only shooting this classic. I was on the air, right? It suddenly was de-taste. Their matches I can burn. And where it's out on my head. I'm in front of an X-16. But they won with... Come on, even your purchase does not go to fund terrorism. Really? It's not time to get off the plane. Just relax and take it easy. You're just dumb. That's your fault. It wouldn't happen if I were to find X-in and a rag. If you want a decent... I got the variation on the classic. I asked myself every day, Which Americans should take? Tell me, who would you promise? Lain, don't you see it? I'm trying to deny a government. She let her be on an explosive set. So, by no chance, even skeletons would take from 1995. Or you can pay with me some nice work on or weapon of mass destruction. Oh man, that's the only reason I've played that. Just to hear that. It does it for me. They got their... Materials confused with the engines a little bit there. And the packies are all rolled in again. They're all brown. Sevent... Teen-tilled-two. I saw the Mexicans for that matter. Yeah. I saw the Peruvians and the Venezuelans. And the Bravilians. Oh, and that movie. What was the movie city of God? I don't want to disappoint that guy who was urging and pleading. I will not watch that. You said it to me and I watched it about the first 15 minutes. And I said, where is this thing going? I'm sorry. It's a very good story. It's actually like three stories all over the world. I don't care. It's not my kind of movie at all. Not even close. None of those guys are good looking her. That's not the... I wouldn't care what they looked like. That's not the point. I didn't fall asleep during that movie. You want to say a movie? I was a great movie. Oh! It's a manly movie. Yeah, that's why Roger Ebert, so enthusiastically endorses it. You know Roger. He's a man's man. Yeah. He's got a black wife though for tax purposes. You get more than for that. Yeah. Oh, and speaker that, did you ever... Was it power when Hurricane Wollon blew through? He's a question to start a fight. I see. But bad news for you when you already know this. You were good to know about it before the show. Richard, for you probably in total of free generators, chainsaw of the disaster recovery items courtesy of FEMA. In all you could take home up to $1676 and $65cent in free merchandise per household. FEMA won't go to the store and buy a generator, but if you apply online or by telephone, you'll become eligible. The snack or reimbursement check for Michael Sam for some or all of your purchase price. And what's to prevent a whole lotter for trying to filter second generator in the next hurricane? Anyone who suspects fraud, we invite them to call FEMA's fraud hotlines and the FEMA spokesman Jim Humstead at 1-800-323-8603. Residents applying for help must agree that they're trying to true the face criminal civil penalties including a fine of up to quarter of a million dollars in prison at our both and maybe even to the money is going to be efficacy next year. Last year, FEMA paid $185.6 million to provide more than 220,000 generators for Florida victims of hurricane Charles, Francis Ivan and Jeannie said FEMA spokesman moved to the Ascivado. No came to the Derrcastivado. He used to be a writer at Calder. FEMA's maximum reimbursement for a generator today is $835.97. Residents in 13 Florida counties better by Wilmer Clement Daden Browder, eligible for so-called other needs assistance that includes reimbursements for things like generators, reimbursements are based on price guidelines established for 50-haveter watch generators. Purchases of larger generators will reimburse based on a received the actual cost up to the guideline prices. Keith Ashdown, a spokesman for tax payers for common sense in the Washington D.C. non-partisan budget watchdog criticizes FEMA for what he calls given away too much money to people who really don't need the financial assistance. What they should do is have people prove their net worth and provide a sliding scale rebite Ashdown set. The government should get the generators back when the crisis is over, then figure out a way to make sure it doesn't by generators over and over for the same people. The government should get the generators back when the crisis is over, then figure out a way to make sure it doesn't by generators over and over for the same people. And 30 days. But 30 days. The native of Governor's Emergency Declaration, FEMA rules require that the dwelling where those items had to be used must be located in the declared area that suffered a verifiable power interruption. The power must be out when they buy an acivator said, FEMA's got to record when power was out in different areas. FEMA usually won't pay for generators purchased before the emergency declaration for Wilma. She said, you're so you're out of luck when you buy yours? Like months ago. Couple of days. Do the tax free week when we were supposed to take advantage of these things? Right. So here's a guy trying to be prepared. and he's going to get punished for it. When he's going to have his power, it still needs the generator. We don't pay for a preparedness, but if you have someone who's handicapped, saying they had to have a certain medical equipment or for our safety, it could be. It's on a case-by-case basis, as the video said. Florida can make the decision because it pays about 25% of the cost of FEMA's other needs assistance provided for its individual's and households program. FEMA provides disaster assistance to individuals, families, and businesses, where losses are not covered by insurance. FEMA won't pay to cover insurance deductibles, but will provide grants to help pay for temporary housing and home repairs, and other necessary expenses and serious needs caused by the disaster. Such expenses can be for medical, dental, moving and funeral needs. U.S. Small Business Administration provides low interest loans to cover some residential and business losses. The federal disaster unemployment assistance program also covers most people thrown out of working-footing many who do not normally qualify for regular unemployment aid. Scientists, more than increased hurricane activity with other strong resurms can be expected. I've had to generate an industry-like circumstances, but we have to have somebody to confirm that what happens next year. You're not fine-generalized for everybody against an Ashdown of taxpayers, which come and send so. So, if I'm in sensible sats, the other part of that story is they won't pay for the deductible. You're insurance deductible, even if it's $1,000, like, $1,000 insurance deductible, this. So, the moral of the story is, don't be prepared, don't be insured, via, you know, an F-head, and, you know, get a check. Get a check. I still dodge Yola would say. I did that. That's one thing I'll never get out of my mind. I'm sure you'll be able to get a check. As far as I'm concerned, he made out of been the very beginning of it, but he was definitely part of the dumbing of America, Joe Dodge Yola. I mean, as a literate, as the day is long, former mediocre catcher for the pirates and somebody else, Joe Garage Yola. It lit a bit. I bought a bunch of radio stations. He probably would like for any martes. But man, he was so, and they put him on the network. Get a check. Get a, get a, he was an all-ease sponsor, carousel sponsor. Get a check. And that was the beginning of the infrared stuff. Please do a Dodge Yola. 560, 560, the Pirates and SIGITER RIDE OF SLEAN. Do we want to take any more calls? I don't know. SIGITER RIDE OF SLEAN. I mean, we have our two regular rig in it right now. Yeah, I'm two and six. And now, how do you know that? Why are you so cynical? Because I'm probably right. I think it ringing continuously. All the while. I'm trying to tell us. I have no light. Oh, I knew that. WKWA in Hello. See you here wrong about that. You saw that with a, can't, I thought that was done. WKWA in Hello. And they're both like that. Well, I'm in round the line for a very long time. Oh, it was out. It's had a 96 anyway. WKWA in Hello. KWA in. What is it from across this tree? This is a lobe syphilis. Is this going to be syphilis? Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah. Yeah, I thought for a bit. What is it? It's off and so. No. No. No. Get a light. Go get your light from the crap. It's off and song my ass. Yeah, you've been a dolphin's. Yeah, yeah. God. I'm going to read this story to how it is stupid as called. Good. UN warns of poverty as world's legs evaporate. This is from the financial times by a Fiona Harvey. I wonder if Fiona's can depile Harvey, but I've done it. Who is the end of that new tree? It's been a long time. Thanks very much, Paul Harvey, but I found it myself. And then it was amazing because yesterday was a discussion that would be for the show. And I said, one of the most of me, I was telling about skin, you're rocking and peeling and drying. And you said it before I did. Right. I said, have you tried new Virginia? You're looking at a tub of it right in the bathroom. Oh, right. Is this, oh, try it on your feet. Smeared on my feet? Yeah. It's going to be a little on your back dome. You can't hurt. No, especially if it's shaping. Lates around the world are shrinking and becoming less productive because of climate change, pollution, for irrigation practices and neglect the United Nations for India today. African lakes are among the worst affected with satellite images unveiled on Monday, showing dramatic differences between the extent of some lakes and rivers today. And the restent of few decades ago, Lake Chad has shrunk by almost 90%. While water levels in Lake Victoria, Africa's biggest freshwater lake are full and by a meter since the early 90s. New year has lost more than 80% of its freshwater wetlands in the past 20 years. They used to be Nigerian, else New Year. Clouds tougher as a director of the UN's environmental programs said economically, lakes are of huge importance. I hope that the satellite images will ring a warning around the world that if we're to overcome poverty and meet internationally agreed development goals by 2015, the sustainable management of Africa's life's most important equation. Otherwise, we face increasing tensions in stability, rising populations compete for life's most precious of resources. For sterilization, I'm sorry. Lates in waterways are potential science points for conflicts between countries as the pressure of demand for freshwater fuels. This fuels disagreement over how to share the resource. Delegates to the 11th World Lake Conference in Kenya, heard that the Volta River Basin West Africa shared by, and I have no idea out of pronounced affities countries, with a particular source of concern. Topulation levels around the Basin expected double the 40 meters over the next two decades, causing a sharp rise to demand for water. Did I say 40 meters 40 million? Oh. Well, I don't know. It's all this brick crap. Rainfall and river flows in the area of decline over the past 30 years. Not turning the party into decline with change. Report from the UN program, an University of Oregon and the US concluded current water use patterns in the Volta Basin have already stressed the available resources almost to their limits. It will be increasingly difficult to satisfy additional demands. Legal agreements among country-sharing water sources should be strengthened, or to avoid potential conflicts in the future reports, and the US said, countries could also be in front of the United Nations and the US, and as well as agriculture and drinking water. For example, in the US, the recreational value of freshwater's for activities from rafting to fishing is estimated about $37 billion a year. Why are we worried about such tandy as things as the environment, the lakes, the global warming, and the mending polar ice caps are all these things? Probably worried about such things. Since the ice caps are melting, maybe they could move some to those lakes. There you go. When in that funnel alone down. Let's see now, there's this UN, I don't want to read the whole thing, but if you want to see it in the US, you want to see it in Gallup pool. Why is it? Why can't they just have a name for it? I hate that. That was taken up a weekend. You approved this approved by the majority of the WSNs having his job as president. Approved 41% disapproved 56% no opinion. I have no life. Three. I can have no opinion. Thinking about the following characteristics and qualities, please say about the you think it applies, it doesn't apply to George W. Strong and decisive leader. Applies 52% doesn't apply 47. His honest interest worthy applies to 49 doesn't apply 48. Can manage the government effectively. Applies 43% doesn't apply 56%. Got it? Got it. And the numbers are getting worse. It's got the list of all the tools taken back over the last several months. And getting worse and worse. How about Dick Cheney? For example, here now, I'm not thinking ahead. You think the remaining three years, he judged WSNs, who be a success or a failure. Success 41% failure 55%. Since the start of his presidency in 2001, when you say his presidency, the success of failure, success 42% of failure 55%. Dick Cheney, favorable rating 42% unfavorable 51% never hurt him 2%. That's a phone call. Surprise at that low. Oh my God, that is just that is kind of a scary. In of course, I'm sure that I know that he probably a couple of more. We don't know them all by name, but we hear from them virtually every day. 154 at Q&A, the Momeysur from New York at 2. This is Neil Rogers. This is 560. Number 1, David! The Middle Eastern world will be exploded to do that people do with the gas that we sold him. First time a Chris or nation and they only won that's going. Now more blood will be spilled to get that oil flowing. Forget about Korea and the nuclear potion and the right queen is really sober and over to our head. And Iraq has some patterns of past destruction. 3,000 people killed. I'm now forgotten. Let's exploit him instead. And there's oil to be found. So in after some time to make NATO sum up, there's no longer mention of the name in lotting. But no it's even $3,000. And the whole country and the places believe in every word of this heart-telling administration. 2,000 drove us by fear through the enemy manipulation and the right queen is really sober and over to our head. And Iraq has some patterns of past destruction. 4,000 people killed. The last civil rights is that right that we're paying. We're all suspects now not see us from this same. I have nothing to hide. People talk as all are saved. I know being in cattle don't have any reservations. Thousands of folks battle and world annihilation. Over the Nile, each and all regime must fall. And how the Virgin is known, with no objection at all. And the cracker will have the fall and the right queen is really dead over to our brain wise parents. Iraq has some patterns of past destruction. Only I'd ride myself with this vast structure. Bye bye bye! When it comes to sports, I'm already dying, boy! We can take out the authority. But we're looking for you by 60, till we can win. My heavy fourth mark in. If you want to try it, okay? No thanks. I prefer a grass. You're fairie.
