This would be the random center when it was the national car rental party. Yes, it's the center. Very good. Hey, Elton, you're fair. Anyway, you're responsible for really destroying most of my day yesterday. You watched that, didn't you? Yeah, I know you. I went to lunch. No, no, if it wouldn't have been for you and every mood of dream to turn like that. It was pretty fascinating stuff. It was a fascinating only from the standpoint of two things. Number one, displaying what a tremendous waste of time and taxpayer money was. Once a bunch of bubbleheads we got in Congress. And number two, showing what a bunch of lying TV. You know, I got a Jose's book right here and I want my money, but you're the one who went out and bought it. It took him two years to write it and that's why in the meantime he changed his mind. All of a sudden. So I think there ought to be a big sticker on here saying, oh, don't buy this because since I wrote it, it's all stale. I changed my mind and steroids be bad. You know, I'm going to tell you, Eliana Ross, late in the middle of the day. Thank you very much. This is the Mochi is the poster child for everything that's wrong with Miami. That bitch. You know, something new. She didn't ask one question. No, you know, you were rambling. You know, I'm asking one question. I'll tell you what I said at the beginning of the show about. She was like to see and write, how does this remind you of anything? I'm going to have to excuse myself. But before I go, I would like to say that Mr. Corleoni is one of the most prominent rich sitting in the father. And I want to say something about the Italian American. You know, this doctor, you could talk about bowling and she would find some way to turn it away. Cuba, Fidel thing. I mean, you could be talking about selling what kind of home and touch. You're going to eat it for him. And she could talk it into a Cuban Fidel thing. She is the most obnoxious disgusting, simple, vintage, whoever came down to pike. And I'm not sure who looked more stupid. Her Jose or Mark, I don't want to talk about the past, McGuire. And then, of course, born again, occurred chilling with his god and a repubines. You don't stand that girl. Oh, man. I think, Sammy, you know, what one of the highlights was, you could just slip at the time. But one of the cognizment called Sammy. So so. Mr. So So. That was great. I love you, my, I mean, I don't know. So I believe on it. It was my entertainment and it was worth it. What? It was worth taxpayer money for me. No, it was not high entertainment. Every time that I had to another question, they'd go up and down. I can't answer that. I don't know. I'm going to say about that. Yeah, I agree with the current. Yeah. I'm debating to say it. It revealed a lot to me. Like what? Like what? Like the whole problem with the whole deal is Donald Fiery. I'm going to start with that bud ceiling is the congressman from Shilling's district in Boston or from the Red Sox district. It was great. He didn't like Shilling off the hook. Shilling said, well, we can, we can police ourselves in this matter. And he said, well, you've been telling us that for 30 years. And anyone back there to me. Boy, Q and being there 30 years ago say, yeah, steroids was a problem. And yet this commissioner claims he knew nothing about it. 20 years after that. Yeah. I mean, it tells you everything. That was one of the Republicans from Indiana was pretty good too. But every 10 years they're getting a little bit tough. The chairman would interrupt while all the house rules say that any public testimony, we can't, you know. And then they would say, and plus you're out of time anyway. So shut up. Yeah. So they never really let him go after anybody. I thought, I thought, I thought, man, for me. I mean, I had never seen him in some kind of public setting before. Manfred Man. That guy is ridiculous. Yeah. And he's a guy who negotiates for the owners. But what was a is the color of money man? Jose can say go. 16, street. Ross Layton sitting there talking about Ashie. What? This school of block away from the park where he went to school. And how she hopes to go with talk to those kids about bad steroids. Does he? Well, she was a little busy, but she especially wants to come and her good post personal friends, Raffee and Sammy. Yeah. Sammy who had the court fat. Yeah, Sammy, who all of a sudden is Dominican turned a Cuban. She, by the way, looks like she's been doing steroids herself. She's a little fucked up. Her head looks like a guy who's a man. I think her hair do a guy who looks like her husband. I guess you'd be doing pills too, you know. Yeah. Oh, brother. I remember the little person going on probably to much with this Terry Shavobin. If you think yesterday's hearings were really captivating, wait till Terry, Terry's going to be called to invited the testify before Congress. This is the scan that they're pulling to prevent them from removing the tube. I want to clock today. They're calling her to testify. So as a result, if anybody interferes with that, it's going to be a federal crime and they'd better not mess with that tube. They're just, actually, she is right now. Of course, you're going to go there. She's going to go testify. And I want to say that would be very captivating. I don't think she'll probably see more than Mark McGuire did. I'll tell you, I'd like the representative from Missouri too. Who he asked McGuire some tough questions, which he didn't answer. And then he referred to the highway named after Mark McGuire like it's an embarrassment. He was very good, you're right. He was terrific. He wanted to kneel him to the cross. But this all happened yesterday, right? Yep. Well, just remember one thing. We're not here to talk about the past. That's right. That's all he had here to look at the weekend. I'm not going to lose him much. He was still embarrassing. I mean, he had Roy's written all over his red, uh, pimpley, groutesca face. I have a question for you, Neil. Yes. And somebody wrote this in the Boston Globe today, uh, a writer where we always speak. One of the problems is we don't have any comments down here. You can go to the reading and good about this. But, uh, Sean is he, Dan Sean is he in Boston wrote that he thinks this could cause McGuire a problem with the whole of fame. Do you agree? Who cares? Oh. Don't want to talk to you. Or it's serious. No, no, that's not it. It's not a question. Tom and sports. I mean, just who cares? I mean, Ty Cobb, I believe we did this before. I told you, as a member of the Ku Klux Klant, this is not him from getting in. Everybody knew that. I mean, it's that they brought Pete Rose's name up. Pete Rose and she. This has nothing to do with the writing. I mean, I asked you this, okay? Who do you think is the biggest slime ball, the biggest lower, the worst low life, Mark McGuire or Pete Rose? And I agree with you, Pete Rose belongs in there because it should be because you know what, I don't think that has any, you do with Pete Rose being in a hall of time. No, I do. I have a question. Answer the question Mr. Perinoia, who do you think is the biggest slime ball, because they both belong in their Mark McGuire or Pete Rose? Yeah, I'm not talking about what happened yesterday. Mark McGuire is a, he's like a, a Boy Scout compared to Pete Rose. Yeah, but Pete and Pete, I am near, you, you are arguing with yourself because I agree with you. He belongs in there, but that's not my question. In terms of low life, this is Grace, my God. Yeah, Pete, this is a great, I think I class guy in a world. Oh, please, this is a story about him at the race track. He makes Larry King look a lot. I don't just sign for anymore years. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Three more years. This is a news, by the way, we don't want to talk about that. I said that over to you. I'm glad you got it. What? The Larry King. That's yesterday's news that was on yesterday. Oh, was, oh, yeah, was it. What was it going on in the park about yesterday? We're not here to talk about the past. We're here to talk about Larry's future for about another six months to leave Croaks. Well, he in an hour. You know, something that I bigger part of, he in an hour. Well, you mean extending their contract. Yeah, we're talking about croaking. He has a matter of fact, R&R radio and records since I scour all these websites. Got a big piece here about Howard David's signs with whatever that, yeah, whatever that thing is sports USA radio. Maybe he'll give him a talk show. Now, see, you're just trying to get rid of him now. He, I heard him the other day say that he was bonding with you in a hallway. You and he had a great chat about something. I was just listening. Yeah. I would say it was more of a bond bonding. I wouldn't exactly call it a one. So would you call that a bonding what we were doing there? No. No. That's not the two you're getting pretty tight now. Hey, listen, we got to be one big happy family. We got that stiff competition now, man. Yeah, with emphasis on stiff. Yeah, that's my point. Well, you have a nice weekend, Neil. I'm going to. And I'm going to watch an on-prem. That was yesterday. I'm going to think about your question. I asked you, I'm Monday. Monday will find out from Hank, who's the biggest, the bigger low-life, Mark McGuire or Pete Rose. Have you ever seen Pete at the track? Oh, I sat with him at the track. Oh, is that why you don't want to answer the question? I know Pete pretty well. And I, oh, geez. Don't tell him your friends with Pete Rose. I didn't say that. I know. I said, I know. Oh, my God. That would be, I don't know what to. I'm probably fall right on the floor if you told me that. I lose my faith in life. But I've seen Pete's thoughts. Oh, when he sits down, but I stack $100 bills with whichever fluency happens to be sitting at his side. And sits and stacks up to 100s like he's impressing you. And then, of course, you watched them diminish like the amazing and visible man. It is just a very rapidly. Maybe Monday, I'll tell you the story about Pete and the teller at the Gulf Stream. I could tell you the story about Pete and dealers in Las Vegas. Yeah. Probably the same thing as what you're going to go. They still have the Larry King ador, where they have all those checks that Larry bounced. No, they don't have this. Nothing left at Gulf Stream. It's. You're not everything down. That is a true story, by the way. They had a ador where they had all the Larry King's bad checks once upon a time. That was for you. I thought that was I, Leah. Now, or whatever it was, or one of each. Some place that doesn't exist anymore. Yeah. Probably I, Leah. But you know something? That's in the past. That's right. We're not going to look back at the time when Larry was a five percent of it. Highlight. Right. We don't want to talk about him. Stiffing all those people for the book he was allegedly writing. They never wrote. But one of these days he's going to pay them all back. You'll see. In fact, some of them died already. Got that big fat guy that used to sell dog food in my health food story. He died already. Larry, old him, five grand. You got the kids. No. I would meet people I had never saw before in my life. They'd start out in nowhere. You know Larry King, I'd say, oh, my that son of a bitch ripped me off her five grand. He made up these stories. He was right now fucking. Yeah. Right. Never saw him again. There is, I would say if you had to take a pull on the luckiest man in the face of ear, if there's the one right there, only for Stiffos. Sit. Just sit there by the phone. You're going to get a call. All right. Now Bill Vines is going to call you. You're going to be doing my show. What a BS artist man of the worst kind. But it goes to show a kiss and ask. Can you get you all the way to the top man? Well, he told me that that very same thing. He was one who told Bill Vines that I should inherit his show when he left. And do some more. Only the same things. I guess we were both maybe we can't sell each other up. But then again, you know something, Hank, that was in the past. That's right. Can't hold a grudge against Larry. You know, Larry could have paid all those people back. And I asked him about it one time and he's exactly what he said. That was my other life. Really? Yeah. Nice guy. I can millions and millions and millions and millions and he such a low life. Maybe that would be our discussion on Monday. Okay. Who's the bigger low life? Larry King, Mark McGuire or Pete Rose. I think I'm going to be out on Monday. I'm going to. I need immunity. If I don't have immunity, I'm not showing up. Well, it's either going to be you testify or Terry Shive. One of the other. I'll go for Shive. Yeah. See you just make up your mind. Maybe just make gutterwell sounds at 10 o'clock. Good. Quart TV stuff this week. Really? Well, look at all these trials that have been going on. That's true. Robert Blake, the attorney for the, the, the, the trailer trailer. The attorney for the trailer trash family says I'm going to wipe that smile right off his face. And now he wants to act again. He needs the money. The real is that what he said, but he's going to need a lot of money when he has to pay that civil suit. I still say the bitch had to come in. If he didn't do a Christian brand or what it done, it's somebody else for what she was just in the nasty conniving. You know, I agree. But again, then again, that's in the past. I hope they had a good meal of that Italian restaurant. You know, so there's always an Italian restaurant in the mix like with OJ's sparks. Yeah. Always in Italian restaurant. Sparks wasn't an Italian restaurant. I was a steakhouse. Oh, sorry. Whatever. That was too much this weekend. I'll try not to. I might just have to go out there and give it a shot this weekend. You know, yeah, I'll be up and I have a Palm Beach counter club for me tomorrow. Warm up my machines again. See if I can get that then cranking for three four grand. You know, some good three-year-old races. Kind of nice when at five times we look for it in five times come up in the bill starts ringing. You know, all the best here. All the best here. All the best here. All the best here. You have a great weekend. And you know, in a lot. Actually, you want to say yesterday. I want to have to know. You took a day out of my life. That's all I can tell you. It was worth it. It was. See a great day weekend. Yeah, you too. I get half whatever you win. Monday. I was going to go down on Pete Rose. Yes, sorry.pload sip. Ok, I see. I guess. Let's go. Okay... MM Dude that's circling thrash Goodbye Chris Barley, you great big fatty, always acting like a great big fat dump retard and every film you'll ever pay.

It's violent Pablo B.T. programming the show that it's always that's going to be fra. We know Kurt Cobain, dad of a self-insic gigant shot, but it was because of drugs and our research all of these very thoroughly and completely in whoever wrote true on here, Miguel, always full of crap. Did you write that? Yeah, it is true. No way. Well, technically it's true, but it was in two slides. I agree. Technically it's true, but yes. I'm not interested in corrections to the pool. If you want additions that's fine, corrections the answer is absolutely. No, no. Okay. That was yesterday. We're here to talk about today. Fonscott from ACDC fine. They got it since not online yet. They don't know what they were talking about. Well, we're like kind of backed up for time here, you know. Which is fine with me for time. Enjoy those. Oh, no, look at this. Phil Hartman for the pool and in your right on this. Phil Hartman had nothing to do with drugs or booze. He was shot by his crazy wife, put in shot herself. Steve from Nashville. Steve, we just haven't even started the show yet. If they should leave already, they're like, got a million things for the pool. What is with you people? Anyway, it was something he got saying, why does dancing your pants? Too much watching him hearings with Jose Cansoco. Man, you talked about crap. I'm really still in my mind, not sure who I would point the finger at is being the most disgraceful. I still think Eliana Rosanna Dana, although very much expected. I mean, but there was nobody else there. Did anything that was unexpected either. You know, my choir was going to stone wall because he's a bad abuser. Big time. And all those records of his are totally bogus. You know, Sammy's going to go, I know that no speaker in the ladies. You know, I know that. You know, I know that. How do you like who was the one always a cooconent? Who asked him a question in this, Bonnie, how did you like that? Did you see that? No. Little Dennis cooconent with a crappy hairpiece. He asked him a question in this, Bonnie, and Sammy said, Oh, great. That's Sammy so so by the way. Sammy so so. So so. And of course, Coach, show and he's still he's praying in God. And his in the Republican. Oh, get out of here already. You make me want to puke. And Jose, of course, he just had to change your heart. Oh, God. Let me do the yesterday's poll real quick. Because once I get going today, man, I may go to midnight. The radio talks show host do dislike the most yesterday. We had 19, every 68 votes. We could have done 2000 judge by headed chopper off there at nine to put today's poll on there. Of course. Could have easily, that going over well over 2000. Rush Limbaugh, he went almost over a thousand by himself. 846 speaking of fat and pills. Sean handed he won 55. We see that like about six five times as many of them. Sean handed he won 55. Little judge Rodriguez is on vacation for week one forty five. Give it a good shot there, George. But couldn't nail down second place. Bill or Riley 92, more Howard David. No no no no no no no no no no no no no no. 89. Dan LeBastard 80. Al Franken 66. Howard's current 65. Todd Smith had 56. The Humper was tied with Michael Savage 53. I don't think we'll see the two of them in school together. Randy Rhodes 41. Steve Kane and yours truly 28 of P. Scrape mines work alike. Glenn Beck and Phil Henry 26. Yeldy 25 25. O'Jam McDuffie 19. Jerry Springer 16. The big O'Had 11. D Gordon LiD 10. Ed Schultz 9. Ed Schultz 9. How could that Schultz have 9? Nobody knows who that is. D.4 had 9. The mad dog had a rat. This was respectful. The booster is 6. Yo Rose 3 and little Eddie K. Had 3. That's yesterday's poll. We don't want to talk about yesterday. Monica Bluechi, not to be confused with John Bluechi, is on today's web-beaded curtain thing. Monica Bluechi was born in O'Had 11. Cheitade Castello, O'Merei Italy. Cheitade Castello. That's the city of Lucas, Stella. Born September 30, 1964, which makes her 40, 40. Right? She's in the centricity, which has been made next year, not even this year. Comprehension to Ganyis is being filmed right now. The brothers grim, completed but not out yet. The maitors online, she hate me. Oh, she hate me. Agency grits the passion of the Christ. Did you know that she was Monica Bluechi was in that? The passion? The passion of the Christ. I did, yeah. I didn't see it. I know what happened. Well, thank God. Friends of Persia Warrior within the maitors for evolution, sin bad, legend of the seven seas, and of the maitors. The maitors related, run out of the maitors. Have fun with the maitors. Here's the son, Rickordante de May. You're a reversible, asterisk, and obelix. And a whole bunch of others. The other suspicion, I made it to Rani's. A los Caman. Lucimo, Lluvimo, Cabadano. Whatever it is, I mean, what does that mean? You tell me, Lluvimo, Cabadano. I think that's something about the Capo regime. I don't know what that means. The apartment, she's in a whole bunch of stuff. Anyway, Monica Bluechi, she looks fine. We got to get more than one picture. How many pictures we got up there? I would think you could... Stop, third man! Couple. The other thing is, the prices right now, the Terry Shive Othink, before we get to the... I just got too much here to handle. I'm gonna pass on. Too much stress, too much pressure. A lot of pressure. Employing an extraordinary, congressional maneuver, House Republican leadership, early in the day, made a last-ditch effort to keep doctors from removing the feeding tube of Terry Shive Othink. And they're gonna do it. I have to do it over Bill Frist's fist. I'll tell you that right now. Because he is pissed off and fired up. He is invited Terry and her husband, Michael, to appear and testify before her kids committee. In the Senate. Also, the House invited them to appear. In fact, they got a subpoena from Dennis Hester, Tom D'Lay, and Tom Davis. They subpoenaed them to appear. Terry Shive Othink, you're gonna have to... You've got testimony. That ought to be really riveting. If you enjoyed yesterday at the baseball stuff, or the steroids, you'll read it up when Terry has her moment in the sunshine. And says, Like that. Now, what she's gonna say? Yeah, something like that. Terry, how do you feel about that too, honey? Like that. That's bad. That's really disrespectful. But I think that's about all she could say at this point. If that. So, of course, this show I tremendous ways to manage you. This is your Congress at Work Ladies and Your Honor, where Pan-like $80 a gallon of gas now. We've got millions of people with no health care. We've got the people down over the next meal is coming from. We've got this enormous deficit. The American dollar is like worth $15. And we're worried about the steroids in baseball, and let's buy all means keep that tube in Terry's nose. Okay. That's right. That's right. We've got our head on straight man. We've got our priorities all straight and now it went into our straight and that baby out. Can we still say that? No, like I said, it's more like it. 1026 at 5.60 WQM.

Bring the view in as you will win. Good guys, I had so much fun to give, but you married a psychotic thing. A drink of finger got his hitch. But the producers said, cheap new herself for wedding cos everybody knows that it's LA. They let burgers walk every day. Another last-to-her-side, thanks to your psychobit-wife who had a stupid day flight. My friend, had news radio, was a main show except that you were there. And some characters from the shit that lost their bones. You felt more that this your life would have lasted long, which he left you no choice. Good-side, droid and flung, that you made a front-sup. Film dad, dad, sorry that I heard a rum on hands, a gun. And hurt me, I just feel your head all. Now, line on how to get rid of all. She's dead anyway. Saturday night, I'm falling for the indecase since that the reason you let any way. I've got such a bad guy, those of your psychotic wife, with that stupid day flight grip. And the Simpson will bear the worst day again. And I saw his right jaw, as soon as he could find the wrong. And he said, good things are said, because now they've had the fence that big. You have for a while. Okay, well, I didn't want to leave the tube, but that's why you go to a store about that. So, I'll leave it to Friday. Well, we all hit at the same time, I'm sure. Didn't we get on? Yes. Good. Anyway, I wanted to worry about it there. We can't say anymore, which is kind of sad, because that bit was from a few years ago. But nevertheless, so anyway, we're to watch start. Now, see, here's Jimmy, who means well, pretty prints committed suicide by shooting himself. We already know that there's only OIC. What does that mean? You don't understand the background. I understand he committed suicide just like Kurt Cobain did. But the fact that the matter is there was drugs, drugs, drugs, drugs. That's what it was all about, okay? Lots of it. So, I don't really know what this says. He's trying to look like an incorrect pull. I did like hours of research. I poured. Oh, I might have been speaking to Kurt Cobain. If you really want to, if you have a lot of extra time on your hands, you have no life. I have no life. I'll go online and even find 44,000 different conspiracy theories about how Kurt Cobain really died and why. And butterbeat, butterboat, but does anybody really care quite that much? Oh, no. You care? No. So we care about Kurt and he loves. No, absolutely not. She's shot a movie. What? She shot him. There you go. Anyway, now, here's the pull for today. And I want to get to this Jose Consocco book. And I don't want to do a lot of reading from there. As we go, reading it up, said, all the way, we don't care. Who is your all-time favorite celebrity who died from drugs or booze? That doesn't necessarily mean that the instant that they stopped reading, that the immediate cause was. But, you know, the drugs and booze, you can't separate that if you're going to talk about Kurt Cobain and his death. And same with Freddy Prince. So if you want to send me a stupid fax, go ahead. If you want to do a little research first and read up about these people, then you'll find out that as usual I tend to be. A lot of mistakes, like showing up some days, but believe you me when I tell you, okay, we know our Freddy Prince. Kurt Cobain was doing heroin. Right. He just got out of rehab for crying out loud when his brains were blown out. And of course, then there's a question about was he murdered and he really do it. You know, although quite practically it's a lot more significant to, I think, the human race than are the baseball players doing steroids. You know, that whole thing yesterday, there are people out there who really believe that this is worthwhile and a useful expenditure of your taxpayer time and money for the Congress of the United States, the House of Representatives to be conducting hearings with a bunch of stupid jokes and asking, Oh, did you take Roy? Is it anybody else around you? Take Roy? Did you take a shot and they go, huh? It's for the children. Yeah, right. They're alive. And that's my point. That's why I'm doing this pull today and I show you how ridiculous it is because in show business, actors, actresses, certainly musicians, there are just as many and probably a hell of a lot more widely publicized stories about superstars doing Airbeak and drug that's ever been invented, something I've ever heard of, and a hell of a lot more controversial than Slicing steroids. And yet are we having hearings about those? Oh, should we be having hearings about those? No. Absolutely not. Now let's see, for today's pull Bradley Noll from Sublime, died of a heroin overdose. Well, that's good. I hope next time you do this pull, we can put on Mark McGuire. Oh, yeah, we can put on Mark McGuire and his bitch ass alligator tears. When every seven of them had a chop his legs off like that boxer, whatever steroids. And of course it's horrible that those people they were testifying and he lost their kids committed to a side. But you know something? How many other kids killed themselves with drugs because they were emulating some rock star, huh? And by the way, for that stupid bitch congress, well, womanica, out there's not 500, it's 500,000 eighth and tenth graders who have been using steroids, not 500. She just had a little bit of a mischievous thing. That's what she says. He said 500. Yeah, the number was 500,000, but nevertheless only a couple of off, you know, idiotic bitch. So here's what we got on a pull so far. And I'm sure that there are some more and a lot of dead performers because of drugs and booze. Especially the drug part. I mean, the idea that it's just laughable on the face of it. Let me say it again, alienarostly, then any, I hope there is nobody in this audience who ever votes for her. I know that she wins hands down because she's got that old, the green tooth crowd again. I hope that the girls certainly know that in your family ever voted for that bitch. Well, both of them have votes, so it's all right. Good. Put them back on a banana boat, okay? Get them out of here. Dammit. She is such an embezzled. She didn't ask anybody any questions. Nothing to run answers for it coming anyway, but that was supposed to be the process. She was not asking questions. She makes a five-minute speech about, uh, rap A and how much we respect, rap A and Samy and Boba Boba. I'm laughing wouldn't go and play against Padel and against the Cuban National team because he wouldn't even buy a Castro and how we have the sweet name after Jose right down the block of the school and I went to school and walk away. Oh, my god, almighty. And thanks, right. She's just like that, just like that scene in the, uh, in the godfather. Where he's tends to think about the attack and people are wonderful. People may have never been ever so afraid to rain and she's going out about the Cuban people. You know, something alienator disgrace to the human race. And Rosanna, Rosanna, Dan of the real one. She's got to be turned over in her grave, you know. Seriously, turning over in her grave. I bet you that the Jean Wilder would like to come there and just take a Louisville slugger or knock her head right off her shoulders. Her fat head off her fat shoulders. Man, that that performance she put in yesterday, that was one for the record books with no asterisk. You're all time favorite celebrity who died from drugs, your art booze or whatever. John Bollushi, no contest 89. Jimmy Hendrix 42, you know, fat and drugs is not a good combination either. Fat and anything. Jimmy Hendrix 42, Elvis 39, Chris Farley 34, speaking of fat, Marlon Monroe 19, Kurt Colbert 11. He shot himself, you know. Janice Jopflin 10, Lenny Bruce A. Charlie Parker 7, said, Vicious 6 River Phoenix 6. I thought you're not dead to that. Jack Harrow Act 6, John Bonham, Led Zeppelin 5, William Holden 5, that would have bottled in his hand. William Holden was great, but he was a drunk, Freddie Prince 4, Keith Moon of the Hoofore, Shannon Hoon of Clyde Mellon, Shannon Hoon. You know, so I keep moving, I thought I'd stop him, Shannon Hoon. Okay, I mean, of course. He's quite a bum. Looking up. We loved Lymell and Owen. Lymell's pretty good. Why? You have that song stuck in my head. What do you mean by that? I love that. Yeah, it's a good song. Anyway, he's dead, Shannon Hoon. Judy Garland 4, TV Ramone 2, Bobby Hamfield, Vicious 2, Andy Gibb 2, Steve Clark, Death Levered 2, Bradley Noll, Sublime 1, John Phillips, Mama's and Papa's. One Frankie line on the teenagers, Frankie. All right. That's what the Frankie line in guy. He's dead, drugs. Brian Jones of the Stones one, David Ruffin 1, Tim Tations, Montgomery Cliff 1, Hey Montgomery, Tony. No, that's not what I want to say. You're fair. That's it. Gene Vincent Nunn and Phil line it. Lynn it. Lynn it. Then Lizzy. Feet 120 to go. A lot of dead performers. Let me say it again. And when we after the break, I just a couple of paragraphs again from Jose Concecco's book. And keep in mind, if you went out there, I got stuck in a binable. And you're money back because, well, it took two years to write the book. And now I've changed my mind. And let me tell this crap about the steroids. Maybe you look so young. You could pass for 55 easy sweet. Make me look like a clean one. 160. Another edition of, What, eh, today? What if Jan is jufflin? We're an avon lady. No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Yes, man, help you. You can take my life away, my life away. Who are we, my neighbor? Who are we, my neighbor? Who are we, my neighbor? Who are we, my neighbor? Who are we, my neighbor? Who are we, my neighbor? Well, Julian next time, Do find out what would happen if Nancy Reagan lost weight. This bulletin just ends in a pierce. The first lady has disappeared. We're next, we ask. What? 1026, 14. There's a lot of left-of-grants kids. We got Mohour David who just signed with Sports USA radio. Mohour David did it too. We got to Mad Dog at four. And then seven, and he's a Mad Dog by the way, at public system on South Andrew's Avenue and four. Lawterdale. Wow. He is reading move up in the world, you know. Curtis Stevenson said it at head and that we have a guilty free Friday and it he kids in a clock. That's our schedule at QAM. Match that Danny boy. Okay, here's a fact from John who says, Well, if you have the loser from Nirvana on it, and you certainly need to put my hero, how to rest Thompson on your hero. All I can say to that is, get him on or 100 S Thompson. She's drunk. Okay, here's what he can say goes book again. What's the good thing I bought this, you know? Did you want to read more? No. Oh. Well, I know actually I went through the S and to try to find some of the stuff that one congressman was reading. Did you see that when he read it to him? No. And again, the response from O's A with the straight face was, well, it took two years to write this book since that I've changed my mind. See, this is because he didn't, this is because he's testifying without immunity, and obviously it's going to be a parole violation. His big ugly ass is going to be back in his slamer. He's going to have the ankle bracelet on again when he goes home. He's going to have to have his visits to my house for 1500 bucks an hour to have a coffee conlature, whatever it is doing there. Give me a break. You lie in sack of crap. And of course, by his performance in his behavior, he raises grave doubts on everything you wrote in the book. All of them are a liar thing. There is no doubt. Well, of course, I mean, the book was definitely just a paycheck. That's all. He just wanted the money. I would think, well, we don't doubt that, but the obvious question is, did he want the money by spilling the beans with the truth? Or did he just make a lot of it out? That's the question. We know he wanted the money. He's desperate. I'd say, if I already guess, I'd say it's like 50-50. Did he fit in? How much would he bet? 50 cent? That's it. Anyway, here, I just, I know McGill gets re-obset all the way. I have a lot of stuff to read here. Then I read, you know, care what McGill thinks, because he's brain-he and alienator was an adanauty, you look. I mean, McGill's got a lovely wife, but I think I think that if you ever decide to dump your ass, I think alienator was an adanaut, because at least you didn't have that purple face like her husband. Jose says, we're talking about the future here. See, just like Mark McWire, not the past. And I'm not talking about yesterday. We're talking about the future. Jose says, I have no doubt whatsoever that intelligent informed use of steroids, combined with human growth hormone will one day be so accepted that everybody will be doing it. This is what I spent 36-95 Canadian-egotten by a wealth spent. And now, he changes his mind. Every one of you, every one of you suckers like me who bought the book, you should demand every fun immediately, not sooner. I'm going to read that sentence again. I have no doubt whatsoever that intelligent informed use of steroids, combined with human growth hormone will one day be so accepted that everybody will be doing it. Steroid use of more common than Botox is now. Every baseball player and pro-acly will be using at least low levels of steroids. Every baseball player and pro-acly says Jose the Mavin. As a result, based on how this force will be more exciting and entertaining, human life will be improved to we will live longer and better and maybe we'll live law. What? We will love longer and better, too. He says, oh yeah, he looks like a real specimen. We'll be able to look good and have strong faith bodies well in the worst 60s and beyond. It's called evolution and there's no stopping it. All these people crying about steroids in baseball now will look as foolish in a few years. As the people who said John Kennedy was crazy to say the US will put him in on the moon. People who see the future earlier than others are always feared and misunderstood. Now Jose, now they will fear you. The public needs to be informed about the reality of steroids and how they've affected a lot of some baseball players including me. Have I used steroids? You bet I did. It steroids make me a better baseball player of course they did. If I had it all to do over again, would I live a steroid in rich life? Yes, I would. Do I have any regrets or crimes about relying on chemicals to help me in a baseball so far to be honest? No, I don't. Now here's the next page page three. This is right off the get right to the box. Right at the gift go here and then begin in the book pages two and three. He says, yes, you heard me right. Stairwise used correctly will not only make you stronger in sex here. They'll also make you a healthier. This is better living through modern chemistry. You understand. Certain steroids used in proper combinations can cure a certain disease. Stairwise will give you a better quality of life and also drastically slow down the aging process. If people learn how to use steroids and grow home on properly, especially as they get older, 60, 70, 80 years old. Their way of living will change completely. If you start young enough when you're in your 20, 30s and 40s and use steroids properly, you can probably slow the aging process by 15 or 20 years. I'm 40 years old, but I look much younger. He says, likely story. And I can still do everything the way I could when I was 25. Again, I'm sure referring to his sorts ofmanship, which quite frankly, we don't want to hear about. At least I don't. Now we go back to page 283 toward the Ascent of the book. See, I did read to a couple of paragraphs Josh right on. And I apologize when you get the book. We'll have some paragraph circle. They'll be a little inking there. I'll be all right. I think I'll do a couple of dog eared pages. You can handle that. Yeah, I didn't have to pay the photo. That's right. You asked it's only a bargain. It's only 25.95. Plus the recap of the tax and tax. By the way, thank you, Mr. President, for those bargain gas prices over three dollars a gallon already in California and coming to a gas station here, you very soon. Thank you, and I'll present it for those low gas prices. Oh, my God. You fare exactly. Now, getting back to the book. There's no more pretending what we have to look forward to is a world where, honestly, about steroids is the only policy that challenge is going to be demonstrating to people. That steroids could be a good thing. I've never said it'll be easy to educate the American public about all this to get them to a simpler biochemistry and bio-technology could do to change our lives. We're only really getting started on that national conversation and we're in for an awkward period as the revelations about steroids start to sink in. In the short term, we can count on plenty of people urging baseball to crack down to wipes the Royce out of the game. What I'm hoping for says Jose Consocco is that some more intelligent forward-looking voices will come out and urge baseball to embrace the potential of steroids to fight for their place in the game and in our lives. Does that sound like what he was saying yesterday? Or no, he changed his mind because he doesn't want to go back in a slam where this slime ball you. And there's Iliana Rosanna Dana, which killed her right in her very sorry, by the way, honey, we apologize. Rosanna Dana given us some evidence and he allowed us by the way. She gave her best kudos to Rafael and Sammy, with Sammy from the Dominican Republic by the way. That nothing happened to him, but nevertheless, because she didn't want to get to two cozy with Jose, there even as she went to school a block away and he never stole her freight train. Although, quite frankly, last time I checked he was Cuban, last time I checked Jose. And that's why she was trying to do the old cover up there. Okay, I dropped my shoulders. How about Wolfgang Amideus Mozart? Was he a celebrity? He was the Kurt Cobain of his time. He drank a lot and party and he died at 8.35 and was thrown into a popper's grave. Well, we'll be for him. Okay, we'll see somebody in the movie. Okay, that's fine, but he doesn't qualify for a pull. He's not a celebrity. Not now. Not among our slime ball crowd. Jim says there's a guy who died earlier this year without whom he may never have had. But third man. Olderdy bastard deserves a place on a pull. Olderdy, that's right. Remember what he died? Yeah. I'm going to have to play that bit with Regis. It's an olderdy. But third man? It's a thirty. Olderdy. Kind of like olderdy, you know? Let's see. How about Regis? Yeah. There's another one for you. So many. Somebody see the point I'm trying to make here and it's pretty obvious. Anybody. All of these people. Jim Morrison. You have to send me that like he's not on a pull. Do we need him off the pull? Uh, you need to check. We let's give Morrison off the pull. That's my bad. I would not. You're right. We didn't leave him off the pull. What a jerk I am. That was the first one. I'm in there. Huh? Nice research. Yeah. Up yours. Go back to Cuba. Go back with your team. You and I. You and I. Go back to Havana. I could see where Fidel was through your ass. Anyway, Jerry Garcia says. Oh, not Jerry Garcia. He never do drugs. Uh, and Jim Morrison. Make sure I apologize and thank God he fact that he has been in the whole pull. And I had Jim Morrison on there all the fight. Frankly, he's still alive. That's another one. Kurt Cobain and Jim Morrison all these cults. And of course Elvis, that goes without saying they're all still alive. They're probably having a big party right now. They're probably doing rights from probably injecting each other right now. You think? I tell you I was got fat. You stopped. Hey Elvis, you're fairie. So that's the deal with all these hearings and all this other ballooning. The reason for the pull is because like I said, there's 80's in people who are admired by young people. Emulated by young people, rock stars, movie stars, all of these people. Big name celebrities, TV celebrities, drunk, drugs, slime of the earth and yet. We're not having any. Thank goodness. Any congressional hearings about that. And shouldn't. And we shouldn't. That's not what we pay the years just to be doing with our tax money. It shouldn't be having the baseball hearing either. That's that's what I just said. That's that's my point. That's my point. Another one. Catching on to my point. No, I got you there. And what did I say yesterday? These hearings are absolutely unacceptable. Unnecessary and unacceptable. It's crap. Just again, goody two shoes, pandering, which is why several of these people just made their flowered little speeches. And I was kind of concerned like that one black, a democrat. I don't know what her name was as simple to me. I was kind of concerned. I don't know if you're going to answer or not. If anybody has anything to say, but I was kind of concerned. I mean, this is the kind of stuff like like you'd see on what's that show at a broad sit around. It's stupid I showed at verbal water show. The view. The view. Yeah, that's a kind of crap. I was kind of wondering, you know, if you're really as fat as you look, honey. Wow. And you know something to say, part of it is that America is so brainwashed that they believe this. They really believe this crap. Just like they were showing on CNN this morning. It was showing the tape of them pulling the statue down, which was not nothing more than a photo opportunity for CNN. It was all done with a bunch of henchmen. And they're going on about that in the hole in the ground. You know, where they found a sedan, which we now know is a bunch of crap. The media is not only sick, but the media marmus all these people belong on death roads. Sure, this isn't a million Roger. The ones who tell the R156, the FU, the AM. This is the Neil Roger show. What the fuck? This is your brain. You failed. Any questions? All the world loves a cloud. So this April Fool's Day, this radio pageant is going to make a fool with other views. That's right. We're going to turn you into a laughing star. Just be the 10th of color. We do hear this star. And we'll get your pants down around your ankles. Tie your hands behind your head. Hey, this is my leafage on your butt cheeks. And lock you out of your head. You'll be the shutter of a tensioning no time. Remember, they're not laughing at you. They're laughing with you. With you and your butt cheeks. Employees of this radio station are not eligible to be made fools of since they've already done quite a good job making fools of themselves every day on the air. Employees are never the last wish to drop a pants in public or encourage to do so after leaving the station. Oh, even a fool. People are saying for your chance to win. Love it all till at 5.60. Every QM happy Friday too. I mean, you know, that one of Congress, Minimum One Guy from Massachusetts, I guess, was reading that little ass-in thing from Ozeys book. But I'd like to know how come they didn't read the paragraphs that I just got through. We're in a special day at last one. We're only really getting started on the National Conversation. What I'm hoping for is that some forward-looking voices will come out an urge baseball to embrace the potential of steroids and fight for their place in the game and in our lives. Huh? See, this is what Congress does. There are a bunch of millimouth, whosys man that they overwhelmingly majority them who just sit there. It's like they're in awe to be in the presence of the superjocks. And especially the God squad representative Kurt Schilling, the anxious Kurt Schilling, with all that every other word was either God or the Republicans, which of course nowadays it's the same crap. Man, I especially like to part where Sammy had to have his lawyer read his opening statement because Sammy no speaking English too well. But that didn't bother really Anna, man. Rosanna Dana. How can you people have any conscience and find that somebody like that bitch is a represents part of South Florida in Congress? How is that possible, huh? It is absolutely... Are they acceptable? Anyway, don't get your South college started. Okay. 560560 and a Verizon and Singular Wartel Slime. Maybe some of the people who watched that, maybe they have some thoughts or maybe not. Or maybe they got some more dead people for our pool. Dead drug use, huh? Perhaps. Perhaps. Or maybe not. Or maybe they just don't give a flying leap. WDQAM. Hello. Hi, this is Caches and Hollywood. Yes, sir? Yeah, I want to talk to Neil. You're talking to him. What do you think about the lava flake itself? And they can wreck little pimp. That was the best call of the year. Alright, it's only the middle of March, but that was the winner. We're going to send you a $0.00 in play money. That was good. Yeah. And Paula Andrew, she may be getting in big trouble too, by the way. That always stories. But I want to read him right now because McElghet really been on a shape. 560, pound 560 on a Verizon and Singular Wireless Line. Don't forget that attorney for the Bacley family since he's going to let that smile off or let his push. That's what he said. WQAM. Hello. Yeah, hey Neil. Yes, sir? It's pretty amazing that they want to protect young high cool kids. Yeah. Because they're dropped age. Yeah, that's right. Keep them alive. We need them. The molasses can check them over there to be blown up. For our fodder, for our fodder. Yeah, for the oil that we're not getting. Potter for the mill, right. Yeah. Okay. Big enough easy. And by the way, don't forget. I want you to say it. Thank you, Mr. President, for these little gas prices. Absolutely. Thank you, Mr. President, for the little gas prices. The iron and California and then the wind. In California, that's right. We could be over there. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Okay. See you at the pumps. 560, 560, pound 560 on a Verizon and Singular Wireless Line. This is what you wanted America. This is what you got sucked into a baby. You're paying a wicked, wicked price. There's people dying, a wicked that every day. And the house of representatives is holding hearings talking to a bunch of illiterate jocks about crap. Should we put an asterisk next to the record and Mr. Sealing? Are you really as dumb as you appear? And the only thing we have to fear is Donald Fierre. Get out and hear what is crap. By the way, they have some more NHL meetings just. They have nothing. No, the Hitties said they're like poison even worse. But yeah, the NHL and they reduced the salary cap. They reduced it from 42 out of 37 million. So as far apart as they were before, just forget about it. That's all. That's my best suggestion. Just forget about it. Just send some more money to Alan Cohen so we can buy a much more race horses. He likes it. W2A and hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I don't know if you've got spaces on this, but all the Jews in more Howard. They were yesterday. Yes. The United FBI, the Asian 13 years ago, both, majorly paid for that. I had a steroid problem. Yeah. It wasn't president Bush part of the Texas Rangers ownership group in that time. He owned it. Yes. He should be sitting before Congress. Yeah. Well, hold your left, Ali. I'll call you up as soon as though that hearing takes place. That was one of the things they pointed to keep trying to say is that the owners do about it in the managers and every people all over the place the trainers and court curse. Shilling you all. I don't know. Nobody knew nothing. I didn't hear about these things. He's too busy reading his Bible. Kurt, you don't have time for that crap. For this garbage. Now, an hour and fifty three minutes from now, for weren't for all his right wing hysteria about Terry Chavoy when his grand standing. There's in their sticking the federal government into state of Florida's affairs. If it weren't for that, she'd be having that tube removed. It would take some time for her to die and finally have some release and relief. But that ain't going to happen now, because the right wingers are going to show you just how much they care about life. Or maybe they're just trying to, remember when the first president Bush said he didn't like to broccoli. Remember that? Yep. This Republican group is trying to say, well, we've changed their mind like Jose. We like vegetables. After all, we love him. WKOM. WKOM. Hello. Yes, sir. I think that the Congress needs to start doing something a little bit more productive. How many freaking people get killed by alcohol? Forget our forgets the roses. How many people getting to a car crash and just kill like 20 other fucking kids? Yeah, right. Exactly. A little bit too much emphasis on the kids, but nevertheless, a little bit. Just a little bit over the top, but I appreciate his emotion. Five, six, seven. Look at the emotion of this crowd. Man, are they whipped up to a frenzy about this or what? No, no. And I didn't expect so. And you see the Indiana Roseanna Danifing. I want you to explain to me. I guarantee there are people listening right now. Why you would vote for this insane person for this ultimate Pandor. She is the ultimate. I mean, odd people in politics, Pandor. But she makes the others pale in a win significance. A one-note Johnny. Like I said, hey, if it could be talking about what kind of homintosh now you're going to eat on Forrom and somehow she would tie that in to a Fidel and Cuba. She could tie anything into that crap. They could be talking about drilling in Alaska for oil and she would tie that into Castro and Cuba. That's all she knows. Indiana Roseanna Danif. She is my least favorite person on the face of the earth. Come even, dubbio. I like compared to her. Wow. Even Anne Kofer, I like compared to her. She is the anti-Christ Roseanna Danif. How do you rid of her? She is the- let me say again. She's everything that is wrong in Dave County. Racked up into one piece of pus. That's her. Cuba to Cuba. I am hello. Nice call. I was her. Cuba to Cuba. Yeah, I'm here. I'm talking about stupid things that our government is doing. Yeah. I'm a, I adopt an hour. Take care of gray hounds and the interesting article same. Do you have to? Kansas State Legislature. This is a state where they raise a lot of our gray hounds for racing. Uh-huh. As pass the bill saying, gray hounds are not considered to God. Because they are not raised as death. And do not. And are not pondered the regulations that are ready. Well, that's okay. There's one aspect in Kansas. There's still no one in their creation is in thing. There are a bunch of any other souls. Now I'll put them one. But I thought you might find that error. No. Okay. Thanks. Five six seven or five. Not even remotely. But he saw it on my. Dominic, you are. Hello. Hey, Nate, I'll go. Pretty good. Palli. What's up? It did a great job. Tax dollars are hard work. All the problem the United States has. We're talking about these dumb shots. I say let them stick to needles up the rest. Oh. Thanks. Ha ha ha. All right. Excellent job. Hey, he was fired up. There you go. And pissed off. Five six seven or five six. At least we got somebody down. We're a little bit of emotion. And that otherwise it's that heat man. And he did a humidity. I don't know what it's actually a nice day today. We'll wait tonight after all a rain. My gut from what I'm hearing it's a mirror. You haven't floated away. It's almost like a tsunami. That next week. No, it hasn't been raining like nonstop for a couple days until today. Yesterday all day. Now see, that was a bonus for me because on TSN here, which carries a lot of ESP and programming that we're carrying the hearings. And they were going to like cut away to four o'clock to the golf that Arnold Palmer golf crapping Orlando. And there was Arne. They showed them what is. They showed up to his knees and a wading around and all the water on the greens. I mean, get a life already. When you're pleased Mr. Palmer and Mr. Nicholas, all of a sudden pick on him at your granted drown. But even so, it's just that we be angers me too. People who just fritter away their whole lives and cock a ride like that, like golf. What did you do with your life? All I was into golf. Yeah. Somebody to QAM. Hello. Dr. Philip. You're on the baseball. What did you do? What did you do? I'm a man. Hello. Neil, it is so amazing that our government made so much money and time trying to face a vegetable. I don't get it. Yeah. First, I'm going about steroids and baseball. And now they're going about saving vegetables. There, there, there, there, there, there, the youth article in, well, within yesterday's Sun's Denal.

And our history and our traditions say that. Court's don't tell presidents. how to conduct war, Congress, whether or not to raise taxes, and the legislature doesn't decide the life and death issues, the human rights inside of an individual court case. There you go. Nice going, Candle. You finally said something good. You seem to be a ruggish, but less than any of the practices that you're doing. She may end. Yeah. Fettam and Fatiess.

Somebody finally responded to my pleading. He's my screeching. He's about this crazy as bitch. She's a congresswoman. I like my little dog was a congressman. I think Tiny would have probably said something I made more sense. All he was too blind for Dale and the raffy wouldn't play. She makes a speech. This isn't a place for grandstanding and species about Cuba. It's a terrible thing. Hearing. What? At him or her? And the camera's a role and that's right.

As a deadline, looms US Senate Republicans sought to keep severely brain damage Terry Shival alive today with an invitation to bring her to Washington and an attorney for her parents and they hope to move with them more time. They're supposed to move to two men, one PM. Oh, we're going to be here right in the middle of this. So in the exciting. Very. The Senate Health Committee is requested that Terry Shival and her husband Michael appeared in official committee hearing on March 28th earlier today. A house committee was issuing congressional subpoenas to stop doctors from disconnecting the tube. Michael Shival is wedged a year long bat. The years long battle with his parents in law, containing his wife was been an a persistent vegetative state Florida since 1990. We would not want to let it away since 1990. Fifteen longer excruciating years and they will literally die. Courts have cleared away for him to remove her feeding tube as early as one PM today. The tube has removed been removed twice in the past and then reinserted as the battle continued. I think that Tom Delay ought to take that to put it right in his window. That's it. It is a contemptive Congress to prevent a discord someone from following his opinion as finished. David gives an attorney for a parent said, that's what the US Congress is saying. We want to see Terry Shival. We want to hear her testimony. Mmm. Or dislike that. Would that be great? In fact, we wouldn't get her in hell and color. She won your hide in the miracle worker. Despite her handicaps, she left behind a lifetime of achievements. And now with a discovery of rare audio tapes found in a basement somewhere in New Jersey. Death Jam Records makes available to you.

Saying they were forever grateful. Isn't this heart-wending? Whatever that means? The man charged yesterday with hatching the scheme, Kelly A. Frank. Worked as a painter with the talk show host 2700 acres spread near the rugged Rocky Mountain front. The 43-year old Frank equated a police had planned to hold a boy in his nanny for $5 million ransom. Lot of slime ball. Kelly A. Frank. I wonder if he's kind of del Frank.

We will forever be grateful for their countless efforts and determination to vigorously pursue this situation. The couple said in a statement. They also said.

The host of CBS's late show taped three programs earlier this week, but the never coverage of the main college basketball tournament, preempted as seriously in Friday shows.

It's just no matter what you want to watch, it's just not on her because they got like West Wichita State is playing Voisey State the girl's school for the blind and I'll come on already. Okay, it's all very important. Oh, that's our forgot about that. Neverland Housekeeper says kids drank and slept with Jackson drank. Lot of that Jesus Jews getting spread around. Michael Jackson's former housekeeper described Neverland ranch yesterday as a place where children became wild during long stays with it without their parents. Grink booze in Jackson's presence. And often slept with a puff star. You're fairer instead of in their assigned guest rooms. But under cross examination the woman testified she never saw Jackson's serve alcohol to monitors. Additionally, she said she believed the accuser and his brother were staying in guest rooms, not Jackson's room during the time the voice as he was molested. Testifying in Jackson's Chapel Station trial, Kiki Fornier said Jackson would focus as attention on particular children. All of them were boys between 10 and 15. She said the string of boys included movie star McColle Colkan, the accuser in the current case and his younger brother. A boy who scammedly reached that multimillion dollar set of mode Jackson 93 after alleging molestation and Frank Tyson. Jackson associate now in his early 20s was the name of his unindicted co-conspirator in the current case. The end of the go down and says that. But a four year old 40, he worked at the Jackson number by 12 years before leaving in September 2003. Also yesterday, one of the investigators who serves neverland sergeant con able of the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department testify that he found books with nude and semi nude photos of adolescents in the restaurant Jackson's office. And the office also contains surveillance equipment that could be used to monitor phone calls. I love her under defense crosses and emanation. He could, he said he could not say for sure whether it ever been you who didn't know what to do the equipment it could be what legally. Also considered the could of a news is part of the security system at the ranch. And a part of it in a pair of three. Now comes the most important part. The biggest story that they forget about those steroid hearings. Forget about Terry Shilow and at Veggie's native state. Little Kim faces jail. Oh my god. Right isn't that the most important story that they had. That's right. Like that guy called all been out of shape about how veredogates off a little Kim made we go to jail. And quite frankly, after those pictures we had on there was yesterday, Josh. No, it was a little ago. Yeah, two days ago. Oh, brother, she belongs on death row after that. Now, if I George does for putting that on there. The she is nasty. How are you? Wow, you're going to. Huh? That's why you're about here. No, and George is suspended for put little Kim on it. Yeah, let's do it again like they used to on the first day in George's and rehab. Or George got so many votes on the police today about you hate him that he's not here today. He's home looking his wounds. He needed that break. Right. He's not even here to hear the story on the swapping on swinging. Why swapping? We'll get to that. Rapper, little Kim, as expected, he sends to jail time after being convicted of surgery if they didn't in New York. Oh, no. How can this be? The pint size performer who won a Grammy in 2001, not for her performance alongside Pink, Maya and Kristina Agalera on the song Lady Marmalade. And if I ever see that video again, I will absolutely bust my TV screen. Don't you hate that? Yeah, it's pretty weak. Oh, and when I was in Amsterdam, that's when that was out.

Anyway, she was being tried for obstructing the course of justice conspiracy and can adpurture and making false statements. The charges stand for more connection with a shootout between her entourage and associates of a rival hip-hop artist outside New York Wader Station, not 97 in 2001. Oh, it's those East Coast rappers, no West Coast rappers again. Oh, man. Prosecutors alleged that the singer lied to them during their investigation during grand jury testimony. How what about old dirty would think about this, you know? Yesterday, the singer beat the obstructed justice charge, but was found guilty on three constant, personally, one conspiracy charge. The singer told Prosecutors he was wearing dark glasses and therefore did not see her, so she was looking in Butler and Suith Jackson, take place in the shootout. But several witnesses placed the two at the scene with her. Though she left the court silent, maybe 29-year-old rapper later released the statement saying the verdict left her disappointed. The rapper will return to court June 24 for a sentence, saying she paces up to five years behind bars for each count. How you like that? The red of Bobby Blake, he walks free and poor little Tim.

Now my heart stops. You should sometimes find out for my intestines. I guess I should have known what to expect, because in my arms, with the kind of service you can understand, I would ask to be too far away. Here's my favorite piece that I follow.

Back in the day, when he first called in there, and this coming at a time when I was discussing pedagiri's fish food. And the discuss dulce de la Chine, the same time that I'm talking pedagiri's fish food. And the same breath is like it's blasphemy. It's like talking George W.

And then when you say to them, don't get involved in sex unless it's marriage or love. It's dangerous out there and yet the teachers and directors are helping them go through those kind of jarrations. And he's getting all worked up about it evidently. Under Redwood's Bill of a School District knowingly permit sex or performance, France from the state would be reduced and amount to be determined by the education commissioner. I guess by the same number of dollars, an extumber dollar is free to shake, right? Yeah. For every bumping grind. Edward said he filed a bill as resolved a several instance and the same such rival performances in his district. J.M.

But I do think there's a lot of talking about it. No, I'm only kidding, but I do think there is a lot of c behind some of that. And I don't know. Don't think about it. It'll clean up the sport, even though I don't think steroids. Oh, are you listening to this show? Yes, sir. He says what I'm hoping is that some more intelligent forward-looking voices will come out in urge baseball to embrace the potential of steroids to fight for their place in the game and in our lives. Any other question? No, I agree with that. I agree with that. But as far as you agree with her, you agree with her. You agree with her. What? That the people in baseball ought to come up for steroids? Well, no, but that the truth should be known. Did you hear anything that I just got to have you voted for a alienarost latent? Never.

Anyway, your all-time favorite celebrity who died from drugs and or booze, and we are not going to have any congressional hearings about this. And the reason I'm doing the pull again today if you two did like this, because these baseball hearings yesterday, one of the most embarrassing episodes in the history of the United States Congress of Worcester or so many, and now we got the Terry Shival thing that they, it's just never ends. In important business, they just can't seem to get done. To take care of really important issues. To take care of people. Can't do it. But they're going to protect all these kids from a steroids.

Where did they find these guys on? He sounded a little like that to St. Patrick. Right, a little dig-by-tell on heavy green booze. I don't know, but go for it. Is that the only game that's on? No, there's got to be some other game because that's in a cool life spot right now. I've got a bunch of games going on, but the only game in our sports station we get one game. So that's it. That's right. I got games up to the old Yingying here, man. Well, you got all the games all over the place. I got a Gulfstream and Acquita Gracing going on.

I just, uh, yesterday I saw that Ely and Iraq lately is in flying for the chairperson on the, uh, house in a national relations committee. Oh, my God. And I've got to the website and she's in charge of, guess what? The Middle Eastern International Relay. I made so lot of sense to me. Now, when was Cuba in the Middle East? Did they buy it? I don't know. I don't know. But the only thing is, is now we can answer what's the problem in the Middle East. Do you get her offsite? It's her. If you ask what the problem is with anything, it's her. If you have bad diarrhea, man, she caused it. But yesterday was their day. It was same Patrick's day to grantees. I think you know what I'm saying? That's right. I forgot that. Okay, Pally. But. Good luck to us. Ely and I rose in to Dana, baby. You know, nobody wants to touch her with a ten foot pull after that performance yesterday. You're just killing Cuba. Cuba. Fidget. Five minutes of rambling on would like her. Like an auto biography. And how much she loves raffy and Sammy and Jose, you better go down there and talk to them kids at Coral Park High. And I went to school up to street. And everybody hates me like poison. And I'm a bubble head and Gilder Wagner's rolling over in her grave. You're listening to the new world that we see that was by with a death on five and so does Dan. Come to Pena and a republic, baby. Oh, we're Miami. I'm proud of that. I'm proud of that. I'm proud of that. I'm late, but then I'm here to stay. I saw me on my his side. Sound the name of the year in the office for life and oh, it's all too. Of the foolishness that you inside. That's true. You're a fom a tiny little liner. That's made in 20 to why you're lying. You know what else? Why you're lying in. Outside the day, it's not the line. I'm still been as confused as you'd be for me to be as bad as you'd be. But for most of your new days for the media, the camera. And the professional TV power, and I find it's me like on your savior. What are your meaning with causes? I've got a hammer to be at your heart. You're fair. From 47 to 5, 16 of you come in. It's very timely that you send me this note here about Joe Costello being in town and says hi, is he there? No, he's not here. Oh, well, who sent this? I did. Well, he thought like here in person. Oh, I see. Hi, Joe. The reason I say that is because Joe, this is auto racing show on XM. Right. And at one point, we discussed he brought it up. He said, I'm not sure if he's going to be in. Well, you know, XM needs some programming. I'll be out of it. But it looks like right now because I just got an email from a certain normal. It looks like we're going to get serious maybe. Good. Two and I'm saying. Yeah. Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on. Go on. You know, Josh, you need to do somebody. You've been hanging around with Dave and boring to her on, you know. That's that. That's that.

Wash it off and the soap tool and you'll just be fine as wine. Oh, speak in a bed. Wait, wait. See, this is America for you. We got 12 minutes until we've removed the tube or not. It will be right on top of that, baby. We'll be all over it like stink on Maddie Bell. Guess who's getting wedding proposals? Scott Peterson. Of course. On Scott Peterson's first day on death row, two women called Santa California San Quentin State Prison to say they were interested in mirroring him. Police folksman, Vernelli Quentin, didn't say about 3,000 women called San Quentin with messages as a support for the prison's newest bachelor convicted and sentenced to die for the murder of his pregnant wife, Lacey. Two of them actually indicated to our staff their purpose for calling was marriage. Yet it's not unusual for a night's to get married while on death row. Peterson wearing orange prison scrubs and shackles arrived at the notorious prison about 4am. But he took him to the police station and he was wearing a bulletproof vest because of security concerns. It was removed once inside the compound. Critten and said that his Peterson was placed into his 41 square foot cell. He sat on his bucket and stared at the wall. Scott, I guess you want to lay down, pick a nap now. And obviously he said he responded, man, I'm just too jazzed. He even think about sleeping. He's jazzed. And with that, the cells mumbled or locked shut and the prison staff walked away. Well, my God. And I was in the bed. One of the guards turned around and yelled, you're fairy. That was it. I mean like that. Two of them ever proposed a lot of, in the first hour that he's in the slamer. And you think there are a lot of really sick people and you wonder why Bonnie Lee basically got her. You wonder why? She had to come in. How could anybody say? It's one of the few things I agree with George wholeheartedly on the bitch had to come in. And he knows about, you know, that kind of thing. Does he? That's right here. WDQ. I am hello. Hey, I need a good afternoon. So that's an order. Let's start. We've been with you. A seven o'clock today. Iliana Roslett and Nicole, the three Q1 so-called Q and a station. Oh, my God. Okay, to give a report of what happened. Like, I mean, she worked for free. You know, a D3 station have two reporters in Washington. They laid on the as ballad on her. And she, she said this. And I'm quoting almost. The most important part of what happened yesterday is when Prof. Lito, Rafaelito, me and Palmeiro said that he will not play in Cuba, where Castro is there. He does need those cars. Okay, that's what was the most important scene of the whole. Oh, yeah. That was the whole. Isn't that what all hearing was about just to make sure to get a few shots in fell in there? Um, I think that's what it was all about. Oh, my God. I can see the tender or anything like that. But that three three stations between seven and seven, that is this morning. Kedios Amigus, we've done so. And the notice there's now one person in this town who will call an issue and admit they've ever voted for her. Oh, my God. Change in my district by the way. Yeah. And you never voted for me. I will vote for King Kong. If if you're on against her, if he is embarrassing, he is ashamed. And he's one issue person. Nothing else. She hasn't done anything for that. Three in 12 years that she's been in Congress. Uh, by the way, have you watched Bob Sheef or in CBS? I'm all done with him. But he watched him two nights and when he said, Oh, he's going to. Oh, my God. That was the end. That was the end. Thank you very much. Okay. Okay. Okay. No, never watched CBS. There was a Bob Sheef or the anti-cross man. We are thinking the same. Okay. There's a little too. Hope he and I sit him to Oki Finoffy to the swamp. Oki, Oki, Oki. I still let go of me go and don't forget. Oki, Oki, Oki. Oki, Oki, Oki. See it. Oki, Oki, Oki. Rubber, Ducky. Bob Sheef or my ass. Bob, I'm telling you, you know CBS has got the CBS, I is crying like Allison Wonderland and it's just pouring not for tears. They're going to drown the sea of their own tears. You're like this, do I? For buffalo. There's not too much to like about buffalo. I guarantee that. They've ever been in buffalo? Never. Josh? No, no, no, no. Don't do it. I won't. I'll toilet. I know you're talking about. What do you mean you're on talking about? The T.P. The what? Oh, and then we'll just see that story. Ah, I have faith in the air. Read them on our website. No, actually. The buffalo area is county budget crisis is taking a toll on the bathrooms at least one public building in buffalo. Eury County has had to slice 2,000 jobs and cut back on services in order to close more than a hundred million dollars budget shortfall. In the wrath building in downtown Buffalo, workers report that the bathrooms aren't being cleaned or maintained. One long time worker the building tells buffalo's WGRZ TV that there's no soap, no paper towels or toilet paper in the restrooms. Speak at the WGRZ. How's that the CBS affiliate I wonder? Let me take a look. No, that's WVIVB. There's WGRZ right now. They got family feud. How much money the profession given church each week? You said. $50. $50. But third man. What a great church. No. Survey said. Not too good. Anyway, that's WGRZ. You know how to do that. How could anybody also do that? Just pop or write on your. Pop or write on there. The wrath building is helping many county offices, including the county executive Joel Gianbra, the Department of Social Services and Health Department. Here's the upshot of this story which I nearly got sidetracked because of you. It's so bad. Some county employees are bringing in their own toilet paper. Another supplies. The workers told WGRZ. It's like working in another country. A bad country. And that is buffalo. I arrest my case. Oh, what I'll do with how is he. So fat boy. What a great man. That is this. That's buffalo. A toilet. 560560 pound. 560 leave a rise in singular wireless line. WQA and hello. Pretty good. I had a little radio access other day when you're doing the hall of painful.

What are I telling you? I've tweeted that a million times. The chronics, they don't have any loyalty. Anybody that will put them on and feed their egos and then try to give them some semblance of a life. They'll go anywhere that somebody will listen to them and put them on for five seconds or more. It's tragic and it's enclosing. Whoah. Okay. Good choice. In fact, I'm not sure which, and then I'm being the poll one day. What's the best line by Al Pacino either? Tuma. Right. Or. You're fairie. You're a little runger. I'm five, sixty. And. Yeah. There goes the audio, though. That was that. Yeah, that was that. I was having problems all day. Oh, no. And just died. It was half a last spot in the break. Yes, it was. I'll be there. Well, and it's maybe a good thing that it died because the Terry Shiveos tube will not be removed. Oh. Penalis County judge should a restraining order and they will not be removing the tube. As we speak. I like them. So I can't just a chance to like brace him a hot news. Oh, boy. It's the one to two hours. A long long time ago. It was 1900. And Jesse Helms was just a lad of nine. And no one knew what was in store. Just ended the Spanish American War. So they poured it like it was 1890. 99. It were events that made you shiver. But there were times we did the libel. A promise that was kept. With that famous one small step. I can't remember each event or everything that man did in the end. A century we were present. This is how it went. My, my, how the time it did, by sense. It started some deported man. It's he's we did try. For the century it's done that we say goodbye. It all happened in the blink of an eye. A hundred years have gone by. It all started when two guys were right.

Hopefully it works. It's looking good at the moment. Do I want to try that? No, that's not doing it. I don't want to. Here's the Terry Shival deal. The forgiving of a very pain. I need the beyond Holly, I'll come back. There's time to lay in a bunch of mugwamps. Okay. A state judge today temporarily blocked a removal of the feeding tube that keeps severely brain damage Terry Shival while I was legal wrangling continued over reference by Congressional Republicans that were testifying Washington. She's going to go up there and say, Yeah, it could be a lot better than testable they've heard on the roads yesterday. You're going to hear that. Whatever she has to say or make a sound, it's going to be a lot more useful and meaningful than whatever we're saying yesterday. For now, let's, for now, a circuit court judge David Deemers ordered that the feeding tube remained in place past the 1pm dead. Longer, which of course it already is now. While fellow judge George Greer, who's presiding over the Shival case, deals with conflicting legal issues. The Senate health committee's requested that Terry Shival and her husband Michael, and period of the official committee, her remarks 28. Earlier today, a house committee was issuing congressional subpoenas to stop doctors from disconnecting the feeding tube that keeps her alive. Don't you see our fat ass governor's spine hand in the middle of all of this? Yep. The hospice where Terry Shival lives received a subpoena late this morning. Spokesman and woman Louise Clarries said officials did not disclose the next steps. At this time, we are monitoring developments and consulting with legal ethical advisors to determine what to do, she said, and she said, maybe hearing to be held March 25th at the hospice. Here on Capitol Hill on the Senate side, meanwhile, an invitation for Terry Shival and her husband to appear. I just got to say now, okay, I'd rather hear the occulting tubes. Please, for free. For free, for free. For free, for free. I'd like to continue doing great. I'm pretty glad to go to Shival. I'm really, really, really, really. I'm really, really, really.

We want to gators. We love the gators. What's the floor? We've got a roof for the floor to tames. Okay, now, what do we want to do? We want to do like a longer break. We want to see if this is going to work. We want to talk that last spot, you know, and long ago. I think it's important. I stuffed that last spot that was cut off in this part. When I sure make sure they're very long break. And especially on a heels of an eight minute bit, which is the longest one we have in there, I do believe. I mean, that's almost like blasphemy. I think we want the second hit is the stickiness. When you're paying Josh Curtis to kind of mind it, they're paying him. They're not doing it to like, you know, these kind of lives. Stended copouts. But I didn't, it's very, very pretty long to it. Not even close. The one that we can't play anymore, of course. Of course, that's just about any of them. It's like 95%. That's 425, man. This bit is eight, something. Eight minutes and 19 second. How do you like that? I like it. A lot. That's good. That's good.

On the head ABC showed desperate housewives speaking to the generals. She didn't destroy his marriages because Fauss' line knew it. But we found couples who say they found a way to enjoy the company. Without the disceptions as ABC News, it's called the lifestyle or swinging. And a raisement where couples have sex with other couples and there's no secrecy. Brian and old good Deppenbroke got married four years ago. Now they run a business together and after work they like to go to a club for a lot of day. They'll call trap peas. It's like other night clubs of the dance floor, but Faien Bar. But it's not like other clubs because in the back there's a locker room where couples can get on dress and if they want have sex and different bedrooms with other couples or watch each other in hot tub. It's called swing or the lifestyle. The way they write this, like this is some kind of a revelation like a new and exciting. Yeah, like who's ever heard of it before? Right. Isn't it immoral? It says four couples I talked with said, no, it's a good thing. What we do is not illegal. I don't believe it's a moral Brian Deppenbroke said. Chris who participates in lifestyle with his wife Levant said, I don't want to be 85 years old looking back on my life like man, I didn't have enough sex in my life. Another swing and couple Bob and Tess, or colours sweet horse. Most of the couples we talked to didn't want their lives names used. They've been married 18 years and five years into the marriage decided to try the lifestyle. Tess was the first woman I ever kissed in my whole life so you have to have an innate curiosity how would another woman feel? I no longer have that curiosity Bob said. Swinging was Tess's idea. She heard about her from a girlfriend and was intrigued. She figured that relationship was strong enough to give a swinging a try. You have to be completely open and honest with each other. She said, well if they look back at their lives and feel they ruined the intimacy they had with each other by having sex with all these other people we don't have. So here we carry now. Let's get into the most important story of the day and of the week into the century. Cuban president Fidel Castro has criticized Forbes magazine for the infamy of listing him among the world's richest people with the net worth a 550 million bucks. Trumpching. Once again they have committed the infamy of speaking about Castro's portion placing me almost above the queen of England. He said in the speech of the top officials of Cuba's ruling communist party military and police. They come on Eastos. Do they think I'm former Zayrian president Mabu to or one of those many millionaires? Those thieves and plunders that the empire has suckled and protected he said and referenced to his capitalist our enemy the US. What they should be doing is looking for the money of all those people he said. Castro's 17 in power since 59. City was considered suing. To second straight year he's appeared on the Forbes list last year the magazine put his worth at 150 million. So that means he made 400 million last year even I didn't do that. That's pretty good you're close. On Tuesday Forbes published a story on the fortunes of the world's richest rulers and has a state of cloning Castro Britain's queen Elizabeth. You're fairery. And the Sultan of Brunei say number examples of capitalism did not qualify for the world's billionaires list. The weekly financial magazines said that bad when these territories can be tricky. And the fact we've had to rely on a percentage of Cuba's gross domestic product to us to make fiddle sports. They said this year we use more traditional valuation methods comparing state-owned assets cashers assumed to control what's comparable public trade companies and a cartridge in fair tree and nobody cares about that either. I'd say they want to know definitely do not care about and that's the roi. Don't let me forget I'm Monday even though we got the weekend come up Monday to rip Hank and ask when we have our crossover. He's the one to come in and watch an at crappiest. If I wouldn't have done that I wouldn't have opened up the Jose book again. I wouldn't have talked about it and believe you me.

Greg Tolas to rise for BBC News writes and I'm going to read this and spend a minute. Maybe you won't be there Monday through Thursday because I'll read too much. Sorry. Greg Tolas writes the Bush administration made plans for war and for a rest oil before the 9.11 attacks sparking a policy battle between New yokeans and big oil. BBC News night has revealed. Two years ago today, when President Bush announced US British and allied forces would begin to bomb Baghdad, protesters claimed the US had a secret plan for Iraq's oil. One side of them had been conquered. In fact, there were two conflicting plans, sending off a hidden policy where between New yokeans servitors at the Pentagon on one side versus a combination of big oil executives and US State Department pragmatists. Big oil appears to have won. The latest plan obtained by News Night from the US State Department was we learned, drafted with the help of American oil and district consultants. Inside is told news night that tiny began within weeks of Bush's first taking office in 2001, long before the 9.11 attacks on the US. An Iraqi-born oil industry consultant Fala Algebrai said he took part in the secret meetings of California, Washington and the Middle East. He described the State Department timeframe for a forced coup to ta. Mr. Algebrai himself told News Night that the interviewed potential successors to saw him who's saying on behalf of the Bush administration. The industry-favored plan was pushed aside by a secret plan, drafted just before the invasion in 2003, which called for the sell-off of all of Ermass oil fields. The new plan was crafted by Neocons and sent on using Iraq's oil to destroy the OPEC cartels through massive increases in production above OPEC quotas. The sell-off was given the green light and the secret meeting in London headed by Auschwemitz, Charlie Anthony West entered Baghdad, according to Robert Evel. Mr. Evel of former energy and CIA oil analyst now fellow of the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington told News Night he flew to the London meeting at the request of the State Department. Mr. Algebrai once Robert Reagan's back channel to the bottom claims that the plans to sell off Iraq's oil pushed by the U.S. installed governing council in 2003 helped instigate the insurgency in the tax on U.S. and British occupying forces. Insurgency used that is saying, look, you're losing your country, you're losing resources to a bunch of wealthy beginners who want to take you over and make your life miserable said Mr. Algebrai from his home to San Francisco. We saw an increase in the bombing of oil facilities, pipelines built on the premise that privatization is coming. Philip Carroll the former CEO of Shell oil U.S.A. who took control of Iraq's oil efforts in the West government, and, at the end, the U.S. took control of the oil facilities in the West government. He made it clear to Paul Bremer, the U.S. occupations chief arrived in Iraq May 2003 that there was to be no privatization of Iraqi oil resources or facilities while I was involved. Area of Cohen of the Neocon Heritage Foundation. Oye! Told News Night that an opportunity had been Mr. privatized of oil fields. He advocated that the plan is to means to help the U.S. defeat OPEC and he said America should have gone ahead with what he called a no-brainer decision. Mr. Carroll hit back telling News Night, I would agree with that statement. The privatized would be a no-brainer. It would only be thought about by somebody with no brain. New plans obtained by the state of the state of the state of the United Harper's Magazine of the U.S. Freedom Federation Act. Call for a creation of a state-owned oil company favored by the U.S. oil industry. It was completed in January 2004 under the guidance of Amy Jaffey of the James Baker Institute in Texas.

And that would be the end of the legal process. And she could live on. And this would go away. For many more years. Michael Shivow would for better or worse.

As I've reached in for the last page of three fantastic stories here right at the SN of the show, tremendous. According to reports, Stereophonics frontman Kelly Jones was stopped from boarding a hair airplane at Lottens Heathrow Airport. After the design on his teacher caused an unexpected security alert. Well, my God. Well, on his way to airport security to board the flight. Jones found himself questioned after repeatedly sitting off the middle of the detective. Before the design on the singer's t-shirt, provoked one guard to claim it would prevent him from flying at all. I beat the zeal went to the middle of the detective. Jones is quoted by website contact music is saying, so they took my belt box and phone off. The guy takes me aside and says, You know, you're not supposed to wear that. I said, not supposed to wear what I honestly didn't have a clue. A security man then pointed to the singer's t-shirt, which featured a picture of a pistol with a flame coming out of the top. I was like, what am I going to do with a gun on a t-shirt Jones continued? So we called his superior over by this point. I was like, you're having a laugh mate. So we started asking me if I was in Boston with anything, but it wasn't. I thought he was going to ask me to strip down and change. I mean, it's not as if my t-shirt was loaded. How do I say that? You never did t-shirt was... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Speak of that. When it's Connecticut, a former Stanford police officer has been charged with Lude conduct and evolving a toy banana. Arthur Britanna and the toy Britanna. Arthur Britanna 62 had been on probation for Lude conduct more than four years ago. It was arrested this past weekend after police city playstate 12 banana in this pants and flashed people. All right, great. That is great. Wasn't great for him though. Britanna with charge with Britanna with his banana, which charged with breach of peace interfering with a police officer. All were a span of time. There were several reports of a subject wearing extremely... Ha ha ha ha. This is great. Overall span of time, there were several reports of a subject wearing extremely tight pants with an obvious bald stuck down this pants and Roger Petrony Jr. Lieutenant would allegedly greet patches by on the busy street while trying to draw attention. At times he placed a bag in front of his pants then moved it and showed the bald. It was a yellow-plushed child's toy banana for Trones said, and had a smiley face on it. How do you like that? It was violent atcha. Britanna was released on $5,000 bond for March 21 appearance in Stanford Superior Court in Stanford Connecting it. I guess he won't be doing that again soon. And here comes the best. St. Petersburg, Florida. A five-year-old girl was arrested, cuffed, and put in the back of a police cruiser, actor an outburst at school where she threw books in boxes, kicked a teacher in the shins, smashed a candy dish, and then in the system, principal in the stomach, and drew on the wall. Oh my god. The students were counting jelly beans as part of a, this is a five-year-old girl. The recounting jelly beans is part of a Ronald Reagan-Matthik's size at Firmont Park Elementary School when the little girl began acting silly. That's when her teacher took away her jelly beans outrades you in the child. Minutes later, the 40-pound girl was under the back of a police cruiser, under arrest for battery. Her hands were bound with plastic ties. Her ankles in handcuffs. Oh no. I don't want to go to jail. She said moments after her arrest Monday. Her charges were filed the girl went home with her mother. La police say the directions were proper school officials were not pleased with the outcome. We never want to have a five-year-old child arrested said Michael Beset, the area is the district area three super intended. The district's campus police should have been called to help and not local police. Yeah, who called the cops? Some group ball. She's been appropriately disciplined out of the circumstances. They said the girl's mother in the act and said she's consulting in attorney. She's never going back to the school. They sent my baby up. She said. They sent my baby up. I can smell that lawsuit as in a miles away. Can't you? Yeah, like hang up a five-year-old fat lawsuit. That's not even nearly as amusing as Mr. Britannia with his banana. Now, speaking of not so amusing, they have to rack your rubber plate celebrated as a acquittal on charges of murdering his wife. And the bitch had it coming. A lawyer for the victim's family said he would wipe that smile off his face in a civil court. At a hasty pace. Blake 71, how the Jubilee news conference after being found not guilty, Wednesday and the May 2000s shooting death of his estranged trailer trash wife for six months, Bonnie Lee, basically. The star of the TV show, Barretta, was also a quitted of soliciting former stuntman and murder, basically. And the jury deadlocked 111, defining him not guilty, asking a second stuntman a killer in favor of finding him not guilty. But the verdict's don't end his legal sag and he's also the subject of a wrongful death civil suit, rock by Bickley's family, which was held over to the conclusion of the three months criminal trial. I'm going to wipe this smile off his face, Eric Dubin, the lawyer of Bickley's family told CNN yesterday, Dubin said the family felt that Bickley portrayed in court as a star-struck grifter who ran a mail order sex business, had been murdered twice, once in the car, and once on a stand. I guess that's just to make sure, right? Blake was charged with family shooting Bickley in his car, outside an LA area restaurant. The evidence was largely circumstantial. Based on the testimony of the two stuntman whom jurors said they found. Unreliable. Dubin said he planned to take testimony for the civil case from Blake with intuition, have him back in court in July, and civil cases of vertigo's based on the preponderance of evidence and the jury's verdict does not have to be unanimous. A lower standard of proof than a criminal trial. Kind of like our group's first personal buddy, O.J., right? O.J., and he's paid all I have money back, hasn't he? No, huh? Every dime every cent every day? No, pay. How many cent he paid back so far? Not thirty men. We're sent to the U.S. It's crucially unbiased in the M. Little number, I wrote the other day, while not duck hunting with a judge. Where? You've had in much the MCC. Thank you very much for finding me. Five thousand bucks of fruit, and so I really haven't blocked you. That's all then how he deflies with judge in me. You're so flutty, very much the MCC. For proving that free speech isn't free. The clear channels at the air channel, so how it's done must go. A term, a general astronaut doesn't like strong words and so. He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for rushly low. So if you want to learn too much, so you're very much the MCC. For your rowy curly sitting on your toes. Or Halle button and run all the companies with hail. Let's send them a clear signal and sick Martha straight in jail. She's another day in rich rich, haven't we? Hail, so if you want to learn too much, you're fairing. So you think that's the only thing you do. That you learn everything you do. Your pace may come as real faith. You haven't got a lot to the smile, doesn't concern. Your just a pace if they so far. And ask for condolences, she's an intellectual doctor. So feel your show that we're in love. So do very much the MCC. So giving all the mask is all the way. It really is a bummer when I come to my home. The ozone, the no-go zone, now that Arnold's here to say. The new care intergames are going to take place in LA. So feel also very much. Absolutely. So what the planet fails. Let's save the great white males. And feel feel also very much. He's an old-fashioned, very strict set of Martha Magnumis. Take about a 15, we got most in and by who's another voice of what? Something. Sports something at work. And then we got a mad dog from publics. Holy moly man. He assures, spreading his wings. He's getting around. And he got six or one South Enders having four Lovari. Publics, Curtis Stevenson, and a 10. Any can of 10. And he plunged your guts out, show. Okay, here's the result of the poll today. And this, of course, what I said before, and I won't talk about the steroids again because nobody cares. Nobody cares about those hearings. The thing is embarrassing and humiliating and degrading is a performance was all away around. Especially Mark McGuire and Ellie Anna Rosanna Dana and everybody else. And Jose who changes mind but by the book anyway. Who's your all-time favorite celebrity who died from drugs or booze? And of course nobody's having any hearings about those because, you know, why bother? John Belushi, 126, Jimmy Henry's 101, Chris Farley 85, Lovas 79, right there on the Craper. Jim Morrison 37. He'd be doing a lot better but we left him off. I'll surprise he's only got 37, ain't you? Little bit. That's bad. Maryland on Rho 34, Kirk Cobain 28, he's going to grade. Lenny Bruce 21, John Bonham 21, William Holden 20, Janice Schrauffin 18, Jerry Garcia 17, old dirty 15, by the end of the weekend he'll have about 30 minutes. More than that. Judy Garland 13, Charlie Parker 11, River Phoenix 11, Hutter West Thompson 10, Bon Scott from AC DC at 10, Sylvish's 9 Keith Moons, who I'd now check, Carol Black 9, Freddie Prince 7, how was that show?
