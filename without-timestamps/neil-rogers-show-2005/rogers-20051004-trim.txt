Hello, I'm the General Manager of this radio station. And today is Russia, China, the Jewish New Year. In an effort to celebrate religious diversity and promote goodwill toward other faiths, we brought in a member of the Jewish community to offer our Jewish listeners a greeting for the New Year. Happy New Year! Hey! Hey! It's you! Go home! Look it! Tonight on Fox, lock up the bagels and cream cheese and prepare for a wild ride and Fox presents, when Jews attack. Sponsored by the Committee to a Leg George W. Bush and by KFC, where you can get the new GOP bucket. The GOP bucket is all white-need, right-winged and only 29.95. When Jews attack, right? Tonight on Fox. Hey! Get your Miller drum on board. On the sexy D-Var, looking for a band tour. On the steery early. Very women on a vacant half-band. I've been in bed for a secret in brains. At every dress in the front, in the hands, a sweet snowboard play. It's for you, not for your child. It's like a soap, only for a wild. Get a U-BODY down to watch it Sunday night. Just for a wild. Just for a wild. You're broke. Okay, it's 10.02 at 5.60 WQA. I'm supposed to do the happy New Year thing. I just can't do it. Sorry, dude. You can do it. I'm not going to do it. It's just silly crap. The New Year is January. The New Year is on the entire of all these different, you know, the Muslims and the Jews and the Chinese. Everyone's got their own New Year. See, if we can't even agree on what they knew you're is, how is it supposed to get long, you know? What are? Well, that's right. That's it. That must be part of God's plan because God is crazy. Maybe that's the problem. Is there a Russia-Shona, like, song, a New Year song, traditional kind of a song? A Russia-Shona song? Yes, a Russia-Shona song. Not that I know. You know, like, having a regular song. There it is. All right. They're bad. Your favorite Jewish rock and roll, the stars are bad. It's Russia, Shana, no. Yeah, that's it. Not that I know. Well, a song, and who the hives it, is there a regular New Year song? No, but since it's a religious kind of a thing. No. I don't think there's a poem song either. There's a Dread Old Rade Old Rade Old Rade. A Hanukkah song. Right. Let's play that. It's about 10-S long. Yeah. I hate that. Anyway, we're going to play a lot of long stuff. In us, I like loaded up a couple of minutes at that time. First of all, we don't have the crossover because the Humper is taking off. He's been Jewish today. Always that they used to be, he's going to come back from Charlotte. Must be a real slow trip. Now, he said he was taking off. Yes. And I'll guarantee you next Tuesday when you're, he won't be on next Tuesday either. Okay. Isn't next Tuesday, you can't see it from here. Now, do you think Hank is going to be fasting on you, Kipper? Yes. That's slowly. Good thing. Oh, yeah. It's slow. It couldn't hurt. Let me put it that way. Do a nice fast week. Next week, Comper. What are you employing? I'm implying he needs to lose an answer to it. Couldn't hurt. That's what I'm implying. I will not be fasting because at first of all, I won't even be here. I'll be abroad next week. You have to be here. Yeah. I'll be here. Anyway, you see who died? Oh, I said, yeah. I knew he was a good guy. Yes, he was. Nifty Russell died. Yum, Kipper is Thursday. Next Thursday? Yes. yellowish. You can do a good job. What's up. Good job. This got you. Right there. Look at the 13. Can we do it? Yes. 13. Well, that's an unlucky number. Uh, for I guess, I don't know, maybe for Ariel Cherone, I've got any ideas, who knows, who knows who cares? It's just all a bunch of bobbin' my sees, when you people grow up already. Can you do it? The human race goes stupid. That's the problem. I was thinking that last night I was watching the news. And all these people are killing each other. All the same old tired arguments. that group. Oh, geez. Oh, by the way, speaking that before I forget because I know I'll forget later because I heard it on CNN just once briefly I was in a kitchen and I just yes, do they have to know one time and they said that NPR yesterday morning reported that Harriet Myers, your president's fantastic choice to be the next Supreme Court Justice. I see was a headhunter. In fact, I got to do have the name of the church. Surgeonized scour today to try to find some information about the whole thing about this no paper trail is right now he you Christian church in Texas. She was one of the big hunters and I searched a very very fundamentalist right wing church that that's counseled to ex-gays the X-game movement of course. X-gays. Yeah. Yeah. We don't have a lot of things. That's going to give you a real good tip office to discellating type what she's all about. Come on, you could come around. Oh, you don't come to it. They don't come more right on than the X-game movement. I think about the only thing worse than that is the Jews for Jesus. The funny thing is that they have classes to teach you how to not be gay, how to be straight. In fact, the member of the Christian Zionist movement, which was that on power of nightmares? I don't know. I think you're right. I think it was. They mentioned it. Yeah. The Christian Zionist movement. Some very scary. Yeah. Who love Israel not because they like Jews or anything like that or because they really like Israel. But because we have to carry out this biblical prophecy. Right. And we have to have Armageddon and then of course most of the Jews are going to die anyway because they're not going to accept Jesus. You'll convert or die just like that. You can convert or die anyway. Nipsy Russell. I love it. I believe in convert because he died. Now, I bet you Josh doesn't have any idea who Nipsy Russell was and rightfully so. No. No. Nipsy Russell. In fact, here's a photo of Nipsy. You'll see was posing for a photographer. Something New York premiere of the film, the Abyater. Two day to seven or 14, 2004. Just a few months ago. And now he's dead. Now he's in a box. He's not in heaven. He's not in hell. Little boys and girls. All your kids are off a school today. There is no God. There is no heaven. There is no hell. There is no Santa Claus. It's all the same fairy tales. Okay. There are many fairy's but never there. Russell will play the tin man alongside Dana Ross and Michael Jackson in the whiz. Oh, now you should know who he is. I don't know. It's Josh. I ever saw the whiz. He might have just played the whiz. He's long to wear and stayed TV and film died Sunday afternoon at Lennox Hill Hospital in New York. Anyway, oh, his manager Joseph Rath. I guarantee that Rath was shortened from Rath. If you think guaranteed. That's a very interesting thing about people who change their names and shorten their names. Lot of not as easy to used to. It used to be very fashionable for days to shorten their names because it was like like a tropical love or no, like from Greenburg to Green. Very good. Maybe Bob Green was Bob Greenburg. You think it's impossible. I was thinking about Bob Green this morning. Wasn't where is it? It's a thought to you to by the way, Rockhead. Wasn't positive. I'll pick character. I'll pick character. Yeah. He took carry all right. Here I am. Even though you took him to the swing club and tried to get him laid that time. He still didn't take my damn desire. I was just going to show that. I was going to tell you. I'm going to tell you. I'll wait. He had kind of a cute beard. That's what the Cheryl said. What's their name? Nifty Russell who played the Tin Man alongside Diana Ross and Michael Jackson in the ways that way I already read that. Yes. He'd been suffering from cancer. Born in Atlanta. See, I don't understand this. Born in Atlanta, Russell launched his TV career as Officer Anderson in the 61 TV series Car 54 Where Are You? One of the worst shows in history. Also appeared in the 1994 film version. He became a fixture here we go. A fixture on popular TV game in talk shows. He was on so many games show. Where he was walking with poetics over the early in the moniker the poet laureate of TV. He also took a signature foreline poetry on the road for readings and performances. He appeared in the films. Nimo in 84 Wildcats in 86 and Pasi in 93. Hey, Josh, I'm Pasi, right? Who saw it? What about my mask? And you saw Pasi, right? I don't know. All right. We're still looking. Why would he have seen Pasi? Because it's relatively modern. 93, relatively. 12 years ago. He was like 10 years old at a black cowboy movie Josh. No, he did not see Pasi. He sold in the Yorker in the Adiadi. Adiadi. He never, he never married. He was married to his work just like Harry at night. He was okay. You know what he kind of leads? Somebody says that someone is married to the work that's a code for. That's exactly what they mean. Don't give him this crap. They're married to the work that's in. And then everybody who never got married is, you know, not a nevertheless. He always said I have trouble living with myself. How could I live with anybody else? But he was a wonderful guy. Very quiet, never brag. Nipsy Russell. Good. I do like that. The notice is special that he was going to pour a 40 out of the lot for it. I'll be damned. Anyway, more bad news from Iraq. Four US soldiers and a Marine, five more did US troops have been killed in the tax. The US military said today. The deaths were announced on the same day as US like forces, launched an offensive of the Western province of Anbar where for the troops died. This brings the total out to 1944, but who's counting? 1944 people dead because of lies. A warman in a legal invasion based on a pack of lies based on a bunch of neocon fantasies, lunacy, and a public sits back. But the American Idol coming back. But the look like that. Where's my project? That's what the public is doing. They're all drugged up all screwed up and nobody cares. And then I'm a credit party. They're totally out to lunch. They don't jump on this area at Myers-Bitch. See, she is, actually, this is a pretty clever move. Because she's not one of these openly ratted white wings. She's very quietly trying to portray her. Somebody who's very, very good at two of her. She wants to love. She donated a 10 bucks to Al Gore, 100 years ago, and therefore she's like, but in the meantime, if you really check her record out, which will get to that eventually. Well, they'll actually get to it. She's just another right wing piece of terror. Just another bush toady in chiefs clothing. And another dike. This whole thing is incredibly amazing to me. This whole coat ofery we've got now of self-hating fags and the Jews and blacks. Or like the bush, the bush, not see movement. What is the mainstream media going to pick up on that? They're not. Do a big special review. They're not. It's not a purpose. You can't say that. Nice. You may be. This certainly I can talk about her being a dike. Have you ever heard in the mainstream media anybody suggest? Or ask how come Connie isn't married? Oh, she's very, very do we're work, huh? If we're, or am culture or misplugged you fast. How's your wife doing on it? You're fair. Yeah. Well, he's married to well-in-same. He's only a girl out of there. My favorite. What about? Who? Carl. Oh, Carl Roe. Yeah, Roe, I mean, yeah, yeah. Why do you can, anybody who's ever met real squimmer? You can just look at him and tell he's got that flaming look. He just absolutely. Bye. Hey, man. Carl Roe. So what can I tell you? You know, it's just to the way it goes. The course of people like Bill Crystal and Wolfowitz and Richard Pearl. Allowies people. It's just very sad. And they've taken over the country. And they're running in the rest of you people. Like busy trying to, you know, money together to fill up your tank with gas. Thank you, Mr. President, for those low gas prices. I have gas pains just thinking about him, you know what? Do you notice, it must be the drinking. But when he was introducing her yesterday morning, he looked more bewildered than usual, which is saying a lot. He just, he just, let's be fuddled. I mean, like he's lost like he, in the bag. Just in the city. We worked for work. Not even looking up, very looking up, every time he reads. Here's the poor yesterday who best fits this description of Broadcast. Who does not belong on the air. We had a hell of a battle going. There's 1725 votes and we did cross because we edgeed out Ricky Tiki Sanchez. By two votes, we did cross B-233, Rick Sanchez 231. Lenny Martez is a very strong 3149 and deservedly so. Don't, I'm a 135. Shannon Sharple on 12. I'm pleased to see that Shannon was in the top five and very deservedly so and insult to all of us.

Now it says Moe is on today, can we confirm that on a Jewish, con Russia, Shawna? He's been taking so much time off yesterday, but at Briss in the baby in the whole deal, a grand kid. He's on a ruffle the management. It says Moe 2 to 4, I've just read what it says. Mad dog 4 to 7, Kim Boe camp for 7 o'clock, Ed Kaplan 10 to 2, any kids that are working at night. That is really shocking. It goes to show you how much the troopers we are in this suit. It's interesting about how the Goi and didn't be shrubs today. I've actually had a lot of Nazis not there today. Well, you know, I didn't check that side of the building too. But if stuff said the parking lot was real empty. So everybody's Jewish. I don't know. Speaking of shit. Well, you better get tough on the phone. Get in my inn there, okay? Get in my horn. You're getting my no-horn. Yeah, I've been feeling this going to be happening a lot. I was talking this morning with the audio vaults all screwed up and he went, oh, but it would be pretty good for it like that and he's got a budget meeting this morning and how much money he needs and all this other crap, which has nothing to do with getting the piece of equipment fixed, but nevertheless, apparently they know why it's doing this just nobody's done anything about it. I see. So we know why it keeps doing this and dropping out in the middle of our very important commercials, which is the only reason that we're here, but nevertheless, me and God, I are so true to all these things. I'll know how to do it. I saw you out of my mouth, I thought those things would seem to be a bad cold. That's right. All my friends think I'll know. And that's the redneck bar.

They'd be flailing with it because they owe them Well that they got caught with their damn weapons of mass destruction down with their aren't any and all their lies down And by the way, what ever happened to roll in colon Powell? I had a laugh when they're talking about Somebody needs to be in charge of the mess in with Katrina there and Louisiana and the Gulf States and they're talking about well Either Rudy Giuliani or Colin Powell based on what based on what what it would really Giuliani do be side-go on television after 9-11 What else did he do in you know run around pet people on the back? You mean that's not enough and roll in colon Powell maybe you can hold up a few files of the water from New Orleans say see there's and at least this time it be honest right because we didn't have no answer Action those vials he was holding up there in the U.N. But there would be a lot of crap floating around in those vials because He naturally being a crap specialist that he is rolling cool them total sell out So let's find just take it a shout. Well guess what very you're fairly well, Ferry? Who are you kid man? You self-hating of not just disgusting piece of turd man? You're there things floating in the water in New Orleans that are more worthwhile than you In fact, I've said you're one thing if all people like that whatever that is and I'm not sure there's a specific category If they would have been aborted at birth then the world would be a better place Is now what Bill Bennett said all the term 10 41 at five 60 What are you all said and done at the American people are gonna know what I know that you Much oh no wow talk about the dumbing down of America man Look Uh Four, four, three, four, three, four. The heck did all the wood that you said today? He's got a lot of noise at the door above me that way. Yeah, I don't give a crack what that very message is saying. Did anyone first work? Think something else? That's what I told you. I know, have you know? I know what I'm talking about. Every morning at the condo, I said to yell at me that I'm a... And not my way to the condo, when I call my phone in bed, can I? I give a three condo, think that I'm a rat. The door is a fucking towel. Do we walk out in that yard? Suppose to walk out in that? Somebody. Our Corywing had the subway. There were there in that door. A voice in. I said a song, she sniffed at us. I read her a song. I'm kind of selfish about why you live. I got a whole new spoiled booze. I know everything that's going on in that room. Why you haven't no old and a new modja rule. I'm into the giant daddy or you. Too bad you know I'm not doing my. Too bad you know when I take you straight. I know I ain't no one clearly. But when they drop I boys will change. You're a little smoothing in the world. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. I'm just a bird. Four hundred ninety six votes on a full array. It's not even another clock yet. How do you like them apples, boys? Even Josh might be impressed. I'm more impressed with, uh, we're going to go for four for four on the breaks here. He's keeping score today on the audio vault. Also we're three for three even, yeah, even baby root never were tied cotton and never bed at a thousand. So we're going for four for four for perfect. Now the amusing part of it was that before before the show, Miss Moth will come to every day to pat us on the head and make sure everything is okay. You know, he said, well, we got budget meetings tomorrow. So I won't be with you tomorrow. But, you know, you know, he always got to get a hold of me. In case you need me for like, engineering or something. So you see the, you see the irony in that engineering or something. We've had the audio vault from which by the way, that's a computer that we play our commercials off of on his horseball station, which is one of the worst pieces of equipment, one of the most irre, uh, unreliable. And as a result, that's why every time we go to break Josh's sitting there smack it and it banged at the computer too. And it just, you know, it ain't a plan half the time. So the idea that anybody in there is going to get engineering off their ass, although we are on 24, seven, you know, it's pretty amazing. We got 24 hours, seven day a week programming. Remember that sign on the door? Oh, yeah, we're really great. Where who the hell is he to talk about us here? Nice job in it. Um, Amsterdam studio, by the way, couple of years ago, that was really good. Sound like I was underwater. Juan Cole says Bush done it. And I happen to think that he is. That's so little in character. He says George Stephanopoul is dropped a bombshell on his show on Sunday. Towards the end, he said definitely a political problem, but I wonder George will do think it's a manageable one for the White House. Especially if we don't know what the Fitzgerald is going to write a report or have indictments, but if he's able to show us his source close to this told me this week, that President Bush and Vice President Cheney were actually involved in some of these discussions, meaning discussions about Valerie Plain. The implication is that Bush and Cheney took part in discussions with Carl Roe, Louis Libby, and other administration spin-misters about what to do about that pesky Joseph Wilson from Racting Ambassador to Iraq. What stood up to Saddam in the fall of 1990? Wilson had gone to Niger or as they say now in New Year, in spring of 2002 to check out the story circulating in intelligence circles that Saddam had brought a bot uranium there recently. Vice President Richard Bruce Cheney, when people are illegal probably to traditionally to drop the nicknames, and asked us to see IA about these stories. Wilson and fond that the structure of the uranium industry in Niger, which frankly was in French hands, made the purchases implausible. Wilson did not know what the time was that the stories were generated by actual documents, a set of cumsily forged letters generated by a 10-in-military intelligence officer Raccole Martini, who claimed he was the tool of higher powers. I wonder if he was condemnist or martini from Kukusnest? Wilson wrote his report and assumed it was passed by the NCA director George Tenet, and then spent the Cheney who had initiated the inquiry. Wilson watched with a maizement and outrage as the Bush administration went on relentlessly to hype Iraq's alleged nuclear program as a basis for the Iraq war that they got up. By May of 2003, Wilson had had enough and he went public with mandatory of the New York Times in which he told his story. The whole part of Bushism is to punish dissidents within the ranks immediately and ruthlessly. Wilson, a former state department official, had to be destroyed, having stepped out of line. Everyone should remember that when former Secretary of Treasury Paul O'Neill decided to come out with a tell-all memoir about being in the Bush cabinet for a year he proclaimed, I'm old, I'm rich and there's nothing they can do to me or work to that effect. Then all of a sudden, the Bush administration was finding signs of classified documents and O'Neill's book implicitly threatening him with spending the rest of his life in jail for having revealed government secrets. O'Neill, feebly protested that he had not access to classified documents, but all of a sudden he disappeared from the airways. He discovered that there were two things that could be done to him. He must have been astonished that the bushes of Kenny Bunkport would behave like Vladimir Putin. Everyone always underestimates the malevolence of the bushes of Connecticut. So the Bush team ordered an investigation into Wilson, a quickly emerged that he was married to Valerie Plain Wilson, though the government documents the White House could get hold of just called her Valerie Plain, and transpired that Plain worked on preventing the proliferation of weapons and mass destruction at the CIA. Carl Roe, Louis Limit, Richard Bruce Cheney, and Department of Defense Mafia, considered the CIA an open enemy and out of team player, Richard Pearl, their guru on these matters, viewed the CIA as a hotbed of wimpy liberalism that especially underestimated the depravity of dark skin people in the third world. In short, the CIA was impervious to the Lakudlov, and impressed with the crackpot theories of far-right wing gunflies like Pearl. So the Hot House atmosphere of the White House in 2003, when the awful truth was done in that there were no WMDs in Iraq, Roe's Libby-WM, the big Bruce, and Pearl together with others in the administration to think how to discredit Wilson. They care only about image not substance. It didn't matter that the Wilson had been proved right, and their world only loses if the public sees the truth. The mere discovery of truth in some obscure court is irrelevant. They had to prevent the public from seeing Wilson's truth. So they would leak it that Wilson's wife was CIA, and more overhead, some had something to do with having him sent on his mission. Apparently, among the peculiar tribes that inhabit the press offices in Washington, this information would be enough to tag Wilson as unreliable as indeed a flag for the CIA, populated by water mondails, wouldn't recognize a uranium ship into Iraq, if a caterpillar lift truck accidentally dropped it on their toes. And, sure, Wilson would not be a good faith witness for the secret age, who would they hidden pinkable agenda and so safely dismissed. Roe and Litty were chosen as the hatchet man who would actually talk to the reporters and put the information out. But, of course, Bush and Cheney were part of the deliberations that set the plan in motion. It involved outing a career CIA operative and likely getting her contacts in a third world killed. It was very serious business. Bush would have had to sign off on it, at least early. As long as the Republicans control both houses of Congress, Bush is probably safe, I'm not sure a special counsel like Fitzpatrick could buy himself, ring now to President. But if an Democrats can take the house in 2006, this scandal could turn into an impeachment trial. I've long been frustrated by the US press's tendency to talk about Bush's cabinet officers, as though they were independent agents, and to put Bush on a pedestal. Let me just follow through on some further assertions in the spirit of Stefanopoulos' remark. It is fruitless to speculate about who dissolved the Iraqi army in May of 2003 and why. This will be contributed to the rise of SUNY Arab guerrilla movement. Bush did it. Who ordered the Marines against their vetted judgment to launch a reprisal attack on Fuluga after four Western private security guards were killed and their bodies desecrated there. Bush did it. Who authorized torture at Guantanamo and Abu Graib? Bush did it. Who applauded Michael Brown, a man with no experience in emergency management, had a FEMA. Bush did it. Who led Ben Laden escape from Tura Bora? Bush did it. Who completely destroyed the fiscal health of the US government, forced us into massive that squandering Clinton surplus in invading social security? Bush did it. Bush is the president. He makes the decision. If there's been a major bad decision it's been his. Who ought to validate where the claim is under cover CIA operative? Bush did it. All right. I'd be like that. A lot would I got in the African American community? Yeah, there you go. All 10 of them. 10.56 and 5.60 WCWM.

Evangelist Franklin Graham told an audience that Hurricane Katrina could lead away. Spiritual rebirth of what he called a sinful New Orleans. See, this is why they got to act. Not once, but twice. Twice. They got whacked. There's been satanic worship. There's been sexual perversion Graham said yesterday. An appearance at Liberty University. We're only the craziest of the crazy go. God is going to use that storm to bring revival. God has a plan. God has a purpose. Lincoln Graham. Who courses the son of Billy Graham? Yes. And even crazier than Billy. Graham's comments reported by the News and Advance of Lynchburg were made at Thomas Rob Beftis Church's super conference 2005 at Liberty, the Church in University of Course were founded by the very, very fat and idiotic Reverend Jerry Felwell wither without thinking winky and teletobey. The good news is that God loves sinners. Jesus Christ is coming back and he's alive. So Graham, son of designated successor, brother. He's alive. It sounds like something out of Frankenstein. It's a crime. Graham Sam Arsomer at the first organization. About 500 volunteers helping put new roofs on houses and clean mud and debris out of homes in Mississippi and Louisiana. The organization, however, has been the target of criticism because gift bags distributed into this place children, including Christian tracks and a stuffed land that plays Jesus loves you.

But we also want to convert you to just like mother Teresa used to do the same kind of crap. We're going to bring you two things, ignorance and trotsies and enough where you can't refuse. I don't forget about that. We did not want to help anybody remember that. Graham didn't meet me in return and telephone message left by the A&P today. Norlands historic Saint Louis Cathedral held its first Sunday, mass since the hurricane. Our special Alfred Hughes suggested the city would reveal to the community with a stronger moral threat free of racial tension and rampant self-indulgence. But the Roman Catholic leader, we assure the congregation that God did not cause the hurricane to punish evil doers. So now we get the battle again between this. Whatever he is, the Roman kind of the Catholics and the Protestants against the threat again. Just like Northern Ireland. Who now do we believe any of them? They're all crazy than a bed bug. They're all a bunch of grave robbers. They're all businessmen. That's what it's all about. They want your money. They want your brain and they want your money. And they want your kids so they can bring wash them in some cases. They can abuse them. Use an abuse. I'm going to take a look at that pool. I've been ignoring that. 544 if we really put our mind to it. We can get like at least 600 in a day. Do anything? And where we want to apologize. We only went three for four in the first hour on the audio vault. But it was, you know. That's only 750, even now, Rob Karoon, ever bed at no 750. Even 10 Williams never came close to that.

That guy who got his van stolen from his front house. I'll go first. Okay. Thanks. Hank though driver conversion van. You know by groceries. Other than that. That's right. Was normal groceries. Good point. WQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. You know what's going to do today? Chalbusiness 82. Is he really? Yes, sir. How appropriate have we got this new law in Florida? You know, we got new law. Does the mentioned guns is not a gun law. The other gun law. The other gun is not a gun. How big are you? Is that that was. There's not mentioned guns. It's about use of Delhi force. And one last authorized. It's just a sort of... You know, you have a spear gun there. Yeah. Well, what do you use like a... Power gun? Either. I like a claw hammer. Well, power. Power. Power. Power drill. Power drill. It's a good. Doesn't mention guns. There's another guy trying to defend the defense. That's a good. That's a good. That's a good. Don't be so people. Right. People with guns. It's good. You know, guns don't kill people. People with guns. Crazy people with guns. Kill people. They're a player pathway because they get angry. It's been American effort way. You got it. Don't ever try to reason with those people. Let's see. That's a religion under itself. The whole gun thing. That's way above and beyond any others. The gun is to the gun nuts in the NRA. What the cross is to Catholicism. What the historic David is to Judaism. What the whatever else. All these others. You know, what the bald head is to Buddhism. Is not the simple. A little bit of Buddhism is a Rubin your bald head. Your bald's gone. Yeah. At a orange smirk. Come any QAM hello. Hey, Neil the morning. You looked to what Martha Stewart was wearing. Yes sir. I'm kind of sensing to your. You opposed the new wow wow. Yes, I do sir. Be a manly. Only crazy people would have won. We live in an atmosphere like that. Well, I don't. I'm not. I'm not. I think it. I think it's a good law. I think it's a good law. Well, let me just let me finish because I think it says a serious message that no longer he has to run away and be shot in the back to kind of defend your home or father. You know, I mean, and that's what the floor to law said back then. You have to get all the way. You're the one way or the fact that before we had this law that people in Florida very commonly in South Florida, if they get into an argument of our parking space, they pull out a gun and shoot each other. You're aware of that. I think look, I know your show is a, you know, survives on a pharmaceutical adjueration and so on gas. No, no, no, no. You're going to serve it. You know, which there isn't happen. When I just said, no, I'm not in a, look, I think, you know, people are going to stop her serious legal ramifications. If, you know, it, it, it, it's a ghost down like that. You, you know, you have to be in fear for your life. If you get to assume that some is possible through your window, you know, you get to assume that there is a file. We see you just got through saying about it sending a message. The message that I see it sends to the public is that now you have you, you're more entitled to do these things. In other words, if you feel like you have a confrontation and somebody is threatening to your life or your world, whatever, just blow them away. Well, you know, and then the message very clearly, there's no question about it. There is no other message. No, I, I disagree. I think that the world grows like that. You're, I think that's message I'm trying to emphasize, as I said, their message is a criminal, but you know what, I might, I might, I think second, you know, making take the second thought about, you know, be in need into somebody's house here because, you know, very little should be coming to the window where it's going to be. Oh, you had to, you had to, you had to. Well, let's watch over the next year and watch that. Well, you're right. That's going to be legal matters to be up front, you know, scenarios. And the message that it's out is like the fan ask governor and the legislature, panning gunmots on the back and saying, go get on that. That's the message. And you can try it. And any kind of, kind of, a little way you want to try to make it into something really great. That's going to protect innocent people and all this other crap. I'm going to tell you again for the off to umpteen time. See, here, they've got a recently, last several months in Toronto. We've got a problem with the crazy people using guns and killing people, which one of them doesn't happen. Although the number of murders is still like under 60 for the year. You can do that in the good month in Florida. But the fact is what they're doing is going after. They're not easy. They're not making it easier to blow away people who have guns. What they're doing is they're rounding up the guns and they're going after the gangs. They're like going an afshmit to do whatever they can to stop this. As opposed to the US, where, of course, the gun that's run a country, who has a result as Wild West mentality says, hey, let's just get a whole bunch more guns. They'll keep all them slime balls away from us. Nobody's ever going to get us. People that want to own guns are crazy people. Okay. Unless there's a specific reason for it. See what I'm saying? Like, you live in the dangerous place. Like America, right? So in that case, I go out to 441 when the show is over and I like, I hope a bunch of them. Let me see it again for the last one. I'm going to make it very, very clear. That's my opinion. People who want to own guns are crazy people. They have a major law from sheep. See, there you go again. There's another one. Crazy people. 1113 at 5. 60 WQAM in the market for a new car. Well, don't put it off any longer. Get on down and see my good friends at Armstrong for the homestead.

Like if you're on top going, Let's the work of Athensica behind the wall, and see you're on your neck. Great. You're not taking in any of the cities in Gero Blaise. And we can hear Richard Mughal in the spring. The spring turns outrés on the screen. Relax. That sounds overwhelming. What is this, Scott, less work? More to fill in? That's a great! Hehe! And more to fill in. He's just really a thing to see. And then when it started turning about a lighter shade of blue, that was interest, right? And the arm too, right? That was really amazing. And let's wrap it to Felina put on our titses and our Yamacas and our big, the payess and a whole deal. So, Shire Levy worked today, man. He has definitely got an appointment with the devil. They don't must take about there. Maybe he's a devil's fan. When he talks to Shire next time, see if he's a hockey fan. Well, he's from New York, so he could be a fan. Right. Probably a dangerous fan. Probably a hit hockey, like somebody else we know. Oh, don't talk to him. How much if we refresh that thing? It's got over 600 votes. I could be wrong about that, but that would be quite a feather in our camp. Wouldn't it? It's so full, is what I'm seeing. Guess what Patty Cannon says? Oh, it's really funny about these right wingers having a nervous breakdown about Harriet Myers. Like, rush yesterday. Oh, she was totally on this. This is a decision made on weakness. So, they try and get cheney. They get him out of deep breeze. And they have old Dick cheney, the old geezer getting on a phone call rush. And then he had a call shone, hand it. He was also hyperventilating like all the other right wingers streamers. They didn't pick Eva Brown to be on the court. Yeah. Patty Cannon says, Myers qualifications are non-existent. Nice job, Pat. What do you mean? What his ultimate says? Here's what Patty Cannon says. Another Nazi and drag. And then they once said, I really said something. When you got a fascist like Patty Cannon, a subhuman anti-human individual, who thinks that the Bush people are extreme. That's, that's entirely something. Hand it a once in a generation opportunity to return the Supreme Court to Constitutionalism, George W. Bush passed over and does not be finished jurist of his day to name his personal lawyer. And if a season deeply disheartening to those who have invested such hopes in him, Bush may have tossed away his and our land chance to roll back these social revolution imposed upon us by our judicial dictatorship since the days of Earl Warren. See now Patty, we've heard him to his Nazi path. This is not to his fairer's Harriet Myers. From all accounts, he's a gracious lady. He was spent decades in the law on certainly his Bush's lawyer in Texas and for years by House Council. And she makes her hell of a weaning. But her qualifications for the Supreme Court are not existing. She's not a brilliant jurist and he has never been a judge. She's not a scholar of the law. Researchers are hard pressed to dig up an opinion. She's not had a brilliant career in politics, the academy, the corporate world or public forum, where she not a friend of Bush and female, she never would have even been considered. What commended her to the White House in the phase of the hours that she has no paper trail. So far as one can see, this is Harriet Myers' principal qualification for the U.S. Supreme Court. What is depressing here is not what the nomination tells us of her, what what it tells us of the president who appointed her for and selecting her, Bush capitulated to the diversity among, was used a critical Supreme Court seat to reward a crony and revealed they lasted his item and gamed as a Senate and fierce combat to carry out his now suspect commitment to make the court a the image of Scully and Thomas God forbid and picking her a bush ran from a fight. The conservative movement has been had and not for the first time by prison by the name of Bush. See what I'm saying? So this here's fact, you can't know what's saying that these people were too extreme in the E.O. cons and now they're not a stream enough for him. Choosing Myers, the president passed over outstanding judges and proven constitutionless like Michael Luttagod before it circuit and Sam Toledo the third and if he couldn't take the from the first lady ahead of name a woman what was wrong with U.S. and political church Janice Rogers Brown puts a lot of ones in the E.O. Jones. What must these jurists think today about their president? How does Bush explain to his people, like Brown Owens and Jones were passed over for Myers? Where was Carl Roe of an oldest? He's so distracted by the Valorate Plain investigation. He couldn't want a president against what he'd be doing to his own reputation in coalition. Re-shapingly Supreme Court is an issue that unites Republicans and conservatives. And with his White House and party on the defensive for months over Cindy Sheen and Katrina Iraq and New Orleans, delay in first gas prices and immigration, here was the great opportunity to draw all together for a battle of philosophies by throwing the Gotland down to the left. Send him up the name of a ladigan declaring go ahead and do your worst we shall do our best. Do the Bushites not understand that conservative judges, one of those issues where the National majority is still with them. All in your dreams, Pat, what does it tell us that the White House and something heard of the party in presses putting up that Myers had no paper trail? What does that mean other than this, he's not a win-quest not a Borcus, Khalil or Atomas? Conservative cherished justices and judges who have paper trails. For that means that these women and men have articulated and defended their convictions. They've written in magazines and large journals about what's wrong with the courts and how to make it right. Far right. They've stood up to the pervading wins. They've argued for the Constitution as the firm and fixed document. The following father is wrote not something of wax. A paper trail was the mark of a lawyer, a scholar or a judge who has shared the action and passion of his or her time, taking a stand-by-great questions, accepted public abuse for our articulating convictions. Why is a judicial cipher like Harriet Myers to be preferred to a judicial conservative like Edith Jones? One reason, because the White House fears nominees with the paper trail will be rejected by the Senate, and this White House fears him of all else losing so it is chosen not to fight. Borcus had a chance for greatness and we make this a pre-incorded chance to succeed whereas Republican predecessors from Nixon to his father all failed. He instinctively recoiled from it. He blew it. His only hope now is that Harriet Myers has confirmed will not vote like the ladies she replaced her worst, like his father's choice who also had no paper trail David Souder, like Edith Jones to be a liberal. God forbid, we don't want no liberals packed away. So even the Papy Canon is a foaming at the mouth and bill crystal and Rush Limbaugh and the Anxious Sean Hannity. Father or not, like that. Because we didn't pick a Brown or at least a Hermongering Juni to be on there. Another Scalia God forbid. But you'll see, they'll tell the manipulator. First of all, number one, they'll probably get her through, you know, with flying colors. And number two, once she's confirmed, she'll get on her, no manipulator, just like Edith manipulator. I like Edith with Clarence Thomas, same thing. 622 votes on a poll. What's your take on the new Florida shoot him up, Laura? Maybe when it doubt, take him out. I love it. Can't wait to shoot somebody 157. Only crazy people could support this 164. Only in America, 112. I can't believe it's law 93. I'm out of here. Look how many voted for that. One change of thing 29. I supported 27. So most of our audience, that are in favor. They don't just support it. They want to start using it. But I'm going to give you to the right to go to the whole few people away. Let's go. I'm thinking it's not even the fourth already. One of them who are on Saturday, and it's Tuesday, I'll read it. How many people have you killed so far? I'm not third in man. Good job. It's still before noon though. Next, too. You're a lot of time. So if we verify that Moisturistician is at true, because that, well, I'm going to tell it is going to be a long line there, and then some people probably gates. If they're, if they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're, they're having one of the gates in hell. Do we know? Crathas, Bill Gates are, I think it's called V Gates. This is New Roger. This is five of V Gates's help. Are you wounded? I get the day when someone does wrong, but we didn't take their drive. In Pearl Harbor, or when the jets drop their box, we found them back. And now the sonny is late in a sign. And on our cards are little flags, wait. At that sonny, who love and recharge points of honor, the wrong way. To support the rest of it. To по friends to the universe. And all are saying that, then you're in his way. Don't warn him, of it. And when I seeος and now I got mad. a formas. We always say, it's nice to care for you who neverOpen aash for you. So, I say, maybe they didn't hold my hand. Give us a... What's of you, thousand innocent lives? Stop living in the mess. If you want that SUV to drive, you're gonna need more gas. It's like greatest country in the world. They train us to believe, and anyone who says that, obviously, it ends up for to be. And not in Paris to be in America, where we take three hours in police. Wave a flag and one has to win our head in the sense that, like, we follow the power that we have to say. Watch the state from you, who's on a 65-3, scratcher, five everything's okay. Let them be, like, two as a... Number 32 of five, 60, WQM, happy Tuesday to you. I'm probably taking at least three-four hundred calls between now and two. I'm sure I'm sure they'll find these people all whipped up about this new law. Five, six, seven, five, 60, because this is gonna send a message to them. Criminal's man is gonna make life a lot safer for all of us to this law-bied ones. I'll see what he calls on there though. I was just gonna roll it up a whole bunch. And now, when the delay keeps in, about what 15 minutes, what's the hear the invite man? And it'll be all over the place, like, stink on gray. I got a really good article later about it. It's gonna finally answer the Greg Weed dilemma. Like I said, it's a great article. Oh yeah, liars brains are not the same. Okay, this is from the BBC. This isn't a joke. This is about the white matter and the grey matter and your brain and about the liars have this thing. So like when you do the lobotomy, WQM, hello. That liar's level, you'll never... WQM, hello. And yeah, I'd like to change the subject from politics, a law for more employees, and mention, hear Augustine, you know, that is? No. The guy who goes crazy, derriarch, search up on the Googleman, KIARA, Augustine, the best. Yeah. And he puts the fun back in the chicken off, Neil. Great. Okay, let's, uh, the two... This will not be in front for me. 560, 0560, pound 560, leave a rise. Obviously he's been busy. And no question about that. WQM, hello. Pretty good. Let's say anybody brought up your Hampshire or what is gun thing? They brought up New Hampshire? Yeah, New Hampshire has open gun laws. And they have one of these... What if what does that mean open gun laws? They can dare a lot to carry without concealed weapons permit. And they have one of the smallest crimes crime rights in the country. Yeah, so what does that prove? Well, you just made the statement of, you know, it's going to be the criminals or it's going to be the criminals better watch out. The fact that I didn't say that, but you just said that because I was joking, I was being sarcastic about all that. But I had before. But not in here in a chicken car. But think about it isn't I'm not in, you know, I'm not a good lover or anything else like that. But statistically it does work and it works in your Hampshire anyway. Sir, let me say this to you, okay. The gun laws, and for example here, if you were saw going for Columbine, Michael Moore pointed off that they got like, I forgot how many made in the guns in Canada. And yet people aren't shooting each other, okay? They don't kill each other. But I didn't tell anyone. They just didn't, the people who have them and they're either attitude about them. And also in the case of Florida now, it's what the government says you shouldn't shouldn't be doing with them. You're a hoi, it affects your whole attitude about what the gun represents to you. Absolutely. I mean, you know, most of the guys that have guns are smaller guys that have been picked on other lives. There's no question about what they're doing. My short. You better watch it. Look at me. Don't even smell you, right, George? That's right. Good shot. WQAM. QAM. Why are we central? They're not by our eyes. Yeah, or he wants to see the other guy. He likes his voice. WQAM. Going once. Going twice. WQAM. Okay. Does he love me? I can get this, all the drivers are out. Because they can pull out a weapon. If somebody cuts you off and traffic, that's it. That's going to be a one thing. I'm not going to have to get myself a shotgun because I have to shoot the lead. 247 baby works every time. I'll never do it again. The governor will come down well and from the side of your voice, so the governor might not give you a medal, but, you know, consider the source. All right, but. They're going to like them dark folks. Thei is very nice job as a family innocent. They think they can actually be a family innocent. Unless.癌 taste like he tells too much about his table and how did he tell? Is not because he's gone that for you. Oh, lift really? Well, I got it. George Bush doesn't care about Black T-T. George Bush doesn't care about Black people. George Bush doesn't care about Black T-T. That's right. They don't vote for him anyway. Just like James Baker, the turd said, we don't care about those Jews down there in Florida. They don't vote for us anyway. Back in the fixed election of 2000. Back when he was getting everything all finagle. Or now actually he said that back in 90 when Bush won was running. Those Jews down there don't vote for us anyway. Right. Of course they said it out of Florida in 2000 to help get to fixing with cancer in here and find out Governor. All of this stuff. And a public justice back. See one thing I'll say the American people now, unlike the revolutionary days, are the most passive people. And there are aggressive only in terms of the criminal. It's really aggressive. And of course, in terms of the way they use guns. I'll say it again. It wouldn't be a problem if everybody owned a gun if people were like civilized and they had respect for a human life for other people. But American Americans not the case. That's going for colabine again. Watch this statistics. And see how many gun murders there were in France in that year. And in England and in Germany and in Canada and all these other places were some civilized people live. And then take a look at the USA and then you know extrapolate the population. Like the thing he does about Windsor Ontario and Detroit. You know, I love when he interviews the police chief in Windsor and he says, I ever have any murders here. I said, oh, you know, I had one a few years ago. A few years ago. I've ever heard a such thing a few years ago. My ass, the American. And you see the reaction there have been here about the recent spate of gun murders that are going on in Toronto. You think that the sky was flying because the people just they don't want to live in that kind of environment. They don't put up with it. But in America, you just take it for granted. Like, all Jay, one other, you know, 10 people got shot and murdered over the weekend. Well, must not be in that bad of a weekend. Civilized people don't live this way. People have any value on human life, don't live this way. And that's why it's so easy to American people. So, I think people are so malleable now and all these statistics coming in 1944 dead soldiers in Iraq and of course we don't even count the civilians, the men women and little babies that are dying over there by the thousands. We don't even keep track of that because there's no premium on human life. It's as cheap as water. Yeah. What is there to say about it? It's pathetic. It's like cockroaches, man. Just step on another one. That's it. And yet, at the same time, oh, well, man has a soul. You know, when you ask, well, how come dogs don't go to have a dogs or wonderful noble creatures in the very, you know, lovable? Well, dogs are man is the only creature that God created with a soul. Well, and if that's the case, how come we have such so little of value on human life? Choose life and then go out and go one. I guess before you kill somebody, you got to choose which one, right? So choose a girl and you can kill it. Can't be too choose either. Not a Florida. Wow. Six hundred and sixty nine votes. We're going to be way over seven hundred at the top of the hour. I'm rush your shot in the list. Eat your heart out. Moichi, put it. This is new Rogers. This is five sixty two eight. Oh, you two can turn your pagan ways around at Earl Strites' will convert any go if we're just ninety nine ninety five. That's right. Listen to one of our successful graduates. Oh, Kim. Isha'lam. Malahe. Hatsha'lam. At Earl Strites' will convert anyone into a Jew. Malahe, Ken. Hatsha'lam. Tremble. Translated means sorry. I must have left my wallet at home. You know it. Me la'ke'e. Tamalaheem. Hatsha'lam. Translated means. Sturdist. Did you make sure to give me a kosher meal? Me ne'erak. Mahalaheem. Tamalaheem. Hatsha'lam. Tremble. Hatsha'lam. Translated. Yes, Rabbi. The check is in the mail. Yes, you two can convert into a Jew for just ninety nine ninety five at Earl Strites' House. Now, I'm getting a free yardside candle for just ten dollars. Earl Strites' will convert any goi for just ninety nine ninety five or more if we can. Tamalaheem. How about let's put some read backwards for Christ's name. Anyway, this in response to this fact here, it says I'm sorry for bothering you who played in earlier, but in celebration of the Jewish New Year of the Jew year, guy who Earl Strites' and the song that starts the McQueen is Jewish. Could you believe it? The only problem that is I don't know what that is. It's called the whole world is Jewish, but I'm right. The only thing I have to hold word is I'm cut. Like a car man. Right, where the whole is that? I don't know. Trash of you McQueen is Jewish, could you believe it? Huh? I know we got it. It's somewhere it's much less. Exactly, I know we got it. Maybe it's not a cart. Oh, God. But I don't got it. By the way, I do have the whole world as I'm cut. I'm not sure we can play that. No, I'm not sure. But you've been knocking the Jews for Jesus for a long time. And I've been rethinking my whole religious position. Yeah, the sake of efficiency and benefits. Being a Jew for Jesus means you get to take all the holidays off. I've had some frills in my life. Two free bags was in sight tonight. Such books. I'll also say nobody lives in Ethan New Hampshire. Maybe that's why there is no crimes going on. I'm thrilled about my cars. Two quarterbacks and I'm hungry. I'm thrilled that my throat is a thrilling evening. When I finally found out. Louis McGell was on circumcised. Can you believe that? It's such a pile of crap. With a little flap. Carrey Bruce once was what could have been true. That's beautiful. I'm not going to press my lock. You're seeing that show press your lock? Yeah, I'm not pressing it. My press and pants. But I'm assuming I press my lock. Anyway, what do we got here? We don't want to get Jewish. 690 votes. 14 to the hours. So we got like no problem getting over 700 by noon. That's shocking, man. It is really something right on the wall. Mark it down. I see. What's this other piece of Joann says? My husband said this Supreme Court nominee looks like a boozer. Oh, well, hey. He hangs out with a president. He really is here. We should vote. We don't think our lucky star is here. Not many young healthy person. Yeah, she's 60 and maybe she's in. I could be around too long. And I could raise. Yeah, what should be around long enough though. I think tell them overturn the Rovi Wade. It's better all the history of the right wing. You'll see. She'll be an easy one to a mold and manipulate and shape. And then that song. Ben Lee shaped me by the who did that. Ben. Merkin. Merkin. Ben me. Who did that? Merkin. Merkin. Very right. I'm turning it off, man. I'm going to be a crap music. I mean, I know like a music from that era. I mean, after you get to 980, I know nothing. See, when you're in this business and used to be a district, right? There it is. Then we shaping force. It's on. When if you're playing music on the air, that's one thing. Now when I was in Zeta, I got to know music that I hated because the TV bulger was the PD and he had like the same 7 CCR records you want to play every day. I had a DJ country music. I don't know if you ever did. But I know I did not. And then you got to sound like you like it. Here comes weightling, Denny. They weigh in. They weigh in. They weigh in. And it makes me want to get on that time life website and start earning the great country hits. I do like Marty Robbins and Mike Pinkhoton sport carnation. It's about it. This is about like 5. 694. The votes are trickling at one at a time. Now you can post better get with it. If you like Taylor off on a pole right now, leave us hanging here. That's going to be really embarrassing. Anyway, this is from the Boston Globe. Let me say it again. Here we admire. She was heavily involved in Texas in the value of your Christian church. She was a really heavy duty going with this real right wing fundamentalist church who especially was that they administered to ex-games, which is code for she's in the closet. If I'm surprised she's in the Scientologist. They don't quite that well. And the ex-game movement is the same thing as the Scientology. It's a big closet. That's like the Catholic priesthood, same thing. Supreme Court nominee Harry and Myers went on record favoring equal civil rights for gaze when she ran for the Della City Council. And she said the city had a responsibility for aid education, patient services. But Myers opposed repeal of the Texas Sotomay Statue to low overturned in 2003 by the court on which she will sit if confirmed. And a survey she filled up for a gay rights group during your successful 1989 campaign. She opposed repeal of the Sotomay Statue. Almost makes me want to play that. In fact, the only one I'd like to best about that is just the first note. The first sour while we saw her. That's just, it's fancy angel dating by working in the regels. The survey by the lesbian gay coalition delus provides a hit of Myers thinking on homosexual rights issues that could come before the court. All she came to a coalition meeting to length of questions during the campaign. She said at the time she was not seeking its endorsement. These Supreme Court struck down the prohibition on consensual homosexual sex by six to three vote. Just a standard gay or condom of Myers is nominated for his vote over the majority. Myers answered yes to the survey question. Do you believe that gay men in lesbian should have the same civil rights as non-gay men and women? She answered no when asked whether she believed both had a citizen as an legislative legislature that criminalization of the privatization behavior of consenting it out lesbian's ingation would be taken out of the Texas criminal code. She said, Dallas had a responsibility in age education treatment and that she favored more money being spent in that area assuming need and resources and a part since in a third place. He's very ambiguous. She's all over the place. She's a rightful like she's a fetus hugger and you'll see it. I'll get her right in there and by the big magic. Speaking of religions and crazy people and priests and all you kids are out of school today because it's a Jew holiday. Let me say it again. Your parents, they may not be bad people but they've been brainwashed just to like their parents were before them and they've been conditioned to lie to you and tell you all these terrible things about the tooth fairy and about Santa Claus and all these are the boogie men of the bed and about the angel Jesus and Abraham and Solomon and Abraham. So they lie a lot. So just use your own brain and ask yourself, is any of this make any sense? Of course the obvious answer is no. So just tell them next time they want to shut your ass to show them, tell them, cut the horse and go out and get a leave or something like that. Go out and have a good time. Go get a hot pot Sunday. Judd says, priest likely killed two people in 2002. Too many didn't move to Florida. Look at it got him off. So to speak, a judge ruled yesterday that a Roman Catholic priest who hanged himself in December. He ever heard of a hung priest. Almost certainly killed two people out of here with home more than three years ago. Circus judge Eric Lundell's finding came in the case of reference Ryan Ererson who committed suicide after being questioned by police about the 2002 slaying. Oh my God. I conclude that Ryan Ererson probably committed a crimes in question. On Dels' 17 of a day long hearing on a scale of 1 to 10, I will consider it a 10. It is a very strong case of circumstantial evidence, the whole world of circumstantial. The testimony also established a possible motor for the slings. The funeral director suspected the priest was molesting children and planning to confront him in the day of the killings. How do you like that? The funeral director suspected the priest was molesting children and planning to confront him the day of the killings. The coincidence it sounds like to me. Then that sounds like he did confront him. After hearing a decontestify that Ererson confided that he shot at a funeral home director Dan O'Connell 39 and employed James Ellison 22. He tells me, I done it and they were going to catch me. I done it. This is in Wisconsin. Yet, I didn't think they spent a while Hudson was constant. Probably a bunch of red necks. He tells me, I done it. They were going to catch me. He can rustle on grintestify. They were going to catch me. They did learn all the little kids. Although Ererson cannot be charged, the victim's family is requested to hear into the term who is responsible for the killings. The so-called John Doe hearing is used only in a few states. Typically, as an investigative tool, the hearing was closed to the public, but some reporters were allowed to attend. The day the funeral director was killed. He asked school to a bus driver, Mary Paykel, if she had never seen the priest touch out in a properly and said he had a meeting with Ererson that afternoon paykel testified. Paykel said he would or Colonel Mop to meet the priest alone. She said he urged him to talk to police first. Then told me, I can handle it. Paykel said, well guess what, Dan, when he came, police would be the leader of Colonel Mop. Once in the heat, an Ellison was killed when he came to the office to see what happened. Ererson 31 was found hanged December 19 from a fire scape at the Mary's church in Hurley. Some days after he was questioned by police and did not have any involvement in the killings.

But the British Journal of Psychiatry said that we're likely to be more differences in the brains of liars. Participants were volunteers drawn from five temporary employment agencies in LA. Three separate groups were studied. The first consisted of 12 men and women with a history of being pathological liars. The second was 21 people who did not have a history of lying or anti-social behavior. The third group was 16 people and a social personality disorder but no history of pathological lying. They were studied to see if they showed the same brain makeup as liars. The researchers drew up list of criteria for lying, cheating in the receiving, including having such as calming people or behaving manipulatively and telling lies in order to obtain sickness benefits. They also assist how much gray and white matter people had in the pre-frietyal cortex areas of their brains using MRIs. Liars were found to have between 22 and 24 to 6 percent more white matter than either those with no history of lying were those in the anti-social group. The findings could not be explained by differences in age, ethnicity, IQ, head and gender or substance misuse. This is the first that issue of brain difference in people who lie to manipulate others of researchers. They said the study could not be searching areas such as people who have been illness. The findings are in line with previous studies which show children with autism are less capable of lying than other children. How do you like that? So it's in the brain and to be honest, we're going to be in every new great hand one. This is Neil Rogers. This is 568. You'll find word would put up with that. One moment please.

Yeah, you do. You are. You do me that one time. I thought he he's good. He's got a great voice. But he's like, oh, all from elementary to middle. I'm not a con just as I just work for. I handle him. He just drives me nuts. The case raises fundamental questions about blood roll if any religious face should play me. A medical justice system. I refuse to take a die. Coral leaves in place. A patrofair conflicting rulings by state and federal judges across the country of what to do by bibles in the jury room. When it does throw them out. Okay. Clash them down the turlet. In addition to Colorado, the Supreme Court of Kentucky, Oklahoma and Tennessee, suggest Bobbi used to enumerations undermines the defendants right to a fair trial. That is shocking, isn't it? I love it, though. In those states, Kentucky, Oklahoma and Tennessee, the Supreme Court of those states suggest Bobbi used to enumerations undermines the defendants right to a fair trial. I say, hallelujah. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying that. I'm saying that. I'm saying that. A couple of things. First of all, I don't have time. Bobbi, sorry. We love you. The central issue in Colorado versus Trailer was whether a jurist citation of two Bible passages to fellow jurors undermined the defendants. Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. Jurors are routinely told throughout a trial that through the basic operations in the case solely upon the evidence presented in court and the judges instructions on the applicable law. The applicable law. They repeatedly caution to avoid news coverage of the case that might include details about the crime or the defendant that the judges decided to exclude from the jurist consideration. But the jurors and Mr. Holland's trial were also told by the judge that it was there job to make an individual moral assessment that death is the appropriate punishment rather than life and prison. For many individuals, I got to interrupt this and do the brave. I don't want to let short changes. So this is heavy duty, stuff, man. It's about all these fairy tales, all these religions, all these Bible thumbfers, all these crazy dangerous people. Besides, we don't know how long the break is going to take. Well, that case. I think it's going to work this time. I have a kind of campaign. I need to. Okay, the case is so. What do they call this thing? It's a lot of people. They sort of want to, I find a court-leaning court-leaning man. And you know what Lucas said? He said you were a reall-leaning. If you came to the court-leaning, but it's just found over. Oh, look, we'll see. Let's see. Paul ain't no more. I think about when Clemenza got out of the car. In fact, he created a new river in the New York. He took such a big leak. That was shocking. 12-13 president. We want to back, Bob. Let's think about right now. George, we want Bob. Yeah. No more bubble micees. We want Bob or Clinton back. Now, he can even bring monarchy in there for a little oral amusement.

So as my imagination, I'm sure that George Corse of the Fabulous job in fixing that audio vault. But it sounded like muff and the first spot there was like in the warlands. We did the same thing. We're having a conversation about that. That sounded really funky that first spot. And if I was okay, why? We're playing the spot set of the main studio right now. So you said that it was thickest. Well, they're fixing it. That's why we've been having our issues. I see. Right. To hang our issues. Anyway, again, back to this very important story about the Bible and all these other fairy tales on a junior day. But the jurors in Mr. Harland Trail were also told by the judge that it was there to make an individual moral assessment that death is the appropriate punishment. The rather than life in prison. For many individuals making such a moral assessment involves deeply held beliefs about right and wrong. That touch our matters of religious faith. Religious faith. Oh my God. If jurors are permitted, even encouraged to use their religious places. A basis to reach a verdict in the death penalty case. Prosecutors in the Harlem case asked why would consultation with a religious person. The consultation with a religious text automatically invalidate that approach. The Bible episode arose after a long day of deliberations into the Harlem case. One juror in particular said he was reluctant to support a death sentence because it clashed with his faith. The jurors first name. He zoos. Oh, he zoos. That night several of these sequestered jurors consulted bybles in their hotel room seeking passages to counter the jurors' concerns. The following day, at least one of the jurors brought a Bible to the deliberations to share her research with other members of the jury. The juror quoted Leviticus 242021, which reads in part, I for an eye to for a truth he that tells the man he shall be put to death. All this is that loving compassionate goddess is be sure and cure all their enemies and don't miss any of them. The jurors also pointed the Romans 131. Let every soul be subject to the governing authorities, but there is no authority except from God. And the authorities that exist are put in by. They will come. By noon that second day, the juror returned a unanimous verdict of death. But here in Ask God, and actually he's going to say, kill him. Tell us on a bit, right? Right, aren't. The district judge of the Vertorland's death sentence said the jurors in property where we lied on a biblical code to dictate their verdict. In fact, the Bible became a 13th juror in the deliberations. Jury resort to biblical biblical code has no place in a constitutional death penalty proceeding the judge said. And he of course is. Absolutely correct. In a three to two decision, the Colorado Supreme Court agreed, that using a Bible injury room during deliberations undermines a capital defendants right to refer to a trial. Don quick, used to drive a Jackson raceway, by the way. Don quick district attorney in Bretton, Colorado says in his U.S. Supreme Court brief that their Colorado high-core ruling means that the mere presence of a Bible during death penalty deliberations automatically prevents a fair decision. Most of the quick says the correct question should be whether the Bible exerted any improper influence upon the jurors. The evidence attorney chief of public deputy public defender Kathleen Lord, my sweet Lord, this agrees with quick assessment. This is not a case involving the mere presence of a Bible during deliberations he says in the brief, rather the district court made extensive findings as the jurors actually use of mandatory death penalty passages from the Bible during deliberations. When questioned under oath and a postural hearing the jurors denied that the Bible passages dictated their deliberations inverted, the judge rejected their testimony is not being credible noting the script and sees them on the very jurors account today. The judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge said the judge yeah that's Mohsen in being sir liked most that's like the be-esyllis five six-co Phil thing don't confident that's all out and said that injustice line there they call every claim thss Statistics a was wrong, it wasn't a remake, I was confusedly, gravely, remake, like I was confused, middle street, put them close, but I was close.

No, the 18-year-old, Broward man is facing a secondary misdemeanor charge for allegedly breaking his glass on his jail cell door. But it's Lionel's got serious problems. I think Mommy ought to be like in there with him, right? She's still FHP in it. Yeah, thanks so. As it stands, Tate is already facing a potential life sentence and connection with his arrest after a domino's pizza lover man was held up in May. Acting circuit judge Joel Asv is expected in your evidence on a case October 14. Tate was 12 years old when he fatally beat a 6-year-old playmate Tiffany Unic in his pegrin park home in 1999. And appeals correlated reverse the conviction site of concerns about what the Tate understood illegal proceedings. He served three years in juvenile detention was released on probation January 2004 in November. Determined that Tate and Violated in terms of probation, the BS deputies found him in a park about 2-30 in the morning with a knife. Lans are a lot of them to go free, tacked on an extra five years to ascend your probation. If you did a clear warning that he would have zero tolerance for any future violations, and addition to the pizza whole of up case, Tate must now answer charges related to this more recent incident. On August 25, Tate was kicking and banging on his jail cell door, then through a hard-pasted box at the glass, shattering it, BS folks from Jim Layton all said this morning. And found guilty on the charging face of maximum 60 days in prison could be found up to 500 bucks. When you're on probation for murderers, supposed to be haibier self-laid, all said any kind of violation law can send you to prison for the rest of your life.

No, it's too good. 1247 and 560WQJAM. Now, you're probably a big pit bull fan. I'm not talking about dogs. I'm talking about rap music. Oh, yeah, it's my boy. Well, I got a good news for you. All right. The bull fans may have a new CD to put on their dear send list. This upcoming holiday season. How do you like that? All right. A Miami judges fund that slip and slide records can release an album of the Cuban American rappers old tracks. That is currently a new CDT record sought to block. Okay, so I'll double the same. Oh. Okay. In a 26 page of Penny, US District Court judge, a magistrate Stephen Brown said, Miami based slip and slide has the right to issue the LP. Welcome to 305 as long as it fixes a sticker to its stating, contains previously unreleased material. We couldn't be happy or said slip and slide attorney, Richard C Wolf, we think the judge absolutely understood this case. Absolutely. Brown's opinion is a recommendation that goes to a US District Court judge, will either accept an issue of fine order against TBT or hold a new hearing if he feels they might just rate error in the report, the error in the or. Or magistrate recommendations are usually accepted by the overseeing judge nevertheless, TBT lawyers and they plan to file objections to Brown's report a bit over turn it. They preliminary report recommendation by the magistrates is only that a recommendation out of final decisions that run a charter TBT's lawyer. New York based TBT records wrote Brown wrongfully interfered with slip and slide's business last spring when it's in dozens of letters to the distributor saying that the album schedule for May release was illegally recorded. Legal wrangling aside, we believe pitiful fans won't find any real enjoyment from these abandoned unfinished demos, which to us sound like snippets of old performances were cut and paste it on the new beats, without pitch creative involvement cooperation or approval. Slip and slide had 100 and 3000 orders worth some 800 grant for the album, which contains songs pitiful, aka our mind of pattern as we couldn't 2001 when he was an unknown. How do you like that? I mean, is he alive? Is he dead? Is he alive? He's alive? It's just here that like couple months ago. Brown also moved to the fact that pitiful himself and not boys in the opinion in the case, the court finds extremely significant the fact the artist himself is not a part of this lawsuit and the lack of any evidence that he's expressed any negative feeling for the release of 305. We'll have said slip and slide may not have enough time to get the album to stress for the holiday season, and that event will label we'll be back in court asking TBT for some $4 million damages for law still. Who the hell would buy that crap? I mean, that's really good stuff, you know? That's my favorite. Come on, you can do it. As you call the Terrent Teller, is that today's? Okay, that's all right. Does that sound right? Terrent, I don't know what it is. It's just a lot of fun. It's a bad game all the time. 860 votes and I've pulled man. We may have close to 900 by the end of the year, 12 o'clock hour. This is staggering on Roch Hashona, no less. Roch Hashona on the juire. By Roch Hashona tonight, it's all a bunch of crap. Okay, that's bottom line. All of this. The Muslims, the Jews, the Christians, the Buddhists, the Hindus. It's all the same swirl. Okay, it's all a bunch of it's a waste of your time. Life is short and joyed. Okay, don't waste your time debating over other God. Lord said, they're saying don't waste your time. Don't don't dignify morons by a young man. What do you say? It's a waste of time. Oh, I think I just said that. All right, pointless. Gordon is tough as the Japanese are. I'm sure your daughter learned that when she was over there. That's right, whatever favorite dishes. Media, media everywhere. No time less to think. The average American is a ravenous media junkie consuming up to nine hours a day at television, a web time or cell phone minutes, according to new research, which raises fresh questions about how technology is revolutionizing society, aka the Domingue of America man, are they doing a fantastic job? From iPods filling commuters ears, the screens scrolling headlines in the elevator work to proliferating on the move tools like cell phones and blackberry handles. And I said again, my flag for is one of the best investments I've ever made my life. All right, media is everywhere in the United States, like much of the rest of the developed world. And his information technology marches on and search engine giant Google even raises the prospect of free wireless internet across for access for whole cities. Media and all its forms is almost impossible to escape. You know, they're suggesting the whole city of San Francisco is going to go access for free. That sounds kind of gay to me. What does this mean for society said professor Bob Pappert, co-author of a study at Ball State University in Indiana, which started mass media use by Americans. I'm a Pappert Europe pepper. There has been plenty of speculation on the impact on the daily life of a fast expanding media. One theory for instance has it that as people become more and more connected electronically, they're becoming less and less connected personally. All boy, some experts question whether as consumers are swamped by information, they lose the ability to decipher facts for more or find it hard to think through what they hear. There's swamped there overwhelmed with information, with misinformation, with propaganda. And the academic research has yet to prove where this proves that Steve is said, Pappert, who's launching a series of companions that is including one probing why people are spending so much time online on the cell phone and watching TV and how the personalities are affected. The average person spends about nine hours a day using some type of media, which is arguably an accessible thing we've envisioned ten years ago he told AFP. Now he doesn't mention anything about radio on here. Right. What's that? I don't know. Something people used to listen to. The Ball State Survey found that while television was still the most dominant media device used by the average American computers, we're catching up fast. You bet. You bet. When he comes back tomorrow, you give him an ultimatum. You tell me the research used in that computer is, or we're going to give him what for. We're going to take away that salami sandwich on your own kipper. When we combine time spent on the web using email instead messaging and saw for such as word processing, they computer clicks is all of the media with a single exception television paper said. I mean like that, computer is number two right behind the old TV. That's incredible to me. It is. Get with it. Get with it. Old spotty ready. The Ball State Study Parsley confirms findings of a major look in the growing internet use among Americans, published in January this year by the Pew Internet and American Life Project. On a typical day at the end of 2004, 70 million Americans went online to use email. Get news, find health and medical information, book travel or countless other activities, a figure 37% higher than four years before the survey found. That figure looks set to grow as new low cost technology spread to benefits of the worldwide web. The social group so far could out of the information revolution. Google is announced a proposal for free wireless internet access for the entire city of San Francisco and a new project from MIT and visit you as a hundred dollar laptop to be handed out first to Portrait and Development countries. Not in Cuba though, not in China. Like China needs our computers. No, not the day they, well, I mean what I'm saying is that they aren't going to be able to access the internet. Oh, great. So whatever the Chinese government lets them, let's see what I'm saying as I say, Carmi. Now let me ask you in Cuba today, did they allow computers? How about you? What do you mean you better get with an account Mr. and have a little no speaking place seminar. He said they're in a while either. Yeah, he's never been there. Yeah, that's where. You know, so that never be like me giving you a son and it's about Israel. You know, what do I care about Israel? Am I going there? No. Have I ever been there? No. Do I have any desire to go there? No. No. I'd go there and eat cheeseburgers just to piss them off as well. I would do that. I would just put a whole bunch of, yeah. I can't keep it. I need to bring some bacon if I wait on our liberal opens. We ever find out on that? No. The mudway, the Ball State study among 400 people in last few months, Channing, charting five thousand hours of being used track 50 different media and gadgets including TV. Books magazine cell phones. The internet instant messaging and email. You know, it's again, no radio. That's great. I told you radio was done then and it was on top of that or what? Yep. Radio is finito, baby. Toss it in the turtle along with that Bible. Among the most interesting conclusions with that 30 percent. But, third man. With me, the time has spent on one or more device as people perhaps have an eye on the latest reality show on TV while shuffling through their email. See that? I see it. Another surprising fight is that 18 to 24 year old spend less time online than any other age group. Except for the over 65s giving the light of the idea that young adults are the most computer-literate. That's that all of the food. There would be a good way. Oh, well, Josh is online and he's busy getting latest what? You can do both. Yeah, you can do the same time. There we go. If media usage increases on Fridays based on the assumption that people are planning social activities, then this will be potentially the best day to advertise movies, Rick and Food Specials, other products, and Matt Mike Blocksham, never the ball station research thing. You know, one of the little schooling balls state. That sounds really gay to me. And it balls up. Oh, come on. Balls out. Balls act. Eight hundred and seventy eight votes on a poll at 1256.

A new study that followed Americans for three decades. And just that over the long haul. Nine out of ten men and seven out of ten women will become overweight. Oh, how do you pressing to light? How do you pressing? Find out. Where to give the money in the short run place? There's gum on. You're talking about the money is set up and so on. He's not looking too good today. Is he?

The tea foul president. By the way, did I ever do the thing on to your about Teflon and Teflon and the bad stuff in there? How do I talk about it? You didn't let me forget to go out and buy an aluminum frying pan. Do you use a Teflon? Not anymore. Don't, we had one of those, you know, skill and not that skill. The grills. Those grills with the Teflon coating on it. But it broke all back. Well, not that we got our flavor way. We don't need to be frying no fried pan. Most things. It's kind of hard to make like an umber. But it gets, uh, get stainless steel. Don't get aluminum. Like I said, I'm going to go on. Give me a stainless steel fry pan. And I'm going to beat the crap out of somebody with it. It says, even if you're one of lucky few made it to mid-late without getting fat. Well, leave me a. Don't congratulate yourself. Keep watching that waistline. Hear this Josh? You start like, pork and up in that picture. We got on the website. You look a little porky in there. What? Didn't he look a little porky in that picture? I don't think so. A little porky. Half the men and women in the study would made it into well-related adulthood without a weight problem. Ultimately, he became overweight. And a third of those women in court, and then became obese. Not just overweight, but obese. Disgusting. Big fat. Slavs like me, okay? You can't become complacent because you're at risk of becoming overweight. Said, way to the hear this name, Raka Mondrin Vason and associate professor of medicine. I'm obviously investing in the state's late anchor. His first name's got 82 letters in it. Happy Ramadan. Ramadan Vason. He and other researchers studied data gathered from 4,000 white adults. Over 30 years. Not 30 men. Participants were between ages of 30. Not 30 men. 59. The start was amaged every four years. By the end of the study more than one and three had become. You guessed it. All obese. The study defined obesity is a body mass index, which is a commonly used height and weight comparison of more than. Not 30 men. The fact that they just make these numbers up, he's not hurting you. He claimed to drop it, right? The findings published today in the angles of internal medicine. Show obesity may be a greater problem than indicated by studies. They're looking at a cross section of the population at one point in time. These so-called snack shots of obesity, found about 6 and 10 are overweight and 1 and 3 and are obese. The findings also re-emphasize that people must continually watch their weight. Just watch it right now. I'm looking down. Just keep watching. This is a meal. I'm going to waste 5, 16, 18, 18, 18. Push. High-back to my own. I'm so-a-real. Try to play. You can't sit in a large accommodation. So I tell them right away, so I'll sit in the air to take a shower and I'll try to show this to the women. I'll say it's a double dollar store. So I'll tell you, it's a double dollar store.

Miss you you're not following. Yeah, I want to teach you you ever want to teach you a young beautiful thing Yeah, I don't know what if it's on clear whether a 30-so-like era Big speakers to monitor his preaching what agree with his definition of beauty They have time to change their lives got wants to believe the life of crime. He said to and do these missions difficult one reaching after the Men can find with these within these stereotypes on the outskirts of a city know the role of resettili's vibrant fashion capital about 30% of the inmates Mollatei are Muslim officials say that's in a country where Muslims make up just 2% of the population of 58 million in Italy I'll let there's a higher concentration of them in Northern Italy around Milan another good reason not to go to Milan Oh, that's bad don't go to Milan. It's just boring when you go to Italy go to Rome go to Florence. That's it Blown you maybe what about Titi? Oh, I am a new year. I want to go to sit here. Not to chill you You better get what it must be. Titi am I. Yeah, sir. Sit here. You're gonna play this today Chance what they're about the Italians man. They're almost as small as the Jews maybe even a little bit more so I would think I think the Italians are the Schmalsias people on the face of the globe to very well be Many of the Muslim inmates arrived to Italy alone sometimes as young as 14 hoping to find an uncle or cousin even distant relative And burdened with the overly optimistic expectations of their family back in Morocco Tunisia or Algeria You know, it's really interesting, but all over Europe now There's this tremendous Morocco Tunisia Algeria those three countries in Holland in England in Italy Obviously all that are like just pouring in these other countries and we're on the wine why? Because the reproduction like ram it I say Did you see that in Saudi Arabia like over 50% of population is under 15? I did not see it It was small and you know something we're not too happy with those gas prices and on that we have the new Florida law Back-to-fire fat ass governor even though he may not be too happy about the you know the bush relations with he'd been Lonesen the Saudi princes over there. I said we go to Saudi Arabia and Test that you love is what I say What do you think all right and it doubt tested out? Army secretary Noel Harvey and Vice Chief of Staff General Richard Cody Saviest today that the army was using lucid offense department rules they permitted it to sign up more high school dropouts and People who's who are lower on mental qualification test, but they denied this meant it was lowering standards Right all you dropouts out there, you know, I just say no no uncle Sam tell him no chance Not interested in being no human sacrifice come to go nail a chicken on the door and stay Until our recruiters began having real trouble signing up enough army recruits earlier this year The army had said minimum standards that were hired in those that the fence department the army has a recruiting shortfall of 6 to 8,000 soldiers over the past year It hasn't fallen so short of this annual goal since 1979 7 years after to be at now more. I guess when kids were finally washing up for all the kids that the kids had got butcher over there He got sacrificed they started thinking well, maybe that's such a good idea Harvey and Cody addressed to me Including issue news conferences doing the annual convention the association the US Army that a permanent offense standards and qualification test call for at least 60% category 1 to 3 the high rate of testing and 4% category for the lowest end the other services followed that standard And the army national guard is always followed it as well, but the active army chose to standard to 67% category is 1 through 3 and 2% category for a Adiata. What in other words? I think a long story shot with all these stupid numbers in it If you're breathing if you're breathing if you're breathing if you're done saw us if you're done with a boxer rocks They'll take in of course you have to be dumb to sign up now in sacrifice you're like because you're not fighting for your country anymore You're fighting based on a pack of lies You're fighting so you can go kill a bunch of innocent people and maybe hook up that long American queue those oil fields Which I didn't work it out to well, is it?

I stand together in Apostle February April August Your May Georgia Friday world, and a great boy goes in deep man this is monument want to keep as an end to the According to a 560 WQA, it was a bit of sweet homecoming for United Nations Ambassador John Bolton, former chair of the Conservative Party returned the Yale political union yesterday last night amid a course of hisses and politically charged questions. They were hissing and boon over there. It is addressed which defended the Bush administration's foreign policy. Bolton argued that voluntary contributions from states would allow major donor such as the U.S. to choose to fund the UN programs that they believe to be the most efficient. But while fielding questions from impassions students packed in the shipfields, Sterling, Stratkona Hall, Bolton candidly discussed the issues such as nuclear weapons in Iran and North Korea, the war in Iraq and his own confirmation battles. The audience had erupted Bolton throughout his speech with loud banging on desks and hissing. Last about the abuse of Iraq prisoners at Abu Ghara, a Bolton set of the U.S. no other countries or international organizations should hold its own citizens accountable for possible abuse. We don't need anybody else to judge us, he said, we judge our own. The answer prompted loud hissing from the audience, but Bolton offered students a question of his own. This curious does if you are hissing, who do you think will judge better than us, he asked the audience. Most YPU officers including party chairs said they appreciated Bolton's candor and is willing to answer your contentious questions after his prepared address. But a liberal party chair, Kristen Dunham, said she would have preferred a chance for students to respond and they disagreed with his half-assed answers. He was extremely rude, extremely belligerent, everything that Democrats called him in confirmation hearings did, did glicksteen said he was all of those things, all of these, all of these are being treated. They didn't even want to debate. Well there you go, that's the already stressed from a bunch of this four punks up there, right? Much of Brad. 965 votes on air.

My name is Kipol Rufito. Do you think it was because he didn't do anything when it's back on stock? I can't. I'm sorry. I think he ran this room. Because he was the UMM dumb. It was very damaged from the field. Whichever when he said, and Frano, and like a dumb. Yeah, I know. No, no, I remember that because I saw yesterday the story you said, we come like movies on the country. I don't think I'm smart. I can't be funny. But dumb. I swear I didn't want to spin. Yeah.

I think he was a good guy. I listened to you shows as you know they do. This notion that the period of time was in the basket. Yeah. The notion that these people hate us for our freedom. I just looked over in Canada. Isn't there more Northrooms than here? Oh, and you did. Are you kidding me? And you never hear anything going wrong in Canada because they don't do all the stuff.

Wouldn't that new logo into effect? That would be. I'll be right down. I'll stop off at Buffalo. I'll stop at Everphold's New York. I've got some good gun drops. I would think so. I would like it. By the way, if you're going to Niagara Falls, do not go to Niagara Falls, New York. Who was that? Oh, that was Hank. Remember we had that discussion that morning? Yes. I was going to start with the discussion about the casino Niagara Falls. Couldn't have the biggest sports book, which, by the way, it's not the biggest one in North America. It's the biggest one in Canada. But they couldn't have a sports book because it's the only vaginal annex city. I told them, I'm not talking about Niagara Falls New York. I'm talking about Niagara Falls Ontario. I'm per get with it. Who would go? Only Graham would have an Niagara Falls New York. Seriously, if you were going to like be one of those touristy people, would you go to Niagara Falls? In addition, which the falls on the US side are pretty crappy.

And if he doesn't get married, he can pass it on. I have all that money to let go and have a good time. I'm going to let all the water go to Amsterdam. That's a good time. Sure. Where's Georgia, of course, being the old down. If Georgia didn't have the wife and family, everyone else goes and says, you see a palm, I'd use the palm. And he could have gone to Amsterdam and use the apartment. And I might have even bought your airfare like in the cargo or something. Right. You sent me a couple more of those checks. I'll go to Amsterdam. If I didn't have a wife and family. I wouldn't have to know you better. You better go there together. That'd be a good idea. I guess we can't do that. That would be a good idea. No, I'm serious. It would be a good idea. Have a great time there. I don't know. Well, maybe in about three years. How's that sound? You and you can take a little chicken egg. Vokor brown with you.

Not even to a clock game we're already passing out useless information. We're learning over here. There was a great deal of repression in their lives and the way they were raised and in turn away I was raised. He said. After setting first we invented himself in high school when he was rejected by a girl. He started calling himself heff and where yellow cords, saddle shoes and flammals shirts he wouldn't tuck in instead of what his parents wanted. Later after playboy became successful and reinvented himself again. He started smoking a pipe, bought him or say these and bought the playboy mansion. I became the personification of the prototype that I was describing in the magazine. I became an effect. Mr. Playboy said he quenaces his sister with transformations and said they appear in them. He was elected and from my perspective paid the price for a creative world for myself. He told me a lot of times. There's never to leave.
