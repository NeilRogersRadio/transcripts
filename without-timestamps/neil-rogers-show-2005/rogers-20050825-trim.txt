9.5080 on QA and wrap it up. Can I get to this Marlon's Batboy story? Please. So on a dare from Dodgers pitcher Brad Penny, what a mature guy he is. He-he-he-he wasn't a mom. He dared to Marlon's Batboy to drink a gallon of milk in under an hour and not throw up. Penny offers a Batboy 500 bucks if he could do it. Penny, Penny told to Miami Harold that the boy drank the milk and didn't throw up. But didn't finish the gallon in the allotted time. By the way, once the milk is out for like a 40 minutes I ain't drink it anymore. And the kid gets a 16 suspension from the Marlon's. For doing this on a Y and Brad Penny is a great quote. You get 10 names for steroids and 16s for milk. Where's the laughter? The-the-thank you. I was expecting a little said, wasn't real. He said the matter. He's a good guy. He's a good guy.

Not to see rimmer anymore. He did. They're coming down there. Yeah. He was a good guy. the little stingy just a little stingy in the end otherwise we got yeah big mouth right in that he's a stingy and very train but he's not a bad I if remember so he's been a trader by the way he's the Eric Reed a hockey I just thought I mentioned he's gonna be your counterpart doing the TV yes he's a very nice guy red wing guy and the ESPN guy and he does a good job except he talks to his teeth which I just I can't stand like Eric Reed I'm like our Josh Cortis used to do that and every now and then the last is back in with that talk to his teeth really yeah I never actually called that I never actually called that I didn't realize that money bigger service and a little more carefully I'm trying to do that now I had a lot of a fact I got a fantastic couple of new bits today I thought right as a start which I think you'll enjoy tremendously knowing how much you hate that certainly see what do I always tell you about hate despise that's a very very strong or you file come on yeah oh that's that's fine I got no problem with that come on Kelly one do I will not do it I will not do it do it do it right actually have a nice day I got a swim you would name yourself okay how do you say swims okay try and make it don't play the open no kill it for very very long time they're also reminding people that once the storm passes the careful of standing water it could be filled with and contaminated with bacteria broken glass even hidden power lines there have been tragedies in the past it's maybe the bogey man might be in there too there's Susan candy out he's the only person at CNN we like she's a sweetheart don't we like her lot we do just to go to show you that nothing is perfect on the other side of the screen they got Mrs. Versalimba oh brother look at that bitch are you actually like her a little bit I thought she was okay she never stole her free train I thought she was kind of like a milligmin as I mean the benign that she's tainted now she or tainted not too much wind damage but again too early to say all right you know the same storm expected a short and I'd early tomorrow I mean while at the scum mouths the other the weather guy whatever his name is Chad the Chad Miles he's there he is bad good wonder when it gets like all the sightest hope she's in a building not holding her little he's going to get what you start to find it way yes you know something he's right it is making kind of like a wobble and it could go to the south this one the strangest things ever seen but anyway here's the ideal Katrina slowly getting better organizers moves westward towards southeastern Florida on I never played the wild baffled man okay what I never played the bitch right I think is I want to like get into this I don't because I want to pretend like we have some idea what's going on a hurricane warning remains in effect for the southeastern Florida coast from Viral Beach South where the Florida City including Lake Okotobi where is that Okotobi Okotobi our hurricane warning orders Bob she for whether hurricane report a hurricane warning means that we know that a tropical storm warning remains an effect for the northwest Bahamas is if we care about them hubby and dreary a tropical storm watch remains an effect for each central Florida coast from north of Viral Beach northward to Titusville including all of my right island and for the middle of upper Florida keys from the west asked end of the southern mile bridge northward to the south of Florida City a tropical storm watch is also an effect for the Florida west coast from Florida City to angle would include in Florida Bay a tropical man we know what it means why they always have to say here's what it means like we're a bunch of idiots okay like we haven't been through this 80 million times they know you are very sure certainly not out of this storm you could be on the bad side of the oh yeah that's right you could be on the and any practice morning there we mother advisory in 11 the center of tropical storm Katrina was located in your letter to 26.2 north longitude 79.0 west about 30 miles south south west or free port grand Bahama island about 70 miles east of Fort Lardardale but now it's like two hours later so it's like see there look at that he's still showing all those possible or radar models they can figure out where this thing is loblin maximum sustained winds near 50 miles an hour with higher gusts additional strengthening is possible today and and Katrina could reach category one a week category one hurricane strength before the center reaches the southeast and coastal Florida tropical storm force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from the center and automated observing station at settlement point a grandma home report to sustain winds of 43 miles an hour with a gust of 50 and report on grand Bahama island also report to sustain winds of 43 the estimated minimum central pressure is 999 millibars storm surge flooding a four to six feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected near into the north of where the center makes landfall of Florida storm surge flooding a three to five feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous battering waves can be expected near the center in areas of onshore winds in Bahamas man do with slow forward speed Katrina is expected to boost significant heavy rainfall event over the northwest Bahamas in south Florida with total rainfall accumulations of six to ten inches and isolated maximum amounts isolated 15 inches possible earlier they were saying like 20 inches then they were same 15 now it's six to ten which is still a lot but the no reason to panic you know there was no go out there and start filling up your gas tank and get all that out of shape right at least if you had a vehicle I was operating which is isn't maybe that's an active god maybe got his that that's a way of his protecting your your ass yeah protecting that's what he's doing to be keeping you out of on the monoggy your expensive vehicle involved in the storm like getting all flooded out when in doubt because you know what happens once the car gets water inside of a throw it out okay I don't know how that or so could be an accident in your pants in the car you traded in the next day you do not grab that thing again no matter how well you know there's just no way at least psychologically to get out of there so at any rate I'm looking at that uh... radar and i'll keep an eye peeled on it but i would uh... start doing whatever you're going to do right now which is not like panic you know i'm saying i'm dying whatever uh... things you're going to be doing i would do an accident uh... going to be sooner rather than later okay all the Iraqi parliament will not meet on the constitution today because of the debate that it would put them up and they're to busy a killing each other as a matter of fact in surgeons who mustered back that state they sophisticated and well coordinated strike against police checkpoints yesterday leaving fourteen dead and dozens wounded meanwhile in the southern city of magia fighting between followers of she i cleric mokata al-sada and administrators are five more people dead and ten wounded but that everything is going really well okay all we're far going tremendously well fact to go in so well that more than uh... fifteen hundred peritrippers are headed to a direct temporarily boost military strength during the fall elections the tenagon has announced things are going so well if there's any more because we need to go under control and i had some tremendous planning for all these things and for the civil war that's already going on as i speak i should probably play that note you Oh, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy, boy,

Amsterdam. I wish他 could change 8535. Okay, George's pull from Amsterdam. could change 835 votes which obviously you had a lot more of stuff in the fact that you weren't competent. No, I literally mentioned it like why you had other things going on like a silly asshole we're taking a day I'm not gonna like you're gonna get all our goal for the full of days hundred votes. I would have to change my weight 252 my member size 187. Well I feel better because that was my vote and I had a lot of company obviously. What you're talking about weight right? No. My here 85 my height 77 my address 65 oh oh oh oh oh especially now I'm thinking like oh should wonder how come I'm here you know what a tropical swamp my my Merital status 57 my face 37 my parents 22 my gender 17 I nationality 17 my skin color 10 and my boobs size 9. Hmm that's because we don't have a lot of women's. We forgot age so we said an email saying. A really good that would be excellent. I vote for that. Yeah, I age and member size or just super size sounds good super size. But it's after 10 will keep you posted on what's happening with this whole hurricane and the hazard rights not a hurricane yet but it's headed over those real warm tropical waters you know what I'm saying and it's gonna start picking up steam. I don't know what you're like that. As if you're not used to it okay a lot of rain and some winds not heavy winds though this isn't one of those kind of things. So it's no reason to like extra panic I would put the panic level at about a 4.5 on a scale of 10. Would you say okay I'll say no as opposed to like a man in the sky's falling the world is coming to win kind of thing just calmly by some batteries. That's right by some batteries go out there and get your plywood you don't have to put the plywood up just to drift around on it. Yeah you may float around on it and of course some of the people out there can float already.

Conservative religious broadcast, your Pat Robertson, a Apologize yesterday and I hear he's the best part of this whole Apologies, he's a freaking liar and then later in a broadcast He had like, well, maybe I did say that And he just a liar, you're a crazy person And there's two men in the, uh, Lening's following this Maniac sin in their money Well, you know, that diamond minting didn't work out We were well in Africa and then the gold mining in Library didn't work out to what was buddy Charles Taylor So he's got a, you know, make the big bucks from these And two million old, uh, coots up there, the old coots Conservative religious broadcast, your Pat Robertson, a Apologize for calling for the assassination Then I'll throw him in prison and Hugo Chavez during Mondays broadcast of a 700 club program Is it right to call for assassination? No, and I apologize for that statement, he said in a written statement Earlier, here's the best part, earlier Robbison, of course We've all used to the clip, right? Yeah, yeah, how many times we all see? But first of all, the radio, earlier Robbison said as remarks about Chavez, we're taking out a contest that he never called for the killing of the Latin American leader. I didn't say assassination, I said our special forces should Take him out and take him out can be a number of things, including Kidnapping. There were a number of ways to take on a dictator From power besides killing him. I was misinterpreted by the Associated Press, but that happens all the time, Robbison said On the 700 club. And then, of course, uh, we've all seen the clip And then he had a later retract because somebody said, And he also said, uh, here's the, uh, There's that quote. If he thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think we really ought to go ahead and do it. Do it. So, a whole lot cheaper than starting a war, a assassinate. That was a war. We ought to go into, we have the ability to take him out. And I think that the time has come, that we exercised that ability Robbison said, we don't need another 200 billion dollar Wording, we're going to one strong arm dictator. And so, a whole lot easier to have some of the covert operatives do the job And then get it over with. Take him out, assassinate. Take him out to dinner. Yeah, take him out for a meal. Take him out to a bath in a hot shower and then, uh, And shave it and then still the throat. Man, you, so the poll today is what religious nothing has to do with Hate the most, that's so why we're doing it. Because he's crazy and there are a lot of, you know, There are whole religious things. It's the vein of my existence. The fact that there's so many, including a lot of you folks out there, I know you can't help it because you were brainwashed very, very thoroughly and very well By your parents when you were young and by the, uh, religion Nazis. So you just can't help yourself because they took away that part of your brain, which allows you to realize What a pile of crap at all is it a bunch of man made BS because they simply people are afraid to die. They're afraid to say I'm dying on the hand. And so therefore, whether it's the Muslims or the Jews or the Goyama or whoever it is. Oh, yeah, you're going to like live in heaven. You're going to be up there with God. Are you going to be up there with a virgin's at your right? You're going to be rotting in a box and that's it. So enjoy yourself right now And cut the crap and stop acting like some kind of a See that most people are emotional cripples, you know. Oh, yeah. In fact, I'm thinking of somebody who is in this morning, who's a nice guy, but he's, uh, You're fair and emotional cripple. I was thinking about him when I was shaving this morning. Finn is, I don't want to go one of the details, but I was thinking about, but just emotional cripple, you know. I'm sorry. I had to volume up on the TV. Finn is one of the present in Hugo Chavez. Papi would have poured home offered I yesterday, the two day, the help, Navy Americans would cheap supplies a gas. We want to sell gasoline, the heating fuel directly to Poor communities in the West, the popperlessly to reporters be into visit to communist Run Cuba. Chavez didn't say how then if the way I would go about providing gasoline to Poor communities, then as women state or company, PDVSA on CIPCO, which has 14,000 gas stations in the USA and I guarantee that Pat Robertson A chicken O'CIPCO gas in his thing. The offer may sound attracted to Americans feeling pinched by soaring prices at the pump and not to the US government, which sees Chavez as a left-wing troublemaker of light America. Let's take them out. Gasoline is cheaper than mineral water and oil producing than FW, where consumers can fill their tanks for less than two bucks. Your paying almost three bucks a gallon and they can fill a whole tank for less than two bucks. Ambrage gas prices have risen to 261 a gallon of US. That's for like regular, like low-test, for like half water down. Chavez said that his weather could supply gasoline to Americans at half the price and I'll pay if intermediaries who speculated and exploited consumers were cut out. Then as witness of class Cuba would generously finance or on-premise telecarbons in the nation's foot-to-or-or-oil bills. Chavez incubated a contender graduation of Cuban trained doctors from 20 different countries with seen off of the airport by Cuban president Fidel Castro. Welcome to A-Blood. Watched and secuse the two leaders of being a destabilizing influence in South America so we better take them both out. Chavez and Castro offered a give former conspiracy health care and trained doctor's free of charge. All of those terrible things. Now, guess who were the first ones to sign on to Venezuela's oil plan for the Caribbean after Fidel of course of course. Let me give you a clue, man. Jamaica. Jamaica became the first Caribbean nation to finalize and agreement with Enathaway law on a new plan for the South American nation to supply world to countries throughout the region under the low market terms. Prime Minister PJ Carlisamo, a PGA Patterson, emerged from a private meeting with Venezuela and President of the United States of America. And he wrote Chavez late Tuesday to announce the details of Jamaica's participation in the Petro-Caribbe Initiative and plan to offer oil at flexible terms to 13 Caribbean nations. Under the agreement with Venezuela will provide oil at a discounted rate of $40 a barrel compared with more than 60, it's about 66 and an al-Kast on the world market. How do you like that? So even though Jamaica is mine, they're getting a good deal. I don't want to take it over. I don't want to take it over. Back to it. That's where we're getting an thank you again, Mr. President. Before I forget for those low bargain baseman gas prices, if we could find that pump that call that day, that was like, you know, back during the campaign last year for the presidential election. Or was it maybe it was longer ago than that. Maybe it was right after the Racketack. Right. The illegal amount of Regis and buttress and slaughtering a Racketack based on a pile of lies. I think it was right back then. And it pump calls it, oh thank you Mr. President for the good luck. So, as soon as you of course, we're going to stick our here up to the oil, we'll refine reason and a Racket. Surprise, even their standing online for two, three hours to get gas in a ride because of the fact it's all screwed up. And because the insurgents keep like setting the pipelines on fire all of these, everything. We got to fight them terrorists. Because the country's in the K.I. 27 after 10, so we got the Marlon pre-game in one. No more today. What a good break he catches. So don't don't don't don't don't don't. It looks like the eye of the storm is right off in his house as a matter of fact, right by his place. And you want him to like his God is PO to certain people. Marlon's at the brewer is a 205 pre-game at 130, thank the Lord. Curtis Stevenson follows the baseball game. Hurricane Hotline at 7, what are we? I held an audience for that. Followed by the beast from 9 to 10. Oh, he's still alive and then the 80 Kaplan show tended to. That's our award winning line up here at W.Q. M. and we apologize in advance. That the end of the world is going to come next Tuesday at 430 p.m. March. We'll close in never saying to the Granger. But he's singing now on the hot new CD. Bill Clinton proves his favorite tunes. featuring the former president's versions of classic hits like this one from Pay Floyd. Come in here, dear girl, have a cigar, you're gonna go far. Oh, the way I hope. Till Clinton proves his favorite tunes. Also in Pooot, this great beatle song. Monica Blue and Skies sings over white, but she knows how to act on a date. Yes, he was great. And this, the type party tracks from the pitchwriter on the Detroit wheels. She's the intern with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress, intern with the blue dress on. Wow! Please, till I found the zipper. If you find Liverpool, when the oval office was rocking and nobody bothered knocking, then get your copy of Bill Clinton proves his favorite tunes today. When a history of the human race is written, they'll discover that the USA had impeachment proceedings against the president for lying about his sexual addicts. And we got a president who's got more blood on his hands than Carter's got pills. But it would be pretty good to have a life goes on. It's worth it. It's well worth it because you're a hell. This P-9 business, the project for New American Century is certainly anybody out there with an IQ larger than their thumbnail. You have a life weed up on it, a little bit. I know we've been sunny about that for years, but maybe right now you'd find out that long before there was any 9-11. They already had all these plans to do all these things. All of these things. They need a spray. Yeah. And of course, one of the things that they said in order to get the public to go along with their plans would be to have it kind of like a Pearl Harbor like catastrophe hat. Yeah. You don't mean like 9-11, do you? Well, my God. Wow. And then you write, probably take a call or two today. Now I'm sure that we're not going to get dead use. We're going to get dead use was rain. In fact, I'm looking at that Doppler radar right now. And it's looking like blobby, baby. Bobby said it's looking blobby. All along east coast. Look at that. Another reason not to be in that tropical swamp. Big blob up there by Tom and Oveech. In fact, there's a big blob right over the racetrack right now. Now I guess it would be a bad place to say who it might be because he's no longer with us, but nevertheless, you know, I'm saying what he said. My big blob friend that used to be a pomp and a park all the time. Oh, yeah, that would be sad. Miss him already. Good guy. Big blob over Miami and where you are, it's it's coming. It's coming. It's really. And sooner rather than later, I want to just repeat that again because this business about well overnight, I'm starting ready for like some stuff like old four five six o'clock this afternoon. I mean, what else could I possibly know sitting up here looking out to window with that beautiful sunshine and about 72 degrees right now? What could I possibly know? Where? WKOM. Hello. KOM. Thank you. Yes, sir. That's the first attack on the trade center in 93. They had threatened to come back. Right. We were too busy with penis gay to keep up with these on beat. Mm-hmm. So that's why I just said. How many Q.A.M. hello? Yes. It's an appalli. Okay, Palli, what's up? Two things. We're all like on a technology cutting edge here, but if they would have had this technology back in the 50s and 60s and things, it's just all relative. I mean, I'm in a farming related industry and this is going to whatever happens is going to go back into the golf reform and produce nationwide, the distributors and you know, they're on pins and needles trying to make sure they're going to have product and they don't even know if they're going to have product. But everybody has this top of the radar now. It's just amazing. Yeah. That's 10 years old. I have a friend in the military. He says every 10 years, we released stuff to the, they had this 10 years ago in the government. And we're having this technology now. Thanks for taking the call. Okay. I've ever raped it. I had 10 years ago, but in the meantime, but to be put about, well, they do whatever they want, you know? Your government lies. They cheat. They steal. They rape you. They take your money. They take your property with that imminent domain crap. Whatever the hell they want, they just go ahead and do it. And you're like powerless. And if you want to speak out now, what's upon a time? It could speak out. And if you speak out now, like Cindy, she and then a Schmerium man. It's new Schmerium. They dump all over you. And immediately bring out a bunch of other red. Like the, you know, the Carrie Schmerjard they did. What was one of the call that group, the Zeeboat veteran's group? For a business right wing, a liar. Yeah, they're almost as honest as Pat Robertson. But I quite. Oh, he didn't say anything about assassinate. Line nine. It's always good for a hoot. Q. I am. Hello. Yeah. Like I said, line nine. I think we ought to take off the phone, don't you? Uh huh. That's probably a good idea. Just mention it. Fantastic. WQAM. Hello. It's my birthday. Ha ha ha ha ha. Well, what a shame, huh? I know there was some other reason beside the storm to pull your head down. Being great to smay. WQAM. Hello. Oh. Like I said, there are going to be a lot of good calls today because these people today are saying one thing basically. I have no right. The first couple were all right, like human being. First kind of repeated back to me when I just got to your saying. WQAM. Hello. Can we work between initial compressor? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, I got out and try. Yeah. I think I'm hitting that. Ha ha ha. Now I'm sorry, man. But when you got penny nonson your pants. Ha ha ha. Yeah. You better watch you. You're going to get penny from heaven. Two or three anyway. So I'm looking at that Doppler radar. I'm looking at how he would. I bet you lay tub and how he would is going to be doing much of business today. And you're probably relieved to be able to do it. Because it seems like they don't want to be doing a lot of business. You know what? Get that trying to get all those people to go over there. We those re-reviews about and then we got those fancy just dumping all over them. Which they ought to be pleased about that. That'll be very happy because they don't want to like too much business. They'll be able to find out if they're still making those cheaper goods or never did it. Well, I'll be there. So swim over there today and the fight out for us. 240 votes, which religion is not to you hate the most George W. You've got to watch one. 404. How do you like that? W. Newsphericon 27. Jerry Falwell 26. Pat Robertson 25. Five Lyr, thief, maniac, crook, serious crook, Jesse Jackson 15. James Thompson 11. Jimmy Swagger 10. Al Sharpton 9. The Pope 8. D. James Kennedy 4. Violent. And none of them. I'm religious not. Sullivan, they all know. We got one religious not out there. Hmm. Twenty-before 11 at 5. 50. W. Kuhem. We got that Marlon pre-game at one-third day. All we can say about that is. Oh. Yeah. Although you got lucky on Monday, man, with a pre-game show at 12. 30. And just to show that they don't want to overdo it for you, they pre-game tomorrow as a 12. 145. So you only get a 50 minute of a pre-game. And then Clarence says to me, well, yeah, with all this, of course he was only, he was making a George, but I think he had other things in mind when he was making a... You're crazy. You said it. But, oh, yeah, how about doing a show tomorrow, Neil? Well, you know, in fact, I'll be here nice and dry and out of the harms way, etc. And some of you people won't, you know, you have to like swim to work. And I said, too bad. Yeah. Actually, the answer is... No. Yeah. And he just kept waking it, George, which got George a little bit unsettled. I'm sorry, Pauline. Get ready for the wildest girls gone wild ever. It's girls gone wild. Above girls gone wild. There, there is proof of that shit and so on. Oh! Not a teacher to treat us like sex objects. You've never seen a girl gone wild, but to sure contest like this. And get a spray with his hands. And I'm gonna spray you with butt. Nothing makes girls go wild. Quite like the whole idea behind girls gone wild. Hey, have some time to go on girl action. We're not just Caroline's girl action, right here. To water girls gone wild, above girls gone wild, to call 1-800-SHOW, shut the... Shows you wild. Oh. 1045 is 560, and that would be easy about to say. Yes, something like that. I got to 11 o'clock in advisory. See how my top of this stuff. You know, like always. How many of these things have we been through already? Not 30 minutes. 30,000 of these hurricanes. Another reason to get that out of sound photo while you're still alive. Okay, while you still have a chance while you're still heavy your life. Life and limb and whatever. Right? Right. Between it gradually strengthening is it moose slowly westward across the Florida Straits towards southeast Florida. Oh, my God. A hurricane warning remains an effect for the southeast Florida coast from here will be southward of Florida City, including Lake Okechobee. A tropical storm warning remains an effect in for the Grand Bahama Island, Bimini and the very islands in the northwest Bahamas. The warning has been discontinued for the remainder of the northwest Bahamas. So, you want to swim out there and check the casinos out. The hotel's there are at any rate. A tropical, I don't want to talk about the Bahamas. Everything smells like wet dog. A tropical storm, much remains an effect for the east central Florida coast from north of the Viro Beach, northward to Tattisville, including Allamir at Island and for the middle and upper floor to keys from the west and the southernmost northward to the south of Florida City. A tropical storm also is an effect for the Florida west coast from Florida City to Anglewood, including Florida Bay. And 11 o'clock this morning, the center of the Toronto storm Katrina was located in your latitude 26.2 north Longitude 79.3 west or about 55 miles east of Fort Latterdale. Oh, my God. Katrina is moving toward the west near six miles an hour. It's slow down a little bit, but it's still, uh, keeping along. This general motion is expected to continue with some decrease in forwards feed during the next 24 hours. So there you go, Chad, Fort Myers. See, he's the one that's telling us, oh, it's going to be sooner rather than later, uh, it's slowing down, which is not good because the slower it goes, the more rain it's going to drop, right? Don't like that. On this track, and this is from the National Weather Service, so I trust them more than I trust any jackass on CNN, any long-sack of crap, Chad, Fort Myers or Scott Miles or Brian, or that simple bubble head solely dead. Oh, my God. On this track, the center should be near or over the southeast Florida coast ladders tonight early Friday morning, so I apologize for being influenced by this jackass on the run CNN. Whatever they tend, it's a pack of lies. They suck. We do like Susan Candy, the other net. If like a H bomb fell on CNN and took him all out. Yeah, what did that take him out, right? Right. We would have a party week celebrate. Tropical storm force wind extend outward to 70 miles from the center, automated observing station at settlement point in grandma, and we recently reported to stay at winds of 33 miles an hour. Well, what would we do? What's the big stimulus with that, right? 33 miles an hour? I think that's a shake of coconut. The estimated minimum central pressure is 997 milibars storm surge flooding of two to four feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous, battery waves can be expected near into the north of where the center makes landfall in Florida. Storm surge flooding of two to four feet above normal tide levels along with large and dangerous, battery waves. I'm dying on the air. Can also be expected areas of unsure winds and the Bahamas. Storm surge values will gradually decrease in the Bahamas later today, as this thing blows by. Due to its slow forward speed, Katrina's expected to produce a significant heavy rainfall of energy northwest Bahamas and South Florida. Turtle rainfall accumulations of 60 to 10 inches with isolated maximum amounts of 50 inches are possible. I isolated tornadoes are possible over southern Florida and the Florida Keys. Oh my God. Repeating the 11A in opposition 26.2 north 79.3 west moving near west near 6 miles an hour. And it's said it's over. Next one is at let's see. One o'clock. The next advisor. We'll be right on top of that. I'd like to think on Greg. We'll be right on it. One way? Yeah, let's have it. Do you want to go in? Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes. Hey, no, it's up. Please, Brooklyn Joe. Oh yeah, how you doing, Brooklyn Joe? Good. I was just over by, uh, popping old down. I was driving on power line and I'd bet over there. Now it's the rain and so what's the big semis, right? Yeah, what's the big deal? I love it. I came with her anyway. Yeah, there you go. It's good. Good day to go outside and the stand. Hold on to something electrical. We're going to dig. Grab some of those power wires. Right? Do it. Do it. Put your out of your misery. Oh, speaking of misery, Doug Thompson from the Iran. He's the father and publisher of fantastic. Web site capital hill blue that is George's favorite. Yes. That's and the coward that a great column was on our website. I believe that we put it on for today. Josh. Yes. That's and the coward. That's sure it's right to the point. He doesn't. He doesn't pull any punches. Man, oh, BS. In fact, this is about BS. The man who decided American veterans by hiding out from the Vietnam War and Texas National Guard added and installed the injury this week by shamelessly invoking memories of those who died in a war as a pathetic excuse to continue his illegal and field war in Iraq. Bush's lame attempt to discuss the veterans attending the VW annual convention in Salt Lake City that many of them more BS protect your earmuffs during his speech to the group on Monday. Oh, get your BS protect your earmuffs out. Especially if you have a meeting at QAM. Memo to the dimwood now living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue when the vets will actually foster their country stop buying your bullshmid during a lot of trouble. Truth is veterans especially those who served in Vietnam have long this trusted W. They know he hit out from the war using his daddy's connections to get bumped to the head of the line to get in the air. The Texas Air National Guard to avoid serving in Southeast Asia. They've seen the enlistment documents where he opted out of overseas service and extra step to make sure he stayed state side during the war. Real veterans can smell a coward and Bush stinks like a dead rotting carcass. Yellow threw in through a cardboard. Yellow threw in through a cardboard cowboy who can sign an executive order setting a mercenaries and women to their deaths in Iraq. But one who didn't have the courage to stand up and fight for his country when he had a chance. Many vets joined in the patriotic server that followed the 911 terrorist attacks and supported our military action to Afghanistan. They tried to bring out kind of leader Osama bin Laden to justice. Some back the invasive Iraq choosing to leave Bush's justification for war. Justifications are turned out to be manufactured evidence and outright lies. Now more and more vets see Bush for what he is a line sniveling coward who doesn't deserve to be called commander in chief. They see a man who sent Americans to die in a war based on false pretenses. And now has the goal to try to invoke the memories of real heroes to try and rationalize his illegality immorality in cowardice. They don't buy it. Why should they? They serve their country in a war. He didn't. He had out like a spoiled little rich kid afraid to stand up and face the enemy. Ironically and sadly the coward who used the National Guard to avoid service and conflict is now the present who sends a reserve in guard units to fight and die in his own dirty little war. The veterans know Bush sold out this nation. It's honorable and significant by invading a country that posed no immediate threat to this nation. And waiting for war that didn't need to be fought. They know the blood of more than 1800 Americans 1874 by the way. More than 1800 Americans forever stains the hands of a coward named Bush and every fool who supports him in his war. They also see Bush as the president who cut their benefits reduced their cost of living allowances and centrufs in a battle without proper equipment armor or safeguards. The veterans who served their country have no use for someone who did not. They have no use for George W. Bush. They're like that. I was at message from Mark. That's right. That's the accurate percentage by the way. You know, a human child is not only has he got a 70% approval rating, but he got 70% percent of the votes in the election and then. And then the best part of that is that the right winger is so saying, Oh, yeah, but that was a fixed election. And believe you may have anybody knows about fixed elections. They're the ones. They're the expert. They had the expert T's. God forbid we should have our fixed fixed election in the USA. Mark says today George Bush is approval rating is a 46% I saw 38% the pull we had under the other day. It wasn't a judge. 38% I don't remember. Yes. Through approval through approval. Post of Venezuela. Hugo Chavez is a 70% anyway. We can make a trade. We'll even throw in Dictane and Proud Alisa to sweeten the deal. I say it sounds like a match made in heaven. We get those low gas prices too. What do you say? Let's get you a Chavez in their right away. Or at least Caesar Chavez gets some cheap lettuce. What? Oh, look at that statement Robertson says, Quote, is it right to call for assassination? No. I apologize for that statement. I've spoken frustration. I ain't pounding you. I ain't getting any statement. How can they have always silly broads on your reading the newsman? It's embarrassing. She got about as much credibility, especially since he married that Lard has to pop in right wing hypocritical phony. That Dr. Shaphing piece of turd. They're in King and my ass. So you got to 11 o'clock advice. We did a lot of rain and a little bit of wind and 33 miles an hour. That one of the gusts there. Where was it in somewhere in the Bahamas? And of course, guys try to blow them off the face of the map and I don't blame him. What do you say? In fact, if he was smart, he would take them out too. Like Pat Robertson says, when it does, just take them out. And starting October 1st, it's already the 25th of August. Let's hear it. Man, October 1. When it does, take them out and flow it down. Another good reason not to be in that damn state. Oh, man. You look at somebody cross side or like he gave them a look that they don't appreciate. They just blow your crap away anyway. Pat asked Governor says, nice job. Well done. Crazy. Oh, speaking of the war and right wingers. The cross the American Legion, using the VFW are a bunch of old toads. The American Legion, which has 2.7 million members has declared war on anti war protesters. And the media could be next speaking at its National Convention in Honolulu, which Hawaii, by the way, was the first state just passed a bill to put in gas cap prices. Good. A cap on gas. Not on your gas cap, but a cap on gas or whatever. Although, who the hell can afford to live there anyway? If you can afford to live in a while, you don't need a cap on gas prices. I mean, it just costs arm and ten legs. Anyway, speaking at its National Convention in Honolulu, the group's National Commander of the American Legion, California, and the all public protests and media events against the war, even though they're protected by the bill. Whoever heard a such business, these are supposedly the self-proclaimed patriots. Yeah, the American Nazis. Yeah, and all and end well protests. Now, they're just who step along the U.V. The American Legion will stand against anyone in any group that would demoralize our troops or worsens. See, that's always the excuse. All of you are against the war. You demoralizing the troops, right? Maybe that's why 58,000 kids came home and body bags and Vietnam. Our worse endangered their lives by encouraging terrorists to continue their cowardly attacks against freedom-loving peoples. Thomas Catamus, National Commander told delegates that the group's National Convention in Honolulu, the delegates voted to use whatever means necessary to ensure the United backing of the American people to support our troops and the global war on terrorism. They'll take whatever steps our necessary. When a dash of people don't think you are, if you like protests, not pile a crap. Fun sure, see now old coots with a soy-ass camp stay where? Is that the American Legion of the VFW or both? I think they both were. They broke out their own head gear. See, it's the battle of the head gear again. I have always told you. 1057, well, it seems like this show is going to end like we were earlier, like about one-third in the... That's a shame. I'm making part of it. I said a wish. That's what I mean. It'll be one-third in before you know it. Before you can say, I'm dying on the hands. This is the Neil Roger's shell. Let's go to the door door door. This is your plan. What the fuck? Any questions? I feel so man that I can't refrain all my... Let's go meet a big cheger. He's just a pair of lips. We don't train all the time. Let's go meet a big cheger. Don't stop me up. Don't pull me down. Don't pull me down. I could have fun knocking him down the ground. The ground is an old time. Let's go meet a big cheger. He's a little blind man, Megan. Let's go meet a big cheger now. It's a screw. You. Man, hit cheger. He's had better shot up fast. Because if you don't all have to open a big old channel, what pass? Hey, Jenny. Tell me that what pass can't open her? Hey. The stones turn on my side. No they ain't. The stones turn on my side. No they ain't. They say that they don't. Like not for policy. They ain't. I don't know Jack. I play very well and crack. And they play. Not playing talk and crack. How about me? Hey. Did you hear something? If I said one, I figured they're all like in the same vein. So why not like a bunch of them together, right? When it does lump them out? Absolutely. It sounds like a medley. So I'm looking at the short term, the short range loop right now. The radar. Yep. And that's the chat for Myers. Whatever it is, name is on CNN. I went over to MSNBC because CNN is just a forecrap. He's like, he's about as accurate on that as he wasn't at your Friendship that over and the runaway person. He hasn't got any idea what he's talking about. What is sort of the event system? Moving billions of gallons of water in order to create more space. Just in case we get those forecasted by to 10 it. 10 inches with that possible 10 inches of maximum. See, I think that there's a great slogan in my put them on a map. Because every day it caused me to be a teacher and you're going to do it. If you want the MS to win the MSNBC. That's good. That's good. That's good. I think I have to be there for Moton guy. Man, I'm going to be in charge of couldn't do any worse than they're doing already. How many viewers they got? About 30 men. My every cable system in the world. They got about 30 people watching. Pretty sad. For the MS to win the MSNBC. And then of course, then you see some of the people there on the other line. But at least it's a catchy slogan. The eye looks like it's due east of. It's going to say, bokeh, but that would be stress and a little bit. I would say more like deer field pompano. But it doesn't look to me like it's going south. See, is it spinning around? But it is moving very slowly. So it could, in fact, I can be sure that's a weather for us. Got his very well used finger. I'll sharpen up and it's moving that thing. Right into your backyard. Wherever you are, you know, if you're in homestead or if you're in a forward Loddenale or if you're like in Jupiter. He's moving that thing right in your direction. He's going to move that finger right in side your way. I was going to say you're rain is for that. Yes, sure about that. A pen and Joyce. Joyce, she did one hell of a job. Not you're an idiot. Joyce, you are a simpleman. I'm going to tell you one thing. She's taking a bee's leaves down. That Joyce, nice goes. We heart you are in competent. You are useless. I'm starting to roof for the other side, and anyway, there's that. What do you want, right? Now in fact, if you want to go to sun sent me, it was got a pretty good thing on there, although quite frankly, I went to the National Weather Service radar and the shirt reen's loop. Put that thing in motion, baby. click on the loop and watch the loop to loop and see the dark yellow is out there at it. A real bright yellow is right now it's just like I like the guy said. So what's your right in there is if that's an avidian software to the summer time right? And mosquitoes are as big as bowling balls but other than that everything is just fine. Am I correct? Oh we're fine but billionaire television producer John Demoll behind the pioneer show Big Brother will test the limits of ring-out of the TV with the program in which a woman searches for a potential sperm donor can see the child. His new to those Dutch men they are such a much of perverts you know any excuse to put anything sexual on here. I love anything dealing with drugs and sex and drugs perverts can't wait to go back. It's okay it's not what it used to be too many uh there's our people are now too many people from Algeria and Morocco I don't want to let single them out but I will. His new TV station Taupa launched earlier this month-conferred Lera program called I WANT YOUR Child and nothing else. I've had to watch his name Edmund on guiding light will be proud of that. Is he we didn't get uh what's her name's baby? I guess just can't keep the name of that. After all these years huh? Roseberry's baby? Yeah Roseberry's baby. I want your child and nothing else but give no for the details about the show do at 1830 GMT on Wednesday. Well 1830 uh Greg Gennich meantime what does that? That's um I don't know what it is. 130? Oh sorry. You ought to know these things the Brits are uh Gennich meantime I think there's an hour behind the Brits and the Brits are like five hours ahead of us who knows. The plan is that we visit potential donors and of course on camera to side which man is most suitable the 30 year old woman but German will feature in the program said an interview with the telegraph news paper. Oh that's the Dutch paper to telegraph. Check on their website if you want to weather find out how many hours it is going to be raining before you go there. Afterwards there will be artificial insemination said the one who is identified only as Jessica not Jessica but Jessica as in her body to fight that. Oh my god I got a oh where is it? I got a perfect drop in for that from your close personal friend he's probably going to get blown away. Where is it? Those of us. Yeah where's one he does and knows he yes it and he got one doing that? Yes yeah he does. They're in there. He's a boy. He's a boy. He's a boss. He is the best at moment. He's going to drown in Mr. Hurricane and in this storm. Anyway the choice a one off competing with four other reality. What does that mean a one off competing with four other reality TV programs. One of which follows five former prostitutes starting your cafe. The program Alicie the program we see most votes from viewers on Saturday after all these shows available. We turned into a series. But it is just amazing the telegraph also published an email address from an wanting to donate sperm to Jessica. Of course we could find Jessica's picture and put it on our website. We may have some of our listeners out there wanting to donate something. All read a cause we live at the right gets exclusive prison to a video of vendors slewed. We sure missed that tonight on MSNBC. If you want the MSB sure in avoid MSNBC and then by all means of what's seen in the Nazi network they are. I'm not going to call it certainly not news. It's definitely the NN stands for Nazi network. A bunch of suckups. I want to say it again that that crap they had on Sunday night supposedly that probing. You know they're actually having the gold and the question and the president and the silly go word. That was such a wishy washi. Half baked piece of turd man exactly what you'd expect from the suckups at CNN. You people grow man. You're pathetic. You're embarrassing. I'm going with MSNBC from now on from here on out. You stick with CNN there and I'm sticking with MSNBC because I like the MSI. I don't like MS broadcasting. I do like MD MS. You know, kind of a Jews egg. Tileins Prime Minister is trying to fear it out of government minister who allegedly had a penis and largeman procedure saying news of it is affecting the cabinet's reputation on news reports said yesterday. Who did it tell me the Prime Minister told his ministers at a two-day cabinet meeting triggering around a banter and causing some to squirm in their chairs the nation and newspaper be saying. Who done it? Last week a woman being sued for defamation by a clinic after she claimed to give her a face-dispiguring silicone injection said a cabinet member had received a penis enlargement injection at the same clinic and urged him to come forward as a witness in her defense. I wonder if he had a penis disfiguring injection. They said, I only wanted to find out, I guess. Don't figure. Calling on the official through reporters on the steps of government House on to the day the woman said the problem of my face is bigger than the problem of your penis. This is affected the reputation of the cabinet because I wonder if they are Jews a gackie. This is affected the reputation of the cabinet because the news went around the world. I don't want people to think that cabinet members are obsessed with this kind of thing. When the paper quoted the Prime Minister is telling his ministers, speaking to reporters after the meeting, the agriculture minister said no one admitted to the enlargement procedure. Other ministers wrote about various suggestions on how he can be identified. I can't imagine how can you? I don't know. Think about it. MSNBC. I'm telling him. I'm a sheriff. We're not in Scherfism marble. I'm on top of it. Don't forget we have to marlins and other marlins have been too sharp less. They better win today. I'm saying how many games they got left about 45? Yeah, about that. I don't know. I want to put you on a spot. Listen, you should know the record won and lost a percentage. How many games they are of the wild card. You should have this crap too. Two wild cards. Well, that's a piece of cake they can do then and nice weekend. Yeah. To beat Milwaukee. Now let's see where they're about five and a half behind. Yeah, they always seem to lose to the crap teams when they expose. I mean, Milwaukee's not that bad to hear. They're I know. Milwaukee, oh, give me a bra. They're in the wild card race. They're in the wild sealant. They're in the wild card race. They're in the bottom of it. But too bad about the blue jays. Just when they were starting to make a little bit of a move. Now they're making a movement. You can second smell them all away here. They were really on the move. And then they went in Detroit. Not in like lose every day. Just went to a fight. They might have a shot. But they don't pretty good. They're like a mediocre 500 club. What's wrong with that? Pretty much. We'll settle with that. Anyway, let's not get too sports intensive.

Oh you must be turning here. No. And don't forget starting October 1st in Florida. That's right. I was blinker or idiot who had to blink around for like about a mile and a half. They represent a threat to your safety. Or I'm saying it results. Guy and Ask Governor says what in doubt take a mod. Isn't that the new slogan of the right wingers went and down take a mod? To a pass it. I'm doing a good job in a rank by the way. Now here's the facts from somebody who obviously has good intentions. Go to when telecast.com. They've got the best and most accurate radar in surm tracker. Which I already had been there but I thought well I'll just reticulate just to see if he's right. And guess what? I would say. No. The best or right are for what I'm looking for. Here the short range loop is the National Weather Service radar. Yeah. Don't you agree? Do. The short range loop. I mean it shows it out. Well as far as you want it to like Bahamas and whatever. And there it is. And it's raining. And case you had notice. It's raining over there. Here's the M.S.D.M. It's not only Florida but for the rest of the Southeast as it makes its way across the peninsula and then eventually back up in two portions of the Panhandle. So be a long day. We'll be right here with you each and every half hour. Excellent. We want the M.S.D.M.S.D.M.S.D. That's right. They are so pathetic man. You know you saw that really caused me. How can she? Yeah. I don't know. Does she look good? No. Can she speak? No. Is she got a voice? Not a great voice. Is she got any voice? No. Is she penetrating? No. I don't want to go to that. But I mean what is that? What is it? So she was on Fox News. Right away because she they don't understand one thing and that is that people are watching Fox for the other than O'Reilly who's a phenomenon. You know? I'm TV. Not on radio. Radio is still got that point. Oh. But uh but other than that they watch Fox because it's Fox because it's a religion. It's not a news outlet. It's a religious channel. It's a right wing fundamentalist Bible thumping. We hate everybody channel. Let's Fox News. So whatever they got on there is got a number. I mean if Greta's got a big number what does that tell you? I mean she is just I've had bomb movements that were more attractive than Greta. She just wrote a text. She takes a picture of that. She's got a nasty an she sounds like a water not she's got a nasty gravel evoice. I'm sorry but he's right Wringers man. He can't complain about their IQ or their taste because they have neither neither. They just idiots. That occurs is why they like certain obbugar or other illiterate the group balls. Dangerous ones though. I'm not saying something to be a little bit in uh group ball. That's okay but when you're a dangerous one and people are dying as a result. Oh here's some other group ball. Oh it's Miss Mark Potter. Going to go out. Shelters are also opening. Hey Mark, this is our fair in anticipation of the storm. I'm making landfall somewhere in this area later today. Again no one here is panic him. They are veterans of much bigger storm. I'm not going to die. They're watching it closely. Again they're just shamed about the flooding and residents here are just being asked to watch the news. Watch the weather cast. Yeah, once they know where the worst of this storm is hitting and at what strength later today. Back to you. All right Mark, we're from Potter reporting there. You can get the latest on tropical storm Katrina by logging onto our website at MSNBC.com. Excellent. Get the MS from MSNBC.com baby. She's really ugly too. You know, that's fine. I'm ugly but I'm not on television and was once upon a time boy I'm still embarrassed about that thing. Thanks a lot Marvin. You idiot. You quizzing. You are simple then. You're fairy. So I'm watching that thing and like I said it's just I don't know. I think perhaps that some people are making a little bit more of this than need be like like the weather hysterical people. The weather carries. That's their job. I mean you know I see the thing is swirling out there and it's got a lot of rain and the big stimulus video. 5 6 7 0 5 60 time. Maybe there's some other people out there who are I'm looking at all. I like the other guy said he's a draven and pomp and a beach right now and his little rain coming down and we're not talking about jaggedy and it tremendous winds here. We're not talking about the end of the work. We're not talking about trees being uprooted or you know your dog being sent flying in outer space. Just it's a storm. That's all. That may be like a very very mild bargain basement hurricane category while very weak category one at best by the time it hits your and blows you all away. You know that's all. We can all have said about it. I'm just sitting here very calm cool and directed looking out my window looking at the very sunny sky. What's the temperature in Toronto right now for a podcast with over home sure is listening. It's 22 Celsius 72 Fahrenheit. A guy hi to the sunny no clouds no rain on a sunny in 26 that's 70 9 last time. I like it for a night. There's Eric Lindrasso the maple leaves. Get with it Eric. Okay cut the crap.

And I was like keep sucking up to him because he's got to be there with him. We've got to see him every day. Right. And I mean he's going to be up there in that press box all the time doing those Panther games on the radio. The guilty might say. I think he's going to do okay. I guarantee you won't be boring like some of the other sports cases we've got in town. I'm not to mention Dave Van or that rich wall sky and TV. Whoever has naked pictures of Jim Sarnie with a Billy goat. You've got to be kidding me. Or maybe a naked pictures of Jim Sarnie with Billy Martin. I don't know what it is. But there's something there. Talk about a suckup. What's that all about? God comes in at town as a horse ball job is totally a see it's like Jimmy Siffle is in which walls I put him pretty much in the same category. Not ready for prime time. Unqualified is what they are in experience to just totally unqualified. So Josh wants to take the rest of the show to where we're finnised on Jimmy's cell phone and Joe Rose. I like Joe. No, I know he like him personal. He's doing a good job on the games. That's good. No, he wasn't. But he he he could be okay. It's a work in progress. Are you starting with a crap to? Exactly. A work in progress. Well, you must be Joe. I don't know. Joe I think can get that. I like Joe. Well, not Joe Rose is a great guy and he's an excellent broadcaster but he's certainly no mad dog. Oh, no. He's worked and we're working with a guy that's totally unqualified and just Jimmy and Joe and Joe and Jim and are talking back and forth to each other and not doing the description of the game which is what you said. That's when I listened for the 15 minutes. It was a yeah. And a step in a whole year. The reason he's not to play by plays because Jimmy is not a play by play guy. Okay. He may be playing a little bit. He's not to do them play by play on the radio or off. Oh, I know. So we're pretty upset about it. Jimmy. Okay. Those dolphins out there who miss Rick Weaver. So desperately and even Bill Zimfer was pretty good. Good guys in for good guy. Got screwed badly when somebody can go. They must have done my stir. So I told you, I'd miss him. They're doing for a motor car. Yeah. Seriously, they're on speaking of them all yesterday. So George leading into the motion being the back to that you are. Yeah. He like had like about a minute.

A judge on Wednesday in Pittsburgh. Ordered a school district to read mid 14 year old student expelled for writing violent profane rap lyrics, finding that his songs did not amount to two threats against the school, and so were protected by the first amendment. The Riverside Beaver County School District kicked out Anthony Latour because officials believe his lowest constitution threats to shoot up the school and other student. The ACIU representing with two or three in the songs were battle rap. A music genre in which two people try to out-rim each other often using violent putdowns. Battle rap. Yeah, you know, you spit. Mine? That'll rap. Yeah, they rap off. You guys, I heard that Moe was going to be one of those, but it was a rap off. It's when I heard. You guys, this week judge, John Edda and Rose overturned his expulsion issue. They preliminary injunction against sort of a military commitment. It looked toward the 9th grade when classes resumed August 31. That's less than a week. That's a week from yesterday. In one song with two a wrote, so watch what you say about me. I'm everywhere, son, and the word of moth is that I'm carrying guns. Now that I'm coming for you, what the FU going to do, come to level with a pump tons of slugs that will punish you. How do you like that? School officials learned of Latour's writings in March and contacted the police who charged him with terrorist threats to harassment. Latour was expelled and made the charges are pending. Terrorist threats and harassment. How do you like that? He's just rapping at baby. The judge said the school's argument that the music was threatening was weakened because school officials did not take immediate steps to investigate the music, such as searching with Troor's locker or contacting his parents for the more. And Rose said school officials didn't present any evidence that the songs disrupted the school. The school district and the Troor's family did not have any comments. How do you like that? He just rapping at me. He's doing a little work on a rap. Is it battle? It's a lot of much of graphic history, a bunch of battle rap. That's what it is. Just playing dance, take them all out. Now this is a story that obviously nobody cares about because we had in our our website. I think it was the least read. Actually it was about the states. I don't think I even saved that story because nobody cared about it. About the fastest states. Did you know the Houston is the fastest city in the country? I did not. And the Texas has got like four, the worst ten fastest city. That's because they meet all the embobicued on there. You know, they're all like Texas B for whatever they're doing. They're just sitting around on their fat ass. Kind of like your president is doing sit around on this fat ass and Texas and Texas is an Idaho while Roman is burning you know and the middle east too. Oh, basically rates rose last year and every state we're getting fat and fat. I lost two pounds by the way. Good. One ninety three. It's not good, but I was starting to get a little on the precipice of being over my plane. I'm not joking about that. I get like over one ninety five. I can't function as a quasi human being. I can't even do this show. I can't even just it's a function of the diabetes thing. But now I'm like, you see, you notice the difference I sound like almost like myself today. I'll be quite as, huh? I'll be almost at a day over ninety. Hey, by the way, it's QAM or old obesity rates rose last year and every state that over I got a corner when advocacy group that come on the government and the five of it's going to get more involved in America's battle with expanding waste lines. The advocacy group all by the way, I wonder how I'll keep two or Kevin Chuto is doing. Don't buy that book, please. I sure hope a lot of people read that story. Please don't buy that book. Don't waste your thirty dollars. Oh my god, the number of things you could like get a half a taking gas for thirty bucks. The advocacy and what do you say? The group press for American self said data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that the percentage of obese adults for 2002 to four is student 22 point. Now it's over twenty five percent. Ready for that? I'm ready. obese. Not just that. I mean fat like 60 percent. Throbees. Obest. The state of civilian largest increase in obesity was Alabama. Maybe they sort of abandon their knee. There is a rate increase to point and a half to twenty seven point seven percent. Oregon's rate helps study at twenty one. Reports of the states for the highest percentage of obese adults are Mississippi, Alabama, West Virginia, Louisiana and Tennessee. The states for the lowest percentage of obese adults are Colorado. Is it that outdoorsy kind of thing there? Is it that there are spent all day running around shooting them Fagots. Nice to walk outside. And you have to choose it? Oh yeah, Massachusetts man. They run off and down a beacon street. Rhode Island, Connecticut, Vermont and Montana. Hawaii was on Clinton report. Of course I say, didn't Hawaii that have to include all those sumo kind of guys. I love it. Hawaii is there like that. What are they? Fat. Fat. You know what I'm saying? Right. It's not what it was. And they do that pig roast where they put the pig on the spit. Sometimes they make a mistake. It's another one of those things like the eskimos. As long as they kept to the native diet, it didn't get so crazy. Yeah. And we poisoned them with our refined every day. They got some really great. That's a lot of good food and a lot of good food. Yeah. And if we saw what they trust America's health said, the US is stuck in a debate Limbo about how the government should confront obesity. First of all, how about if they went after all the food manufacturers that putting all this crap to addicted to make you addicted to their food and all the crappiness making you fat. How about that? But that's bad for business. So they're not going to do that. If you're smoking those cancer sticks, then right away, oh, it's bad. It's going to kill you. And we're going to sue you all. You know, all these multi-million dollar lawsuits. I just don't understand what I'm not like to. Oh, there's that chant ever again. This would be a huge storm getting Florida. It's not a huge storm. It is going to be probably a category one as it makes landfall. It is still traveling off to the west. That's about seven or eight miles per hour. Now you do this ass. Here's a northern part of the Iowa. The most dangerous part of any storm, especially when this convection here, rotates up and around and it's on this side. And as is still a moves toward bulk up. I thought you had bulk of Amy on over. It's going to be a long time. It's going to be a long time. That's not what it's going to be. It's not going to be a long time. Kill the developing. Right now, officially it's 60 miles per hour. There may be some higher gusts, especially in this squal right here, which will rotate. And then you have to squal it over. Right between the line between Barfard County, Barbarard County, and into Palm Beach County. That's where the strongest part of this storm is going to hit. Probably 75, maybe 80 miles per hour when it makes landfall. And there you go, bokeh. There's an like I told you it's not moving south and spread out what this bubble head on CNN said there's been saying all morning long and it's not going to the south. It's going west if anything. It may go a little tiny bit to understand. Right straight in the bokeh right in the most house. This is a million dollars. This is 5. 16. We can put this door. Hey, I'm from out. You may have a rush. And I like scrubbing my snowy gorilla house with soap made from jewels. And listening to the new roke, I'm going to use the hour. See guys, we're all going to see here. I ain't never said no. Yeah, there's a car in the noise. We can put the door in the door. The mouth keeps saying, the noise. I ain't never said it. I'm not going to. The thing is, it's a bit of a noise.

J. and reverse claimed by the American film Institute is one of the hundred greatest U.S. films at the last century mockingbird won three Oscars including one first-door Gregory Schmeck who died in 2003 and it was Peter's read the ulogy of pex funeral in art there is compassion and compassion there is humanity and humanity there's generosity and love Peter said Gregory Peck gave us these attributes and full measure net touching of touch of no over the years Peter's was regular on the mockingbird circuit appearing on stage with Mary Bannon who played Scott or is that bad ham kind of like Cindy she hen who played young scout in the movie and most recently at a 2005 L. tribute to Harper Lee upon who's novel they largely faithful film was played well it's a shame it was a good actor

your map pole because he uh is reasonably effective me directly man in my kid's school so I want to get him in the pole don't forget choose life man and we're seeing and meet as our so-called president is that I do the president has a lot of power you know but when he changed the second commandment from doubt shall not kill to doubt shall kill anybody as a boy would I believe and kill only ragdays that's what I'm saying I mean he's pretty relieved it's so much like you know what about love by enemy you know choose life baby okay much a hypocrite says that just like Pat Robertson there's and you know what's the way he gets a free pass from the media I really scoured to try to find some re-scaving editorials and commentator and a couple articles I put on the website but there just wasn't a lot here's a guy who comes on the air on his own TV channel there and is a 700 club and advocates the assassination of a duly elected leader of another country where we already had these very grotesque relations with and a very delicate oil situation and opens up a month and says yeah let's kill a months and I wait anymore let's get over with the assassinated now and then goes on and lies about it and a half-paked a lukewarm apology to a word of war as if like whooping that's right we got to say that 200 bit in but you know lives that's not important he didn't mention that the 187- 74 dead kids in Iraq he didn't talk about that he's talking about some money and of course because that that he's a money grab in a horror and crook is what he is if you want to if you if you google Pat Robertson crook just put his name in the word crook next to it then you'll find out all about him and his exploits in Africa in Zayir and in Liberia all of the time in mines and the phony operation rescue and all this aid they were saying in the pilot said they weren't bringing any aid at all that we're doing was like bringing materials over to so they could do their diamond mining and by the way the good news is that all went went to pot so to speak well good went to Alan Hancock casket miserable crook it's drool and the thing that he ran for prison I think it's mighty appropriate given

I'm money you're making $80 dollars I can lose that in about five seconds it would buy it But the fact that it matter is I found it right you know what's saying sure Well what's the point? So I stuffed it in my pocket and I came up first there And I kind of little smirk a lot of my face why what does it make right? I'm just keepers. Now that's right. Finders keepers. Those are the weepers. Yadi Adi. Amama. That's right my 80 bucks didn't change my life and hopefully it's not gonna Anybody can afford to live in this building is not gonna change their life either 80 bucks Canadian chicken feed I'm just one of those things.

I cash in a bank and I go to the bay and the dim and the flagship bank on Was it Washington Avenue or all-in-road whatever ever was a flagship dinner longer in business And I go to take money out and then come to find out that the the ATM was broken Which back to those days that were kind of on the primitive side anyway and it were like all over the place and without a service Then I could get no cash so I had like I don't know I made like two bucks in my pocket So I'm walking back to my little apartment where the orthodox Jews who lived upstairs used to like hockey shining till three Marm.

Here's the water clock advisory on top of a storm Katrina And intermediate advisory number eight a one to have like a letter after number eight a I don't know I don't either but it says Katrina continues to strengthen as it moves slowly westward across the Florida Straits towards south east Florida A hurricane warning remains in effect for these southeast Florida coast from 0B South order Florida Florida City including Lake Oca Chobie A� storm warning remains in effect for Grand Bahama Island limiting the very islands in the northwest Bahamas The warning has been discontinued for the remainder of the northwest Bahamas a tropical storm Lockerings and effect for the east central Florida coast from north of your obese northward to Tattisville including all of Merit Island And for the middle and upper floor to keys from the west end the ass ended the 7 mile bridge northward to south of Florida City A tropical storm marches also in effect for the Florida west coast from Florida City to Anglewood including Florida Bay For our LSE and one o'clock reports from Noah Dopber radar and a newer reconnaissance aircraft indicates a center of Proper storm Katrina was located near latitude 26.2 north and longitudinal 79.5 west or about 40 miles east north east of four Loderdale and about 40 miles east south east of Voka Voka Voka Vota do do do do do doy Katrina's moving toward the west near six miles an hour I you know I just want to interject it looks to me like a little jog that the north west I could be wrong about that but I don't think so, but they say and who the how am I right to doubt them right now? It's a little anyway Moving toward the west near six miles an hour this general larceness expected continue with a slight decrease in forward speed during the next 24 hours On this track the center should be near or over the southeast Florida coast later tonight or early Friday morning How is that possible? Probably Friday morning. Or maybe the mean like one or two in the morning. Oh, they're wrong Reports from a network of reconnaissance aircraft indicate maximum assistant wins have increased in here 65 miles an hour with higher gusts additional strengthening is expected today and tonight and Katrina could become a category one hurricane Before the center reaches these southeast and coast of Florida And I'm looking at those bands.
