Yeah, so Tom jika got an email from great view del Tom jika yeah, I mean is that the same Tom jika that's early rotten hell? Yeah, before I threw him off the roof. Yeah, he's uh, I got it out of him and he said to tell you that they do del Set him an email he's in Birmingham, Alabama good place for him and he wrote that he's doing very well There in fact he has groupies called braggies And he's looking for it to the day when you retire so he can come here and take over oh Yeah, that's what he wrote Tom I guess he's still gonna take it all same pills And Ed Caplin will be 61 60 in two weeks Excellent, I would can join the club Let's hear it for all Eddie and I do me an old The 60 plus crowds so Eddie and Matt Mo and me and you and wow old Jews old Jews Kicking Joel find versus ass. That's the good news speaking a dick fine bird in pompot o park They're gonna be reopening for simultaneous December 17 Library seen December the second I've got about 17 different facts is here. Oh, and I say told you a couple weeks ago They're getting very close to the agreement with call there and gallstream or call there will take the galls they will take each other's signal Yeah, for Simon you don't have to go to gulfs me when you want to freeze your ass off. That's right And stand behind all those old yentas while you know there for two races that I'm doing for ABC other than that They won't find a bigger thing in gulf stream is the old yentas who take the racing for when they spread it out There's a minute to post under loading the horses in the gate and they're at the window and they're at the window And they're putting their profile for their racing form open and lean and hunched over I'm fitting out with you by the way Fetting with equally old yentas who would be like a window Exactly, well, I had a mess on 95 this one by the way. Did Josh ever show up George or not? Nope Josh out there yet Josh court. This is near because there's a mess on on any five that a fatal answer Oh, Josh or Joshua sir. There was not there because huh and we're Joshua today Parents there was not there because he's he can't make up his mind He wants to be programmed director, which is kind of silly in the first place or a ums sports nerd So he chose ums sports nerd isn't Seattle for that big basketball game um and air force tonight. That's a big good. Yep, whenever humongous two and audience for their club How about those old is patriots man? That was a gutsy performance yesterday Fire inches up in the wild blue yonder don't ignore me about those patriots. I'm not ignoring you That's why we may see performances the game went on It could more and more injuries in it. They still pulled up their bootstraps and jackstraps and kick the ass and what accounted? You can have rated a ball with two minutes or less remaining in your in deep trouble. Oh, yeah He only went 74 yards in two plays the only thing I think that I know you can't second guess winning And he can't second guess build village check, but I think they made him a stake there in the end What was that instead of killing the clock there when he had to ball in certain You know the score was 16 15 Miami and he got the ball down there. We'd like about a little over two minutes to go Why not kill a clock off and you know and just run the ball I believe in that you know when you have a chance to score you have a score there be fine in the game What if they bumble what if they crumble while the killing and I think that's true. That's a good point What about if the past little bit intercepted that one happening against the dog Get two interceptions of the game. I know okay, but no, those those were two you know great throws and Actually the guy had pretty good coverage on the one to Tim Dwight. He just didn't make you know Dwight's just not to play to get out of his hands Yeah, I have a lot. Yeah, well the dolphins are three and six night God We didn't pay them for and I have my dollars to cure their games this year boy We'd be in deep stuff. Yeah, there are a lot of bad reports about Jimmy syphilis I'm here and he just can't cut it. I don't know I haven't heard their bro's unqualified in the first place can't cut it I heard all these doing a nice job on a panther game. That's what I've been saying I think he's gonna find you have two by the panthers aren't doing see the panthers They got this new deal that is every game in less 10 seconds. They blow the game Irbic game now, and I just want to lie respect boy I'll tell you the three point two seconds left in the flyer game and they're sure and they got a power play That's gonna carry over to overtime. They're gonna have a four on three for a minute overtime and Instead they cough it up and but a big it's in the net. That was that was tragic. That was pathetic So anyways, you know you happy like came through all this information that was excellent That was a great job. I could tell you a little bit about my weekend of woodbind. Yeah, I want to have one of you bucks But I played a wheel of four some machine for 12 hours You'll never believe this and in that 12 hours that machine paid me nine thousand dollars wow We're not would say any of what it cost me for nine thousand eight thousand nine 590 that's not so I finally said to help with this crap because it was a hot machine Mine but it kept taking it all back so they got some new game which when I go Wednesday I have to see what the name of this new game is a new machine and I thought well I'd seen a couple when four grand on it earlier was right behind where I was planned I thought well, it's maybe it's a hot machine and I sat down and of course when you get to a new You're not a slump guy boy. You get to a new machine. You have no idea what they're doing and it also does a free spin thing like we're the fortune But and it's got a big thing up on the top and they they the voice come the else out Whatever you when you hit to spin 30 dollars under that way. We got so I hit the button a thousand dollars.

He was on there. Ken Melman was on here lying through his teeth I was on him first by everybody to be honest with him. I mean yesterday was NFL Sunday was the Patriots and Adolphins Ooh, but tell us more important and Josh's Tampa Bay bucket ears won he's an area. There's no podium And throwing game over to Redskins 36 35 What did that was yesterday actually a couple of pretty good boggies the Patriots stopping him sucked to the fourth quarter and then it was like made it all worthwhile I was going Tom baby and I was doll fans man. Oh boy. They got to be hanging in her head They were all whipped up into a frenzy there when they had to leave for about 40 seconds and then that was the end of that Anyway, here's the ideal pop at a park race track damage by Hurricane Wilma will reopen November 17 for some of cancer racing My close personal friend GM Dick Finder said no relation to Joel find where you want to make sure you know that and live racing resumes December the tooth December two after Assessing and it says here after accessing that's got to be a misprint by the idiots at the South Florida business journal You morons you quizlings. I think what Dick means is assessing all the repairs of the lead to the reopening of facility from the damage caused by Wilma We're happy to announce that we should be able to reopen ahead of schedule for all you people just dying the plunger guts out Pomp and a park server considerable damage to the second 34th floors in the poker room also damage was the tote board The race padlock and more than 10 bars in the back stretch that'll have to be replaced I guess I guess that blows my plans there for the fat rich memorial barn Maybe they could build it now. Yeah, they're just gonna put the horses ass in that one Hey, where to you don't take it personal sister joke The outdoor bleach area the drivers room building the also houses the very toughest day of officers judges office The committee officers suffered major damage and most likely have to be torn down Sinal casting will take place only on the third floor in part of the second while when live racing resumes These six floor top of the park restaurant will be open That's excellent just in time for me there when I get there We hope to be able to raise a full schedule when we open a fine verse said provided we have enough horses race four nights a week Monday Wednesday Friday and Saturday just like Apple only has said in the godfather Saturday Tuesday whatever she said Mom, they told you they lied right said it. Hey, don't get into car apple on it too late the most traumatic time in South Florida was there was our second pool on Friday, I'll allow you actually she go back to the first one because you were theory were taking day off going to the beach We don't believe you by going to the beach To a park though video yeah That's the one 16 votes we had a preliminary pool which applies to you on the body washing and what ever gal What a what a pansy and a gal that you forever a cloud on money He's just tragic which applies to you a male I share with soap 3040 we got a lot of work to do in that area I just I don't understand it how can 55% of the guys in his audience still using soap look so visit has say soap is old news Drop the soap Me, I share with body wash with a squeegee one 13 with that my say squeegee can be like a wash cloth Yeah, the scrunchie thing I leave a loophus cry any of those may a device May I share with body wash for no squeegee that for mid 70? They're like they they took the first tender step and other like inching toward using them They're still doing it with their hand. I don't ever bathe 49 of course have been around those people Female I share with body wash 24 female I share with soap 20 so that's about little 50 50 I'll do the making more progress to the men But only 44 out of 616 votes on their net pull over women which shows again We have no female audience whatsoever none zeros if but he do don't none none because it's QAM It's the sports nerd station we're on the wrong station dammit and from what I'm hearing what that sales the problem What's going on there? Mathacher crazy house even worth a usual brother don't just start X and out pictures and that big post We got that thing burn the thing this woman is only two more people have done that anyway I know one of them is all the other ones Todd Rick Yeah, and everybody else including screw in they're all gone how many how many were on there? unto 345 6.789 Better gone one other nine total. I see so seven out of nine. It's like 77 like WAC and let's see a seventh is what 14 percent I'll take your word for it. Yes, so seven out of nine is like a lot No, I'm ninth or the 70 I was right the first time about 78 percent of the sales department gone and now they got like they hired three new people and like They got lost in the way to work and we can't find where they are including the one broad who keeps their cone in sick every day She must have gotten the load down from Adam on his way out. We wish Adam good luck at WIOD. He'll need it working for a cheap go channel anyway Here's the deal on that mock three turbo reason that because Josh is probably listening on the way in getting older It does he's got a little battery and you should by the way give me the wrong information there Josh He said the mock three or Gillette well, and the mock three is does not have the it's the mock three turbo That's the one he was talking about it's all the battery and they're in a vibrate. I think I think Josh What's a pot of time to must have thought his girls instrument his girlfriend's Friend and he's in the things that vibrate now I don't want to see where he like uses that dome, but nevertheless, so he's into the vibran He doesn't use this anyways got a bra on electric razor So how can he be an expert on regular raises but anyway I did buy one and it's pretty good good stuff I said how to have your the your Mr Cuba expert that's all he knows from his fidelity and Cuba that in the meantime He thinks that Maryel was the first one of us to know your few years off. Yeah, like about About 20 anyway anyway McDuffy writes only 94 and the alien saggy 73 prove what I said all along India giving him much to do about nothing. I get everybody who I put that in the same category with the last chicken a rubah Right on right in fact not even that because this wasn't nobody was lost It was just a custody case that's all a personally It was kind of like Terry and her cute nobody else's business, but the family right a medium It is a line ball Miami family nowadays pool. I think is very instructive and Tom Jockish And he did you notice that Hank just didn't even bad in my life I should I don't think he was there to track with Tom just like I told you I know what's going on I don't have to be there for all those signings Although he had a good times autograph. I don't know maybe there was some signing going on there During Wilmo where did you get your best information? 3155.0 so far TV 94 So we have to assume that's the people that never lost power or got power on very early quickly or maybe had battery Operated T-Gloric you like you did right TV audio on radio 83 That's what we had the first day and then we didn't do that no mold because we were able to get on the year and have our people come in and And do a little bit of a public service for change besides giving stupid boss scores So WQM is a very strong respectable third 67 that's almost 19% little Tommy who liked the job we did and thank God for that because I seriously We worked our asses off to try to get some information. I mean Yeah, I said it to talk about it again a little bit too much like we'll work for me. I was exhausted Who we're supporting over hot internet. I don't do that again. I won't QAM 68 internet 59 WI would be 27 now back in the day when we were there when they had a real news department was a real news and talk station They would have won this poll by million miles because everybody would have tuned in with them But nobody does cuz all I got is a bunch of right wing talk shows on and crap Sun Sentinel 12 WDGNO 9 I probably should have put F to yell but I didn't mine a Harold five and the Palm Beach Post filament they own only one got their info from Sun out the newspapers didn't do all that well And newspapers weren't being delivered anyway by the vote by the buy All right, we're most of the people I talked to weren't getting them did you get your newspapers during the night? Yeah, the one I don't want. Yeah, absolutely Well, that I called to tell them to stop delivering and they're still art. Yes. Yeah. Oh boy Some of the worst news in history Robert sheer fired at the LA times That's the sign of our times one of the great comments for like about About 30 minutes if the LA times got fired on Friday as the Nazis start to go and take in a whole thing like this There's a new Rogers This is 5.62 Oh We're buying away Brian Wilson would be up on the stand now Seems he forgot that lot very unusual is it really something can now Well, I'm glad to sad call my attorney and come up with a plan now It'll be no Trying to take time for the way Yeah, the price will fit the bands on blanket to straight now And since he market a smile, no, we'll never take part into base now He is promotional blitz. You're basically one of these I've been in space now It'll be no First time trying to take Brian's profit away 1032 a QA and we had the mole mice to write to this afternoon. May dog three solid hours today for the seven little bonus for you Curtis Stevenson seven to 1030 by the way ducked at a whole new schedule on here aren't you impressed? Man is he doing it away That is really some heavy duty work per case warm-up About 1030 night Clarissa's out there with the beast. I'm assuming is the beast on that trip to I don't know We don't really care and Joseph Gathe of course well, you know what we think Yeah, and so we got hurricane warm up a 1030 from Seattle and then the BCA class it from Seattle whatever that is U.M. and Air Force basketball 11 o'clock tonight, and that's no way to kill me Once they do want to come in like that at that hour especially when he's gonna be 60 years old pretty soon I totally so Who was closest after after all? Because I remember I picked 62 I picked 38 and Josh said 61 so oh you're there now Yeah, yeah, good choice with that mock three turbo razor roll. You probably should have mentioned it Yeah, yeah, because you only said the mock three razor Well, I have a mock three which I don't know what that one does, but it doesn't have a little battery Right, it doesn't yeah, it's not a turbo. I said the mock three vibra. I didn't know you know vibrader Yeah, well, I'm not into buying vibraders like you and you're a lady friend. Okay I mean I'll leave that to you guys. Okay, and what I was gonna say is the reason it's so big is because you've been shaving with disposable razors Right, it's big in his heavy discosal razor And it's like you know, it's so light you don't even know you're holding it and the razor too Yeah, but the mock three turbo is pretty So we used to it and you used to the little vibrate which I don't know I don't need the vibration I mean if you just shave the weight does what that's a vibrating I'd be just fine, you know, but anyway, that's these young punctures You know they rub up against the door frame right away Yeah, you know, you know, they're stuck in all emotional have to change the run-to-worse Right Robert's here. This isn't up to make me change my underwear But at the other end Robert's here was fired Friday from the LA times without explanation replaced by right wing crazy person Jonah Goldberg Oh my god Exactly The LA times in fact I read I was written up on it trying to get more information about it Robert's here Well the great liberal columnist. Oh that's a dirty word for over 30 years now. That newspaper but man and It's just the way things are going on. I read the LA times was doing some phone Tell a marketing business and we're called people up and say well if they if our newspaper was less liberal Would you be subscribed to it? How do you like that? I don't so it's a real subtle move not as everybody See in the far the bizarre part of it is there there behind They don't realize that that's on the way out now is the public finally a little slow on the uptake The public's finally catching on and the polls now show that bush owes points But the big media still owned by them. No, that's correct And the LA times was bought off by some according to one blog note I read the by some right bunch of right wingers So all you're gonna read is fashion's propaganda from now on see better just hang on to us So it probably is good that I'm here. Oh, I do miss those signings. You know what? Don't we have one I told you the first call a first child would be a masculine child And the first call would be a great call do you see that was great. Oh, I'm just those signings Oh, yeah, man probably here's some more bad news Let's get the bad news out of the way then we'll find a good stuff if there was any I doubt it Florida governor fat ass jib bush to brother of our president ruled out running for president in 2008 But kind of like David Cassidy and oh when you do your interviews in Germany The news always gets back you know how David came out of the well kind of your fairy him and he was going all three ways And the German newspaper and then when the article came out in this country I didn't really mean it and I don't speak German and the if being a he's being I'm Berlin or whatever Anyway, but your fan asked governor left open a possibility way subsequently didn't interview with a German magazine published yesterday Fan asked you a Bush was scheduled a visit Germany this week told focus weekly. That's hocus-pocus focus weekly He had not thought much about running for the office held by his father and older brother except to rule out the next election at the end of George W. Bush's second term. He should never say never but for the 2008 election my answer is definitely no He said and comments translated into German by the magazine asked whether isn't it interesting that the bushes are in Germany now How what if they got their hip boots on? They're hit wonder if his wife is like a shoplifting asked whether his answer many later challenge was possibly said Let's say there's a vague chance Bush 52 said he spoke frequently with his brother and visit the White House whenever he wasn't DC But he said the two maybe this guy's family matters or sports I'd be like that Family matters or sports How about those Texas Rangers? How does your doing really good? We need to on it 398 votes on the pool. Let's take a look and see if Tom Tickle was right everybody wanted the TV audio on radio during Wilmo Where'd you get your best information TV? 107 TV audio on radio 95 now? Do we know we don't really know do we? What other stations were like doing their own coverage besides us and I would be maybe FDL and J and I don't know I don't because I'm assuming that most of the FM just opened up the TV audio when you think you think TV audio on radio had 95 but WQM has 74 That's not bad at all.

You're not gonna get it. Don't do it for the rewards just do it because it's the right thing to do That's all it. That's the deal in South Florida.

Ah Okay Just say you know individual thing. I don't know why you say it's easier what's easier about it? Well, why's that easy? No, no, there's no I don't have I'm got a dozen bottles of body wash and there's no No one has got a pump on it. That's hands-sob You're not even buying the right stuff body wash doesn't have a pump something You're not the ones that I'm getting huh?

Have a great day, pal. I'm going to put you up a little bit You know anybody that says it's faster and easier to use soap to take a shower is Dreaming and that's another reason you need either your lufo or leafo or a wash cloth or something Because you I mean what kind of a life is it when we have to instruct the audience and how to take a shower There's something what's wrong with this picture huh? You squeeze your bottle and you learn you amount that you put on there. Okay, with me the lufo Just and just cover the whole surface of it and I close up the bottle put it back on the shelf and at that point You know, you just wet the the lufo before you put the stuff on it so it absorbs it and at that point you got to have to take a So you actually have enough under do two showers right? Let me say the ask for last well the ask you got to do with your hand You don't stick a lufo in your Yeah, okay good guy. Are you crazy? No, maybe you do I don't know Josh this is got that vibrating one a guy was calling about I want to go buy one.

It's not a good idea very bad Especially you like Sally used to say if you can't get it out This is new Rogers This all of this thing you're calling like man My father please This is the new Rogers This is your door You know I told that I can play football for the rest of the season I may put play football player and this is what I do It really hurts me not to be a part of the team I came here to help the game was getting super bowl and win the big game When I got hurt last year You didn't want to say my seeds of over I fall off the food world And everything possibly could risk my car And they have to use when the soap won And I'll say some of the show is a hell my greatest risk I guess I'm talking my greatest So you are father You're a power You can't come back to a war It's the key goal to have you walk with me These idiots so badly but you're added to a war Don't you give a college is terrible Don't tell you it's not a reaction Still they look down on you too All your gunball It's time that you spontaneously to your co-gen team So my echo is angry I owe you enough knowledge We had a lot of wins together and I think even in our respect You have a coach and other person This will away please It's 1100 fine Jesse Jackson's all been on a shape about that big Grandstanding exploitation expert Jesse Jackson will get to that the Reverend Jesse When he's not the word about that love child he's worried about T.O. not Toronto But Terrell owns who used to be Terrell owns I think God punished him for changing the way we pronounce his name don't you?

How positive? Well, like the one they were shown us at that line row of plan Doug Thompson writes my first reaction when I read the transcript of George W. Bush's veterans They speech was anger no not anger rage blind rage how dare he I thought not even the lowest come sucking Son of a bitch in politics would stoop to using a day to one of those who served their country Would stoop to use that day to promote his lies based illegally more lecture size and mass murder Call the invasion to wreck 265 dead by the way three more yesterday. Yes. He would George W. Bush is a pathetic Penillist graph of subhuman trash who lacks any shred of decency or morality So why wouldn't he desecrate the memories of those who serve our nation as a journalist? I'm expected to be dispatched into About events in those who shit them, but I can't be so when it comes to bush He's a liar and a traitor to the Othee's swirl when we came present in the country and we're so hard to destroy Bush is much much more than just a bad present He is a genuinely evil man a raving lunatic who can't face the fact that he's insane politics of politics and Destroyed a one-squake company called America. George Bush is America's an arrogant bully Distressed advice allies hated by most of the rest of the world and divided internally by his divisive duplicitous actions I can no longer regard this maniac with journalists to this passion. I may be a journalist, but I'm an American first And as an American I can't stand silent as a truly evil man destroys the country. I love Polls show most Americans share my distrust of Bush. We all see him for what he is a dishonest Opportunistic political beast who lets nothing stand in the way of his unbridled lust for power He speaks of God of one moment and then calls those who dare to disagree with him mother efforts the next He ends without blinking an ice and more than 2,000 American military men and moving along with countless thousands of Iraqi civilians To their deaths in a senseless invasion based on manufactured evidence and outright lies Then he has the gall to stand up on the day we said the side honor those who served and continue to promote his lies and Call those who see the truth traders away the enemy. Sorry George. Your lies don't play here with the majority majority of Americans It is you who is sold out to your country who is a trader and was committed treason against your office your country and humanity God may one day forgive you for your sins, but I can't neither can the wives the husbands the parents and relatives of those who sent to die for your dirty little war Neither can memories of those who served those we hunted on veterans day and those who's memory you so Calacly dishonored with your propaganda This path on second thought I'm not even sure God can forgive you for what you've done You've lied and you killed in those are sins that even understand you God may have a little trouble for giving If there is justice in the afterlife you'll stand in face that justice for your sins and you may you burn and hell for them Not that he's pissed off for I think you understand me you burn the hell for them Which I said we second that emotion okay?

Even though they were in neighborhoods were all the powers been restored. Our system tells us that everybody's back in who was out. He said, but the system only goes to the neighborhood. It doesn't tell us that a single home might still be out. Most of those are in Broward. How do you like that? It took the part of the storm. Beanster said, if anybody is still out resting with calls, so we can make sure we're not leaving anybody behind. And the number of call is 1-800-4-outage 1-800-4-688-2-443-1-800-4-outage. Call us.

How about Joshua that WWE? Who was it? World wrestling entertainment superstar and World Oak, Gore-Garero. I do, Eddie Garero, yeah, I do. Dead, oh, man. Dead, Marito Garero. I did a werewolf for you, Mr. I'm making fun. Stairroy'd, I guess. The secret off to math, did we go and make an assumption? I don't have to make an assumption. But, found dead as hotel remastered in Mori and Minneapolis where he was scheduled for a pair last night in a WWE Super Show. When Guerrero 38 didn't respond to a wake-up call, hotel security at Minneapolis's Mirriot City Center in Guerrero's nephew. In fellow WWE wrestler, Chobbo Guerrero, forced entry in the room shortly after his 7-inch at the morning. The 5-8-20-pound wrestler was found on the floor attempts to revive him once successful, on the floor as in dead, on the floor and going to see him no more. There were no parents signs to foul play or suicide, police said, and Octopsy was planned that he had been county medical examiner's orifice. He was a featured star on the UPN series, WWE SmackDown, and son of Mexican wrestler, Gorrero. He survived by his wife Vicki and daughter, Showl 14, Showl, is that his in prayer, Showl, Sheryl and 9, and Kaley Marie, three according to, well, what is it with these names? Well, whatever happened to like John and Mary and Tom and Saul and, huh? Well, what's with these names? Well, you know, you got a normal name. Essays A U L is the normal name. Well, never heard that. Chowl? This is a huge loss of WWE chairman of Vince McMahon. And he was a wonderful, far loving human being. He was a consummate performer and Josh Cortez says he was doing Roids' man. He was just 5-8-20-16. Do I, maybe he was a big eater, that's all? Maybe he was just bursing up because he had to play with a big boys. Chobbo Guerrero and McMahon said he was open about his past drug and alcohol abuse, but they said he'd been sober for four years, how do you like that? Guerrero was in the Twin Cities with 60-to-80 other wrestlers to film Friday night's SmackDown at the Target Center. I know how you would want to show to Golan Chobbo, said, and February 2004 Guerrero became the second wrestler of Hispanic heritage to become WWE Champion. Oh, I'm kidding, but. Winning defeated Brock Lesnar for more University of Minnesota wrestling standout. Guerrero lost his title for months later. And made 2004 UPN aired the special cheating death stealing life, the Eddie Guerrero history. I guess that was a little bit of a premature valuation. I would say the allow for Wem Chronicle, these childhoodness struggle with drug addiction and almost cost him his job family in life, before his recovery intervention can't through the WWE Championship, he grew up at El Paso Texas. He and his three-year older brothers were all wrestling wrestlers to a wrestling with it. I didn't like that, huh? Any Guerrero is that even Josh knew who that was, he'd, and if they ever make any Guerrero marry an etc, or puppet, or sock puppet, or sock puppet, or muppet, yeah. You better get him a little bit firmer before you give him that newbie sweet TV, so he knows what we're doing. Drawing a chart, we're going to go over the side between Marianas and puppets and animatronic that. From a little cuckoo friend and Ollie, that's right. Oh, don't forget the dummy, is he? Are we going to get those in there too? Oh, we got plenty of those. You're running the country. 628 votes on a pool during Will, where did you get your best information? TV, 158, TV, audio on radio, 153, that time jickle was all whipped up about. If you're a QAM118, which he obviously was listening to me, because while with a guy like him on a listen to a piece of crap like me, internet 95, WI would be 60, Sun sent me 18, WGNO12, Harold 7, Palm Beach Post 5, and WFTLA 50, which we better put on there is got a big one vote. And that's probably from the first new facet, you know, probably from PD Lenny. No, you're right about adding by the way. Why don't we share best to add them to Ryan who left for it. It was his last day, my mutual agreement, and our sales department. Good guy, but not a good sales guy though. Just too, too low key to. Too nice of a guy. If you're going to be a sales guy, you can't be a nice guy. I can't have a conscience. No, you have to be ruthless and cool-hearted for me. You have to be a real wheeler dealer like a Todd. He's right in here. He'll any slimey, devious, dangerous, you know, like that. A hustler to bustler. Right. Although John Ween is he, I mean, he did some devious things too, but he wasn't, I don't I mean, he wasn't the same. He didn't have the same slime ratio as some of the other guy. No, it was done in different scale. Yeah. And the same with Brian Schmutz. So Brian's, what's his sales manager, some station can edit good. Did we find that on Friday when you were out, I think? Let's have a call. Yeah, about it. But now you know it. This does to embed news. Good news for the right wingers though. They always get their way. They Supreme Court refused to date a review of Florida's lifetime ban on voting rights for convicted felons. A case that would have had natural implications for millions of would be voters. Justices declining her account to Florida's 160-year-old law, which applies to inmates in those of serve time and been released. The ones that are kept from voting in every state except main and Vermont, all the restrictions vary. The issue of voter disenfranchised, make our renewed attention, of course, after the 2000 presidential election grab, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida-ledged. The Florida law was contested in 2009, and we have a people who have already completed their punishments, including probation or parole. Their appeal asked if restrictions can be challenged. On the 1965 voting rights act, which removed various to black voters, one in 10 black Florida adults, half-counting current prisoners, is barred from voting the court was told. The Supreme Court said, ah, ah, one in 10, and of course they don't like you, dark, folks because you tend to vote different credit. So this bunch of Supreme's, and a bunch of Nazis you got wearing the government said, ah, no change, go away. Get lost, dummy up. A lot of pressure today, you know, heavy, heavy, heavy pressure Monday. 560, 50560, pound 560 leave a rise in singular wireless lines. How about those patriots? Yeah, let's hear it. Let's hear it from all these current running phonys out there. Those re-insics, dolphin fans whose team absolutely sucks in bites. So aesthetic, just tragic, what they've done about organization. We've gone from the one state area to the Saban era. And that's, you think that was an improvement? Forget about it. WDQAM, hello. They are you. Good. Uh, quick thing. Uh, generally they use the pivot, is the best thing ever. I've been using it for a few years, and that's not three of the garbage. Use it one in a different, it's not as good as the pivot. Ah, you know. You know, when you're in the man, well, it's the best. Bonnie was you were completely right. I wasn't because I was given a Howard team, but it was true. It's fresh, it was completely totally great. Yeah, so, so far, the first time he's in New Bar of Soap. It's like, uh, that's it. It's sprawled, man. Yeah, it's clear garbage. Listen, I have a listening. I have a listening. Uh, what do you mean? Did you, uh, I totally, I totally, I've got two constant conferences out the old piece of all the other means. We track it. Why? But yeah, you got it on the earth. No, no, no, no, that was the one from today. You're talking about, I'm going to get to that later. That's it's called, uh, where the hell is it? It's on our website. Yeah, that's not the same. It's a little bit of what a 20-degree text, an 16-hundred Pennsylvania Avenue. Let's get a little bit of a meal. Uh, I have a big problem. I think. Yes, I have a lot of problems. Three years to the. That is so bad. No, what the mad is. It is. No, it's not the idea. But the message is great. I'm sorry. Just forget about the acting. I don't want to be over it. It's only a green-back photo. It's taken a copy of the great. Okay, have a great day, Pelle. But while you're head, are they as good as they look? Dada, Dada. Dada. You know, I don't say another guy that doesn't give. He doesn't get to rap. He deserves. And that's Andy Garcia. He's not very good man will be either. Joey. Jazah. You said that's not feeling good. Huh? You used to say the opposite until that Ellie on the counter. No, no, I never said he was going to go. Why did I say what Andy Garcia was doing? Touchables in that movie. We argue about this movie all the time. And that's one of the few things that we have agreed on is that at least his performance was okay. It was okay, but not great. He's, I don't know. He was all right. I mean, he was, he's in shoulders above George Hamilton and Sophia Coppola with a shnise and everybody else. And Eli Wallik. Of course. It was like he was the only one that showed up for work. I mean, you talk about a bad act. Oh, you know what? It got me thinking about all the other Eli Wallik movies that I saw it never read before like the good the bad and the ugly and all the other movies. And I never really noticed just how bad he was. He was horrible. He just brutal. Oh, brutal. He said. Keep on it. Oh, the only you. But like the script in there is so bad on top of it. And then now they're making Michael into a comedian too. You know, for Al Pacino, they're giving him the most lame lines. And Connie is saying Michael, now they will fear you. He said, maybe they should fear you. You know, like we're doing comedy, stick now to God. I'm sorry, comedy don't belong in a God father. There ain't nothing funny. And I said, maybe what's his name? Johnny Olon at Superman. The message, I agree with you was good, but it was the only good thing about that movie. And the message, right? So you see, that's a tremendous service that Francis Ford cop out there because there was a very important message in story in here about the conflict of Vatican Bank and all the corruption in the stalemate and Roberto Calvig and murdered and everything. But it all got covered up because in fact, I'm acting with so bad people couldn't stop thinking about that. Oh, please. First scene of the movie, I think, alone her way would have been much better. And I agree that we needed Robert to narrow. I mean, we needed Tom Hagen, Robert Deva, which I wouldn't give him enough money. It was a mistake. They should tell you why is in Tom Foolish. We need Robert Duval, man. One thing about him, he has made too many bombs. Just about every move. In fact, even the, what that was an input to first time before they changed the name, the great Santini had to remain. Yeah, they had to write the something. But whatever it was, it was released first as with a different name that was a great Santini. And in the movies, they kind of bomb. But it got a call following. It was on people many times. And then we released it and it became a big hit. That was a good movie great Santini was. Robert Duval, we love Robert Duval, baby. Make no mistake about it. Even the way it tends to be a little bit of a religious enough. But that's okay. At least he's not trying to push it on me. Go push it on me, Roberto. You're going to sleep with a fishes. Troll in his pass, no. We got to start started a lot of today, man. We got more Howard David at two. They got that over in the other place. They got mad dog at four to seven. They don't got that. They tried real hard, but they didn't get it. We got Curtis Stevenson sent seven o'clock to 10. 30, three and a half long hours for a young Curtis. 10 30 got your hurricane warm up from Seattle. Big basketball game in the interest of the club. No, you haven't air force at the BCAA class. You can see that 11 o'clock. So whenever the hell it's open. And any case taken in Wells, you're a nice off cause he's an old poot. This is the new Roger. This is five, 16, 16, 16, 16. I don't get how many. Take off. Get any of what? Great fall. Come on. The final frontier. These are the voyages of the scholarship. Enter guns. It's fine. Here, mission room. Two stars, trains. New, special and thin, fabulous places. To seek out new life, silence. And these civil units, two boldly gold, where no man has gone before. Okay, me. Yes, sir. Hi. I've also got course again. Sooner we are not going to Uranus again. We program. Okay, fine. You know fine. I got that. Yes, sooner. Well, I'm not feeling very well. Can you get out your bones? I mean, doctor of bones. Just schedule me another full physical. Herk, bones. Yes, doctor of the... Sooner we say is he isn't feeling very well. No. Could you do another full physical? All this for one, this week, Tamant Jim. I'm a physician. Not a funny boy. Okay, you noticed that we're just putting that far out on that car. Did you see that on CNN? I changed it. I was in France. Oh, for a second there, I thought that was the lime rod. If it were, whatever that thing was in, uh, medley. And it was in France again. We're not only like 300 cars in I said, it's okay. Another column by Doug Thompson. I'm not sure if this is what the guy was referring to. Because he was mumbling in, uh, I don't know what he was talking about. Avoiding the detection of 600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Where he White House aides under constant scrutiny from a paranoid bush administration held by on stopping leaks and turned to a technique used by drug dealers and criminals to avoid detection, pay pay disposable soft phones. The phones which can be purchased for a little 30 bucks a day. I'm sorry to make you. This comes to us off for prepaid minutes. It could be discarded when the time is used up. They require no contractor sign of an hard difficult to trace. It's about the only way we can ensure any privacy one bitter White House staff are told me this week. Our office and home calls are monitored along with our normal soft phones. Enterprising White House staff is a pooled our resources and used third parties to purchase the phones in bulk from retailers like Walmart and small towns outside the national capital region. When one phones minutes are used up, they cost the hands set and activate a new one. Drug dealers and organize games. You search phones to afford wire taps and call monitoring by law enforcement agencies. That White House aides have turned to the same techniques indicates just how tense life is in the West Wing. Every time new story emerges in the press, everyone here comes under suspicions as one aid. We spend most of our time covering our asses instead of tending donations. White House sources tell us that even senior aides like environmental presidential adviser Carl Roe used the prepaid phones to avoid having certain call show up on call logs or other records that my face opinion. You do what you can avoid leaving a paper trail says one aid. Other techniques employed by administration officials to avoid detection include three email accounts through services like hotmail like Oceahu and Gmail, staff members create multiple accounts and create new ones often. Increase to a cast instead of credit cards or debit cards. Gas receipts can show where you've been when you pay cash. There's less of a trail to follow said one staff member. Use of course belonging to friends are increased use of public transportation like the Washington Metro system because it's easier to get lost in a crowd. I know all of this sounds like a dime stir novel, but that's the depth we've all sunk to around here. This is an aid that was worked in previous administration as well as on the current White House staff. One female staffer says working at the White House has gone from the most exciting time of my life to a daily hill. You're always being watched, always on this suspicion, always second guessed. I hate it now. I just wanted to be over. I guess what's we heard? So do all of us to. We wanted to be over. Yeah. Soon. I mean, another year or another how many years it? Oh, geez. Three more years? Holy cow, man. You gotta be kidding me. I don't think we can survive it. Three more years of this. What? What's that to like for my life? Whatever it is. 660, 3 votes and we got 19% time. You take a look at that pool. Now you know something when you really stop and think about it. That's not all that good. I think we wasted our time. Next time we have a big hurricane. I think we'll just really out. Just open up the pot. You smoke it and we'll just play the TV audio owner. Because like Tommy says, then TV people are on top of it. You know, like chef Smith and Anderson Cooper, they're on top of it. No way. We ought to just do that. You know, I mean, why should we come in and floating and pretend we know what's going on? When they're the experts. They got all those guys getting blown away out in the wind and that's rain, hurricane. How many of you can weigh in? Hello. Good afternoon. Good afternoon sir. We're a man. My blood's boiling all morning listening to you. Get me fired up as usual. I appreciate. Listen that disposable phone. Yeah. You know, that's a pretty common thing. And I find it interesting that they're concerned about their email being traced and all that. Because isn't one of their big things. Then going in the libraries and tracing how people are using the computers there. Absolutely. Yes. And the other point I wanted to make was about the. The ladies who complained is a living hell working there. Yeah. Is someone preventing her from resigning and going to work for someone else? I mean, if she gets it's so jably stop whining and, you know, you can get a lot of this right. Get out and get it honest, job. I just hope people are getting agitated enough. That's something it's done. My, my dear old father, we the life one Republican. It's finally starting to get it. But every time these Republicans get into office. Our cost of education grow up. Everything goes up. Yeah. And now he's looking for a hand. I said, well, you better vote Democrat next time because you're not going to get any help. Me city. You know, I said it before both elections unless you are right wing, neoconcinetic or unless you're multi-billionaire either one of those. Nobody in the right mind should have voted for this question. Maybe action. And they did. This guy is even Republican. He's not a Republican. He's a soulless kiddie. And as far as the religious thing, let me let me just close with this. Okay. If you want to teach your children's religion, do it in church, do it at home. I don't want the government teaching anybody religious. It's none of the government's DM business. If you people are too little and can teach your own control. And don't expect the government to do it for you. Amen. I'm Adam material. God bless you. I'll pray for you. Thank you, sir. Yeah. Jimmy Carter, they reran the thing on with King last night, which he's all over the place. Carter, he's a little of a star, but he did say this. Even though he's a Christian, he teaches Sunday school in the on the on the on the. He's very, he's a guest of the really ripply right wing or religion. This is rippman ass. That's going you go Jimmy. He did rippman big fat ass and talk about separation of church and state. All of those things all those old fashioned things like that. And about how this is just grow test with these people. Do how intolerant and hateful there. He later went out there. He stuck it to a masculine Jimmy. He says there they all all white males white males for a hate and full of judgment about everybody else. And preaching hate. It's not too late to preach some hate because it's in now. And it's the impregnable. Great things. It's a good idea. And nobody will be used. Six hundred seventy five votes. We got a shot of seven fifty by the top. The artist means not much. We're not really all at intensive on the votes. It's a Monday. You people got important things to do. Get to roof or get the a screening guy. Get the pool man. Get to treat people to landscape people. The fence guy. All these things. Right. All these things. Right. Blair faces new inquiry to Iraq war impeachment campaign. Ministers will join 200 supporters to force common prob. Oh yes时间 in pitch storm. A fairdown so that would be a really good yeah at the ball roll it and get the balls. Roll it and some kind of press. Twist this guy on sees man pocket. Your weapon. Move in passing. Mm-ho that's okay from your career in material from terrorists. Anything to know where to feel the terrorists. He is inside the United States with a nuclear weapon. the nuclear weapon. The consequences of such an attack would be catastrophic. For our people, for our economy, for our liberties, and probably for our way of life. You can put a brownie brownie in charge of that. I've got it, can you think? Right. He'll do it. Take a good job, brownie. On. MPs organizing the campaign to impeach Tony Blair, believe they have an up support to force a highly damaging commons investigation into the Prime Minister's pre-work conduct. Remember how they sexed up the intelligence? Oh yeah. Make sure it's held in the do with Camilla and Charles. I'll tell you that. That would be sexy. Oh, and we knew it attempt to impeach the Lerobor claims he misled Parliament into making his case for work against the rack will be made in the comments within the next two weeks. Let's hear it. Oh, right. This is from the Scottish Sunday, Harold, by the way. They put a different kind of a slant and killed on the news. The impeachment process effectively star-lice here when just 23 MP signed a comment motion. But the scale of the government's defeat on its anti-terror legislation last week where 49 labor MPs defected has galvanized the momentum for proceedings to be invoked. They've got the logo and now baby. They've got the logo and. Organizers say they're expecting 200 cross-party signatures, including those of former government ministers, the force that commenced to set up a pre-work council investigation that will examine and detail the case from impeachment against Blair. They're going to send his ass to the pre-work. The signs of labor, although they are more civilized than America, I would say that. What was our watch in last night about Canada and England and about being murder rate? Is like about one, one, one, a little bit of what it is in the USA. And it has a long history of just even though they have a lot of guns in Canada, like Michael Morshrodha, they just don't go around shooting each other. Maybe it's just being a little bit of civilization and just having a little respect for human life. And I suppose to the USA, where your fan asked Governor says, hey, I'll throw over first. Somebody looks at your cross-eyed. Somebody sneaks up here behind you at the AT&T and looks at speeches. Or maybe he's over in a couple of shades two-darts. Load our crap away. And because that's the way it is in the US, may. The signs of labor revolt allies to unify opposition ventures as said to have changed the climate inside the Commons. SNP leader Alex Salmond, one of the key figures in the impeachment campaign, sitting out believe the cross-party incentive agreement to account over the Iraq War would become more urgent than predicted problems associated with social legislation in England and Wales. And Wales, now if they say Wales, Wales, Wales, Wales, Wales, Wales, Wales. They can't speak to him, they can't speak it. That's the L. Oh God, they have a little problem. Don't forget FPL going to rot in hell. Maybe they'll be down there with your president too. That's the L. Is Neil Rogers? This is by 16. Good morning Americans, it's Paul Harvey. Stand by for news. A lawyer's dog running around town unleashed. Heds for a butcher's shop and steals. A road, still say it again. And lawyers dog running around town unleashed. Heds for a butcher's shop and steals. A road. The butcher goes to the lawyer's office and asks, if a dog running unleashed, he'll be a piece of meat for my store. I have the right to demand payment for the meat from the dog's owner. The lawyer answers absolutely. Well then you owe me a 50 year dog was loose and stole from me a roast. The lawyer would out of the word, wrote the butcher a check for $8.50 and send the butcher having a feeling of satisfaction. Left his office. Three days later, the butcher finds a bill from the lawyer. $100 do for consultation. Paul Harvey. Good day. Absolutely. I figured it got all your time. If there was a good fart on the air. Here she is. Bellcard told she, 10 grounded losers have arrived right in August. He will suit you around 1000 euros because he was a man when they were asked? How would you answer a 1 minute police? Hell yeah. Okay, don't say 3, 2. and a list of white people's fault and honky honky, he starts playing honky, Tom Fibildogget. The Reverend Jesse Jackson called a Philadelphia Eagles punishment of Terrell Owens, much too severe. What do you know, what's Jesse? Yamama, how do you like that? What do you like about important things? We got 265 Dmitry Merck and Troops in Iraq and you were about Terrell Owens. Talk about being a professional black man. We got professional faggots and professional Cubans and professional Jews, and here's a professional dark man. Jackson said in the statement released Friday that Owens could have been more professional publicly completed about his contract, his team and the Eagles organization. But Jackson said Owens is spent with our pay for four games and the activation for the rest of the season is much to severe for the charge and hurts the athletes and I felt career at his height. And like I said, Yamama, who cares? The civil rights act of the set, the level of punishment could have been more than if Owens had been caught shaving points, selling drugs, carrying or gun, or fighting fans without sufficient restraint. This does not warrant a one-year ban from the game Jackson said, and in the Eagles who released Owens to be open market or free agency, if they no longer want to associate with him. What's he doing? He's a little piece of the pie there or something. What's the story there? I don't know. And guess who else jumps on his land wagon? Ralph Nader, a consumer activist and former presidential candidate, has already called to this suspension to be rescinded. Is this the Fedacle War? Does this Ralph Nader and Jesse Jackson, they're worried about a football tergan suspended as a big mouth and I like a jackass? Owens was a discredited last week after he said, interview that the Eagles showed a lack of class for not publicly recognizing in some of the career touchdown case, and team would be better off with Greenbrage's bread far recorder back, if it's apologized. I think that maybe Terrell was listening to much to Rush Limbaugh, taking a few cheap shots at Donovan McMahon. See, and that's one thing about the right wingers no matter what they do, no matter what they do, it nothing happens, right? Just like Bill Bennett, and a grotesque comment he made about a boarding black babies, and just like Russian is not the shoppin and Phil Puffin and his full-length deafness because he was poppin, and I see his name like that. And then his comments, I got him canned and money that football about the Donovan McNad and he's not going to get all of the attention because he's a black, and he's not really all that good. And then just things to anybody else really got to put into writers island with for without goldstein. But no. Then Bill will rally seeing that the people of San Francisco, you know, they all rotten hell and that if there was a god, they were all, well, whatever he said, you see that story over the weekend? Yeah. I'll put him up with a big stupid mouth, not to mention. I'll court all his phone excavates. Phil Ophel, I'll speak of that. Terrell knows that in the interview last week and engaged in some unsforceful life spin and Jesse went on and on, now the odd yati, the punishment is much to severe for the charge and yati, odd yati. The real question is to his comments, one of the penalties to this severe, and Jesse says the answer is no. This does have more than one year ban for the game. The NFL players association taking a position that the punishment doesn't correspond with the infraction and the association must be equals to cut TO. If the Nakoda we in state am I agree, TO is publicly apologized. His heart is contrite. His heart is contrite. Well, what does that supposed to mean? So his Michael Jackson was right there with Michael Jackson too, remember that? Yes, he was. I got it. You should be black, or at least close to it. Who's not whiter than even you are, and that's saying to help a lot, talk about a wider shade of pale. This Jesse, man, he's just I can't handle it. And it's like the OJ thing, the same old crap. Everybody, you know, that old saying birds of a feather spread the bird virus together. That's right. That's what they do. Birds of a feather stick together. If it's a black man accused of some, all not all, but a whole bunch of black men. All not all that's a racial thing. And if it's a subterner or whatever it is, I don't remember any white people getting all upset about the Ted Bundy getting executed, do you? No, I didn't hear anybody. Bitch in the body. No. What the hell is this? What the OJ? You said what they do three times. Oh, what they do? And that inspired me. What they do? A long one thing you do. It might not want this song after that, not a long one, of course. The difference is. We don't. Whether we quarter the walls, doggy point. Yeah. I could be the whole former song now. We got 703 votes. Right about it. Not too shabby. What they do? All right. Yeah. Okay. 560, 560, 550. You won't hear this kind of radio on the ticket. I'll guarantee that while we're talking about a bunch of stupid ball games. What about to dumb jokes who can't spell crap. Okay. We have to have assistance taken one. Forget about saying it. Really sick and tired of these stupid ass foretures, man. And it's just, once upon a time, I know this may come as a shock to a lot of you. People out there, a lot of you pucks like Josh. Once upon a time, there wasn't no such thing as a sports talk radio station. Get out. Yeah. How do you like that? I don't even know what those words mean. I mean, like on I would be back in the day when we had a great radio station. We had like, we had the sports talk between 6 and 8 p.m. Two hours a day. And believe me, like I told you about 5,000 times, that was plenty. And don't forget they had the sunny hurs sports update as part of the morning show. Yeah. You know, what does that have to do with anything? Nothing. You know, just to keep them up to date on what's going on, what, you know, first thing in the morning. I like sunny as a good guy was, but you know, what is that? Get a quaggle. I totally that stir-wound was first working at KAT and a little apartment on the beach. Oh, what? I didn't like too long with those real loud Israeli, with a downstairs screaming and yelling. I'm not about all day. I got out of there fast. Anyway, go, I do my show. I go home and in a sports talk is I'm a sunny hurs. And I'm listening and hear a sunny hurs doing that. And I'm thinking, what's wrong with my radio? Is there something wrong with this? It's a true story. I don't know. Yeah, exactly. And suddenly had some kind of a throat a quaggle condition, which I thought, Well, that's a great guy. Nice guy seems like a good enough guy, but how can you be on a radio when you got a, like that? That's a natural vibrato. No, that's not what it was at all. And we had an operation on that one or two or, I don't know, and then he died. That was there was bad. Good guy. See the good guy's died early in the best you'd say, and then hang on till our 100. John Nichols writes, God's Pat Robertson problem. You know, that thing about Robert Sheer getting candidly at the time. I don't know if the audience realizes how significant I read. How many of his columns have I read? About 30 minutes. Yeah, as soon as he's great. Yes. One of my very favorites. And I was going to be Huffington Post. If you want to read this stuff, you'll be able to do on the Huffington website or area. But it's just bone-shilling what's going on now. You can't be to the left of a total of 100 American anymore. And, uh, beyond the air, have a right of column to let anything. The Nazis have taken over, maybe. It's all strictly censorship. And that's why the mainstream media, that's why they keep pantering and sucking up. Plus the fact that GE's got all the big contracts there in Iraq. So that's one of the reasons that all your NBCs, they just dummy up as much as possible. Except for Keith Obermann, watch for a hint of a next to give canned. He'll probably be next. Probably stand readed to two hours. Because if he had two hours or no, can you imagine how many? We probably have that to kill him. We're all ready, right? Yeah. And a robo marathon will be good. Chicken robo, I love it. Shhh, ha ha ha. How can she be on the air, speak it up? Oh, like that. The high-stitch, you know. John Nichols says it can't be easy being God these days. What was so many of his self-proclaimed followers launching wars in his name. So the last thing the Almighty needs is a whack job calling down the wrath of, well, God on communities that fail the follow the instructions in the Christian coalition voter guide. But that's what God has gotten the first and the Pat Robertson they religious broadcaster frequently uses 700 club television program to pray about weather patterns or to encourage the assassination of foreign leaders. Last week, Robertson went the next step and began deciding who and can and cannot talk to God. After the citizens of Dober Pencilvania voted to remove eight school war members of what attempted to introduce and entail their design curriculum, which encourages the rejection of science and established views of evolution in order to promote the notion that the universe was simply popped into being by the big guy. Robertson announced that people living in that community are off God's Christmas card list. I'd like to say the good citizens of Dober if there's a disaster in your area don't turn to God. You just rejected him from your city Robertson said on this Christian broadcast and never 700 club. Instead of praying to God, Robertson said the folks in Dober will have to worship science. If they have future problems in Dober, I recommend they call on Charles Darwin, the television person out of the declared, maybe he can help him. To be sure, there will be those sincere disbelievers who suggest that Paris to Darwin would be a equal consequence of the Paris to the Almighty. That's what the May for another day. But the choice that Robertson said some forefathers of his Christian faith is a false one. Many of the greatest evolutionary scientists of history in the present day have been men of women of deeper Buddhist faith with Christians well represented among their number. The scientists of suggestions some of the most thoughtful and elderness of our time that the study of evolution can and should be seen as an endeavor that is entirely in sync with their faith. After all, they asked what could be wrong, which tried to be a better explained God's creation. The answer of course is nothing unless you made a fortune setting yourself up his thoughts. Spokesman Robertson is elected by science because of a wise explanations in insights that expose their suit of religious rants about who's on the right or wrong side of God. Not to mention who gets to pray and how for what they are. Scheme's just here Christians in the voting for Robertson right when allies and writing checks to Robertson's enterprises and causes. The so-called Christian broadcaster is wrong this time as he so frequently been in the past. Despite what Robertson says, the people of Dober can pray to whom every day choose. God or Charles Darwin even pet Robertson and they can believe as no doubt most of the offensive of any voters do when they cast their ballots that sound religion sound science need not be in comfort. That's John Nicholman, Malaysia. Well nation under. Damn God. God most coming up at two o'clock and we got the mad dog three solar hours at four crudists for three and a half hours seven to ten thirty and then that hurried came stuff and see atleman gonna have a huge tune of audience for that.

So when you think by now how many weeks has this been going on? Not really. I'm coming as silly person. There was a little bit for now that this thing would be fixed already. No without crack engineering staff. Guess what the hurricane's been over for about three weeks now. We got no more excuses about running around with generators and transmitters keeping the stations down the air. Remember this has nothing to do with the hurricane. Yeah. Hold on. I'll support it. That's what I'm saying. This thing is to go on for months and months and months. This audio vault is that fault. That's because our engineering staff is to busy with a finger up each other. Yeah. Probably checking out the prosthesis. So what's the hurricaneosis? We're going to do it in the other room. Are we not going to play this sponsored album? We're going to go spot free radio or whatever. Yeah. Let me go plug them in the other room. I guess. Is there a girl plug in the other room? I'll read the pulverzo while you're plugging it. 719 votes. That was good. Like that. We need a lot more of those. And I'll kind of like. During will, I wanted to get your best information. TV audio on radio has moved in the first place. 180. Open up that pod. We like that. That's what we're going to be doing from now on. In fact, I think there's a cloud in this guy.

So they probably invited tuning into us during those trying times. They figured that's just a stupid sports nerd station. What did they possibly know? But in poker they possibly give us right? Right. That's the price to pay when your priorities are screwed upside down. Greg. So what's the deal? Am I going to place some spots in there or not? No, it'll be just down in there as well.

It says stick your battery in and have a good time and joy those good vibrations And that what you said I still don't get it. So in other words you use it once in a while But use your brawn most of I understand to me. It's not like a mixed in mass thing because I've done both in my life I've you I had to treat my easy electric razors I had the new real co you know the triple hitter and their real co You know I've tried them all and I don't like electric razors because it burns man It irritates your skin and you don't get a close shape and you're never gonna get this close to show you ever I don't care brawn. I don't care if it's able brawn You're never gonna get as close to the cream as you are with like a regular razor with a blade. I mean it is handy even if it's just a gay blade Well, it is handy or to use the electric razor I mean it's less of a mass, but yeah, you never got a good feeling Let me ask you something seriously when you've got a really good disposable razor or even this mock What are you how long is it really taking anymore? I mean now with it like if he used edge or any We need good shape cream is opposed to that full me stuff. It looks like Santa Claus and bad day How long is really take to shape? We need three four minutes. Not that long at all right not even that Especially now that I got my motorized woman at battery in there boy sure what my battery doesn't run out I'm probably I'm gonna go get it and play that little I want to go get it and play the vibration on here. Maybe we can sell some Oh We're in the brings vibranic things You do that all day Hey Josh, I'm gonna grab a razor call my phone See and actually Josh ought to be using this because he likes the the feel of the electric in the vibration right You come to get a vibration going here to say combine with the disposable blade so oh Nice And you and stereo Well, I'm moving it around a mic see I'm holding my phone up when you can hear it Why you got one or two that's owned by braids when I wanted to If I'm a vibration station, maybe we're vibrate over here This is a pretty neat thing. I mean you don't know if that accomplishes anything you know they get it I don't know Listen it is a very close shave. I think you maybe even a little closer than the other one Really disposable even if it just feels good Yeah, worth it. Not but it it's not it's psychological, but it's good. No in your case. Yeah Definitely psychological. I know no question about it It make no mistake about it But he you know he found that thing you probably open up a lot of his girlfriends drawers. I mean so to speak and There was that instrument all the sudden he got into this whole vibrate and thing now Survey everything is divided probably that's what's wrong with the audio of all he's got that baby vibrate and two And it finally keeps giving out from all the pressure 700 80 posts come on we can do 900 today. What do you think? Can we do 900 on a Monday week after the power is back on different most people not all if you're in a trader park I would just I just leave okay? Think anything you still want and just set the whole thing on fire and just leave the instrument right now Forget about that just burn it and collect the insurance I wouldn't imagine that's too easy to get like mobile home insurance and place like Florida where we have a hurricane every Prime Minister it is not and I was told that depending on where it is you can't get any Homeowners insurance Wow, if you're in it so one more good reason not to be a trailer track I mean to live in a trailer park not good not good at all even even he got a double wide No, I told you once upon a time and I'll be in Michigan in my early days in radio I lived and not very long either a few months in a trailer.
