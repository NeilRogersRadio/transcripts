Yep I can in this curse Oh Okay, when they are we're getting tired of you You they are you should be true That's good You You I have no rush You In the limit of the repetition. It's just that never ends of the trial Open yesterday in the 3 million are plus lawsuit by 13 people who said they were injured or traumatized when federal agencies they screaming alienate Dolganzala's from his mommy relative's home. You know they mommy relative? That's the ones. What are how a merit-screasy ass is doing? Then she get married to some like 12 year old kid? I don't know. We were the opening of a new part in the opening witness was neighbor Maria Riera who testified that she clutched her chest and thought she was dying when an agent doused her with tear gas during the April 22nd, 2008 to be a 9th of 6 year old boy with his father and Cuba. The 13 neighbors and protesters are seeking up to 250 grand of peace claiming that agents used excessive force during the armed raid. I was stopped by a gentleman on my left approaching me with a shotgun said Riera who lived across the street from the home where the boy had lived short since shortly after being rescued from a shipwreck. I'm Thanksgiving Day 1999. She said a black guard agent wearing a mask or to her to stand back where he would shoot any word of profanity or he would shoot. She said she complied by the second agent of personal the gas gun and she stood in a driveway left her in a great cloud of tear gas. I'd love to see that. A total of 108 people sued over the raid but US District Judge came Michael Moore limited the case of people who were not on the Gonzalez family property and were beyond police burrcaids. Ali on now 11. I bet you the umbrellas are really impressed now. Ali on now 11 was one of three survivors of a shipwreck that killed his mother the way took place after the family refused to return to boys so he could be taken back to Cuba Cuba because he's missing a traffic mail. In Cuba it was Cuba. Today but that's to register never dies. And the reason I'll say it again he's going to live a hell a lot longer being over there because he's not eating McDonald's everything is not getting that happy meal. By the way, that's a bill cut the crap we got it stopped that same. What is he faction? Is that bill on for Lauderdale? It's just some guy. It's a different bill. All of his bill on for Lauderdale he's been he's been on his good behavior. His facts are some good crap. The pages of crap that I request we can't even discuss. We can't even discuss. Well like one, give me a clue about he wants a bit that doesn't exist. I see. Oh brother, hey Bill, can it? Okay. Here's the poor result from yesterday who best fits this description. And look what it says on it and realize it little lot of typo there by Eric who best fist this description. Not fits but fist. But that's the bill. That's the bit that Bill wanted to hear. That's fist and bit. I think we can even say that. Sorry, Joyce. That **** didn't fit. Someone became more popular after death is what we're looking for. And Jesus Christ 564 votes are ain't nobody close to Jesus. Well God. Can you blame him? You probably don't smell too bad. Good after all those experiences. You don't express it on that bloody stuff up on the cross that Mel Gibson was making up. I mean portraying it is as it was. Well the movie priest was on last night. It would kind of get. Yeah. Jesus Christ 564. Elvis 98. You see not even anybody close I mean. Wow Jesus is in a class by himself. Elvis 98 Nicole Simpson 85 James D 85. Two pack at 57. How's he doing? Seline 53. Pat Tillman 46. Kurt Cobain 37. JFK 34. Bruce Lee 32. Jim Morrison had. Maryland Monroe 29 and Frank 28 Martin Luther King Jr. 28 Bob Marley 26. Francis Diana was tied with Vincent Vango 24 piece.

Reverend Jim Jones. Reverend Jones had nine votes. Which is pretty impressive. Buddy Holly Heddy. How could Buddy Holly only have a vote? That shows you how limited the audience. How do I mind? Buddy Holly became so much more popular after they even made a movie about him with a Gary Pooce of Boosey. To Pernicus Heddy, George R. Well, five John Lennon had five. Ali F. Frankie Lyman had five. David Koresh for Jerry Garcia for Bobby Darren for he still's pushing splashing it. John Holmes had four. He's not splashing too much and no more. After it's got finally won up for three Freddie Mercury had a pair at Erin's early semi way had one. That was that deal. A lot of almost 1500 votes yesterday. He's pulled onto the best. We have a shocking document here. I happen to have a copy of my hands. I can't tell you where I obtained it from. The Beesley Broadcast group employee feedback survey. That's what Hank was this. Stanley, three, Schmitt candid. He tossed it. I mean, this is a joke. And of course, the timing of it is so appropriate. And at the time when the entire, I can't speak to the rest of their company because I don't really care about it because we only work for this radio station. But this station is in such a state of turmoil that it's almost indescribable. And so I guess their solution to the problems that they're having is to try to put a survey out. And of course, they don't give any of us. I'm not an employee. So I wouldn't get one anyway. But George didn't get one. Josh Kortiston yet. One is if you're probably optioned so you can get mine to gamble with. See, never let out of us that you were a compulsive gambler. They were still way to get into a casino. I'm totally the farthest thing from compulsive gamblers when I'm here. And that's why we're so upset that the Patriots kept the seat is ask you today. Well, there's money or some part of anybody at Petson football games. I don't want to like pee on Hank's parade, man. But people have been on ball games and stuff like that. And even look at him. He's like, you know, one of the big shot handy cameras. And his record is like a marginal of best, right? Yeah, for football. And he bets everything. And I didn't ask you to pick on Hank for being a compulsive. By the way, Hank, don't lose to lunch today. He's nice to plunge in what's wrong with that. It's his money. You don't have to answer to anybody. That's why I look at it. I mean, this business like people try to say, if you have money that you're gambling, that you can't afford to gamble, then you got a serious problem, Josh. Why? Why not you get to afford to be gambling? I don't like you. That's got a little beat up TV set that's still waiting for a gift from George. And I got news also more news for George couldn't afford it. You can't afford to buy himself a TV. So much as far as I want you for you. Yeah, he could buy like one of those little old nine inch black and white jobs. Did the bees that well, I'll be do the break because once we get, I don't want to spend a lot of time on this thing. But when I read the questions, he'll find it most of the news. He'll chuck a longer phrase that you're doing for me. I'll tell you that. Six more dead soldiers in Iraq and I can't even find a story on it because now they're not even counting anymore. I'm talking about US soldiers. Can't even find it anymore. Yeah, the barbed box are mentioned at this morning. Right. Well, you know what, she's one of those county pinko from the left coast. I say barber boxer for president. Oh, oh, back, barama. Oh, repeat. What a ticket that would be. Wow, kick some serious. All those liberals. Yeah, through our timely rough liberals back to save us from this right wing crap from this fascism. It's destroying our freedom of speech and everything else, man. I sound like sufficiently worked up a lot. No, nobody cares anymore because the elections are when I was going on a more crap like hey, here's Johnny. He's still dead. I'm not doing anymore, Johnny. No for that. I didn't like him that much anyway. He was an icon. He was legendary. He was there for a long time. I'm turning man. But I am still not buying it. He just didn't do anything for me. I don't think he was that funny. Ten 13, but he was a good guy. Lee stuffy. He reminded his own business and he was kind of reclusive and he's kept himself and the people liked him. See, that's good. That's the best said important if somebody's entertaining that they have to be a good guy. But at least at the other some points for him. Right. Everybody speaks very well, 10 13 if I was 16, but he couldn't. They don't speak too highly of Mo and that's because you got that big ugly ball spot. It's called his head. It's like Boko Brian a lot of other people. I know and of course me too. I got a big ugly ball spot. Never thought I could do much for me to go to Chuck Alphay or because in my case, you know, it's a well-make a difference. But a lot of you guys cases, it will make a difference because that big ugly ball spot makes you look horrendous and a lot older too. Charlie's been making guys look their best rovers 30 count.

We now, all the standard now, All the standard now. 16th 11, we like Bull-Gallon. It's quite a fact that he's bailing out. He's going to the competition, but that's okay. See, unlike D4, who bailed out, He didn't really bail out. He got the sands kicked out. He's going to do the morning show because he turned out to be in the car. But unlike D4, whom we despise like boys, and then we like a lot. No matter where he goes, we wish him the best of success. Even though it looks like he's going to be on right opposite us, how do we do how do we do? Oh my god. Now this article by Barry Jackass and the hero this morning, Sean B. Turns down Marlison, M.A. R. L.I.S.N. to join ESPN in 790. Way to do another very good job on their website. They had 24 years. They held website below. It's one of the worst. It starts out by saying, Facebook, R.S.B. and television, and talk show for 790 ESPN radio. So in other words, there's like one or two lines missing there. It's just crats, cock out, which you'd expect to hear. Fox sports network offered Sean B. to Marlison's TV play by a play job last Tuesday. And all parties expected an agreement, including us. Didn't we just about announce it on the air? Right. Then we said was the only of the English courtists who's in Marlison, and Saturday, it's done. I thought so. Yeah, we all thought so. But, yes, why? It's never done. ESPN caused Sean B.34 to reconsider by offering a package of 30. But third man. Baseball games on ESPN on Monday or Wednesday nights. Because of baseball blackout rules, ESPN televised a two-game simultaneous league set Sunday nights. And Sean B. We'll do the second to read the backup game in many cases. Sean B.<|pl|> was called Colons Football and Basketball Games for ESPN Regional TV. So here's the base start to be on like original national mudboards that'll be on ESPN. About 30 baseball. A third man. Season. Sean B. Who will leave his job as a Marlison's radio announced after eight seasons. We'll also do a talk show for 790. The program like we will be from 10-A into one p. and all the hours aren't definite. Craig Minner, Vini, and Jason Salabkin, currently are the host of hours on 790. Well, maybe they can like all be on there at the same time. Kind of like us in Stern. Right? Sure. Overlock. Just jam walling in there together. Fox Sports, other finalists for the Marlison TV job or which walls. I wonder if he's kind of jack walls. Huh? That's his name. Rich walls. I know what you're going to say. I don't get how many day ago getting a what? Great small boom by's come out on a one-way. There's a little handle Seattle Marlison. Marlison pregame in post game shows on TV and Bob McGillot who announced his mind-release baseball in hockey in Syracuse, New York. Walswood appear to be the front run into the work alongside Tommy Onel, less Fox Sports decides to be open the search. Like one of those nationwide searches. Like we do a QAM. The Marlison's also must hire. We do an on-site reputation. I'm going to work alongside the Trimily, come and do seem day van horn boring. It says here. While 790 was adding Shelby on Monday, the market's third all sports station, which has a point in men round the clock. At least they're consistent. They may not be good, but at least they're consistent. Oh, that's it. That's what they had no measurable audience, those games were things that could have been recorded. Last Sunday dubbed the ministry will suggest howontic luck yes. This game looks like a war between gay and child loss. The New Yorkers Asttset wrote you an important that's the old light bulb frequency with about six watts as what's the point. Here's one for our pull from Fredo. It says, how about James our next after guns smoke? He disappeared. Pastor then Johnny. How about James our next I would agree with that. He always a Mat Dylan right? Right. And then it was in. Don't remember anything else. Speaking of Mat Dylan, whatever happened to him, not that I missed him at all. He was okay in Dr. or cowboy. Yeah. Was that the movie? Yes it was. Yeah, he was good in that. I could live without him. He just kind of vanished in me. Sort of good to think what he's done lately. Not much. He must have done somebody. Here's the pull so far. Who is or was the most type cast after actress of all time? 82 votes so far. We'll get a whole bunch more names on here and make it really interesting or not. As the case may be, Bella Legosi had 26. Eddie come help me please Eddie. Call Eddie. Bella who had a thing for Johnny Depp and who could blame him. Charles Bronson 14. Boris Carl off 14. What that Martin Landell, what a great actor.

Irene Ryan's got one and Peter Faulkton have any yet. Peter Faulkstas had been a lot of other movies. He was a lot more than just Columbo. Nevertheless. Why? Why would you call it? Well, today's crowd was thinking of as Columbo. And that's it. Anything else we'll be no credibility. See that's tight cast. In other words, you're so of you. I got another one for you. I got two more. You got a two more. I got a big fat growing two more. Adam West. Oh, they heard more. They heard a few more. Can you see it? Adam West and Bert Ward. In fact, on biography, when you see the thing about them and about Batman and everybody. They're one of them. That's what they talk about. And they've been hanging on going around the country. Doing these Batman revival types shows you because that's it. That's what everybody views the mass. And of course Robin, now that was old green tights in Fitten and I thought he's a well Martin Lendau is still alive. Good news. I'm looking at Barbabade right now. Please come to QAM Hello. Hey Neil.

I did it. And you're getting Barbara King, M.B. I got nothing on IMDB for Barbara King. How is that possible? Bar, how are you spelling it? V-A-I-N. Right. Yeah. She's the Vayne of our existence. So here we go. Go to the bottom of other pages. Wow. 560560, Pound 560, and Verizon, Sing it a while to slide. That was a damn good show. Mission impossible. You know? Mm-hmm. Dang good. Line 9. WQA, and hello. Hey Neil, I was a going. Pretty good, pal. I got two for you. Oh, okay. Uh, Beverly Hills, Billy's. I got a jet throw. He was even though that entertainment show where he was going to commit suicide because he didn't get any job. Max Bear. Max Bear. Yeah. Okay. It was great Morris. How about David Cassidy? David Cassidy is excellent. He was this all he ever questioned about is that he was like timecast. Yes. And he's, she's swell. Okay, see. Greg, more sense right. That's great Morris. Perfect. But he went on to executive stuff later on and Max Bear from the Beverly Hillbillies. So he never wanted to get another job acting. But he was a part of it. But that's not the worst thing. But that's not the worst thing. What? What? What? Somebody go on and ever succeed anything else. But as far as an actor was concerned, he was tight cast as he might have a good more entice cast. That's what I said. That's the first thing I said. Yeah. But he didn't try to get anything else. Well, maybe he knew he couldn't get anything else. How do you like that? How about David Cassidy? Do we have him on there? Yeah. He should be. He's sure oughta be. We got the Brady bunch on here. Do we have the partridge family? God forbid. Get the guy with the eyes all worked up in the squeeze himself. We're not allowed to sit on here. Good. Got the Brady bunch. See, you got to call me for about the Brady bunch. What are you going to do? Put all your names on your ear. Where do you get actor or actress? Everybody who's ever. Yeah. That was just one of them all on there. We'll do a search on it. We'll pull like 7,000 names of every child actor or actress who was ever in a movie around TV. We'll put a while on there. Shmuck. WDQA and hello. Pretty good. About Michael Richards, Kramer from Sanco. I never watched that. I hate that. So I have no idea. What do you say, guys? Sure. Whatever you say. And some to the thrill with it. I don't know who that is. I never watched that show for like 2 minutes. Jerry Seinfeldman. He gives me the hevy debies. I do mean hevy. He's a little guy. I can't deal with him. He's nauseating. He's just dripping with that certain New York oozy thing. Barbara Davis still alive. Barbara Maine and Martin Landour are both still alive. I like that. I mentioned impossible. I hit him with five shots. And there's still alive. And divorce. Long since divorce. But that was kind of interesting, you know, a satellite to the fact that they were both on their show. And they were husband and wife at that time. And not real interesting. But mildly interesting. You think? Model, moderately interesting. Speaking of moderately interesting, the Oscar nominations announced after the top of the hour. We're like, kill about two minutes with that. When I see that Leo is on here, it just makes me want to. Yeah, how can anybody take that thing seriously? You know, God. It's just it's amazing to me that, you know, even pedolasing the American public. And also the so-called critics and experts. You can pedal any kind of crap, you know. He must have some really good naked pictures of somebody. Or he's doing something. He's pathetic. He's a silly person. He's a simple man. He's a little screemer. Greg's boy is Leo. Huh? Greg Morris. The guy just called it and said that five minutes ago, when you were busy arguing with him about Max bear. David. He said Greg Morris. That's what he said. David. Then who? I said, I said, I say Greg Morris is then. I said, then. Did I say that? Did you say that? No, no, no. I thought he was there. And now we know for sure. Damn it. There seems to be a lot of that going around. Oh, there we go. Damn, I thought I was going to be next. Am I doing a live spot here or not? I guess not. No. Because I already threw the long way. See today, I want to like, I want to start getting ahead of myself. This business of not scratching out the breaking. That's all because of that time thing that we went through. And as far as Mo is concerned about doing tend to do, I have everything just fine with me. It's already 11 o'clock and we like barely said our fan ass is done in the chairs. You're the center. We are Roger. We are going to have a school lunch and play. On 560 60. Are you a... This is the Neal Roger, so. This is your brain. Oh, go, go, go, go, go. Any questions? Some stations you can call. Some stations you can call. But this station is going to give you the best gift of all. Because this station is going to give you. It's going to give you a piece of mine. There's that. It will give you a first color. When you hear the sound. There. And we will give you a lobotomy. That's right. We will remove the part of your brain responsible for coherent thoughts. No more fear. No more problem. Just stay after day of peace. Some living in a semi-bechipated state. You'll be surrounded by people who will close you. Feed you. When record your every lobotomy. And your days playing with bits of paper and brightly colored blood. We'll see four hour pieces of, because you had lobotomy. This station is not reliable for botanies that lead winners really stupid instead of peaceful. But we will try to find you a nice job in an area convenient store on the night ship in the back. Lose your mind. Literally. Keep listening. Go away. Or just come to work in QA. And it'll have the same effect. Love it a clock at QAM. Here's one that I thought to put on there. But I have seen them in a variety of other things, especially lately. Robert De Niro says Elmer. Right. He's a mobster, but not lately. He's been in some of the other things. He's been in some of the other things. He's been in some of the other things. And another good one is on Elmer's list. Here Joe Peshi. Even though he was in, what was that awful boxing movement that everybody raves about, Raging bull. But he's still played the same character. Pretty much. He's still the same thing. He's always like that. Here's a very good one. How about Henry Wainford of Fines? He's a fine. What I owe, boy, do I despise him or why? What? Here you go again. Every day everybody. You just sit in a hard ass. You don't like anybody. Except Tom Rating. Come on, dance, dance, dance, dance. I guess like David Cassidy, I'm proud to admit it. He's sure was pretty. I'm home, not a dog and his wife. We'll be great. So there it is. I don't want to disappoint your friend to go with the eyes. Because if we got him upset, he wouldn't show up at any more of your appearances. I would see him in a long time. Good. Thank God. Maybe he died to go with the eyes. Oh, we have a party. He's a vine. The old George Reeves, the original Superman killed himself because of being tough. There's a lot of debate about what if he actually committed suicide or not. There were graves. In fact, if you go on one of those biography channels show us you'll remember, and now you'll see one of these deals about who was the other one from Hogan's Heroes. Oh, I forgot. The poor old freak. Oh, Bob, Bob, I'm crying. Oh, Bob, I'm crying. Oh, I'm crying. When you get rid of it or what? Sorry. Man, Bob, I'm crying, right? A lot of rumor was he was murdered. Anyway, George Reeves, you know, you might want to put Superman in parentheses on that Josh because who else is going to know George Reeves? They think we're talking about Jim Reeves, the old friend from music company. Christopher Reeves, North Chris Reeves, not the Superman. That thing was Superman and Reeves, man. It's not a good combination. And in fact, even planes Superman, Bob Koyer, played Superman on a radio and got a van. He died. He had to be on to talk with truth on TV, remember, Bob Koyer? Look. And also, what was that other horrible game he was on? Or they had like a limited time to do those stupid stunts? What was that? I don't know what it was. Booker Brian Olo. Here's the number one choice to court of this fact, which is, it's no matter what movie he was in, he played the same cool character and your right. John Wayne, the Duke. John Wayne, get that under immediately even he goes zooming to the top. He'll pass metal like he's laid out in a box, right? Yep. John Wayne, boy, can he act or what? You don't mess with the Duke. And what was his name again, Marion? Beat the clock. Beat the clock. Very good. Thanks, Bob Koyer Brian. Yep. I guess I'll play it. Just a humor him. He did a bit that I didn't put in a computer because, uh, I'm just a stereotype. If anybody's ever seen Bob Koyer Brian, which is most people haven't, if you saw him, then this would be very, very funny. If you don't know him, I'm never saw him. He's the picture of his head on the website. There he goes. Get it. And now for you, youngsters. I will wrap my bald head. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. I'll wrap it. There you go. That's your own table over here. That'll be enjoyed. Well, no, it's a... It's a good side thing. Well, we find it all very amusing. But Tracy and Kendall has three nominations for the pool. It's a good thing. The first one isn't going to qualify. The first three is one too many. Carol O'Card, which I would say absolutely not. I mean, Carol O'Card is lasting. It was at awful in the heat of the night. He's at the night series on TV. And he was, I don't know. I agree with that more than Robert DeNiro. You read with what? He's more type-cast than Robert DeNiro. If we're going to be relative. No. I think it's some ins and men's a half and half. Okay. We'll put Carol O'Card around her. A lot of people else all in those R2 bunkers. All, you know. Right? Right. It gives me an exclusive play these themes again. Well, let's do that every day. Sure. We won't have any audience left. We won't have to be great. Oh, that's not true. Every day will love it. Do we love it? Oh, I don't know. I don't know. Okay. That's all. Carol O'Card, Gary Coleman. Oh, yeah. Mijit. And Barbara Eden. Yeah. I saw Barbara Eden a couple of other things. But I think definitely when you see Barbara, you knew Think of Jeannie, right? Right. I like Harper Valley, PTA. And Tracy says, go a path to have a great day. Thanks, Tracy. Three for three. Here's Jim, who says, Governor Arnold belongs on your pool. Oh, yeah. It's all he is. Terminally, I'm not just Arnold. Got it. Got it. Pulse exists would be great now if they had managed. Who would be great now if they managed to stay alive? Oh, Brandon will do. I've owed his any caqron. Remember, any caqron sitting in the balcony? Nope. I do. I think there was any caqron. I'm pretty sure. Anyway, a poll for who would be great now if they managed to stay alive? Hmm. I don't think there were that many of them. Well, what the audience will hear is names and dead people. No, no. No people like died before they. People who died young before they were not long enough for doing. They were going to say this question. Like Brandon the will though. That's only what I can think of. It says Eddie Cochran. Okay, singer. Buddy Holly, but Buddy Holly did achieve a fame. That's in effect. He was on yesterday's pool after he and she had a lot more votes. By the way, shame on you people became legendary after he died. And he wasn't a good singer. He was a very mediocre. You know, Peggy. He said, who? Who? Who? He was a horrible. Yeah. Family. The day he was. He was weak and weak and wimpy and goofy looking in the Yahoo. But now he's legendary because after some people died, they become legendary. You know what I mean? Like for example. Now just a joke, Johnny. Just like now. And now for you. Yes sir. Five six seven. Five sixty. Five sixty. Not the Verizon and singular. Fireless line. W to Q a m. Hello. No. Yes sir.

Maybe we can do tomorrow's full right here now. Okay, the first one your listeners won't like because they can't call in with their silly comments. Oh, that's it. The original B. Outlaw yesterday. Oh, right. And the second one is who what entertainer, you know singer actor whoever has done more for human rights, you know like mother and Brando with unions and you know they'll go like that's they can call in and say names. Has done the most for human rights. Yes, civil rights human rights. We're entertainer. Well, how long is that list going to be? I don't I can't go up with a couple. Yeah. I mean I'm sure there's a ton. There are. Yeah. Get a third. We'll put our thinking camp on. Thanks a lot, family. See, pretty weak. How many of your friends? Yeah, he needs to get a start. Besides that moral of bread. Yeah, I mean with the Indian. I mean just because he went up there in the year. We've used the Oscar when he started a hock and about the Indians, you know. Maybe he's talking about the Cleveland and his probably in that Indian chick. Actually he didn't go up there right right. It was his daughter. I guess who shot or saw. It was his daughter. The Indian daughter. Oh, he has an Indian daughter right in the know that. Well he did. She started. I thought he wanted to send beefle up there. The Winnie song out about that. He said not a good idea. Beefle was on for Joe Rose this morning. The verdict around town is holy crap. What was that? Well that's always a pretty good idea. Gonna put the gun on seven to ten at night. So the first two days. I guess that's the way to introduce him to more people. The fact that Joe is the only one to go with not even silver there on seven 90. So they put him out in the morning for two days. And then he's going to be on seven to ten at night. See, I'm a strong believer. Put the people in their time. So I'm not going to be on a long day. For example, day we got Curtis Stevenson in Mad Dog spot, which is even a spot we want him in. Then we got Mohour David it in Mad Dog's desires five four to seven, which we don't want him in any spot from what I'm hearing. And then we got guilty at seven to ten. Which you know, but that's going to be quite a. What could be a great contest? It's the battle of the former worst team people. It'll be guilty at least seven to ten in that seven ten slide of night against default. I absolutely want a pub. I don't blame you with stiff competition like that. You're a good person to be a little ruggish. And loosely on by sixty in and. This is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority. Neil God. Oh, welcome back to the out. The out. Thank you. I am. Of course. The one and only. Out. Crank it. Up. Where broadcasting. The crime from the site of what used to be. The. Toots. Chores. Restaurant on West. Fifty seconds straight. A former watering hole for many famous celebrities. Such as Gerald Moore. And Carl Ballantine. Well, now. I'm not talking about. I'm not talking about. I only welcome you to stop by and say hello to one of my interns. I'm not thinking for. I'll put you in. See what that guy did. So go ahead. Here. Chock. I love this town. So I should tell you about my latest weekly book that I had my staff of 20 worship being in church right for me. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. I was in church. Oh, we have a very strong break here. We'll be back with more really great deal. 12 17 in the final 60. To pretty stiff composition there from Al Franken and Skier America. For the one point. Oh, yeah. And that keep in mind, two thirds, that was before the election. October November, or at least during that period of time. So you can only imagine one number of skier America's going through when you're like starting now. And American thick and hostage last year is shown to me for his life in a newly released video tape, but the video offers no clues as to when Roy Halm's Capers made the video, or whether he's still alive. And the video, a rifle barrel, is just inches from Halm's head as he says he worked with a American forces and was arrested by a resistance group in Iraq. Halm's and followed this were taken hostage in attacking Baghdad's Alman Surneber, or November 1. A security guard in one of about 20 attackers died in the gun battle. The kidnappers later released four captives, but kept Halm's in Filipino account Robert Tarngoy, Tarngoy. Also, it's worked for a Saudi-based company. The US State Department confirmed it in December the Halm's a 50-60-year-old father of two was taken. Halm's visibly nervous makes no demands in the 60-second video, but as for a help so I can be released as quickly as possible from this definite death. I'm not asking for any help from President Bush because I know of his selfishness and unconcern for those who've been pushed into this hellhole. He says, I'm asking for help from Arab rulers, especially President Mohm Arkinopi because he knows we're helping those who are suffering. He said, he also said, I'm dying out of the air. I don't, as the things are really going along very just stiffy. All we're flying, whatever to rack. And it's really interesting because they showed like about the minute of 10 Kennedy speech. They're continuing to miss nine hours. This anti-kind of leaves and stuff. And keep thinking of myself, you know, all of this is true. All of this was still true back before the end of the election, you know? But somehow you didn't get all of this across too well. Why? Especially especially, you're off on Kennedy. Yeah, the senator, the other senator from Massachusetts. How do you say that? Careful. Lee, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 in the Verizon, Sing it around a slime. WQA, and hello. WQA and hello.

You'll need it. Okay. Thanks. That's four miles where we used to be on the Beasley Station over there. And then they dropped all of us because they decided they could put on some broken programming a couple of preachers, a couple of stock market peddling, a phony baloney zon air. So we're not on over there anymore. Have been for a long time for two, three years. Anyway, let's see how happy they are. And they're very pleased about that because then they can't hear us ripping them and ask them if they can joys the answer to you deserve so badly. And the Beasley's for being a bunch of no-spick and mugwums who belong up in a tree with a banjo and deliverance. Can't hear that because that would get them really upset. Of course, if we signed those documents that Hank was talking about this morning, they could be fired at it and for that stuff. Because we don't want to cause any, you know, and if you could have heard the wording, I wish to know how I would have had the copy of what they were proposing. Oh, you would have believed it.

But Neil, I've never heard you react over a woman like this particular woman. What, what is it about her? That like compared to Combo, Elektra? No, no, I mean, you know, if you're wrong about that to Carmen Lector photos and I rave about those when we had him on the other side. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, you did. I mean, she's she's to me. She's about as close to perfection as you can get. Yeah, I agree. Yeah. I like Carmen Lector too, but I think of, you know, Dennis Rodden's real and the pilot hole and that's it. No, I'll just say that. No, no. Oh, okay. Bye. Ha ha ha. Yeah, he brings up a bit of a point that I dumped in anyway. I think your closet had a rope. Yeah, right. Oh, I got a queer eye for the, uh, hot, the chicks. What can I say? Yeah. So I mean, look, people who don't have any hangups about their own sexuality, they can be objective. Okay. So this business like like 95% of guys, this great guys were, oh, I don't know. But with God, couldn't tell you your full of crap. That's what I say. If I put a, if I put two plates on your dinner table and I put a beautiful rib eye steak on one and I put about a pound of dog crap on the other one. Oh, well, I can't tell which one looks better. It's just a matter of being able to see. It's just a matter of having a aesthetics. Yeah, it's a matter of deer's. Senses work. Okay. Now that doesn't mean everybody's going to have the same taste. But there are some people who are beyond, uh, cool. There's no question. Like Tom Brady, when he saves all light, smooths off, which he's doing at football. So I would, which is okay. Uh, when he saves off all the stuff, I'm going to, could anybody debate that he's a good looking guy? Josh? Huh? Yeah. See what I mean? Right there. That's exactly my point. I've never seen it. Get out of here. He's right. He's right in the wall behind you. There was a picture of Tom Brady with all his flashing 84 teeth. He's got as many teeth as a panoramic keys. Just the one with a shirt open over here. Now, it's a newspaper thing. The mad dog needs that to me a long time ago. It's the one in the wall. He's wearing a helmet. No, behind you. He's got like a suit on. He's not on the wall back there. Well, he, he's not on the wall back there. Well, he then, well, better be on the wall back there. Or I'm going to be down there like, uh, by seven o'clock color. Oh, right. Is that like white picture? Right. That's him. Yep. He's ready to have to. He's a great looking guy. And I Josh Cortis can't tell because he doesn't know. He's obviously, uh, you know, sexually confused. How could he not answer the question? Okay. Can't still turn away. I'm confused. No, I answer the question. What do you want me to say? Is that a case? It's a good looking guy. Okay. Yeah. I mean, what? You see what I mean? You made my point. It's just unbelievable. Like, like, I have a conference on this and see what's the reaction from the father's going to be. I'll be depending on what you say. He's a very handsome young man. Who can't see that? See, even a mad dog knows that. Hey, that's right. Yeah. Even a young, young, young. What is his life? Right. He has a stunt. There you go. Got to argue.

Yeah. Sure. Okay. Let me, are there any good looking guys? I don't know. Man, I'm not really, uh, no. They're not in here. You don't know. See, I can ask for a better man.

See, the day we find out two things about Josh, court. This number. What? He's a compulsive gambler. He's stood away on a cruise ship so he can get on a plunger's go out of the sea. He'll found that out from Hank. Number two, he's like, uh, maybe a closet case or something. Oh, yeah. Well, I mean, how is it possible that anybody could be in such not just denial, but like stubborn hysterical denial, like if you admitted that you could recognize, I mean, can you recognize an ugly guy, you know? What do you mean? Like, I'm supposed to walk that ship. Like, that's a really good looking guy. Oh, but you can't, you have supposed to be thinking that, but you can't tell like this guy's talking about my reaction to the pictures of Carmella this season. Okay. And there's no doubt that she's an absolute hot number. She's beautiful. She's a pristine man. She's gorgeous. Well, already, yes, we've all Tom Brady. You guys got millions. He's once and two.

President Bush's faith based initiative is proceeded largely under the radar. But lack of attention hasn't sealed in the program's constitution of questionability or its brutal effectiveness. In 2003, according to the White House data reported by the LA Times, Bush rolled out a billion dollars to hundreds of faith-based groups through a little note of the executive order. More importantly, the Bush administration used the grants to sway influential African-Americans in key battle around states and reward long time political supporters of taxpayer expense. For example, after the Reverend Herbert Lustus II delivered the invocation of the 2000 Republican Convention, his Philadelphia Church received a million dollars in federal funds. Bishop Harold Ray, who offered the invocation of the rally for Dick Taney and Palm Beach, at 1.7 million for his south-load of industry. In 2002, Bush personally visited Milwaukee's Bishop Sedgwik Daniels who loaded for Clinton and Gore and later awarded him a one-and-a-half-minute dollar grant. This fall, Daniels faced a period on Republican party flyers in Wisconsin, endorsing Bush's a man who shares our views. The faith-based initiative likely played a crucial role in increasing Bush's take at the black vote, especially in targeted swing states. Suddenly enough, the campaign held grant writing workshops in St. Louis and September when Missouri was still in play in Miami, October. Moreover, a set of theories actually how much money money is going where. The recent White House data concludes a caveat that it represents all grants. Even the Reverend Sun Young Loone's cult of unification church has received funding, and House Republicans allegedly blocked the Maccret Chet Edwards from investigating the money flow. When the initiative's first director, John DeUlio resized after six months on the job, he called the White House policy makers, Maybur and Mackey or Vellies, who consistently talked in acted as if the height of political sophistication, considered reducing aviation with simplest black and white terms for public consumption, then stealing legislative initiatives are a policy proposal as far-right as possible. Bush plans to highlight the initiative in knowing how we did, and a stadium address, and we introduced the expanded legislation before the New Republican Congress. The number one Maybur and Mackey Vellie keeps confusing wholly work with partisan data. There we did there. The window care about that because we absolutely know where they're coming from. They're coming from the Lord, man. They are divinely inspired these folks. God told them to do it, right? Go up there and spread freedom of Shonda march all over the place. That's correct. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Towns I don't think anybody's going to catch Vellie House John Wayne doing this. He's moving up at all or what? Vellie's got 65. Charles Bronson 34.

I mean, do he spit this much time, or can the damn educational system? So, there's dollars, there's a dollar. I mean, no, what about our educational system, there's the governor? What about our healthcare system? Okay, this lady's going to die for crying out. What? Come on, ladies. Go vote for him again. Okay. Everybody's too late now. Nobody could in their right mind.

You wouldn't watch him movie with Cory Hames. Not seen a few unfortunately, but that's not Cory Melvin. Not Cory Feldman. They're all about the government. They're not discussing you, bro. There's a good question for Josh. Who's better looking? Cory Hames or Cory Feldman. Now, just write those down. We don't want to answer on here because we'll be incremented. You're racing.

The 10 worst corporations of 2004. Mark these down. Okay, avoid them like to play. Okay. When the multinational monitor judges, Gandalf had picked the 10 worst corporations of the year one of their instructions is name no companies that appeared on the previous years list, borrowing extraordinary circumstances. For 2004, that means no bear. Even though in 2004, the company pushed for imported genetically modified rice and the EU, polluted water and a South African utility carcinogen, textile, and chromium. And was hit with evidence that its payment occasionally leave, increases the risk of hard attack among other egregious acts. No bullying despite new evidence that the tanker plane scandal cost you as taxpayers, tens of billions of dollars even worse than it appeared. And no clear channel, even though the radio behemoth in 2004, stoop to new lows with a breast Christmas ever contest that promised to pay for breast implants for dozen contest winners. And know how a burden and broden a whole new set of contracting, fraud and bribery charges last year. But at least it will repeat rule helps them at the field a bit. And there were many plenty of worthy candidates of the remaining pool of price gougers, polluter and union vusters, dictator codlers, fraudsters, prisoners, poisoners, deceivers and general miscreens, we choose the following. Pretty in alphabetical order is the 10 worst corporations of 2004. Abbott Laboratories, Abbott makes the list for raising the price of Norvier and important needs drug, developed for the major infuse of US government funds by 400%. The price increased didn't apply if Norvier is purchasing in the conventional other Abbott drug, giving it an unfair advantage over competitors, and tilting consumers to use the Abbott products on the basis of price. AIG. The world's largest insurer American international group, Inc. AIG, which charges an October with aiding in a bidding, PNC financial services, and a fragile entranse act to transfer $750 million in mostly trouble loans and venture capital investments from subsidiaries off its books. AIG agreed to pay $1256 million to resolve the charges, but it got off light, entering into a deferred prosecution agreement, meaning the charges against the company will be dropped in 12 months, if it abides by the terms of agreement. Coca-Cola. Workers have to co-op bottling planning Columbia have been terrorized for years by right wing parliamentary forces. A fact-finding mission headed by a new or city council member found among other abuses, there have been a total of 179 major human rights violations of Coca-Cola's workers including nine murders. Family members of union activists have been abducted and tortured. Coaxes that opposes the anti-union violence and in any case that it has that control of the bottling plant that would does, and now after purchasing the Columbia bottling company, co-scorber general council in the former system US Attorney General devolved Patrick resigned in 2004, reportedly in Part because Coax Coax refuses to support an independent investigation into the Columbia investigations. Vow Chemical. The world's largest plastic maker dot purchased union per by 1999, and midnight on December 2nd, 84, 27 tons of lethal gasses late for muting per by its pesticides, in fact, we involve Paul India immediately killing an estimated 8,000 people and poisoning thousands of others. Today in Bob Paul released 150,000 people including children born to parents who survived the disaster, are suffering from a sport related health effect such as cancer, neurological damage, chaotic menstrual cycles, and mental illness. That refuses to take any responsibility and the statement the company says although down never owned or operated the plant we along with the rest of the industry have learned from this tragic event and we've tried to do all we can to assure that similar incidents never have an again. Glaxo Smith Klein. Following revelations and regulatory action in the UK in 2003 and 4, the story of these severe side effects of Glaxo's Paxville, as well as other drugs in the same family, notably that they were significantly to increase to a sideality and youth, finally broke the day in the US in 2004. In June, New York Attorney General Elliott Spitzer filed suit again Glaxo charging the giant drug maker with suppressing evidence of Paxo's harm to children misleading physicians. Glaxo denied the charges but appealed to the new system where it would make public results of all its clinical trials. In October, the US Food and Drug Administration Nordic Glaxo and Makers had drugs and Paxville's Pax to include a black box warning, the agency strongly is with their pills. You know, like that's gone across most things. Right? What about it? So, think of that. Heartys. The fast food maker is bragging about how on a healthy it's latest culinary invention the monster of thick burger. First, there were burgers, then there were thick burgers. Now, heartys is introducing the mother of all burgers the monster of thick burger weighing in at 2-3rds of a pound. This is how to present angus beef burger is the monument to decadence. The monster thick burger is a 1420 calorie sandwich. Eating one thick burger is like eating two big max or five McDonald's hamburgers and 600 calories worth of heartys fries and you get more than 2,000 calories that many people should eat in the whole day. A quite a Michael Jacobson will be sent her for a science in the public interest who calls the thick burger food porn. Oh, in that case, we like it. Oh, oh. Merk. Dr. David Graham, an FDA drug safety official, calls it maybe the single greatest drug safety catastrophe in the history of this country. Testify before a Center Committee in November, Dr. David Graham put the number in the US with separate heart attacks with stroke as a result of taking the arthritis drug viox in the range of 88,139,000. As many as 40% of these people were about 35 to 55,000 died as a result. The Archceptible Cardiovascular risk of Ix were evident as early as 2000. A full four years before the drug was finally withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer Merk. A friend of a study released by the Lancet Be British Medical Journal, Merk says it just goes all relevant evidence on Viox safety as soon as it acquired it, and pulled the drug as soon as it took inclusive evidence to the drug's dangerous. Right. McWain. McWain Inc. Is that how to do with Wayne Heizing? I wonder. McWain is a large privately held Alabama based sewer and water pipe manufacturer in a devastating series. The New York Times revealed the companies agreed to safety record and the other failure of regulatory agencies to control the company's workplace violence. Nine McWain employees have lost their lives and workplaces since 1995, and three of the deaths were the result of deliberate company violations of safety standards. More than 4600 injuries were recorded among the company's 5000 employees, according to the Times McWain pulled the wool over the Eisen investigators by stalling them at the factory gates and the hiding defective equipment. Accidents sites were already before investigators could inspect them in violation of federal rules. When government enforcement officials did find series violations of the Times reported, the punishment meeting out by the federal government was so minimal that McWain could treat it simply as they cost of doing business. Riggs Bank and Explosive Report from the U.S. Senate Permanent Semck Committee on Investigations of the Committee of Government Affairs in June July revealed that the Washington D.C. based Riggs Bank illegally operated bank accounts for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinnichred and routinely ignored evidence of corrupt practices and managing more than 60 accounts for the government of Equatorial Guinea. Can we say Guinea on here? Not anymore. Although these nether activities seem to violate U.S. Banking rules, the officer to control the currency did not take enforcement action against the bank after alerted these matters in 2002. That presumably was not unrelated in fact that the O.C. C. Examinator had raised soon thereafter went to work for Riggs. In May 2004, the bank paid $25 million in fines of connection with money laundering violations related to the Equatorial Guinea and Saudi Arabian governments, the Saudi Arabian government is the subject to ongoing federal criminal investigations. And last, but not least, you're very favorite. Yeah, a Walmart. There you go. Sorry. Are you studying the killing the Medi-Belligan over there? The get them lined up against me?

While Walmart is personally out of it of a public relations defensive, the company remains the colossus of U.S. and increasingly global retailing. It registers more than a quarter trillion dollars in sales. It's revenues account for 2% of U.S. gross domestic product for 2 years running, 14 is named Walmart the most admired company in America. It's arguably the defining company of the present era. A key component arguably the key component of the company's business model is under compensating employees in an externalizing cost on the society. A February 2004, a British invited by Representative George Miller, California, tabulated some of those costs. The report estimates that 1,200 first of all, Mark Sturmary was under the cost of federal taxpayers of over $420,000 a year about $2,903 per employee. These public costs include free and reduced lunches for just 50 qualifying Walmart families, Section 8 Housing Assistance, federal tax credits, and deductions for low income families, and federal contributions health insurance programs for low income children. Well, not great. We're helping out those poor banks. We work for Walmart. And for me, they need your help. Josh court says he likes to throw in a few bucks. I've got a better idea.

Authority said yesterday they're investigating leaks about the child molestation case against Michael Jackson that appeared in news reports. Santa Barbara County Sheriff's official statement from agent about the case has been released and defines the Bay Judges gag order imposed on both sides. We consider the release of these materials to be a violation of law according to a statement posted on the Department's website. Some media commentators have a lens that we are responsible for these least we are not. These accusations are irresponsible, unfounded, and untrue. Sheriff Sergeant Chris Papas declined to elaborate. Suddenly the gag order. The online statement was in part of response to the recent ABC news report that quoted from the transcripts of Grand Dury testimony given in the molestation case. And that testimony Jackson's accused of described the pop singers' alleged crimes in graphic detail, including an incident which Jackson allegedly molested him on a bed. ABC is not revealed how it received more than 1900 pages of Grand Dury testimony. Grand Dury transcript normally are made public in California. 10 days after the pandemic receives him. But the judge in the Jackson case has kept the transcript. See it long with most other documents. The judge in the case has been reported. The judge in the case has been reported.
