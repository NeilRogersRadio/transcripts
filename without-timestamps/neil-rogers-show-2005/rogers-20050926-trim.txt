How it things? Everything is great. Yeah, I mean too. This is a clean thing. How about those Patriots? Holy cow, what again? That Brady is amazing, isn't he? Yeah, 12 for 12 in the fourth quarter. Yeah, chips are down. Him and Vennetary, man. Those two got balls of granite. Yep. No question about that. But guy is now brought his team back in the fourth quarter, 17 times in his right. And he's so cool back there. You know, does he just carve them up unfazed? Yes. Don't be fooled by the pretty face folks. Somebody called the show earlier and said, oh, they're still. We should have taken a time at the ice-binaterial. Yeah, right. Like that guy. Right. Like that guy is an automatic. Whoever the clown was on the broadcast was saying the same thing. Oh, well, I could have, you know, like it's going to make any difference. One way or the other. Yeah, that's so. You don't ice-anomenetary. Nope. And of course, the dolphins were smelling super bowl, man. Oh, yeah. This is the overall reacting town on earth. You know, last week, Ronnie Brown was a bomb now. He's, you know, it's always a bad sign when your team wins a game and you act like you're really shocked that they want. That's not a good sign. And, well, I was shocked that they won yesterday. Look, like Carolina's highly overrated. They stuck against the whirlwinds. They played very poorly against the Patriots. They played the worst that game. But they're not playing well. They actually could have won the game. And, you know, they came back. They tied it and they're moving again. They get to the dollar. They're on the worthy of life. They're on the worthy of life. They go, but he throws that interception. Well, you know, it goes for Ronnie Brown. What's not to like, you know? It goes to that a good second. Have you just three for the world? It goes for the world. It goes for the world. It goes for the world. It goes for the world. It goes for the world. It goes for the world. It goes for the world. And of course, the marlins are just, I guess everybody will be in the dolphin bandwagon. badly. They're going out and, you know, what do you think they want in style? You know, give it a good shot. They're going out in shame. That cookie crumbled. Yeah. So, well, the last week of the marlins season and they are suddenly irrelevant. Oh, that means we got no more 12, 30 early exits. That's bad. I'm going to have better take a vacation pretty soon. Make up for that. I'm going to have about two weeks. Yeah. I'm out of here on Thursday after the show Thursday. I'm really going in the York. That's the point. The gold cup at Bellmont on Saturday. Yeah. I'm going to get the gold Charlotte on Monday. I'm covering the Monday night game for ESPN. Will I be damned? Charlotte. Well, that's not a mine Charlotte. I like it there. Never been there. Oh, it's a nice little city. I've driven to the Carolina's on 95 years ago, but I always drove real fast to there. Oh, I like to Carolina's. Really? Yeah, I went to school. What? I've always liked it there. That's right. You went to Duke. Yeah. Holy moly. Hey, and by the way, speak out of college. You just have about those Spartans. Yeah. What's that all about? Something. It's Illinois. Yeah. It's the seventh. A whole bunch. Well, they're pissed off. They're sick and tired of taking all that crap from those mechigan people. I wasn't a good day for them. Don't tell me they lost again. Mechigan? Yeah. Yep. I'll tell you. I'm awesome. A worse possible way, too, at the end of the game. Oh, no. Somebody may be a real upset to say. I would think so. You're not going to be happy. You're not going to be happy. You're buddy back in town or is he still a fan of you? I didn't really check his itinerary. I keep him any answers out of these people. You know, whether it's about my paycheck, whether it's about his my good buddy, mobile back in time. Yes, he's so happy and excited that most are going to be back in town. Right. And he wasn't sure that he was. Oh, that's a shock. Yeah. See there you go again. How far were you if you're leaving after Thursday showed it in the York. All right. These next four days. I keep my nose real clean. Do you know what I mean? Oh, you mean? Peabell? Yeah. No more peabell. This week. You have four days to hang on real tight. I've been pretty good. I've been in the last nine men. Findberg. Whatever his name is. What a jackass. So we're the other place I would come and ask for four hours. I think on and off on Friday. I'll actually do it again today. I'm going to agree with you on that. Yeah. That's a jerk. Yeah. Do you know if you were able to do anything to hurt us? It would be almost amusing if we're for the fact that he tried to hire you and Maydog and everybody on the staff except me. Yeah. And then, you know, we'd like to get Joe back. But oh no. He's not going. He hates Q. You know, so everybody hates Q. I'm going to play something about Joe. Joe does not hate Q. Yeah. No, no. He hates two people. They're one of them is Greg and the other one is so, so he's going to be unmentsible along. Yeah. And I think Joe dislikes more people over there than he does over here. Wouldn't surprise me. Like maybe Dan LaBaster is one. I'm here. That could be one. Yeah. They're others. Well, I don't think he and Defoe ever get along that well either. I don't think he has a lot of respect for the general manager. The stew guys probably not. That's your form of bird off here. Your responsibility. Are you made him what he is today? Yeah. A guy with the rich daddy. I didn't make him that. Board of Made General Manager. Boy, what a market. You know what? It's like the story. I told you about how the Howard Primer from KFC. I've heard of that story on there. Remember about how he was going to get fired. Yeah. And the PD left. Yeah. He was sitting in the hallway. He had to go in thinking that he was going to get a promotion in the news department. And the city was going to get fired. And the PD walked in just before him. And I can't take this place out of here. And so, Judith, what's that was their name from Nevada the center? Whatever the name was. Actionner? I was an extrader Campbell. Yeah. And she calls Howard and says, how would you like to be program director? He just happened to be the first available body. He also had a rich daddy who bought that station. Yeah. And turned into Haitian melodies. Well, Sydney tell us that they say hello. Oh, yeah. Give him a big kiss for me. Thanks, Sydney. How is he? He's great. He's doing fine. He's living a good life right now. It's good to have time in North Carolina. You're talking about Lynn Russell to him? I will mention that to him next time. Yeah, just he would he says. Okay. Well, he pretended when he and Craig Worthing and I had dinner at Ruth Chris year two ago. He pretended at least he put on a good act. Like Alzheimer's was kicking in. I don't remember anything about any of that, you know, about Lynn. But nevertheless, trying to remember Judith's last name now. Yeah, the city has been with the center of Nevada. Howard something. And I can't think of her name. To begin with L. I don't start with that. I have no idea. I haven't got a clue. It wasn't cats and time. I can tell you that. No. Now were you ever in that building? Did you ever share? You know, music was was in the same building. In fact, they owned a building. And it was my friend Mike Perl's family was the music. People, they were the music people down here. Yeah, yeah, the franchise for down here. So I used to go over there all the time. In fact, I used to go in that building and sit with Sunny. Why do this show at night? So you were in the, well, where did he even do a show out of the main studio, though? He didn't get his own studio. He did? Oh, I don't know. I was a big studio. Yeah, that was it. And there was the big picture of Frank Cassen-Tine who was the father. He was named after him after his name. And there was a big picture on the wall. I still do this day swear that as you looked at it, the eyes were moving. It was watching you. He'd been dead for years. But there was a big picture on the big eye. The best story is with, with, with, with, Sidney and Mrs. Cassen-Tine. The day that you and the warm Sidney, he were going to go out on the air. Yeah. And he kept her on the phone for hours. Four hours show. So if you wouldn't listen to that, it was a classic. And it's a true story. Oh, boy. Those are the days, man. Those were the days. Just a couple old guys reminiscing. That's us. It's a bird bath out there outside of window. That room was like, it was like a mussely in that studio. With those old drapes and that big piano in there. That was a boy. Oh, yeah. I remember it. And then the transmitter was inside the building, which is very unusual. The tower is sitting out back. And the transmitter was inside the building in the control room. And I used to have those real. It was older than Methuselah. Art Smith was the engineer. I'm sure he's the long since pushing up daisies. But we had those big glowing final tubes. He'd go in there looking at it. What was like, Mark Coney would have been proud. It was just amazing. What a place. Yeah. That was quite a time. Yeah. Those are the daisies, man. Yeah. Well, we're still doing it. We had that. What was the sales manager's name that died too from a Notre Dame? Oh, wow. Wow. I didn't know he died. He died. Oh, a long time ago. In fact, his son called me on the air years ago. And on this station about four or five years ago again. He was in the top. He was in the top. Bob Allen? Yeah. That's so nice. Or that Jewish station. We don't want to be that Jewish station. We're in the second part of these old Jews. We don't want to be that Jewish. Well, he was a Notre Dame guy. Oh. Oh, that Catholic thing. I don't know. But he used to shoot some mean baskets in his office though. He wanted those little mini basketballs. Yeah. Oh, I got, I could, you're right. I should write a book. The only problem is nobody buy it. But I would amuse a hell out of me. And you. And me. Yeah. And George. Probably not Greg. But that's the way it goes. I'm seeing Greg lately. Well, that's good. Well, he's leaving. He's probably making his plans now to move on. We're not bored. You know. I don't want to discuss that. No, that's good. I do a time to leave. Probably not. I'm not treading that direction. Good time to leave and go. But yeah. It's not a bad idea. Yeah. Go plunge your guts out. Okay. I might, I'll say how do you, I'll say how do you buddy on the cross over it too. I can move a bit kiss for you. Oh, please. And the best of you. Back to him right on the. Okay. See you tomorrow. All right. Yeah. I gave the command to kill thousands of innocent people. I said fill her up. I helped raise money to buy explosives for a suicide bomber. But it was just so I could drive to my in-laws for Thanksgiving. I helped ship rocket launchers to Islamic fundamentalists in the Philippines. But it was only good fun. It was just cruising to the beach. I helped provide cash to train terrorists. But all I was doing was topping off my tank before my ski trip. If you think your addiction to using gasoline in your car isn't causing any harm. Think again. Because the money you spend to feel your tank eventually goes to fill the pockets of terrorists. I gave the command to kill thousands of innocent people. And all I had to say was fill her up. Some other public service announcements want to blame terrorism on drug addicts. But we want to let people know that it's gasoline that fuels terror. So whether you're sticking a straw in your nose or a nozzle in your tank, you're part of the problem. I was just out for a Sunday drive. It's not like I was hurting anyone. This message provided by the council on displacing the blame. I think it was there for well-bored shoes. Just trying to keep her nose clean. That's right. That was the last straw. No, well, by the way, speaking to that, you know, they had volume for column by on CBC last night. Didn't believe how many the words by the way. Totally the effort was in several times un-experigated. They just to show the original version. And I had to watch it again. You've not seen it many, many, many, many times. And the point I think of that movie that's the best. And of course it's so true now is the idea of keeping the public scared. Oh, yeah. To mean things. Keep everybody on pins and you'd like more scared. Like the power of night bears. Exactly. And in line with that, I got a little story a little bit later about the newest, The Nile Monitor Lizard. Have you seen about this? No. What a nasty. What is a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more of a little bit more. I've seen them. What do you call it? What do you call it? What are the little comedians that run around all over in the backyard? A here in Florida, Lizard. Yeah. What? Lizard. No, but they have a name for those. Get it. Get it. Like little, they're a tough small and harmless. This is a big meaner. A mother looks like a serious dark thing. It's a sharp tooth invasive reptile. And it's into Florida. And it may make its way to, wow. Wow. So there's another reason. There. Good. I've been a total panel. What was it? Good. Eight bugs. And other little bugs. And also little babies too. So all you people are reproducing a little bit too much. Just say your baby's out in the front lawn. See what happened. Anyway, our poor. I'll be before we do the pool. Here's some more good news from Iraq and Afghanistan. A suicide bomber, driving a mini bus, pulled alongside a convoey of elite Iraqi Commandos in Baghdad yesterday. And detonated as explosive coming 10 more people in the spare burning metal. The parfors explosion rattled when goes miles from the stretch of high wind, the eastern neighborhood of Guadier blood from the dead and injured soaked the bread in the roadside stalls. Isn't that lovely? Yeah. Blood soaked bread. I bet you they get a discount on that. Or chart extra. And a US to new helicopter crash yesterday where what mountains and some of that can stand killing all five crew members on board, the US military said it didn't appear to have been shot down. It was just an accident. But then somebody got his as opposed to accidents where nobody got hurt. So I guess we were just kind of like a big disappointment. They were hoping for like a lot of dead bodies and chaos and Katrina part two. But it just didn't pan out just flooding. I mean, it did plenty of damage, but not like the big league. And so last night, MSNBC had a big special on there. And there was a little Brian Nourcrasse was getting all kinds of kudos and about how he saved all these lives during Andrew and how brilliant he was. And he's the guy to throw. I told George before to show it's like chicken little. You know, if he keeps screaming long enough, the sky's flying sooner or later something does happen. So nice going Brian. I want to give you the real thing. Yeah, not a lot of it. They went up for that asteroid. So anyway, who's the best American rock band of all time? We had tremendous response. The only promise are about 300. We have freaked on this pool. And if I'm not going to notice it, right? You, if you want to waste your time creeping our pools by all means, have a good time. It'll keep your Earth screen. Because obviously, you have no life. 20, 823 votes have worked about 2500 similar real votes. That's pretty impressive. Ask me, we might actually have somebody out there listening Joel. Wouldn't that be bad if we two in another big month in Europe? Salvation is a really pretty good summer book. Oh, no. The best American rock band of all time. I think because there's so many of money here because we need what are we going to do with that journey thing. Stick them down there. Like what about the like it matters. I've all been right down there with readly of Ramones. You know what I mean? Isn't like this. This is Neil Rogers. This is five 16. 15. This. Come on. What's very funny? Here's my story said by true. Oh, I hear. A better girl calls to find her soul. Had a bug and ran it around. Give it to every guy in town. Hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey. Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. We didn't get enough to go! No, I'm afraid it's falling off you, the world's falling apart From a guy who's gone, you just have a hole Where there's fog and a hole, and getting through that She haven't known, but keep away from a simple ensuyer Get away from that girl! You know, I'm sure you've seen people in your lifetime Horace, so beautiful that it hurts to look at them, you know what I mean? Oh yeah. I think everybody can relate to that. There's people that you almost can't even look at them Because it's just like, it would be like being diabetic And too much eye candy in the garlic. Garlic, yes. Huh? Scarlett Joe Hanson. And I think even Joshua to be with me, that yesterday in the Patriots Steelers game The Tom Brady looks so good, that it was... What? Yeah, Joe Hanson. Joe Hanson. It was difficult for me to look at him. That's how good he looks now. I don't know what it is, but it's like he's going to go well whatever. Joshua, to say that same thing this morning. Yeah, I heard him. We probably thought I wasn't paying attention, but he said the same. And of course he's busy on Gloteney as Boxer 3 in the... Oh! There you go, nice going. Yeah, pretty sure, you know, better than the Path right now. Hey, give a little bit of credit, Mr. That was one hell of a gaming yesterday that Patriots Steelers game. I walked in the Pittsburgh. Huh? I watched it. 12 for 12 at a fourth quarter. And inventory is solid. Brock's solid. Is it a block of granite? They are just at their back. And of course those dolphins, well, what can you say? Oh man. Yeah. Oh, and I'm sorry. It was a premature vaguation on my part. Three more US soldiers were killed back today. In two separate attacks involving Worldside Boms, one of the attacks occurred early and the day in Western Baghdad, killing two. The 30 US soldiers were working with a 47th Brigade with Scoda by 50 miles on east of Baghdad. Yesterday, and this is over in above here. The story I had before about the 10. See, people think that, you know, there's like one story. And oh, well, that's just nicely related into, you know, what's the 10 dead rat heads? Usually at least 33 more raties were killed during a day of step of violence. Gunman, Royal Doretical, Shea, Curec, Mooktana, Al-Sadarambus, and Iraqi patrol, Eastern Baghdad, Slum, and US forces joined in a 90-minute gun battle, killing as many as 80 of the attackers. But 33 raties were killed there. And also yesterday, armed men pulled off during armored car robber, killing two guards and escaping with $850,000 on a suicide car bomber, slender into a conboard carrying in tear ministry, commandos, killing seven of them in two civilians, and south of the capital, two separate bicycle bombings in town markets, killed at least seven more people, and wounded dozens. Other than that, everything is just all we're for. I, if you would say it's Oki-Doki, you see, freedom of your heart. Everything is just fine, so quit making up all those stories. Okay, the best rock band of all time, American. Now, journey, if you believe this, which we don't cause it was free. Every 65, so we'll take 300 out of it. Let's give them 65, okay? And again, whoever would, I mean, have all the bands to free. Right? Journey, my ass. The door is 275. It was, look at this. See, instead of wasting your hosts with freeping, you couldn't have been the incisive votes, but you weren't, because you're too busy with a bunch of smart asses. The door is 275. The eatals, 273. Are you ready for that? An aerosmith, 253. Holy, moly, ratman, and even Van Halen, the marginal Van Halen 209. Oh, and did you notice that Howard's voice was on that Connecticut school of broadcasting spot? It was brought to our attention. Speaking of David Lee Growth, Roth, who was rumored to be a replacement Howard. Soon. These boys, 125. Greatful dead 105, how's that?

I should play laughing just for her laughing. No. Oh, they guess who's sorry. Hey, I'm on the bat. Love and spoonful was. You didn't have to do something. You didn't have to. You guys don't know what. People even imagine. There was a bringer. Did you ever have to make up the way they did it? Yeah, that's a pretty big picture. And then of course, here's the word that everybody knows. Even Josh might know this one. Since it's a. It's a separate. It's a separate part. Yeah. I know that. Everybody knows.

Oh, there he is. 376 votes on our poll today. The biggest we've done this long time ago. Although I think the results are changing now because the people that love it there. They don't want any part of this show. We're too negative. And I'm too honest. I mean, too negative. 1076 votes. The biggest problem of San Francisco is the Cubans 95. The Cubans Cuban. No, no. I'm sure he's so good. I'm sure he's still dead. I'm a time-sharfer still dead. That was something about the reminiscent with Hank about KAT. I'm sure the audience went into a coma but you know what, we enjoyed it. We don't care. We enjoyed it. And Joel is over there dancing different up and down. Oh, no. I'm not going to let their all eyes old use. They're over there. We're going to say it about, oh, no. Nobody wants to hear that. We'll grab you. They do. They love it. They want to hear about the old KAT days. They want to hear about something with when radio was a radio. I suppose to this crap we got now. Garbage. Just absolute swill. If I have to read one more story about John Hogan and Clear Channel was doing this and Clear Channel was doing it. You know, my friend Derek is right. John Hogan sucks. And I'm not talking about the driver from the window and I'm talking about John Hogan, the CEO from Chief Channel. The people that are basically destroying this business. And if I get any more of those insight, did you call Tom Taylor by the way, Josh, please? Sure. Get around of that. No, seriously. They came. They opened two accounts instead of one for me number one. They were going to be a big deal. They were going to be a big deal. They were going to be a big deal. They were going to be a big deal.

I think I should probably tell a story about my high pitched tonight is called what a sort of bus start. Oh, it's a good story. Yeah, it's perfectly taken to turn with it. It's my long Saturday night. I come into my place here and I hear in my living room I hear this high pitched tone. Do we have like a 60 cycle tone we used to have some like that? Yeah, well the the bleep is just a shortened tone. No, no, no, no. Much higher pitched than that. I mean, yeah, like that only. I like that only much higher and much. And I'm here and I'm thinking, okay, what the hell's it? It's not to drive you crazy if they would log dogs in this building. If I had a dog, he would like jump out the window, kill the toe. That's all high. It wasn't annoying. And I'm thinking, well, where the hell's that coming from? So I was the first thing you think of as your TV, right? Right. Turn the TV off still there. Right. Then come here and go on around and I'm listening to my air purifier. Not coming from that. And I'm like trying to position myself in different places and I go on other rooms in my place here. And in the studio, here, do I hear it? No, in my bedroom, do I hear it? No, Pat rooms. No. And so this is very, just concerning. If you're well, something in the building or somebody either left a client sign or something's going on. Or maybe from the fire alarm. So I get up yesterday morning and the same damn high pitched tone. And then you start worrying about, you know, it's pretty when you get to be an old Jew like me about tonight. Is it all, you know, is that what they call it? Yeah, tonight is tennis, I'm not sure how it's going to happen. When you have always hearing those high pitched tone in your ears and it's just it's in your head. You know, it's just in your head. Yeah, like that. Yeah, very similar to that, only without the wobble. But anyway, that's all right. So yesterday, I went downstairs. I had to go to the store, get a couple of things. And on the way out, I told the concierge. I said, would you send the maintenance guy up because there's some, and the maintenance guy comes up here. And sure enough, he's listening. He hears it. He hears it. So I know it's not me. I'm not losing my mind. I mean, at least somebody else heard it. So he, uh, he's going to go check it out. Yeah, and the worst part of it is that when I go down a hallway, I go to the elevator. I hear it in the elevator. Yeah. And then I get to the bottom of the elevator. And I hear it down there. So I'm positive at this point. It's something in the building and something in the air conditioning system and the, uh, something. I don't know. Your fillings are picking up radio signals. Right. So I come back and at this point, I pick up my blackboard and I send a message to a friend of mine was in the building. I said, come on up. I want to see if you can hear this because it's driving me crazy. And maybe even figure out what it is. And he sends me back a message. He'll be up in a few minutes. And I, as I pick up the blackboard or read it, I realize that this high pitch tone is coming from my little blackberry. I mean, from such a little thing, I can make a name like that. You know, I'm so pervert. I know how to learn. Seriously. Uh, and of course, as I was going down in the elevator, I carried this everywhere. So it was in my pocket. Even though it was in the off position turned off, it still was making that noise. See what I'm saying? Right. So the button. So the base of the elevator is I still heard it. And of course, because it was in my pocket, you more on you idiot. So I take this thing out. I realize as I hold it up that it's making this sound. So I open it up with a knife. Took the battery out, re-inserted it and here it is right here. You hear it? No, because it's not quite a church knife. I thought I would blow it up. Wow. So there's like a little interesting story. And of course, the madening part when you hear something like that, you know, where it's coming from? And then it follows you around. And you convince that you're like losing your mind. That you have great read disease. That he's finally gotten to you. I got to get to meet Greg. Well, it's big enough. Greybrowvers by the way these Saudis. I just don't know what to tell to say. I'm going to let's get him all. You ragheads. I know that we have a few people probably American troops. Listen to an over there in Saudi Arabia. Hey, you guys over there. Just go and hook the old cheer to the oil. And let's have a bloodless cool. Even a bloody cool is okay with me as long as there are people on it. Those ragheads, Saudi princes, man. You're your time is coming, baby. This reminds me of Josh's favorite movie network. This story that you somebody sent to us, right? Saudi Prince Al-Walib bin Talal has purchased 5.46% of the Fox Corporation. According to Gulf Daily News, raising concern that the conservative Fox News may soften its anti-terrorist stance due to the views of the new shareholder. Al-Walib, the nephew of the late Saudi king, Fad, was in the news when he visited the World Trade Center's remains just after the 9th of the 9th of the text. And offered then the U.S. city mayor Rudy Giuliani, a 10 million dollar check for relief news, Al-Walib then released a statement blaming U.S. foreign policy and support for Israel for the attacks. Giuliani returned the princess check with a statement that there's no more equivalent for this attack. The people who did it lost any right to ask for justification when they started innocent people. Not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem. So there's one raghead okay. So now one part of Fox News is that we didn't hit Fox News enough already. Now, God only knows as they said network work kind of crap is going to be penal for truth on that network. As if it is right. And if you didn't like that story about our for a Saudi friends, you'll love this one. All right. More. The Saudis and the Bush's man, they're in bed together. That's why they hold hands, you know? All right. Jent, hold hands because they're in bed together, literally and figuratively, you name it. They're doing it. The Bush's end have been laden's. Punk, buck, buddies. You know, they have that piece. Did you see it on 60 minutes last night about the search for bin Laden? No, I missed it. What a waste of time. Well, we're not going to find bin Laden. We got a football game on every time I tried to tune in. Well, that was a Patriot Steelers game with some kind of about 737 and don't be knocking that. Okay. That was Mooye and Portante, very important. If you say so. I'm telling you right now, man, Tom Brady was in it. Oh, he sure looked good yesterday. I mean, how does Josh that? Yeah, Josh, you just astonished. Anyway, of course, the reason they're Josh probably a buck span, he got that young good looking coach, you know. Was that so young anymore? That young buck? Yeah, young buck. Hey, buck. What is that bit? Oh, that's that, uh, uh, they're all strawberry bits. Yeah. Hi, buck. President Bush decided last week to wait. Listen to this carefully. Okay, to give an idea to kind of crap. And it gets very, this is from the British newspaper, the Guardian. I didn't read anything about this in my scouring all the other 80,000 websites. President Bush decided last week to wait any financial sanctions on Saudi Arabia, Washington's closest era of ally and war on terrorism. For a minute, isn't that ironic? Yeah. That we like saying that my relanski was our closest ally in the war against the mob. For a family of doing stuff to stop the modern day slave trade in prostitutes, child sex workers and forced laborers. In June, the state department listed 14 countries is failing to adequately address trafficking problems, subject to them all to possible sanctions if they didn't crack down. Of those 14, Bush concluded that Bolivia, Jamaica, Qatar, Sudan, Togo and the United Arab Emirates had made enough improvements to avoid any cut in USAID. Or in the case of countries that get no American financial assistance, the barren of their officials from cultural and educational events to Darla Jordan, the state department spokeswoman. Cambodia and Venezuela were not considered to have made so radical improvements. Hey, Hugo, how are you doing? But both clear them nonetheless to receive limited assistance for such things as combating trafficking. In the case of in a Thuella, which has the tense relationship with the US and the leadership of a person in the Hugo Chavez, a Hugo. One of Latin America's most recent spoken critics of the US foreign policy, Bush also allowed funding for strengthening the political party system and supporting electoral observations so we can overthrow a huge Chavez, just like in Guadalda, the Indian, and showing all the other ones. In addition to Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Kuwait, another US ally in the Middle East, were given a complete pass on any sanctions. Saudi Arabia, Ecuador and Kuwait, despite periodic differences, oil, red Saudi Arabia and the US have a tight alliance built on economic and military cooperation. That left Myanmar, which we used to know is Burma, Osol, Farts, Cuba and North Korea's the only nations in the list of 14, Varg, completely from receiving certain kinds of foreign aid. Cuba, Cuba, Cuba, you got it? Is not it? It's not a good cutting off for any assistance or humanitarian aid. The White House statement offered no explanation of why countries were regarded differently, Jordan also could not provide one. As many as 800,000 people are bought and sold across national borders annually or learned other countries with false promises to work rather than if it's a credit for the state of our most or women in children. But the Saudis are okay because the Saudis, those ragheads, those grave robbers, those courts, or a coaxe, nor an in pieces of crap. There are good posts up, but by the way, speaking of Kuwait, I just mentioned in passing a while, our soldiers were over there fighting and some dying in the first Gulf War. The Kuwaiti hotchats, the princes and the other ragheads were on the French Riviera, a storting coke and partying until 4 o'clock in the morning and getting laid and having one gay old time. The face is Neil Roger. The face is 516, 815. Oh, a 30-day questcast. Well, I ran in Lincoln. The answer, granted, I drove up in the hill. You want me to show us.

Okay, we're perfect. I check I was thinking of sending this week in the other episode on a pony make it real slow. The story I was trying to find and this is not one they had to subscribe. It's right on the front page on their website. It taxed in Iraq, this is just in. Kill 16 more including five teachers slain at a school. I mean and we sing anything about this in me. No, we saw your president bumbling and fumbling there with his latest announcement about his high level discussions with the energy leaders and his good Saudi friends and about they want to expand the or the whatever. Right, they want to expand their profits and they do want to help a job and they're raping the public, they're raping the world. The old I.L. Like I told in the first place, oh I.L. And M.O. Any why even Tommy James and the Shawn Dells and Money money. They know what it's all about. I bet you Josh knows Tommy James and the Shawn Dells. Not. Yeah, I listen all the time. Do you know who they are? No. Maybe if I heard a song like I said, don't subscribe. A group of armed men, there you go. Money money, baby, that's what makes the world go around. Like I said, and that will be like so much network. Well, the Lord is a business Mr. Beal and he's right.

It's business and control. It's M.O. any why in C.O. and T.R.O. L.E. control. Can I read this story or not? I don't know how your Tommy James and the stick in Shawn Dells. If I never heard them again, and I don't know where they were. They were all right for about five minutes. A group of armed men burst into a crimson and clover my ass. A group of armed men burst into a primary school and town south of Baghdad rounded up five teachers, marched into an empty classroom and executed them a police official said, all those killed were Shiites. Ah, Shiite. It was close to the end of the school day about one paim in the town of Musaia 38 miles south of Baghdad when 10 gunmen dressed as police officers ended up building in South of teachers today. Man also shot and killed the teachers driver who was waiting outside and taken home for the day the official said the attack is especially cool as it took place while children were still at school. How do you like the little H.N.A.N. that rhymes? It rhymes at times. Was the worst in a string of attacks across the market that let the 16 people did including three American soldiers when who were killed in the road vehicles at Rochide it's just violence and bloodshed and we've got all those you know we got to settle like trucks over there we could be televising live anytime we wanted any craft that's going on because it's our puppet regime that's over

See, this is what kills me about these so-called news people. Anyway, don't start with that hockey step again, although the Panthers October 5, 13, and it's held season any first at all. What I just say, what was I saying before I got interrupted by that? The, the important of the story I heard is, intelligent design trial, against the impensalvania. And what I was saying is about the news meeting about they put all this garbage on there, and all the bad stuff that's going on and erect a bloodshed and the murder and the violence and the grotesque crap. It's like, maybe if you watched a crawl on the bottom, maybe you'll see something about that. But probably not. Might be. Yeah, it's just pathetic. And also this, this is a very, very huge story, even more important than those losers. By the way, did you check that thing out? Did you look at it? No, I didn't. Go to the Herald Web site. Go to mymeherald.com. For, let me do it right now. One moment please. Because when I guess that'll be on tomorrow, Josh, that's story about the dragon I sent that to you there, I guess. Yeah, yeah, it'll be on tomorrow. And when people are, we're, click the link so you can see the original story on the Herald. We, are you on a page, George? I'm on the main Herald page. Leithel, I, Lizard and Vade's Florida. There it is. Okay. Okay. I've got that. And look at a picture. Look how big that thing is. I've seen people smaller than that. Oh, yeah. Man, he, Bell. Well, I've seen them in nature shows. They're, they're quite, I've never seen like that. They can climb trees. They can leap. Maybe that's what's in my roof. Probably.

Or one of these giant monitor lizards could be that. Look at that thing. Well, maybe you can bring it as a pet. Especially for the hungry daughter. I'm not a company. Giant lizard as a pet before. Me too. Huh. Intelligence design, trial begins in Pennsylvania. They, a court case brought by parents in Pennsylvania could have a profound impact on America's debate over religion and rule in public life. Enough of it already. Okay. There are too many serious problems going on now. You're destroying the damn planet with your stinking global warming and all your evil emissions. Cut the crap already. All this hoax, pocus, all this nonsense, all the garbage. It's the fear of the unknown like that, a Michael Morthing and also when it's, uh, thing you were talking about, powerlighters, power nightmares. Keep everybody scared. Keep them in the state of frenzied and then you can do whatever you want. Yeah. Take away all their freedom. Break them for gas. And from safety. Safety. Safety. Anyway, get back to this. Dover Pennsylvania. I was going to say I wonder if dover downs is no, but it's in Dover Delaware. As you probably know, they got slothed there by the way. They were a gigantic person. In the beginning, members of the Dover area school district board rang over what should be required in their high school biology curriculum. Somewhere adamant that science teacher should stick with a lively taught theory of evolution and random solution. Others said that teaching of intelligent design should also be required. Arguing that certain elements of life like self structure are best explained by an intelligent cause. But cockroaches, somebody really intelligent invented them. They got that hard shell even in your step on them. If it's step on them, if it's step on them like three, four, a whole bunch of time. That's turned man. They took their feet. The debate had strong religious overtone. Nearly 2,000 years ago. Someone died on a cross for us at board member William Buckingham. I bet you jacked on those of Buckinghams. Kind of a drag. Don't you remember that song by the Buckinghams kind of a drag kind of a... Huh? Oh. I don't remember that. Don't remember that. You're all comfortable. They've been all the hit. Said board member William Buckingham who urged his colleague Susan. There it is. Susan, I think you're losing. And now you're getting ready for a bruise in anyway. Nearly 2,000 years ago somebody died on a cross for us. What do we dig a list concept? Said board member William Buckingham who urged his colleagues to include and tell you to design a ninth grade science classes. Shouldn't we have the courage to step up for him? And it's got him with a small agent this which surprises me. Although this one's smoking champion of those heavens. Yeah, they probably decabitalized it. Today a trial begins over the... Don't make a capital case out of a way. Today a trial begins over the board's decision last year ordering that students be taught about intelligence and design and the flaws in Charles Darwin's theories. Several parents fearing the intrusion of religion and the public schooling filed the lawsuit to block the policy backed by the ACU attorneys. Activists on both side believe the stakes are high in the case, which is divided into small, rural town about 100 miles west of Filta Alphia. They proceedings in a Harrisburg and by the way Rodney Harrison gets into the state and the paper is still when how do you like that? He's one of our main men. You do know that touch. He wasn't the only one. And they got a whole bunch. Yeah. And he still kicked this. The proceedings in a Harrisburg federal court will be the first legal town to the mandatory teaching of the design which is championed by a growing number of crazy, mani, a Christian fundamentalist to come up a bunch of dangerous people. A bunch of lunatics, a bunch of far-bison, as the Chinese column. The verdict to be rendered by the West history judge John E. Jones, the third, can have a profound impact on America's cultural wars over religion and its role in public life. Witnesses are expected to bait whether the intended design, contingent, is scientifically valid, or a Trojan horse designed to subvert Darwin's theories. We're fighting for the first amendment to separation of church and state the integrity of schools at Filta Alphia Attorney Eric Rothschild, who is sending up with a battery of Pennsylvania ACU lawyers to argue the case. This trial should decide whether the school board can impose its religious views on other students. The statement on its own into design to prove that over school board was ready to land for its science students in January, and will be ready to get this year and part it reads in part. Because Darwin's theory is a theory, it continues to be tested as new evidence is discovered. The theory is not a fact. Gaps in theory exists for which there is no evidence and tells in design as next Sunday's the origin of life that differs from Darwin. We respect any theory students have occurred to keep an open mind. Not, don't believe these lunatics, these religionists, these the God squad, they're crazy and they make up a much of a lonely so they can get your mind and grab your money and brainwash your ass and the rest of you two someday. Just take a look at all those people doubting and all those Muslim kids that are those damn democracies and they're rocking back and forth or anything. Then they get down in their hands and these and stick their nose and the guys ass and further down those magic carpets. What kind of mania is that what lunacy? Not to mention of course those Orthodox Jews that throw them bricks at those women at the wailing wall. Well, I guess those bricks are good for something, right? There you go. Remember that somebody else you sent after these bricks are made for even? Yes. Several days after the board six days we've order proving the intelligent design where as a lunatic three to sending members reside in protest, in November to oppose these slaves will vile for seven open seats on the board. One backing the teaching of intelligent design the other strongly opposed. Board members in their allies also believe that freedom's arts state, they've blasted the ACLU for seeking a gag order on what teachers can say they're gagging on it. The issue is bubbling out of the surface all over the country but the dober board had to their convictions said Richard Thompson, she counseled for the Michigan based Thomas Moore Law Center a bunch of far-visin. Go ahead. The Center promotes indefensive religious freedoms of Christians. He sent this hand-in case pro bono, pro sunny bono. If all this sounds early reminiscent of another case on evolution that is 80 years ago, 80 years ago are we making some progress or why? No, it leaps. 80 years ago the scopes trial and date and tendency with those trained monkeys. Tested the legality of a state law banning the teaching of evolution that case which inspired the young people to be in her at the wind featured an epic courtroom confrontation between attorney George Dero who was played by was the Charles Lawton who played parents to Dero. I forget. I look at it. Was it Paul Munie? Who was it? Scott Munie? Between attorney, attorney, attorney, attorney, attorney, attorney, attorney against the law and former Democratic presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryant, no relation to an eater who defended the statute. You know he lost three times. I think he's the only one ever. Ran three times in law three times. What do you think Jennings need to Brian? Although teacher John Scopes was convicted of violating the law, he states a cream court leader overturned the verdict suspended a sentence. Suspended a sentence. As in date and over policies have been roiled. The pages of very newspaper has been filled with letters pro and con and the national media have increasingly focused on the case. But there's a notable voice missing from the free. The discovery incident influential Seattle based organization that backs the intelligence designer argument is not supporting the law for board. We oppose any effort to require the teaching of a talented design. Said John G West, senior fellow at the Institute. This is a side show where politics in the front of hijack. And mandated he added saying that the Institute was also appalled that the ACLU is attempted to block the teaching until the design with a gag order. Residents of Dover and Paris sharply divided as the school board. The only thing they seem to agree is on the growing media coverage is becoming really terrorists. It's getting ponderous. So who do you want to know who played in the movie and heard the wind? Who played the Ernst D'Rale? All spurtacer. That's your phrase. That's right. He's a hundred. Yeah. He didn't take Ernst D'Rale. Who's in that movie though? Right. Well, who played Ernst D'Rale? Yeah. I don't even see him on here. How could that be? What do you mean by that? Can we have they didn't use the real names? Right. Frederick Marks, King Kelly. Right. Dick York. King Kelly. No, he dancing in that one or not. A whole couple minutes till noon is five. Six, he's having a few at him. This is Mark. Morgan is the 12-to-one hour on Q8. Um. Real American A-holes. Real American A-holes. He salute you. Mr. Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Mr. Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. If we've learned one thing in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, it's not the count on FEMA Director Michael Brown. What can President for you now? Our parents leave nothing. And that's what's left of the Gulf Coast. Nothing. Master Better God Call. Stifty two billion dollars has been allocated by the US government. But you've created so much red tape. The victims won't receive it till money, bro. So Michael Brown, you're the winner.

Three hundred a child, girl. So we salute you. Mr. Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. You'll clipboard your stupid Navy blue FEMA shirt and your comon shirt.

Friends Canadians for Gloria Steph on 3 and journey. So far it's got the big, oh wait till a big journey. Fan club finds out. And they'll go zoom into the top. I'm sure. I'm positive. Now I just got through mentioning before about the media and their work coverage. And here we are again. Here's Cameron Percelusian on CNN and they're Hawking and Hawking and Hawking again. And I'm in granted. It's a few manga stories. What's MSNBC? Oh, they got the guy standing there in New Orleans. Ron Blom. And we got water up to his duplicate. And there's Ron Reagan Jr. The Banner. Hey, Ronnie. You're fair. They have a ballet dancer. But for example, this weekend, you might not know that there were hundreds of thousands of protesting against the war in Iraq. I saw like two seconds of it on the news. I didn't see any seconds. I didn't see first seconds or thirds about this story. Nothing. And of course, any time people are protesting to the highlighted day feature it on the American media. Of course not. Because it's not good for the establishment. Talk of a pervinist. More than 100,000 protesters, but it watched in Saturday. The United States dual demonstrations against the West Side War in Iraq and economic globalization before coming together to demand that President Bush brings the troops home. Now, look at that. There's a line missing from this story. I'd like that Cindy Shea, an anti war protestor. Some was killed in fighting in Iraq. Was there camping out in Crawford, Texas. Very much of August while Bush was vacationing there. Her rallies drew crowds. It's sometimes never in the hundreds. As she demanded meeting with Bush. Will be the checks and balances on this out of control criminal government. She and said, was becoming anti wars best known face. She told the crowd gathered at the ellipse of Park We High to White House. In LA, about 15,000 people protested peacefully while thousands of marches in San Francisco and in London urging an end of military action nearly 30 months. But third man after an invasion lasted the Saddam Hussein. The crowds in March and 12 throughout the day. And by late afternoon, organizers of demonstrations said 300,000 people are assembled. We're seeking the anticipated 100,000. Meanwhile, the counter demonstration, boy, today draw some people or what? You know how many? About 400. Support for U.S. troops fighting your broad mix with anger toward anti-war demonstrators at home as hundreds of people far fewer than organized and expected rallied Sunday on the national mall just tens of days after hundreds of thousand protests against the war on Saturday. No matter what your ideals are, our sons and daughters are fighting for our freedom, said Maryland fats, who drove from New York Jersey to attend the rally. We're making a mockery out of this all-way and we need to stand united but we're not. That's right. Just goose step in line sweetheart. That's what eight all said. Hey eight all. You're fair. About 400 people. What a protest. What a you can get that many in a phone booth. I know quarter there. Right by Chuck Siv Center. Right on the entire place. There's more than. They were in for their drugs. About 400. That's another Chuck's that's right up to street a little bit by the barbershop. About 400 people get the nearest stage on the eastern segment of the mall. A large patchwork American flag serving as a bank drop in mid-banners and signs proclaiming support for the U.S. troops. Several speakers held the effort to bring democracy to Iraq and Afghanistan. They did not those who protested many demonstrators focused their iris in the Xi'an because she's evil. She's an evil to run all out of their stuff because she tells them what they don't want to do. The truth. Your kids are dying for nothing. They want to say those things because it's bad for business and bad for world prices too. Thank you again Mr. President for these bargain basement or prices and for padding the mark on its collective heads and what a nice dress you made before when he went but it would be. But it would be. But it would be. But it would be. But it would be. It would be. And we'd just build up the market. Let's take a look! It's going to be tight and it looks wonderful. Kick Kick Kick demain! That's one of a great polished climbers it is. I thought you were my buddy, my pal, my little, you know, pocket socket, rocket. I said, he's a kind of like small amount. If he gets to come in your pocket, like many bell, you know? Turns out to be a real mean spirited, bald-headed geek. WDQ, I am, hello. Neil, are you doing pretty good, sir? Spirey Port from the march on Saturday. I was up there this weekend. Yeah. And they were there for 300,000 people there. It was jam packed. I was a little bit more than happy to send George or you guys some photos that I took if you want to check it out. Yeah. We believe you. It was great to have speakers, you know, the march. There was a rally right before the march on the ellipse. And just there were so many people that was still in down. If anybody knows, do you see down past the monument, you know, along where a long constitution has been, you know, then the march took place, and I mean, the streets were jam packed. And that's because, like, great power there. Really well organized. And you're right. The news even in DC, I mean, I'm the hurricanes we knew, you know, it was going to overshadow it, but just there was absolutely no coverage of it. But it was happening and I'll send George to the QAM site, some pictures of you. Okay, great. Thanks a lot, Paul. All right, you're excited. You're excited. Whatever it is, you know what it is. You know where to go. Okay, what's this thing you're sending me now? Brian and Pompano B. So you should glory our step-on votes being included with the Cubans on your phone. No, she's a separate category all into herself. He's evil on and see here we go again with a mobile machine for adding individuals motion, I say no on Mo. You leave him off of this one. No, no, no, no, not today until we find out where he is, then we'll open an ass. Here's a facts that says from Eric, if the schools have to teach an alternative theory of evolution, line not also teach self-centered theory of history that says the Holocaust never existed. The Nazis supporting intelligence, a Zion should really go for that, since it was just those sinning Jews rounded up and executed, and the Lord's going to slaughter them anyway during the rupture and magnitude. That's a good point. That was the Jews and the Fags and the Gypsies and all these other undergarbles. You know Hitler was then plund-haired blue-eyed race. I saw him will be, I did I mention the son of Aaron Nye. I don't know. I told you about it. Yeah, I said, oh you made it. What's it? Or gay? Freakly gay. Not that, you know, anybody ought to be proud of that. But that seems to go with the territory with him and that Aba Brown was a real bull-dye. She was just a beard. She was to Hitler with Angelina Jolie or who's the other one? A Margo Kitter. For all the other ones at Tom Cruise and Supposedly of Mary. Oh, Mimi Rogers. And Mimi, oh Mimi, screaming Mimi with a huge giant... She wasn't the only screamer in that family. Not whatever. It's all just a bunch of bull crap. And of course, Katie Sherlock Holmes. And speaking of the anti-Cindy Sheen movement man, I'm telling you, they're really pro-airack war people are really coming through. And extraordinary appeal to Americans from the Bush administration for money to help pay for the reconstruction of Iraq. And so much has raised eight bucks. Six hundred dollars. Woo! This is an article in the UK Observer. Yet since the appeal was launched earlier this month, the nations and rebuild new Orleans have attracted hundreds of millions of dollars. I think it's almost 900 million out from the Red Cross. So it's over billion if you put all your money. And by the way, the Red Cross, we got a skating article about them. I put on the website. And correctly so. And you're probably saying, well, how can you put this thing up on you at the banner at? Well, we got to do something, you know? That's the best I can do. But I'm still very leary at the Red Cross, especially after 9-11. And especially when we're about to bureaucratic waste. And especially when we go about the goal they had to say, well, we saved the couple of million off on the side so we can use that for fighting the war on terrorism. What those are Red Cross got to do with the war on terrorism in politics? He might have an eye. Anyway, the public's reluctance to contribute much more than the cost of two iPods to the tent to offer citizens a further stake in building a free and prosperous Iraq has been seized on by critics as evidence of a growing ambivalence over Iraq. This coincides with the concern over the increasing cost of the war more than 30 billion. Not 30 million. Has been appropriated for the reconstruction initially, Mark has oversees a agency, USAID, expected to cost taxpayers more than no more than 1.7 billion. But now it's asking the public if they want to contribute even more money. No thanks. I gave it to the office. By the way, John, should you get that thing? I got it. No, okay. Is it working? I don't know. Let me try. It's understood to be the first time that the US government's made the appeal to taxpayers for 4.8 money. Contributors have no way of knowing who received their donations even where they may go. After official said details are had to be kept secret for security reasons. USAID's head or layman did not know it was disappointed with a meager somewhere as an after a fortnight. Every little help she says. In the past 12 months of American while we know about that. $600 for the most short-sharing time. Wow. Plus rebuild a rack. Don't you want to help rebuild a rack? No. You're doing it every time you go to the agasties. Actually what you're helping is help the Saudi princess get more cocaine. More that white powder. It is just absolutely unacceptable what's going on. And the media says back by the meat. But it will put about and we see all these guys waiting up to their armpitch and water and standing out there in the boiling and raining and on a big deal. We're unimpressed. We're non-plused. We're disgusted. This just fed up. The media is pathetic. Every one of you in a media and I know like I said all the networks have Miami bureaus and CNN with your damn Miami bureau. Except for our friend, I want to name everybody else at CNN should die. I wicked death and also a jack-haffery. We like him. The Kennedy. Except for those two. The rest of the misfested. That Mrs. Lindbaugh. That turned code bitch. And those bubble heads they have on at scumiles of Brian. And that's so late dad. Oh god. And what is this now? It is Bush look. They got the CNN cap's on. They got the hair back in a ponytail or a bun. What is that? That's the action news look. All I see. It sends me to action. It sends me right to my button. I want to see where it caused me. I want to see her drown in the Orleans. I paid big money to see that. If I made wooden sticker in a bathtub with plain clothes. Maybe they didn't have a good time in there. You never know. 1213 at 5.60WQA. And what was the other movie in the bathtub? All it was in the... The... The Jack Nicholson movie. Which word? Where the old of the broad comes out of the bathtub. What did they want that was so complicated? The shining. And that's what he means to like an 800-year-old shoe.

In fact, there used to be a big sign on our front door as nagging is BS. It's not only about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. It's not about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. It's about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. It's about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. It's about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. It's about the fact that we're not going to be able to do that. Republicans who joined the friends, he'd were poor record amounts of aid for victims of hurricane Katrina, now realize they give Bush a blank check without any notion of how intense to pay the bill. It would be nice if he'd released give us some idea of how intense to finance Gulf Coast rebuilding, said Republican Senator Conrad burns of Montana. Vizin is lacking, said GOP Senator Ralph Voynevich of Ohio, were floundering, were floundering over here, even flippers embarrassed. How's Luke help him do it? Oh, he's fun. Republican strategists complain that GOP dissense fashion with Bush is reaching epidemic proportion. Senior Republicans have been probably the expected season GOP candidates. This doesn't themselves from Bush. There are so many Bush naysayers because of Iraq. There's a piling on, effect going on, complaints are Republican consultant. Chris DePino of New Haven Connecticut. The what? The Pino? The Pino? Bush's troubles, of course, lead Democrats, clearly hoping to gain seats in Congress during the midterm elections and possibly take the White House back in 2008. Wouldn't that be great? Oh, at least it'd be an improvement. I don't think we'd be great for anything else. Anything but Bush? No more ban and b. Maybe no more Bush. Bush's troubles, of course, lead Democrats, clearly hoping to gain seats in Congress during the midterm elections and just after re-netzons, just as representative Rom and annual chairman of the House Democratic campaign committee. I think there's a lot of anger. We're gaining because of that. We could blow it. They can gain ground. They've lost, but there's a big shift going on. And I think if you take that one letter out there, it's the same. You know, terrible. You can smell it. It's in the water and everywhere. What's where you shift? Well, anger over the Iraq War contributed to the growing decision. The Bush was a Katrina Full Bar that pushed most over the edge. The breaking of the Bush spell opens the way for leaders of both parties to declare their independence and shaping more perpid national agenda, where it's columnist E.J.D. on the Washington Post. It's good we've played Siffle to suit today. Probably pissed E on off. The federal budget already must be for Katrina's now a laughable document. Finding a way forward in and out of Iraq will require creativity from those not implicated new administrations of mistakes. And if ever the phrase reinventing government had relevant, it is now that we've observed the performance of a government that allows political hacks to push aside the professionals, such as FEMA. Oh my God. People's lives, life and death hanging in a bounce and they got brownie hound on there. I mean, absolutely. And it really, it really, it horse ass is what he was. And it really, it horses ass. And of course, there are a lot of those, especially these Saudi-Rabin horses asses. Concludes the on. The Bush era is over. The sooner politicians in both parties realize that the better for them and the country. Recent months have brought home to them. And they've been admittedly growing majority of Americans that President Bush's government doesn't work. His policies are failing. His efforts to leadership is detached in self-indulgent. His way of politics is provided for a reduced aid if I had an angry and dysfunctional public square. We do not go on like this. It seems everyone knows that George W. Bush's did meet. Everyone, of course, except George W. Bush, are real pain in the push. 26 passed new and only that five feet people found dead in an apartment in Beaumont, Texas.

Tomorrow will be my last day of getting awakened early in the morning by page after page of Incipant crap coming over my fax machine from Tom Taylor and inside radio. Hey, Tom. Let's go away. Okay. It's the only time in my life I've ever gotten like a service that I don't want anymore. Well, no, it's the same thing with a paper like you said. I don't want it no more. Well, too bad. Here it is again. I don't want it. Too bad. You got it. And all that. Crad there's nothing. I the only reason I subscribed in case anybody missed it was it last week or the week before. And we got those rumors from the beast about Greg Reed is leaving at the end of the year. And it turned out it was an inside radio. So I had to subscribe to get it. And that seems to be the thing about nowadays. Oh, you have to subscribe to read this. You have to pay to get it. What is that? Why? That's how they get you. What do you mean? What do you mean? That's how they get you. They have something you want. They have paid for it. Right. Z. Yeah. What I said when I hear that every morning, O.V. Tired of it. Nautious.

Just like the sun showing up in the sky once in a while. You think that payday would be automatic. Not a QAM, not with the beeslies. Oh, well, this one did this and this one left it sitting on the counter and this one has a finger up her nose or somewhere. WQAM. Hello. Free the call. Where's mom? WQAM. Hello. All this quiet. WQAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. Good afternoon, sir. I'd like to say the George did a great job and does a great job when you're welcome back. Kind of a little late for that. Yeah. A couple things. The Cindy Sheehan, you know, the when I first heard about her, what she had brought up was were there under, you know, bad intelligence and we should just walk away and then all the things changed to he's a liar, which then doesn't work. And shut her up. I mean, it's like, you know, my wife's a bitch. I don't call her. What do you mean there's a work that 300,000 people protesting in the York and thousands all over the world and doesn't wait me doesn't work. But all the conservatives are saying, all the arguments against she and her is the fact that she's calling him a liar. You know, something, but it was John Kerry who, you know, no matter who it is that criticizes all the whistleblowers, she's near and Schmier that that's what's going to happen to you. If you all the scientists, all the other people that have taken issue with the positions of this bunch of Nazis, they're going to Schmier and Schmier anyway doesn't make any difference. But she's got the big pair. She's got a lot of people out of bandwagon. No, I think it's great. But he's got a week in a liar and he has to be called liar. And you're wrong about the conservatives because all the pools are showing that even in the article, I just read by Doug Thompson. They're jumping off man like he's got to play. That's great. Yeah, and I heard that article. They're running away as fast as they came man and God bless America. Or what do you used to be American? Remember America? I remember it. Yeah. What do you hear? The biggest topic, I'm not going to read the pool. The thing with the Cubans. They're obsessed with Cubans. The Cubans in the anglo's in the shards. He's in this one and that one. Everybody hit and that's the correct answer. Too much hate. It's right on the Cubans ass. 182 Cubans, 190 nine, too much hate, 180 two. And that's because you people all hate each other. And that's the truth. Yeah, I'd like to just have to play that everybody hates somebody. That's the theme song for South Florida. That's the theme song for South Florida. That's all that. How negative can we be? How much hate they call me negative? I'm Mr. Euphoria compared to you folks. Negative, hostile, and hateful. And just like somebody was saying before, I was a member of the resource, I said it or during the cross or with Hank. About last week, Hank said it about Ronnie Brown. And last week he was the biggest bomb in a bad draft pick and you know what they know all the stuff he used our hero. He used the best. Now, Phony is an 86 and a half dollar bill. Okay, that's not Florida, man. Phony, baloney. Ever had some, baloney, moroni, filary, where did he win? Was that short fat, Danny? Who did baloney, moroni? I'll look it up. Now look it up. Oh. This is bad news. I had bad news boys and girls in my billboard top 40 book is a phone apart. Because it weighs so much every time you pick it up, you know, has a tendency to like a phone apart in chunks. Do you remember? Right. I don't know how that. You know what I mean? You got one over the voting moroni? No. You don't have water. That's all. Yeah. Larry Williams, like I said, it got to be number 14 in 1957, Boni Moroni. Oh, that was cool. Also, I'd sure if I'd fan me. There's one music before 1960. Oh, well. At least reporting about you. He might as mine says for old you, Fags on it is what my book says on the cover. True. Fab. For 41. Ha ha ha ha. There he goes with another one of them Cuban things. All course early out of Rosanna Dan and I because the Kurdist He was the big gay right supported to. She's for gay marriage. She's for everything. Yeah. Who are you? Can honey you phony? How do you like your buddy, a raffy now sweetheart? And Jose can suck. How do you like all your boys? You bitch. You idiotic lunatic. You maniac. Iliana my. I still say let's put her in a box and bring guilty around her back. Right? All right. Let's make a deal. Let's put her in a box number three. Any box. But then again, it's your crowd man. Oh, no. She's wonderful. Right. She's offered a guarantee and she's got some head turn. Just like in a whole quick they stopped talking about John Roberts. He did proble no work for that. He writes thing. All of a sudden we didn't hear about that normal. Prop 42 at 5.60 WCOMB. It's shot. What like presents? Braille. Oh, Mara Kim. Hero. You man. You hero. Today we salute you. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. It's a filthy job. And no one wants to do it with except you. And you're not afraid to get your hands dirty. You. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. Drive up big brown truck. Put your nut to liberate anything. You're taking it away. Because when the seppic system starts to back up. It won't go down. You. Back up your truck. You whip out that big old hose. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. And suck, suck, suck. That mallota is crazy. But you're not done yet. It's time to grab that long handled shovelsquaker thingy. And make sure nothing gets low at the highest. Thank you. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. Put changing that giant 1200 gallon diaper. That's very six inches below the lawn in the backyard. You're too crappy job. So, track a cold, but life and pinch it else. To Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. Oh, real, American hero. Mr. Seppic tank sucker out of it. And he's a flush. St. Paul is Missouri. But he sure has a fancy cube. 891 votes on a pool. How's that? Nice. Oh, I'm impressed. Whatever. US force to import bullets from Israel is troops used 250,000 bullets for every rebel killed. That's a good aim. Yeah. Let's do that 250,000 times. US forces have fired so many bullets in a wrecking Afghanistan estimated quarter of a million for every insurgent kill that American ammunition makers can't keep up with the man as a result. The US is having to import supplies from Israel. Oh, I like that. What's that? They deal with bullets over Israel anyway, huh? They're much of gun nuts. That's right. The kill knows the right hits. A government report says the US forces are now using 1.8 billion rounds as small arms ammunition a year. 1.8 billion. The total is more than doubled in five years. Largely as a result of the war's nap Afghanistan and Iraq as well as changes in military doctrine. John Pike rhymes with bike. Directed to the Washington military research group global security.org said that based on the GAO's figures, US forces have extended around 6 billion bullets between 2,000 and 2,000 and 2,000. How many evil doors have we sent to their maker using bullets rather than bombs? He said, I don't know. If they don't do body counts, how can I? But using these figures have worked out in around 300,000 bullets for insurgent. Let's round that down to quarter of a million so that we're underestimating. 300,000 for insurgent. Well, man, even Santino never got that many on the causeway. We're all going to work on a virgin 900. You think we can make 1100 today? If we really put on a big push, start a grite. Huh? 905. What was that? And journey still's got to be way too late. Turnivote started pouring in, man. They're going to come in big bunches, just like hemorrhids. Count down the kickoff with QM79 to collect tonight at the press room at 1233 Lincoln Road in South Beach. Stop by for prices, great specials in March, Monday night football. Kansas City will decimate Denver. You take it to the bank. That's 79 of the press room in South Beach with 560 QAM. Your old use station. Man. Chris says, thanks to the recommendation of the film, the hospital was great. Right on Chris, man, it's outstanding. George C. Scott, one of his best performances. And another one of Patty Chasties, great Saturday. You see that trash? No. Now, after your take on network, I'm a little bit reluctant to give you another Patty Chasties look, but I'm a little reluctant to watch. You know, sometimes people blurt things out. I was just in the verge of saying, I might go out to the micro-lapse of the story today and the dietary and the scent of the email. I mean, email. I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't, I won't. That's the email. Huh? Don't waste your time. No? No. Why do you say that? What is it about? Like, what do we got here? About a hospital. It's about a hospital where, again, when you head of its time, about all these and raw medications and all just the crap that's going on there, how corrupt and incompetent. But it's just, I guess, not your thing, huh? I don't know. I've never seen it. It's, well, that's the idea. Well, I'll think about it. I'll think about it if I take Chasties up to the end of the time. I was thinking they like putting together a package. Maybe I'll go up there and buy that movie and FedEx, it's you. And George, I'll send them my best wishes. Maybe I'll even get you north by Northwest. I'm in such a good mood. Ooh. How's that? All right. Cause Amazon.com, right? You know, I'm not going to say it. They're all right. At least, at least when you order from them, you get this stuff. It's just that, uh, and sometimes they're delivery. And this, this story really cracks me up. WXDJ in Morning Show, co-host, and Ricky Santos has co-hosted Joe Ferrero. Those are those real two hot, uh, DJs in the morning. I actually did some posamy. Okay. Yeah. You're not listening them religiously in the morning. Hoop. And Ricky Santos confirms to radio and records that he's temper, left his gig at SBS's tropical L.S. and the school to run for mayor of Miami. Or at the L.S. old guys, the ones that brought me by that humongous picture of what's his name? Yes. What is his name? At Ricky. No, it's not in Ricky. It's that, uh, I don't even know what his name is anymore. It's a huge gigantic picture. Some, uh, fashion-up and Cuban singer. He was, uh, what's his name? Yeah. What is his name? Spico Rico. The Spico Rico. That's the guy. I left it and I see, here's what, this is what bothers me about these stories. I left the show while the elections are going on. Make sure we're within the guidelines dictated by the FCC Santos. See, that part is correct. The response from the community has been massive and I didn't want to people accuse me of getting that supporter winning because of the show. I want to do this the right way and that's why I decided to leave the show during this period of time. Well, that's the only way. You can't be on the air and run for office as how we'd stern found out when he was going to run for governor or mayor of New York. I think it was governor. Remember that? Few years ago. Yeah. What did you say? But you can't be on the air because if you are, then every minute you run the air, you have to equal time to your opponents and say, uh, I don't think so. Santos also said that whether he wins or loses or return to the WXDJ morning show, he is holding a press conference September the 30th. Thoughts turned him in at 1 30 in a BM at 600 South North, H3, my mean, talk about his campaign and Ricky Santos, he wants to be mayor of Miami. That'd be only an improvement, I think. When you? Oh, yeah, anything will help. Gotta be a major improvement. El Solman, now they're okay. Who is that guy in the picture? Jerry Rivera. That's right. Wow. You don't know Jerry Rivera from Haraldor River. Didn't know him then and I don't know him then. Yeah. He was okay. He couldn't see his letter of paper. He looked all right. And a picture, I mean, takes up a little bit of like a whole room practice, really. My house people, well, I'm coming. Got that at a wall because I can because somebody gave it to me. 916 votes. They're coming in and bunches and journey finally got one. Oh, here comes the journey man. The journey crowd when they hop on here. They're going to bust a bank. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you doing? How are you? Who's just talking about that ratio of a quarter million votes to one? Right. I wonder how many of the rebels are using every time they shoot an American because every time they shoot an American. Exactly. Every time they shoot down a helicopter they shoot whatever soldiers they say they got a lucky shot. Yeah. Maybe they got better. Remember maybe Alas on their side. Could be. Yeah. All right. Thanks.

Thank you very much. OK, pal. Nothing could be finer than to be in Carolina. That's right. The mission is out to Montclan. If he's listening, I love you, man. I'll see you soon. OK.

I guess it depends on the meaning of the word heck There are a lot of brownies as time magazine puts in its latest issue Bush has been further than most prisoners to put political stalwarts in some of the most important government jobs you ever heard of Time offers a couple of fresh examples such as the former editor of a Wall Street medical industry newsletter who now holds a crucial position at the FDA A tipster irrs me to look for brownies among regional administrators for the general services administration which oversees federal property and leases There are several potential ways a position at GSA could be a view For example an official macular particular businessman and inside track and the purchase of government property that charged against David Safavian was recently arrested or here a particular land or an inside track and many space to federal agencies Some of the regional administrators at GSA are long-time professionals but the regional administrator for the northeast and Caribbean region which includes in the New York has no obvious qualifications other than being the daughter of the chairman of the conservative party of New York state The regional administrator for the south west appointed in 2002 after failed bid for its father's Congressional seat is Scott Amy the army the son of dick army former house majority leader You get the idea go ahead and see what a rather who you can come up with jack Abraham office Alabi's to pay the huge it was paid huge sums by clients such as casino owning Indian tribes and sweatshop operators on side pan Two degrees of jack Abraham office inspired by their markable centrality of Mr. Abraham off who was in that last month On charges of fraud and Washington power structure the rule isn't defined important political players who were tending with Mr. Abraham Offets too easy and said you have to find people linked by employment one degree of jack Abraham off is someone who actually worked for the lobby Two degrees is a powerful Washington figure hired someone who formerly worked for Mr. Abraham Abraham off or who had one of his own form and plays but a work form Grover norquist the powerful anti-tax lobbyist is a one degree man Mr. Norquist was Mr. Abraham off's campaign manager When he ran for chairman of the college Republican National Committee then became his executive director and don't this Miss this is kids stuff as Franklin forest lines in the new Republic the college Republican organization pays serious salaries has been a stepping stone for legs of Lee at water and Carl Roe Mr. Roe by the way is a two degree man. He hired Susan Rauston Mr. Abraham Moss first assistant as his own personal assistant for those unfamiliar with what that means Ms. Rauston became Mr. Roe's gatekeeper the first new determine who got to see the great man Tom Belay the House Majority Leader is also a two degree man Tony Rudy who worked for Mr. Delay and several capacities left the work for Mr. Abraham off Finally, so nobody should be considered a two degree man on a kind of the recently arrested Mr. Safavian who worked for both Abraham off and orquist Then went into the GSA and under the White House Office of Management and budget or he oversaw for human policy But I'm not sure who gets credit for hiring Mr. Safavian. Okay enough joking to put in my games Which actually are we search programs for enterprise and journalists is that all the scandals now surfacing are linked Something rotten and the state of the West government and the lesson of hurricane Katrina is that a culture of chronism and corruption can have lethal consequences How did this a bunch of people see people dies people and how we got agitated?

I'm all for this hand drivers, and I can do a magic, because I know my hand driver here has been whining and moaning about the price of gas. In fact, it were rumors here last Friday, they had a crunch on all gas stations for a couple hours, because the rumor mail started that it was going to be like two bucks a liter, which is eight bucks a gallon! Yeah, and so people were in panic buying, they were tapping off the tanks because they were, they were all rumors on the streets that it was going to be eight bucks a course, they're not that's me true! But nevertheless, it's over four bucks here! Yeah, the cab drivers are really taking it up the old back door nose! Broward County cab drivers went on strike this morning to protest increased to Span's fees from the county's largest cab company at a time of record gas prices. A crowd reportedly numbering in the hundreds, pick a the Broward County Government Center in Fort Larddale, the Spanches were calling for extra cabs to service the airport, which depends on yellow cab for most of its taxis. Last week, we've grabbed with the man of yellow cab dropped recent increases into Span's fees, which the drivers plan were designed to take advantage of recent fair increases in the market. The county and the county, and the company, say, for rising gas prices. How do you like taxes? It's kind of sticking to those four cabbies. That's one job I would never want to have! No way! And of course, there were a lot of those drivers that I would never want to be in their cab to, and I've been in many! Oh boy! I could tell you stories here I told you about the one I was falling asleep that night, coming back from woodbine, and I've had many others!

If you ever eat into Swiss shallot, I'm not used to go there all the time! I have ever had the pleasure! And I don't know why, because to me, it seems like strictly for Goiam! David Lindorf and Counter Punch ran out of the eye! They take few of our calls here between now and two. I just don't have time, so I apologize they had a time! And maybe you even believe me! I don't think so, but, you know, did they believe me? No! David Lindorf and Counter Punch says they face oil prices, don't they? And of course the answer is... Absolutely! And thanks again Mr. President! He says there's so much propaganda, faith-based economic theorizing, and civil ignorance and I have tasted around the question of so engasilean and oil prices in this country! For a haven't said, of course there's collusion, an awfulistic behavior in price-picking in the oil industry! It's the way this particular industry operates! Start with OPEC, the F-Gang of Produce is largely in the throttle major oil companies, which sets production quotas for the most of the major oil producing nations. Then move to the large companies, they used to be 7, now there are far fewer mega companies, thanks to mergers like Exxon, Mobile and BPMico. Even when they were 7, those companies aren't really functioning as an independent competitive enterprises, and it's only gotten worth with increasing concentration. Because we find a raise offshore drilling platforms and pipelines are gigantic multi-billion-dollar capital projects, a typical refinery can cost upwards of $5 billion to build, most are joint projects involving several companies, rather as least the use of them. Such as the situation, all those elements of a business which are normally closely held trade secrets, important to maintaining competitive advantage, inventories, coup reserves, pricing, production rates, relative mix of heating, or low and high octane gas, etc. are common knowledge. It's not like a typical business, say automobiles or TV sets, or companies keep those kinds of number of secret, or if they collude, have to do it by meeting in secret and agreeing on higher prices. The executive said the oil industry never have to get together, whether they're over a game of golf or in a back office. They know all about each other's core operations, without ever talking. Collusion, not competition is a way of life in this industry. There's simply no way he is a competitive model, where we're explaining what happened to gas prices after the Katrina storm hit in New Orleans, at best 10% of production we shut down according to reports. That's 10% of one quarter of US demand, a tiny amount. Even if it were 10% of total demand because if we just import capability at the Louisiana port, we're talking about 10% while gas prices rose 25% to 35% even more in some areas. Not often mentioned in the same articles on this phenomenon, was the fact that the world price of oil actually fell by almost 10% over the same time period. When the world oil prices rise, as I notice, some sure most readers also noticed that the price of the pump is up the next day, sometimes the same day that the report comes out. Yet oil from places like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait takes months to go from the well-head to retail gas stations in the US. Even oil from head out to oil takes weeks to become gas to the station in the US. What other product do you know of where the retail price jumps towards immediately when the price of raw materials that goes into it goes up? This bread go up into store the day that wheat prices can't come up on a Chicago murk. This candy go up into store when the price of sugar rises on the comics. Of course not. Just gasoline home heating oil. So if more expensive crude oil doesn't actually physically get to the pump for months and the price of the pump goes up immediately who's pocketing that money in the meantime. Hint is not your local gas station owner. Just check out the stock prices of the oil companies. You know how to correct the answer. In a competitive model, the time Milton Friedman likes to sell a great company like Sonoco and Exxon would keep their retail prices as low as possible until cost-force and to raise prices. Something that simply doesn't happen. Indeed, it's a one-way argument. When the poor barrel, I'm sorry, indeed it's a one-way arrangement. When the poor barrel price of crude oil, the price of the pump hangs on at its high level. Sometimes for weeks, but if crude goes up, so does the pump price. Consumers can't shop for bargains because all gas stations behave the same way. For the most part, though, it's not the stations that are doing this and it's not the only way to be able to do this. Many of them are not even independent businesses that are owned by the major companies, but the oil companies themselves are doing it. The money that results from this elusive and optimistic behavior, in other words, is accruing to the oil companies and their stockholders. The beauty of this arrangement, from the oil industry's perspective, is that nobody can be fined or jailed for it under US anti-trust laws, not illegal to have elusive results. The government would have to prove elusive intent, and as long as the oil executive don't actually sit in a remote teleconference, and especially can aspire to collude on raising prices or cutting production, that simply cannot be done. If Congress and the White House were serious about combating price rig, important native production slowdowns and artificial skiersities, they'd be changing the anti-first law so that the objective existence of anti-competitive pricing and production loan will be illegal, not just deliberate conspiring to face prices. A simple step would be just to make all the competitive information regarding production and pricing of oil and oil products all the way from the wellhead to the pump public. After oil, as the oil companies all know everything about each other's internal pricing and production, there is no justification for keeping that information from the public. Instead, we have exactly the opposite situation, of course, secret meetings via oil industry subsidized by as present and executives of the oil industry where we'll close if the decisions were made. Oil and energy are too crucial to the economy and people's daily lives to allow them to remain the private domain of all company executives and the oilman, Bush and Shane, the name too, who run this blood and oil administration. But in South Florida, we do love the oily bird. This is the meal Rogers. This is 516A. I'm so happy. It's like nothing you've seen before. Excuse me, a steam father. What is it my child?

He could play a mighty right behind the Tommy Brady, not too close right behind. The red cross money paid rights Richard Walden and the LA times. And again, I'll say like I did to begin the show. We got the ban around there for the American Red Cross on our website to try to get people to donate. And that's fine. I did it a little bit reluctantly, but I know what else to put on there. Did you? Did you? No. But I already did express many, many times. My content for what they did after 9.11. In the fact that I'm real nervous about a lot of these organizations that have all this bureaucracy and waste lot of your money anyway. Richard Walden writes with Hurricane Rita now making news. It's time for Americans to take a more disciplined look at their tremendous generosity. As of last week, the American Red Cross reported and erased 826 million bucks in private funds for hurricane Katrina victims. The critical of philanthropy has the total figure more than 1.2 billion for all relief groups reporting. So the red cross received about 70% of all giving. This percentage was no doubt bloated by FEMA. It's mystifying released to the media of the names of 19 faith-based charities. Plus the red cross, remains a side in three lesson on groups to wish the public should donate. Rather than a much wider group of established relief agencies. This skewed giving to red cross would be justified if the organization had to pay the cost of the 300,000 people of the sheltered. But FEMA and the affected states are reimbursing the red cross under pre-existing contracts for emergency shelter other disaster services. The existence of these contracts is no secret to anyone but the American public. The red cross carefully says it functions only by the grace of the American people, but people includes government, national, and local, but would come to a spectrum of major disasters as they red cross media blitz. The national red cross reports it's been $100 million last year on fundraising alone, and it's hard to escape the organization's warning of armor getting if you don't call them the credit card number, or send a check or donate blood which it resails to the tune of more than 1.5 billion dollars annually, part of its $3 billion in income. In some account of 40, we've had the spectacle of drive-by drop-offs of bags of money in public places such as the Rose Bowl, massively promoted by local media, Hollywood studios and stars in corporate America compete to make huge donations. The red cross brand is platinum. It's fundraising vastly outruns its programs because it has very little or nothing to rescue survivors, provide direct medical care or rebuild houses. After 911 the red cross collected more than a billion dollars a record in philanthropic fundraising after disaster, but the red cross could do a little more than trace-missing people, help a handful of people in shelters, and provide food to firefighters, police, permits, and evacuation crews during that catastrophe. When New York Attorney General Elliott Spitzer asked for documentation of the red cross's response was that it is federally chartered and not answerable to state government regulators. The clamor rose however when the media began dissecting red cross activities in the line 11 aftermath, this resulted in the resignation of the organization's president and chief executive, Dr. Bertadine Healy, and the appointment of Senator Extended and George Mitchell of Maine to oversee its 911 fund and help clean up its image. Funds were then pushed out the door including millions to New York Limot drivers who said they lost income after 911. In Wobbscale Resin, Sir Lorman Hatton to help pay their utility bills. The organization also ran in trouble after the 89 San Francisco Bay Area earthquake when it was revealed that it planned to spend only a fraction of the millions of dollars that had collected the area damaged by the earthquake. When the Bay Area is mayors found, up the insisted that these funds be spent on housing, homeless shelters and health clinics, the red cross had to weigh for one time only its longstanding policy against funding non-red cross groups. Spare changed and there would be a lot of it this time, stays in a red cross national disaster account. This allows it to spend funds donated for one purpose on another one. The red cross expressed to raise more than $2 billion before hurricane Katrina related giving subsides. If it takes care of 300,000 people that $7,000 per victim, I doubt each victim under red cross care will see more than a donut, and interview with a social worker when a short term voucher for a cheap motel, but a few miscellaneous items such as clothing and cooking pots thrown in. The red cross is 3 million unpaid volunteers, 156,000 of whom said it says our deployed hurricane Katrina are sold of the earth Americans. But asking more all the faculty collected money will go and how much red cross is building FEMA in the affected states is a legitimate question even if posed by the person of a small relief agency. As hurricane redadisipated, let me answer my unpopular question like this, giving so high a percentage of all donations to money agency that defies itself only as a first responder and not a re-builder is not the wisest choice. Americans ought to give a much larger share their generous charity to community foundations, grassroots non-profit groups based in the affected communities, and large number of international brand name relief agencies with decades of expertise in rebuilding communities after disasters. And then it says Richard Walden's president and CEO of Operation USA, a 26 year old international disaster relief agency, based in LA. Anybody ever heard that? Operation USA? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. That's all the red cross would like more your money and they can do it with it and have a good time with it. Maybe somebody would get a donut and maybe a purple star to jelly bean with flavor dotter. Maybe a crispy cream. Well, you don't. You don't know something we don't hear anything about them anymore. Okay. Who was off the road? And it wasn't just a low carb thing. There's a low crossing as all over that's did me. But it's just a, it's just ran its course when people began saying something after eating too many of them. I'm dying on the hand. How many people have seen that? Okay. We got to load on our moes more in the building. Can somebody, uh, and we spied him. Have we seen him do you smell him? Is he there? I don't know New York is yet to fan. I'll find out there in the break. Does anybody care? This is Neil Rogers. This is 5. 16. Oh, go, go, go, go. This is WQAM where they very build them all and they don't come any better than Todd Keller. Oh, we're moving on. We're going up to the gas and so on. Oh, there's more right for us to go. We're moving on. We're going up to the gas and so on. And they're making no really any inside. So I go through the station. I got to ride me a day. Things like a lot of dead presidents are just a few little but that's okay. Take a look at that day. And then boys dance to eat. And then girls go and they think they can't fall asleep. We're moving on. We're going up to the gas and so on. And then boys think they can't fall asleep. We're moving on. We're going up to the gas and so on. We're going up to the gas and so on. We're going up to the gas and so on. Thanks again. I'll start the last day for the carbon based gas prices. You and your schmuck ahead. The Saudi buddies man. You and all your pizons. Partners in crime. Don't forget Bush and Ben Laden. Okay. Who's with the B is an bastard Spastard ghost. Like I said, we don't want to do that. Don't set the bar too high, man. Don't set it too high. If it was 87 in the whole, I was just the random homesture. He is live in this studio. In the studio. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. And then we got the 9 dollars for that Marlin game, that's a good big tune in audience and a tremendous crowd at the stadium. They're jumping off of that bad wagon man. Fasten you and say a B bag. The most in that's in 10 to play the Marlins talk about any any camp on show. That's our kind of pristine line of today. The biggest problem with South Florida is the Cubans to 146. Too much hate to own nine. You see the cross over there. You see the connection? We hate the Cubans, but there's too much hate. Right. The driver's 120, he humidity 114, the politicians. Let's see, you didn't put those other ones on there, did you? Roger. Josh, which one? Too many redness and too many Bible thumbers. Who? Let's get those on there. Now, please just in the nicotine man, the driver of the 120, heat humidity 114, the politicians 26 New Yorkers 88, hurricanes in tornado 75, too many old-fart 67. That should have had a lot more. Too many nasty, hateful, miserable, old yentres. Nothing gets paradise 36 say it's a food paradise 3.3% not too many. French good eighties 11, Gloria Steph on 10, journey headache and the new Roger show, Solomon P.C.s. We only had six. So that should make this feel a little hot. Only six people are hate us like you're poison. Well, like I said, I'm thinking seven. Bye bye bye.
