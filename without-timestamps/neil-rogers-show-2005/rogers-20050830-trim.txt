Yeah, I'm doing great. Ninety high rise is going up in Las Vegas. Yeah, in the next three years, Bobby Dan. Who's going to live in all hurricanes in Vegas and they'd be going down? Yeah. Well, I don't know what terrible, yeah, you've been to New Orleans and to the... Well, until a two imagine that team, or that team, that's city. See, there you go with that sportsman. Yeah, right. You got to get the program. Can you imagine being there for your out-of-the-out power? Yeah, but this is really a horrible thing. Yeah, it sure is better than then us though. Yeah. That's what I was thinking when you guys had the effort to, from between, to better than than me. Well, you mean you guys. You guys? Not me. You weren't there either. No. Well, we're smart. We stand a lot out of there. Just one more good reason to stay as far away from here as possible. We're going to get like the ass-in of it tomorrow night and then Wednesday, some little bit of rain. Not a lot, not much. We had to be giving it to you. But the forecasters down there, all you people ought to be in jail, okay? You're so full of crap. I can't believe it, because I'm on your last Thursday, and I'm reading the advisories, and then I'm getting led down to Garden Path by what they're saying on CNN and the local channels and everybody else. And they're full of crap. You know, why can't they just say we don't know? Yeah, we don't know. If you go anywhere from like zero to the keys and everybody, you know, do whatever you have to do. But when you're dealing with a hurricane, and of course the politicians are like the boys who cried wolf because they've all in the past. They've screamed in a Howard and tried to whip her up. What happened to her friends? So many times for nothing when it was obvious to storm was already, you know, past day and broward that they have no credibility. Nobody pays any attention to them. Nobody got covered their pants down. The craziest people in television are those hurricane reporters. Yeah, those guys are nuts. Not to mention anybody specific, but nevertheless, I know one who wasn't there to cover it. You're fair, but nevertheless. I'm talking about the guys on a weather channel and what's that kind of thing? How about all these guys? The same thing this weekend. In fact, one of the local channels here this morning, they were showing a, like, a a compendium of clips of all these different weather jerks getting blown away in the storm. Exactly. I saw the same thing. They were just wondering, that way. Tell me of break. What the hell is that stupid? Instead of having them inside and dry, what it's like giving them tells you report. They're like, oh, I'm hanging on for deer like that. Yeah, it's just, it's a story becomes about them. No, of course. It's just stupid. Yeah. Stupid news for stupid people. That's why it's America. I've always had my list of racetracks, which I'm sure you forgot about. I did not. Ninja? No. How many of you got it? Well, not as many as you. How many of you got it? I have one and neither one of us have been to. Yeah. Yes. Leslie Vicer, who listens to you. Really? Yes. And what are you listening? Leslie called me after our conversation about that and she said, I've got a track that you and one of you have been to that I've been to. Yeah. And she gave the redoso down. Oh, I've been there. Yeah. Is that quarter horses? Yeah. If you got two bucks, that's what you get back quarter. But anyway, she mentioned the track that I don't think you've been to either. I know I haven't been. Yeah. A vanjoin downs. I've heard of it. Did Andy Anna? No. Well, we're easy. No, close. But. Oh, is it still there? Yeah. That's a good question. Oh, and speaking of that, you know, I've seen my friends at Componope Park. They only, um, kissing those in Beloxy. Wow. And they said that a lot of the kissing those had water all the way up to the second floor. So you can imagine what a mess that is. Yeah. I don't know. Those are boats. I don't know. But no, no. In Beloxy? Yes. No, they're not. Yeah. I haven't been there. But I, uh, I asked something about it. I think they're kissing those there. Yeah. I saw one. And it's a riverboat that just has to a hotel just like they have in, uh, Well, I'll be damned. Well, they can just like, look at that. I have to see. But apparently, uh, I'm just going to tell me how they tracks around your list or you just, uh, avoiding me to say, can't, this counts Europe, right? Anywhere I've been to about 1834. Yeah. I knew you were going to be me. I heard you, the day, uh, the, the last Thursday two weeks three weeks ago. You want my list real quick? 34. Do we have time? Yeah. You know, me motor mouth. I can spit them out real fast. But would vine? It's, uh, garden city and St. Cancephens go along with their garden state news using or along with their 40. The city, uh, the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of the city of was there a second tracking and boss inside in affected terms of the o him so then there's a clue this is one class up based on pshefer Bisco then So they had addressing itself uh... looking in the campbody leading their restaurant yeah cooperated that was they continue torob all day upon our good nick of that then brought them for engineers by the way, got into yesterday. He couldn't win a fixed race lately. What's the story within? One mistakes on Sunday. Well, that's the first race he's won in weeks. He had a horrible meat. He had eight wins for the meat out there. Yeah. Got into it in the first race yesterday and taken off his mountain. I don't know what happened. I gave out a nice $25 horse on the show from there. Didn't call me and tell me about it. Oh, yeah, to do was turn on a television. There I was. From where? From Del Mar. From Del Mar. The first of it class. That's in New York, San Diego, right? It's in San Diego. Yes. Well, there you go. Never been here. That's a beautiful place. Well, I have to get out there. Yep. You would like that place. Hmm. And the more I like wood bind. Well, wood bind is, I don't know. I've been a wood bind. I had the breeders cup there. It's pretty nice to go. It's all right. So I'll tell you the place that I was at. When you got to take it, I'll tell you the place I was at. It's my business in this orange. Oh, you know something? No, I haven't been arlington. I'll take it back. Have not been there. It is. It is great. And you know what I'm talking about the new orange. Yeah. I'm sure you were to the old one too. I was. Well, that counts for two. It's two different tracks. But the new orange and people go out there. I mean, they get young people there. They do a lot of stuff to promote. They just have this problem in Chicago with tracks burning down. Washington Park was the old harness track in an ethno. Well, there were a lot of stories about how the orange didn't happen to burn down. Right. Well, Chicago is interesting. A lot of guys with their nose out of joint there. That's what San June, Connacet. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you guys know. How to jump when you find out that JFK was sleeping with his ex girlfriend. But there's something to be said for that, I think. Yeah. When the boys are running the city, it runs properly. That is true. I like that. And that's what K. Edgar Hoover said too. He liked going to track after the oral when he used to fix the races. Chicago was a great city. Did you ever read it? It is. Did you ever read about that about how when he used to go to the tracks? Yeah. Edgar Hoover. This is a true story that they would guarantee his bed. In other words, they would give him the horse. Ha. And they were fixing the race form. He didn't work out. Which you know anything can happen. I like that. He would get his money back. Yeah. Why can't we get to be like that? No, it was when I go into the woods. I like that. If you have a machine we'll lose for me. And if it doesn't pay out. And when I leave every day. So here you go, Mr. Rogers. Here's a check for three grand or two grand for one. Yeah, but Neil, another one in the gambling. Who cares? I'll take it. It's got like working at QAM. That's a gamble every time. Yes. So 34 to 18. I got you a beat. Well, that's good. I'm proud of myself. Very good. I was a harnessed track, though, right? Yeah, that's what I was saying. Yeah. Northfield. Well, you've been. I think the Northfield, I think the story was incredible. Yep. Talk about a deep generous. That's what everyone hopes of. There you guys was on a bus with him. Driving out to the game the next day and he said, that snowstorm was horrible last night. What'd you do? I said, I went to Northfield for the throtters. He said, you are. He said, I thought clear mojur was the sickest guy. I know, but you just beat him. I got a better one. No, I want to throw from Detroit with a couple of friends to Cleveland for a race. We got a tip from a jockey. This guy's a girlfriend was friends with a jockey at the R.C. We drove to Northfield Park in Cleveland to that on a horse called Mr. Z. He came in fifth. And if it jows a gack? Yeah. And also, jows a gacking. There's a gacky stop. At any rate, and we also drove to from one time from Detroit to Batavia. You know, where Batavia is in between Rochester and Buffalo. Yeah. To watch speedy Scott race at the feet of the dance. And he broke at the start at one to nine and finished last by 100 lines. I mean, you know, even the great horses have a misrap and the crowd was bullied. You drove from Detroit to the Batavia. That is correct. That's sick for a race. Well, they're he come trying to out do you on the degeneracy? Yeah, I got you beat. You just did. Yeah. And he broke at the start. That's awesome. Also one time drove from Detroit to Batavia to see Cardigan Bay with Stanley dancing. Driving, you're parked a whole mile and finished fourth. Good time, boy driven by Henri Fidion, one to race. Now, do you know how many years ago that it is? 32 years. And I still remember it's something wrong there. I keep saying my whole life, my brain is filled up with crap that I'm trying to keep it. Just get the program. You know how they do like a high calonic, you know, to kind of like flush out your ribs. Yeah. If they could do the same thing with your brain, then it'd be great. This is the best. Oh, God. You made my day. Okay. Welcome back, my lawyer. Is it the other way around? Well, I'm we're both back. Yeah. Today, this week we have a pristine schedule. And just remember, it's not important that we succeed, but that the other guys fail. And boy, did they do a good job at that in the trendy vanished off the face of the map? All the ink that those guys are getting over there. You can put all the funny, ballooning you won on the year. Dan, you'll have passed you. But the fact that it matters is you guys don't even show anymore. They're not even the top 25. Don't exist. Nothing hurts a bad product worse than a lot of good advertising. Is that what it is? That's what it is. Remember what it feels right. We remember Peel's beer. Yeah. That's what I'm saying. Nothing hurts a bad product more than good advertising. Was it a bad beer? They had a bad brew and they had Burton Harry Peel. And they never did. Bob and Ray, and they were great commercials, except for one thing. People brought up beer and they were spitting it out. Kind of like straws. And you tried to make it a straws? Yes. You used to the nickname for it was Tiger. I can't say the word Tiger P. Yeah. I got to be careful. I got to be careful. It's horrible. It'd be careful now. I'm being careful. I'm being careful. I'm being careful. I'm being careful. I'm being careful. I'm being careful. You have a nice day. It's time for me to go. Okay. See you. Time. Dear Jannings. What a life. Oh, I mean tremendous. So, cause for some of Georgia. Hello. Hi there. Hi. First of all, I want to thank you for channeling Mr. Jennings from Beyond the Grid Forest. Okay. Peter, how long things in hell? Well, it's hard. I never thought it was going to be anything but hard. So, I guess now you're really a smoker, huh? Oh, yeah. I think it goes with the territories, with the Targeta. Oh, California for Peter Jennings. Hello. Hey Peter. Do you know any bets or levity joke? No, man. If I did, I wouldn't say so. All the win-city cancels. Hello. Yeah. Peter, are the rumors true? Is hell really a couple degrees cooler than the center of a McDonald's apple pie? I think the answer is yes. But you've asked a question that a lot of people in the country are going to ask today. Some are said Kentucky for Peter Jennings. Hello. Hi, gentlemen. Hi, Mr. Jennings. Is there a link beyond music in hell? Yes. And it just happens. It goes on and on and on and on for hour and hour and hour after and. Oh, my. I think that would make my ears bleed. Oh, many do indeed. We're going to call. We have an in-left Downers Grove, Illinois. Hello. Mr. Jennings. What would you like for Christmas? Uh, Simon Hussein. Oh, so, so, thumbs on your wish list. Yes. As he's George Bush, George Bush is also Peter Jennings. Yeah. Thank you, as always. Thanks. That's really nice to see you. That is beautiful. You know it. Every now and then we at least expected something good. 10 past 10 at 5. 60 WQAM happy Tuesday. August 30th. I'm sorry to man. And if you don't have any power, you probably listen on a battery operator. You're not listening at all. Are you listening on somebody else's internet? Or what is this? Russian head cranky. I'm sorry about that. Again, I just can't believe how bad the so-called experts blew it last Thursday in Friday. There were clueless instead of like saying, and didn't I say, which I'm not saying that I know anything, but I said that this thing could go anywhere. You said that. I got something to that thing, but a Chad Stewart Clyde, whatever his name is on CNN about. Bokeh, I know he had the direct line. And it did take that northwestern jog just ever so momentarily. And so it looked like a dead point of my headbokeh. And then there were saying like couple hours later, well between four Laternil on Pompano Beach. Well, guess what? Didn't go anywhere near Pompano Beach. The eye went right over Georgia's house. I don't know about that, but what? I mean, I live in Pompano Beach. You live here on that's right. You keep, I've never seen a guy that keeps moving around so much. So they're like a hit out on you or something. What's the story? You know, Fred Diaz. Like box car. That's right. You do this like your predecessor. They're the one you sleep on the overpass. Yeah. Yeah. You just got like a permanent address to work this job. Jesus. Every time you turn around while moving this week, you're really moving around or what? At least is there only a year, buddy. Yeah. It's been a year among the move. You've been on this show for a year? I don't want to show over here. Yeah. Really? Yes, you did. Oh my god, time is just flying. In fact, time flying on this great summer schedule. That's where really he's got me. Just a gas. Do we still say, if you just holy cow, yeah, just fug it. Man, this schedule this week and next week and then it's just a little bit of a big day. I keep thinking about yourself five days a week. Oh, have to be smitten me man. You better do it on my legs. Wow. This whole, I mean, this is, this is fine. Let's just keep going this way. This is working out about a trend came out. We don't discuss trends anymore. Except the fact that we didn't do the two great and no Spig it in place in the trend in July. No, speaking of the way, say, who the ostations went through the roof. And that's because anybody just speaks English gets out of town in July. And the only people available to send them to die res are, you know, who the old Julio is who the listen to a radio man be. And the other, see, it's not important that we succeed, but that Wancy fails and they sure are doing a great job of that. Nice going boys. They fell off the, off the face of the earth, off the face of the globe. We're all in ink that they're getting man. I don't care when we do the break. We got no spots today anyway. So I'll just, I'll just, you get that piece of copy that I just, I'm glad to relax. Everything is under control man. Everything on this end is under the sun. He showed a word. Beautiful. Soft Florida consumer still recovering from the most recent way of gasoline pricing. Crisis could face even higher prices, perhaps as much as 30 cents. And gallon in the aftermath of Katrina, the storm shut down oil production in the Gulf of Wancy out there. They got conflicting reports on this, depending on who you listen to is. What excuses for to be how much damage was done. Tore through the heart of the West, or refining industry, closing plants that supply most of the gas these other fuels, using the try-counted area, datebrowden Palm Beach. Soft Florida, which gets about three quarters of its gas from the Gulf Reef. We should be seeing higher pump prices as soon as new deliveries of gas are arrived. So Jim Smith presently Florida Petroleum Marketing and Convenience store association, which has about 50 cents. In other words, thank you Mr. President for those low gas prices. And they're going to say, well, he had nothing to do with the hurricane. Well, guess what? Don't be too sure with that. A two words you need to keep in mind global warming. Oh, there you go again. Yeah, there I go again. Let's go to the right. Global freaking warming. Those three words. I can't believe I've been a more trackspot almost double when Hank's been to. Some are much bigger degenerate than he'll ever be. He's working on it though. 14 after 10 at 5, 60 WQM was your most people are ice-holes. So when you think of the back it's the brightest. Oh, yeah. That's it. It's the first time you get hit. You don't need to grab the spell if you can't wear it that. Oh, yeah. Hey, we're out. Hey, we're out. Hey, we're out. Those just grab the wind and get back down. He'd a lot of things to ball back down. That penalty to the shower that I would. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 10, 19 at 5, 60 WQM. Anyway, right before the storm hit, which was seven o'clock on Friday. On a visit for 30, 39. Seven o'clock on Thursday. We've heard the southeast Florida coast right there in Hollywood between Hollywood and like North Miami Beach, Helen Dale, they were saying. But anyway, there were still saying. And I remember reading the advise you were on the air. We're saying we can't agree one. And then Montreal's made it to where some of these so-called local experts, some of the weather theories, who were saying, oh, it might not even be a hurricane. It might just be going back to being a tropical storm or less than 75 miles an hour when it comes on. Sure. Well, guess what? Yes. You know, I realized that it's emphasized forecasting the weather. That's the understanding of the century. But I mean, it was so bad and so far off. And you'll notice that even, and they were also saying that when it was going to go out the ass and side of Florida on a west coast, and then it was going to go out of the Gulf and become a category two or three hurricane. Remember that? They become a category two or three hurricane? No. It became a category five hurricane. And then even those who was like approaching no leans at the very last minute there, it took that little jog to the east. Luckily for them, I mean, they got horrendous damage. You're just devastating catastrophic damage in the roof of the superdom. Just about got peeled right off and big chunks of it got ripped open. But can you imagine if that would like to continue where it was going? Wow. And so instead you get a block city and mobile all those places that got hammered. I said, okay. So we category one my ass and like I said, it's just, well, why, you know, they can't find a happy medium. They either over, they get it to everybody hysterical at the point of like jumping out of windows or it's like, Oh, well, this is going to be much to do about nothing. And but if they had me convinced that it was like a little overkill, you know, like, just a little bit of wind and whatever. And then it took that left turn very similar to Andrew and I respect. Right. Remember how we saw Andrew sitting right off there right east of the, the date brought with line kind of then on the last minute took that left turn and just smashed your homestead and color origin p-rion. So stay in the keys. Here's George's poll from yesterday. What's the worst thing about and we apologize by the way for all the off the year time, but then again, if you know, and they are what they are, you know, they suck. Just the way it is. I was getting reports that as of three o'clock Friday afternoon, which is a Thursday afternoon long before the thing. And and what else were they saying, eight o'clock till three in the morning, it was going to come on sure right right well guess why. Or didn't that. But by three and a half new people already were losing their power. Now how is that possible when there wasn't any storm yet? I mean, you know, there was some rain in some of the outer bands and the boys in the band, but other than that, then what's anything right right. So why was the power going out? I don't know. Yeah, but nevertheless, like I said, seven weeks from Shivou, you'll have it back on. I don't know where those FDNL announcements are that they're always putting on the year in situations like this where they say FDNL apologizes for the fact that you're sitting there in the dark. Oh, with your battery operated radio and, you know, you give me some kind of idea what's going to go on. No, I don't see that. Explain where it is. Yeah. What's the worst thing about living in Florida with Georgia at 912 votes, pretty good from a lot of dissatisfaction. By people and, you know what, I voted for the winning category, the people, two hundred and two, not even a contest. The people, all of them, a lot of them. The people, the governor, that's the fat ass governor to you, a hundred and seventy-one to jester. Little brother, the heat, 143. Now is that the basketball team or the weather? Take a choice. Or maybe it's the traffic, 116. By the way, Josh Curtis just moved again for the 18th time this month. I just, I can't keep track of that whole deal. Now you're moving because you're moving up in a world or you're moving, you know. I mean, I live, I actually live in the same complex. I just moved in with my brother. You moved in with your brother? Yeah. Well that's not good. I saw movie last night. The Morrison tapes. Yeah. I'm sure it's not like the Morrison. The Morrison murders was the name about two brothers and one of them killed the rest of the family. I just mentioned that. Not good, living with your brother. The storms 102, the mosquitoes 29, as your girlfriend also live in in there, as you got like a three way going. Yeah. No, he's smart. Now definitely not. Oh. The 2016 storms 102, the mosquitoes 29, as big as come quotes. The utility companies, you can mean like FPNL and the other ones could you 23. The schools 20. By the way, Clarence, you can take, you can take that electric socket and just plug it in right inside your Echo, idiot. You quiz like just get out of Georgia's face already and stop trying to play bushboss with George. It also, you only comes in when you're on giving you instructions. Well, don't throw that. And don't talk them. Screw you with Clarence. You idiot. You quizling. The schools 20, the restaurants five, well, we got a lot of good restaurants in South Florida. Now as many as we used to have, well, so many good ones and the stores one. What does that mean? The stories. Well, you know. What are the stories of late? No. Okay, well, there's only one vote. So there's your thing. Now, getting back to El Presidente, thanks for those low. Oh, look who they got on there. Now, speaking of hysteria. Have you got the water? Have the water continues to rise at the current rate of an inch every five minutes. We have been on emergency backup generator power since about. I'm a Tulane University host. Who will clock in the morning yesterday? I want to work with you again. At the current rate. Exactly. We will lose emergency backup generator power. At last. Oh, and there's Mrs. Alimba. You see, no matter where you're touring, you can't win. Yeah, we're just surrounded by vashes now. If you supposedly are liberal, but I guarantee you to rub off. It's a time magazine's got an article in the issue that comes out today. It's global warming, a fuel and Katrina. I'm not going to read it because it's kind of like wishy-washy and buttov-bubble, but maybe this, but. But it says warm ocean temperatures are a key ingredient for monster hurricanes, prompting some scientists to believe that global warming is exacerbating. Can we say that? No. Excessorating our strong troubles. One especially sobering study from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but what do they know? Find that hurricane wind speeds have increased about 50% in the past 50 years. And since warm oceans are such a critical ingredient in hurricane formation, anything that gets the water warming more could get the storms growing worse. Global warming in theory at least would be more than sufficient to do that. While the people in the world in the world may not seem to have the hurricane or the next one they do see could make even Katrina look mild by comparison. In other words, more likely maybe a tsunami, mommy. See that? Global warming just those two words. They were actually talking about that the other day. And I thought, she they're going to pull the plug on whatever channel I was. Although probably a Canadian channel because if it was in the US, they'd like, you'd see the word police coming in there. The truth police coming in the stormtroopers just dragged them out. Remember how they were like, dragon Howard B. A lot of the studio that time? Yeah. We can't let her simmer that. At least 55 day well, that's what it says in this story. Well that's in Mississippi. I think 64. But they, you know, it's going to be a lot more than that because they haven't been able to get in where these houses have collapsed and other buildings. It's going to be that that toll is going to be in the hundreds. Am I right? Yep. What do we have seven in South Florida? And let me say again, all you weather furries out there. You blew it big time. Man, you had you were just, you weren't even close as far as where the eye was coming on shore as far as how severe was going to be as how much the damage. And you're not even close. So why not just come on and say, we don't know, just go and get your apply wouldn't risk weed and the water and batteries and act crazy. Do whatever you need to do. But do something. And anyway, more than 55 people that are Mississippi, even with Katrina's swirling way to the north, two different levy breaches, New Orleans Senate, churning sea of water coursing through city streets. And just hear that woman was from Tulane Hospital. The hospitals in state open on generator power, but they may not be able to do that because the water is still rising in course New Orleans is already five feet under sea level to begin with before this. But so what can you say other than it's horrendous and grotesque and catastrophic, but better than us and that what we always say, that we feel don't feel bad, right? Right. We just not as bad as we do for a while. And of course, one more reason never to go there anyway. This is Neil Rogers. This is five, sixteen. That's a thud. That's a thud. Tonight I'm Brent Kamp. Don't miss a special guest appearance from Philadelphia Eagles by receiver Carol Owens. The motions are running high. That's the third and most good chance to have sold over begins. See if they need to tell me a set up. And I just tell them I'm a grown man. I told you the same. I told him he said, you don't have to tell me. I don't tell you. The ball through those to be able to be very old with the yard. And look at the possibility change. I had two. I was not going to say for you. Just wanted to have this conversation with me. He was a step forward. You're moving through the trauma that issues that you went through. That's a bunch of life. Very, very quick. You know, I'm not one of his keys. Pretty much the morning sunshine. He sets your wings and show your colors and patterns. So you will be known. This can't be bright. I just want to play football. That's Terlowins. Tonight on Brockkamp. Sagewalk will never be the same again. And then you get to everybody knows who reals for it. So how about those dolphins? I'm going to show you the little girl's team. We get Josh's Tampa Bay bucket ears. Exhibition game only points on. That's correct. Meaning was. Do you go to the game? No, I did not. We'll why not. I don't know what I was taking it's coming. How are those tickets coming? Where's Ray Perry with my dolphin tickets? Huh? I'll go talk to him in the evening. He said, you shouldn't you have had those by now already? I would have thought yes. And priest they have one more preceding game. Well, it doesn't that package include all of preseason games as well. Yeah, that's well. So what does the story? Ray Perry. Hi, you're quizzing. You're fair. That place is just coming on glue. I don't understand what that piece of copy. I want George. I want you to take a look at that thing. You just sent me that I just attempted to do a forruse. Yeah, I got it here. That could be the all-time worst piece of garbage. I mean, just the misspellings in the grammar and the periods where they don't fall long and the ones lacking where they do belong. And he just I apologize to our friends at Armstrong Toyota and Armstrong Ford of Homestead for a fact boy being such a lumics. Maybe his puppet was getting in the way of the word prices. There I don't know. But it's just it just kind of seems like the whole operation is coming undlude. But nevertheless, pay taxes are showing up. 218 votes on our poll today. What's the best movie of 2004 and 2005? Not a lot of good ones. I'll take it at. That's pretty obvious by your response so far. You're in height 9, 11, 54. That's my vote.

Hey, by the way, Troy, you're a good guy, but your sales efforts are really like the rest of the guy. Draw a week, really week. Well, he sure sucked in his way out of the this morning, didn't he when I bitched him out? Good. Stay away from us all these sales holes, okay? You're idiots. Except the new guy. What's the new guy's name? Jay and Billy. They seem to be like stool human. Since it is 3, 54 states 3. Broken flowers to the born supremacy, too. With Ms. Matt Dylan. Matt, David. You're fair, Matt. Matt Dylan, Matt Damon. Robots 1, chocolate factory 1, more of the world's 1. Oh, brother. Or the world's speaking of. You're fair. Nobody knows one constant gardener 1, Phantom of the Opera 1, the Punisher 1 day after tomorrow 1, I robot 1, and then no votes yet for this these that are under list. And I didn't just pick these out of their mirror. I picked them out of the lists of the top box office movies. Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Matt a Gasku team of heaven, stealth, unleashed. Look at me. Head on. My summer love. Downfall by Helsing. Collateral and Hellboy all have the big. So far. Right. That's what we got. Did I put Hellboy on there? Yeah. That's all there. No, it's on there. But I mean, maybe you added it. I don't know what was on the list. So there's a whole bunch of them I don't have any. I just noticed that we're like with all the hurricane stuff. Still going on with all these hundreds of thousands of people without power. We're like a command performance. You know what I mean? I'm sure you were aware of that. Yeah, we were commanded. Yeah. And of course, things are going so well on a rack. It's a good thing that the hurricane came along the like life all that stuff off the news off the headlines. Thousands of Sunni demonstrate is rallied in Sodom who's saying's hometown of the CREAS, that a to denounce their maximum constitution. But they have to negotiate as finished the new charter without the endorsement of the Sunni Arabs. Sunni leaders have urged their community to defeat the charter when the nationwide referendum on October 15. Saying it had been rammed through the drafting committee by dominant Shiite Arab and Kurdish alliance. The absence of Sunni endorsement after more than two months of intensive negotiations. Race fears of more violence and set the stage for a bitter political fight ahead of the referendum. A political battle threatened the sharpened communal divisions at a time when relations Among Shiites and these incurreds appeared to be worsening. Oh my God. And other words, everything's going great. Oh, we're fine. First great. Here's some good news for you before we have any calls. Is Sunni where we're going to get some to the addon. We'll see. Come see. Come say. And I'm saying if we get him fine, if not. What is that idiot? Chad Everett Myers else for our down below that 39 mile per hour number. That's where you go from a tropical depression to a tropical storm. And then you go at 74. That's when you get to a hurricane. So now we're down to a tropical depression. Great news. It's right. No, okay. Of course, a little bit too late for some poor bastards, but nevertheless, it's a depression. All right. It's a depression. How full of crap you people were including this guy and seeing it. And you know, seeing a needs to be taken off the air. They need to be off the air. Well, let's go to the next day. And now, well, let's go to the next day. And he's he's a teasing some horrific pictures that we have coming from the world in some horrific footage. He's a mad man. It's just like that air France plane at the person here a few weeks ago to same kind of crap. His stereo. That's how desperate they are on CNN. Don't watch it. Okay. Just to program it out of your account. I'm looking. I'm sorry. Watch your watch your name and I really caused me a bit some real good last. Talk about in common with a thin pasty voice in the the bizarre nose man. She was love. Oh, we're going to go. Are we going to go to Microsoft? Can he hear us? I mean, we're granted. You know, the hurricane and everybody's got technical problems and glitches. But I mean, she just heard true lack of professionalism and lack of any right being on the air. He has shown through the last couple of days. Readier and idiot man. You're a bubble head. But here's the good news. You can use the effort in class but only five times in England. That's great. Really? Yes. A secondary school is to allow Prince and pupils to swear at teachers as long as they don't do it. More than five times in a lesson running. Tell you of how many times the effort has been used will be kept on the board. If a class, if a class goes over to limit, they won't be spoken to. If they had less and other words, they're going to get like thank you. Something is what is. What is that? What they're calling us. There's teachers like Spank and the kids. Remember in Clockwork Orange? Oh, yeah. Is the astonishing policy which the school says will improve the behavior of pupils. That's behavior with an IOUR was condemned by the parents group and MPs yesterday. They warned it would backfire. Parents were advised to the plan which comes into effect when term starts next week. And letter from the Weaver's school and well-earned North and Ham. North, what is it? North Hamptons. What are those brits? What are the warpins of these? As long as we got the brits. Excuse me, this schmits. How long is a lesson? I don't know. As long as I take to finish the spanking. Back to home. Yes. You heard that? You're going to teach you a lesson. Back to home. And then keep banging away, banging away. Well, spanking away. Well, I see more. CubitQAAM? Hello? Yes sir. You have one for the poll, right? Yeah. Right, Charles! Yes we have. It was called Russell. It was a roll rate. Okay thank Valley. It was supposedly pretty good. I did like to reach Real. I saw most of it. It was all right. It was adequate. I did not have any, what's his name? Will Smith? No. Well, because he plays everything else. He has other black eye here. I thought maybe the heavy will smith building heard a real after they heard Jamie Foxx into the fine job. Oh, that's right. Jamie Foxx was very good. Then he went and asked her for that. He didn't dominate anyone. Yes, he didn't. He asked. Well, I'll be down. Twenty me four, eleven at five, sixty, nobody can't wait. Hopefully everybody is safe and sound of anything is okay. Our copy is horrendous and our sales department is just losing it entirely. I think you goes back to the top of the head of the fish again. Don't you? The head of the fish. The top of the line back there. There is something really stinkin' back there, man. And you know what they say? The fish stinks chop off the head. It is just unbelievable what's going on back there. Over there were down there next door. I go back there and just pee right on their desk if I were you. And during the next break, not even if it was on the side. Just go back there and give a little hose job right there under the desk. I mean, just incredible what's going on. I said, it's up this morning. Why do we even worry about ratings and trends and I knew this stuff. It's just like we're in perpetual, just kind of floating our way. Like it's a perpetual hurricane. We're always a floating our way through life. At any rate, the church keep coming in the clearing and that's all accounts. 19 before 11 is 5 and 16. But if you only got a pristine schedule today, by the way, the more mysterie. The more mysterie. The more I don't know. The more I don't know. Maydog is 4 or 6 30. You got your marlins on deck. The cardinals in town to play the marlins at 7 o'clock tonight at 7 o'clock is the game time. Anycalf to the ballgame. Big series man. What is this only? Oh, that's right. Did they win or lose last night? I didn't see. We took a beat in the last night. Again, after taking a pounding into Kagawa on Sunday. I thought they took a beaten from the high flying cardinals. Was a score. Six one. Ooh, they took a pounding in that's bad. If time's tough, I just pitch every day and get hit by a pitch every. What I tell you about that 95 year old Greg Maddox is he good or what? Pits the good game, but when Push came to shove man, he pushed it. This is their brother on special assignment for Shibi S. News. I saw how had they major announcement to make. I have decided to change my name from their brother to DRAT. I thought the entire dead brother name was getting in the way between me and my fans. I've also cut my hair to a point from the front and die the tip screen. So I might appeal to the young hipsters. I've also traded in my Lincoln town car and got myself a new whip with his slain. For call, my new ride is a Cadillac Escov. And I've picked my ride. I've got the spinning rim. I've got the dice hanging from the mirror. And of course, I've got a kick ass sound system where I can play or two-plot. Plus, I've got a plasma screen that I've actually showed how to kick it with my homies and play video games. I've redecorated my house or my crib. It's fat and when I say fat, it's spelled P8A2 with your slain or two hip. Happen it because DRAT is re-enettin' himself. I'm wearing my blame. And I'm comin' action. We're in baggy coos and faking holes. This ain't no hard of that girl. DRAT's on special assignment for CBS News. You go Dan, 1046 and 560 WDQM he already did? Yeah, he won't. He's a kick in the ancient styles, what I'm hearing. Papya Cannon writes a national emergency. Oh, and let me just tell you right now, the stories that are on our website today. We're gonna get to this other one here in a minute. I got a whole pile of stuff and I don't really care if anybody cares or not, right? Right. Good. Ed Naha. Well, he's the one that wrote this. Who is Ed Naha? Let me just, you know, because people like to know who the hell is Ed Naha? Maybe he knows John Levitt. Remember John, maybe he knows Ed Naha? Let's see. This is, say on here who the hell is? He's just a calmist. He wrote a column called cable news, Huxters and Harlowets, which fits in with Robin's and he's about all the propaganda that you get fit as news. That's on our website and of all the stories that are on here. Those are five of you who read the stories. That's the one you want to be reading if you don't only read one. That's, he's got his thumb right up. It's too long to read the whole thing. Papya Cannon writes a national emergency. He says on August 12th, you must go Governor Bill Richardson to clear the state of emergency due to a chaotic situation involving illegal alien smuggling and illegal drugship. It's on his southern border. Three days later Governor Janet and Apollo, Toronto followed suit and Arizona. I wonder if Janet's related the George de Pala, Toronto and Jonah Pala, Toronto, family and Anthony as well at Pala Park and Pocano Downs. Reason, the crisis on the border, the ally, ally and free immigration policy of George Bush and Bencetti, Fox, beloved of corporate America, has created a hell on our southern border. Those southwestern states are being indated by illegal aliens, trashing rants, killing cattle, committing crimes, eating up tax dollars, the traffic in our cutters and human beings from Mexico as a national scandal and a human rights disgrace. Florida's true of New Mexico and Arizona is true of our nation which is now home to an estimated 10 to 15 million aliens who broken our laws and broke into our country. It's a mark of the cowardice of our leaders that they're so terrified of being called bigots that they tolerate this criminality. The moral rot of political correctness runs deep today in both national parties. A president like Teddy Roosevelt would have led the army to the border years ago and if Fox didn't cooperate, T.R. would have gone on to Mexico City. Nor would I, who deported and legally deported all illegal aliens in 53, have stood still for this being done to the country he had defended in war. One of these Bush Republicans are afraid of. Dury looks from the health at the country club. The question of whether America is going to remain one nation or whether our southwest will wind up as a giant coast of O, separated by language and loyalty from the rest of America is on the table. Whereas Bush, all wrapped up in the issue of whether women in the jaffel have the same rights and divorce and custody cases as women in Nebraska. His legislative agenda for the fall includes a blanket and a steeper illegals so they can be exploited by businesses who want to hold wages down as they dump the social cost for their employees, health care, schools, courts, cops, prisons, under the taxpayers. Not only of Richardson and Apollo Fano awakened, they're on the front line, so too as Hillary Clinton, who's spoken out against illegal immigration with a fort-rightness that makes Bush sound like a talking hit for La Raza. La Raza. Why is there a public in Congress permitting this present to persist in the dereliction of the sworn duty? George Bush is the chief executive of the USA and is his duty to enforce the laws. I think a little swig of soda here would be in common. Those laws are clear. People are breaking out of be sent back yet more than 10 million of broken in with impunity. Another million attempt to break in every year. Half a million in succeed. Borders' security is homeland security. How then can the Department of Homeland Security say America's secure? Who can guarantee that of the untold millions of illegals here in the scores of thousands of order deported for crimes who have disappeared into our midst? That not as a terrorist waiting for orders to blow up a subway or a mall and massacre American citizens. Most of these illegals come to work to send money back to their families. They're not bad people, but because they're predominantly young and male, they accommodate this fortunate, share of violent crimes. Why should US citizens be assaulted, robbed, raped, and murdered, and have their children molested because the government won't enforce its own laws? Is this not an indictment of democracy itself? What dictatorial regime would put up with this? Not only this one. The Republican Party claims to be a conservative party, but what kind of conservative is it who the cut a few costs or make a few bucks will turn his family's home into an neighborhood of flop house? In a recent poll, 40% of Mexicans, 40 million people, said they would like to come to the US and 20% express their willingness to break in. Time to cut the battle about how NAFTA is going to solve the problem. This is a national emergency. Twice George Bush was taken off to preserve protect and defend the constitution of the US, article 4 section for the constitution reads, the US will guarantee to every state in this union a Republican form of government and shall protect each of them against invasion. While we are being invaded, the president of the US is not doing is doing the protect the states against that invasion, some courageous Republican to get the attention of this white house should drop in the hopper of bill of impeachment charging George W. Bush with a conscious refusal rep old his oath and defend the states of the union against invasion. It may be the only way left to get his attention before the border vanishes and our beloved country dissolves into Mexico, what's here called a polyglot boarding house for the world. Thank you, Pan and finally, I met you some money. How do you like that, huh? You go, Pan. Nice going, Pan. Excellent. Can we take a call or two here or what? Good. We get a whole bunch of movies on there. I really don't care because I don't think we got anybody listening anyway. I mean, they're all like being put in their lives back together, we're getting clean up all that trash and admests. Hoping at FP and L, might get off their ass for those poor bastards, all those families who are sitting up there and how many days do you have to wait three from Thursday to yesterday? So, to Friday, Saturday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday, Thursday almost four full days before George finally got his power back and luckily he had a generator and spilled gas over the inside of his car, his on mess. They go out to take it now to Armstrong, Florida, Armstrong, Toyota. Okay, I'm serious. Find out from Fat Boy, I can't get over that he sent it. It's just why am I surprised by anything it goes on this place, right? Why should it be? It is so sloppy, it is so, and I'm supposed to make magic from that. You give me a piece of turd like that and I'm supposed to make it into a goal, a goal leaf, you fat tub of garbage, you idiot, you quiz when you... You're fairing. Dominic, you weigh in, hello. 2 AM, call waiting line. Dominic, you weigh in, hello. Yes, sir. Hey, I have a weather-perry fire port. Yeah. This is the city of the city of New Orleans, was streaming their newscast on the internet. And I was watching it and who should come on to be interviewed, but Brian Andrews. Brian Andrews, that's what I say, Brian Norcross. I saw Brian Norcross on a couple of times in national TV doing his weather-free bit. No, he's in... Yeah. Yeah. He has been set by his Miami station, I guess, channel 4. Do you know where you're going? Brian Norcross, not Brian Andrews. No, no, no, no. He was in China, school. Yeah. He said he was from WFO, and he had been set to cover the New Orleans weather event. Yeah, that's... The people in Miami could see it for a fan. Yeah. I mean, come on. Ian, where that's talking about women. Okay. I thought there was going to be some punch line that I didn't even like hear the... There would be something new that... Here it is. Oh. How many QAN hello? I don't... Neil. Yes. Thank God, yeah. It's just like the Z-Long time listeners. First time calling. Yeah. I still love you. Yeah, nobody cares about that either. How you like that? That was good, huh? But we could have said, huh? But there's more. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, let's get a lot more like those two. Yeah, let's do it. Let's kick an ancient style, man. Pound 5, 60 on the Verizon and Singular Wireless Lans that I mentioned by the way that you're probably back sometime between now and next year of U.S. For those of you who are like wondering if your life is ever... But again, like Hank said, can you imagine maybe up to six weeks with no power in New Orleans, so in those other places? Wow. Oh, the flooding. Yeah. I think those people are all to just like... And when you say pack up their stuff, what stuff? I mean, I mean, maybe if they got into car and evacuated and got that out. A lot of people were, but obviously not all of them. But I'm not sure how much stuff could they take with them, right? A little bit. So you're going to be seeing a lot of people who's very sad. And you know how you see these homeless people with like, uh, they got like a trash bag. Yeah. And they're... No, no, seriously, their life is in a trash bag. It's kind of like when you work your QAM. WDQAM, hello. How's that far, hello? WDQAM, hello. Yes, sir. How are you today? Pretty good. Good. I just pulled up a spider guy about 10 minutes under the door. I'm going to go on a state road 7 and you know, we push bumper stickers on the bag in this car. Yeah. And I just had to say to, I just pulled up a timing. I was like, we do that. And I said, so I used to support Bush. Because he had a new support Bush. How could you support a guy who opens the borders? Who sends the kids to die for, you know, for money, for a caliber, and this and that. And you know, you know what? He's still doing a great job. Yeah. I'm like, yeah. Talk it about. I mean, this guy still thinks it's a thing to go in. You know, some people can book if you tell them that it's great. You tell them that they'll actually believe what they close the right and not see what's really happening around them. Yeah. There's the only people to blame for what's going on out of the American public man. 50% of the people in the country are so, so I think in stupid man. It's unburied. Oh, no. Yeah. I mean, they're not rates at all. I did one, the one, the woman there to counter a Cindy Sheehan. And she's hysterical. I support my president. I'm just carrying on like a maniac. I'm what are how much they're paying that bitch. But that was a city sheehan was reporting the president. Sheehan. I'm saying, remember the women that's doing the woman that's counter protesting is doing. Oh, yeah. I like that. Okay. Okay, pal. Get your ears fixed. And it's a 1057. How's that pull on the movies coming on? I thought it would be like a little diversion anyway from all the depressing stuff to movie thing movies always. Yeah. All the evidently, and it's not because these people don't go to our goal for today on the Apollo 300 votes by the way, we got 285. Why? Well, I listen, the way things are going right now. Best movie of 2004, 2005, Fahrenheit 9, 1176, that's our crowd, of course. You come a pink, olibule fags. They all suck 33. Didn't see any 24. I mean, what is that? That's embarrassing to me. Wedding crashes 21. The incredible 17 star wars three has got 16. Batman begins 13. He'll build volume 2, 11. Since 79, passive a Christ 9. Oh, Jesus, Spider-Man 29, Cinderella Man 8, Ray 7, 51 states 5, hitch 4, Troy's got 4, and a guarantee of screw-and-saw mall. Born supremacy 3, war the world's two broken flowers, two robots, one, chocolate factory, one, King of Kingdom of Heaven, one, nobody knows one, nobody knows the travel icing. Well, it's not really worthwhile. We know these others with the one. And we got 285. So our goal is like 286. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5168. This is the Neil Rogers Show. This is your grandma. Any questions? With a quick editorial, here's Pat Robertson. Hello, this is Reverend Pat Robertson. Many of you have been criticizing me because I called for the assassination of Venezuela and President Hugo Schadd. Now before you try casting the first stone, let me clarify my statement so you don't label me some religious salad. As decent God, fearing Christians, it's our job to cleanse the earth of all the evil dictators, even those who pose no imminent threat towards us. For if we do the rat thing by killing people we don't like, we'll be rewarded when Jesus comes down on a gold studded chariot giving out those boxes of raisinets to all the good girls and boys so they won't have to pay. Those over inflated concession prices. The next time they see some crappy rob Schneider flick which I don't even know if that piece of crap is that on DVD. If she's me, Pat, yes, start for yourself. Okey, don't be them. This is Pat Robertson and you have a great day. Was that Pat Robertson or Bob Sheefer? I heard him say Okey, don't be. Maybe we ought to send him to Lake Okey for nokey or whatever it is. Blots and the leafs out. Maybe God is cleansing the leafs out, if you think. Not bad. And the honest bush on there the other day was it yesterday or the day before. And I was on Sunday and he would not was this during a speech yesterday about how well all we're doing is praying for praying in our Americans, you're praying to God. Well, if you're praying to God so that so many people don't get killed during the hurricane, how come God let the hurricane happen in the first place and at least heavily populated areas you bose you any you fair you in the soul. It's always the same thing. That's pray to God. That's the American in the Silicon way, man. Also anyway, gold star for families for peace. Gold star families for peace. That's the name of the group. They've got a PSA they're running with not a PSA but a spot paid spot with Cindy Sheen. It was just down here before the 11 o'clock during our break. Didn't see it. It's great. And she looks right in the camera and they sure to close up and she's talking about he lied the bush lied and her son died for nothing. What's this noble cause and why not admit our mistake before it's too late and we kill any more soldiers and yadiani on any course. You know, go to fall on deaf ears. You people in the media and I know we have you know CNN's got a bureau in town and then it was have their local bureaus. You're at a disgrace each and every single one of you man. You have the power. You've got the ability but you're all in fact this article which I urge everybody to read. I said that before but you won't do it anyway. But at least I told you so. Cable news, hucksters and harlots by Ednaha. Ah ha. And I'm only going to read a part of it because it's like a long, real long but the nice thing to be said about cable news is just when you think you can't sink any lower it surprises you and goes substratta. To be range coverage of Cindy, she and police, Rimshah and I'm not just talking about thoughts is if that was actually a news channel regarding the train wreck formerly known as CNN when she and returned to Crawford last week, a legitimate news story and I stress the word news CNN somehow felt responsible to report this news story by also featuring a segment spotlighting folks who are pro bush. Thank god Martin Luther King juniors no longer run giving his pesky eye of a dream speech. CNN would probably offer equal airtime to the grand dragon the KKK for indefinitely. The blur between legitimate news and editorializing is now forever joined at the hip like an ester from the top-rounding movie freaks. It's truly jarring and equally disgusting but the fixes in no news is our news. Wouldn't it be great if these corporate media hucksters are fit to apply this tacked across the board? When bushutters in an entity like our strategy is straightforward as Iraqi stand up America's will stand down, you'd cut the blitzer or donner or fiction and a gift with an opposing view, well both clearly are present as talking out of his ass again. American reporters both in news printed on the airwaves have never been so corrupted. They suck at the teeth of the beltways if they were be afferend children need a curled mother's milk not to get news to spread out to us common folk but to further their careers in doorstepment spued propaganda as fact. As Dan Froemkin and aces online writer for the Matso Hotsawashman post reported last week, these guys will do anything to keep their jobs. About 50 members of the White House press corps accepted President Bush's invitation last night to come over to his house in Crawford. He'd his food drink his booze hang around to pull and smooth with him while promising up till anyone what he said afterward. Perfect. Reporter sworn the secret in order to touch the helm of our freckless leader. Touch the hem. I didn't know he wore dress. It's lovely. The associated press waiting with the jovial, the casual affair of five catfish, potato salad, coleslaw, homemade cheese and chocolate chip cookies, followed a tradition in which Bush and his wife Laura have the press covering his annual longest vacation up to their ranch in central Texas as sort of a thank you. Yes, thank you for bowing down to the anointed one. As Froemkin pointed out, one Bush touched particularly appreciated by the working media, invitations were sent out at the last minute. So only the reporters in photographer's already in the area could attend for having any big footing by the media leads in Washington or New York or on vacation themselves. So if you're covering she in have a brusky, cover and call rove, forget about it. Another ironic note in order to get to the big bash all the reporters had to drive the bashy and scamp on route to the Republican version of Valhalla. What's death when you can get a headpan from our perspiring president? Bush has good reason to sweat, Cindy she in space has enjoyed Bush's worst enemy. Why because it's real, she's not a politician, she's not a group, she's a mom. Because of that fact, the Republican smear machine, by extension, the slacker president's thrall, have been working overtime even going so far as to create a prefabricated grass movement by a Republican-oriented PR firm, dubbed, you don't speak for me Cindy. It's bus tour, professionally organized as opposed to she ends this scene to camp out a Crawford actually being backed by real people. As beginning pumped up by all the cable outlets, CNN, MSNBC, and of course FASC, which should have renamed Weasel about eight years ago, sorry real life Weasels. Even dubbed the effacing three poles in the past week, which came between 36 and 40% top clarity rating, with nearly 60% of our citizens we now opposed to the Iraqi quagmar, decided to get on the creative media train, attempting to blunt she and s-anthai warm mom's dead and is far from a counter mother, Bush supporter Tammy Pruehut, America lives in freedom because the families like the Pruehut, she smear last week, and produced in the Pruehut family on live TV. Okay, Pruehut has had five sons and a husband serving in Iraq, her husband is now home or sons of all alive. She's not exactly a grieving mom, which fits in with Bush cause never ending attempt to sanitize the war. Once more, when interviewed after Bush's blood deviation, Pruehut refused to slay and she, and just as she refuses to slay those military parents, who disagreed with her position. Bush's spokeswoman in training, Trent Duffy, has been sticking it to she and all week, even going so far to comment, the president can understand that people don't share his view that we must win the war on terror, and we can't retreat and cut and run from terrorists, but he just has a different view. This particularly offensive piece of Bush coast, smartman, is when, widely under-reported, but it's now official, if you don't support Bush's invasion, you want the terrorist of insurgents or whatever we're calling them to win, and this goes on and on with quotes from some rotesk, well, some all the stuff that's going on on TV. To make a long story short, it's very long. It's on our website, cable news, hucksters, and harlus. You're a disgrace. Absolutely disgrace. Hey, you know something, if the media did take a long time during Vietnam, but if the media would have reacted this way, it's still me fighting in Vietnam. Yeah. I'm telling you right now, they're a bit of a rollercochon, if you have the people with balls, 560, 560, pound, 560, and a Verizon and Siggit Arwalice lines. Come on, you QA, and hello. How in the hell did John Roberts lose that job? The Bob Schiefer. How did that happen? Because he had to be on the Supreme Court, man. For the next few weeks. For that. Anybody should know that, shouldn't he? That's right. Get with it. 560, pound, 560, and a Verizon and Siggit Arwalice lines. Come on, let's get these phones smoking, man. I came in here today, working over a hot microphone, looking out at that beautiful sunny sky. What's the temperature here right now? What is it there about 110? I got to clean up that mess. Another hurricane. 24, 75 degrees, a high of 12, about 77 today. I'll take it, you know. Maybe I'd be paradise, so we do have a lot of smelly foreigners here, but nevertheless. WDQA, and hello.

Well, thank God for her man. She's one of the few that have listened to me. We did that informational thing a week or two ago. There were a few. They don't listen to me no more. Maybe that's why Dan has seen any spots on the show. Maybe they know that the power of Neil is just gone. Yeah. Yeah. He had that tremendous power. I can, the only thing is ice cream. All there is looking for luck. See, wow. I just had receded quite a bit by the time I got there, according to some of the other. But there's sky miles of brand. He ought to drown. That's what God's punishment ought to be for me. We have a slip into that gigantic lake of water. They have on the road. They're just drowned. For his irresponsible so-called reporting on an air france thing. The person here three, four weeks ago, you're in this race. You're an idiot man. They ought to put you on an express shuttle. Okay, just blow it up on purpose with you. Solo. You idiot. You quiz on you. You're fairy. God. That's the me. I'll tell you the news media. Forget about Bush. Forget about all this other stuff.

A decorated warrior, a running from president, I guess a well-known draft dodgeer. And then they turned it around and they get down rather than candid CBS because it effected it the story that put on even though it was true, they couldn't substantiate it.

Did you felt it? I felt it too and spelt it. Wow. After only hours without power experts recommend you toss meats, seafood and dairy products, toss it. So we have a refrigerator often those in the freezer as well. After her pain can train the some stuff for it and it's been days without electricity like George was four days without it. F.B. And that's not passing you idiots and I know that most of what's on hand has to go. But what about other items like the flour mustard and eggs used to? Is there any two that the F.B. Now people they fix the, we store the power in their own neighborhoods wherever they work. That's what some would say. Someone says some on the ledges that you know when you work for the company if you know their guys that you know have their power out and they have it to work for the company. They have the power in their neighborhood. Maybe it's just a coincidence that it gets restored real quick. Yeah. Magic. Maybe they know where to stick it. Flower mustard eggs that you're still in refrigerator. Brenda Marty him men is, M.A.R.T. Y. Dash. Brenda Marty him men is. What a great name. Family and consumer science agents for the Broward County Extension Agency at the University of Florida. And the amazing that they're all these agencies and all these different groups and these organizations is just, I don't know. She says when and doubts, throw it out. Don't rely on a person older she says, oh, oh. After all, if you evacuated your home and returned after the electrical services restored, you may have returned away refrigerator and freezer that are purring and food that's nicely children, frozen salad but that doesn't mean that it's safe. Oh my God. If you live in data Broward where the power went out, chances are the food and your refrigerator were in above 40 degrees for more than two hours in addition, the food in your freezer reached above 40 degrees and much of it is unsafe to eat. One way to tell is if the ice cubes in your freezer become a solid block which indicates that they melt and refroes, the same thing happened to your food. You need to evaluate whether to keep her throw out items on a case-by-case basis. Him in his says, and she says, don't call me Jose, him in his either. I'll give you a bitch slap to help you. The USDA Food Safety Inspections Service Emergency Division at F.S. I.S. That's ridiculous. I can't read this whole thing. We've website last time. About 8,000 words on it. Do a search. Here you'll find a chart of food. I didn't send a sunset in any way. Go out in the steel one. Here you'll find a chart of food. That was whether or not there's safe, if held over a certain temperature, or doesn't be in period of time. They also have answer off the ask food safety questions. For example, low fat cheese and eggs held about 40 degrees per hour should be discarded, but mustard is safe. Don't touch the mouth to it. And opens your own mayonnaise held about, oh, don't put no mayonnaise on your corn leaf sandwich minutes for glam. And opens your own mayonnaise about 50 degrees for eight hours should be discarded, but fresh mushrooms are safe to keep. See, there you go. Stay to keep. My shrimps are glad I'm not going to die yet. As our tortillas and peanut butter, what kind of people in this audience have got tortillas in the fridge, right? I wouldn't know. Frozen waffles that it is frost that can be reforzoned as can flour, commercial, or corn meal, and nuts. Oh yeah, you're not freezing the frost many, many times during the course of the lifetime. Also, if canned goods are exposed to floodwaters, even if they look well sealed, they need to be discarded. Can goods and floodwaters, bad mix. All right. To get ready for the next hurricane, he managed to exist taking a plastic bottle of water. You may need to cut the thin neck off, but cut the neck off and freeze it. Place a penny at top of the ice. Then if you return home, I have the next storm and it pennies at the bottom of the bottle, even if the water is frozen, you know what melted. And you'll know the same thing happen to your food, even if it's frozen when you get home. Next Clever? That's very clever. In fact, George is going to send everybody in the audience who's listening right now. Penny, a special collective citizen, Penny, not fortnight of the day's stick in their bottle. Huh?

Oh, exactly. That's because they're civilized and how many incidents of price-couging were reported. Oh, exactly. And I've talked about those gas prices, are you? Well, the good news is now that they can't, not so good news, but anyway, a little bit better than it's been. They can't raise the price on gas like right now. Of course, if they really is a mood point because if they don't have any, your neighborhood gas station wherever you're going, it makes no difference. Because as soon as the new shipments come in, they're gonna raise them about 30 minutes. 10. So for like 279, before it's gonna be like 3, 10. Now, thank you, Mr. President, for those bargain basement gas prices and are ongoing dependence on gas, on oil. Thanks to you and your raghead friends over there in Saudi Arabia.

I don't know. Am I the only one who's perceived that? And he sounds like he's got a mushroom in the mouth? God, he is lame. And even they were given us this solid answer about week category one, and but it would be put above, but all the sudden, baloney. Yeah, crack is what you gave up. Absolutely, crack. And broke up my ass and top it over for a lot of day on my ass, Hollywood's a North Miami Beach. That's where that I was. George is sitting there trying to put his life back together, hoping he'll power come back on. He looks out to window and sees the, oh, the hurricane right over the house. Yeah. Wow. And George lives in Hollywood. Was I didn't know you were old enough yet to live in Hollywood, but nevertheless. Oh yeah, he's working on it. Well, his hair is turning the gray and he's just sporting a beard now as what does it? Great beard. He's a nice old man. Pretty soon you're going to look like, you know who I saw in biography this weekend, and he was really a great guy and I never realized it was Edward G. Robinson. He was a good guy. Great guy. But the only problem was he was Jewish and so when I let the, which hunts and Hollywood happened, that's why he didn't get any work for several years. Edward, do you Robinson? Edward, you Robinson. Oh, yeah. But nevertheless, I just mentioned that in passing. And then later toward the ass end of his life, he started getting a whole lot of work again. Good guy. Any, any, any, not that any. Not exercising a Christian Kutatah, a group of believers, while I was established, scriptures based government, one city, and county of the time. This is kind of like a sequel to a story. I had a couple of weeks ago, remember that? Uh-huh. Jenny, Javi, Naila, Tom's rights. Greenville, South Carolina. Christian Mark, it began as many trips to with the stop at Walmart to buy affordable DVD player. But Mario D. Martinez was planning more than a weekend getaway. He and his wife and three children were embarking on a pilgrimage to South Carolina. I want to migrate and claim the gold of the Lord, so the 38-year-old oil company executive from Pennsylvania. I want to replace this to replicate the statues and more and the more raised in scriptures that the one god of the Old Testament is sponsored of the world. So I'm proud of we just too fast and I'm buttering it. So he's low down and got no spots a lot of time. But just relax. D. Martinez, who drove here recently, to look for a new home as a member of Christian Exodus, a movement of politically-exited believers who hoped to establish a government based upon Christian principles. Oh, and a timely evangelicals are exerting influence on the national political stage, having helped secure President Bush's reelection. Christian Exodus believes that people afraid to fail to assert their moral agenda. A portion of his legal school prayer is banned. There are limits on public displays of the 10 commandments. Gage and Lesbine's can marry Massachusetts. Christian Exodus activists plan to take control of the sheriff's office. As city councils and school boards eventually in a sustainable control South Carolina. But you know what they can have it? Yeah. They will pass godly legislation defying Supreme Court rulings on the separation church in state. See, I'm not alarmed by this. I think that all the Jesus Christ is all these professional religion, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No matter what strike they wrote, they all are like take some useless place like North Carolina that a coders or somebody, a South Carolina, sorry. South Carolina and go there. We're going to force a constitutional crisis at Corey Bernal, 29 and investment advisor who founded the group in November 2003. If necessary, he said, well, succeed from the union. Well, good. Well, thank you, St. Selamis, Sam, which would manise on, right? Let's build a wall of our business. Well, I think that's a good way. Bernal has not moved the South Carolina himself. He promises life they would stay in Valley Springs, California till the end of next year. But believe that his 950 supporters were rallying the cause. Five families have moved so far. Wow. What a movement. Can you smell it? Bernal said his inspiration came from the free state project, which in October 2003 appealed a libertarian, stwoved in the Hampshire for limited government intervention over taxes, greater individual rights. By 2006 organizers had hoped that 20,000 people committed to relocating to New Hampshire. So far, 6600 have said they intended to make the move, but you know how many have done so 100? What an movement. Man. What are grassroots movement? Christian Exodus for now for the will be more successful. There are more Christians than libertarian CSA. Is that a shame? After scrutinizing electoral records and graphic trends in property prices, Christian Exodus members identify two upstate South Carolina counties. They hope they will not officially say which ones as prime for a conservative takeover by September of next year, Bernal hopes that two thousand activists in one county and five hundred and the other. Frank and Tammy Tynoski have said, Linda, a five-bedroom house with white vinyl sliding and new subdivision in rural Spartanburg County. This is where God wants us to be, he said. Oh, I think he got mistaken. I think he wants to, I think God said, hub them in dread. You know where that is? The whole where. Tell him that. Tynoski 38, a self-employed computer engineer had been contemplating moving from his deadline oriented lifestyle and Bethlehem, all Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. What's wrong with that? How could you be more religious than being in a holy town of Bethlehem to a more conservative region with cheaper housing and lower taxes when a church friend had them a Christian Exodus flyer? What attracted me to the movement was the idea of calling back the country to a righteous standard he said. Hallelujah! Put your hands on the Bible and get your other hand off my crotch. His first six months in South Carolina had been idyllic to Noski said not only do his neighbors wave as they pass by but they also share most of his conservative Christian beliefs. I've actually even had flags they put on in front of their houses saying stupid things like he is risen or maybe their cake has risen. If you're going to see this is the place to do what he said. Love locals have that spirit. Although Christian Exodus members are confident they can capitalize on evangelical disillusionment with the Republican Party, local observers are skeptical. James Gooth, a professor at Furman and Greenville studies the influence of religion on politics, doesn't think that Christian Exodus will be successful beyond a county level. South Carolina has a state that's dominated by Republicans he said. Although there are people on the far right edge of the Republican Party in general the population is a big fan of Bush. It's Bush country. Nusseld and the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains upstate South Carolina is the most conservative region of a conservative state. Bush 158% of the South Carolina vote last time and Greenville is home to Bob Jones University a far-bissel and fundamentalist Christian college in and so recently had banned intellectual dating and hates the Catholics like Poison. Cleanest Blackman, all I can't stand guys name cleavis. Remember cleavis forth, or basement the Yankees? No, you don't. The cleavis Blackman treasure and director of missions that they grew back to the association which oversees 39 Baptist churches in Alaska East town. That's the Christian Exodus focus on taking over the government bodies will appeal to the majority of the reasons Christians. You don't find the word control in the Scriptures. He said the basic mission of the churches to proclaim God's redeeming love through the example of Jesus Christ. In other words, kill all your enemies. This is the real life. This is five 16th of the Holy Spirit. This is Mark Morgan is the 12th of one hour on Q8. This is the first time I've ever seen a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's a man who has been in the church. He's rather than a Christian man. How might I do? If we fight again and pray, and pray, and pray, and pray, and pray, and pray. If I come right up for all the Holy Spirit, and pray, and pray, and pray, and pray. If I stand up now, and stand up, and pray, and pray, and pray. If I stand up now, and pray, and pray, and pray. One more time, tomorrow. Q5, 360, WQM, happy Tuesday, August the 30th. I'm not coming, man. His whole summer game is almost over already. That's bad. No, it's good. It went by like a...

Anyway, they were interviewing him. And the broad on the sidelines here. You're going to have broads on the sidelines. At least make them hot. Make them attractive. Make them worth looking at. Because their bubbleheads anyway. They wouldn't know what football if you shoved one up their ass. But this broad on him, and she was nasty looking. Who is that? Do you have any of you who that is? But she have short hair. How to hold the wine. Oh, she's got short hair. I didn't look there. If I said the name would you would it ring a bell? No. Okay. Well, he was tried anyway. Susie Colbert. Oh, that might be it. You don't like the wine? What? What? What's? We're trying to know who it was, but she was ugly man. She was nasty. Look, not as ugly as our president. The federal state and local government. Yeah, we know. Look at that. What is he? Where is he standing? Well, what is all that? What is that? Like a picture of a water behind him? Well, what is that? He's like a little bit of a puddle. Huh? That's a third of a. Another battleship for quite a lot. What one is this on there? We still think we won. Anyway, the grand-degang, we have 20 revolvers. Some of the automatic handguns, shotguns. Some of the automatic rifles. And additionally took computers, laptops. Order yourself a new computer over there. All right, free. TV, stereo system, video games, movie DVDs, and a large amount of pond lawn equipment. Oh, maybe they can open up another lawn services. Yeah. The tech that's believed a box-tad mid-sized truck may have been used to hollow by the stolen goods. The shop owners discovered a burglarly to following morning. Anyone would information about the identities of these suspects and where they were about. Should contact Broward Crime Stoppers. And anonymously, of course, if you've had your life at 9.5.4.4.9.3 tips. Okay. I'd like that. I'd like that. Exploding. Everybody else is suffering in misery. I'm going to say it again. People are new stuff like this. And the looters. All of this stuff. Load our crap away, man. Do the human race of tremendous service. When it's out, I've Pat Robertson would say, Take him out. Or speak in a him. Matthew Robinson, not to be confused with Pat Robertson, says. Then his wife of the seek legal action against Robertson. Oh, right. Maybe they just ought to take him out. To lunch? Yeah, to dinner. Maybe they can take him out with, what's his name with the canoes? He like Wallach. Oh, yeah. Then his wife and prison, Hugo Chavez, said something. His government would take legal action against Pat Robertson. But he would say, Robert's in potentially seek his execution after the US Evangelist called for Washington to assassinate the South American leader. Robert's in a way to a pot. I'm sorry. I could just see that. Yeah. Robert's in a way to a, just like a highman Rothman. Just like my or landscape. He port his ass. Israel. Yeah, Israel will take him. One thing about the Israelis, man. Anybody who'll kiss their ass. Anybody who sucks up to them. Oh, come on in. You know, very sad. Robert's in a way later half-heartedly apologized for the Mark city was expressing his frustration, which Chavez's constant accusation against the administration of President George W. Bush. I announced that my government is going to take legal action in the US to call for the assassination of a head of state as an act of terrorism. Chavez said, a ton of us speech and he happens to be. Absolutely correct. He fired left wing critic of Bush's foreign policy who frequently charges the US government is plotting to kill him called Robertson crazy and a public minister. And once again, he is. Absolutely correct. He said, Venezuela could seek Robertson's extradition under international treaties and take its claim to the UN if the Bush administration didn't act. Robertson, father, they Christian coalition leader of the Christian right that's back Bush said, I'm Monday that if Chavez thinks we're trying to assassinate him, I think we really ought to go ahead and do it. Defense Secretary Ramesfeld, hereby I'm hearing said political assassination was against the law and not the US policy. All the were famous for having done it many times over the years. Relations between Chavez and the US top buyer of the OPEC nation's oil have deteriorated since Chavez survived a brief 2002 coup. He says was backed by US authorities, sounds like Salvador, are you and they all over again? Washington says it's not plotting to kill Chavez and the Eisenvalment and the coup of course. Chavez said, I'm Friday, Bush would be to blame if anything happened to him. In the past he said, Venezuela, the world's fifth largest oil explorer, would cut sales to the US if he was assassinated. A close ally of Fidel Castro, Chavez presents himself or Femba Revolution is an alternative to US policies in the region. Washington says Chavez is a negative influence who uses oil profits to fund anti democratic groups in South America while becoming more thorough at terrain at home. Thank God we don't have authority in leadership in this country, A, in your country. Excuse me. US civil rights activist, why do you get to the dressy Jackson thing?

I mean, they just a little bit too honest for the rest of democratic party for the quizlings, the weasels in the democratic party. John Dean writes, was Pat Robertson's call for assassination of a four-meter or crime question mark and he's got a whole bunch. I'm not going to read all of that stuff because it's very long and very boring about the legal stuff. Just a little bit, little tease and you can read the whole thing on our website. I'm sure. Right, Josh. Right. On Monday, August 22, the chairman of the Christian broadcast network Mary and Pat Robertson. I didn't know her name was Mary and proclaimed on his 700-club. Hey, Pat. Your fairies is seven hundred club television show that Venezuela and President Hugo Chavez should be murdered. Don't forget John Wayne's first name was Mary and two, huh? That's right.

I'm just wondering which one is the bottom, and now that we got all three of them lumped in, they're going to be like a nice Hollywood sandwich. US AFTERN and Strive Hertz AIDS Fights as you an official enjoy HANIS Bruce South Africa. The US government's emphasis on AFTERN is only programs to prevent AIDS's hobbling, Africa's battle against the pandemic by downplaying the role of condoms. All to Pope I bet his PO about this, then Nazi Pope I don't know the woman to evil, look on his face, the mask of evil. Steven Lewis, the UN Secretary General Special Envoy for HIV AIDS in Africa, said, Fundamentalist Christian ideology was driving Washington's AIDS assistance program known as PEPFAR, with disastrous results, including condoms shortages in Uganda. The Bush administration favors prevention programs that focus on abstinence rather than condoms use, and is more than double funding for US AFTERN's only programs over the past five years. As part of George W. Bush's global AIDS plan, the US government's already budgeted about eight million this year for abstinence only projects in Uganda human rights groups be saying, Activists in both of you and the US and the countries now in the group of condoms shortage so severe, then men are using plastic garbage bags and effort to protect themselves. Or you can relate to that, so ran wrap. There's no question in my mind, Duff is a font of AdiSin. There is no question in my mind that the condom crisis in Uganda has been driven and exacerbated by PEPFAR and by the extreme policies that the administration is in the US is now pursuing, and the emphasis on abstinence Lewis told her in listening to her conference, that the sturtion of the preventive apparatus is resolving in great damage, and undoubtedly will cause significant numbers of infections which should never have occurred. Many health experts say condoms are the most effective ballwork against AIDS. The official of the US Global AIDS Coordinator, which administered PEPFAR, did not immediately return calls seeking common. I can't imagine why Uganda had been praised for cutting HIV infections the rate from about 6% today from 30% to the early 90s, a worse success story, and Africa's battle against the disease, but the president of Uganda is government is coming under criticism for sidelines in its condom policy, and moved an activist tie, and the pressure from Washington towards PEPFAR program, and from the folks, and all these other crazy flatt-rath lunatics, the religion is the God squad. High none of the bed, maybe not because of the hurricane, but because the God squad is out there, and they're taking over the whole freaking world, they're crazy that a bed bug, they're dangerous. I'm not used to read about the Crusades in the acquisition, like it was like ancient history, and I was somehow in the past. Yes, again, surprise, look out there. Yeah, my, my, my look out now. What do we got on that pool? I'm trying to stimulate a little bit of a response here today, get these people to 485. We got a shot of 500 day drag before you moved the next time, we might give to 500 votes. No, like by 130. Army contractive fish, I could take some more calls here, but you know something I don't feel like it. Because when we got this week and next week for these two weeks, you know, and I just feel like I got to do my duty, man. That's right, to the pile. Got to do a big pile, I do have a big pile. Look at his geek's get teeth fixed to Japanese flicked, but that's for later on. Army contract official critical, now that's geek's not gooks, don't start with that goofster. Okay, away, that'd be. Army contract official critical of Halbert and Pek is de-moted. You see, this is what's going on in the USA? Oh, look at that gas future, soar. The home this winter, it could be dramatic. One analyst for this pump prices will jump for the 10 cents this week alone. To a national nationwide average of two, 75 of a gallon, and don't bet on the normal drop in prices, following Labor Day, certainly to be delayed this year. How long the higher prices last, the panel on house seriously pipelines and refineries. Yeah, right. Like we're going to get an honest estimate of over. This is just the rape of the public, baby. The rape you're being raped, okay, and supposed to smile about it. You're getting a real host job, man. What a big kid who's taking your gas tank. So host job. Oh, that's the abond bitch from CNBC. She got stolen away that the cat. They hate her like poison. They're on Wall Street. So I said, as Ted, they would about that bit sometime. It was she with Croco, wicked death. And anyway, a top Army contracting official who criticized a large non-competitive contract with a Halbert and company for working in Iraq was de-moted Saturday for what the army called, for a job performance. The official, Boon on teen, eight, green house. What kind of a name is that? It is worth maybe they call him bunny for short. Her, I say. It has worked in military procurement for 20 years. And for the past several years, she had been the chief overseer of contracts at the Army Corps of Engineers. The agency that has managed much of the reconstruction work in Iraq. The demotion removes her from the elite scene of executive service and re-assigned her to a lesser job in the Corps Civil War division. Ms. Greenhouse's lawyer Michael Cohen called the action, and obviously, we've prized all for the strong objections he raised in 2003 to a series of court decisions involving the Halbert and subsidiary Kellogg Brown and Ruth, which has guarded more than $10 billion work in Iraq. We don't understand why we went into Iraq. Well, there is a good part of the answer right there for you. Oil and what was I saying during the early days of the Iraq attack? Oh, I, L, an M, O, any, why? Okay. I'm probably dividing the balls. That's what it's all about. They can't even write a Halbert in which is based in Texas as we know. She's being delighted because of her strict adherence to procurement and procurement requirements and the Army's preference to side-step, and whenever it suits their needs, Mr. Cohen said. He also said the Army had violated the commandment to the layman's Greenhouse's dismissal until they completion of an inquiry by the Pentagon's Inspector General. Carol Sanders, spokeswoman for the Army Corps of Engineers said, Sunday that the personnel action against Ms. Greenhouse had been approved by the Department of the Army, and the memo dated June 3, 2005, is the Demotion was being arranged. The commander of the Corps Lieutenant General Carl A. Strach, no relation to former dolphins, Mediocroquoedabac Donsdrock, said the administrative record clearly demonstrates that Ms. Greenhouse's removal from the SES is based in her performance and not only retaliation for any of the scoges of alleged improbodies that she may have made. I shouldn't say Mediocroquoedabac wasn't a quarterback and not one greasy guy injured from all those Super Bowl years. Yeah, he did just fine. Nice going down, boy. Why is he a good buddy of a man? So don't knock the Donsdrock. He's weak. No one is a stickler for the rules on competition Ms. Greenhouse initially received stellar performance ratings, Mr. Concent, but her reviews became negative. It referred to the same time to be getting a jetting to the decision she saw as improperly favoring Kellogg Brown and Ruth. Often she hand wrote a concerns on the contract documents. A practice that Corly News called unprofessional and confusing. In October 2004, General Strach citing two consecutive performance reviews, Ms. Greenhouse and uncooperative manager informed her that she would be demoted. Ms. Greenhouse fought the motion for official channels and publicly described her clashes with Corbyn General leaders over a five year $7 billion oil repair contract awarded the Kellogg Brown and Ruth. She had argued that if urgency required a no bid contract, its duration should be brief. I didn't like that, but she's getting in the way. You're interfering. You must have all our plans, okay? Just like Tessio said, you must have all my plans. Well, how's Tessio doing? Yeah. But her lunatics, Miniacs, grave robbers, and a public sits back, but it would be better. But about there, what time is it next? You know, we'll, uh, what once the gotty show on again, growing up throwing up gotty. Once the next reality TV show on, they've got, they've got the public so screwed up in a head man, and you people in the media oughta all be on death row, including those grave robbers at CNBC that helped to steal everybody's life savings. And it's just, see, this is the thing, this is amazing. Americans are so passive now. It's like, you can pull any crap over on them that they want. They put up with anything. They've even sharpened it Walmart. Anyway, I get excited a little bit. All right, no, no. And he's the dog days, baby. It's the last, it's the pre and celebrity we can come up. People are interested in getting all been out of shape. They just survived through another nasty hurricane. Another reason to get the hell out of Florida man, get out before it's too late. The tempest brews over quotes on Starbucks cup, did you see this? No, this is what you will now. This is from the ACAVIL times. Starbucks says it was hoping to win Spirworld Fashion Coffee as conversation went and introduced a campaign this year, featuring words of notable Americans on its coffee cups. Sounds reasonable to me. But at least a few of those words are sparking more discord than discussion. An actual Christian women's there. They go again. Those damn Jesus Christ is again. Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ. An actual Christian women's organization is accusing the Seattle-based coffee maker promoting a homosexual agenda because of a quote by Arma Other Armistead Malpand, who's Tales of the City Chronicle, San Francisco's homosexual community in the 70s and 80s. Malpand's quote, one of several dozen in the way I see it from Other Armistead says that it's only regret about being gay is that he repressed it for so long. I surrendered my youth to the people I fear when I could have been out there loving someone. Don't make that mistake yourself. I'm sure. Concerned women of America, which promotes itself as the antifixes of a national organization for women, in other words, they're the national organization against women. And most 87 hundred supporters in Washington say most of those quoted on the coffee cups are liberal. How do you like that? The group believes that corporations have a responsibility reflected diversity that are a way to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to fully be able the people who are able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to have enough Maori.

Boca Brian is going to be very excited he and I both will be the only ones old farts like us old chicken neck. Guess what TV show is coming back. Let me give you a clue. Ralph Edwards you're still on our day yeah oh you were at one slow and who that yeah this is your life an audience favor which ran for nearly a decade in the 50s and 60s on NBC is making a comeback in numbers that ABC this is your life. The original series created hosted by Ralph Edwards was a reality TV pioneer each week I don't try to say reality show only in this case it is reality because it's about real people and there were relatives and people at they never wanted to see again but are forced to define them. Each week a person was surprised with an off an emotional recounting of his or her life by Edwards friends and family. In other words they would you know they would take them somewhere under false pretence like it's going to be some kind of a dinner they were going to walk in and be on stage. Surprise Donna sure this is your life and of course Donna sure was off the road because and this is a true story her real name was Fanny Rose sure okay we're still going to do that because she was being from the deep south she was in various being Jewish okay so when she was on the air and they were bringing all her Jewish relatives and she was going like oh see the you see whatever remember Donna sure no yeah the subject why not the subjects very from celebrities prominent business figures to regular folks we are thrilled and reduced this is your life to a whole new generation of ABC viewers executive and we are wrong said this statement I hope she's like but I think she might be wrong the original series was more than just one of America's best love TV shows it became a cherished part of the american vernacular. Bob Barker this is your life Edwards began to show on radio then moved NBC in 1952 recently mentioned Bob Barker is because Ralph Edwards also started to with the consequences was his show and you know who the host was of food to consequences no Bob Barker I just got you know how many of them and then moved NBC in 1952 made it that worked till 61 syndicate versions there briefly in the 70s and 80s the new show being produced by Fox television and wealth Edwards production Edwards now 92 lives in Los Angeles won't be involved in the series production shows yet to begin to say that I'm not

fact that says oh that's right it wasn't done struck it was Earl Moral and then struck sucked like I said Earl Moral what was I thinking about Earl Moral wasn't he the mayor the sheriff of Davy or something like that the mayor had no huh the sheriff of a okay for nokey swamp whatever he wanted sorry to correct you but the quarterback who's dead and when Bob breezy went down in the perfect season was Earl Moral who later when I became like it says here the mayor of Davy see I told you it was not done struck side I got no light thank you very much you right I knew it wouldn't possibly be because on struck was lame he was Morino's a backup right well he uh Morino took over any three struck was like 70s and early 80s he wasn't there when Morino was there I think maybe for any boy yeah like the very beginning of Dan I remember one time I was in WY and Z and I had done struck on my show at night I didn't want him on a show but he was in the building for something or maybe in the daytime and the uh brought him in they said oh here Neil here's Don struck uh sit down done and have a chat with Neil as I want you doing here you'd boil you silly as you fair shock you silly dumb

women i'm talking about like real pants yeah to point i wonder she's got a they were us gilb span and the evost and gloom rights coutrina's real name let me say it again two words you ought to be thinking about right now as you look at the devastation over there in the warlands and lusiana and even outside your own window in some of your cases global frequent warming two words ross gilb span rights the hurricane that struck the wiziana yesterday was nicknamed coutrina by the national weather service it's real name is global warming when the year began with the two foot snowfall in Los Angeles the cause was global warming when a hundred and twenty four mile hour winds shut down nuclear plants in Scandinavia and cut the power to hundreds of thousands of people in arlan and the uk the driver was global warming when a severe drought in the midwest drought water levels in the Missouri river to their lowest on record earlier this summer the reason was global warming angel i when the worst drought on record triggered wildfires in spain and Portugal and left water levels in frances their lowest level in thirty years i told me the explanation was global warming when a lethal heat wave in arazonic temperatures above 110 degrees and kill more than twenty people in one week the comfort was global warming and when the indian city of bomb bay we see thirty seven inches of rain in one bay telling a thousand people in the strapping the lives of twenty many others the villain was global warming as the atmosphere warms it generates longer droughts more intense downpours more frequent heat waves and more severe storms although Katrina began as a relatively small hurricane that glanced off south Florida it was super charged with extraordinary intensity by the relatively blistering sea service temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico a concept quince is ours heartbreaking is they are terrifying unfortunately very few people in america know the real name of hurricane Katrina because the colon oil industry has spent millions of dollars to keep the public in doubt about the issue the reason is simple to allow the climate to stabilize requires humanity to cut its use of coal and oil by seventy percent which of course threatens the survival of the largest commercial enterprises in history in nineteen ninety five public utility hearing some of the sort of found at the coal industry and paid more than a million dollars to four scientists to a public dissetters on global warming and next on mobile is spent more than 13 million since nineteen ninety eight on an anti global global warming public relations in loving campaign in two thousand big oil and big coal score the biggest electoral victory yet when bush was elected president and subsequently took suggestions from the industry for his climate energy policies as the pace of climate change accelerates many research is fear that we've already entered a period of irreversible runaway climate change against this back around the ignorance of the american public about global warming stands out as an indictment of the US media when the US presses bothered to cover the subject of global warming it's focused almost exclusively on its political and diplomatic aspects and not on what the warming is doing there are agriculture water supplies plant and animal life public health and weather for years the fossil fuel industry is lobby to me to do cordless same way to a handful of global warming skeptics that it occurs to the findings of a runaway intergovernmental panel on climate change more than two thousand scientists from a hundred countries informed of the UN today with the science have become even more world bust and the impacts is visible as the megastorm that covered much of the gulf of Mexico the press bears are sure the guilt for our self-induced destruction with the oil and coal industries as a Bostonian and afraid to becoming with a will like last winter be unusually short and devastating this severe at the beginning of 2005 a deadly ice term knocked out power thousands of people in the winland and dropped a record setting 42 point to which is a snow on Boston the conventional name of the month was January its real name is global warming and a part of it but it would like that that's right we support our president okay we don't care how much he's screwing up the planet we don't give a crack and that's because people are stupid that's basically what it boils down to most people are really incredibly stupid selfish ignorant 141 at five 60 every two way in
