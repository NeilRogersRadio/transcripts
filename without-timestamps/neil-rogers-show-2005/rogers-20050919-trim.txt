I'm sorry like I was in a 10-chan and I come all the way to the end I don't know didn't it? Sorry. How old? That sounded okay I'm fine. No, from where I am. That sounded okay. Hey it's you. That's good enough. That's all accounts. That's right. Yep. What's up you? You a fan. Oh yeah. We're a lucky. They're lucky. That guy, how about my Spartans lately? I'm going to tell you something. That guy was about as lonely as all alone as a guy with body odor and all they write. He's just and you can smell the feet in the air. Yeah. Good. And if the cane's it's starting off. I'd start off owing too. Wow. That would have been, uh, never almost had been like the dolphins losing the jets. Well that wasn't unexpected. Why wait Neil? Why? I'm expected. I picked the game 176 on a year ago. Was it against your last week? Excuse me. Although Kansas City's pretty dang good. Looks like excuse me. Yes. On ESPN. On my selection segment. Yes. The jets are not as bad as they look last week. The dolphins are not, are not as bad as they look last week. The dolphins are not as good. I gave the score. Jets 17. The dolphins six. I was all right. I went to a good last week. They played a half. They were good in the second half and they realized they've endr missed the team. Yes. Yeah. I mean, they had to go to New York where the jets always beat them. Yeah. And the dolphins are not going to have this kind of a year. It's going to be right up and down. Patriots look pretty weak yesterday. They missed the bus also. I picked that too. Boy, they look bad. Really bad. Your friend Tom Brady got knocked around for them. I've done it. I've done it. Of course, the special teams really have stumped. We don't want to. Michigan State. I would have bet you a lot of money. We'd be the big man that they were going to blow that lead. I don't know how well that they actually would pull it out no more time. But they do that all the time. It's like some teams just have this neurotic repetition. They just famous for doing the same thing. 38 to 17 and I thought to myself, if they can get out of the third quarter with a three touchdown lead, then they're going to win it. And of course they didn't. So you're watching a football this weekend. Yeah, I watched a little football. I saw my buddy Tom Brady Pat Quinn. I mean Brady Quinn. Yeah, oh Brady Quinn. Yeah, I know the name. I know who that is. Yeah. But it's not important. At least they made it exciting. Anyway, they pulled it out no more time. Touchdown Jesus couldn't pull it through form. I can't be glad again that you're not here this week. I am with the Brian or even. In fact, it's just a lead to sting that I've printed out here is that the tropical stormy could become as much as a hurricane by the time it hits the keys. Oh, I knew is that right. Yeah, we can get that on our report. Well, I just got the latest and the greatest from your friends at the Harold. So I'm on top of it. Oh, if it's in the Harold, it must be right. Brian and here it's beautiful. There's not a cloud of the sky. It's going to be like 77 today, man. It's just like heaven. All week now. Oh, I have a week arena. I guess. Well, good luck to you. You'll leave it. Thanks. You'll leave it. I don't think so. This doesn't work quite the storm is going to be too much of an impact up here. But don't say that. I know. Don't say that. I got stuck right in the sand at last time. Based on the predictors and the prognosticators. And then of course, they turned out they've got him pretty bad. So don't say that because looks like there could be a lot of people. It looks like there could be a lot of rain. I'll get to eventually here in a couple minutes. A lot of rain and wind. Yeah. Downing trees, power outages. It said we're not like Katrina. Although similar to when Katrina had Florida. Would it be that bad here? Possible. Yeah. Because it seems to be going south. Is that what you're talking about last time we thought it was going to hit Boca. And then it took that little jog. All it takes is just a little bit of a jog there. Yeah. At the ass and then. That's what happened with Andrew. Remember? Andrew was supposed to go north. Yeah. Can you imagine if it would have? Because I said I said out of my part of the time. I said out of my patio. And it was just it was like the end of the world. And that was in West Broward. And of course, you know, it hit the homestead. So one can only begin to imagine. And this rain, Reagan. He's this guy's in knucklehead. I come to find out. He's an idiot. Yeah. When I was people in the concept. They got no power. Most of the place. They got no portable water. They got no nothing. And of course, all the disease and the unhealthy environment. The hospitals are for the most part closed down. The bars are all going to break. I got the bars open in the French Quarter. Yeah. There you go. That's what's important. And they can just get the third grounds open in the bars. Everything will be okay. Oh, speaking of the fairgrounds. Yeah. Here's an update on Gulfstream. Yeah. I talked to a guy who told him who's close to the construction people. Who told me they could work 24 hours a day from now until they're opening. And they won't even have the first floor finished. Well, that's good. Yeah. But I bet you'll bring back Gary Puckett in the Union. Get to sing out there in the banjo. Yeah. That's all I counts. It's like when Hailea went to Brunette. He brought him all those hoochie koochi groups in there. That was going to bring the fans back to the race track. Yeah. And a few people. I'll show you. He said he's not there for the race. I was lame acts and not one person would come into the track. But you know, even lots of the race. They just never learn their lesson. And of course now they're. Your buddy Mike Mayo actually wrote a good comment. I thought it's a slot machine. Yeah. I got a petition thing going and nice going there. My cold and Mayo. That was well done. I read that yesterday. Yeah. Nothing's going to have any impact. But at least you know, it's an outlet for. It's understandable that the legislature doesn't enact what the people voted for. Yeah, but I haven't ever done that. You'll say that the the per mutual people will all do respect to my friends at Toppo Park to the per mutual people are they're wishing out. Yeah. Well, as soon as Judge Mo. So they said to give him the go from Judge Mo. They should have started ordering machines and said, look, this is it. And we're going to go ahead and the things said by July 1st, you need to do it. That would have gotten them off the race. But they did, they're just kind of sitting back. But it would be like always in Florida, you know. I think they're afraid of the governor because he's. He, you know, like well, the keys. The other report that we have received. You can do that again on a busy year. Yes, you're. Goldberg. And gas stations along US one in the key. Look at that. There's your fat ass governor. As long as it's a Sunday, he's off the road. We'll be saying like you said, he's got to help a family. The moment you said that, there came his ugly fat pussy on my TV on CNN. I can't believe that. That is shocking. I mean, he's always for to be. Yeah. And he also, if he ended this announcement about the storm, he's going to say it by the way, if we're Get about the slots. We're going to about the class size. Forget about the bullet train. Forget about the slots. Yeah. How many were they to? They don't lose well. Those people. And the fact is that the public likes him. I still can't forget that. That's what the great mysteries of all time is what a public likes this loser. And it's dysfunctional phony family. The worst. They exactly. I was talking about. One time at a Marlon's game. Back at IOD, I had. I had the season tickets to give me. Like, maybe the first or second season for the Marlon's. I guess the opening season. And my seats were right behind. About five rows behind his. He had the front row boxes. And I was like any orange. Like in a first or second row of the orange seats. And he shows up there with his entourage. With his big fat redneck. I'm not just fun. Where's a guy. It was sitting right next to me. They took up three seats with his ass. And one of his buddies down there was you. You can tell. Yeah. There's that near Roger. And he turns around and looked at me. Yeah. I think this is before he was governor. What have been. Yeah. Yeah. And there he was. Turned around to give me a look that was just killing. I wanted to flip them off. That would have been a bad idea. But I just give him. I just gave him the equal and sour look. Somebody was. We were talking a couple days ago. Somebody was saying that this family. What they're doing to this country. Where this country is going to be by the time Bush leads leaves. We're going to be. The deficit is going to be over 700 billion. And right. And we aren't going to have any friends anywhere in the world. And we will cease to be a power. Yeah. The final. We'll be. Well, we'll be. Now, if you can slot thing over the eight Americans too. So anywhere I go, I'm Canadian. Oh, yeah. You're laughing. But this is the new thing that a lot of Americans said. They actually go out and get like you do a candidate t-shirt or a cat or both. You know, and when they go abroad, especially Europe, they're like a Canadian. How's it going, eh? I'll tell you when you'll lose that perspective from other people. Not to, you know, stereotype, ring. But the minute you get behind a wheel of a car, they'll know you're not. Yeah. That's why I don't drive here. Okay. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, brother. Well, there is that star. I can't believe you. Another big one that come in. Yeah. Just never stops. Yeah. I mean, I began tomorrow. We'll see. Yeah. Well, we may not be on the year tomorrow. Yeah. That's what I'm always hoping for. I'm thinking about 10. 15 comes along. A big gust of wind, big hell, and all of a sudden the tower goes down. But they're a track of time. So I checked doing the investigative work that you would expect for me. I checked that my sources are coming. It looks like it may be true about your leader. So if you're trying to get him suspended anymore, you got like a October about three and a half months to do it till the end of the year. All right. I'm mindless. Spanctions. They always get lifted. I'll be careful. I'm not commenting on that story anymore. Well, why am I that? I threw out the first ball and I'm going to. Yeah. Just like your BS about your buddy there. Do it. Always stick all agree with him. Am I basking and I'm left to hold in the sack. Hey, my money. Hey, my buddy. He's your close personal pal. Yeah. I just want to make one comment because I know I'm sure he's listening right now. And that is, you can't talk about other people's ratings unless you have any. Okay. I'm just mentioning that. I know you. I'm just mentioning that. I'm not really a professional. Maybe? He is in particular. But for someone who's probably listening right now because. I have no right. I has no. Do I. When when you look up the number and it says below minimum reporting standards, you know? Regardless of survival. When it has a minus in front of it, it's not a good sign. It's been going to get me by the way, how about those Panthers. Hey, I think there's going to be a little excitement about that this year. Well. And they're going to be pretty good to me. Yeah. so did the press and see the attendance of the three marlin fillies games over the weekend that was so lame and you know what I didn't look to see what it was it was a little over theory on

trot off the hurricane shutters all that stuff 10 15 at 5 60 WQM developers this listings oh my god You are my God who gave into the world Shered to keep the response He says, be mercy David while he's live on the table Yes not! Evet! I'm actually that weather's very easy. I'll have preventative right now, which is it? Are you kidding? I want to do it. I get to the real thing. Hey Brian, you're fair. Twenty after ten at five sixty WCM. So before we get into the yesterdays the weekend's poor result. You realize we had almost 3,000 votes on the poll of twenty eighty sixty two. Shocking is what it is. Shocking and maybe one of the reasons we're starting to get a lot more votes on the poll is the fact that we put the poll where people can see it. At the top of our website is opposed to way down there on the bottom where Eric had put it all the time. Nice going, Eric. Go have a few sandwiches. Go get a few with those breakfast burritos, Eric. They're good for you. Get your blanched up about 700. So here's the latest on the hurricane situation. Well, it's not hurricane yet. But read a strengthens. You vacuations ordered or planned in San Florida. This is from the here. So consider that residents ordered to leave Key West and the Florida Keys this morning. It signs that tropical storm Rita could strengthen it. Major hurricane is that approaches the region. Oh my God. The National Hurricane Center is telling us there is somewhere. That Rita might reach category three status as it approaches the key. Said our reentoner Monroe County's emergency management director. Our policy is to call for a general evacuation. There is that might be prone to category three impacts. He said the Monroe County shelter. If I use main campus along with South East, along Southwest, eighth street and They'd County will open early this afternoon. Officials in date and Broward were expected to announce partial evacuations later today. Schools who are up in both counties will be closed and Broward tomorrow. That the Harold says that in one sentence and then later on it says, Broward schools are expected to close tomorrow. There you go. Yeah, so it all depends on if you'd rather have the pain in the air. You know, it's just if you don't like your kids just in the school. Right. If you wagon them, they have just keep them home and then George can sleep in tomorrow. Four castors emphasized that Rita showed no sight of inflicting the topic of catastrophe delivered last month by Katrina New Orleans and the adult coast will thank God for that. But, but I look at the pattern here. First New Orleans and now Key West. You see that? I wonder if it has a gate. Yeah, we're telling them. Sure the Pat Robertson will find out. It does. Four castors said South Florida's weather will begin to deteriorate this afternoon. We mean grow progressively worse throughout the night into tomorrow as Rita intensifies into her Canemoo's closer to the region. Oh my God. I'm always independent but I'd be prepared this time. Okay. I'm not going to open it. I leave myself open for Troy Stratford coming in and open up a big, ball-headed mouth and saying, Were you ever done a full people list? Yeah. Go sell something, try it out of my face. You loser. Residents of Dayton Barrow were advised to be being prepared immediately Immediately for gusts that approach hurricane strength of 74 miles an hour from to five inches of rain and for five foot storm tides as far north as Miami Beach, with up to three feet as storm tides through the rest of coastal date and grow. Sustain winds could exceed tropical storms strength of 39 miles an hour as early as tomorrow morning in metropolitan Dayton Broward. Forecast is said downing trees causing power out of just similar to those experienced fewer than four weeks ago when Katrina swept through South Florida. When some of us underestimated because they've passed the forecast to get us blue at big time, no were full of cramp. The situation will be worse in the keys which will experience to stay in Hurricane Forest winds and eight foot storm surge and up to 15 inches of rain. 15 inches of rain. Residents ordered out of the lower keys including key-west this morning and amended to a evacuation of tourists to extend throughout the keys. Schools are closed in the island, shelters for residents will open a noon in Marathon and Alamurada. Residents to the keys were urged to install their hurricane shutters now. Not later now and secure loose objects experts recommend that residents of Dayton Broward prepare for similar action. Next may feel that dottering old fool at the National Hurricane Center says I'm ready to have mine put up with the track shifts. My shutters are already out and sitting by the windows. While I sure hope that you get to it right away, Max. Other than big gust of wind will come along and blow all them shutters away and it could be like flying objects like projectiles. You know what? Give me kills some people as somebody we know would say. Four castes already also warded the possibility of tornado. So great not be an area on. Four castes also warded the possibility of tornado throughout the region beginning to night and persisting through the Marnite. They'd count a mayor Carlos Alvarez and he's expected to announce later today evacuations of county trailer parks and a voluntary evacuation of zone A along with county's coastline. evacuees will be urged to stay with family or friends who live in London. There is no reason to be alarmed but this term should be taken seriously. Alvarez said I think we learned some experiences from Katrina which hits our Florida's account one hurricane but surprised many people with its power. Please stay informed the mayor urges because the one thing we did learn is that you can't predict with total precision exactly where the storms will go. Here's residence to pay attention to storms and tear a cone of probability matches to center line. Watch out for that cone. Okay. Okay. Get a cone. Get a cone. Mighty cone. All of these things.

I'm trying to find this hercane advisory on this tropical storm advisory on reading you talking about slots. Okay figures Well, let's see here we go hurricane Read that proper star weight advisory number This is bad this is a no-o website this really sucks. This is where I usually find oh here it is It's still the 8 a.m. though now how the house that possible Simon's before level of clock We always have these on here before now. We'll have it at 11 o'clock when you're good ready Like you're out there on your way to public and win dixie buying up all the water and emptying the shells from all the Stuff former US president Bill Clinton our hero sharply criticizing George W Bush for the Iraq war and the handling of hurricane Katrina and voiced alarm at this rally US budget deficit he said oh my god breaking with tradition under which US president's mute criticism to the Success as Clinton said the Bush administration is decided to Had decided to invade Iraq virtually alone and before you went and discussions were completed with no real urgency No evidence that there were weapons of mass destruction the Iraq war that voted US attention from the war and terrorism and undermines the support that we might have had Borsan interview with the Nassilis says vorsid. That's not right. This is a where this from AFP with all the Z Atotania who both L is AFP well whatever it is it's wrong Clinton said not Bush you morons and interview with ABCs this week program Clinton said there been a heroic but so far unsuccessful effort to put together in the Constitution That would be universally supported in our rack there people died every day there's a blood bath its chaos It's almost like New Orleans the US strategy of trying to develop the Iraqi military and police so they can cope with you out without US support. I think is the best strategy the problem is we may not have in the short run enough truth to do that On Katrina Clinton followed the 30 state of New Orleans out of the storm struck on August 29 people with cars We're able to heed the evacuation order, but many of those who were poor disabled or elderly were left behind If we really wanted to do it right we would have had lots of buses lined up take them out Clinton said is that what I said That's what you said all those city buses and school buses is not exactly what I said even though I never have any solutions for any problems I do is complaining criticize and I never have any solutions but it sounds to me like I said that Absolutely Clinton agreed that some responsibility for this lay with the local and state authorities that pointed the thing without naming him at the former director of FEMA that could be brownie could it the old brownie how'd Mickey Brown FEMA brought a microwave. We know that when James Lee Witt ran FEMA because he had been both a local official and a federal officially Was always there early and we always thought about that Clinton said referring to FEMA's head during his presidency Both of us came out of environments with a disproportion number of poor people on the US bug you couldn't warn that the federal deficit Maybe coming untenable unacceptable is what it is it's insane They're just like they're printing money like water like paper like black paper Threatened by foreign wars the poster came recovery program and tax cuts that benefit just the richest one percent of the population Included himself he always says that about my tax cut, you know, right that he doesn't need to admit it They need to do it by the way What Americans need to understand is that every single day of the year our government goes into the market and borrow his money from other countries to finance a rack Afghanistan between our tax cuts. You said we've never done this before Never in the history of our Republican we ever financed a conflict military conflict by borrowing money from somewhere else Clinton added we defend on Japan China the UK Saudi Arabian career primarily to basically Loan us every we are there the year to cover my tax cut in these conflicts in between a I don't think in this any sense It's usual he Wish that hand he could hang an hour that old boy Nothing worse than an old person Bill Clinton 79 votes easily in the way man. He's even got Jesus beat Jesus Christ Clinton 78 Jesus 41 Einstein 40 after the R39 Ben Franklin 38 Edison 33 goodbye JFK 28 able a 24 Ronnie Ray gun 23 Michael more 21 love it today. So 13 she was lovely Yes George W. Bush 13 Thomas 10 8 Elvis 7 Cindy she in the words that she hand rhymes with bill free hand Who take of our two Teddy Roosevelt one and none yet for John Adams and Jimmy Hendrix All guarantee a four to 11 votes Jimmy Hendrix will get more votes in John Adams.

I'm watching these missing children this thing that's been put on CNN They have been for last few days and they miss show another one with a name, but age question mark, right? Now I'm assuming that it's the parents or relatives or somebody connected to these kids It's saying these kids are missing. How is it possible that they I don't know how old their kids are? Hmm, who's reporting the missing. Well, just keep in mind these are probably from no-one Leans, okay. I mean you can't complain about the collective IQ of all those Luziana Alabama, Mississippi and Ultra-Win Texas and Oklahoma and Arkansas We'd accept an e-course of a bubble. Maybe he just to hung out there. That's what I heard President of Bush today questioned a plan speaking of intelligence to allow residents to return to the world and saying there are too many concerns about additional footing and safety in the city The city needs to be emerged. He said after meeting his Homeland Security Council. It's a matter of timing Oh, yeah, he knows all about timing and so does Mickey Chirtoff. Bush spoke his residents began trickling back into the city This morning is Friday reopening plan by a lung head mayor Ray Nagan one zip code at a time over the next week the uptown neighborhood By the way, the debt tool all together is like 800 and something right now So the fact that they brought in 25,000 body bags. I'm sure to go over a thousand it would appear But where did they come up with those numbers? I don't know just think I'll tell me you'll need them someday Okay, over the next week the uptown neighborhood the garden district and the historic French quarter Also are said to reopen the residents and businesses at Nagan's invitation bringing a total of about a third in the world In Japan and have an inspect 200,000 homes in the world in the hundreds thousand of them have been are gonna have to be bulldozed Does that give you an idea what we're talking about right? Bush said there's deep concern about the possibility that tropical storm read I just looked you know they have the odds the possibilities and probabilities of where it's gonna hit and when and so on There's a 7% chance that Wednesday evening through Thursday That could hit New Orleans that's like 14 to one in the morning line They're concerned about the tropical stormy to which was headed toward the Florida keys today could drop more rain on the Orleans and breach the cities levees again Those levees man, dammit. We've made our position loud and clear Bush said the mayor's working hard the mayor's got this dream about having a city up and running We share that dream, but we also want to be realistic about some of the hurdles and obstacles I'm having overcome the FEMA people and the president and making sure it often home. I'm super easy all of these things This story here gives me hope. This is the greatest possible an insure a lot of you out there when you hear this story You'll feel the same way there. There's hope for some of us all right Doctor, you want me to read you the headline, okay? U.S. doctors prepare for the first human face transplant. Oh What's not to like man? I bet you there are a lot of us want to sign up Doctors at U.S. clinical start interviewing potential recipients for the world's first face transplant Unless you weeks after winning a parole from the clinics in turn review board the medical team at the Cleveland Clinic at Ohio is led by Maria Simino a 55 year old surgeon who spent years conducting research into face transplant including experiments on animals and human cadavers You want to choose patients of our really disfigured. That's somebody has a little scar she told the AP The procedures intended to help patients whose faces. I thought it said whose feces are disfigured whose faces are disfigured because of an accident or genetic fault in other words ugly parents many patients spend years enduring painful reconstructed surgery It's a process that's been labeled life by a thousand cuts and you're supposed to play I lost the way that where to go Boy, I was slow tell me for false Monday performance of face transplants argue that the procedure could remove the need for years of operations By applying a new sheet of skin in one operation while the capability performed face transplants is existed for years Nobody is attempted it teams of surgeons in Britain France and the US previously announced that they're close to forming face transplants But concerns over the ethical implications of the procedure halted or delayed their plans Although the Cleveland Clinic team is one approval from an internal review board critic saying independently Review board should determine whether the procedure can go ahead last year a team at the University of Louisville and Kentucky Which has successfully transplanted a human hand? They said it not to go ahead with face transplants after examining the ethical issues as thick as a person's self image Socialist sensibility and sense of normal searote outborn widians a philosophy professor in clinical investigator at the University of the American Journal of Bioethics and the same journal Carson's strong a bioethicic University of Tennessee wrote it would leave the patient with an extensive facial wound with potentially serious physical and psychological consequences now doesn't sound quite so good as it did before the operation is expected to last up to 24 hours a skin envelope From a donor's attention to the recipient using one of two pair of veins and arteries and either side of the face about 20 nerve endings would also be attached the recipient should look similar the way they did before the operation the Cleveland Clinic tells potential donors and patients That's because the skin is grafted on or existing bones and muscle which determine a shape of a face Similarly, expressions and facial characteristics are determined by the brain not the product of facial tissue Other researchers however suggest that the final result will resemble a combination of the recipient and the donor So we're gonna have to like scrape some skin from somebody looks really good, you know right like maybe Brady Quinn maybe even like braid Quinn's face I don't know that Josh was pretty impressed by Brady Quinn's performance even though of course the Spartans did prevail in over time after blown a three-thats down lead But he said that Brady Quinn is like almost on the same level with Tom Brady's now, which he said Just as you were asking currents for the race. Yeah, he said do fairie 20 till noon at 2 AM This is new This is five 16 It's day My every town five six oh WQA On the blue chip On this dad gets a shame And the fairies touch when you roll for their And the blue up the back with shame It's a wooded chip and the spells are not like an arm Picked or the bad egg farted with two died of disease They showed them our DNA They're not holding up for the fourth and the longest of the night And if you go play the old North, why would they choose to rush the place of the slaves If they don't serve lawful, but you can see shit they beat it back to you Life is very hard I'm 47 at 560 WF, we got to mole myster with two mad dog of four No, I'm all game tonight. Marlins have a travel day. They're on a way to play the mess in New York tomorrow How many games like in this season Josh? That's what I thought 12. 12 games left. It doesn't the dirty doesn't the big probably got now is not just that they're behind But they got two teams. They got a hurdle over that's bad. They're fully infused in that they have to leap 550 or one votes on a pool. What famous a living or did first you admire most built for him And one was six FDR is hopped over Jesus Well, I'd like to see that That'd be funny right on that chair 57. I'll know I did like that cigarette holder. That was the best Jesus Christ 54. Yeah, Burgess Meredith plays FDR Per Albert Einstein 50 Ben Franklin 49 go fly a kite Ben Thomas in 40 Abelok in 35 Tf 232 Ronnie Ray gun 24 Michael more 23. He have to head of mother Teresa and she's pretty peo to about it Mother Teresa 14 George W. Bush 14. All I see a lot of similarities there Thomas paying 10. Take of our nine Elvis seven city she and five Thomas Jefferson four Teddy Roosevelt three Jimmy Carter two Mark Twain one Timothy leary one John Adams finally got one I must be whoever called him because nobody knows who that is Carl Roe Jimmy Henderson none and how come nobody says George Washington was he like Chopitay is there something was the chop liver? We'll put him on them George Washington man the father of your country Who used to stay to motel six all of them support for the war and Iraq among Americans has tumbled to an all-time low A court a New York Times CBS news pool that came out this weekend and all-time low only 44% of those survey said he wasted the right thing By invading Iraq the lowest rating since the question was first asked by the pool more than two years ago according to the New York Times Furthermore more than eight in ten Americans are very or somewhat concerned that the war is costing a lot of money and resources needed in the US The poor results came as the West faces a bill of as much as two hundred been into we build the Gulf Coast after devastation by Katrina Yadiyadi Yadiyadi your presence promised not to raise taxes to pay for it as Americans also grapple with high prices at the public retreat is after Thanks again Mr. President for those bargain basement for the free gas The pool also showed sharp racial divides and how the wars perceived by Americans only 36% of white Americans felt the war was having a negative impact in their communities compared to 58% of black Americans See when when they say white Americans why they just say crackers because that's what that includes red necks Look a lot of these folks that they're interviewing in Louisiana. I still love the president. He just these my president I love you know, he's doing the best he can you see most you know nearly 60% of disapproval the president The other Iraqi conflict and nearly half of all Americans are not proud of what the US is doing in the war. The pool found all those dead bodies all over the In place all those people including tons of women and little children who still be alive today It's going to be into that brilliant iracatex based on a bunch of lives. You know all of this stuff that this man has done and nobody's even really seriously talking in impeachment There are a few people whispering it around you know not too loud because they don't want to give killed But that's it Compare it just compare in your mind the the white water and Kenny star who was a right wing lunatic compare all of that crap Sexual Tucker Dillos and to this crap well, he's dead people blood on the hands is what it's called Results of the pool were published at the end of where the bloodiest weeks in and around Baghdad since US troops invaded as a wave of bombings and shootings They were there 200 lives. They're all screaming at the end language Here's the Michael Mayo thing that I threatened to read You on it. Are you sorry signing and sending it in somewhere outside isn't it Josh? It's here. Dear Talahazie give us lots of will give you grief rights Michael Mayo hold the Mayo Mike and happy to Shivou is Tishibog By twice a year now that he's not a sports nickname war Mike Mayo where something actually worth reading He says now that Hurricane Katrina's put Mrs. Havey Casino's out of commission for the foreseeable future It sure would be nice if the Florida legislation that it's driving the a proud county voters the spot machines that we approved last March That's a year ago march that's 2004 was a 2005 well whatever was was in 2005 right okay Otherwise the state will get buff because now I like the way that they spelled this in the Sun Sentinel because it's probably right mostly by goiam Buccus which means basically nothing but I don't like the way that spelled there Otherwise the state will get buff because while untacks Indian trap casinos keep breaking in the case Inferencing assertion they said in gambling void in Baloxy and other Mississippi Gulf Coast towns. That's a good point Now that all those casinos those floating casinos in Baloxy are upper creek so to speak Look at all the additional money could be coming it could be pouring in the South Florida But oh no we don't want that we don't want no money for education anything worthwhile Hey those are tainted dollars. It's bad enough the legislature thumbed it's those that voters and the state constitution by not And I think slotted for a barren permutial facilities by the July 1st deadline worse Legislators and it insults the outrage last week by saying there's no need to ease all these you anytime soon And you want to know why my presence the floor in F and way I feel low compulsion to push this into a special session said Repers in a freight actison Republican of Kissimmee head of the House Business Regulation Committee who probably spread a lot of time and check a lucker What is it check to Waka check a logo that would leave things to the courts until next brings regular session The legislature's defiance is especially galling given the states and circumstances with the Gulf Coast casino sideline and winter tourist season approaching its crazy To allow gamblers to head straight for the untacks terminal and make the spooky casinos run the fight Slaughts it to four-borrowed permutial facilities would generate money for Florida public schools the county and local cities A drug in Broward is ruled the trash can launch with county oversight book functioning park pop at O park Hollywood Greyhound trek and Danielle Highlay are proceeding cautiously now wanting to antagonize the legislature that it can pose a prohibitive a prohibitive tax rate later Meantime democracy remains the big loser and by the way, it was at the same people who were to do so badly on the ballot that they didn't say class three slots Which are the biggest star with the ones everybody once and also didn't say that it has to be a by whatever Meantime democracy remains a big loser says my cold a mail every time I do a speaking engagement and a Speaking engagement Michael Mayo is doing speaking engagements And a raise voter asked what can we do just like Al Pacino in the confa remember that what can I do what can I Slept of in the face Here's what we can do pester the powers that be until they no longer can ignore us so here goes says Mike me. Oh, he's given it a shot nice caught Mike. Let's give it a shot Here's a letter dear honorable Florida leader I'm concerned Florida season in a Broward County resident In November 2004 Florida voters approved a constitutional amendment to allow referendum on slum machines in our county last March Broward voters approved the measure for some reason a legislature has not done its part the Constitution said you were supposed to enact regulations By July 1st you didn't we don't want anymore Scuses or delays we approved slots video bingo machines We don't want to hear about what it means for the Indian tribes that's for the governor to negotiate the sort of your job is to set up regulations and taxes Make sure better is get back 92 to 95 cents of every dollar, but take 40 to 50% of the casinos profits for our kids And make sure the casinos are well regulated and treating employees decently We want slots and we want them now sincerely Broward he says if you're tired of being ignored for your name and address on this column and send it by fax mail or email the house speaker Allen's events who makes no sense and sent a president to me and call every day to let the know he Haven't forgotten and then he's got the contact info the address the phone numbers the shoe size a part of your uniform Tree good lucky says good luck to you Mike me on ice job and happy Sinthus Torah so I all you got to do you print that out right from our website or from the Sun sent a few little there We very cautious about that, but you can print it out right from our website the story on there I hope I don't want to be telling these people that every week is on there. Okay, just relax now if you want that race I went to bed for you a big time this morning. I mean, your kids getting paid like four bucks an hour Something like that 250 and they're like oh, but a big enough clearance. He said yes, didn't he? Kind of like hopefully he's gonna dumb you give the affirmative not a while I want to just a bunch of talk, you know, of course, greatly, but anyways, I don't let him go vetoing it Okay, we don't pay any attention to him. Not that we have since he got joist Yeah, you think those of us on the air got joist you ought to see how Greg got joist After you played the fashion, you're some of my contract renegotiation and by the way all the talents gonna sign that Thing I was thinking about the yesterday.

Oh, it's got Mike Mayo's picture on it. They might not like that Whatever you want to do just to take that part in the sign it and send it in or facet in email it in put it in the bottle and stick it in the ocean do something Stick it where would it have you feel like it but enough already with a dragging the feed dragging if you Yeah And I just don't understand where are the people with the balls to say he looked now that I'll give Mike Mayo credit for that All of his just a lucky newspaper guy, but we're out of the powers that beat see this is the problem We're at a people who believe in the you published a you know and in a whole electoral system of course This is a Florida where they keep stealing elections. So what what about how am I talking to right right? Who taught it to myself? But it's your kill some good time. 1156 in QA and bring in some serious cash Is mean This is five 16 Yeah, okay, and there goes again Yeah Great So what do we do now? Shall we is that it?

Let's move on this is Mark Morgan is the 12 to one hour on Q 8 Those are big-rowers closed it in tomorrow and Note Because The lush and dead lights spawned. That tour of the Dalmat, so left on the earth. But even stupid people are allowed to give birth. A stupid, small breakfast, bales sir, walking shards in wine. A man I feel bad for baby and alive. Heaven's the hands-bained. Dance the last never-world. I am faced with tears, but this big swamp will die. Mom's a full of thoughts, star, in swelح our squishyhold. There's no doubt about it she's a bull fat. Are they still watching the same字, and left white to roam? That's right for them. If they still think it's funny, wondering't nearly amount of cold water. Watch simmel house rate can come from a bag. The fun. That's the average day for the loser and the fun. Can't believe they couldn't see. How did it pull it'll pay? Oh, that's probably the truth. You better hold me if my dreams And pray to save Cause that's a dead beast With our many fine And we're going to do a bad, full baby Better life That's a big pop-down last week And as we know, most important story The whole year I was sitting on the right We didn't have to be anybody here Good. That's what we want to do. We have two spots that weren't played Just two amin' somewhere. Are you capable of playing them now? I can. Well, not until I do this, Schools in Dayton Brown will be closed tomorrow And anticipation of Chopperl Stormmakers arrival as a hurricane Evening classes And after school activities And also cancel in both date and And instead again, schools in Dayton Were our closed in Dayton Tomorrow as we wait, Tropical Storm, maybe Hurricane Whatever's going to be the big blow From Rita. This is a meal rush. This is by 16, 18, 18, 18. Oh, okay. So we got all the spots in everything's coaching now. Oh, we're good. Excellent. We're great. Until about before I QAM, We're everything is like all screwed up And equipment don't work in the audio vault And that's because one of the reasons Being the one not listening to us No matter what we told him last almost eight years now But they listen. Oh, they pay attention. Oh, no. We know nothing. They're smart. You know, like Fredo. Jane Fashins says, I vote for Mark Twain. He wrote a book that his daughter wouldn't publish Rears after his death because it Ripferlidge is not so bad called letters from earth. Supposed to be a Satan writing letters To the arcane's old Gabriel By visiting earth. And the stupid religious beliefs of earth In evidence. For instance, all religious beliefs that when they get to have And they'll be universal brotherhood and no sex They'll stand around in white robes and sing Hems yet on earth. All they do is hate one another and scheme And getting sex. They're having certainly isn't what they really want Is it one book every American knows? It is one book every American sure we're along with Talk a very finnist by the strictly use of the in word. Sure, wish I were up there to write a love you Jane. Thanks Jane. Who likes Mark Twain. That's plain. And maybe a day of rain and Johnny's saying to Kimford. You don't have a day of rain. I'll tell you that. Read a proper storm soon to be hurricane read it. Maybe we could add our thousand votes again today. If I'd have pushed it but it's Monday. We don't want to like it. Get pushy right? Because once we start coming, everybody get, Go back to home Depot. Right. Somebody the caller said the Walmart. We don't recommend anybody to go to Walmart. Play. Go to Kmart. Even the one in business anymore. Just go out there and get go to home Depot. Right. There you go. A lot of other choices. Okay. Because we got 592 votes. And we could like, you know, if we've gone over 600 by $1,000 a thousand days in the office. On this pool. Pretty universal pool. I would think. Okay. Some sourfaces. One lack of luckness was barely tolerable. But two more proved too much Saturday for a group of new Swimmers who surrounded the bad weather. Must have been a monster of a storm at luckness. You think? The worst. Oh man. The British are all. God is punishing them perpetually. And rightfully so, by the way. The four men and two women taking turns of an hour each. began their charity. Stunfried. They night and completed their first. Twice we mile. The first day morning. And that was all as temperature. Sank and wind's rose. We swam all through the night and successfully completed one length in 14 hours and four minutes. But the condition was so bad. We couldn't go on. So Kevin Mitchell 56 the first swimmer. The set off on Friday. The waves were so big. And the wind was so strong. We couldn't keep the escort vote with the swimmer. And then made it unsafe to continue. British nature is an organized disponsent relay to raise money for cancer research. You can't. But the naked swimmers of luckness. Couldn't get the job done. Let's see. Here's a fact. Let's see. Oh yeah. How does that safety safety safety? Bichfield about voting for Bush now that you see. I enjoy chair right. And here's one that says, are we blessed down here? This is from Eric. You're right. I forgot about that. We sure are blessed in South Florida. The hurricanes, the canes, three canes. So we had to go three over times to meet like a, not a girl school, but like, a little voice school. Fumson. Yeah. And then of course the dolphins yesterday who like couldn't score in a fixed game. Man. The jets like to feel it had trouble sticking in there. And the ball too says everybody all together. We love you. Dough and we're talking Super Bowl. Baby yeah. We're talking Super Bowl after yesterday's tremendous performance. I'm going to tell you any team that's got just for rotis quarterback and downtown Ronnie Brown or rookie. Well, you've got to wait for what's his name to come back? You know, Ricky. Ricky. Ricky. Ricky. I see he's got like three more games to suspend the sentence. And he comes back. Yes. He could. I think they've won their game to be very honest. You know, that's second idea. They're just Denver vanished. They just didn't come out on the field in the second half. And anybody had any thoughts in your mind that this was going to be a dynamo. I'll let crap we were hearing. And of course it happens there every year. Usually they went the first two or three. And then they just go in the tank. This year was just one half a ball. Let's all they played. One half a ball. Five six seven. Let's get two three thousand more names on the pool. They're going to get some votes. They're just waiting to find their favorite on there. Like you reach your Franklin. Somebody like that. Five six seven. Six. Five six. And he've arrived in a regular wireless line or Jeffrey Dahmer. Maybe. How many Q a M. Hello? Your Neo. Yes sir. After that, we've been hurricane games Saturday. I hate to say it. But just be going to be all about the. Yeah. Yeah. Come in to Q a M. Hello. He had a good one last week. Why didn't you quit while it was ahead? Yes sir. Ben Franklin. He's on there. He's on there. He's all. Okay. I'm sorry about that. Don't worry. Excuse me. Okay. Great. Good American. Now, Jeff Bush. I want to give you that. He doesn't want to talk about his family. But yet he interrupts Michael and Terry Shival. And their business by. Right. And he's going to point. When he has a few. There you go. Now, one thing. Sometimes, though, my thunder on the Kimball camp or television show for the pre game. Somebody say, obviously, called it. We're acting like our day. If I hit them and asked, Neil, you're studying a meaway green on the words. And he was a secret. Jeff's fan and everything. It was great. Good for you. Good for you. All right, Neil. If you can get anybody else to call and tell you what I heard and type it up, you're going to laugh your ass off me. Okay. I like that. Okay. Thanks a lot. Last mile. My ass. Oh, dot dot dot. Why the accomplishment? Wow. How do you like that? Three hundred. We're better. I'm really. I'm really. They probably were crawling in that household. You know. The actual hurricane center has four casted two intense. If I rather rather rapidly, in fact, as we take another look at the track, you'll Oh, boy, he was. We're looking at the potential for this storm to reach category three string. Oh, that's not where it's going. In a go. And come on. We're going three and it's going to intensify. And it's going to go somewhere. You know what I mean? I see it. It's starting to move out there. And the middle of the Gulf. And then it can go north of where young man or Oh, boy. Let's go. It would not be something if we were reading and say, Hey, I'll come back now. come back now y'all come back and they're coming back home. It's already back today and guess what a lot of being there we go again You know what I'm saying? It's a little premature valuation. I think that most of these people I mean granted They're under tremendous hardships, but they're hanging out somewhere to reheust in there in baton Rouge They're urban hella are just let them let them be for the little while what if he's ray you any you quizzing you bozo You're fair right that too. Can't handle him So eminently I'm qualified. That's what he's got to comment with Bush and with the governor, Louisiana Cateline the queen and a lot of these people eminently and with Mickey Brown downtown the mow brownie Unqualified that's the word totally and eminently unqualified So if anybody really believes that your country is gonna like take care of you safety safety safety safety Well if we have like some kind of terrorist attack Neil God forbid good luck you no chance not minimal chance no chance How many Q a m hello? Yes, sir. This is John Ellis Bush Cromba where'd my fair? WM hello Q a m no yeah Listen why can't the bear mutuals that are down here? I read that Michael mail article as well Why can't the bear mutuals why they being so tentative and tiptoe and around this legislature? Why can't they sue them full fledged? Because the voters voted on this stuff when you know the interesting part of it is they did go to court and judge mo Said he gave him the go we said go ahead.

It's just it's like a joke, you know if you want to get put around like for one day and said okay surprise April Fool She's obviously doing someone with that eyesight. Oh my god even the thought of that is so gross test. I can't Can't even begin to think about that especially at launch time email suggests government to seeking to blame the world in his club on environmental group Study like that Federal officials appear to be seeking proof to blame the flood of New Orleans on environmental groups document show the Cleary and ledger has obtained copy of an internal email the US Department of Justice and out this week to various US attorneys or offices Has your district defended any cases that behalf of the US Army Corps of Engineers against claims brought by environmental groups Sickening the block or otherwise impede the course work on the levies protecting New Orleans if so please describe the case in the outcome of the litigation Cynthia Magnus and I spoke swimming for the justice department said there's they she couldn't comment because it's an internal email Showing a copy of the email email David bookbinder senior attorney for Sierra club remark Why are the Bush administration officials trying to smear us like this because that's their speciality man Smear and smear on by the way speaking of smear the word is spelled B U B K I S Michael may own up US Totally his U of his week. He was probably the editors there. Go in book is V U B K I S got it. That's what the Josh and George are making book is right The Sierra club another environmental groups had nothing to do with a flood in that resulted from hurricane Katrina that killed hundreds He said it's unfortunate the Bush administration is trying to shift the blame to environmental groups But it doesn't surprise me at all he'd be saying federal officials say the email was prompted by a congressional inquiry But wouldn't comment further It's too embarrassing whoever's behind the email may have spotted these September a issue of national review online That trans tries to see or club other environmental groups for assuming to halt the course 96 planned a raise in four to five hundred and three miles that he misses to be river levies and lose the animals to be an Arkansas The course said the litigation 97 a green of hold off on some work until and Environmental impact could be completed the national review article concluded whether this delayed directly affected the levies that broken in Orleans is difficult to pass your tain The problem with that conclusion the levies that broke causing the Orleans to flood weren't Mississippi river Leveries that were levies that protected the city for like concentrate train Let me down the other side of the city when Katrina struck the hurricane push tons of water from the Gulf of Mexico Intelliq Pongetrain which borders the city to the north core officials say the water from Lake through the levies by three feet It was those water waters. They say that caused the levies to be greatly ruptured causing 80% Norlands to flood Both find it said the purpose of litigation by the Sierra Club others in 96 was where the core got the dirt for the project We had no objection to levies he said we said just don't dig Fill materials out of the wetlands we get the dirt from someplace else If you listen to what some conservatives say by environmentalists he said were responsible for most of the world's Itals in 1970s seven the core wanted to build a 25 mile long barrier in gates system to protect the worldings on the east side Both environmental groups in fishermen are posted projects and would choke off water in the lake punch entrain After litigation core officials abandoned the idea deciding said to build higher levies They came up with a cheaper alternative bookbinder said we didn't inject a raising levies Same old craft lame somebody else in this colony about how some idiots in the median a few of the bushworkers out there Oh, he finally took the responsibility to buck stops here. Yeah, right after all a political damage in the fallout and Carl Roe said you better get on there dummy And open up a mouth. I still let know what it means So he did the boy thing well it doesn't mean anything and today he's on there And he's given us some of the dance about how Ray What in the mirror and Nagan is an idiot? We already know that Always trying to point in no matter how much you may have taken those three seconds that moment to reassute that he was forced into making about I think responsibility that's the end of that because he's never taken responsibility for anything including showing up for his national guard duty He is a draft dodge in beard guzzlin Coax norton lying second crap coward and He still sits up there mr. High shot on his eye throwing every time to get a chance to stick him on here Then what the one great article we had oh, yeah, they shoot news anchors. That's long.

It's sitting and then you turn on CBC which there I'm struck by the way So then they had a lot of their good news people but even even so are the BBC and he gets the real news of what's happening You have to see the way they carve bush and ask up here man They just ain't too crazy about him.

about to hurt him stuff, I can't learn a 10, Nina think in Los Angeles weekly they shoot news anchors don't they, at first only CNN appeared not to have thoroughly read the proverbial memo, it was the only network on Aaron on its website to compare and contrast the wildly contradictory statements by federal state local officials sometimes with an hour is but often within minutes of each other, it was CNN that posted the first full transcript of New Orleans Mayor Ray Niggins for affinity and passion fields September 2nd and everyone local radio, it was also CNN the first exposure to the gruesome nature of the conditions at the superdom and the conventions in the hospital corridors, it's broadcast used with the first step to keep a heartwrenching online blog during Katrina, even as late as September 6th political correspondent Ed Henry was the first account of the claims by House Majority Leader Tom Belay that local officials and not the feds were to blame by reporting that congressional Republicans in a secret confab were giving the Bush administration a big fat F then the fix was in on September 8th CNN anchor right Kira Phillips was chewing in the House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi I saw that for continuing to criticize the administration and criticize the director of FEMA, I think it's unfair that FEMA is just single out there are so many people responsible for what's happening in the state of Louisiana instead of smiling through claims to use the San Francisco Democrat but back I'm sorry you think it's unfair but I don't if you want to make a case for the White House you should go on their payroll by September 12th even the White House submitted a FEMA and its own disaster area by pushing out its Arabian horseman turned Jack as head Michael Brown Bush finally admitted on Tuesday that the buck was going to stop with him whether he liked it or not to the extent the federal government didn't fully do the job right I take responsibility he said that same day CNN's parent company time worn around the harbing of delays to you for staff as a top Washington lobbyist this news and its timing prompted Jeff Chester of the Center for Digital Democracy to tell the LA weekly time worn a were lining itself with the right wing delay machine to change and send shutters down to CNN HBO clearly TW wants delay insurance who won't have to face

narrated disturbing images of the poor the minority the age of the sick and the dead and discussed complications like poverty race class informant in ecology that never make it on the year in the swift boat anti-game marriage Michael Jackson media side show era so began a perfect storm of controversy contrary to the script you're so often quoted in these areas of Louisiana Mississippi the TV newscaster is new the truth but the truth did not sit them free because what's the crisis pointed past most TV journalists went back to business as usual their choke chains yanked by no longer in the ten apparent company bosses who fearful of fallout from fingering w for the female a screw-ups decided yet again the sacrifice community needs for corporate greed two quickly Katrina's wake was funded a web of deceit by the bush administration that disseminated by the big media boys club call rose spent the post-urricane weekend conjuring up voice to shift blame if big media looked like they're popping up w's presidency they are because doing so is good for corporate coffers in the former government contracts billion dollar tax breaks regulatory organizations and security favors at least that why the old cadre summer redstone had a via company a CBS has admitted what everybody already knew is true that while he personally may be a democrat it happens that I vote for via comi says via com is my life and I do believe that a republican administration is better for media companies than the democrat what when it comes to NBC's parent company G.E.E.E.E.E. is number one in two Jeffrey email that Bob Wright or a five republicans is her time-orders dick Parsons and CNN newscorp's group of murder don't forget that murder number two Peter Turing and Redstone's code number two less moon visit of our democrats its meaning is because we're not in redstone are the owners lots of pot of time large corporations in the executive typically avoid any public discussion their politics because partisan positions alienated customers in employees but all of that changed after G.E.E.E.E. bought NBC in 1986 for seemingly eons it melts predecessor the legendary jackwells was a rabid right winger who boasted openly about helping turn form or liberals christmas and ten rusard in neocons and lost angel is representative Henry waxman is still waiting for G.E.E. to turn over those in house tapes that would prove once in for all whether well in 2000 ordered his network in cable station to reverse course and call the election for bus instead of gore as for him out he publicly wishes his MSNBC could be a clone of fox not surprising since he led his never in cable news cheerlead the run up to the wrecky war what i'm not even bobbing to tell you is that G.E.E.E.E.E.E. had billions in

post-cifried images newsers were heavily weighted once again toward the powerbrokers and the predictable the angry black guys were gone the lying white guys were back hogging all the TV airtime so

The keys is early at tonight into tomorrow. So the hurricane morning continues to march into the Bahamas for the Florida keys and even lower sections of Miami, David County. We have a tropical storm morning that's all right. Do you feel beach in Florida because tropical Sanctation are likely to be felt fair into South Florida. Now here's a look at the track and notice the change in intensity. What's happening is we did is coming into some very warm water. That's not going to face some strong upper level winds that would help to share it apart or break it up or diminish it in any way. The opposite effect is actually going to happen.

You can't eat this. I don't like the water. I am not going the weather. But nobody knows me. I'm just принцип on the water. But I should have eaten many more and I would be down there work on it later. I'm a little bit bodybar, I'm feeling it to the red, but they wouldn't touch it. I'm feeling it on. I'm in the mirror, so I'm gonna take you off. But you can't make up your mind. Let's go on here. Red Amar! Monica! I am waiting to stay in no way. Am I being funny? What's the silence? I am very hungry. You need to brush the sand off my knees. It's the all-new sub-lebrate survivor. When she nights on CVS. So, for little alien, I need to even he wanted our day down. Did you see that? I see that. 7669 votes. 1 famous living or dead person you admire most. I think it's pretty revealing the people are getting at least votes like John Adams has got up here. Bill Clinton 148, Jesus Christ 80, Albert Einstein 69, FDR 68. Did I say Ben Franklin 64? A Blinken 50, Thomas Edison 146, Jad K40, Michael Lorthirty 1, Ronnie Rageon 29, melted to research 22. Oh, she was so wonderful. Thomas Jefferson 19, George W. Bush 19, oh boy. Chagavara 17, he's what on Bush's ass. Tom Paine a dozen, George Washington 11, Cindy C. Anne 8, Jimmy Carter 7, Elvis 7, Todd with Jimmy Carter. We're seeing together. Mark 26, 10 he rose above five, Jimmy Henry's four, Timothy Lery 3, put those two together. Carl Rove, two John Adams, two, and none yet from Peter North or Leonardo da Vinci. You probably in order to caprio. How will he say I say oh no chance? Read rain from read his outer bands already, pelting, rowered into Miami. Says the essential. Look out to where I'm looking out to winter, what's sunny to me? I don't know. It's beautiful. Tropical storm morning issued for Howard and Palm Beach County's which can expect one to three inches of rain. Well, what's the big deal with that? All right. Now, like I said, it's going to be the end of the world. I'm not saying anything that's going to put, I don't want Troy Stratford coming in there on Wednesday or Thursday. I don't know. You said this and you, okay. It's going to be bad, Troy. Just like you're planning to run back. Bad. I've never clocked this morning. We had winds of 65 miles in our predicted to become a hurricane. Missouri is five o'clock this afternoon. System was about 195 miles. So he's been asked about four hundred and thirty miles. So I think he's to keep West. God is really p.o. That these are party places, man. Too many party people and God is going to if it takes five, ten, fifteen of these to get you the message. Howard schools announced no classes will be held tomorrow. And notice his been, oh, look at that. Now the sun sent us as well. No decision to been made yet. They tell him might follow suit as a stands to see if the five inches of rain. Well, that's not what the Harold says. Harold says no school in vain or Brower tomorrow. And a sun sent us to see this is the problem. How do you get information when to give you your conflicting information? Palm Beach County's also made notice in says the Ken K. At the Sun Sentinel was the on K. Posse USA. Data was placed under her cane warning as well as the flood watch. As the county still is waterlogged and cleaning up after Katrina. About 134,000 coastal data residents, many of them in the beach and keep his cane under voluntary evacuation orders. A tropical storm warning was issued for Broward and Palm Beach County's risk-human expect one of the throens is the rain most of it arriving during the late tomorrow. Most of it, anyway, will be here tomorrow. Be gone by Wednesday said Jim Lushine of National Weather Service and my mime and egg rate name. You have his changes in Jim Sunshine. That'd be some. Or Jim Shushine. Broward and Palm Beach also could see gusts to 40 miles an hour. Marginal travel storm conditions, Lushine said if there's good news, read his movie, almost 12 miles an hour. A fairly risk-clipped compared to Katrina's. It's a different law. Read his movie, almost twice the speed is Katrina's. It'll be through here in less time, you see. So I didn't like that to Sun Sentinel say no school and Broward dates thinking about it. Well, that's not what the Harold said. Who do you believe? Who do you believe in? What do we know? Nothing. With South Florida hurricane warning, it's trouble stormy to gather strength. Most major insurers have stopped writing new policies because you see with insurance companies, it's not important anywhere we're catching. It's important that they just take your premiums and that's it. Most companies will maintain the van until the warnings and watches are lifted. Citizens property insurance, the state run insurer for homeowners who can't buy insurance in the private market, isn't writing new policies throughout the state. They farm all state and nationwide. The three largest private companies, Discovery Home is in auto-insulta. Generally, we strict new coverage as soon as the warning or watch the issues for a fourth of the state. Flood insurance is available to the federal national flood insurance program, but there's a 30-day waiting period for coverage to start after homeowner purchases to cover. So they got you by the short hairs as what a bull's down. Just take a while to take care of you because God forbid they should actually have to pay. Can you imagine what's going to happen there in the Gulf Coast? Yeah. Well, don't have to lag it. I'm expecting it. I'm trying to talk about the insurance company. Yeah. Works 30-day. We got our lead. See, how can you have a pool about Carl Marl. What kind of a stupid ass pool is this? A bunch of Carl Marsson L. Castro Hugo Chaud. Carl Marsson L. Castro Hugo Chaud. I'm surprised that Clansman hasn't called in, but that Clansman's name, whatever way. Oh yeah. David Duke. No, David Duke's Kiss and Cousin. Whoever that had that was. We're going to make 800 votes on here today or what? Yeah. Really, 791. See how it dropped down as soon as I started the home about the reader. That was the end of this show. They're busy. They're running away to public. They're running away to win dixie. They're running away to 711. They're running away to you, totem. They're running away to like what you call it. Thank you for having a lot of business. They're running away to extra so they can pack their own. That's just, it's just, it's just in Europe. Most of the countries you have to like bag your own groceries or bring your Bring your own sack. Yeah. I've told you about that. Like an Albert Hein, Albert Tiny, and I'm still there. You bring your own sack or they charge you for a bag. Yeah. Well, that's why extra didn't go over the American public isn't going to put up for that. Can you imagine if they started in the supermarket? Oh, well, you've got to like either bring your own sack or a pay for your bag. I go to a place where they let me bag my own. Really? Yeah. It's not a supermarket though. You see what I mean about this guy? Always comes back to the same two things. I'm not really sure which is first. Bag in it. Yeah. He's the second and bag in it. 567. 560. I know it's right up there by that barber shop right around the corner. 560. I don't know why I always say that. I just made it up from name and stuff. It'd be like if it was near. You'll find somebody over there. He's got a good machine, man. Someone to QA and who not there. Oh, this is bad today. Someone to QA and men to the world line. Hello. I like that. You know, you could hear a radio accident there with a shot Hannity. I think I frost my ass. Yeah. He's bringing. He's talking about how they were blaming Lyndon Johnson back when he was an office because of the nonsense of the ladies and the. And the left way concerned the conservative brigade. They're trying to protect the environment stuff. I'm like, you go back to Johnson. What about this moron. 4 or 5 years ago taking the money from from the ledger project to. For local prostitution and. Yeah. And then looking for looking for the war taken. Guiding that. He didn't bring up stuff that happened two three years ago. It brings up things that happened. Well, money is to check yourself for that. Yeah. Hey, I could tell you that. You sure it. There's short. Randy was in. We already have. Whatever. Yeah. Yeah. She had tapes on and then of course the barlem's game. I'm not going to listen to the barlem's game. Well, God forbid. And. So I'm so 90 was what it was. And you know, I'm listening to you guys. I listen to radio practically every day like. Like, David 12 hours today while I'm at work. Well, thank God for you. Here's one guy that still sticks with radio. Radio is pretty much a dinosaur. Here we have a week. We need badly every morning. You guys are talking and you get a D. E. B. S. nonsense right in the middle. You haven't across up with Hank and all the hairs. What the hell's going on? It always happens to you. They said, wait, get me with me because everything is an answer. This is a way getting back. I said, I'm going to hurt my attention. My life. I can't hear it any way. So what do I care? I'm going to sign up. George, give me a sense. You. A package. Good. Yeah. What? You have no idea what I'm talking about. Some CDs are sent you in the mail. Oh, yeah. Yeah. You didn't like them all. I must work out of a loophole. Your response was that. I didn't know what they were saying. All right. Have a good weekend. Thanks, family. Maybe something like that. I don't know. Maybe something like that. I don't know. CDs and then we're doing. Can't get to CDs. Yeah, I got them. And they were good, but I forgot what they were. Yeah. Oh. All you kids listen up there. That goes to show. I don't smoke that wacky weed. Okay. Your memory will be shot. I'm supposed to be the old fart with the Alzheimer's disease. You're supposed to be dismissed. You're a hot shot middle life. Whatever. Expert on crap. I probably haven't even listened to him yet. I don't know. Yeah. Well, I heard they were great. Hey, listen to the good guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. Okay. Oh, I believe in him. Just like he did with that kind of sense. The awarding on a website. Frosted that guy. Zass, we never heard another word. He saved our ass. He kept that Eric out of jail for me. And all of them in May's food. This is new Rogers. This is 5. 16. 8. Ah, this is Joe Bowen, the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs. And you're listening to the hockey authority. Neil God. Do you want to be all that you can be? No, good. Then you have the metal to become a soldier in the new. You're lucky, Army. All right, ladies. Today we will learn the military hard. So, through with mobilization and individual tactical estimation. Also, no less. Why did your pants end running away? Join now. And begin nine weeks of basic training in Sandokin. Where you'll learn the skills you'll need to be in a wrecky soldier. All right, soldier. Sound off. Excellent. Ah, thanks. Thank you. Thanks for having such an amazing new year, Rocky Army. We surrender more before 9 a.m. And most countries do all there. Isn't it time you became one of the few? The proud. The ill equipped. This is my white flag. There are many elected but there's one. My white flag is my best friend. Without me, my white flag is useless. Without my white flag, I am useless. The new. You're Rocky Army. We're looking for a few good men. But we'll take whoever happens to come along inside of him. 27. 20. 1, 2, and 5. 60 WQM. So, when we don't believe that, they don't know bunkers of the Sun Sino. I stole that. That's eight. They didn't grow out of cancel school tomorrow. See this is what the Harold says. They just declare, if I can't believe this hang in that. Anybody who rely on this station for information because they'd have to be crazy. But anyway, schools in Dayton, Grower will be closed tomorrow. You're what I just said. Close tomorrow. In anticipation of readers or rivals or hurricane. Both districts also cancel tonight's evening classes. Sports and extra curricular activities. After school care, we'll operate as scheduled in Browd, but we can't hold a canceled in date. Or district leaders as parents to pick their kids up at the end of the class. The end of class. Monroe County, where schools are closed at aable, or main close at least through two day. Catholics will operate by the arts dices. They might be reclosed tomorrow on a followly local district's lead. The rest of the week has folks will be said. A little rest of those alter boys. While much of their relief for that. Read is expected to go into hurricane later today. It's Iowa's forecast to slam across the keys early Tuesday to slam across the keys. Who wrote this Matthew Pinser? I wonder if he's related to Eugen Pinser, who drives it that wins a raceway? Tropical storm force wins at least 39 miles in our forecast nearly the Palm Beach County line and school buses can't safely operate in Wednesday or 35 MPH. Moreover, evacuations in the keys and ball today, evacuated orders for coastal date could require numerous schools to open their shoulders. University of Miami closed at noon. Remain closed tomorrow. No text will say, you and of course, what's new about that. FIU will close the three today. Miami dated two and same time as the University of 130 or about four minutes ago. All will still be close tomorrow. That all schools in the day and browse closely. You got that? Don't pay any attention to the sunsignal. They're talking to their, uh, Brad Pitt. Like Tom Dick at us. Survey shows more and more women experimenting with bisexuality. All right. Do you see this? No. On our website, more women, especially those in their late teens and 20s are experimenting with bisexuality over these field more comfortable. The first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that the first thing that's been happening in the early 40s, is that they're in just 10 years man, you see this is in the day got, what is that VDI Bob Bar? Of which have shown themselves not to be terribly fiscally conservative over the last several years. So their track record is not good on this, and I think what's going to happen is you're going to see, unfortunately, a lot of deficit spending, which simply then puts off the payback for all of that money, there you go. By even a little Bobbie Bar there, when at the Nasty Mustache, Hitler Jr. for women in their late teens in 20s, the percentage rose to 14% of the more recent survey, about 6% of men in their teens in 20s said they had had at least one same sex encounter. 6% there are a lot of more liars. While those have conducted the survey, to measure to protect respondents privacy, researchers say it's unclear whether the figure from men was lower because they're more likely to avoid same sex experiences, or whether they're not reporting them, not reporting them, that's so low-interruption. I mean, even if just you were a countryman, we'll report there, so we'd go sit up about 20% on the appolar's assault. It wouldn't surprise Catfowler or 27-year-old arts student who dates both women and men, if men were less likely to talk about their experiences. There's a certain higher level of discrimination for men, she said. It's a lot easier for women to have these kinds of experiences and be open about it because it's more accepted. She attends the University of Florida, she is a gator. The findings on bisexuality, L.S. by Tho American, sexual habits were taken from a national survey of family growth, which included 12,000 evidence, 71-in-person interviews, then for March 2002 to March 2003, overall, researchers said that researchers that most people have relatively few partners are in a low risk for sexually transmitted diseases. Instead of just anecdotes and stories that raise people's anxieties, I think it's best to have real numbers said, where do you measure the statistician who oversell the report? Now we have those. I wonder if he's kind of gary-mojured, grabs annoying, but not well either, by the way. When it comes to women in same-sex relationships, most researchers said it would be worth studying why young women seek sexual relationships, and whether they may be trying to avoid diseases more commonly spread through sex with men. But some experts who study sexuality, that many college students simply see experimentation, is a right of passage. Yeah, what's wrong with that? Pretty quick. If what? He's a college student. Touched down Jesus, and of course being Catholic, you can be damn sure when he's in a horny as hell. He's very safe in the academic community. No one thinks anything of it said, Elaine Rapping, a professor of American Studies at the University of Buffalo is written about sexuality. He's Rappin it. But to some extent, there's more talk than action she had in noting that the bisexuality levels become a badge of courage for some college women, even those who date only men. Meanwhile, she said men who have same sex experiences are often less likely to talk about it, perfectly. Yeah, the trend of... The trend among college women is prompted some sexual behavior, I suppose, to lightheartedly refer to the term, log or less-beated-till-graduation. Do you hear that before? Log? No. Log. I'm going to go, log-order. Less-beated until graduation said Craig Kinsey, a neuroscientist at the University of Richmond, who studies the biology of sexual orientation in gender. In other findings, the survey said that about 10% of females age is 15 to 19 and 12% of males had experienced heterosexual oral sex but not vaginal intercourse. While no earlier date were available for young women, percentages for young men and 92 were about the same. Those numbers dropped substantially for people in their 20s were more likely to have had vaginal intercourse, of course. At that point, that's a such enough of that filthy stuff because we don't want to get Joyce, including, exactly. You know, Frank Ritch, not fat rich, or a thin piece, but Frank Ritch has got a really good calm here. And it's long again from New York Times. But you see the good thing is that now that like the color said before, the time has got to think whether charging you to read the most of their calmness or everything. We don't want you out in Steffi-Watton, 4-Cout-A-49, Bucks are whatever 4950. So I laid it out. This is an out of value.
