if there's a fuck I smell it the door door door door door morning if there's a fuck I smell it I don't care if I never know where the weather got by I thought I was going to come up first time or not but I just wanted to make sure oh I didn't hear you the first time ah there he says it was good thing I came back for a second time yeah guess who died guess who's dead yeah you know who that is? constant more somebody else died somebody else died somebody else died too she was a actress and singer star they string a WW2 era movie musicals and was buster crabs co-star and the 39 buck rider serial it's been 84 before my time oh come on but buster crab you got to remember him yeah the swimmers is crabs right she was also in Broadway musicals in the early 40s hey yaddi yaddi yaddi yaddi she had a Dallas radio show she was in delightfully yours with Jane Powell with the big boobs member Jane Powell and she was in the audience and she opened us with any canter and George Murphy member Eddie Cantor and either Cantor either Cantor I'd love to spend the shower we're talking to you about L.J. Wilson and Delary Parks and the Jansinger yeah that was about the only thing Larry Parks ever did Dennis O'Keefe and hit parade of 47 with any Albert without the pig she also appeared with Rima Land and William Holden the wartime dream I wanted wings William Holden one of my favorite all-time actors boy he was great he wrote great including a network which Josh Cortes didn't like but never less didn't like network no he didn't understand it well there's no problem as he's not mad as hell no the problem as he's never been in the broadcasting business he works here yeah that's what I mean if you're a man radio then you know then you really are a TV really appreciate that movie but he's been on the periphery on the bubble of it you know speaking of radio I was talking about what the saint was Cardinals are doing and you would know this deal the Cardinals are having a huge following throughout the Midwest because a camel X.15 thousand watt station and the Cardinals have like what he blanked giant fan base because of that is he being now they are going with a local state five thousand watt station that's been a fan a couple million dollars more a year and the Cardinals are buying fifty percent of the radio station that's going on a lot of the that's a good analogy there going on a horseball station for a little bit more money yeah and then winding up buying it and putting a minor league broadcast around here who isn't qualified to do anything but maybe a cure is syphilis well they're going to take the same broadcasters my channon and who else does the card in the lane they'll be doing broadcasts you don't bought doesn't do radio he does television i see so that's kind of unusual used to be that they would swing the the real teams with swing the TV guys back between radio and do that so much anymore well they should they don't do anything anymore like put good people on but i'm not very carry in bought prince when we need him i'll tell you i don't like that if that's going to be a precedent you know the idea that you working for the franchise you're not working for a station right so therefore i mean they're you know they because of the relationship they try to put restrictions on it but imagine if you had the answer to the marlins ownership for example oh here we go again listen you've only got until the end of the summer to get through the great read era from over here and so please i'm begging you we don't need the suspension number ninety we don't need to be peep out again mr. willberg i i told all the crap and you just you're i i told i'm told i'm told my friends and the broadcasts around the country that you've called me peep out there is terrible yeah i think i think i'm very quite a lot of the powder number eighty we don't have to take a powder pretty soon again if you don't cut the crap you know i usually get suspended on high school i'm going to i'm always been suspended yeah i i once got suspended because i had the sentence i was in you know we used to have to take a chorus class and the guy who taught the class was kind of the butt of everybody's jokes and a friend of mine and i worked out a thing where he we were on the third floor that's where the chorus class was yeah he went down and landed on a sidewalk so when the teacher came and i was standing by the window he went oh my gosh oh my gosh i hope he's not hurt and he came over and looked down and so the guy lying there on the you know on the sidewalk and you know he's calling whatever the equivalent of nine one one was at the time then yeah and anyway when the guy got up and so looking in the building so i got suspended the other guy didn't get suspended i did yeah i wouldn't be start with a marlins again for several reasons that's just the suspensions but uh they're they're toast speaking about other station they're toast oh yeah hana it's over i get back to arita i don't know what's wrong with you but i do know what's wrong there a bunch of crazy bastards but if you watch this thing i'm gonna be there i don't know if you've been looking at the thing and i've lowered the and the it's down to a three now is it oh no it's a five what are you talking about it before and told me it was a three he is so full of a man i got the latest advisory i've been watching it's a category five we can a little bit down to 170 but that's still well over uh it's category five and uh it's moving a little instead of do less now west north west and if you look at the if you watch it's spinning the upper the top quadrant there into the Louisiana he's got so much heavy duty reds and it's going to like barrel and Louisiana if anybody thinks those ladies are going to hold again they're dreaming and then all they keep talking about is corporate school and who's in which is fine is probably the highest probably going to go there but the heavy duty outer bands which uh they just can't sustain that that's a storm surge they can't handle it losing in a no way and they're not talking about that much catastrophic now interestingly enough uh speaking of suspensions the pole on taking the they might be of interest you of all the things that i talk about which is the least interesting to the audience okay things you talk about right and i got a list here of things that you know why don't you ask what the most interesting is i'll get to that we've done that okay this is negative don't you know where you are mister they like negative much better than positive south Florida man that's that's their message we hit everything

M. he she doesn't want to replay that nightmare especially now when it says tough going for a husband bushes under the worst pressure of his two terms in our office in his popularities near an all-time low the handling of the Katrina crisis and true pluses in Iraq a few old public discontent and pushed bush back to drink they pushed bush a Washington source says the sad fact is that he's been sneaking drinks for weeks now Laura may only have just caught him but the word is his drinking has been going on for a while in the capital he's been in a pressure cooker for a month the war in Iraq the loss of American lives has deeply affected him he takes every soldier's life personally and we believe that it affects him emotionally and has in drained the result is he's taking drinks here and there likely in private to cope and now with the worst domestic crisis in administration over Katrina you pray is making this a lot of control everybody get on your knees and pray okay another source said I'm only surprised to hear that he hadn't taken a shot sooner before Katrina he was in his wits and I've known him for years he's been a good old Texas boy forever he had a drinking problem for years that most professionals would say need a therapy he doesn't believe in therapy he never got it he drank his way through his youth through college and well into his 30s everyone around him is drinking another source says a family member told me they fear Georgia's falling apart the first lady's been assigned the job of gatekeeper bushes history of drinking dates back to his youth speaking of the this time as young man in the national guard he has said one thing I remember in the most proud of his my drinking and parting those with the days my friends those with the good old days to out of play that shouldn't we but that was an ended those were the days of my life I'll find out you know those were the days come on I can't think of her as ancient history was an apple record I believe and it's funny how six and nineteen seventy two he reportedly rounded off an ice-vosing with his 16 year old brother Marvin by challenging his father to a fight I didn't know yet a brother named Marvin yeah did you no I'll be there I know November first 2000 even his first presidential election Bush acknowledged that in 1976 he was arrested for DUI uh nearest current soul man man at age 30 but two demand Bush tweeted guilty and paid hundred fifty dollar fine his rather privileges were temporarily suspended in main he did a p-val I'm not proud of that Mary Hopkins that's what it's very good I just just don't know us talking he's right poppin on it okay that's enough I'm not proud of that he said I made some mistakes I occasionally drank too much and I did that night I learned my lesson and other interview around that time he said well I don't think I had an addiction you know it's hard for me to say I've had friends who were addicted very addicted they required having hitting bottom going to AA I don't think that was my case you said in other words he's in denial like most drugs uh Dr. Justin Frank a Washington DC psychiatrist author of Bush on the couch inside the mind of the president told the national inquire I do think that Bush is drinking again alcohols or are not in any program like the president have a hard time when stress gets to be great I think it's a concern that Bush disappears during times of stress he spends so much time on his ranch it's very frightened of the party and of course the president's got his itchy finger on and foot and right now you know that might divert our attention from Molly's catastrophes and an if to do all this chronism and brownie hounds and all this other stuff that's going on just punch that button baby and just a ranch one that might like to solve our problem where he's kneel Rodgers this is five 16 to eight it's I'm dying all the day. 1047 at 560 WGM still award on the Mo show. We're trying to like we're checking with all our sources to find out. Is it a go with Mo or whatever? Speaking of that bit I just played. We to could equal $5 gas. Some of us if you got a 16 gallon tank that would be like 80 bucks to fill up your tank. 80 bucks. You must be. How long used to be? 24.25 right? Fucking a half. Now we're talking 80 bucks. Thanks Mr. President. I realized that global warming has nothing to do with all this so we can't blame you. Remember when gas spiked to $3 a year after Hurricane Katrina says this story and see in in a money section? By this time next week, that could seem like the good old days. Three bucks a gallon. Good old days. Whether an energy expert say that his bad as hurricane Katrina Hintonations apply gasoline, read it could be worse. Katrina damage was focused on offshore oil platforms and ports now the greater risk is to oil refinery capacity, especially if Rita slimes into the Houston Galveston port Arthur Texas. We could be looking at gasoline lines and $4 gas maybe even $5. If this thing does the worst it could do to energy analyst P.W. Tel Aviv Cameron Hanover, this storm is in the wrong place and it's absolutely positively at the wrong time he said. Michael Schlachter, chief meteorologist at whether 2000 said Rita now if he is most likely in hit between port Arthur and Corpus Christian Texas, sometimes between the Marath Nune and Saturday morning. Just about all of Texas's refinery capacity lies in that at risk zone. There is no lucky 710 split scenario to use a bowling analogy. He said if he were fined within 200 miles, you're going to feel the effect. When Katrina hit 15 refinery, he's nearly all the Louisiana Mississippi with a combined capacity of about 3.3 million barrels a day were shut down or damaged. That represented almost 20% of US refinery capacity within a week almost 2.3 of that damage capacity to resume some operations. But for refinery, we're nearly 900,000 barrels a day of capacity are still basically shut down. If Rita hits Vothi, Houston Galveston area as well as the port Arthur Beaumont region near the Texas Louisiana border and that was to me like where it's going by the way. But not that I know anything but that was like where it's going. Alex like George where it's going. Josh is looking at because he's busy we watch a network. That could take out more than 3 million barrels of capacity a day according to Bob Tippy. Editor of the, one of his kin to a Tippy headrun. Editor of the industry, Craig Journal, oil and gas journal in Houston before Katrina system was already so tight that the worst case scenario is for the structure that took 250,000 barrels out of the picture a day that would have been considered a major jolt. He said, Tippy, we're already an uncharted territory now. We can't project what happens from another shot the size of Katrina or worse. Part of the problem is that skilled crews needed to make refinery repairs already as he tried to fix the Katrina damage. That would have been a temporary time for Marita. So then they could really rape you. Problems could spread beyond the gas pumps. Tippy said natural gas prices could see a further spike since so many of the offshore platforms all for Texas produce natural gas not crude oil. And while gasoline imports have helped bring gas prices down from recordized, there isn't as much potential for heating oil imports. Gansley intends to obscure everything especially since we aren't paying heating bills right now. Tippy said, but we're already looking at what a fuel problem we're about to take another hitable cause a lot of problems. You said, no, we're just going to stay or going to rape you man. Drop those checkered pants and get ready because they're going to rape you. They're going to take every dime. You're going to have to mortgage the house just to fill the tank. I get a bison. But I would do. I do like the Dutch to get a bike house to leave. Which is it now? I'm taking another one for the poll. I'm sure there must be some other ones things I talk about in the show that they couldn't hear less about the day. How about food? So I don't know if a lot about food. I'm sure if I if we did that whole week on food, which ourselves departmented a fabulous job following up on that. By the way, that's gone guys and you took Berkeley. You still need person. Food. You're going to put that on there? Yeah. Especially ice cream. I'm always talking about ice cream. I have no idea why. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pound 5 60 and the Verizon and singular wires. I would be like a heroin addict. I'll talk about heroin all the time. Or King Moss talking about blow. The rim of London, cosmetics firm said that it was reviewing its contract with model Kate Moss after newspaper photo showed her apparently snorting cocaine apparently. The statement came either that or she's just picking her nose. The statement came two days after the firm said it was time to continue its four year association with the model. Pictures recently published in the Daily Mirror newspaper in London, and heard the show they 31 year old Moss snorting cocaine Moss ignores last week the tablaid reports of a recent cocaine use word true. It's true baby. It's true. She's doing it. She's taken up the nose. British police also said they're investigating the allegations. We're more London is shocked in this made by the recent press allegations surrounding Moss's behavior. We're currently reviewing your contract company spokeswoman Caroline Pyecroft said. What if she's related to Caroline Beesley? Henness and Maritz, Europe's largest fashion retailer, earlier dropped Moss from upcoming ad campaign. Chanel said Wednesday would not review Moss's contract when expires October with said the decision was unrelated to drug allegations. Moss had been the face of Chanel's cocoa metamorphose up her few since 2000 in Duce. The fashion company Burberry also announced agreed with Moss to cancel plans for upcoming campaign. Burberry said it was said and by her current system size. Aren't you sad about it? Yeah. So, right. That's pretty cute. I am. Hello. Pretty good. Yeah. There's a shot. Carry would type to it. Okay. Especially. Listen. I got a suggestion for a poll. You might want to check it out. In general, what job or profession do you think is stealing their paycheck? Okay. You know what I'm saying? I don't know. When we've done all this kind of polls about different kinds of jobs, but we've never done that one. I don't want to pull about certain kind of jobs that we can't even talk about no more things to joys. It's a good time to read the monica, right? Okay. Thank you. Let's see. What kind of profession? Well, I'll find a way to work it. But that's pretty good idea. What is stealing? Stealing money. My politicians, for example. I know it would probably be near the top of my list. Just stealing your money, raping the public. WDQAM, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You're the shizl, my nizl. Yeah. Hey, listen. I'm over in the cannon. I can't stand these coolials down here. Okay. Good luck, you pal. It's not a fact that I have a story on that speaking of who he is about the no-piggeting lace. What else is that, sir? It's way down on my pod, pile. But thanks to him, I might have to move that up. I was from California, but you could change the wording from California to Florida and have the same result. Now, now he's going to make me look for it. I'm looking for it. I'll have to find it during the break. But it has to do with people offended by people speaking of pique and pomey. Not that there anybody in Florida offended by people who are not speaking of this. All of this is kind of a reverse story. It's called a bilingual message from his xenophobic, but soon they lay times. But I'll get to it. In time. You know what I'm saying? In time. I was in the blur with say. She was real head turner. I wonder if Josh liked that movie, the extra-sister. Yeah, it was fun. It was fine. It was not to look. Okay. Well, I mean, you just not all in enthusiastic about end movies that we love. I guess because they're all old and we're all old and crusty. And, you know, it's not like to be the great movies they're around today. Yeah, you get somewhere. Yeah. I can't take you by any, but there must be some. Come to QAM Hello. A poll on barbecue places in which newscasters would you like to see having sex? Yeah. And a barbecue joint. That's not bad. What about shorties in a candle? They built a metro rail just for shorties. Come to QAM Hello. QAM. Hey, how about a poll for suggestion about a poll? Come to QAM Hello. QAM Hello, Jack. QAM Hello. See, this is what we've done to them. This is, I love it. I feel like I made such a major achievement, you know, because by doing this, taking the old polls and having the, you know, not the entire list, there's always room for like a little bit more, but having generally the basic list and that we used before. Now it's like, now they're going to have to come up with some reason to call something to say. Not that that's going to happen, but now the pressure and that's why we're getting such a marginal analysis and response. Well, we're doing all of it for the poll, but you already got it on. Yes, right. Because that's boring. It's terminal. It is just, I'm sure the jica would rather hear that than hear me reading these ponders bedtime stories that are probably way above his bald head. But that's beside the point. We hate you, Tom. See, it wasn't just a, the one phony letter that he made up. And it wasn't the letter. It was the response. That's what kind of pork me up. And then it goes on with Mr. Ego there on a station. Nobody even knows what the call letters are on a program that nobody listens to. And just, you know, and it must have tremendous tune in audience because we got one facts about it yesterday. Yesterday, it just happened on Monday, allegedly. I have no way to prove that. And nobody else even verified it. Nobody even seconded that emotion. So, Iced going, Tom, you always were best on the station. Nobody's listened to. Especially when you started grifting. Look at that, 514 votes, and it's not even 11 o'clock yet. What do you think? I'm thinking like 25,000 votes today. This is Neil Roger's, what solid this is by 16, 18, two fell. Where does your learned this tray? You idiot. Whoever told you that you could work with men. What's your hired for? Just a help us. Does that seem clear to you to help us? To help men who are going out there, to try to earn a living. You company man, you fairy. You're the only one who's really going to get through to me.

And you know, since there are no calls on a board, that's because we got all the choices for the pool. We've taken away their thunder. Number two, please, about it. Last thing we need to know is for the Insta-Purron. Yeah, it's more thunder. Enough with that. We don't mind that chopper thunder from down under at the outback, for example. If we have a chopper thunder down under, anyway, don't say it because Joyce will get paid. 544 votes on a pool of all the things that Neil talks about, which is least interesting to you. Now, the Humper said, how about, do what's most interesting, what we have done that and we'll bring that back one these days. Not soon, maybe next week. Hockey, 149, enough with a hockey talk. Okay. Thanks, Rimmer, for nearly putting me out of business. You lunatic. You cheap skate. The track on all of that just so we can give them a free meal. I'd have been happy to send them a free meal. It was house ages to keep my of the studio and be to keep him off the air. And so we can just continue doing our show at IOD without having to do those. Oh, we need to do a hockey show. I'm in it with Kevin and bring Georgia Holist of all these people. Don, Sherry and Mr. That's what I'm hearing from you. And then a 1045, you got to go this high over here. And, uh, oh, brother. What kind of coffee you got going? Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'll take it black. The rimman, hey, Rimmer. Nice, no, and you stay the whole way. Don't call me anymore. I'm not sure if I'm not sure if I'm bothers me the most. Him or Joe Costello. All right, Joe. Of all the things that Neil talks about, which is least interesting to you, hockey, 149, will keep in mind nobody wants another Joe. The track 100, the racetrack. I haven't begging the Humper. I mean, I know he's a very big end of it. It's got to do with gambling and his horse and the horse and the whole day. He's good buddies with McZero. And he actually has just seen how he was a customer on the naked. I think. But that's it. Mo 54. Well, it's a good thing. You see how my timing is usually pretty good because it was getting really pondered where it's not when he just started a losing it and talking about punching the whole world in the face. I said, oh, boy, why even waste your time with somebody this. And we find out if he's under there or not, Josh? We haven't. Of course we haven't. Well, it's 11.05. Is he alive? Oh, boy. Mo 54. No, no, no, not too much about him. No, no, no. He just gets on my nerves. Gaze 52. Too much. Yeah, stop. Okay. Let's go. I don't think so. Diet talk 46. We're in hell to that come. I just started moving up there. Moving on up. A stock market 35, which I can't remember the last time a year ago, I talked about the stock market before I lost my ass. So why would I talk about that? Inside radio stuff, 29, those bedtime stories. Only 26. That's only 4.7% which means that of the people we still have listening. See, the people are offended by my reading the bedtime stories. Most of them are probably long gone already. Wouldn't you think? I would have had it. Yeah, they're gone. Like, Miguel, he's not listening to it. Show no mal. He's probably listening to, I don't know what else is on now. I don't know, a skier America. Or maybe he's listening to no spaghetti in glaze. That's more like it. We're right up in his alley. Probably listen to Radio 3 Habana. Bedtime stories 26 are a lot the least interest of. They can't handle. They can't stand it. They hate him. Politics 21. I'm stood M15. They are very much in Amsterdam. Especially, it was a shrooms man. They love those shrooms. I might have some shrooms for lunch today. Religion 11 health problems they had in food. We just put food on there. One. 551. This is a staggering. I look at there's the SCNM thing you show in the morning. Yes, today the day before. We're in the middle of the island. When increases our risk of surviving a lot better than not in the face of this. What do you want to see, Galveston? Yes, that's the premature evacuation. Did you see those upper bands again, whip and towards the right toward New Orleans, right side of the PC later in Louisiana? And it looked good to me. I mean, what do I know? I'm just a, uh, just a observer. What's all the line? Oh, my, meteorology. I ain't no mischamala or misnourcross. Gay. WQM. Hello. Out there. See, that line one just keeps doing the disconnect. Because I'll sneak a couple of calls in here as we get them, but they're pretty mean and mean because we've already got the pull put together. WQM, hello. Can I be on the show? No. Kill him by the way. Just kill him. He's a way or that's enough. Okay for today. I go take some pros at Ron. Get lost. Go break your kneecaps. Call up Kathy Bates. WQM. Hello. To a. I am. Oh, the two of us. I was around. Okay. Reverend Jones. Mike Whitney. It didn't astonishing. And it's just breathtaking view. There's just a radio show. This is a hobby. Have you ever thought to think about that? Order. This is not just a video. A lot of program. This is a hobby for a whole bunch of people out there. This is their life. This is their, I have no life. Hashtime. And I think it's long past time for somebody's people to be taken out. Call up Pat Robertson. See, if we can't do a Voodoo curse on somebody's people. When it does take them out for a long walk. WQM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Listen, Neil. I don't know if I just can get a few minutes to go. Has anyone mentioned the two-page spread in the Palm Beach Post this morning in the front section of the paper on one page. And they lied under pictures of the Rummy and W. And, uh, Cheney and Condy. And then on the other page was a list of every name of every guy who's died in Iraq. But that is said, they died. Have you, did you see that? No, I have not seen that because I don't look at the Palm Beach Post even on a dry day. Well, I thought I'd bring it up. There's a website. I'm sorry. I can't reflect the night of it. I don't have the paper with me. But it, it might be worth the while looking into. Okay. Thanks so much, Paulie. I'll check it out. I know we haven't had any calls on that because people were too busy saying, Bro, that's nice. That's like that. I'll check where we usually get the Palm Beach Post in the really in the break room. Yeah. We get the Palm Beach Post in the building. I mean, I could go online and look it up. But it would be a lot more fun if you actually had a right in your hand. Well, I'll see you during the next break. There's something. WQAM Hello QAM Slow line. Lifeless line. WQAM Hello. Hi. Yes, sir. I just think about a poll about how much George is five. Okay. WQAM Hello. Hey, that's okay. Meal. Speaking. Meal. You are the cause of why you show us the mice last three years. Oh, my gosh. It's the boy you show. Wait, don't listen to that. How come you're still listening, man, Jack. Ask. Yeah, he ain't listening. Now all of a sudden click on the reeds demise. And then we realize we were in demise. I thought we were kicking ass. We have those big juicy body numbers. Thanks a lot. That sounds boyfriend, by the way. WQAM Hello. Yes, sir. He throws out his board. K. He throws out his board. K. WQAM Hello. Hey, Neal. I see. But if I understand you're folk correctly, I'd like to nominate movies. Okay. Not interested in movies, huh? Neither home, man. I love you show, but the movie reviews have got to go. Okay. Moved. That's good. I didn't know there was a way like saying, well, we put food on everything. Most people aren't interested in food. Good food anyway, but put food on. There's one on movies. I mean, Jack says like movies, at least good ones anyway. That guy probably didn't like network. I should ask him that, Dammit. See, I should have like interjected today. Probably hated network like poison. So maybe you can call him back until you can like hook up and go over to a ball game together. Like a Marlon loss. I mean, a Marlon game. Of course, the Marlon's are playing at the midst of night after losing two embarrassing games side by each. You know, they had the basis load like that. Michael O'ell, man. Why did they dump his ass a long time ago? What? Nobody wants him. A hit a bomb left there. Hit a bomb? Yeah, hit a bomb right when they had the basis loaded in the top of the ninth and chance to blow that game open. I saw that. That's the only part of the whole game I saw was when he had the meds telecast on. Well, I can't stand that Fran Healy. What a delared. Wouldn't it be it? But isn't it Fran Healy on there? Is it, I think it is? Was Healy Ankeen? He's on the omets. Do you feel like Dave O'Brien? By the way, actually Dave is sounding pretty good on the SPN. I don't like Dave personally because he's screwed over. He's got a huge ego and he's screwed over to Angel Valley, which I like Joe a lot better, much better guy. Dave is okay, but he's got that same generic kind of sound. He's like 8,000 guys just sound like Dave O'Brien. He's pretty good. He's okay. But I thought it was ironic that they blew out your angel. John Henry and that crowd before the president to owners. They blew out your angel because Dave O'Brien wanted to be the main man. He wanted to be the whole of the big cheese and then come to fight out like five minutes after they did that and they changed your angel way of Brian says, oh well I changed my mind. I want to go to ESPN, you know? Well screw you Dave okay, they packed the misalami sandwich and set him on away, which is a good idea. Oh, I've said your one thing, they should have kept him as far as over this rich wall sky. I mean if you're asking me who do I like the better Dave O'Brien or Rich walls, is there any contest? Oh no. I mean, Dave O'Brien is like chat-hutley compared to Rich walls. Compared to that little boy, this again is on TV. Oh, now how many outs does it take to end the inning? He's not only he's bad and got a horrible voice and clueless and boring, but he doesn't even understand the game. That's what gets me. When you think part of the qualification for being a play by play broadcaster for immediately just sporting team would be understand rules of whatever game it is. Wouldn't that be good? Ah, that's what he hasn't got a clue. And of course you know, this Josh is again very quiet because he sees this guy and in fact, and I'm sure that Rich has probably sent him, you work on that show what has been. I guess that's bad mouth of me all the time. He probably says that. Actually, he never has no. I don't know that he knows. He doesn't know. Well, let's keep it that way. Of course, there are a ton right now. I'm going to make sure that no trouble makers will pass along the information that Josh is ripping Rich and A's on my show. Problem and it's after... Ha ha ha ha. Problem and it's nice to let. You see, it's really interesting. We take this poll today, which I think it's kind of interesting to see the stuff that Moore's ended up. And right away, it's like, oh, there's some kind of a problem here showing your response of that. And of course, they're still listening and just getting all hysterical. It really, I've tended to pain is so great. I don't know if I can survive till 2 o'clock. It just pains me tremendously. The pain that somebody's idiots want to inflict. You're a hive all your time. I would agree with that. I'm a terrible progato. I'm a real bastard. Hey, how did you sleep last night? The recent national survey by the National Sleep Foundation, fewer than half Americans, who are getting good and sleep most nights. One of the primary reasons of not getting good night's sleep is not having a comfortable supportive mattress. Like a brand new Simmons beauty rest queen said from a good friend's at dialo mattress.

This is Neil Rogers. This is 562-A-S. Bitch. I've to be out of your mind. You're about your death-long president. What do I keep? Good mind George. You've got to go me, oh my lord.

Won't disappear into that good night. America's beloved southern portacolla has been vanquished by neglect. Pumbled by the erosion of its wetlands and the weakening of its levees. Now, the tens of thousands of refugees are fleeing the previously thriving Metropolis, much like the people of Felugia, Tallah Farad Samara. In Iraq, the effects of hurricane, a George can be seen throughout the Sunni Heartland. Romskull continues to stirms or lacks underbelly like to come to Sherman on his march to the sea, leaving only 10 cities and desolation behind. The relief agencies are simply overwhelmed by a mindset of the human catastrophe. There's no way they'll be able to meet the people's needs. Worship course just shrugs off such sentimentality. What possible difference could their suffering make? Besides, there's no longer even a trace of plan for Iraq, just the faintest abuse of the course and the drug inhalation in slaughter. None of it makes any sense nor should it. The nation is sinking in an ocean of hubris and delusion. Reason in decency vanished in the desert, Morocco. Only the wrath of your utter destruction persists. There's no stopping this juggernaut. The Washington's ruling elite are held back to continue. Flailing away at every obstacle in their murderous path. This week is Iraq. Next week, it's Syria. What possible difference could it make? America won't be digging out of this or G. Of, tear anyway. Boshes led us to the brink. The economy is teetering our alliances are crumbling in the nation's Ambling toward disaster. All the wild and dear leaders fixed his vision on the deepest part of the Quick Sand and Trejas onward. America won't dodge the reaper this time. Character is fate. Our future is hopelessly shackled in the dwindling forces of our Vacuous president, George Walker Boyd. All the conces. I didn't like that. A little depressing. Yeah. For those of you folks still in America. I mean, you know what I'm saying? 627 votes. Are you impressed or what? Are you blown away? Well, not as much as some people will be. Why? Why do you mean by that? Or the hurt. Like Tom Jick and Miguel. No, I mean the people are Louisiana. Oh, that's bad. No, but seriously, how come we can see that we were talking about it before the Show this morning? Yeah. But it was a turn your TV on and there it is. I mean, we don't see Bob Franken in his stupid old ass. There's the thing in the bottom right hand corner and watch it. See. And even in rap report, who's like a 10 week old bottle of milk. I mean, even he said, well, this is what we have removed the target a little bit to the east. Yeah, right. Yeah, to the right. Exactly. Just like America's moving to the right as far as they can go to the right. And there's those. In fact, if I just look at the radar and there's some pretty heavy doody stuff here. And there's a lot of people who are going to be in the next 40 years. They're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. And they're going to be in the next 40 years. They're going to be in the next 40 years. They're all going to be in the next 40 years. You see how that all ties together. They're going to be in the next 40 years. I mean, I kid was so wide open in the end zone. I've done a push into hurricanes. What lose of quarter. Am I? Am I? Yeah, Brian. Car strikes pedestrians on the lost Vegas strip. Oh, well, yeah, this reminds me. I want to talk to Hank about this. But we had important fish to fry about Hank in suspended for the eight hundred times. yesterday killing one injury 13 authorities said police erected the driver at the scene it reminded me of that talk to the waitress remember that story a few years ago and that many years and she won the megabucks for like 26 or 30 million some like that I think was more like a turn to me one million and the next day she gets wiped out on drabner car going to work she gets wiped out on a road by a drunkard driver not she's in a wheelchair she's a a fair plegette remember that story i do you went 31 million bucks in some drug and peace of crap comes along and destroys your life man the car jumped the curb about five fifteen yesterday afternoon roving people walking from the valleys in perisotino hotel casinos a fifty two year old man was pronounced that a university medical center eight other people all adults being treated at hospital and it's got an actually picture well website is this must be uh... it's a peep people laying there in a street being attended to buy uh... medical personnel is just amazing five people were taken take into sunrise hospital that's in the Vegas not in the sunrise where one man was in critical in the kitchen to others listed as serious after striking the pedestrians the burgundy view a question to a wall came to stop in a landscape area in front of valleys the car's driver steven rest of twenty seven of reauto california was arrested to see by an off duty officer who was at nearby restaurant it wasn't therapy was injured and results of the drug and alcohol tester pending police folks in hozaman toy said authorities were investigating where the car with california license plates was stolen rest of his being held in jail we have a rule out whether this was an intentional on intentional act like that when that farmer thirty three of woodstock jodier walk by the scene after seeing the chaos more hotel room at the Paris we didn't hear the crash he said we saw people lying on the sidewalk farmers has been and he said the couple had been down the same stretch of the strip upon our before the crash the speed on this road is just too fast in farmer a police officer can't judge it always driver real fast on the strip about like two miles an hour because it's so congested and look at the freaking time were you as a meal And when come from property, this way we get dark on my knee, all day died in the easy and up I rest after the tea no tea. Old country not don't put no blame on me, but they come from my vacation for a photo of opportunity. Swing your partner round and round, now build those summons in the war of the stout and swim to the left to the right, here we go. Sight a little munch out, those who don't. Old country not like in those people, please. It's a course of the easy and up and it's for a tear-wacky. That's a looping. 25 to 25 to noon, we still haven't found out what the deal is whether Moe is doing the show. He's on from New York again. From New York again. That's right. Moe from New York. In fact, maybe he's taking a page out of my book now. And he'll from Toronto, more from New York, Mad Dog from Tank from Vegas, Mad Dog from Michigan. Huh? Sounds like it's got a possibility to me. By the way, they got a call to the movies for the poor get-a-life. It's just amazing to me. I'll make no difference because it fits in with self-ported perfectly. The mouth-contents no matter what you're talking about. We don't want that. Mad, we don't want it. Whenever you're talking about, we are like, man. What do you want? I don't know, but you're all listen. That is it. That you put your big fat thumb right on it. What do you want? It's like these people are quoted. How come you keep talking about this? Okay, well, what do you want to talk about? I don't know. Anything but that. Yeah. Go over with the tape and stuff. It's like little kids. You know, they know what they know they don't want for dinner, whatever you're serving, but they haven't got any of the foggyest idea what they do want. And it's the same thing. We don't want it. We don't like it. F***! Well, you know what? Get lost. Take a hike. Take a radio and stick it inside your breath. Thumb, right? Especially the car radio. That's always fun. Just take the whole car in there. 665 votes. I think we better call our friends at the Guinness Booker Records because we are going to go over 700 by Nuna. Are we? What is the weather bridge? As you mentioned, covering up much of the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. Look at the side and everywhere. Look at the color change here on the storm. There's a few fields, a purple there. And now we're not seeing much of the purple. So we're in the middle of what we call that eye-war place in the cycle of the storms. We can just do some little bed. It's still a category five. It doesn't get worse than that. There's 165 mile per hour. How do you say? And we'll probably see some continued weakening over the next day. I prefer to say a category five. That's a category three, four or five at the time that it makes landfall. Either way, that's still a major storm. And doesn't make a lot of difference between the winds that they are now. What they were earlier today. Four cast track is moving west and west. We want to get that kind of camel out again. Galveston. We're drinking with your friends. A mile per hour. But we still think that since it's taken a little bit of a jog on up to the north, our estimated landfall time is still going to be early in the morning. We think on Saturday, the Fertiated Path of Skinny Line. Right through Texas, right to Crawford. Where does Crawford have any idea what part of Texas Crawford's in? Do you know? No, I don't. Well, do Google on there. Somebody and look up Texas map and see if you can find. I mean, I don't know. Never really cross my mind. Nor doesn't make much difference. But where does this Crawford Texas? And maybe that hurricane is right on the line. Maybe there's a message from God. Oh God. Woman convicted in excesses in death in Georgetown, Guyana. A keyonogery is convicted of women of manslaughter for killing your friend during an exorcism right at ritual. Thank God, at least Josh liked that movie. And let me say again, the guy doesn't like talking about movies. You need help. You know how to once in a while, go to see your Schluck bus to do something. Do you know anybody who doesn't like movies? No, I don't. In fact, look, although it does have four votes now. Food has got only a pair and movies has got four. I don't just under $765 vote. How could you not like movies? I mean, even if you don't like current movies, you can always talk about old movies. We've talked about every kind of movies all the way back into the 1800s before they invented them. What? It's just, it's different. Why do I get myself work out of such crap? Well, speak on a crap. XF the I agent and crashed the night early release. You all remember this guy. I think just three weeks into the 90s sentence for drunken and reckless driving, driving former F the I agent David Ferrell yesterday asked the judge you sentenced him to 20 jails early. And the judge said, oh, forget about it. Ferrell 42 of co-conocrete was convicted on charges standing for me November 1990 on collision. It killed two lotterhill brothers. And then, of course, you recall the whole deal where they tried to blame them. His attorney, John Howard's argued for an early release by telling Broward Circuit Judge Mark Gold at Ferrell has lived an exemplary life. Is that Ferrell or Ferrell? But gold ordered Ferrell back to jail for their main service three month term. Gold questioned whether Ferrell's motion for a mitigated sentence was filed on time. Even if a was gold said he'd still rule against the request. Ferrell had been accused of crossing the fatal crash by grabbing the wrong way on I-95 and pop at a beach. A jury in 2002 acquitted Ferrell or felony manslaughter in vehicular homicide charges in the deaths of a race Williams 23 and Craig Chambers 19, jurist on Ferrell guilty of six Mr. Meiner charges. Ferrell served one day in January 2003 before he was released on $10,000 bond while the appeal is conviction. Even Eve on the passion has got a better chance to get out early. After losing appeals he began his 90s sentence on the DUI, reckless driving conviction to member one. Ferrell's attorney noted that his client upheld all conditions of her is really stirring appeals. The former FBI agent worked on civil volunteer project, how it said. But assistance stated attorney Michael Horowitz pointed to a Ferrell's post-conviction driving record as reason to keep him in jail. Ferrell received a speeding ticket in South Carolina, April 2002, a citation for her failing to evade traffic sign in Virginia in October 2004, Horowitz said he was found guilty in both incidents. The prosecutor also argued that following conditions of release and performing service tonight, just as I alluded to, he said. We're all a few. Of course, they were here. I'd have to use these days. All the hysteria and rightfully so after the jury said, oh, well, you know, South Monteress. And that's what they did because that's the American FNWA. Must have been those of black guys. They must have been responsible. A lot of them are because races do understand nothing like that. Six hundred and eighty-one votes. I've had to even Josh who's very difficult to impress. He's a hard ass. I've had to even he is shocked by this turn of developments. Aren't you? I've never seen him say he said I'm amazed. What he said. He's amazed that I like to move me network. He's amazed that I don't like to move me. I love it. I've asked him probably twenty times. Maybe even more than that. Maybe I've heard the man. That's how good it is. And even George would agree. I've actually anybody else would like you larger than the thumbwood too. This is New Rogers.

And then, at any cave for the baseball game, Marlon's at the Metz. Now, the amazing part of it is sometimes I just, I just knock myself out with how amazing an astonishing man. I'm serious about that. My psychic powers are just beyond belief. I do not tell you that this hurricane, we did a god he had batting in the first time. If you're okay right, the first time to win again, he's the one that said that, and then the right, the good book, the bad book. And if you look at the map, and now did you look at this before you were fasted? Of course I did. I marked it. I wrote, I wrote on the way. Of Houston. And in fact, Crawford is so small, it's very hard to find in any map, but it's right. As is right by, uh, wacko's, uh, wacko's. Right by that wacko. And it's going to go inland, and it's, it had right for Crawford, just like I said, the Lord is peo at a George W. Bush, and it's all bunch of Nazi. This is the way you do it. The rest of the country, they're just in back on the rest of the Democrats there, but it would put about there's like three or four of them would balls like Ted Kennedy and Diane Feinstein and Diane of Christensen. I'll get back to you, Diana. I'm going to have to watch it again just in honor of Josh and not like anything. If you don't like it, you don't like it. That's okay. Some speak with people who are like spinach. I don't. Doesn't like broccoli. I love broccoli. Or is that spinach for that man? Or spinach for lunch, for lunch, for lunch, for a lot of flour, especially y'all, grottin. Anything, almost anything which he's on. Well, moving along.

Congratulations to the Crawford Football team on Yadi Adi Adi. They did this. They did that. Be sure we decrofer news. Our cover says. You'll love this. Just hang on tight. President George W. Bush and his wonderful wife Laura. Purchased her ranch just outside Crawford, 1999. George and Laura recognize the beauty of the area. And what a great place we have here. Please come by and see us sometime. Rita. We'll be adding several links to help you become better acquainted with where we are. The wonderful area we live in in the best ways to get here. And of course, you didn't say what we are because we're already a bank. Much of Yahoo Red Max. Much of Droll and Idiots. Wow. I'm impressed. Here's the fact that says you mentioned Rickshaw to begin your program. We didn't finish the story. We're going to tell. I didn't have any story about Rickshaw. I just told him to rip our head because I had the jingle. That's all. What about any story? Well, what is with these people anyway? How was it? Don't they get it? Come on. This is not a story about Rickshaw. His calf. If he knows the story, it's just that he was born with it on the Yes. He speaks with the guys. Good guy. Richard. He's the longest as far as I know. He's over 40 years on the year in Miami. He's got 10 years on me. Of course, he probably is about 75. But nevertheless, we like Rick a lot. He's called his show many times. The only thing that mugged him one time was that shock radio got him a little bit. I am not a Nazi. I never forget today. I think it was my 25th anniversary on the year. And he called and he said, you do great radio. I almost hit here came to my eyes. It was just, you know, because you ordinarily, if you're like not the pedestrian usual crap, you know. All you do is get crap. You know, the media, they dump on you. And it just rip you and ask. And they take the chief shots. Which is fine. I could get a crap. Plus about that unless it's a pun. Some of you are supposed to be your friend like Tom Jitter. You're not full of me, little Tommy. You always hated this show. You're always second guessing. You kind of remind me like Norma Kent, only Norma's a good guy. Good girl. But you just wanted to be. You just another frustrated broadcast. So that's why you keep playing radio. That's why you're filling with your body. We might do that. We didn't do that ever. I don't think we did. Maybe we did. Maybe we didn't. And you know what to bet? Because I got all the music. As long as I went out and spent all my money. Might as well do something constructive with it. But you'll see if you put that on the floor. Or G is so great too, man. You mean, if you was going to allow for, you would great. But anyway, now you're talking about two things that hate music and movies standing in the shadows of Motown. So anyway, he goes on to say, P.S. I used to hate boomer assassin until he started badmouthing Moe. I hate Moe and the proof that I would offer to buy him a meal at the Algarden. Boomer assassin has been badmouthing Moe. Do we know about that? We don't know if he's going to do that. Wow. Well, let's Google it. Let's talk to the powers that be. Let's find out that sounds like a scandalous story in the making. Anyway, getting back to Rita, if you look at where this thing is supposed to be going right as to Houston and at least a part of it anyway. Maybe not the eye, eye, eye, eye, eye. But the eye. And right on, it's right due toward Waco and Crawford. The Lord is just jamming it. It's just right on course. See, that's the first one. He missed a little bit. You know, it's like lobbing the hand grenades. Sometimes they land where you're specter hope. And sometimes they don't see lobbing other ones. Right? But it's wrong to the balls. Sometimes you have to teach her in a hidden. Sometimes you miss. Sometimes he had Judy in the first row instead of the back of the head. Wow. 7122 votes. Are you shimitting me? The levies they're saying. Basically at this point, one of the guys said it's really like looking at the crystal ball Darren in terms of what could happen here that really got away to see which direction read ahead and what she ends up doing to the area of New Orleans. Darren. That was, was, was that a reporter? What, huh? Was that a report, Darren? Who now was that muddacon? Man. That was pathetic. It's really a couple of five for kissing an India. We've got to take some calls. WQAM. Hey. What's up, then, Pally? How you doing, sir? Um, if it's possible. Yeah. I like to read a class beyond the B. The Curtains. Yeah. Oh, wow. Then we would go to jail if we did that. We'd all go to jail. She, she hit, and it's got to be a joke. Yeah. Every time I see her, I think, is this got to be a comedy act? Isn't it? I think pulling a fast one on us. You people at MSNBC, man. You are the worst. You're crazy. See, they put that thing on the air. The NBC never put that on there to compete with CNN and Fox. In fact, I think they were on before Fox. I'm not really sure Fox News. And they don't know what they want to be. They haven't figured out what they want to be when they grow up yet. And so they've tried everything. They tried field Donahue. And they tried Linda, L.R.B. with the big glasses. And they tried everybody's Chris Matthews in 10 different times. Lots, you know, talking out of the side of his mouth. And now they've reached just when you think that they reached an all-time low by putting that bow tied Simphering idiot mother and Tucker Carlson on there. They finally jammed his back to 11 o'clock at night. So they could put on weed or cause be there. They're big, cool from the Fox News network. And of course Fox didn't want her anyway. Didn't we knew her contract? Because somebody finally actually saw her on here and said, Are you kidding me with L.R.B. What is it? Is it animal vegetable or a mineral or a mineral? And of course. Oh, that's just cause. I mean, you listen to the voice. The first time I saw her, I thought, okay, she's got to learn. And she's got a cold. You know, she just had bad climbing. And she can't speak. So she looks like a pig with a bad nose. She's a cow. And on top of that, she can't speak. Other netty is dynamite. This is Neil Roger. This is 5.62. This is Mark Morgan. Is the 12-1 hour on Q8.

Absolutely So much for Santa Monica being ground zero for tolerance and progressive is a rights Andres Originally at a whole foods market It's also partially a beacon of touchy feedliness Women accused my son Sebastian's babysitter for speaking to him in Spanish Oh, great Sebastian all of 11 months old was buying some fruit bearing offered for tasting So Ursula and Stem Canis Probar That's when this perfect stranger let's call her Mizzenifold Swipped into it part her hateful ignorance You shouldn't speak Spanish to that child She said I'm sure that's not what the parents want Canis Probar How about Beckham? Oh stop She is sure is she such breathtaking impudence If only I'd been there to give them a piece of my mind Says I'm place It isn't just that the father of this blonde child happens to be a blonde half Mexican Or my sister's fishing that knows he missed xenophobic I'm not reminded so much if Ursula had been speaking to Sebastian and Swedish or German What's most is heartening about the incident How mainstream this woman views our about the undesirable American kids learning a foreign language This isn't a play for immigrants to go about their business exclusive They're in the native language I'm not somebody who believes they can be a full member of the American community without speaking English Let me say it again You can't be a full member of the American community without speaking English Which is why I have crumbs about open-ended bilingual education says on-grace I wonder if on-grace is related to on-grace candor But if it's important for immigrants to learn English order with similar and worse societies Equally important for all Americans regardless of their ethnicity To be exposed to foreign languages in order with similar in the broader world And if people like Mizzenifold think a blonde child's command of English Will naturally suffer if he's exposed to a second language The underestimate the next 30 of a child's mind in human intelligence I was raised on-grace said speaking both English and Spanish And I sound like what I am a native speaker of both This is no reflection of my abilities It's a matter of when I was exposed to languages It wasn't until I studied French and Russian later on that I realized what a gift it was To have been exposed to two languages in such an early age Go to a country such as the needle-ons and you encounter an entire population that seems bilingual If I'm not trialing, it's rather humbling All speaking in English in needle-ons Unless there would be a number of hundreds As a matter of fact the people in business there they speak all much languages It's kind of a shocking But anyway such as the distance before languages in this country many second generation Americans feel compelled to drop their ancestral language When I first came to the US as a student I was stunned to discover that some of my Mexican American classmates spoke to a Spanish In some cases presumably because of a defensiveness beaten into them by societal pressures They seem to resent my expectation that they would Just like George who's Spanish is really lame and he admits it How about taking a refresher course? Nothing Go to a temperpans of the good Within the US only Utah seems to sufficiently appreciate the need to encourage multi-lingualism among native board kids And that has something to do with the Mormon churches need for missionaries They like that missionary position in Utah Utah starts kids in a second language early makes them stick with it Many American schools start just about the time the kids lose their ability to ever lose their pick them up Still it's a good thing that they elied unify district recently moved to stiff and high school foreign language requirements Not so good as they politically correct trend at some colleges to consider sign language a foreign language Ah, no Miss Missy in the clubs reaction to Ursula speaking to Sebastian in Spanish is almost comical given his heritage Instead of being outraged she should have been particularly pleased as he's someone she believed not to be Latino learning Spanish The notion that it's somehow unpaid for you out of to encourage blind toddlers in Santa Monica to speak a second language It's not only a narrow-minded and provincial it is itself unpatriotic the United States not unlike the Mormon church As a strategic need for multilingual citizens the nations need is a matter of economic competitiveness and national security We understand this is a society in moments of crisis after the Soviet-Slawn Sputniks say or when Washington realized that had a shortage of Arabic translate Isn't the aftermath of 911 but we do a little about a day in and day out my last message to Missy in a fob if the sound of foreign languages and culture diversity makes you so twitchy Maybe California is not the place for you and having you noticed that your city's name is in Spanish Oh How do you like that What do you say when you're actually asking I thought it was rhetorical oh, it's yeah, you're right. It's works here everywhere I wish I could you know speak Spanish with the kids, but I don't you better not you better not Mr. cuz then all those good old boys have turned on your ass I'll give buddies out there to swing clubs man are gonna turn on your ass I'm looking at that story You should be ethnic breakdown of Miami velvet just the name one of them.

He needs to depends. You can't believe it And you want to know what inspired them what your great critique on the movie network in the end of school converted to swingers club Muncie in the Anna oh, man, maybe you go up there and check it out but don't Residents of a southwest Muncie neighborhood thought 110 year old former school with purple doors have been vacant these past 14 months So neighbors were surprised to find out that the building which was last used in the vingo hall is home to one of indiannes seven swinger clubs They're swinging it. I thought it was empty to tell you the truth Mary Neel who rents a house across the club told us to our press That shocks me. I'm just floored there are a lot of kids that walk around here Swinging involves having social and sexual intercourse with someone other than a spouse book and a girlfriend of primarily involves couples Oh, this is story from the Boston globe And you know everything's been banned in Boston those Puritans are still hanging around. Definitely explain it Locally legislators are probably to shut down the 1700 square foot club laden Ah Sank will bring crime into the community and neighbors in city officials are debating whether the residential area is the platform all-cation for a private club Marda Monty and under she's painted John Lody from a nasal park Maertor Mutey director, the city county town commissions said club laden could violate zoning rules for a A woman who identified herself as manager refused to give her name called a and peed that the club and its members were discreet and had received no complaints from neighbors.

Club laden is open Friday and Saturday nights and advises members to bring their own alcohol and contraception to cover by cheats, bathrooms and locker rooms. An annual membership cost 25 bucks for couples in single men and 20 bucks for single women. Members must have been not so bad enough if I others are their students' exactor club without permission. That's why I was a bad idea when the class of I was taking Bob Green was swing club. I was, what was the one that started talking about? I was trying to like to envision that in my mind. I just somehow, I don't know. Because I really don't think Bob ever really had a f***. I could be wrong about that. I don't think he's going. Well, no contact. Oh actually you saw it huh?

The yearliner circled Southern California for hours, crippled by a faulty landing. You're well inside its cabin. 140 passengers watched their own life and death drum on folding on live TV. While satellite TV sets aboard JetBlue Flight 292 were turned to news broadcast, some passengers cried. Others tried to telephone relatives and one woman said a text message to her mother and Florida, Tim McCumber, and the event she died. That was the Lisa Schiff who sent a text message to her mother and Miami. It was very weird it would have been so much com or without the television's P. of armor of L.A. said after the plane skated with safe landing last night. The steam was sparks and burning tires. Nobody would hurt. It was an accident but nobody got hurt. The varm of 23 and other passenger said the plane's monitor is carried live. Direct TV broadcast on the plane's problems until just a few minutes before landing at L.A. X. The landing your travel, the front wheels were stuck in the sideways. Physician was discovered almost immediately after the plane departed by the home airport in Burbank at 317. I moved to New York. The air bus between 20 surf from the lawn and beach airport about 30 miles. Stop turning me! South of Burbank, before being cleared to land at L.A. It stayed in flight for three hours to burn off. Fuel said F.A. spokesman Don Walker. Zachary Mascoun of New York said it was surreal to watch his plane's faping discussed on live TV while it was in the air. At one point he said he tried to call his family with a cell phone call when go through. I wonder how my dad and tell him I'm alive so far. The 27 year old musician said. The pilot finally brought the plane down. Back wheels first. As he slowly left, I would hope back wheels first when you. Yeah. As he slowly lowered the nose gear, the stuck wheels erupted in smoke and flames which quickly burned out. I'm trying to think of a landing where you have the... Well, what any? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I've had some bad landings, but never the nose gear going down first. But nevertheless, at the end it was the worst because you didn't know if it was going to work if it would catch fire was very scary. Grown men were crying so Diana Hamilton 32 a TV graphics specialist. As the plane was about to touch ground Hamilton said crewman was ordered people to assume a crash position, putting their heads between their knees. They're all knees that is. They would yell, brace, brace, brace, you said. I thought this would be it. Emergency crews from across the air met the plan on the runway. We expect hiters gathered on buildings instead of parked cars to see firsthand his passengers walked on a stairway out of the tarmac with their carry on luggage. Some passenger shook hands with emergency workers and weaved the cameras. One fire fired a carrying a boy across the tarmac, put his helmet to the child's chest. We all cheered I was bawling I cried so much so Christine Lund 25 was traveling with her cat. George cries a lot too because he hasn't been bawling so much. But anyway, it's as facts from Edinburgh, Lauderdale, more panty fun it says. Man accused of hanging panties on cars at park. And by the way, I did the print out that bush thanks for reminding me about printing out the bush or the bruises of crisis again. Yeah, so I can read it again in the last hour. Not that I want to pile on. Oh, yes I do. Yes, I do. A Wisconsin man upset with the Warsaw Parks Department's fund on usual way to retaliate in Warsaw, Wisconsin. Police said the man repeatedly hung women's underwear on department vehicles while they were parked for the night. They said he struck 30 to 50 times saying, Bras and panties are very assizes on cars. Police said he admitted doing it after being caught on videotape. He told investigators he was upset with the parks department because an employed cutting grass at a park would blow grass on a while. He said an A gazebo. Police referred the case to the DA's office recommended he be charged with. This is what it's called. Enough of the blow and already if there was constant, okay? Critics, speaking of that, predict Katrina Whitewash. Oh, you feel believe that. It must be a little bit less than that. Left wing spin mice to propaganda. US President George W. Bush's appointment in his own home and security device. He had a White House investigation of what went wrong with the government's Katrina response and how to fix it. He's being greeted with some skepticism by emergency preparedness and response experts. What a shock. These authorities, many of whom spoke to IPS on condition of end of that's interpreservation or is on condition of end of the nmd. Pulling out that the president's advisor Francis Townsend has little experience in emergency preparedness and response. She's a former prosecutor's recent background is interrismulated intelligence. They also expressed stuff that anybody in the executive branch of government, corporate is an objective assessment of itself. It's kind of like the fox investigating the chicken coop. The idea that anyone in White House, my producer report that inverses the president or holds people accountable is just naive. One source told IPS. Dr. Jack Burman, a former asses in Secretary of Commerce and interview that the only self-incriminating investigation that's considered valid as a plea of guilty as charged, since that will not be said, consuming the Katrina debacle, the proposed process becomes a white wash, released a light gray wash, and will not be seen as credible. It is a waste of time and money when attention should be paid how to rectify such in components which requires an independent assessment permit be seen. But towns that a Republican who's gained a reputation as a tough-by-to-care official might just compound or critics. We doubt it, but she might. She currently shares the Homeland Security Council reports to the president or Homeland Security policy and matters relating to combating terrorism. She came from the White House to the White House in the US Coast Guard, where she served as an assistant commander, Tom and Doug for Intos. It goes out about Brownie Brown and Bobby Brown. I think we'd like Bobby Brown, Lepard and Brownie Brown. No question. And spite of that stendol. Yeah, speaking to Brown, all these studies, where there's a money coming, who are these people that waste their tendur, all these studies? Men are dirtier than women. So scientists can firm by spying in public restrooms, watching as a quartermen left without washing their hands. The worst offenders were in Atlanta Braves baseball game. Well, I'd say here is, in contrast, 90% of the women did wash up. Wednesday's results marked the American Society of Microbiology's latest look at how many people take what's considered a single easiest step to sting healthy, spending 20 seconds rubbing with soap out of the faucet, under the furer faucet. Let me say it again, when you go into take a one, I say, in Uno, others, if you're going to wash it all wash first before you touch your goods. Those of you who come out who washed after taking Uno, there's something wrong with that. Unless you got a real dirty shit, say, you don't agree with that, dear. I, we had the discussion. Many times, I just always stand there. Of course, if you do the old doze, well, it explains that's a George's language, or an ace doze trace. What do you do after you do a trace? A quiet. It also explains why these infection experts tend to use paper towels to open bathroom doors. There's no telling what germs are the person before you left on the knob. Oh, we sent the seat. What kind of germs are on your knob? Especially at the bath house. Oh, God. It's a gamble said, microbiome is a duty daily of primary children's medical syndrome in Salt Lake City. Back in 1960, society first had an out-of-and-people follow moms advice to always wash up after using the turlet. Researchers, language and public restrooms. Oh, yeah, researchers, my ass. Putting on makeup or combing their hair while served, statistically counting, they concluded that about third of people did not wash. Let me tell you about those people who hang around in public restrooms. This is real rubbish. This is 5.16. Not just the one to two hour, it's a phenomenon. I'm curious about one thing. When Grandpa Moore was doing these shows from New York, do we have any idea where he's broadcasting from? No idea. Well, let's find out. Let's get the put-on in the agenda for tomorrow. I'll do that. 931 votes and we still got an hour to go. What is this really shocking? What's going on with these polls? Who says we go to good poll? This just in the Senate Judiciary Committee, endorsed John Roberts to be chief justice of the U.S. today? What a surprise. With three Democrats during majority Republicans in the United nomination of full Senate for confirmation. They said they really enjoyed his performance filling in now and then on the CBS-EV news. The Committee voted 13 to 5 in favor of making the Conservative Judжination 17 Chief Justice. Senators heard cool and rust fine gold over Wisconsin during the committee's ranking. Democrats Patrick Leah Vermont and crossing party lines to support Roberts. Explaining his support, Coles and Roberts made a clear to him that he'll be a modest judge, not a activist and will approach arguments with an open mind. This is not an easy decision, but I think it's the correct one added fine gold. Democrats dying fine-stine not to be confused with fine gold or fine steam or fine bird or fine fine fine fine Joe Biden had Kennedy texture or and Dick Durbin voted against Roberts they voted the old fine sign of California told a packed in a sheer committee hearing room that a vote was decided after Roberts refused to fully answer questions for her other Democrats in this confirmation hearing last week. I know as little about what George Roberts really thought about issues after the hearing decided before the hearing this makes it very hard for me said fine sign and abortion rights supporter. I cannot in good conscience can't say yay votes he said I will can't say law about Biden who's just Biden is time Democrat a Delaware city made a mistake in voting to confirm Justice Antonin Scalia who will vote an answering question of this confirmation hearing and won't vote for Roberts either all the committees tend Republicans voted to confirm the nominee what a surprise would send her or in hatch calling him the best nominees ever seen I can tell he's as good as it gets had said and here my hearing probably would agree I'll say 17 foot see wall likely to be tied to which remorning for that. All right David Madeline there by the 17 foot see wall in Galveston when he was second with you David me while we want to take you straight to a news conference is happening right now the governor whether it's governor or a bomb like him. That's a by chance must evacuate and you should be leaving now. Off a lot of evacuated we go and on down there you know and a lot of it in the water and play that sound effect. Okay. Yeah we can't get Joyce for that one yet yet nine hundred and thirty nine votes on the poll aspect tech at a reason where we spawns I think I we hit the mother load as Diana Parkinson said and network I'm sure Josh was sleeping to that part. Yeah right about there are the young that Atlanta and she throws the phone up here I think was she struck the mother load she was she was so good fade down away nine hundred and forty vote you like fade that away I did yeah but Josh is such a fade down away phase that her mounted on the fireplace. Oh picture. Taki 255 the track hundreds of all the things Neil talks about the least interesting view hockey 255 forget about hockey okay we loved up to the tanks but don't talk about them. The track 176 gased up ninety no more no more this factory okay I'm Mr. Macho from this day forward okay I'm gonna butcher up instead of fade away and I'm gonna be more like a Marion Wayne.

Diet talk 79 no more diets let's just eat get fat and die okay. Oh I never got to put on my bra worse don't let me forget about according to two stick it on there on my flavor wave. The stock market 56 as in how many dollars you got left after your investment 56 bucks just like 256 inside radio stuff only 42 see the lower these numbers get that means it's the more interest to they are. You following that right? Those bedtime stories only 40 that's 4.2 percent. It's the same 4 percent all the way through. Oh wait hey you know the time jick or crap. Well turn out something else get lost because it's not gonna stop I'm gonna continue I'm gonna continue doing what I like doing I'm doing the arrogate show and if anybody I'll don't like it hey see that's always been my attitude is opposed to you know I'm taking this poll because it's a poll because we got it not because I'm looking through all I like I said the top two or three there obviously I'm not a fool not a total fool. Well politics look how many politics got only 30 30 votes they want to hear it they want to hear that bush bashing they want to hear the truth they want to hear it's it in fact I got Bob Herbert voters we more so I'm bush I got that here in a second. I got the gate couples protests well we better not read that one it's got a story that I'd have to bury that one. Amsterdam only 25 and religion 25 how about religion Amsterdam always churches one thing about Europe man they got it was big massive churches there every city's got a dome a duomo a dome a deliways health problems 14 music only 12 solument they don't say very good oh you're gonna get that lady upset that's uh Zee Bob movies a season California with Arnold and food only six so music movies and food that's the show there it is and maybe wants a wild religion Amsterdam praying uh getting on your knees and hamster and praying or whatever nine hundred and fifty votes I am so I just came beginning to describe it like human hungry with them please this punch in Judy Bob Herbert writes in the New York Times says voters be more so on bush and don't let me forget about bush's booze crisis again I don't think I well well what's the great well we destroy more than once during the show that's bad that's really bad no we don't we don't have people listening all four hours and such as shocking innocent in the inquiries so it actually might be true as opposed to like if it was in the local fish rappers or like if I what about the thing with a Palm Beach posted we checked that thing out no no well Josh was all gone whole there above me oh we get the Palm Beach post a little bit right here might have that you have it now we don't but I know that Howard's broadcasting from WFA and studio from the fan art hall hanging out with I wow he's hanging out with who I'm isn't I'm just on this thing hang out with I'm as well as a couple of dottering old cons but you see there you go again you start to meet him and mobile so don't go no no no no you crusty old could he's at the fan I'm under a lot of time is not any gum over form maybe just maybe Bob Herbert writes the public is beginning to see through the toxic fog of fantasy propaganda and deliverers representation that has been such a hallmark of the George W. Bush administration which is in danger being judged by history is one of the worst of all time Mr. Bush's approval ratings have tanked as increasing numbers of Americans worry that their president seems to like nothing better than running off of his ranch to clear a brush and write his bike may not be up to the job the most recent New York Times CBS news full strongly indicated that the public tired of the war without indina rack and is made by the federal responsibility catastrophe in the world has growing doubts about the president's capacity deal with pressing problems a USA today CNN Gallup poll found for the first time that a majority of Americans do not seem as to Bush as a strong decisive leader in an article in USA today Carol Dordy of the nonpartisan Pew Research Center said of Mr. Bush he's lost ground among independence he seems to be starting to lose ground among his own party and he lost the Democrats a long time ago reality is cabian on a president who has held a law for so long by a combination of ideological number jumbo the public relations led you to main of Carl Roe and the point patriotism that followed those nine eleven attacks the boys people were never big on reality so sooner or later they were bomb a blindsided by it sooner or later remember there was always a war going on when Katrina came to call I've always believed that war is a serious matter but the president was on vacation the cheney was on vacation and condy rice was here in New York taking in the sights and shopping for shoes that Americans were fighting in die on foreign soil was not enough to admit demand their full attention they were busy having fun so it's no wonder it took a good long while before they noticed that a whole sex of America and in wiped out in a calamity of biblical proportions but Americans are finally catching on it was the uttering confidence of this crowd and if we didn't know before we're learning now in a harshest possible ways then incompetence has bitter consequences as we'd Q.A.M. have learned the body kind of Americans killed in Iraq is now past 1900 with many more deaths to come but there's still no strategy no plan the White House hasn't got the slightest clue about what to do so the dying will continue mr. Bush's top gun moment of over the aircraft carrier ablinking was two and a half years ago another example of the president and fantasy land the war was a bot from the beginning mr. Bush never said enough troops to get the job done and he never provided enough armor to protect the troops that he did send since in the prison government of anybody where the timidiness of the jesse might be wrong about some of the decisions he was making here at home even loyal republicans are beginning to bail out on mr. Bush's finished willingness to shove the monumental cost of the federal government's operations including his war as tax cuts and his promised reconstruction to go up coast out of the unsuspecting facts of generations still to come there's a general sense now that things are falling apart the economy was already following before Katrina gas prices are starting to undermine the standard living of some americans and a full blown home heating law crisis could erupt as winner the administration's awful response to the agony of the Gulf coasts left the western Americans believing that we're not prepared to cope with the large terrorist attack and Osama is still at large this is what happens when voters choose a president because he seems like a nice guy if someone would be funded a barbecue or a ballgame you never use that criterion when choosing a surgeon or a pilot to fire your fan fan fly your family across the country mr. Bush will be at the helm of the ship of state for three more years so we have no choice but to hang on but the next time around voters need to keep in mind that beyond the incestion e-maring about left and right big government and small democrats and republicans is a more immediate issue and that's competence oh competence what's that you're pretty good question is we've been wondering a long time here at q a m all i will say the audio whilst been working all day let's hear it for engineering maybe they're the best one day in a row they are sensational one thirteen at five sixty w q a m o

What's like he's carrying a phone and phone between a diamond-high? The diamond-high. The diamond-high. He said it means a small hug. As if he'd always been the star. He went away when she was caught. But her voice had caught me down with her. I really, really, really gave a short point. And said, push, not that bad, you know. But her voice, he'll be returned back. And felt that I felt like a star. And I felt that I felt like a star. But her voice, she said, well, now you're just going to be the star. And I'm not bad, I'm not bad. I'm not bad. I'm not bad. Well, that's what's going to be the thousandth. In fact, if I refer to it, I bet you've got like a thousand. I shouldn't have for anything now. Because the thousand, look at that. Isn't that great? It's wonderful. Now, we're not going to push it because they came through. Thanks to Josh Cortis for doing a great job getting that story under about bushes. And mainly, I'm thinking because, in the early, second, read it off of there as opposed to the teeny tiny print from the inquire of thing on there. If you could see some of these things that I read, you have to add them on Palomar telescope to print this whole time. You know, oh, how to get you some magnivision reading glass. No thanks. But before that, before the bush, you're a bad, well, bush stuff. Your fan asks Governor Bush. But everywhere you look, there's another bush. No comment. Governor Bush warns Hurricane Rita could set off a gas crisis and floored it. Oh, my God. And you like that. Not that we want you to get nervous, anything like that. Governor, you're a fan ask Governor Jim Bush. We're ready in this morning, conserve fuel as the monstrous Rita bears down on the Texas Gulf Coast and the hard donations oil industry. No need to panic raising like that, but, I wouldn't go out and get a bicycle just in case. And all likely, Hitler going to have significant shortages of gasoline and every day I would urge people to recognize this. Not to hoard, not to top off every tank that they have. Bush told reporters in Tallahassey. We have a plan and place that we're dealing with to bring supply back to our state. Thank you very much, your fat ask Governor for those low gas prices and your brother. less than four weeks ago, Hurricane Kewel, we know about that. Price is rose more than 40 cents almost overnight from Katrina, cars back 20 deep at a number of central Florida stations, some ran out altogether, and really could do even worse. Oh my God. The storm is heading toward an even larger part of our refined capacity than the War of Inzermissah Zimbe, Bushby said, that's your fat ass governor, Bush, not to be confused with his dumb ass brother. People need to recognize this is a national problem. This is not a state problem, Bush said, we all need to play our part. Meanwhile, Bush said that among the one point family in the evacuees are his parents. That's why I play that bit. His parents used to dress in a former president George Herbert Walker, Bush, and his wife, Barbara. Darop and Washington, Governor Bush said the fat ass governor, the house is all boarded up. All right, they're not going to stick around. They're not going to waste for the big blow. How come if it's not good enough for all those wonderful people or so much better off than them where we for? Well, I guess the Bush's will not be better all. I guess that's it, right. It would be really great not to have to evacuate. More than seven, most we much as do that, 1100. I don't know. This audience might come through for us. Anyway, here's that story. Bush's booze crisis. It's in the National Enquirer by Jennifer loose and Don Jim Teal. Faced with the biggest crisis of his political life president Bush has hit the bottle again, the National Enquirer Kim reveal. Bush who said he quit drinking the morning after his 40th birthday has started boozing him at the Katrina Katanstrophy. Family sources of told how the 59 year old president was caught by First Lady Laura, downing a shot of booze of their family ranch and Crawford Texas, when he learned that the hurricane disaster, his worried wife yelled at him, stop George following these shocking incident, this goes here for the first time. Laura privately warned her husband again, falling off the wagon and piloted travel with him more. So often that's he with more often so she can keep an eye on W. The sources add. When the Lemme's broke into Orleans, it apparently made him reach for a shot to one insider. He poured himself a Texasized shot of straight whiskey and tossed it back. The first lady was shocked and shouted, stop George. Laura gave an ultimatum before it's Jim Beam or me. She doesn't want to replay that nightmare, especially now when it says tough going for Hubby. Bush is out of the worst pressure of his two terms in office and his popularity is near an all time low as we know. How low can he go? The handling of the Katrina crisis and true losses in a rack if you're a public discontent and pushed Bush back to drink. A Washington source said the said fact is that he's been sneaking drinks for a week now, which now Laura may have only just caught him, but the word is his drink has been gone on for a while in the capital. He's been in a pressure cooker for months. The war in Iraq, the loss of American lives, has deeply affected him. He takes every soldier's life personally. It's left him emotionally drained. The result is he's taking drinks here and there and likely in private to cope. And now with the worst domestic crisis in his administration over Katrina, you pray is drinking those gluttony control. You pray and I'm on his surprise to hear that we hadn't taken a shot sooner before Katrina, he was at his with end. I've known him for years. He's been a good old Texas boy forever. George had a drinking problem for years that most professionals will say needed therapy. He doesn't believe in therapy, he never got it. He drank his way through his youth through college and well into his 30s. Everybody around him is drinking. Another source said, the family I'm going to told me they feared George is falling apart. The first lady's been assigned the job of a thing date keeper. Bush's history of drinking dates back to his youth, thinking of his time as young man in the national guard. He said, one thing I remember and I'm most proud of is my drinking and partying. Those were the days my friends, those were the good old days. At age 26 and 1972 he reportedly rounded off an ice boozing with a 16 year old brother Marvin by challenging his father to a fight. November 1, 2000, even his first presidential election, Bush acknowledged that in 76 he was erected for driving out of influence of booze to his parents home in Maine, age 30 at the time. Bush clearly guilty and paid $150 fine. He's driving privileges were temporarily suspended in Maine. I'm not proud of that. He said, I made some mistakes. I occasionally drank too much and I did that night. I learned my lesson. I'm not the interview with that time. He said, well, I don't think I had an addiction. It's hard for me to say, I've had friends who were very addicted and he required hitting bottom to start going to AA. I don't think I would that was my case. He had to go to AA, you know, which a not alcoholics anonymous, but a holes on anonymous. Where do they meet here? During in Crawford during his 2000 presidential campaign, there were also persistent questions about past cocaine use. Eventually, Bush denied using cocaine after 1992, then quickly extended the cocaine from period back to 74 when he was 28. Dr. Justin Franco, Washington DC, psychiatrist and author of Bush on the couch, inside mind of the president told the national inquire, I do think that Bush is drinking again. Alcoholics who are not in any program like the president have a hard time when stress gets to be too great. I think it's a concern he says that Bush disappears during times of stress. He spends so much time on its rant. It's very frightening. It's a good doctor. It says, how do you like that maple? From New York, was feeling and Georgia is losing while over. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62. Dilkable, and they don't come any better than Todd Keller. New, the WB from the creators of Supernatural, Pamela Anderson stars in Super, but not natural. Why those things here? I don't know that's a thing. I'm really excited, but always wanted to have my breakfast and national television to listen to it. On the David Hill show with the day time, I'm really excited. I could go, cutting drop, body brand on you, just to keep under wraps. Like if we use it to make a water landing, just huge exploitation devices has to attack. Super, but not natural. I'm getting big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big films in Silicon Valley. It's dying this year when you're giant, you lose. I'm not a hard batch, I'm not a hard batch. 145. So anyway, this is pretty interesting, missing from my new times. I'm not going to read it, but about WFTLA-50 was once and always is a local talk. Now it's just another haven for hate rights, Bob Norman, whoever that is. And of course Norman, Elliot, can't eat no longer on there, on E50. Now let's see, isn't that the station where all, I hope that they really proud of their, a PD Lenny and Tommy Dennerberg and Bob Lysenberg. Is that the station where they're working now at 50? FTO? I don't know. I do believe. And now I've been only to have nothing but right wing of hate on there, all they need, reports and the Kelly Mitchell and this, of course Bill O'Reilly. And not to mention the worst of all, and Michael Savage, who got tossed off M.S.N.B.C. for calling a, for telling a caller that he was a side of might and should die of AIDS. Stuff like that. Anyway, the hard, cool. And my new times, pick it up. And read about what they've done, and that's how I've done this for, but they're up there right wing of hate. Sick, it's bigoted nasty hate, that's 850 on the dial. Hope that all their sponsors are real proud of the crap that they're putting on, dig it between a hate, 24 or 790, and 50, that's how desperate they are to try to find an audience, lovely. Well, work for Fox, I guess they might figure worse for them. Finally, now, finally, and I do mean finally, they get into it. New Orleans rain raises new funding fears. Haven't I been taught, squawk it about that all day, since like nine this morning? Yes. Since before the show went on, we were talking about this. We were confabulating. Outer bands have ran from Hurricane Weedy began falling into Orleans to in four cast of between three and five inches of rainfall in the coming days. Race fears that the patched levee system could fail and flood the city all over again. A direct hit from Weedy was still unlikely. And by the way, Hurricane I was category four. It's not 150 mile a hour, one's down to a cat four. But still, keep in mind what Katrina came on, sure, was a cat four. But anyway, the storm veered on more notably cores toward a Saturday landfall in Texas that put to Orleans on the eastern edge of tropical storm warning. Read his reigns and predict the three to four foot storm search could bring to Orleans dangerous lake close to predictions that the fractured levees can handle only up to six inches of rain and the storm surge of 10 to 12 feet. And they're saying didn't Mayor Bonehead didn't she say like 20 foot search, they're looking for? They're both. Right now it's a wait and see and hope for the best at Army Corps of Engineers spokesman Mitch Fraser. The end of the new forecast brought renewed urgency to ensure our levees would sandbags and bring in more portable pumps. Maybe the one at the judge was using none of the, as robs they can bring that one in. Slightly used. Yeah. Today's showers with the first measurable rainfall in New Orleans since Hurricane Katrina's August 29th landfall broke the levees in several places and flood an 80% of the city. Only spotty showers of falling in mid-morning. But forecast you said there could be brief periods of heavy downpours as Rita's outer squad bands move through, which is what I've been saying all freaking day and later I know nothing. But unless you're deaf dumb and blind, you can see it. Fraser said the biggest concern was the storm surge, which the National Hurricane Center will be three to four feet above normal and parts of Louisiana. Mississippi effected by Katrina. But a slight turn could increase that dramatically. A title surge of 15 to 20 feet was expected from Corpus Christi, Texas, a Christi, Texas. This South Central Louisiana. Is that akin to like Luke Christie? And no doubt. Lightning strikes. Oh, when you're leasing over. Oh boy. I can't even hear say a 10 to 12 foot surge was required to overtake the levees at 17th Street and London Canal in New Orleans. But a neighboring St. Bernard Paris, a surge of five to six feet, was all that was needed to swamp the area again. If the levees fail again, the areas of New Orleans that are most likely to flood over the same neighborhoods that they did by Katrina, many of which have been drive for less than a week. It's a quick fast rain and we'll see localized flooding for you just said there is no doubt about that. The process of getting the water from Katrina was nearly complete with only about 10% of the city still flooded. And of course, confident it will be able to quickly pump it out again. All this other stuff is materialized, Pronto. Searchers continue looking for bodies in homes that have been locked or submerged under Katrina's highest floodwater. It's pushing the overall body count packed of 1,000. That's all in Louisiana still is 799, increase of 153 since the weekend, nearly 80% of the 136 deaths attributed to Katrina across the Gulf Co. 3 in our in Louisiana. Officials said the body search could last another 46 weeks and could yield many more dead. There still could be quite a few especially in the deepest blood area, a US coast guard captain, Jeff and Peter, some of the houses they had even looked in yet. Mark Hyman, a female field spokesman, said the searches will continue, but officials were keeping close eye on the weather. Special reconnaissance teams are looking for solid buildings and solid buildings, rock solid in such areas in case rescue we need to rush to higher ground. Don't know, but they sure haven't been talking about this very much, but like I said, you take a look at that and you say to yourself, oh my God. Oh boy, I'd bet in down the old hatches and hit for natches and get their lives out of there. Now, some of those stubborn, see, this is the thing, stubborn people that stay behind. I know we're supposed to be sympathetic for everybody and value human life. But if they have no value under all of whom, hone human life and then that's stupid, why don't we be all bent out of shape about it, right? They had that going on during Mount St. Helen's. Remember there were people that wouldn't go in the eye and they'd be able to stand the people that are disabled and people have, but this time they're getting everybody out right away so that we don't have that embarrassing disaster again, but I can understand that. They don't have the ability to get out. But the bottom line is if they do and they're just sitting around to be stubborn and stupid. If I had the ability to see, maybe Alice Bennett is under all of that, is drowning over there. Wonder what ever happened? Oh, that's for he's on scare America. I remember Norma told me that he walked out of that studio in New York and there was Alex Bennett sitting there. What I've seen, my bald head, it's stupid. Look, 151 at QAM. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5.62A. Did I thank you? Please be seated. I want to remind people that who might be listening that this administration is a group of frustrated and desperate people who kill innocent life. And America's out of view at a such. And now I'll be glad to take some of your questions. Terry wants you to start. Thank you, Mr. President. As you know, New Orleans is destroyed. Thousands are dead and countless families are now homeless. I'd like to get your thoughts on this overwhelming problem. Oh, we don't have a problem. Less ignore it. Sir, my not remind you that you have a responsibility as the commander and chief to step up and act on the people's behalf. Okay, here's what I intend to do about it. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. I'm curious if you're worried that your poor handling of her came to Trio will lead to your downfall in Washington, to be seen. Oh, we're about anything here in Washington, DC. I mean, I feel comfortable in my role as the president. In my role in the president is to push terrible disease in order to destroy life. And I have made my position very clear on that issue. David. Thank you, Mr. President. Thousands of stragglers remain stranded in New Orleans surrounded by a raw sewage and without food. What is your administration proposing they eat? No. Doody. Listen, thank you all for coming out and joining us. No problem at all. Okay, anytime of photo-op. It's 158. Moist coming up next from the fan of New York Grand Pommo. Oh, 147 votes today. See, it's a good thing we didn't push for 10000. Do you want to know why? Why? Because when you set the bar to high, oh, yeah. Then you have to keep like topping it. And top, you know what I'm saying? I know. My altitude now is if the week they have 1,000 votes during the show and any pool, we're a kick-and-serious ass. So I'm saying we're doing just fine. As in ball, we're fine. Anyway, I've all the things that Neil talks about, which is the least interesting to you, hockey. I mean, make no mistake about it. This is not a hockey town. Hockware, niche games, trying to cook about hockey. 281, that's what the Chinese say. What do they know about it? Ever seen any Chinese hockey players? Yeah, you gotta tell me that. Actually, there was a, I think Japanese, and I mean, my Michael Park, how they were, there's a new one. New one. A new Japanese hockey player, not an invention. How you know that? I read the story about it. Hockie, what's stop with a hockey talk? 211, the track 195, G-Stop 97. Yeah, no more factory. Mo 96, no more. Diet talk 88, the stock market 58, inside radio stuff only 47. See those bedtime stories only 42 down to 4% even. They actually love them. Power of 32, religion's 28. And so then, 25, health problems 16, music only 15 over doing a lot of music shows, not movies, eight and food only seven. And I never reminded me to put that damn brat we're still on there, damn. Oh, hey, don't forget that brat we're still. Okay, let me go ahead of my meat. Anyway, we got to mobilize your coming up next, ramp on mold from the fan in New York. Hi, bye, bye.
