He's a maniac! I hate the song. It's a looping. I agree. They play that song a song that's often games all the time. Yeah, really. That's another reason not to go against. And those silly cheerleaders are all the same. Who would want a Dolphins man there on the way? Oh yeah. I had a guy call earlier today. He's expecting to see the Dolphins and Denver in the playoffs. Oh yeah. Against each other again. Right. No question about it. Oh wait. What happened to that Kansas he Denver game last night? I didn't want to wait. Kansas, Denver just crushed them. Did you know he would crush Kansas City? Yeah. They Denver looked like a different team from the one I shared. Oh. Boy, when I said parody, man, the league is just mostly just bottom feeders. It's trash. You know, I was saying that maybe Ronnie Brown's game against Denver wasn't so bad because he didn't run very well against him. Nobody's run well against him. They're run defense is very good. Yeah. But they suck. Jake Plummer is a joke. But never left. He wasn't last night. I'm glad I didn't want that. He wasn't last night. I'm sure. Didn't have to watch him. Much of that game last night. It was over in the first quarter. Didn't watch the Marlin. He made the last night. Didn't miss any Marlin runs I guess. Didn't miss AJ Bernadgott and San Juan. Didn't miss Jack McKenzie. I'm all finished. I'm done. Jack was on with us today. Yeah. What do you say? Is he done? He says he likes managing. Oh. And what? It was good. Have any of you with us this year, Jack. I enjoy talking baseball with you, which I do. And Jack said, hopefully we can do it again next year. Well, I'll be damned. But I don't know. He hasn't decided yet. And he said he still might change his mind. But they might make their minds up. His mind up for him. You know, he only turns 95 next year. He's just like me. His stangeless. He wants to be the second oldest guy ever to manage. If you manage one more year, you can do that. I'll be damned. Well, if he doesn't do it, you won't. I can go into managing. And it's like, we're old enough. A movie. If it comes on, your TV do not watch it under any circumstances. There was a movie couple of weeks ago. I got stuck into watching because it said it had four stars. Yeah. And state. Peace of crap. Oh, I hear that's awful. And last night, I watched a movie. It had three stars on the bottom thing. And I cut her from the beginning. Unfortunately, it was the worst. Most depressing piece of turd. I've ever seen called the anniversary party. You know, Garden State is about where I grew up. I've seen it. They filmed it in a town where I grew up. Turingill. I thought Garden State raised track. Right. That's all I know. I don't know what you're laughing about. I've been there, Mr. I've been there too. Yeah. I went there when I was in high school. You used to go opening day. Yeah. I'm talking about for a harness race. They built it. They built it with the idea of putting casinos in there. Because they thought that they were going to get the permit to put casinos outside of the land of city. And so the interior was just really glitzzy and beautiful. And never materialized. And of course they went out of business. Yeah. Sanito. Not at the Garden State. I think it was filmed in North Jersey. We were right at the area where I grew up. And North? Yeah. So people have told me you gotta go see it. It's about your hometown. North Jersey considered like a teen egg or a tenor fly around there. Yeah. Yeah. I roommate from college was from tenor fly. I know what it is. A horrible place. I lived in South Orange. Oh boy. Anyway, Jennifer Jason Lee, Alan coming and a bunch of other big names actually, Jane Adams, John C. Riley, Parker Posey. Yeah. Are there all in this movie anniversary party? Do not watch it. It's highly touted. A lot of stars. I'm reading the reviews online. I wonder if these people are taking the same ecstasy that the people in the movie were taken or some other kind of drug because it was just putrid. Just putrid. And by the way, anybody out there if it comes around your cable, the dog comes back home at the end of goes inside. Okay. That's it. That tells me everything I need to know about that movie. The dog comes home at the end. Dog is the word for that movie. Just a piece of crap. Oh, and a guy that husband gets to call from dad and his sister that he wasn't returning her phone calls committed suicide. And he's upset. That's it. Okay. And they're all stoned off their ass on ecstasy and they're all like trying to drown in the pool. And it's just, oh man. So bad. They're no words to describe it. And it's highly touted. Highly touted. I just don't get it. So Denver beats the crap out of Kansas City. Well, Kansas City must be really suspect then. Yeah. They look bad last night. The quarterback was bad. They couldn't run the ball. Yeah. Carable. Oh, he looks good to me. And they couldn't throw the ball. They couldn't run the ball. They were just bad. You can answer. Mike and pull on our poll today. My poll question is sports oriented. Okay. Never did this for me for me. Who's your all time favorite software athlete? But this is just in general generic. You're all time favorite athlete. Now let me give you what we got so far. Okay. Of the first 21 and 10 votes. Danny Boy, Dan Murray, or 67, which makes sense in South Florida. I hate sports 65. That's our hostile people out there. Mickey, Natalie, team. Willie Mayster, team. Babe, Ruth, Tan, Bobby, or 10. Wayne, Gretsky, or Shack, five. Say it again. Oh, Bob, greasy, five. Mario, let me you four. Tiger Woods, three. And I put him on the, even though I don't consider golf to be a sport. But never to game. Tom Brady, three, and Johnny Barre, one. I was my vote. My favorite athlete is Pat Allen's willow. That's bad. Well, these didn't say Gary Bean anyway. You know what's interesting? I'll give me a real name for you. You know what, you know something? It was it. As soon as you said it, the first two names. Place in front of me. One was magic Johnson. I always enjoyed watching him play basketball. All right. And the other name was Manl. And that was who I like growing up. Yeah. You know, I did two. Manl was my favorite ball player. No, I'd favorite play was Hank Bauer. Same team. Yeah. Number nine. Oh, Hank Bauer was great. Yep. The general. He was a hard-nosed, uh, you clutch real clutch. Yeah, he was great. And tremendous fielder. Yeah. Great arm. Oh, phenomenal. He was my, he was a guy who was, uh, golfered at the Royal Crom buddy. Where they had the ball at the Copic Cabana. Yeah, and Bauer was still, was there. And if all the guys were involved in that video, it was billi Martin man, all a couple other people of all the guys I wouldn't want to, Tangle with Bauer would be the guy. That was a lot of long for. We all leave. I didn't like that, too. I didn't know that Mel Brooks wrote that show. Did he really? That was in the old bit today. That's what convinced him to play the role. Mel Brooks is still alive, isn't he? Yes. And his wife, Mr. and Bankroft. Yes, he died. And Bankroft died? Yeah. No, a few months ago. Did he really? Yeah. So many people died. I can't keep track anymore. And Bankroft died? Yes. Who not only started, but also wrote the screenplay for Fatso. Did you see Fatso? Yeah, sure. What a great movie. Was classic. It was fantastic. In fact, we had the guy, what was the guy's name, George? They're not very, a lot, a lot of the other guy. Richard. Tom, I mean, you. Was his name? Richie Carrin. Richie Carrin. He called out his show one time, where somebody had him calling. Yeah. That was a classic. Yeah. But Mel Brooks created, gets smart. But with somebody else who was a very famous comedian. Yeah. I don't remember who that was. Well, we'll find out. Foupey Compos, something like that. Suppy sales. Exactly. Well, that's about it. Don't go to New Orleans, by the way. The air is unfit to breathe. And the water is unfit to drink. And the, uh, all kinds of stuff going on. Okay. I'm going to see your Thursday. Sounds like there's not much better there. Why, sir? He is not fit to breathe. And the water is not fit to drink. Oh, well, we know that. The service, I said that to George before the show this morning, that there are a lot of people in New York going to wind up dying from infosimmon, other bronchial diseases because I'm loving them. But nobody wants to talk about that. Just keep it quiet because it's a lot of lawsuits will become them. Okay. Now, you doing the show from other fan? No. I'm doing a show from a place that's not too far from Belmont because that's where I have a life right. Make sense. Probably have a runner to take the bets. You don't have to do that. I could make the best myself and watch it on TVG. There you go. But no, I, there's a guy up there who has a studio in his house right in your garden city. Oh, but you know, what a concept having a studio right in your house? Yeah, exactly. And so I always go there and then Monday, I'll be doing a show from Charlotte from a station and then Tuesday, I'm not going to work. What does that mean? It's a Jewish New Year. You know, I was like, okay, a Jewish Tuesday. Yeah. Well, I don't have next week's schedule here. So I don't, I don't know from that. And yum, kipper is the following Thursday. Well, good. I'm going to become very Jewish this year. I think I'm going to start taking the Jew holidays off. I'm not sure what you think. I would. I would. Why not? Yeah. I'll sue their ass for religious discrimination if they should mess them with me. Hey, I worked on Thomas. Huh? I always work on Christmas. So I make up for what those days. I work on the Gloria Shahalades. That's the way to do it. Yeah. They have far fewer than we have. You know, K&T speaking of our conversation yesterday about Sid Levine. It was really very amusing because every Jewish holiday. In fact, what the heck was the receptionist? The firm was that her name was the Blackness Fniscroller. Very nice young lady. And everybody including her became Jewish on the Jewish holidays. If he's was a ghost town, only those of us on the year were working. Nobody else there. Well, I have this game to cover Monday night and Charlotte. Then I'm going to fly back to his day. Well, that's the pressing about the Denver beating the crap out of Kansas City. That means that the whole league is just garbage, which is good news for me because it means a Patriot's a public government. Although without Rodney Harrison, I see he's out for the other. I think that's the reason I think I support him. That's really important. That's crucial, man. He's great. He was great. Career threatening. They said this injury. Yeah. It's not good. Well, we want to give everybody else a fighting chance. Yeah. Now everybody thinks that the offense will wall-sin because everybody's getting hurt. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry without. Just have no quarterbacks. That roughest burger said that Tom Brady is by far the best quarterback in the league. Now just a best quarterback. But he's his by far the best. I had a question this morning asking me if Brady, if his career ended today, would he be in a whole of fame? And I say yes. I would agree. I mean, sayers played five years and went in a whole of fame. But this guy... How many superables did he win or how many championships did he win? He didn't. No. In this case, you know, you look at Brady. Not just the... I'm sorry about this. I'm sorry about this. Then, we know it's all about the championship. I mean, Danny just went into how many did he win? Oh, that's right, Henry. But he broke all the records. Oh, yeah, I understand that. But no, I'm not doubting he belongs in there, but I'm just saying. And he wins three. Yeah. It's like, I'm doing it. Well, nobody wants another Joe. On that note. Did you say nobody wants another Mo? There you go. Again. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. You're not going to get all agreed. Oh, no, no, no, no. The O'er's not provoking to her. Oh, no, no, no, no. I have a great day and don't lose too much.

How did you sleep last night in a recent National Survey by the National Sleep Foundation?

I don't know, I mean, Brown, what I mean, what's with the B? He's somewhere in Texas, you for it And he's got that, you know, remember we did the poll about one word Describes bush the best, yeah I've got to the thing in advance, I don't think we even put it on there You know what it is, because I looked at him, I showed that tip of him being given the tour The grantor, all the devastating damage there in Beaumont You know what the word is? I give up pathetic, oh, yeah Perfect, he really is He's failed that everything he's ever done You know, they spoon fed him, they've been put him in the world business to baseball business Every business he ever went into, he failed And then they stole him two elections and again he failed Yeah, but why do you hate America? Former FEMA Director Michael Brown told Congress today he made specific mistakes in leading the initial Federal government response to Hurricane Katrina The Brown also blamed state local officials for government failures Not that he wants to point to think of anything like that or play the blame game Brown told a special congressional panel that Luzia and Governor Kathleen Blankhead And the warlanes may array in Nagan, we're not coordinating their efforts And that he should have done more to persuade them to do so He suggested that the FEMA agency had gotten a bum wrap because many people incorrectly believes It serves as something of a federal rapid response force FEMA is a coordinating agency, we're not allowed for some agencies He said, but now it's in here, there's this line We'll just make you do wild things in your pants It is inherently impractical, totally impractical for the federal government To respond to every disaster of whatever size and every community across the country Brown said In other words, this one no thing, every time somebody gets a hang now, we're supposed to be there Right, stand and go to feet It breaks my heart to think about the disasters we respond to as FEMA and the think about the disasters We also don't respond to he added Oh my god, Democrats wanted an independent investigation out of the control of majority of Republicans Largely boycott of the hearing At the end of the day, I suspect we'll find that government and all levels All the people who see an administrative and Alabama and the Gulf Coast They come in the chairman Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia Democrats mostly in poor Canada because they're just a white wash, just a bunch of crap Wife away star time with this 770 votes, we're not gonna make a thousand acres without pushing for it Plus we don't have enough names on it, which we will, we got 711 Let's go there, let's go get a big gulp WQA envelope WQA, hello Hey, I was trying to ask you, I was quite Johnny notice was it on that pole Johnny had it a soul number 19, you got a man All right, thanks a lot Thanks, Johnny, I just how come he's not under Johnny you Huh? Yeah These people are comparing a Peyton Manning to Johnny and I just need mental health Okay, in fact Peyton Man, you notice how the cults don't screw any points There's season interaction to just getting by a defense Are you saying that he's not good? Oh no he's really not no Johnny and I this, there's a difference between good and great Okay, I mean, I haven't had a disagree with you Do you think he's a great quarterback Peyton Sandy Peyton Manning I'm pretty sure he set the record for touchdown passes last year. So, what did he win? Oh, you have to win a Super Bowl to be good. What do you have to do? You have to win champion, so you have to be in a big dance. Did he go to the Super Bowl to even play in a Super Bowl? No. You better learn your J.U.N.I. to history, Mr. because you sure don't know it. You know Jimmy or from Bobby or you better start to get on the Glenn Wagon. You better have current sit you down and give you some sports history. When you have some real boring spare time. When you're like watching the hospital, a George C. Scott, I'm going to go out and get a just to piss off George. All right, yeah, you can. I think you're like it. I think you're like it. I mean, it's, you know, it's, I don't know. Actually, when I'm going to do isn't going to watch it again first by myself. And then I'll decide whether I'll send her a minute. Take it to temperature. Yeah. I'll stick my thermometer and see if it's got a fever. What do you want? WQA and hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. I'm going to be fishing for the Paul in a hotheat and a surprise Bobby. How was it, there he is? Bobby, you hold, old number nine. He wanted to make a really broad hotheat up to which, you know, to which peak in the late, it's generally something. Once he retarded, waiting to win down with him, I mean, he's a great guy. But I won't dispute that. I think he's always very good. He was good. He could really shoot a man. No, and well, I don't, you're not going to hear it at all. Paul, he's a very popular rat. You even know he is a guy. I think he talked to you a lot of work to be run. Oh, who is an Arnold Palmer? Yeah, he would. Yeah. That's a good question. Farvel, put a monitor for Arnold Palmer and Bobby, how you got him? And as always, we're putting on the honor on there. What about Jack Nicholice, huh? He's, well, let's say, he'll get votes. It's first in South Florida, he and his whole family will probably vote for him. You know, I don't want to go through the whole thing about golf again. It's just, it's just a tremendous incredible waste of time and money and effort, you know, and the crowd is all hushed, you know, and it's just, it just makes me nauseous. But it kills some good time, I guess, for some very board people. WQA, I'm hello. And you know, how about Mark Dufers, 24th, half-organist, Rick Blair? Anybody else? No, I do. Okay, this is eight. Can't leave those. You can't leave about nine. I can't. I can't keep you happy. I can't keep you. Too many for me, okay. We don't want to list. We want one. Make up your mind, okay. Make up your mind. Who is your favorite all-time athlete? I couldn't give an list, you know, I could have said, oh, a bunch of people. Frank Mahavoloch and all kind. I could have put my buddy Ray Whitney on there. But I didn't. I voted for old Johnny Bower. Because that's the ultimate answer. I could have put Francis O'Hare on another old guy, great driver at the Hezelt Park in North Irland, the Wolverine Ray. Old Francis O'Hare bought cash. A lot of tickets on old Frank. Long since did. 72 man, there's an athlete. Not some guy at the Wonders run on the golf course. Like the Tiger and Arne and Jack Nick was, those blue nose A-holes, but nevertheless. That was good about Bobby Holla. That's good about. Let's get hockey intensive. Oh, hockey season. Let's get Rimmer on a phone and have a, in fact, when I go on vacation in the couple of ways, George is going to be doing a hockey show with Jeff Irmer every day. Yeah, so I'm. Yes. I, yes, I want to speak to you. Speaking. That's not new. It sure is. It looks like me. Just looked down. It's mine. It's me. I'm going to teach you what to do. I'm going to teach you how to do. How's it going, eh? It's going, eh. But I'm in Florida. We don't have about 16 years now. I'll be there. Yeah, but I'm so, while he was face up and pro, just in case you change her mind. I have a joke for you. We don't do jokes. You don't do jokes. All good. It's good. We still don't do jokes. Have you got a name for our poll? Yes, Gary Cohen. Gary Cohen. Gary Cohen. Good looking at the hockey. Gary Cohen, the Jackie. The Jackie, yeah. The Hank doesn't know who it is. Sorry? Gary Cohen, the Jackie that was in Florida. Okay, thanks. Thanks for your time. How's it going? Gary Cohen. I know his brother Marty. Yeah. Good for you. That's going to be one of the most bizarre calls because I keep, don't let me forget tomorrow. I'm across over with, bring up that thing about Gary Cohen again. Well, I'm sure it's probably not related to David Cohen who's writing California now. But there he goes with hockey and horse racing. And we told you on the poll yesterday, the other day, man. We don't want to hear about hockey, horse racing or a whole load of the three ages. No more of the three ages. Okay. Is that what he said? Tocky was number one horse racing number two and hey, home O talk was number three. This is Neil Rogers. This is for nobody can't steal. I'll tell you that. I'm about taking it and the behind where was FEMA. Broken everything steamer was nowhere inside. FEMA. Even with one aim, the FEMA's boss was in bright. When the storm was over, water was everywhere. But the biggest disaster was that Mexico beat you there. Baby FEMA. No better contra. They went to Haliburton. FEMA. Response more quickly when it's rich people hurt and when it's rich people hurt and I'm dying on the hair. FEMA. You're going to pay your pants when you hear this next thing I would have passed along to you. Second thing. First of all, I hope not because I really have to go. Trust me you will. You won't have time to go. 75. Who's your favorite? Why should go now and pee now while I do the poll? Oh no, it's not that bad. Or just dribble on the floor there. I got the waste basket. Your all time, well, probably could make the smell any worse than that studio from what you're telling me. But that right. 170 nobody's going to touch Danny boy with those real funky lips. Hall of Flamer man Dan Marino. He could play. I hate sports 123. 16.5% of the science just. They're like that. They don't like it. We want it. They don't want it. We like it. They don't like it.

Oh, and that's kind of surprising. You know votes for Terry Bradshaw. Is it? Why? Why is that surprising? Because you want to hold much of super bowls. Even though he's one of the artists with the steers. We're here in Florida. They don't have any steers. Down here. And how they don't? I haven't seen any. Yeah, that's what it was. So anyway, here's the thing that was going to make you just. You're maybe already know about it about kiss. No, what about it? Oh, here we go. Hang on tight. Hold on. Usually looking to immerse yourself in that southern rebel country music. No. South Florida's country music station WKISFM kiss 99.9 is launching this week a high definition radio station that will carry a mighty cry of what kiss marking director Sandy Sloan calls. A town yet attitude. How the hell? Yeah, like that. With this form, you just rock and out the whole time, Sloan said, We'll be playing a lot of that southern rock that doesn't have a real niche. So as you want to hear, but can't find in South Florida. Well, it covers a lot of territory. Because if you can't find a southern South Florida, that means that something anybody do want to hear. So we're going to be having a lot of Molly hatch it. Well, I'm going to tell you right now. That's trash and glycid. All men brothers van Charlie Daniels van Leonard skitter Travis Trent Toby Keith and nice wedding zooner kiss plays more mainstream country Tunes Sloan said whatever I don't know what that means called Gretchen 99.9 the HD station is inspired by the South Had or Redneck woman Gretchen Wilson, which released a latest album all jacked up this week. Is that Gretchen Wilson? No, it's Florida's hit it. Oh, they're in Skinner. I can't hear it. So I don't want to hear it. I like it. I like it. It's going to just fine. Okay. Are they still dead by the way the president died in the crank? Yes. The station, oh, my name is based easily broadcast group is one of some 200 HD outlets across the country, including Beastly's Power 96 is dancers in the electronic station and National Public Radio affiliate WLRN FM's 91.3 classical music station HD HD is cutting it cutting it It's technology that offers crystal queer CD quality sound, but the signal can only be captured if you have a special HD receiver. Anybody out there got one? No. HD receivers costing some 250 to see if their bus are stated to be widely available for this holiday season. Gretchen 99.9 will be Steve Loss being live on kiss.com as well as overall the year on HD2 99.9. What does that mean? HD2. I don't know. I guess that's some fangled HD talk. We don't know about because we don't got no HD radio. And of course, we're like digital stereo, something around AM, but nobody, there is nobody alive who's got one of those receivers. So we still sound like like that, like old time AM radio. We're kicking it old style. We're middle digital. Is that a middle digital? Yeah. So what's the story on that two stone you got? We want to encourage my head to go over to the address. I think it's a bad threat. I'm going to use it. I'm going to take it home and use it for Halloween. What is it? It's a tombstone. It's a motion activated tombstone and when you move in front of it. It makes sounds. Yeah. I think it would be just in the right spot. It goes. It's like that. Come on. Do you QAM hello? Now we can get her done. Not that the nation. Yeah. There you go. Hey, in center of brain surgeon. Why do you want to go with your money on that pole? All right. We'll go right. See ya. Richard Penny. Yeah. Gold is a nice. And so are the one race car drivers. If golfers are athletes and so are race car drivers. I got news for him and race car drivers are a hell of a lot more athletic than golfers. Even guys that play bad mid and are more athletic than golfers. Soccer players. When we got paleo on there. But just about any sporting type activity or game. You can think of even guys that play monopoly. I think are more athletic than golf. Poker. If they have it on ESPN it must be a sport. There you go. Feel like you're. Poker. How many QAM hello? Are you doing? Pretty good, pal. I got one for you. This is from here. From here. Or you could beat up a white person. But you couldn't date one. Check. Jack. All right. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot, pal. We'll see you in the good old runs. We're just hanging. Wow. 5.670. 5.6. We get a lot of, we'll get 50,000 names on here. Let's put every athlete. How about Joe Peppetone? What about, uh, I was trying to figure out a obscure name that I hit, uh, how about Jerry Lumpy enormous seabroon? Huh? How about Gus Zerniel? How about, uh, there was a baseball player named Zeeke and I can't think of what his last name was he played either for the Washington Center. I think for the Washington Center is Zeeke. Although I was Gus Zerniel's nickname Zeeke, but there was actually a guy named Zeeke. Somebody will know. And Josh will say, oh, yeah, I remember that. 5.670. You've got to bone up on this stuff. Man, because someday you might get to like, I'm one of those shows all the way down. It's like on jeopardy. And you can pick ancient the jocks from the dark ages, you know, every, uh, Bob Musil from 1927, the Ankees speaking in 27. The World Champion, 27 Ankees. That's the year that the baby roof hit 60 home runs by the way. 1927, you know that? Uh, I didn't know you know it. See? Not even on a clock in. You're learning fantastic and graphical stuff here that someday might make you a lot of money, but I really doubt it. WCWM, hello. Hey, New. Yes, sir. I'm doing an out-torn between that great pool and Gump 4. That's a test spot to me in. You don't have to choose. We'll put them both on there. All right, let me do it. Mark Cranfield, those are the horrible myths back in the days when the myths were really a joke. I'll look quite frankly nowadays again. And Gump 4 is Lee. WR, W-O-R, SL-E-Y. In fact, he had a radio station's college. There's one of the first few letters of the Gumpers name. Gump 4 is Lee. And Ed Cranfield. And Cranfield. How about Eddie Jackman? Those are the kind of hockey players that me photoshoot about like in the distant past. That's me, Phos hockey knowledge. Ed Cranfield's Ed, the Jacumen and Gump 4 is Lee. How about Eddie Jack? What do you say? What do you think? How about Gora? Here's one for serious Gordy How. H-O-W-E. How now Brown? So? That's what they say to Oprah. What do you think? Gordy How? Okay. Now please don't tell me you never heard a Gordy How Josh. I have. Jesus. Oh, okay. What? Yeah, he's heard about Jesus. He was over there typing. You know, the mics. Yeah, he would know Gordy How from how he and Lorenz. For Johnny Dolans. Anyway, let me say it again as a warning. As a public service to the audience, if the movie, the anniversary party comes to a cable network near you or if anybody offers you to set you or loan you or just give you the DVD. Just say fat and throw back at him. Do not watch it. It highly touted again a piece of garbage. That's not an opinion. That's a fact. It is morbid. It's depressing. It doesn't go anywhere. It just goes on much, much too long. Nearly two hours of crap. And guess what? The dog comes back home in the end. Oh, boy. Somebody had a happy ending. Yeah. No, it did not. That's why all this other tourists was going on inside and the dog comes back and he sniffed around like, you know. And then the credits come on and you say, that's it. That's what I wasted almost two hours of my, well, actually two and a half hours of the commercials of my life on this. I'm going to say. He's a garbage. Yeah, it was on some, uh, one of those where they have commercials. You know, like I have these got commercials. Although it was not, I see they would never show anything that bad. Anyway, here's a future post suggestion, but I know we've done this many times. If I could get that lot of software I would live in. Then it's got New York. I mean, we've done that, right? Yes, we have appreciate all the post suggestions. It's not that we've done before. And we've, and the one we're doing today was never done before. Believe me, we've done your favorite software athlete, but never done just like to narrow it.

She's in Trilmick, host the open mic porch tonight at the grounds for divorce coffee house. It gives him something to do, you know, since the record stuff selling and the group he stopped polishing his knob. Every rose has its thorn, and in much the same way every night has its dawn. But it's not forget that it is also analogous to the notion that every cowboy sings a sad sad song. That expert on by the guy from poison, other hard rock acts have hit the coffee house circus. Like the guy from quiet riot, come on and fiel the noise. And once you have felt the noise, now would be the time if you were a girl to proceed with rocking your boys. What we do in this instance is get wild, wild, wild. What some metalists have found the transition difficult, they just rocked too hard for the coffee house circus. As evidence by the guy from Iron Maiden. Oh God. poison. Their transition into spoken word poetry readings is inspiring. If by inspiring you mean pathetic.

The shortages that Perdue feared never materialized largely because reader proved less damaging to go to the Gulf Coast we find was initially expected. Parents learned to the governor's decision-made Friday afternoon. Many families had a scramble over the weekend to make ardent arrangements for the children. Two mothers brought their great schoolers to the capital on Monday for a teaching on the steps. Just yards from Perdue's office. It's certainly caused a lot of problems for working parents. They had causes problems for these kids. They need to be learning and access hang in the out watching the cartoon network at home. Said mother Randy David of suburban Atlanta. Randy David no can do.

There's some things that I wish that I would have done differently. You know, the old story about the cover being bare from the standpoint. You were basically kind of similar starting from scratch. And in two years after we can get into the playoffs, then we've got to have a $25 dollar salary debt perk. And I can pay you that that probably one single thing destroyed all the credibility that you have as a coach in the locker room. We got with the hammer. We did it. We did it.

You're noisy, you're Eeakling. You're simply. You're fair. Reed and Bates. The red tide blue Man has played the Southwest load of course for most of the years. Chasing away tourists this fall. Business owners and tourism officials have ridden him. What a tough man, Drard. The toxic algae has left loads of snowy dead fishes on beaches. hard for people to breathe. It's prompted early checkouts and cancellations that hotels and tourist hotspots such as Anna Maria Island near Bratanton and Santa Belon kept Tiva Islands off board Myers. Well like I said, Cullton and Dred. And we'll teach all those going to go over there to the stupid islands, right? Right. Veech businesses business owners are concerned that could reduce their tourist traffic as they gear for the busy winter season. This is definitely a bad thing since the green steam. Aha! Executive director of the Santa Belon kept Tiva Island Stamber Comers. Like I said, but September's traditionally a light month for occupancy. If the red tide continues to the season, it could mean economic ruin. Ruin! How do you like that? At Bratanton Beach on Annemory Island Lynn Johnson, who owns funnets, sun pericels, said the stench has been almost unbearable. Just like the QM studios there. Saturday we came to work and the beach in the bay were just filled with dead fish. He said every kind of fish, eels, blowfish, groupar. They've laid their dead for three days. You could walk on it. You wouldn't believe the stench. Mary Ann Bratman executive director of Annemory Island chamber Comers. She's received complaints from tourists. We hear visitors saying, what is that? Why can't I breathe? So it's causing a sudden risk. The West Coast is Florida. What do you put here for a long time? Stinks over there. Am I right? I haven't been there long time. I don't say, with or without the fish. I'm not talking about the fish. Forget about the... I'm not talking about a Roma. I'm talking about ambiance. It stinks. And of course the beesleys being over there. I think, oh, there's general Myers. Okay, but a beep. But I'm up here. Right. Keep lying. Baby keep lying. Decided you want to give an activity for forces. Law enforcement authority. Yeah, there you go. Oh, he's seen that I even talking about a rack. They're talking about putting the military, which they should have done. And the first place is bringing the military in. The ten members of the troops that aren't in Iraq. Am I right or what? Well, yeah. When you got, when you have a major catastrophe happening, you've called it in the military. You call it every available body is what you do. And I still wonder how those connect guys under those rock and idiot mountains. How they got their first before the animal cool authorities. They probably want. God, all mighty. W to Q a M. Hello.

And we're proud of him. Somebody QAM. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I think we're talking about giving active duty. People, uh, police powers. But I started about defending military.

Because once that, a stop will comes in there. We're all going to be a walk in very, very strange. Even stranger than some of us already do. You're going to be goose stepping. We're here.

Now, friend Ray Hudson would be proud to hear that. In fact, that old toad, oh, I should have mentioned this to Hank this one, that old toad, Sarny. He wrote a column yesterday about the greatest stuff he ever covered was the Florida strikers. The Florida strikers, okay? The Marlins of one, two world series, the dolphins had back to back Super Bowl victories, included the undefeated season. And the most, the most stimulating worthwhile thing he's covered was the freaking Florida strikers, uh, strikers, psychor, uh, soccer crab. You ready for that? No? He is such a toad. Oh, here we go.

We're doing a pants before you will. Now, this is some of the most ridiculous news I have ever heard. The ultimate, the dumbing down of America, if you like him as benefior, you'll love him as Benador. It says her in Washington Post. Yeah, I guess it's being touted is the next senator from Virginia. Let me give you one clue. Do fairy. Okay. Does that narrower down? Well, Ben, that's the hot new idea being tossed around by Virginia Democrats, where desperately searching for a big name that challenged the re-lustion bid of rising to GOP star, Senator George Allen next year, now that outgoing governor Mark Warner is ducked out, why who should it happen to be pondering a move to Thomas Jefferson County, but a certain square jawed medium maggot with a taste for liberal politics and millions than Affleck, the star of Jimmy in the J. L. T. Romance and all sorts of herbal movies happily settled with any of the star Jennifer Garner. Anybody buy that? No. I think maybe he was settled with Earl Stanley Garner. You were talking about the first child. Do you see that they're expecting their first child? Does that prove it to you? Okay, whatever. Have been shopping for real estate around Charlottesville. British tablets claim it's a done deal. And let's see, the Washington Post is will only go so far as to report that they checked out at least one country estate a few weeks ago. It was about that time that party officials started batting Affleck's name around. It's spread pretty widely, at least in the political underground, University of Professor of Virginia Professor Larry Savato, kind of a name is Andrew Larry Saturday. Sure, what a Virginia spirit punted told Michael is sure the post Richmond correspondent. That would be like Dwight Loderdale, like Placidodamingo. Right. Another name on a wish list, Blockbuster Legal Solar writer John Grisham, but the central Virginia Farmhouse owner who gave generously Democrats to the stimulus to be legislature has brushed off past the overtures and truth that Democrats are less concerned with beating Ellen and slowing him down. Both he and Warner are in the 2008 presidential race. How do you like that? Benifer. Benifer. But he's very down making babies. Oh yeah, we believe that. Hey Ben. You're fairies. Maybe he's making babies with town crews. They're working on it. The bigger issue besides his sexuality, whatever that might be. The fact that he has no talent. Yeah, and he's just a dollar boy. Yeah. I would suggest all of these things. We got how many votes have we got 980 something now? 885. Well, we're certainly going to go past 900 days, which is good because you know, a lot of people aren't going to vote because it's sports and they're just not going to say, well, we don't like sports. They won't even make the effort to do that. Or maybe their favorite athlete is not here because you were you and our talking too much. Well, let's stop that. Well, okay. Well, let's take a whole bunch of calls between now and four o'clock. WDQA, I'm the famous line nine. Hello. Yeah. I'll talk to the corner about a see if Neil saw that. Think about Michael Brown. The congress. Do I see it? I see it. Yeah, man. See and run away from all those. Where he's at? It's everybody else's fault. Right. It's all the local politicians. He didn't have nothing to do with that. They have a string. His ass up is what they ought to do. It's gone. Amen. Nice call, Pally. In fact, we want to apologize to all the real scholar of the world because he's lower than that on the human food chain and the subhuman food chain old Brownie. Today's guy is down there making a $32,000 now. No one is in double pay a $32,000 an hour before the storm. So now is the time for the people to go back and make some of that money.

We didn't tell me what I said in the knowledge and what I think. Tell me to cue a M. Hello. See Neil, you forgot one for the poll. But we're trying to figure out about 500. What are you got?

Pick an ass. How you doing, Chris? You invested. You silly person. See, I shouldn't know right off the bat when the books are came to me one time at a game and says to me, uh, oh, Chris Moore, I told him what a piece of crappy was. Oh, he, uh, you know, he's doing an NHL hockey. He used to do the New Jersey Devils. I said, so what does that prove? I said, there are a lot of horrible people doing play by play. What does that prove? I don't know. That's the most of your close personal friend Josh. I understand that you are like kind of like of falling in different directions. What does that mean? I don't know. You're having a falling out. There's that you and Roxy or you and, uh, let me ask you this since this is the last week of the Marlin season. Obviously, these are the last few games that you have a little hideous for several months. Uh, is Rich Walsh going to be coming back and doing the games on TV again next year. We can only pray the answer is no, we pray. Please, please come to your senses. No, he should become that. Why? I don't know. I mean, I haven't heard any. What do he should be coming back? Well, I have heard. Oh, I've faced on talent based on the fact that Jim Sarnis got his head up his ass. Based on the fact that very jackasses afraid to really ripen the as he deserves. He is unqualified. You know that he's pathetic. He is pathetic. He makes the event boring sound like Mel Allen like like a combination of Bob Prince Malale and Harry Kerry all rolled into one ritual. He sounds like a little like I've out of trouble. You're old kid with a microphone singing on basement somewhere with a old web court tape recorder pretending to be a very baseball broadcaster. He's awful. He is totally, in fact he's like them brownie of the South Florida. He's like Michael Brown. He is unqualified. Be a qualified. Or something. I know you got another week of hanging around with those guys. You just have to continue to keep in mind. What's the season's over there? You can ripen a nest. 5 6 7 0 5. Unless you really think he's doing a hell of a good job. I really don't know. I don't want to pull words in your mouth because I know you ripped Jimmy Siffle is real bad. Well, does that really exactly just like which walls. How many Q a and hello? Hello. Yes. I want for the poll. Okay. What is where me? Go ahead and say it. Just my homin. No. My homin.

Listen, I know it's a little late in the show but I was wanting if I could make a request. Yeah. You play that with Paul Harvey where he's selling the joke about the two guys in the farm. No problem. The widow. All right. The two guys in the farm with a widow. You know when he's talking about? Yes. The widow joke. Good morning Americans. It's Paul Harvey. Stand by for news. Jack decides to go skiing with his buddy Bob. They load up Jack station wagon and head north after driving a few hours. They get caught in a terrible blizzard. They pull into a nearby farmhouse and ask the attractive lady of the house if they can spend the night. Well, I'm recently widow. She explains that I'm afraid the neighbors would talk if I let you stay in the house. Not to worry Jack says we'll be happy to sleep in the barn. Well, nine months later, Jack gets a letter from the widows attorney. He calls this friend Bob and says, do you remember that good lookings with Oh, what the farm we stayed at? Well, yes, I do. Well, did you happen to get up in the middle of the night go into the house and make love to her? Yes, I have to admit I did. Well, did you happen to use my name instead of telling her your name? Bob's face turns red. And he says he has some afraid I did to which Jack says well, thanks a lot. Tell Jack says she just died of left me your farm. Paul Harvey. Good. Hey, this is Neil Rogers. This is five 16. Good. It's payment. Uh, it's out. No, it's not out. It's not good. Oh, yeah. Is this thing on it? Smack it. It's definitely done. We can. Oh, wait, wait, wait. See.

Wow, have financial. God was in Iraq. He's a funding for their levies. Looters called saying, and are keen. In a room where we made a bigger deal. In search for Natalie Hallaway. One white girl we trained away. I'm even as for help from the name he seems. I'm tired of it. George Bush was a case to name in Crawford. I guess that's here though. Be no Marty. Girls don't wild me. The city of New Orleans. Or the half-Joseph and their fellow Kudos Bar with us. My number 19 votes and I'd pull and our buddy Wayne. Remember Wayne from the Apache days of WIO D for us. Wayne wants to live in with George or Josh. What he's saying he came with me because he can't afford to get up here plus I don't want him. But he says, where about Barry Sanders for the full for Christ's sakes. And he's still looking for a place to hang out. Everybody wanted to move in with me and hang out for him. And here it is how many years later now. I might still have a border all these years later. I don't want you to take it personally Wayne because the answer was no then and was still being on our J.C. Who was at I.O.D. in O.C. and they said he wanted to move in with me. I wanted it. The answer would have been yes. But that's another story. Remember J.C. I wanted it. And what about J.P. What about it? But the hair. And then he was a hairy one. Oh that's okay. I don't really look at him. Yeah. Oh, he's gone. He's gone. Actually he called me left the message one time. He was sucking around. I forget that. I didn't return the call. He was often school somewhere. He'd relayed or someplace like that. Yeah. But Wayne is still around. That's interesting. Let's get very sad. He's on the right away for Wayne. And Josh has no problem. You can move with him with him in a new place. Now I'm good. No. What about George? I think you're part. Wayne needs a place to stay. Oh Wayne. How the special place for him. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Really? Ha ha ha. Right here. Oh, back to him. Here's why not again. Q.A.M. And you know, I got good song about weed man. How does that Okay. Okay. Send it into us. Dominic, you way. I'm hello. Put it in the container. Put it in the intercoastal and slow to down to us. Q.A.M. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Speaking. Yeah. I want to. You're pole today. Okay. Let's go back to George Michael. George. I'm liking. He just liked that to learn what he means. Give it. He just died not that long ago. Oh, not too long ago. Yeah. I love your sharp body. Thanks a lot, pal. George Michael. What are you? I'm going to slow to what there was in the name of that team. I should ask him the old Minnesota emojis. The basketball player. He was a great bass George Michael. He was a great and we can probably also put Cliff Hagan and Bob headed on there and people like that. And then for people from Rochester we could but aren't he rising in Bobby Wanzer. I'm just kidding about those by the way. But George Michael belongs on there. Not the Minnesota timbre walls, but way way way back then when they originally had their first team. I was in the name of that. In fact, Google George Michael. And in the MRAK A and plays Josh. He's Googled it and see what it sees. What the name of that team was. I can't believe I can't remember that. I'm sure that's who it was. WQAM. Hello. Hey, get to the meal. Speaking. Meal. What's up, pal? How are you doing, pal? Good. I got two requests. Uh-huh. Can you play that one bit where the guy calls in about most care piece? Okay. And, can I call from the interview, Craig? Ah. I hit it four times there. Well, you can't say D-bag anymore, sir. We just had a joy, sir. Right. We can't say D-bag. It's in D-we can say it's in D-bag. Okay. We say that. And we can also say the doctor that performed the surgery on J.C. Listum. Didn't he the same doctor that performed the procedure on your Q.P.? The doctor who performed the surgery. Let's take a bite. What's your thing? Why? Maybe the doctor? No. I don't know where you've enjoyed Call-o. I'm not sure. I'm not sure where you're going. I'm not sure where you went. Are you going to Holy Cross? I'm not sure. Well, bottom line is that doctors can't tell how long they're going to be at. No, you're not sure. Somewhere at least a month could be up to eight weeks. Somewhere there. Wally a little over your Q.M. Yeah. When a guilty left that little smirk of going there, it's like, I think that was the beginning of the end for those two. That was when he started being on the outside of a whole deal. And anyway, five six seven. We're going to a few more names on here. It's said that we don't have. I'm every athlete who ever played on here. There's so many great ones. You know what we left off? But again, it's your favorite. How about Bob Poozy? Co-USY? Bob Poozy? Oh, he's a Celtic fan, huh? I mean, if we got, what's his name on here? Who else do we? What are the basketball beside Michael? You got Larry Bird on there? Larry Bird on there. If we got the abnoxious Larry Bird on there, and certainly Bob Poozy, who, by the way, cannot speak. Have you ever heard Bob Poozy talk? Yeah, it's not good. He does the collar on the shoulder. I mean, how speak to that? I mean, some people would call an accident or an affectation. I just say cannot speak. Bob Poozy, which makes him perfect, just like many martes to be on the way to you. This is Neil Rogers. This is 5168. They play like men, and they look like women. And shut the sack with all the same game. Hangin' out in travel town, so. Sixth and fifths, oh, where the sun will still win. In the jungle, the fire, my heart. Here we go. Memorize again. But never season, but still count on fame. You can't be challenging for how you let see him fill in both. If you grab it to me, it's a promise of I'm a strike off the West. Where the game is going, I'm a better high-end. Yeah. As a girl in the downfall and fire fire, all of their dreams in the wind. And I can't believe it. Wonder who will I put our left in our time. And I'll say, oh, there's a crumb that she'll be by. You survived. Okay, so I'm gonna say Minneapolis Lakers am I right? I didn't look at them. Yes. Yeah. The Lakers were before the night. I mean, I didn't play for the Lakers. I didn't know where Minneapolis Lakers before we were before anybody was born. Except me, I was born. But anyway, that's to deal with George Micah. When we asked today, who is your all-time favorite athlete? And I'm sure we can add like thousands more on here. Like all for crying out loud. Bobby Richardson and Gilmig do Gold and Tony Kubak and Joe Peppetone and Joe Collins and any Robinson and all the other Yankees. So that's just one team. And Darrell, Sittler and Frank Mahabalich and Baby Keon and George Armstrong. That's just one hockey team, right? Okay. But anyway. What is Pavel Burig on here? He's just, he's still got a small pair. What I heard. He's still got that team. He's here. That goes to, I don't care about all these other votes on there. But that has to tell you right there about some footage. It's just, it's so depressing. It just makes you weak. Another reason I'm just, I'm kissing the table here. I'm kissing the table here. I'm kissing the table here. I'm kissing the ground. I'm kissing the table too. Just the fact that I'm not there. Well, let's do it. You made a lot of money. You know something that's great. That's all well and good. People support of the show over the years. And thank you so much. And we hope you continue doing it. But I, I'm telling you right now, it went and down. Get that hell out. If you're fat, you're a sanity in your life. Right on. Get out. In fact, George is just counting the days until he wins the lot of were something. Something. To Boca Brian loans him about five minutes. So we can get that out of there. And of course, Josh, I mean, you know, he'll go over to Marlon's taken. Who is your all-time favorite athlete? Dan Marwina, 197. Nobody even close. In a league of his own, Danny Boy. He's 4139, almost 15% of the audience. Just see, even if I hated sports, which I don't, but if I did, I know there would have to be somebody that I would like or admire you. I'll think that. Right? Okay. No. Michael Jordan 58, Mickey Manel 57, Muhammad Ali 56, you see how close those three are the side by each. There are no is to know is Mickey is fall little behind though. They've released 33, Journey 25. All right. I think we have to get journey on every pull now. Will he make these 25? Bobby or 23. Best hockey player who ever lived. Shack 20. Swing. Wayne Gretzki 19, Larry Bourd 18, Lance Armstrong, from 16, Palea 13, Madball 13. All right. Robert Talklombetti 13, Magic Johnson 13, Tom Brady. Just moved into Danny's uniform number 13. OJ's got 12. How's that? Bob Greasy 11, Tiger Woods 11, Mirio Lemue 10. Jimmy Brown 8, Geogi Barra 8, Larry Zonka 7. He's still alive. He's hanging on, Jack Nicholson, Luke Geragon, waterpain and Dick Buckress 6 of piece. Dick Focus. Outcale and Greedless in his drone name with Jeff Gordon 5 of piece. Hulk Hogan 4 John Hogan don't have any. Johnny and I this Cal Rift in John L. Wayne Mark Spitz 10 with Jim Jackie Robinson Johnny Barra 4 piece. Three of piece for Laura L.T. Thurmond Munson, Joe to measure any bank's move pouch and Thorp Lilaw's Ato Billy Smith 2 of piece for Anne Cordoja, Gordie Howe, Gunporesley, Pump out Barry 2. What a joke. Jesse O'L and Sugar Ray Leonard, Mike Tyson and Barry bonds 2 of piece. And the rest of the story, Solamente Uno or Settle. Oh, the big, ah, for all these others. Well, some of them just went on their like Bob Coosie. Bob Coosie, he sounds like a younger, slightly younger, uh, don't I'm a, and slightly more coherent. Namaste just ever so slightly. That's very, very, very. That's very cool. Here at our good close personal buddy, the moment come on next. We got the mad dog at four. The Marlins. Anybody remember them? Six thirty pregame tonight. Bye bye.
