Before any paper had a collection of quotes from him over the years on various subjects. They were quite entertaining. Yeah. You know what the first one was? Sure. What was it? I'm dying out of the hands. Hold on, sir. I would like to. Okay. Do you believe he's an automa? I guess so. If he said so, who the hell are we to argue? Mobile on the turnpark that's got to be gone by now, right? No, here. Well, fantastic. I got to go ahead. How you doing Neil? Well, I'm not sure. I think we're making a slow comeback. I hope so.

I don't know why. Oh, D. We have an opening in date County, but you're going to have to move like the wind to get in. That's obvious. 751, WIOD. Let's go to, um, uh, come on. I don't want it. I don't want to do over and under and in. And I'll get out of here with a chip to sure. Don't ever put those on. Those are the most awful calls. And you can't understand them.

But if you really want to corner the market, if you want every share. I don't want to corner the market. I want out of the market soon. Like, by two o'clock. I want out. I was thinking you should do your show by Langley to a Spanish show and an English show. Right. That's just what we need. Another Spanish language station, sir. Don't you realize that you've heard that this, what do they call it? Or a simulation. That's what's going to happen. Everybody's going to be assimilated and no time at all all the Spanish language stations will be gone. That's why we have 47 of them now. But think of it, Neil. Neil and Espania.
