Summer 1990 is the summer of Dick Tracy. You'll see the movie. Listen to the soundtrack. Wear the T-shirt and read the comic book. And now, just in time for Father's Day, you can enjoy the fragrance that was inspired by the movie, the soundtrack, the T-shirt and the comic book. New Dick Tracy Colone. Why smell like other guys? Now you can smell like Dick. And over yet tonight's the Big Night, down at San Susie's with Rick and Clust from 8 to midnight. Rick and Clust and Dick. It's 10 16 to WIOD. Let's take a call in Boko. Yeah. How you doing? OK. Don't want to come on. Do you have you here? Friend of mine. Well, don't worry. You're not. The while I'm 220 out of no if that can't. Friend of mine just got to job as a political cartoonist. First cartoon he did was a, well, what was about flag burning? I wanted to let you know about it. It's split into two or two different sides of the panel. The first side shows an American hippie, so to speak, burning the American flag. You considered communist anti-American and tri-patriot. The second half is a picture of a Chinese student burning the Chinese flag. Now he's considered a patriot. Yeah. Defender. Yeah. What we're gnashing our teeth and didn't we cut off relations with China until George discovered a wasn't such a good idea? Exactly. Because they were doing that because they were attacking all those kids and shooting him and taking away the right of free descent. You see the problem in this country is lack of education. I mean, most people in this country, the farther they can go, is the Stimsyns and Murray Tyler Moore. And that's about the extent of their mentality. So don't confuse them with a constant twist. They don't even know what it means. Right. They think that the first amendment means that anything is OK as long as they approve it. And anything they don't like should be banned. They don't like it. That's America. OK. I mean, this I got to be honest with you. This is a pretty second rate country. The name what he used to be. OK. It's pretty embarrassing. Right. I really mean that. It's a second rate embarrassing country. Exactly. And you're so excited about it. You're up there laughing. They think we're like a laughing stock word joke. Right. We look at each and you're up going, oh, it's great. Everybody's going to be able to say what they want to say and do what they want to do. But not here. Exactly. But you have to move to Yugoslavia. Right. Exactly. Right. You know, this whole two-light crew thing. After playing in your home, what happened there? Can the police come to your door? That'll be next. When Sheriff Nick sticks his head in the door to stop slipping around the city of violated that ordinance. You're going through your CD collection. So somebody ought to walk up the chair of Nick and say, oh, by the way, Nick. Sheriff, Steve. Steve. Yes, that's ICK. Steve. Yes, that's for sure. Sir. That is not Steve. Pigs. Whispering is there, Nick. I'm thinking about who that crew is. You don't understand that the app hours and Broward, because they're just going, they haven't a field. They now, they would love dearly to go back to the days. I don't know how long you've been here. But years ago, Broward was noted, people ran there. They didn't want Jews. They didn't want blacks. They certainly didn't want Hispanics. The good boy. Of course, it's ironic that Nick, I guess he thinks he's the token tube and for all a Broward County. So he's okay, but nobody else has permitted. Because basically, that's where this mentality comes from. Right. Try to clean up, right? Even in a locus colony, they never saw so many wasps. Okay, that's how I'm verse. They're trying to get all the undesirables. That's correct. And who did that? Who did that for? Clue. Most of us have a great day. Thank you, sir. What the hell are we getting serious now? See, we had such a good time, especially yesterday. Life is great, everything's wonderful. And now I feel like I'm going to start expanding all this energy again and get sick for nothing. It's not worth it. Because nobody gives a crap. Okay, they're all in their own little stupid lives and they're too ignorant to understand what the hell these things make. Oh, gee, you can't burn the flag. That's unpatriotic. That's how Bush got in the first place. Running around all the flag companies, holding waving the flag, you know, with Martha Washington standing next to him with the white wig, for Betsy Ross, where would it help she is? That's not his wife. That's Betsy Ross. Palm Beach. Dale. Yeah. Unbelievable. Yes. I think I'm not going to change. You know what's going to happen? Yeah. I mean, I shunned it. What? They sell those dice dice and they're not there. Yeah. He's white. He's white. What is that? What are they talking about? They got pulled out. Well, William Constable was on this morning. I can't mention the other person he was on with on the CBS morning news, so you can use your own imagination. But William Constable was on there. And he put it right on the money. Nothing should be obscene. Okay? Nothing should be obscene. As far as adults are concerned, I mean, yeah. What's going to be next? You can't go into a bookstore and buy lady chatter, leaves lover or the tropical cancer or patent places. That's going to be next. Because they're full of all those words. I mean, everyone, I'm interestingly enough, it was the guy from the focus on the family who ordered all the four letter words on Donnie who this morning. And the show aired yesterday afternoon live and a half a dozen made your markets all over the country. Yeah. And we'll make them a college. No, it's not okay. And Phil made it a college. I've made an ass out of them later in the show because here he's attacking all these other musicians. And he's the one who had the audacity would not have any idea. And many millions of people I watched in life, he had to be compelled to use all of these four letter words, including the effort on national TV. Very nice. Very nice. Well, I do. What if I say do you brag right away? They're having a nervous breakdown. Right? What about the holidays, hypocrites kidding, huh? Look in their own closets, man. That's where you'll find all those skeletons right in their own closets. And look, what's our Texas hot front of Van Wagon? I say your Texas connection. Who's the next state hotline? Where you get Texas fluency, Anna? Alabama. Mississippi, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Missouri. Don't you understand it's a redneck yon who country where it's a bunch of racist anti-submitted disgusting pigs. That's what this country is deteriorated into, okay? Well, I say it's certainly not a good thing. That's a good thing. I have a nice day. Hmm? Twenty-two after ten, I think we cut them short there. Well, I don't want to get hysterical about this. Is it worth getting my blood pressure up again? No. This is what I did for 12 years and what the hell they're giving me. I mean, it's stroke. What the hell is your go to a accomplish? Getting all these people hysterical. I can't get up. I can't get up. I can't get up. Open that window. Crank it up. His loud is a little go, okay? Even in the house. Maybe there's somebody in your house and bust your ass, okay? If anybody with a brown shirt comes your door today. Lots of doors and don't call it police. Why don't I have to take issue there. See, when he starts him with our senior hall, I think maybe they got a point. Twenty-three after ten, it's just a joke, Luther. Don't get all hysterical. It's just a little joke. Because basically, I think your music is garbage. But what I think is not important, okay? See, that's the whole issue. That's the whole point. I mean, a lot of people think that all these forms of art are garbage too. And they just use that as an excuse for the bigotry, all right? Everything is subjective. If you don't like it, don't buy it. Don't watch it. Don't listen to it, okay? Simple as that. Attention, came on, Shappens. We have a lost little girl. She's 19 years old. All burn hair. Green eyes. Thirty-six, twenty-four, thirty-four. An answers to the name event. She says she lost her daddy and needs a new one. Will all prospective daddy's please form a double line outside the managed office. And please have a recent bank statement or stock portfolio with you. Thank you. Thank you, Randy. Twenty-seven after ten, it's Wild. Miami. Yeah, Neil. What is this? What is this? I regret to be here. You know, I don't know what I need to say to make it clear to you, okay? We don't make references to him. We went through two years. I went through two and a half years of hell, okay? I'm not going to do it again. Let's somebody else be the great crusader in this community. We are going to talk about him, okay? We can, but we won't. Because we've allowed prudence to take over where emotion used to rule, okay? If you want to grieve, you go deal with him, okay? I don't. And either this management, okay? So it ain't going to happen. Miami. Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. I just want to change this up a little bit. Yes, sir. I just want to go to those mats, huh? You shouldn't bring that up, folks. Okay. I just want to say that both of those teams really bite the big one. Let's be honest about it. Oh, no, no. Next topic. Okay. I just want to say a real short call. Yeah, I'm telling you. That's good. I know you're in specs and you should keep the good work up. You look fine. I'm doing pretty good. I'm doing great. You look fine, taster. Well, I wouldn't go that far. Oh, really? It's all relative. You're pretty interesting crowd on there. Yes, they're good crowd. So I think I wonder how many came for the food and how many came for Gilbert. That's the problem. Well, that's probably true. I just want to let you know you do a good job and keep up the good work and you look great. Thank you, sir. Okay. Have a good bye. 29 past 10 at Wild. Your friendly station for the 90s. We have an open line in date. Wild. I'm looking forward to seeing Dick tomorrow. Pulled on. No, that's tonight. Wild. Neil.

And I turned off. Real out. But my way down. Yeah. Away from. You. You. All right. What is that tell you? That's going to be their anti-racist comment. It's exactly. I couldn't have said it. I agree with you. Speak. No, Vado sir. That's it with an SS in the beginning. SS I see case. Speak. No, I couldn't believe it. I'm a new step. Come on. You know, it's amazing to me because somebody was. Tell me yesterday at their motor. I don't know if you were listening. But I'm. Radio. Mom. Be one of these hysterical right wing Cuban stations. We haven't date County that the somebody brought my name up the other day. And a commentator started in this big. I'm a man. I'm this a communist. You know, it's amazing that the same people who allegedly came here. These old line old Cubans. The ones who listen to RHC and Cuba and Radio, Mambi. These are the like Nick. They're a thick Nevada. These are the same ones that come here. I want to impose repression on everybody who doesn't agree with them. You know, it's in this big. It's on ever since I can remember the old line right wing Cubans who think. The Tista was great. Fashion is great. Everybody's at the left of the. The Telo. The Honies. The Communist. I mean, it is old and his pondress. Give it a rest. That couldn't believe it. The minute I got my car, you started playing it. And I. I must have went three lights over to get your face. Good. It turned it up. You gave it a finger. Excellent. I can't believe it. Why do you got to impell him. I want his back. No. Okay. I want his belt buckle number. That's right. I want his. And he says 69. You got it man. Good luck, Mr. Crank it up. Crank the window. Crank it up. You're going to play this in its entirety or at least I'm a silver time. We got. I got a lot of you want to just get in the hop in the car just to tool up the highway all over South Florida. And because it's the clean version, they can't hear if they try to name your ass. So the crap out of them. Okay. That's what we need. Right. Little more lawsuits. For playing obscene material in the car. Right. Well, I'm telling you this. This is not this state is not. We ought to have it like a new symbol. Are you going to cut that up for me? It's at least you can do. No. That's the burp one. What? We do. Well, give it a listen. Okay. I mean, we can't play all your material. I notice you've got all lined up there like in a row like we're going to have like a tribute. It's all great. But let's get serious. What was I going to say? Yeah. Let's have a new, uh, mouth and a Yorkie now. You're going to be all right. He's not well. He's just so emotional and hysterical. Just as Johnny Darkey knows it's all a bunch of crap. Johnny Darkey by the way, and the element that we needed to the building. It's called psychosis. That's just what we needed to was Johnny Darkey around here. Let's have somebody make a big map of the state of Florida. Just the outline of it with a big swastika like right in the middle. Like about where Lake Oak and Chobi is. Okay. I think that would be good. I'll let's go to a mobile in Boka. That's gone. Up yours. Carl Springs. Hello. More in Neil. Yes, sir. If you're going to put one of those maps of Florida on there, you better make sure you cover it up. Otherwise it'll probably be deemed. Why are you right? I never thought about that. The phallic element there probably get a lot of people very upset. Very nervous. Especially right between Dayton Palm Beach counties. Oh, Neil. You know, see, he talked about the censorship thing. In the Miami Harrel, or the Wave Hill Harrel in the English edition, on page 1-G below Dave Barry's column. There's a great article. In the Harrel, that's unusual. I know. But it's about devil worship. You know, with these little kids who wanted to put out a place. And you were talking about the first amendment, you know, being an education thing. And I think after you read about maybe the first six pair of asses is article, you're a whole focus will come right into view. I mean, what they call education in this country. My dogs would laugh at, okay? People in this country have no concept of what they, first, remember anything about the law, about the Bill of Rights, about anything. They know nothing. Period. All they know is about MTV and a lot of stupid crap in the Simpsons. And whatever happens to be hot on a given day. And inside of the vision and outside of the vision, and who slept with who. And it's pathetic. And man, we're going to pay a wicked price for it. Okay, keep your passport, Andy, sir. I'm hanging on to it, tightly. I'm hanging on to it, too. Thanks, Neil. See you later, but not too tight. W. Y. O. D. If anybody wants to get a copy of that, recycled records. Yeah, I know. We don't talk to a super day or Mr. Radio or anybody who knows them. W. Y. O. D.

I don't want to seem paranoid, but I'm just taking all precautions. I don't want to be so stupid. Don't go far back. I don't want to be so mad. You just didn't have any. WIOD. Birthday, Richard. Let's go to Lake Worth, hello. Hello. Hi. It's a snail. Yes. Hi, Niel. I'm a person calling. I'm just one. You can't get sick. You have to stay healthy to kind of be in charge of this ridiculous. In charge of what? Oh, just keep in our spirits up against all these crazy people. I guess what I'm calling about. I watched Donna here and got totally absolutely insane. I don't want to talk about it. Okay. All right. You have a good day. Don't you understand? Please, Laura. Can't talk about the one, a knee under the thaw. And that's it. I mean, there's no point in time. That, Donna, who is a show. They're just making a circus out of it. Don't you understand? Dad, I know. You can see them all screaming and carrying on and having an nervous break. They're just making it into a side show like Sally Jessie, like a free show. Well, that's not the point. The point is we're living right here in the middle of it. That's why this state has been transformed into a Nazi Germany. Absolutely. And to make my point is that the one thing I can't remember, he's saying that things about suicide. I'm very much for it. Let's get with this. This is real stuff. I had a son that committed suicide. Let's keep brushing all this under the rug and keeps seeing a Mary pop and songs. Let's get real about what's happening with slides. And I have a son that's a punk rock singer. And I'm for, you know, this is real stuff folks. You can walk around and put on your little church hat and I got nothing to happen. But there's some real stuff out there. If people want to get real, okay, if you don't. Well, in the world of Reagan and Bush, we don't, we just say, don't say no to drugs. Just say no to drugs. Just say no to the, just say no to everything bad into the tooth fairy and all of a sudden, everything will be just fine. It's somebody used to say everything will be just fine. That's why we need you to stay well so we can at least. Well, I'm here to have a good time. I'm not going to be, I'm not going back to that stuff anymore. We just forget that. No way. No way. Hang in there. Okay. I'm hanging. She let me ask you this. I want to give you a hypothetical situation. You're in your convertible. You're much tank convertible at a stop light. Okay. And it's a bomb. It kind of an a breezy day and maybe they're these old parts sitting next to you and their big, continental or their big civil and maybe they got to window cracked open because they too cheap to run the air conditioning. Okay. And you and your friends are having an animated heated argument. And one of you others, a few F words. And another one says the SA toward and they're feeling like a bunch of ex-livers come on. What's the difference? Are they going to rest you for that now? Public obscenity by uttering words. You see, this is the war. You remember the movie The War of the Worlds. Now we have the war of the words. The dirty words. Okay. This is so juvenile and so childish. It's pathetic. Pathetic. My amy. No, they haven't been in the hour. I wish they'd be. Yeah, I know. That's bad hold. Not radio stroke. Sure. Whatever you want to hold. Briefly. Oh, the locker. Good morning, sir. What is this? Good. Come on. Come on. Yeah. I think. I can smell one a mile away, sir. I can smell a Tommy Pinkle Pig a mile away. I think, sir. S.S. really got the grab headlines of press coverage. He's got the self promoting fool, sir. He's got self promoting jackass. Yes, I do. I remember when he ruined that drug bust because they put it on national team. I had to throw the case out of court. And then, of course, when he was going to put the tents up in the federal judge threatened to throw his stupid ass in jail. And he had a back down on it. He's nothing but a publicity grabbing jackass. Okay. I don't like your joke. I don't like your note. Yes. Facebook. I'm like, I say. Your comes fan. They both suck. But I love the game. Why do two? That's worth about. I didn't love it too much. So yesterday. Because I got home and it was still ahead. I got home just in time when it was starting to get the crappy out of the Senate. The Senate. The first game. I know. It was pretty grim. That is. But still, it's the game is great. It's the institution. The only thing worse than watching the way we're pitching is any of the Harry made a good point yesterday. We got Sandberg and Dawson and Dunston are having like career years. I mean, they're just going crazy. And it's all you might as well throw it down the toe. Because here in the score, six, seven, eight, ten runs a game. And you still can't win a game. You've got a problem. And it's called a bunch of minorly little league pitchers. Five here. What I play with as younger is we get out there and get a good hit. Get all the way around a third. And then everybody strikes. Yeah, that's right. That's the way to do it. It's like they've part standing there on third base. Tell me. Tell me. Oh, okay. Now better luck to us all. Take care. How do you guess? Ten, forty, seven at Wild. We'd be doing it today. I'll tell you that. Let's go to Hallendale. Hello. Hey. You know, it's not, man. Thinking your fastest places. Let's go to Hallendale. Yeah. I'm out here torture in the old. You know, run them on now. Good. So I think we should just nuk the church ladies. And move to Australia. How about it? Okay. All right. We'll go down under. Can we say that? Yeah. Okay. We'll talk you later. I bet. That's what I'm afraid of. Ten, forty, seven. I think still. Well, that was a long 30 seconds. And we have an open line in Hallendale. And another. And you know, it's the interesting thing. We were at the remote. It's special yesterday, which is down in South. Day. And I'm not. I'm not forgetting. A lot of the problems in Dave County. However, I will say this. Having lived in Broward now for about the last five or six years. You look at all the division in Dave County and all this right wing hysterical. Come on. He's still all this crap that's going on. And now, Dave County, they'll look so bad. You know, all those well-closed middle class, middle upper class, reasonably intelligent people that were at the remote yesterday, like with an IQ of over a hundred or at least over twenty. And Broward, in the meantime, is beginning to look worse by the minutes. And now the people in Dave, the worm had what goes around come through around. The people in Dave are like holding their sides with laughter. Look at those faces. Page, look at those. They're all moved out of Dave to get away from it. And now there are a thousand times worse than it ever was in Dave County, Kamenista. It's 11.2 a noon at W.A. until noon, boy. God, this show is moving like lightning. Isn't it? I did that yesterday too. I think that's called swishful thinking. 11.11. We struck an actual here at W.A. O'Ding, you'll struck an actual, 1053. If we can divert for just a second here, I have a shocking bullet in the pass along following a brief stint at W.A. O'D. Miami former KITS San Francisco AM driver, Alex Bennett. We've heard the mornings at the New Rock Station one day, it's you know 11. At a boy, Alex, he's banged. We're able to. There's somebody in the lab. There's just somebody in the lab. There's just somebody in the lab. There's somebody in the lab. The Bay Area will never be the same. Let's go to Miami. Hello? Oh. Yeah. And the last two years. Have you? The things that you know, the things that happen in Georgia and that you went to. Yeah, that's right. They were doing it. And you know, the jail. You legal position, sir. Bad, but. That's right. She's the fashion. She's the fashion. Okay. From the Joseph Grable. I'm going to birthday party in Sheetshutog. Because it was noise is too loud. How about this nine year old kid that got arrested the other day for having a fish fight with a kid in the school yard? How about that? I'm telling you, hey, everybody's getting busted. We're just going to take all of my Senate building weapons. We're just because the Soviets now are like our buddies. Okay. So instead of all that military budget, we got to get the people doing something in the Pentagon. We're going to build enormous prisons all over the country. We could come campsite guests and put all these criminals in jail where they belong. Okay. To make a safe for the other 50 times. We have a safe. We have a safe. We are going to hell in a hand basket, sir. Yeah. But have a nice day. W-I-O-T. Yeah. I'm touching the L-E-S. You're speaking. Who's Neil? Yes, you're mobile and I just had a feeling that you want to get on right now. Was that right? That's correct. Because you're on the vocal line and they tend to be impatient anyway. Very impatient. Is that the remote? Yes, that's pretty loud. Yeah, we had a good time. You mean you came all the way down from up there? Sure, then. Well, we're on the way. What a guy. Yeah, by Fort Pierce's or Fort Myers. I had a five-tall hour. Yeah. I see what you're talking about. A little Joey, ma'am. What about him? Hi, it's pretty interesting. Oh, in other words, you were one of those ledges there that was looking there leering. Well, I wouldn't worry about him because he had Rick or real busy these days. I don't know what that's all about. But if Anne is listening, I think Rick is expanding his horizons. Not in the female market, eh? Don't be ledger, is sir. All right. But you do have a good-there were a lot of interesting people there of all persuasions yesterday. I was there in the front most of the time I had, um, those, like, whole, bow. I had holes in my jeans. You had holes in your pants? Well, you could have been that great, though, because I sure didn't notice. Oh, man. I don't miss much. Have a great day. I thought to that about. How do you, James Cole? That's a good, this is a good stall for him too, I think. 10,56 don't forget. Now, 12,05 today. I want everybody in their car and their pickup truck and their pop-up toaster and their van. Whatever out there on the highways and highways is out Florida. Right after the new news, we're going to put that sucker on. We're going to play it and I want everybody to open up the windows. Open up the, even if you're on their house, crank the window open. It's a nice breezy day. It's only what about 95. And crank that sucker up, okay. It's the clean version, man. It's the clean version. Two live crew crank it up. And I'm going to say it again. I think there's stuff sucks, okay. I think it is garbage. I think it's just crap. But what the hell difference does it make? That's not the point. I think Ron Jeremy looks like crap too, but that doesn't mean he can't make those grotesque disgusting movies with hair all over everybody's face. A pay phone on the vocal line. Leo. Yeah. During all this stuff with two live crew and a ton of fun from the beat. I see, yeah. I was mentioned anything I heard in the news about that new law, we're all being eaten now. It's probable suspicion, not probable cause. There's an editorial in the Sun Sentinel today. I've got the article yesterday out of the paper. Yeah. Well, this is where we're going now. We're going further and further to the right, pretty soon. They know we'll have the people on the Supreme Court instead of wearing robes. They'll be wearing SS uniforms. Yeah, but not that. That was an immediate call to two live crew and you don't hear anything about that. Because the other stuff isn't a sensation. That's juicy enough. So, most of the people are too stupid to understand the law. So we have to put something juicy on form. Like Madonna. I don't know if you saw any of the adana who you showed this morning, but they filled up a lot of it showing clips from the raceier Madonna. Videos and Bungo V. They put that on because it's all titillation. They're not trying to solve the problems of mankind. They're just trying to get numbers and titillate everybody and show a lot of skin and crap. You know, that's what it's all about. Because that's your right. And that's what people want. It's called the forbidden fruit. It just ridiculous. The rest of the world. Trust me. I know that if anybody is nothing worse than being a forbidden fruit. Well, thanks a lot for listening. Okay, sir. Have a great day. I don't think he has any idea what I was talking about. You think I'm deaf, you think I'll be perfect. What should I say? I'm a dog when I'm so lost in the world. You're my victim. All right, now listen, I think we ought to take a vote. Which one of those should be banned? Okay, I don't think there's any contest. I think it's. Yeah, my poses. Oh, not listen. That should have been well. They did get them out of the state anyway. Let's go to plantation. Plantation. Good morning, now. How you doing? Okay. Hey, Paço. I know for the series. Yeah, let's get off of this. Let's just lay back and be more on. I don't know if I enjoyed it. I was listening on a, I was going to go in the morning to our entow. How is? Yes, like, honey dinner run. And he commented about her earring. Yeah. And she told him, would you like you could wear them? She said, well, if you're right, then you can wear them. Yeah. All right. He didn't answer that. He quickly went on a something now. Well, she's probably got a couple of roll. And I would imagine. And then he's been asked in her husband about a salary fit. Like, she's going to tell the truth. Yeah. He's going to scream. Well, you know, these shameless self promoters that run around. You know, and that's just stuff that sells inside all of a sensational craft. That's what people want today. And other just a bunch of sensationalistic, yellow journalistic minded demore. What's the people out? Listen, how many times are they crying? And they keep beating. They were just, they're beating the dead ones. Well, they better stop beating it. It's real. And we're really just stop beating it. Because they're going to come and get them. Exactly. Amen. I let you got your head on straight. Yeah. I'm going to plant out the driver over to here to plant. I think God, I got changed over. I was going to, I was supposed to stay here. But, and we're running slowly here. But luckily, I've been told that now I'm going to be in my end. Congratulations. You're welcome to the free country. Yeah. Have a great day.

Don't be like a parent repeated everything you hear. I think you're doing a hell of a job in there. That's right. What does that size of your show? Anybody looking at what is it? You don't have the size of your show before Chuck Meyer. So that's a good show. It is a great show. I don't want to get show on the weekend. I understand Chuck came back yesterday after the parents won a game. We came back to work. So you had a good time yesterday, huh? Yeah, we had a great time. Didn't make it.

And those people said that and get a kid to join. They looked like something else. Yeah, nothing. It's good to play about you at all. Well, so they almost have been lying, huh? I listen. Let me just say this to you, okay? Even if he didn't. The fact is he's become so chronic. I just don't go for the chronic. So I really don't. And I've tolerated him for a very well. See, he's a creation of Stan. He's not one of my people. He was from back from I&Z. He's going to Stan's creations. So let him kind of hang out. And he can call in when Stan is on, which is only once about every ten days. That's ample for him, okay? Yeah. As a fun show, Stan has a really nice. Really? Yeah. Well, I'd enjoy that.

While they're telling how it's being banned. It's okay to be on TV just not on the beach. Right. And but like everything is illegal in San Florida. So just keep that in mind. Right. This could be the last phone call you're ever allowed to make. I want to do that. Yeah. That's true. And we're not talking about the number of the number of people who are over taking it in the country. Becoming number one in the country where over taking Arkansas. In the end or so. That's right. We are ready. Number one in the worst education at most dropout. We're right. We're right with Louisiana. The two are battling neck and neck. You know, I think that expression. I think red and neck. Arkansas has always been one of the leaders in education. And red neckness. And I think we're over. No, I'm telling. I'm not joking. Louisiana is number 50. And I think we're number 49 in per capita spending on education. Yeah. And we're getting our bodies worth trust me. Absolutely. And by the way, I want everyone to know that Henry Barrow was the best online man in the business. Exactly. Okay. Keep it up. Till Rick we've equipped his ass out of there. While listen, when you clean out the booze box all the time, him and King, they had to do something about it. Okay. It was cost to the station of fortune. Still cost and said, you ever let Henry back in that ballpark and we'll cut your things off. It's Wild. Yeah. Like you're going to. Okay. We'll cut your water off.

Where's the more worse and more bottles? I've heard all the stories. Anyway. There's a company I don't think. Okay. Listen. Very important news now. And I heard that Tom Jickah had called my can't see who used to be the assassin here. And all the stories about WGR Buffalo and he denied. And he said there was nothing to it. It was all a lie. I'm my capital. And here's radio management weekly magazine. One of these subversive comedy-pinkal rags. NBC's anchors away at WGR. My can't tell he knew Zanker and business news reporter at NBC radio is heading for the PD post to WGR in Buffalo. That's said we're taking a pair of his former Miami Stamper's with him. Talk host Paul Lyle. Uh-huh. Has the name executive manager of News and Talk as well as morning host to WGR. And another former Miami Doug. I was only doing research. Young. We'll join WGR as executive producer of News and Sports. He of course, probably will as executive producer at WGR and OS Palm Beach. And Nick is just really trying to get that job. It's a, how's it coming? Why do you want to leave here? Why would you just because you're a bunch of idiots back there? We're just starting to like Nick. And now he wants to leave us. Okay. Now that Steve's been gone a few months. Nick is finally turning into a human being. And now he wants to leave. Marvin wants off the show. Nick wants to go to West Palm Beach. Pretty soon we'll be sitting here all along. Would Johnny dark? Oh, what a thought that is. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. I mean, I was just bad folks. So, I'm doing. Okay. Did you read this little blur for the paper about the guy who got arrested for the T-shirts for 10 days? No. In the front page. A little burp. Yeah. This is really great. It says that in the invernance Florida prosecutors dropped charges to the man. Uh, he came to the day is in court. Anyway, he wore a shirt in the court that says falling ass. Oh, my God. It says with a drawing of a pickup and four products of hanging over the tailgate. And the judge dropped their original charges and gave him 10 days in jail for this. Is that crazy? I would be better to think of I had a little doggs line to brawla some cards so we could play. We could get used to it. We could learn the words to it. Okay. I don't know. The awkward Christian soldiers got the same kind of meter to a dada dada. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I was coming home the other night on West to see highway in the North Miami area. And they had a sign up in the middle of West to see that said drug check at 11 o'clock at night with Flares in the road. Oh, yeah. And they pulled everybody over. It didn't bother me because I got an old Honda, but I got to tell you I was thinking of you. I thought if they were to shake dogs start slappering in the front seat of your back. I was looking for drugs. You had a guy crazy. Now, where was this? This was on West, 16 highway in North Miami. I live in North Miami. I was coming home from work. I'm not sure. No, no, no, no. What does that mean? What the hell does that mean? It does that sign. Three by three at least six seven police cars about four dogs on leash. This big German shopper is in it said drug check. They pulled everybody over. They asked you to step out of your car. You driver's license. Your road is registration. And they let the dogs go through the car. And there's a big dog starts slappering all the way to this road. I'm not going to take any big dog. Let them sleep in my dog. Don't get into the Corvette. Okay. If they think they're going to slaughter all over my car, they can slaughter all over their butt. Okay. They're crazy. In closing. Oh, my God. Like I said, don't think Broward's back because date is just as bad. In closing, may I call my brother, Dr. George a super douchebag? See. Thanks. Hello, sir. Comonista, Comonista, Comonista. Oh, man. What are those little boots I hear marching in the back? They've got marching on the building. Wild. Yeah. I like to do the things. Big softly sir, because they're listening. Well, they're monitoring out there in radio land. The fastest pigs are monitoring our conversations. Yes sir. Don't say it to him out. Whatever this. Am I on the air? Yes. Do you know that? Quietly. Okay. Very careful. From the Joseph Gerbow School of Propagand, Comonista, Comonista, Comonista. You probably know that your name was mentioned on Adani. Yeah. But do you know that? We aren't discussing it. You know that Larry King mentioned your name when it came. Larry King don't even know who I am. Here we have somebody in place. What am I thinking? I don't know who that is. I don't know who that is. Let's touch it to that one. So I find it very clear. And then they'll do it to that. Yeah, right. That's just about what he said last night. One. Somebody called him up from Florida and said that some a club show host was advocating. He was using car speakers that said hog to flari-king those you money. Great. Larry King said who the talk show host and he called. And then they'll do it best. The call said Neil Rogers. And he said Neil Rogers. He said, have a heard about him at about 12 years. Hi, this is Larry. No, they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. Yeah. That is up he's still on radio. But I know he's been doing that. I think that he's heard some real good ships since he has heard my name in 12 years. Let's not clear it is. Hi, this is Larry King and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. And I'm going to do it that. Yeah. That's what he says. He said he hadn't heard about him 12 years. Yeah. Where's thinking he heard you doing college baseball? Right. He said it was on a new radio show. His response is always a put down of anybody else because he can't stand the fact that people expose him for the piece of crap that he really is. Okay. He can make he can make a hundred million dollars here and you know what? He's still a piece of crap and he still didn't pay anybody back in his town. He's still screwed a lot of people over and he's still garbage. Okay. He's got a big note. He was on your station by the way. And he was in flames. He's a spenders. Oh, I know it. It was on I do. Well, no matter where he is, he's still a piece of crap. Maybe you can get a recording of it. Oh, you're saying. Listen, at least in the eye. Could be. I mean, if that's my biggest story in my life, I got a real I have no life. Well, you were the same as guy. Yeah, sure. And between Luther Campbell and Larry King, I mean, and then they'll do it that. Well, thank you. You're getting national exposure. So to speak. Have a nice life. Thank you. It's 11.21 in WODD. And while it's still legal, spec music. Okay. I hope you're listening carefully that Rick and Puts promo. That was the radio sued that I was referring to earlier. Call him yesterday. And at the end of that call, he went into this big thing about all how he agreed with Rick and he just absolutely disapproves of profanity on the air. And I wish when he hung up, he would have said, but load. Okay. I think they would have been a perfect ending. Here's a mobile and brown. Neil. Yeah. Good thing he put me on hold because you allowed me to get into the face zone. I was south on the US one hour. So there is no safe zone. Did you hear the guy was just talking about the drug. I just got the drug. Yeah. Sir can see his pal. Well, I got to watch out. Get out of the car and get on your knees because we're going to search. And we're going to see you. And I'm afraid of what they might see, you know. I'm going to search and clean. Watch out. Fash is round shirt picks up there. Okay. And then I'm going to be on I 75. The only reason I mean, there's a little bit of resurfacing. A road to repair. It's going on in very little limited stretches. And they still got that hole like 10 or 15 miles like 45 miles an hour. So those picks can sit there and write business. Who the hell are they kidding? Who the hell is who? Turning into a police day. Now, you're very Gary signs column in the four. Lard on the. Yeah, he and the Ray Wretch. You write a lot of good stuff. But it is. It's like howling into the wind. Okay. Like whistling into a wind storm. But he had something need last. We got to know if you talked about it. I don't usually get to listen because I'm working. But today, I happen to be driving and on license plates and Florida, the number of license plates. Now, we need to do is get the legislators to get rid of all of them. And just take your swan stick idea and put a swan stick on the state of Florida license. Yeah, that's what you get a couple of circles with a slash through a fading suit. Yeah, or a. We were going to do a lot. Duns can't put a good. That would really define Florida. Yeah, maybe a little hood. And I always wanted ways new jersey the garden state. He doesn't license plates. Nothing to do with it. Well, if you ever smelted, you'd wonder what kind of a garden. Well, maybe they had a lot of fertilizer. I don't know. Which is smell and jersey. I tell you that. But actually around Newark and Trenton. Hmm. So maybe we have to do this with the license plate. And aroma that could really turn your life upside down. Anyway, watch out for Nick the stick. Okay. No, that's not Nick. That's seek. The viral with two S's as an SS. Oh, I like that. You have to say with a civil and sound like me. The bottle. And what he hears is a little civil and sound that will make him real nervous too. See, Nick the steek. You got it. Okay. Twenty seven after 11 and WIOD. And now, I'm a guy to present. And on to that. Hello. Hi, I'm Ben Edwards. And I'm first one, Mary with them. And welcome to Men On Film. We're going to be reviewing the latest film from a male point of view. First of is that contribution movie due to right spin. Now, I really like little Spike Lee's character, Nick and his film. I especially like what he makes the ratio of tension with the balance in order to give his message due to right spin. Come on out to class. Don't be afraid to be here. Black, white, what if? Hey, that's a true proof. Now, I like to talk about Nick's sighting no film. Karate Keeat, part three. It's all about Nick working off his powers in a very physical way. It was all so primitive. And you know, I'm going to enjoy the misamiya. He played by a little Pat Marito. And that Ralph Marshall, three words. Bath, you love him. Boy, I hope I look that good when I'm 40. But I'm not so just agree. I disagree that just too much balance to his name. Don't get me. You better give me back my song. Don't make me because I'm beautiful. They went all wrong. What's all this kicking about? This is a movie about relationship. This could have been a beautiful picture about the special friendship between a mature, masculine, old-a-man. And a tender, rambling, consenting young men. The acting America is ready for this. You know I know I am. Bet you is. Yeah, I like to talk about it. I feel my best interest in the sea. Great ball for fire. I ain't going to touch you. But the title alone gets too snatched up. The film is about to be released. The film is about to be released. Now let's talk about the film that I soon come out on video. First up is black widow. Time to re-surface her and never winger. Hey, ladies. Also coming out is the firecracker.

Never using initiative. What did she suppose to be? I needêmetode. What do you think of clay clothes? Oh, I love him. And I really have to admire the beautiful day to cast a man in that role. I mean, that really made the picture for me. Along, Glenn Closte and the woman. Push the pearls, what a thing. Oh, he's so cute. Well, look like we almost out of time. But you joined us next week when we talk about Mel Giffles' little weapon. I hope it's loaded. What the hell is that? Oh, I see. That's dead. Anywhere. I'm pretty wide, y'all. I'm dying over here. Okay, 1134, I WIWD, a mobile in Boka. Oh, my God. And they're actually there. I can't believe it. Over 10 minutes, but they're your weapons. I know it. Listen, I went to your remote. I'm from full load of down. I went down here. It was a nice load of remote. Yeah, we had a good time. The silver was great. Well, that's not- Now he is. That's why he's at his best. That's the only time he's at a good. Although Kevin, we need to give Kevin a long rest. Okay. I heard him call Rick and cried yesterday afternoon. Kevin, you need desperately to get some semblance of a life. That kid, I mean, he just like beyond chronic. Where's the hundred yards beyond chronic? That guy that was behind you with the tie-insuit was at Tom Denver. With the grace of... No, that was Scott Schwartz. Now, Denver was a little, uh, midget guy that put the news to Rodgers neck and everybody started applauding and foaming at the mouth and they ran the hell out of there. Yeah, well, can you just have to tell me, I guess. Gilville was ramen. Tom's still hanging out there, by the way. Let's do one quick question. I know you, I don't know if you mentioned it, but you said, not about Tony, you said, yeah. You said not about Tony, you said not about you. You said it was talking about you? No, it's Luther Campbell, not Tony. I was not even going to know me from where she put it. Was it good, uh? Yeah. All right. That's great. I just want to know what they said, you know? No. No, I'll just say. Now, he said, Neil Rodgers is horny, something like that. Have a great day. Hey, play with me. W-Y-O-D. Yeah, hi, Neil, please. Speaking. Yeah, hi, Neil, please. Peter?

Did you meet that article in, uh, Charles Widdard, Odeco-Ron? In my him and hell this morning? Oh, Bob? About? About the crew? No. All right. You should take a look at it. It's very interesting. About everything is obscene. You can't do a thing. It's correct. It's something. Well, listen, we can all keep talking about it forever, but I mean, it's just, uh, nobody's going to do anything about it. We just did back. We allowed this to go on. We're going to do a very, we keep talking about how, uh, you know, Gorbachele keeps the freeing all these formerly communist, uh, Soviet dominated countries and they're having free elections. And now we got the Berlin wall is come down and all this other country. And to mean time, we're going in the opposite direction. If they're still there, I'm going to be democratic and freeing. We're going to be sitting here in a Nazi concentration camp somewhere. It says here article 8847001. He says you cannot live with somebody. If you're not married, you can't do this. And you can't do that. It is correct, sir. I love him to come in this America. It's a terrible. Well, I hope you feel well. Keep your passport hand. I love. Thank you. Okay. 1037. That's why we're only advised everybody. Just keep your passport out and, uh, keep a credit card a good one. Handy sitting by a quick airline ticket. We have an opening in Boca and Palm Beach.

Good morning, my radio friend. Yes, sir. A little thought for you. I'll bet. I agree with you about all this stuff about. Ten action roll. There he goes. Go ahead. I'm listening. Twenty seconds of that. And it gives me no. I'm listening. I just don't want to see your voice. Is there certain drone in it, you know? You want to. So you're right. Too much censorship is bad. I agree with you all. There's a big. Big. But what the WLS side. But burning the flag is is. I think when you do that, okay, if like going to capture. I am going to go. I am. I am. I'm. I'm. You are so juvenile. That's beyond. I'm. Sir, can I say something to you? Sure. When I see literature from the Ku Klux clan or the American Nazis, it touches a lot of nerves and me too, but that doesn't mean I'm going to run around saying that they should be suppressed or made illegal or they can't express their grotesque disgusting opinion. That's what makes this country great is. It's a pluralistic nation diversity of opinion no matter how unacceptable it may be. You are me. That's what makes it a great country. Once you take away political descent, whether it's burning of a flag or making a speech or marching on a White House, you're talking about fascism, okay? But it's different. It's not different. Are you that's. Who could hear that you're the victim of blind symbols? I mean, I can't believe that somebody who sounds fairly intelligent. No, I can't believe. But it's more intelligent way to express your a dissatisfaction with the country. The murder. You're not in a position to decide whether it's intelligent or not. Whether you agree with it or not is not the point and you didn't listen to what damn thing I just said. I heard everything words you said. I heard you as a little bit, but I just think that there's nothing to disagree whether you think it's necessary or not isn't relevant. Nobody's going to ask your permission. If that's why they want to express their dissent or they just want to do it for the hell of it, if I go out and buy an American flag for 10 bucks in Kmart, and I want to take it home and burn it in the backyard. None of the governments guide the end business. Okay, it's my property. It's not hurting anybody else. It's not hurting anybody else's property. It's not taking away anybody else's rights and it's nobody's damn business. You're right. They want to go clothing you. 21 till noon at WI or the your friendly station. What the hell am I getting it? This is just like old times. I don't work in WS News anymore. Let them scream and ho. I don't want to argue with you. Okay, Pat, you're an idiot. You're an idiot. You're a moron. You're one of those George Bush's sick offense. It's going to follow him all the way into the into Shabbaz ravine. A mobile in Boka. What is this? Hi, how are you? Okay. The word for today on this show is agitated. Agitated. I can relate to that because they have to read the paper and I'm just going on with two lives crew. I need more agitated. You know, 25 years. 25 years ago, and I'm in my 40s, my parents bought bill bars and pearl Williams record. Yeah, Shabbard Fox. I'm telling you, and in those days, you couldn't get any more obscene than that. And you bought it over the counter. You took a home. Nobody said, boo. And if you wanted it, you played it. Yeah. Now they're doing a blood bath for no reason. I have to play it on a pornograph. Exactly. If you played it in your car, you could be arrested. But they're taking the wall down overseas. And I think they're putting it up on 995. No, they're putting it up on a 1a and for Lauderdale. Mayor Cox and Steve are going to be there together to do not break a bottle or two over it. It's unbelievable. I mean, you're right. You got to keep a pass for now. This is just unbelievable for no reason at all. I mean, when this guy called before about the drug check in day County, how they're pulling everybody over, get out of the car and the dogs are sniffing around. See, that's the new Supreme Corp ruling. They don't need reasonable cause. They can just come and for any reason. Oh, wow. We think maybe you look suspicious. Maybe you got some cracking there. And that's it. But you can burn the flag. This makes sense. I mean, I personally don't care because it's not a fan. But burning that look, the burning the flag is, you know, I mean, even this right wing Supreme Court can't hold that one up. Okay. Exactly. You're lying to that last guy that called a joke. It's offensive. Well, it's tough. But it is okay. Yeah, man. I think if you want to burn the flag, that's an opinion. You can do it. But yet the bottom line is where are? Where's the freedom? You want to play a bit? Well, we don't have any. We talk a lot about it in this country, but we don't have it any. And what annoys me is they're resting shop owners for selling the record. Yeah, to adults. The models, they can play. So how about if you go into a bookstore and you buy the Tropic of cancer? Okay. With all those four letter words and all that sexual, like every other word. Are they going to arrest you for buying a porter? Or can I have to get an elementary school student to interpret it? Maybe we have a judge Gonzalez who will on all of these books. He's going to be real busy very soon. Judging Gonzalez, I have to start reading all these books and see all those movies. See a book. They can be like the dictator for all the rest of us in this side. Who ought to get nice? What we can read? What we can watch? What we can listen to? What we can play in our car? I'll tell you one thing. I really hope they have good attorneys and they will The streets with Navarro. I want to tell you something. Bruce Rogo, unfortunately, is the local attorney for two live crew who is a said, suit a wood lexuel walk it around with a Type-plent between his teeth, mouthing a lot of suit a wood lexuel crap that nobody understands. It would Bruce Rogo as their attorney. They'll all wind up in a slimmer. Okay. He is hopeless. Tragedick. They need some guy like like, like, consular was on the CBS this morning. For his fire and brimstone who will take the gloves off and go right in the trenches with all these pigs and really let them have it. That's what they need. They have to because their has got to be constitutional rights. I mean, the fact that they're telling innocent people like you are eye or anybody else out there, what we can play in our car? I mean, don't you think you've gone a little far? That's your seat to you, man. Have a nice day. Thank you. Bye-bye. That's NISSE. 1143 at WIOG, the land of the free and the home of the grave, man. We're going to have a little drug check at noon. And then if everybody passes at 1205 right after the news, we're going to come back and crank it up and piss off Sheriff Seeknevarl and everybody in the car is just open a windows, crank it up real loud. We'll play three, four minutes of it. And see if anybody gets busted, it's the clean version. And as much as I think there's stuff is really garbage. I will say this. Luther Campbell had a very good point on Donnie through this morning. And that is they are the only ones the only group with all this other crap that's out. What happened to the front label of this? How did that disappear? I don't know. Oh, it's in the basket. But they've got that. I mean, you have to be blind not to see it. It's right across the cover. As clean as they want to be and it's got a big thing across the front cover. All the butts, all the cheeks, this album does not contain explicit lyrics. And the other one, which of course you can't buy for a lover money now, is just the opposite. It says, as nasty as they want to be and it's a warning that it does contain him. Okay? So if you don't want to be offended, you don't want to hear the explicit lyrics. Don't buy it. Simple as that. And the thing that adults can't pick and choose what they're going to be offended by or what they're going to listen to. Just be a little, just be a little so-and-kids out and start embroidering those swastikers right now. Miami, hello. No. I call the response of that guy that called earlier about the call to Larry King. That was me and you should hear this. Why don't you will not believe the ignorance. I wanted to expose him for what he was. And if you have one second, you're going to see where the one part ties it to the other. Okay. If I can play this for one second. Where one part ties into the other. What's the answer to the question? On fact, I don't know one that had the stickers. My brother had the stickers made up. That one's about his bumper sticker. How come we don't have a bunch of them to send out? You want some more? Hi. You're alone as a proof, right? Yeah. What's the answer to the question? If you can give me like 10 seconds. One part I talked about him being prejudice and I'm going to expose him. And you come in in the last minute. And you'll see what I mean by this. And then we'll do it that. Okay. I hear nothing. I hear nothing. I am. Here we go. Hey there. Hi. I want to ask you. I have two quick points. First off, you say you cannot understand prejudice. Do you deny having one prejudice phone in your body? I deny having prejudice is borough my body regarding race creed. That's all I do. You've never said, pertaining to someone's safety or freckles or their fat or skinny. That's prejudice whether it's a particular race or not. That is unappealing to me. Why not? You're part of coming up. Not things that people are inferior or superior to skinny. But if you're, that's your, I don't like. Ragnar people would be noses. But I'm not prejudice against Brock's. Brock's. You're right. You're right. Why are you? Brock's. You're right. You're right. Brock's. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You're right. You want to call that prejudice. No, but it's just a call around when you're trying to come across. You're saying that you don't have a prejudice. What do you answer to the question? I mean, I'm not prejudice. Are you prejudice? I'm not prejudice. The other thing is, I'm prejudice. What are we going to get to this? Okay. I'm going to go to the call. I'll go to the call. I'll go to the call. I'm going to the call. I'll go to the call. What are we going to get to this call. Now we asked you when my thing I just moved here to Miami. A couple years ago and I, um, there's a talk show host that he talks about you a lot and then he said there was a bumper sticker and it's in Hark, if Larry King owes you money, did you tell me what that is? I've no idea who is those. I've some guy named. Bill Rogers. I last thought him about what was when he he's the admitted they came on the air and say he was homosexual. That's the last time I've ever heard Neil Rogers, which had to be 13 years ago. And then the blue head. I've been he's still on the air. Oh, yeah, I've packed supposedly just ratings are very high. I never heard him. But he was always trashed you. And I just didn't know. Well, there's a lot of people who do that because they're jealous. Five of the things they don't come any better than Rogers Entertainment Report. OK, sorry. Great. Well, I'm 47 in WIOD and we want to tell you about Toyota Hollywood where there haven't some big doings. Yeah, I'm very king and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. Excuse me. Is that a bugle in your chain? Why, yes, it is. Get in. I know flight of the Bumble Beach. OK, let me 51 a WIOD dean and let's what do you mean Delaware? Delaware. Yeah. There's no one else that can get into that. No, Malvin worked this morning. Oh. We're nearies up in Orlando. Why are you writing a book? Well, it sounded like, what are you wanting to check the phone? Exactly. Yeah. Well, I just call it like I'm not in Nick. He's like right on the edge now. He's got a great job offer in West Palm Beach and he's anxious to work with Lee Fowler. Really? We're going to screen Joel's WIOD news stories. Are you going to go up the jewelry? Go ahead, sir. What do you want? Anyway, I called the election. I got home already. Great. And I heard on the way home that you didn't have a good night last night. Cups lost both games. I had a fine night last night. OK, my life isn't determined by if my life was determined by whether it comes when or lose, I'd already be six feet in the ground. Yeah. Everything is wonderful. OK, it's just a ball game. I heard a story on the way home. Oh, I didn't know whether. God. Well, you want to know the answer to this. I don't know anything. Because it's like, I mean, this call is exciting as your last call. It's going to be so short that you'll be seeing stars in your eyes. I will listen. I heard on the way home. On the way home? Yeah, about 10 years ago, there was a school teacher by the name of Alice Cooper. Yeah. It all of her students covered the Zirkin and she ended up in. Oh, you're so cute. Was that a collect call by the way, Nick? You call it, don't ever accept the call for me again. He is so boring and so terminal. You can hear the dials clicking all over town. I think it's a setup because right after noon, probably Sheriff's Seek got into calling it, OK? And taste the whole audience away. So with 12.05, when we play that thing and ask you, where did Crank it up? Nobody will be listening. What? I don't know what that mean. What did he say? I couldn't hear what he said. What? Oh, that just means school. Well, that's, he said a square loud. OK, he's done it with that is. I didn't hear what he said. So I just took, you know, never taken any chances on this show. Because here at WOD, we're pretty damn nervous. And they have very right to be. Well, I don't know what is it. Oh, geez. Oh, man. On MTV. Is that MTV we have on? Oh, God. All I can say is, I'm dying of it. Man, I'm going to tell you, it's like a creeping illness. Miami. Hi, how are you doing? OK. Great. I got a billboard report for you. It's going up the floor. No, that will be the blonde. Where that like ooze. We're just oozing over and spreading. Anyway, that's how this whole business is. It's just everywhere. Well, it's why I'm trying to divert from it. Good. Let's let's be diverse or perverse or whatever you want. Whatever you want to do. I'm open for anything. I'll be if I can say that. But I was cruise up the palm better the other day. Don't say cruise him. I, I, I, I'm sorry. I was driving up the palm. I don't. And the billboard that was up for you just below 130. She just been replaced by a radio, mom. Be.

situation that we can all understand whether we have kids or pets or near if we don't have to get out of your aisle and here's what he likes dear Casey this may seem to be a strange dedication request
