Let's see, four times, six, 24. That means in another year he'll be 74. And in two years he'll be 100. Even the fuzel couldn't match that. I'm calling the right number. I know that. It's not busy and nobody answers and he's got a boring show. Now let me ask you a question. If I put that on the hole, is there nothing? What? What is she shaker? What the hell do you know? If I put that on the hole, do we feed the program on the bat line too? So he'll okay. So I'll put it on the hole. And the just in case they pick it up, I don't know what's here, which would be great. They'll piss him off. You're calling what? Forests, honey. Four. Yeah, that's the number. So what I just dialed, meathead? What? You're calling it busy? In other words, you don't think I can dial the damn phone. Is that what you're saying? I think if it's a contest between you and me, we need to take a vote. Kendall. Yeah. Till Alex. Rob's your forehead. Then I tell you what, he's ever rubbed his forehead. He'd have to start at two o'clock in the morning. And go to a noon. He has a forehead from his chin to his, it's a puppet. 11 after noon at WIOD, where we have a morning show in the morning, and midday show in the midday, and we have to do a show between two and six. We give the time. The weather, the temperature, the sports scores, and all kinds of information. And a lot of corny ridiculous promos that our consultants think are going to really dance of you, because they're boring and terminal. How come they don't answer at the switchboard either? Boy, I'm telling you, what a station they got. I thought we were efficient here. All right, let me try one more number here. Oh, six, six. I mean, this place, they're all out to lunch and it's only like nine, 10 after nine a morning out there or something. How far is good morning? Yeah, I've been dialing the, this is WIOD in Miami, and you'll ride just calling, we're on the air. Uh-huh. And we've been dialing the, on the airline to try to get a whole Alex, but it are good buddy. Uh-huh. And nobody answers the phone. All right, hang in there. Let me see what I can do for you. Yeah, just for a second. Are you Nick? I'm Nick Rogers. I know you just clouded, right? No, this is Neil Rogers. That was Nick Lawrence had just called. Okay. What did Nick, what was Nick doing? He was calling, he was calling asking to speak to, I'm lawyer Alex. And I had informed her that they were doing the show or something. And I would pass them. Well, we're doing a show too. You and I are on the air right now. It was just pretty exciting, right? Well, that's great. In Miami, even though Alex didn't like it, they were not that bad. Let me find, let me find out what's going on. Wait a minute. Let me ask you a question. You want to ask me a question, okay? Is that okay? Sure. What's the temperature there today? The temperature right now is about 60. Oh, about 65. It's rough human here in the city. Ooh. And it's going to get up in the 70's today, which is like a heat wave for you guys. Yeah, plus it's human. Where do you see how humidity is? Well, it's like 87 here now. Of course, it's 12 13 here. It's only 9 13 there. All right. We have to have a thunderstorm in lightning and the South Bay last night, which is the rare. And sounds like pretty lousy weather. Well, it's, it is lousy, but you know, it's exciting to show you down. So how is Alan in thunderstorm? So how is Alan still in the world on far? They're right. He's very big in San Francisco. Yeah, he's doing pretty good. We're an old guy. Yeah, he's doing pretty good. Right now they think, we, um, I don't know. We had a long show today and I don't know. We really were tapity, but. Yeah. How about that studio audience? Still, I answer good. They've been pretty quiet though this week. Just a day. But usually they get kind of rowdy and they get really excited and stuff like that. But it's a good thing that they have going. Yeah, well, like how many people come in every day? Uh, let's say it's about 20. As much as a studio can hold the studio in that big. 20, so maybe one, about the biggest of 10. How about like, can we go for five? No. No, I'm just kidding. I'm poor. You wouldn't like it. And like, what are these like? Because the show starts at what? 5.36 in the morning? 6.6 to 10. Yeah. So these people come in by what time? Um, they usually I just get here about to quarter us. For six. Yeah. And they line out, you know, I came by. What are they like street people? Is that it? No. They're trying to for a little break. It is mostly them are basically the work in the evening or or students or something. Or do you generally? It's a different crowd. Yeah. I thought you were really, you've got that place packed. I don't know how long have you been working there? Um, I just came in. I just came in about. Well, that's why you're so refreshingly honest. About three weeks. I haven't brainwashed you yet and they've got a lot of phony propaganda. Great. So in other words, he's doing okay. Yeah. What you saw in the radio, though, before another station. What station was that? Um, well, I mean, we're not on the air in San Francisco or on the air Miami. Oh, well, are you sure? Can I? Okay. Well, that's a big station. Can I? Can't. What's the most Syracuse used to work there? Yeah. You do? Yeah, I know. Did you ever hear Joey Reynolds? No. Oh, thank God. Oh, I'm the old Rogers. You never heard of me either. Oh, okay. I hope. Unless you listen to Alex Bash me on the air out there until I tell you that it's a bad. No, Alex loves Miami, don't he? Yeah, he does. No, he does. He hates us like poison. He does. He does love. Now, he just celebrate what is he? He just missed the barrier. He just celebrated and he missed the gay area. That's the big. He celebrated his part of our show. You should not. That's part of your show. That's part of what he's going through this morning. What is that? And then I call it on the air or something. And what about how he does all that gay bashing on the air? Yeah, and it's actually not him. We have different communities. It's all like Andrew Duce Clay and the Allowsbury Sam Kinnison, all his slime ball, Homma, full big people. You don't go on here in the house. How big are you? You should be in San Francisco right now. I should. Yeah. Why is that? They probably shoot you for what? For what you just said, they don't. Well, not not saying the whole San Francisco is like that. For what? And what's wrong with that? That's like said with affection and love. Okay. Now, anyway, you sidetracked me. I can I talk to people like you before you're like, put me off on a with tangent. I was really getting the heart of the matter. Okay. So do you think we can get him on the air for a minute? Yeah, let me try. Okay. Let me try to find his producer. Listen, when you say neo-roggers and if he starts throwing things, don't get his Storical. Okay, because he's a very emotional man. I'll just tell him. Look at his. Yeah, we had some fun here, right? Yeah. I'll just tell him. I had a great conversation with him. Yeah, we had some fun here, right? Yeah. I'll just tell him I had a great conversation with you. Let me find him, okay? Can I ask you a question? Yes. Because we've been. You and I have been talking now for about four or five minutes. Yes. And am I keeping you from any other calls that are coming? I can't believe it. This is not ringing. I'm ringing. I'm ringing. And because it's like your commercial radio station, right? This is just like a high school station. Are you holding on my calls or something? Yeah, we put them on hold. Did you? All right. Now let's see what Alex does. Let's see. When you mention my name. I want to find out what kind of object he throws. Let me run in there now and tell him why he's not on here. Okay, because he'll go nuts. Hang on. Hang on. This is great. I haven't had so much fun since Joe's a Ganky went for vacation. It's 1217 in Wild. We do have some open lines here. I'll tell you that. People are dropping off. Now I got news for you. I think I'm going to preempt this great call for a lot of your friends. I'm going to tell you about the show. This is not the show. Does he play music? He plays voice of the answer. I thought, what does he do? He doesn't do a talk show. He never did a talk show. Oh, these bulls, those here, man. They brought this guy and all he does is that. Reduce this coming here. They're right with you. Don't fall. Wait a minute. Are you busy? Yeah, I have to answer another call. Okay. Hold on. Okay. You all know about him. I'll kill somebody. I better get the right car to the machine now. Somebody loves you. Oh, nobody. If somebody loves you. Get in the right wheel. If I had the ability to do, I think you're out here right now. Kick your goddamn teeth in. Yes. Oh, yeah. Sorry. How are you doing? I'm fine. Let me. Yeah. Yeah. I cut that back a little bit back there. We want to hear a lorry. We don't want to hear all that rock is rock. Right? Right, lorry? Yeah. We don't want to hear all that noise. We call it now. We call to speak to you. Okay. So what's going on, lorry? What's going on, lorry? What's going on here? Yeah, we're on the year on WIOD and my own Alex's favorite station. I see, I see. And there's this big article that somebody brought in from the Marine Independent Journal, I guess, is one of your really big papers. Yeah. That's been an actually been numerous papers. Yeah, Alex, he's just had a TV, I guess, on Friday or last Friday, I don't know. He's just all over the place. It's amazing. And since he's such a, he loved Miami so much and such a big fan of the station, me and particular. I thought we'd call them and check in with them. Well, actually, Alex can't pop in out because he's on the air. But I'm on the air, too. Well, I know what he's doing. He's on the air now. I don't think it would really be appropriate this time. But I do appreciate your calling. Oh, wait, now, are you like blowing me off for this? That what you're doing? I mean, I am because he can't really do it right now. Well, wait, man, did you tell him that I was on the phone? He knows. He knows him on the phone and that's why he won't come to the phone. He said he doesn't do smile on markets. He doesn't do smaller markets. Well, I have his resume here and it seems to me that he once worked in Reno, Nevada. Well, I'm just telling you. I'm just telling you. I'm just telling you. I'm just telling you. Yeah, well, that's pretty good. You're calling anyway. Well, wait a minute. You're letting other people in the conversation. Yeah, because I had to get back to this. So I can't ask you like what kind of a show he does out there. He plays a lot of music or... No, we do. I'm sorry. I see. You don't take any calls on the air. I can't even do. But you just don't get mad at me, right? We do. At times. But we can't really take off a class because, you know, when a conversation is for everybody. Right. Well, like who's on today? So we had Roger Craig. We had Tiffany, but on the other day. Well, you mean, Roger? Yeah. Well, that's pretty exciting. Well, they're doing it. Yeah, they're moving up a little bit. And you had who? You had Cisco and the e-bird? Yeah. Why? Well, you guys don't muck you around. Well, tell them we're going to work real hard. So one day we can work in a big market like that, too. Okay? Give a big kiss on that forehead and tell them happy 50th birthday. Okay. Bye, Laurie. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay. Bye, Laurie. Bye, Laurie. Okay. Okay. What a piece of crap. A 20 after noon at WID. You know, it was around the whole year. You didn't talk to smaller markets. They're on news for you. The biggest market you were in in your life was publics. Anyway, we have an open line in Palm Beach at 655 in the fruit section. 655, 9463. And we also have Star IoT talked to Cisco and e-bird and Roger Craig. Woo! In the same day. Boy, we had what the hell? We need that. We need a little bit of air lines. We don't need that crap. Boy, boy. So in other words, that's not like a little hostile call to you. I mean, would that be the other statement of the century? Just a wee bit of hostility? God. That sounded like talking to Rick Edwards. 21 past noon at WID and let's ask you a little question here. Are you sick and tired of paying through the no more? A guy who can't even have a little bit of fun, a condescending mung head. That's what we're dealing with. Okay. We got lots of open lines. I know that took a long time. We've been screwing around, but that's too bad. Okay, because to me, there was a lot more entertaining than talking to a bunch of skinheads. We have an open line in Broward 524Wild, D1 in Palm Beach, 655 Fowler, and the star Iowd, of course, at $400 a minute. Let's go to a mobile and for a louder nail. You're still there. I can't believe it. I can't. I just do. But it was well worth it, though, wasn't it? I got a cheap car phone. I can afford it. I mean, what an experience that was. So I'm experienced as Alex. He sounded like his twin sister. Sir Ali, hostile, inhospitable, humorless, psychotic. God, I'm glad he went back. He should have stayed. He's done well. He continued. Well, I tell you, those people out there, they really know their entertainment. They know how to stuff when they hear it. Alex is from, is I don't think he knows what big is, really. He doesn't know what? He doesn't know what big is. Well, I don't want to get into his personal life. Well, I know. Oh, well, that's what I tell you. It's a great as fit you've done since you've been back. Where do they held you went? Yeah. I was still trying to figure out what the hell's going on. Well, I was in San Francisco, hanging out with Alex in his crowd. I thought I had a good time. Must be very careful, Neil. See you. Take care. 26 past noon at WIOD, an opening in Broward 524 WIOD. Who's that on a bad line? Is that Alex calling back? Begging for our forgiveness, not to private call or that. WIOD. Hi, I'm Concherniel. Sure, hold on. WIOD. Hey, Neil, you're doing great. Hey, listen, you just got me in the mood for this. You nailed my money for what? For this, what they call it? Movies with this black on top. Blender box, letter box. Come on, get what? What kind of a slob are you? I'm ready to an expert. I want to go watch a letter box movie. It's in the coffee house. Listen to beat Nick music. Yeah, and I'm still there. There you go. He's a heavy, heavy duty crab. Hey, I never even seen letter box. Well, he was so fun to rope without the soap. What is it? He talked about that letter box. Well, I don't want to bring that in there. It's like, it's kind of like Letterman. It's the same thing. Like DC. Yeah. All right, Neil. I wish you would've got a hold of him. No, I'd be honest with you that this was more fun. It was. In other words, we got the same effect without having to put up with his whiny, uh, crappy bull. What you say we can't speak to people in small markets? He doesn't do small markets. And he's got something to solve a market. Yeah, it's correct. Have a good day. Hold and wrinkle too. And I don't mean his forehead. See a 28 past noon at WIOD. There's an opening in Broward, if you were real fast, now if you want to get on on the hit parade. And if you're real nice to me, I'll give you a Steve's numbers again from WVC. That's cool. Why am I doing that? Because I don't really have any big deal with Steve, but we're a puts wants to hear him again. And of course, puts wish you see to be in a here to talk to Alex because he's one of his favorites. He is so fun to Alex. Uh, I got to see if you see this article. When you get to that part about his 50th birthday, you'll really enjoy that to the. And he's still he likes Alex so much. He has that picture of him right in his briefcase. One with a circle around it. And the bull's eye right over the middle of his forehead over that big bald spot. Hollywood. Hello. Yes. Hollywood. Isn't that a little. No, that's Neil. This is Hollywood. Sir. Neil. The amateur comics go on the Alex bedding soon. I really want to see you. I'll be out there. I'm talking out there and it probably rubbed off on you through the phone, but try to control yourself. You're right because I've been. Oh, you're not nice. We'll bring Eric Lambert back in with what's Larry. Oh, don't do that. Would Larry, Brent, learn stereo. Don't do that. Okay. Yeah. Two things. Where's Gilbert? What is that supposed to? That all right. Second off on on on the point of Gilbert. No, I don't want to discuss. Gilbert. Gilbert will be at our remote on the 24th of this month over at the stadium up there. And we're doing another miracle game. I just want to let you in on a little hint here. You've been giving out stock tips. And I've gotten two from and so far. And they went up. Well, I'm delighted for him. Take over the second. Column McGreen. No, no, no, no, no. I don't like her. We have an open line in date. 751 Gilbert. 751. Yeah. Neil. What do you want? Tell me this. This could be the worst call even worse than Super Dave. Okay. And that's saying a lot. This is one of the worst calls in history. WQ. Let's talk about other people. Talk about yourself. They went to 50. Stopping like a quizling, stopping and underling of other people. Be a be your own person. If QAM went to 50s. Does that mean IOD is going to 60s and NWS is going to 70s. We're going to 1860s right after this call ends, which is right now. 1230 at WIOD. Three open lines in a board. Boy, which we were as popular as Alex Bennett. What I wouldn't give. I left my heart. We have an open it on the star IOD line is $4,000 a minute. If you have the guts to stand out in the crowd and see all you people are doing is hanging back and waiting for the day that I come on a year and say, hey, bell south mobility. Finally got their finger out of there. But and they got their act straight. Now then you can call that line and we pay for it now. Now I got news for you. We may not live that long. Okay. Any of us. We'll be back in the waiting. Kendall. How you doing? Okay. Wait. You know what? Schwartzman hasn't improved at all. Schwartzman. Yeah. That's correct. There you go. Yeah. And you know what? Is producer? She's great. She's almost as he is. Yeah. What a bitch. Now I got news for a Nick is a prize compared to her. Well, they're up. I mean, Nick wouldn't have wasted all that time. Before they did hang the phone up, but she liked enjoyed ringing, and clawing. Well, I have to get back in there and go on the air. I think I'm going to, you know what? I'm going to do a few minutes. I'm going to call the Swit's Board operator back up. Because she hasn't been there very long. And she's the only one friendly enough to give us the real info. There you go. Because when I said I hear he's sitting in the world on a fire, how's the show? He's like, pretty good. Pretty, but like you can tell the way she's said it. Like they're not, you know, knocking the doors at the golden gate Bridges down there. I'm seeing it? I heard there's a rumor that he's going to be doing the show with the live studio audience from Alcatraz that they're going to reopen it pretty soon. That's a good idea. That's a great idea. I paid a lot of sad. You know, Roger Craig is a big as come back as Bennett. Why would you say that? Just because he's got a big snows like Joey. I mean, he's a good buddy of Don Zimmer, so he can't be all bad even though he's a boy. He's a boy and guy. He don't show someone up at the off start game. Beforeing guy, and he brings out his own guy, Bradley, to lose the game for Crane Island. That was pathetic. Anyway, let's not discuss baseball. Okay, my team is one two games in a row where she were just a glowing in the aftermath of another great victory. And we're doing it boy. We're only 16 games behind it about, I think, 15 under 5, 1400. What's wrong with that? I'd rather watch the cubs on a bad way. We're full game ahead of the cartels and the hottest race in the nation league. We're a full game ahead of St. Louis. What do you want from us? Yeah, you don't mention the cardinal, huh? Well, I'd like to mention him a lot. Just remind everybody that they're a lot worse than we are. And then, of course, there's the aces who are like 19 games under 500. Or no, 23 games, I think. Well, listen, can you give Bennett's new address on the air at that radio station, so I can send them a picture. Just send it to Alcatraz, Silent San Francisco, California, let me get there. 1233 at WIOD, there's an opening in date, 751 Bennett, 751 Alex. Here's a mobile on the IOD line at 10 grand a minute. Yes, good afternoon, how are you, Neil? Pretty good. I have a question for you, please. My wife, finally getting into your show. And I'm taking it this afternoon to get a Corvette. Of course, a white one which you don't like the color. Yeah. I have no idea about it. Wait a minute, who doesn't like the color? Well, it's, you know, standard colors. I didn't get the green or whatever. I'm getting whatever. What most people get? Well, what's wrong with the white one? White, white, Corvettes are beautiful. Okay, well, I have a white Corvette.
