Let's check it out. What they're gonna be. You think they're gonna be upset? Ah! What was it, bro? This is the way I'm at! And a secret word to take! It's... Transvesting! Huh? I'm a skeleton. I'll give that a bottle. Mine is safe. Spend salad thought. For dinner and full lunch. Week. Now here's a good one. Let's talk about Big and High Alia. And High Alia and Sweetwater, Peele would be number one with this kind of stuff. I wasn't good, this is the way I'm at! And a secret word to take! It's... Clock flies! You remember one half if you had a pirate station and played at the High Alia right? And about 10 grand a bet on it? You think this mobile steer here on the starline? I'd have. Yeah. I think it's a chance with your show much of a yesterday. Yeah. You bad girl. Great show yesterday. Yeah. Marked down eight and a half points. Did anybody call? Did anybody call about money, nice football? What about it? Did you see it? No. You missed a lousy game with real lousy official. Yeah, we know. Yeah. That was probably the worst I've ever seen. Ever. Yeah. You didn't miss it all, huh? I had no interest in it. Why would I watch the... I knew the bangles would beat the crap out of the bronze. Why watch it? It was a very... two very boring teams. There was a boring game, but the officiating was exciting. Yeah. That's what I heard. I heard took them five minutes to figure out what Donna was. Yeah, that was one part, but then they made up some rules, though, right there. Well, that's good. Trying to make it a little more exciting. Yeah, I guess the rules are now written and pencil. Uh-huh. Anyway. All right, that's not all I had to say. Sorry, I missed it. Yeah. Thanks. Maybe next time. Yeah. Now, Spencer, what do you want? Give you what? I want to do something. You want to do something to decide on my car with my key? Yeah. Yeah. Key this. I got your key right here, Spencer. You're giving me a copy. Oh, quit acted like such a child. Will you grow up already? You're going to throw you into a way me to do your car, ready, boy? Oh, you. Grow up. When you act like a man, like he said in the godfather, remember Marlon Brando, he slapped El Martino and if he act like a me, man. Grow up, good job. And don't mess up my car Spencer under penalty of death. We'll sit you in Sally, fences cheer for two hours. It's worse than Bundy. Anyways, 1029 and WI would do. We got three calls on the board already this morning. We're off and run and right. We're doing it. We're on the last night speaking of TV. What are we speaking of TV? WIO, you D. They had a thing on the Disney channel. It's probably, I bet you there isn't one person in this audience. I saw once before, but I watched it again. And it was a David Nelson documentary about his brother, about Ricky Nelson. Did anybody see it? Am I the only one in this entire audience in this entire community? You saw it on the Disney last night? It was pretty good. I've been reading for what to say. When you say you're on state, it was nobody else with me. And in the last couple of minutes, they had Rick Nelson's daughter. What is your name? Christy McNickle, Jr. And she's cute. I don't know what she does, but she was on there talking about her dad. And then they had the Nelson twins on there. From this thing was from like three, four years ago. And boy, I said, I had to revive me with oxygen after I saw that segment. Man, unbelievable. It was pretty good, but I'm sure nobody else saw it. And how about the, how about the Randy Martin show? Wouldn't you think if this was any kind of a community at all? Knowing the tremendous popularity of that program that as soon as I mentioned that it like 10-07 this morning, every line should have been lit. Everybody in this audience should have been critiquing that show last night. Stick, carry the desert, and don't give our amounts. Okay, but they don't care. Let's take a call from Boca. Hi, New York. How you doing? What are we going to do with those women in the locker room? What are you going to do? I'm not going to do anything with them. What about you? I don't know. What should we do with them? Well, if the cart would have killed up again, I could have told you, but it hasn't killed up yet. Okay, where I got something for you, now? I'm listening. Okay, well, that's from bank, was it? Let's go to a dear field beach, shallow. Yeah, I was, uh, the final thing. I don't know about the double standard of justice. That was Stein's column today. Now, during the tent thing, he wouldn't obey the judge, but he's going to obey the judge until I've crew. Right. But there's another article in there about J. Leno. How he gets his material for his books from the newspaper. Oh, God. Hey, Atlanta. On the front page of the Sunsetment. What is this story with J. Leno? I read the listener, J. Michaels, and he's not even on anymore. Yeah, the lantern, J. Judd, comedian. Terrible. Awful. But it's never said a funny thing in his life. But there's a big headline on the front of the Sunsetment. It's a command that they know it's real, uh, not my narrative. Yeah, but I'm a map. Yeah, they killed a bunch of Palestinians yesterday to get even. They just still, you know. Yeah, but they're right over there. They put the sections at a back page, and there's a full page ad by L. L. Come, stay with friends. Yeah, right. And I just thought that. That's ironic. Yeah, my mother yesterday says to me, she's employed tourism's really hurting over there. So that's a real surprise. That's a shock. I understand Bay Root and doing too good either. The day we would help him. Why, you know, it's just. And how about the Saudis, man, they hear a Saddam Hussein goes in and he rips the whole country Apart in Kuwait here. Just devastates, crashes, a whole country. Let's kill all these people. Destroy the whole country. That way, hey, listen, we'll give you a little piece. We got Marty Hall was on the front on the way. We got plenty, maybe we got. Howdy Hall was on today with Joe Dodge, yolo this morning. He's coming back on NBC. Maybe he can be the negotiator. Funny, huh? Yeah. He's already doing it. Nobody's well. Yeah, I know, but I mean, he's already on. Back temporarily. He said they brought it back to a give it a big sendoff. Yeah. It's called. He looks like Rick Weaver. He got the same that white here. Now he looks just like Rick Weaver and Dragog. I've been worried about his own chair with him too. That's why he's always standing up on it, Show because there's only one chair he'll sit in. Listen, and as far as Iran, he goes, I guess if no one here is no one can come in. Now there were people listening. Believe me. And I don't want to hear from that one guy, her son-in-law, who I think is a cause of the, oh, he's so great. I want to hear some honest answers, you know? I can see it's going to be, we had a great Monday this week for some reason. And then yesterday was pretty active, but today's Wednesday, and they're just not going to play the game. They need to know what? I don't care because I feel great today. I feel outstanding. I don't know why. Probably because the game is true. Probably because the blinds are closed in the control. And I can't see boy gear here. And I don't even close. I like it much better this way. You can't feel great because it's true. Who? Yeah, the favorite day, sir. The elevator. Okay. We don't talk hockey on this show. 1033 in WIOD. We got three lines. Let I'm not going to love big for calls. We give the numbers today, because I feel outstanding. And of course, say an ad. Look at day. Nothing. Zippity doodah. Okay. We love you too. I still away. Go get on the rubber wrap. Adios. We got your passport right here, pal. We have a. Now what does that mean? I was going to take the break, but I'm so fascinated. I don't want to lose that call on six. Hello. Hello. Yes. Is this Neil? It says, fast. Thema, a lot of board. That's what George wrote about you. What makes you spastic? Neil, I wanted to tell you. I always thought you were a ditch bag. I'm like, wait. I forgot to be listening to you. And now I think you're wonderful. Isn't that something, huh? Isn't that a mess? How your boyfriend can kind of change your direction. Every day of my life. Yeah. Up, down backwards. Yeah, that's what we heard. Are you going to be okay? Oh, my think so. So Neil, how about some stuff? Well, that in a couple more life she used to be a airplane propeller. What is it? We don't have any tickets to give away. That's what the audience is waiting for. They don't want to waste their call down because they figure out playing. I got nothing to give away today. I'm not buying the audience anymore, but if I had, I'm giving you in your boyfriend. How about some food? I got your food right here, baby. What do you want? There she goes. That's it. She couldn't handle it, okay? Fine, I was pretty good. But that's about as a bravest she could get for today. Look at that. Two calls on that whole board. Are you ready? And guess what? We got this whole thing cute up here. No, I wouldn't have written else to get him out of there. He's not feeling too good. He was great. Nobody saw that either. Nobody is in anything today. Okay? Then bother me. We got all of Rick and Sud's material right here. How about this one? Just a second. Stick the room that doesn't... Coming soon to a theater near you. He's been on the road with YouTube for 12 years. Blang guitar and writing songs. But you really miss his mom. And only she gets a postcards from the edge. Dear mom. How are you? I am fine. Wish you could write back. I don't have an interest. I don't have an interest. I'm where the streets have no names. Long the edge. A film inspired by the genius of YouTube's The Edge's writings. It's postcards from the edge. Dear mom. Sponsors at church. Since you were Trump when your name meets me. Hopefully Edge. We asked busy schedule ahead. Book through Christmas. All is quiet on the ears day. Week. Really, week almost as week as YouTube's music. Oh man. That's what I've missed about having stand on the ear the most. Okay, stands a great guy. But his taste in music on a scale of zero. The best. Oh, no! It's blurry. Right? Yeah. Uh, Randy March sucks. Wow, listen. At least he was right to the point, okay? I like people who are direct and don't beat around the bush. Anyway, it's 19 to 11 of good old W. There's only one Frank Sinatra. And now, Crapco introduces his latest live album. Perfectly, Frank. This one goes out to that crazy Irish broad. Shine head on cut. He gets stranger every night. She's taking chances. As a whole, he's taking chances. He's taking chances. He's taking chances. He's taking chances. He's taking chances. This is our anthem fight. I got the answer. Stand at the broad back home. Maybe she'll change her tune. Oh, blue eyes tells it like it is. Shine head, go, shine head, go back. Where you belong. He's the chairman of the board. And you will be too. When you hear perfectly Frank. She shapes her heads. He's morning, eddy. And she don't even think that the star's final banner. To greet. Sting, curial, the desert. And don't give her a message. It's why I'm Sinatra. Live, live, and perfectly planned. I think the sub-baby will all crash. Today, baby, no one confessed to you. Thank God. Okay. 1117 in WID. Can't wait for that Larry King special? I'm sure that everybody in Asante, it's his on the edge of their seat. Roger brought me in the thing I have no idea what magazine this is from a clipping. All about Larry King's NBC special. This Sunday 28th man is that going to be greater what? And Larry says it's a shame that variety shows have gone out of style. Well, a special change all of that. They ask he says, I don't know. I've been in the industry 30 years. And the big secret is nobody knows a damn thing. I remember doing that. That's what he says. Boy, you're going to miss that or what, huh? God, you could dance to Kazaski right on his shnaz. Easy. Miami. Hello. Hi. Hi. I'm a first time caller. We visited your Randy for a little while last night while I was wandering last on the turn pie. She was great. What did she do? She was tremendous. Yeah. Something that you had to be there. She was talking about a letter that she received air mail from the Bahamas. A pornographic letter by a gentleman who described his body in great detail. And she was going to save it as evidence. So I think we need to hear this. She was going to save it as evidence. Oh, what? I don't know. She wanted to let the guy know that she was going to save it. Yeah. She's saving it all right. Well, I could only get her blood. Then I switched over to Jerry Wittner for a moment. I had a radio accident. Yeah. But he was talking about something that maybe you know about that one time I got ran over him with the truck. Oh, I wish. He was saying that it really happened that a guy called him and threatened him. And then when he was leaving work that night, he was actually run over by a truck. Couldn't happen to when I was your guy. I thought so too. I'd like to see that comedian, Rugga, his changing color that night. I can't imagine. How old is he anyway? Which near 163? I thought so. Unbelievable. He talks about all that time. He was in the war. He's talking about the Civil War. Exactly. I don't have to tell you which side he was on. Oh, no kidding. Yeah. Back to the slave days. That's why he likes driving that dicksy highway. Yeah. And if you catch my drip. What does he call this motorcycle? Does he have a name for his motorbike? Oh, it's a crotch rocket. Crotch rods? Yeah. Crotch rockets. Hmm. Why would he get to be that old? I guess it starts sitting in, you know? That's our guy. So anyway, I guess Jerry and Randy are neck and neck. So to speak. Knows to nose. If Jerry was on against Larry King, they'd be nose to nose. I don't know. Mommy's $50. Right. Well, you're going to watch that show Sunday night. The Larry King variety show. I don't think I can. Man. Is that going to be a gut wrenching show? Don't need to big dinner Sunday. I had enough of him during this. The Seattle game. I couldn't take it when he was doing the TV thing. Oh, that Ted Turner crap. Yeah. Oh, God. And the sporting events were not bad, but I just couldn't take it. He can do it. May if you want to go on a diet of neutral system isn't enough. Just watch his show. Exactly. It was terminal. Have a great life. You too. Talk about. You have two things. Well, that's a good start. For real. The first thing. The sit-emommy cops. The Latin cops. They're prejudiced against everybody. Stick to him. I'm serious. You see that 7-11 file for bankruptcy yesterday? That doesn't that tell you people at farm stores. You better govern yourselves accordingly and see the handwriting on the wall like Daniel in the Lions then. Let me ask you something. That's what happens when you take out those highly profitable playboys in penthouse and hustler and all those other disgusting, grotesque, wonderful magazines. You start going in a crapper. Okay. So thank heaven for 7-11 going bust. Nobody deserves it more than they do. And those right wing religious nuts from plant city. Okay. That's the first thing. Neil? And Chris Sabode. You ever see Chris Sabode Raymond Berry and Todd from the newsroom together? No. What does that tell you? Go ahead. Okay. Neil. That's the first thing I was upset about my thing. What? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? The cops? Me? The cops? Oh... Guy like chocolate? So dat Knocker is sucks? You're being hindered by a hunting light? the good to the middle of the way. It was a world cup the first time ever. And every time they pull over here, they'll respond to the standards. Four full of full of team for the team for the Latin team. It happened to people to make us wrecked. Half the people. Yeah. I mean, maybe you should have promoted a little bit of soccer. You don't have to do it. Take J.R. at the 1994. The world cup's going to be here. Okay, you feel better? I feel I hope for not to not enforce it. Everyone's going to watch it. I'm about soccer. You feel better? I feel better. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, buddy. All right. We're going to stop. Down tonight. What will you do? Is that dizzy? Is that a bit of a pity? And my thing is not as old as that. But she's sharp as pretty. Oh, I tell you. It's quite a pity. Let's put on a loan on such a secure tip. She got back to the Institute. Shut up. Walk him by the door. And her brand new get-up. She got, she got, she got, she got, she got, called. I follow, and I can't get up. Oh. I follow, and I can't get up. Yo, man. Did I see you in the one time? I'll make sure. No, I've got yo yo yo. Me and the crew used to pilot that blue her. And now she's not allowed to dance. The drone hurra was in a amber land. Make it get commercial. Make a big bunch of. I follow, and I can't get up. I follow, and I can't get up. Calm down, Randy. 1151 at WIOD. Cheryl was nice enough to bring me George's lighter, which he'll never get back. That's it. And I take him home. Miami. Hey, big boy, have that a big Halloweenie. Okay, we got one for you here. Oh, let's go to Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. First time calling. Great. I was like the minion portion that's told to have to listen to Randy last night first. Oh, I see. I told ya. All these closet people are swinging that door wide open and fly. Oh, by the way, can I tell you speaking a closet about a rumor we just heard? A incredible radio rumor sir. You'll be the first one to hear right to your ear. Okay. This Friday, the massive changes at WI news, the talk disappears and the music starts alleged. Uh, a rumor. Ha ha ha, that's a set in a radio. Yeah. Anyway, I think. Now it's Rand Tell and Montevati and Stereo doing it together. The, uh, I listened to her last night. I'm not sure, but I think this was the topic of that even. And a market's up four points. It was exciting. Which superhero can have sex and which couldn't? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Was her top top discusser. Robert Manley is pretty good. Plastic man. I think she went and she did. Robert Manley would have been a lot easier. I think she found interest in the four superheroes. The one that was on fire all the time. She said something like she would like to get hold of him. But I wasn't sure that she'd like to get hold of anything. Uh, I think she attacked one of the fire hydrants up on 79th on a way to work. Yeah, it was embarrassing. I've never been to a, uh, Kansas game. Anyway, we can get those, uh, take it. No, I'm just way, please. No. Ha ha, good try. Bye bye. See, if you ask for the tickets, that's a guarantee. I hang up on you immediately because you should know that we don't do that. The way we do the tickets is we get all the lines filled, which works every time. And then when I'm ready to do, I'll get out my little bag. Let's see if we got my sack in here just a second. Oh, yeah, we get out our real classy paper bag. It's got our little eight numbered slips in it. We pull out a number, whoever on that line gets a tickets for the hurricane panther. And now we'll say this when we give the dolphin tickets is a little more a hysteria on a line. George is busy punching around so he's not answering this line whoever it is, are you there? Yes, I am. Do you want to hold? Yes. Yes? Are you sure? Okay. Let's go to a plantation. Yes. Here. Yeah. There, who the hell are you? The pizza's drawing people's lines like the landing. Where is it?

She just wanted to talk about Benjia and have a nice time. And she was great. So after the break, we'll do the thing with the tickets. Again, I told you we could milk this for about another hour. Trust me. Right? You bet. 1226. And WIOD. As far as that old fart that called about Randy Martin and about my destroying her life, isn't it interesting? She came in here like a vulture like a Burakuta after Stan Major's job. Right? Is Stan here anymore? I don't hear this guy touch you about poor Stan. He's got a family to raise and feed over there in plantation. Who's dying over there? Dying on the vine, desperate for work, starving to death. And here we got this Burakuta with her hair up like a thing, a bun on the run. And she's on there and she could put her towel at an ankle and have room for all of mosquitoes and so on for a leftover. I don't hear it. I can't handle those people coming here like vultures and stand over your shoulder in a way to get somebody else's job. I'll hold cheese and heal the hair. Excuse me, Rick. 1227, a WIOD, four-laterdale. I just call it tell you, I didn't listen to Randy last night. Thank God, that's why you saw like you're in a good mood today. Why do these people make these mistakes over and over again? They're on that these radio accidents. Everyone who's that's you must have bigger numbers than you, everyone who listens to you. Call it, listen to her. No, but two-thirds. Oh, that's good. You got a point six. Point six? Special. So anyway. So anyway, I don't want to take a breather. Good. So, can I have them? No. We just gave them away. So? We got something for you. You know what it is? Dialto. 1227. And WIOD, let's go to Carl Springs. Good afternoon, Mr. Skinny, how you doing? OK. This is an option. I'm sharing the road today. What is the celebrity? You're sharing? I'm sharing the name for a guy. Yeah. A celebrity. I was driving down to Turnpike at the Joe Robby Stadium. Yeah. Coming up to the whole group. I'm looking good like this. What's that? You seen Jackie Mason lately? Why are you talking like this? Oh, I don't know. OK. Now I rolled up next to the include a horn, but you made sure you look straight ahead. Oh, yeah. Yes, I. Why wave to you, sir? Are you dead? Yeah. I said you're number one. I was in that yellow. That yellow be there. The one? The yellow cap. Stingering the desert. Oh, man. Don't give her. I thought that was pretty good time in the audience. Oh, yeah. The Joe Robby Stadium. And at the pole booth, all the same time. People are starting to talk. I thought that was incredible. It was great. I have a good one there. On the same to you. Her, man. It's almost empty. The door. And from where I sit, you can look out in a hallway where the mailbox is there. And Mr. Executive is out there with his suspenders. Oh, geez. Marvin with suspenders. Man, you talk about a complete sellout. This guy used to be just like a regular one of the guys. Okay, used to come in late every day. He just a general pain in the ass. I don't know attention anything. Now he's a superstar with suspenders. Hey, Marvin. He's got to be a something. Only assholes were suspenders. Okay. And if you don't believe me, go into our programming office right now. Take a look at our illustrious PD. Suspenders. Man, they went out with high button shoes. Are you kidding me? Unbelievable. He's in there like dressed up like Lord Fauntler Rye with suspenders like Mr. Executive. Yeah, one yeah. Why should we go? Why should anybody spend millions and millions and millions in dollars to build a new stadium when we already have one in a great location when they put in the retractable seats. It's fair to be tremendous. Okay, granted at the point, however, Neil, have you ever sat in the Joe Robby's bands? Not in the air condition press box on your ass. Yes, I have. I sat in the first game. Yeah. You know how unfairly hot it is there? Well, let me ask you this. My psychotic friend baseball. What if they played almost all night games? Oh, is that right? Yeah, that's what a lot of teams do. They play night games like in Texas. Play night games on Lake Listern and by crack rocks on the way out of the stadium. Oh, you know, it was really rough. Get now there. Thursday night. I thought it was going to have be mobbed by 40 Crackley. They're stopping the car. Sir, you're just a negative jerk. And here's this one for life. W. L. Y. Death. Man. You're a part of the select segment of the software to population that's been chosen to participate in a research project on radio leasinging. Your opinion is important and will help shape the type of programming that's offered to the software to radio audience. Your assigned station is W. L. Y. F.

Who the hell are they kidding? What a bunch of crap, okay? 152 at W. Y. O. D. I understand also the coast. They spent chickens and billions of dollars. They sent this expensive mail around three colors with all this crap about what do you like and what are your three favorite records and is Johnny Darka Slob and all this other crap. And they got that TV spot that's on in the Jorabi Stadium eight million times a game. And it's on during the news at least 400 times a newscast every station. And it's been a billions of dollars. It's unbelievable. What do we get over here? We get a billboard with 16 ugly teeth like Chicklets. That's what we get. We're still kicking hands. Bubble. Hey, my green girlfriend, are you okay? Oh, my God. Remember me? How you doing, does he? Good. What's happening? We're doing it. You know, my name is Defa Loe here and he looks like a joke or a joke. I'm really, he's having a meeting with the de sheriff Navarro. Uh-huh. Because the de sheriff, he can't read the vault in little boys and girls here in Broward. And then he got rid of Horned. Now he wants to get rid of all the communities. So he's asking for a joke, I'm really, what? And if he told him, it goes coffee, anyway. Yeah. So it's coffee? Okay, you break it up, pal. See, audio is such the way to go. Ask the maniana. Oh, look at that. Look at this. Woo! Suspenders at all with a tie. With his, uh, Kmart suit, unbelievable. What's shopping with the way in our room for clothes today? Oh, God. So when a guy with a suit and suspenders comes up to you and wants to stick 14 water melons in your pants, you'll know who it is. On real, I can't believe this guy. He's consorting with the management now. And I want to be one of those. He's been an underlying lawling about now. He wants to be one of those management types. He wants to be Mr. Hot Shot pretty soon in a lab as on office. Miami. If I had to stability, I kick your ass down and throw him, sell your teeth. Okay. Here's a mobile on the starline. How you doing? Great. Listen, uh, the bunch of cops on motorbike of on 595. And I was just driving down 95. Ascle coming off. You play him something? Why? You play him something? You. If we had time, we'd play him something. Okay. Have a great life. We don't have time to play that now. Can you share the shows almost over?
