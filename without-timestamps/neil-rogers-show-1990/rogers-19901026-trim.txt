Would you like to call us at the ticket station Go get the fucking Go Won't you take that plane? God bless excited all over Five and one. To side 앞 to whether we're but the way's not going to be some score is. So, we lost our mids and two persons. Really, Rona, who had really electrified his crowd with just his second moment of year, but it was a tremendous shot. I don't want to be alone. We're helping making the room now. Well, kind of shows you up, doesn't it? Man, isn't kind of appropriate that it's wintery and cold and blustery? We have the flowers here. We want to thank Darby's floral shop, Mike Uspelger in oral springs for sending some beautiful flowers for the occasion. So, and to be WMRZ, what does that stand for? Memory? Memories? Memories? Oh, boy, what memories? Well, it's kind of a solemn day because it's official now. It's disappeared right? They just like reaching in there and grabbing it right off your radio. And was that something to watch some of the news cast last night to Mariahokell News? And there was a Sally and Penny just spinning around like twin radals with their 14 stars. With their 14-second story, they kept promowing the hell out of it about W's news and then when a story finally came on it was like about 14 seconds. And I thought they were going to break down. It's the end of an era. Oh, yes, oh, it's an end of an era. And then Dwight Lodderdale with the silly news over on Channel 10. I want to make a comment to you, people of Channel 10, you suck. Okay, you really do. And I've always said that and they do. I mean, there's grandma doing the news and there's Dwight looking like a silly goose. Look like the Chessor Kacher can from Alice in Wonderland. And he goes out about, oh, yes, it's a sad day. No talk to listen to any more. There's no talk. And then even one coat text who called me, I think twice yesterday, not just once, keeps bugging a crap out of me. He writes in here about WNWS was the last issues oriented English language talk outlet in the Miami Fort Lodderdale area. Wiod is a line of a talk host, but their programs are what the industry calls topicless talk dominated by entertainment, novelty songs and gags. Yeah. Gag this one. Is it interesting how some of these people define what talk radio is? Of course, they've met as usual, I miss the whole point. And that is things evolve, things change. And it's that geriatric so-called topic oriented talk. That's what's dying. And when WN calls me yesterday, he's saying, well, you know, these syndicated shows like Bruce Williams in this. I said, wait a minute, Bruce Williams doesn't do topical talk. He had to give us people answers to their problems. He's his call a lawyer. So if you want to hear everybody else's problems for two or three hours, that's what he does. And even the king at our, he didn't do topical talk. He just kisses but for like five, six hours every night. It's dead. It's dead. And I have a list here as we're preparing for later on today's activities and festivities. And it's noticed that my friends in the afternoon have like milked this. Three shows they've gotten out of this and they never even worked there. They don't know anything about that place. They don't even know where it is. And they've appropriated me to write in the herst today and go Yiske Dalvi Yiske Daesh or may Raabbo how long does that take? I can do that in three seconds to say cottage for that place. And I'm going to stick around here, although I will say, a Diane's coming in to give me a haircut at one o'clock. So I look real good for this. Would you please remind me to have her cut my eyebrows. I feel like Andy Rune on a bad day and he's not one of my favorite people. Anyway, I've made a list with the assistance of Mitch Ween who also of course worked at WS News. I've compiled a list of names. What a list. And I'm sure the audience will help out. Maybe even owl will call in this morning. Unlikely, maybe Steve will call. You know what I need Steve to call and watch the bat line. George, George didn't pay attention. We need Steve to call. And I'm sure he's listening waiting for us to promote a show again on WFTO which starts a week from Monday from 2 to 6. Hey, listen, competition is good. It's healthy. That's what Y100 says. Of course we saw that article in the paper again. Will Wiod let go of the dolphins never know chance. If it strangles them to death, if it cost them a hundred million dollars a minute. They'll never let go of it because it's like, would join at the hip. It's like surgically sealed. And it works the other way around too. The robbies will never let go of Wiod and Mr. Weaver trust me when I tell you. Did I tell you last night, third round? So I gave you the wrong guy. But I gave you the right round for the fight. Nobody's perfect. What do you want? Everything you want the right round and the winner? You're nuts. That's like I'll give you winner today at the call or fourth race. I can't tell you the horse, but I know the race. Yeah, with a purple sash in the schmothi on. Anyway, after we do a break, I need this. I started to say Steve to call in his girlfriend Robin from Orlando. I know the first name I don't know what her last name was. He brought her down. She did a little show on the weekend. I'll shoot it, but I can imagine. So Steve, you can probably help out because there were see what these people are talking about the end of an air round. All I said, what they don't understand is that once Sudbring sold the station and the Casper was gone in the old crowd. It wasn't ever the same. It was like a whole different ball game than rock off near rock off bought it, a really strange guy who started to destroy it. And then of course, if anybody can really put the final nails in the coffin, Jefferson pilot came on after they blew WGS out of the water and turned it in. The water and turned it into Espanol when they sold it to radio mom B and they came over. They just absolutely decimated it. They created an audience that was post death. And you notice the interesting thing about them. Well, they're whining and all they're fetching the other day and all they're done is Collins with his waxing all eloquent about his audience. And they're out there, but they're all enough of them. The same remedies always with that company. They just kept shutling the deck. GBS did the same thing. They had David Gold and they had Beth Smith and they had Lee Fowler. What they would do when they had no numbers. They'd move them all around to different time periods. They kept shutling the same deck around in different parts of the day. And guess what? They still didn't have any numbers. Oh, you know who I left off the list? The Dean. The Dean, how could we leave him off the list? He was on GBS and WS News. And Gretchen Graham? Mitch reminded me, oh, boy, if I got a list here, this we could kill all show with this. And I mean, kill. What a list. Is Steve gonna call in and give me Robbins last name? Also, we had a newsman. When we first went on here in the old WFAB Studios on Flagler Street. After WFU and went dark for a month, we had a newsman named Al, something his last name I think began with a G. He was Italian. And he inject McCoy, another newsman. He had like a fist fight in the hall. Remember very vividly. We also had our first production director, stabbed, tried to stab somebody with the knife. We had a classy outfit at WFWNWS. And it'd be well, we had to get all those hostilities out of the way in the beginning, so it made for good blood, so to speak. If I got a list. And then, of course, at WS News, when they bought that station and the numbers started going down, the demographics were post-death. They did the same thing. They started moving people around. Alonim Midday, Alonim afternoon, Alonim morning, Debbie and Midday, Debbie and afternoon, Sandy and Midday, Sandy and the afternoon. Compulsive destroyers of radio stations, Jefferson, Pilot, Broadcasting. And now I turn it on this morning. And guess what? The music they're playing is great. The only problem is, it sounds like somebody sticking a microphone up to a speaker. It sounds like, oh, it's a little bit... Excellent music. You just can't hear it. It's like the coast on AM. So anyway, with the apologies to Fleetwood MacRover, it's 117, oh, it wouldn't be nice. 1017 at WIOD, and we'll be right back to continue with these incredible memories. I bet you the audience is going to help us out. Are you back? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? Dennis? He'll be on there. 1017 at WIOD, we got the flowers here too. They are beautiful. God are they great. They've gotten a little, a little on top, a little bow, and it says, rest in peace. By the way, Paul Robinson. How could we forget him? What the hell was his name? I have him. My Bob Robinson, we used to call him, Boorda. He used to have his finger all the way up to his brain. I don't think he was used to be used to say he was digging for dollars. I'm serious. How'd you like to sit for four hours every day? And watch someone pick their nose all day. Every day. It's a good thing we didn't use to eat on the air in those days. Man, I could have waited about 40 pounds by the end of that experience. It's, well, just think about it. Okay, not too appetizing. Ten 18 at WIOD. And we'll be right back. So anyway, as we continue with this incredible experience, while I can't stop playing it, I'm sorry. I'm obsessed. I'm an ex-boy, I want to go out to a pawn shop by a 357 magnum. Take the ribbon from my head. Just let her say turn her blue. What's your blue shirt? There we go. Anyway, it's a 1021 at WIOD. So that's what we want. We want some people who can out the end to our list today. If you got some of the memories of the greats in the near grades from WNWS, I was there from the day they went on the air in the old WFAB studios on Flagler Street. It was incredible. And don't like you've never seen March of 1978. To the end of December of 1983, I was there for six long, incredible excruciating years. I could write a book. I really could. On, be livable. You think I'm making it up about the production guy with the switchblade? I'm not. Try to knife somebody the first week we were there. And the fist fights in a hallway. And the old newsroom with all those pictures of Sean Cassidy posted up there on a wall. I won't tell you who put them up. That would be embarrassing. But it would be fun. And the battles of the talk show hosts. And I'm going to read the list of names a little later on. And then this afternoon when we do that thing, I guess I have no idea what that's all about. But I guess if we go through with that, we'll kind of read these off in memoriam. May it rest in peace. WMRZ, memories. That's going to be the new call letters. Are we not, well, that's in the paper somewhere, isn't it? Okay, let's take a call from Miami Beach. Hello. Are these people on here as they board on? Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes, Neil. Guess who's going to be at the Wild Wake Party today at 4 p.m. How many guesses do I get? About two. Moishi Puppek. Wrong. Okay. One more. Ellen Morphonius. Wrong. Gilbert will be there. Oh, I knew. Gilbert claims he is going to lead the funeral procession to the WNWS building. Great. So if anybody really wants to come down and see him. No, if anybody wants to come down and bust him, excellent. Thank you for this call, sir. Let's alert the pigs. Let's get his ass in jail. Right. Thank you, sir. Great job. 10, 23. Because I'm not going on that property. I'll tell you that right now. Melvin and others. And if that hurts, start going on there. Parking out. I'm jumping out. I'll go over to Taco Bell. Because knowing Dennis Collins and loving him the way I do, I just don't want any part of that. You know what I'm saying? It's a little cold. Yeah. But this fall. They don't get your skin. And of course, there are a lot of people out there. Don't even know what they're all about. They don't know. They don't know. They don't know. They don't know nothing. Including the guys in the afternoon here or making a big gussong of the dance about this Rick and Dud. They don't know nothing about it. But they're sure doing a good job of milking it for all its worth. I'll say that. Speaking of milking it as a milky way, Mitch Ween came up with a few good names including Kathy Walker, who was a rather rotunded secretary. Very nice young lady. Fat. And Kathy had her desk. And I guess she's like envelopes and different things in there. And every ever we're going for a piece of stationary and envelope. And just load open a certain drawer and Kathy Walker's desk. They're all these empty, Clark bar rappers. Hundreds of them. Stuffed in there. She used to hide the evidence. Jailions of them. We just come like falling out all over the place. We love you, Kathy. I'm the Cebo. Our first traffic lady. Susie Shortskirts. I don't remember your last name, Susie, but I remember those real, real short skirts. The Casper's Executive Secretary. Let's take a call from Boca. Oh, yes, dear Lord. Help us make it through the night. Yeah. Yeah, I'm here, I'm left. Do you know how I shared it? He's been a record. He's been in? He's been in like a drail. Can I ask you a question? Since they're doing satellite all the rest of the day, why are they keeping him? I know he works for a cheap. But what is that all about? Does that make any sense? It sounds right now. It sounds like they want him to DJ. Yeah. Well, I could get on QAM. Yeah. All right. And WGMA and Hollywood don't forget. Yeah. Yeah. And somebody called him last. He's still taking calls. Yeah. And everybody was asking the same question. That's a shadow of Rome. Never sounded that good over there. I'll tell you that they had like a muddy old card of that song. He said these people never treated me so good. And then he turns around and says, But if I say anything out of line, they'll fire me right away. Yeah. Wait, you get this boy. Get me anyway. Oh. That's how they all are. And Tom Snider was advising people with tuna WABC and the South Florida area. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. At a boy Tom. There you go. He was always a day late in the dollar short. But he's another one with good eyebrows. All right. Well, we'll talk to you later. Good Lord willing. Good Lord willing. I'll see you on the Ho Chi Minh Trail. Oh, y'all. 1026. At W-I-O-D. Boy, have I got a list for you here? And he's this is just from my memory. You mean Steve Kane hasn't called in with Robbins last year? Steve, shame on you. How come it is when he wants to promote his show on F-T-L? I'm promoting for me calls in on a bat line. But now he forgot the number and he's allegedly not listening. I guess he's not selling spots. Help me make it through the night. Come on. Somebody come up with a name of that newsman. Anybody calling with Al? The guy's name was Al. And began with a G. The only thing I remember about him is that he got into a fist fight with Jack McCoy in the hallway at the old WFAB studios after we first went on the air. Al. I remember Tim and Subaru are second production director, Glenn Houghton, Chris Sloan, Jeff Casauer. Boy, have I got a list here? John. Uh-huh. Levitt. Four-laterdale. Yeah. I don't think Steve can't call him because he got into a head on collision at 295 and I don't know if he's gonna. It means Steve's dead again? Steve's dead again. Oh, geez. Boy, he's died more times. But I'm putting on this station many days. I'm looking for him tonight. I'm going down to the heat game. You're coming down with me tonight, aren't you? Oh, yeah, sure. Right? Whatever you say. Okay. How's everything? Great. Slim trim. Niel. Tell me. What do you think you're as a story on? Yeah. Well, I don't know how to say this. On. I've heard rumors now that they've missed your cane. Is coming back to I.O. Day and he's going to be taking somebody's place over there. Yeah. And if your cane is coming to F.T.L. Why did you get with the programs or week from Monday? W.F.T.L. It is true, then, huh? Yeah. I'm just coming back on to the... Well, you're too far behind for me, sir. Get a little like. 1020, that's a basketball fan. We have an open line in Broward 5249463. We don't have time to muck you around. Do they? We need to get people who've got information. Do we have anybody? Let's go to anything? Is he back on? Is there a make-up place or mine here? Oh, Dennis will stop it. People are starting to talk about you now. Oh, no. Take it like a man. Why did you shut the line up around one more time? Oh. Put your yarn in morning drive. Oh. All right, hold on a second. Kendall. Um, yeah. What about not slamming things? Who do you think did it? Well, I tell you one thing. I don't know who did it, but they sure gave you enough options last night. If you hated Danny like most of us, you got to see him murdered about 30 times last time. Yeah, you think it's someone else, maybe they didn't show? Probably. They're not going to give you. I mean, they're not going to give you the answer. They're just going to titulate you. That's all. And what about Pat Peterson and Michelle Lee? I think there's something going on there. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. What? Talk about getting a little too cozy for everybody. It's about time they finally showed up. And it's about time that Paige went out and gotten on his job, right? Yeah, true. Work and standing up and stood a land down. Yeah. Wait, you get this boy. Get it, re-Anyway. Oh. Now, what were you saying? Oh, I didn't say anything. Oh, yeah. But, um, what about that? Oh, that might be the deld dimension. He's on my list. Oh, oh, there's. Now, there may be maybe you can help me. Were you a W. Newslist or ever? Um, I'm a little bit sore though. No, I don't think so. But there was a news lady. Her name was Arlene something, not Arlene Ross. And she married a news guy named Jerry Ross. Isn't that interesting? So I guess her name is Arlene Ross now. But the newsman's name was Jerry Ross. He was kind of a skinny, real bad dresser. He always came in like sweaty with a t-shirt. And her name was Arlene something. And I need her last name to make. I'm trying to complete my list. I'm just tossing these out because some of our radio groupies in the end, as we'll give us, we'll fill these in. I'm sure. Oh, by the way, I've sort of got a spy report for like month. Just coming Monday night. Mm-hmm. Your chronic radio name, you know? The big G-word is going to be at She's, um, at a verse three celebration up in. Is this Mr. G's wife? No, I said, no, I've been through referring to the big G. You know, the big G is in Gilbert. Oh, Gilbert, I thought I'd talk about Mr. G. Oh, sorry. Gilbert's going to be at why? She is going to have some big, at a verse three celebration Monday night. Is this funny fox going to be there? Oh, yeah. I think he said that he said everyone's supposed to be there. Everyone that ever worked there. And skip Herman? I don't know. Is he in the queen? He said everyone that ever worked there. It's supposed to be there. Wow. Maybe I guess joy will be there too. Yeah. I'm going to say that. Maybe joy will you show us. Wow. And Bill Marshall. It's a one. Okay. Bye bye. Thanks for the info. 1031 at W.O.D. is Gilbert continues annoying people from coast to coast. Do we have any information here? It's going to be pretty disappointing if we don't get any help for my list. Because I think I did pretty well when you consider how old I am in my failing memory. Let's, uh, I'm just going to be a boxing call. Hi, near is my cousin. As soon as I can get cold with a holy man, I want to fight him. It puts cold all over him. But I really, actually. Cute, Mike. 1032 at W.O.D. We have an open line of day, 751, 9463, 751, W.O.D. I like that one too, by the way. Can we get one of those? Oh, God, I can't wait to have our own. I want to tell us his friends who was on a phone just come on. First of all, it says the new WNWS format featuring Patty Page, Perry Como, an Ed King Cole. It said to go on the earth an unspecified time this weekend. So in other words, what they're playing today, which I said was pretty good music. That's not the new format, unfortunately. They're going to be playing big bands like FTL through a strainer. Well, I'm a strainer just thinking about it. I'll tell you that. It's 1033 at W.O.D. Do you think we'll have a little Wayne Arnold today just to celebrate? No? Yes? Let's take a vote. How many won Wayne Arnold today? Okay, it's unanimous. Show on tape. The day before he died? Yeah, either the day or two days before he died. They knew that he was going to die within the week. And they let him do a whole day show to board him back for one day. I didn't know that. Oh, yeah, I got the show on tape. It's great. You know, he didn't say anything. They didn't mention anything about it. And it was two days later that he passed on. That was a little benefit they had done for him. Well, you know, he went up to Nashville with me and Bill Carter into Casper. And I think that's what finally did Charlie in, you know, because he was in a delicate condition to begin with. And he was there a lot longer than we were. He survived through a whole winter up there. And I think that was just such a shock to assist him. I think he ever recovered from it. I thought the three of you would have best things that ever happened to radio. You've been. Back in those great days, boy, we had some great moments. And see all these people like Sally and Lauderdale and all these other jackasses that are tired. They don't even even know what that station was all about because those were the days during Williams. When that station was really hot. Now it was just like a jury-entric funeral parlor. Well, I don't want to take up too much of your time. So how have a very nice day. Thank you, sir. Ten forty two at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in Broward. Look at that. They're flashing like a biorethms. How about Ernie Sochen? Ernie never had a show. He was my guest off and I'm about Tom Jicka. He's out of town for the breeder's cup. Tom had a show. I put him on here myself. He had a radio TV show on Sundays until a Miami news got all his Historical and Howard Kleinberg made him cut it out. Shame on you Howard. Tom Jicka could be a big radio star right now. He could be doing two to six and we're growling me pretty upset about it. Four Loderdale. Robin Raker. Robin Raker. Jennifer Raker. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I'm going to find Robin's. That was the Steve's girlfriend, right? Yep. Jennifer Renn. I even sent him her wedding announcement. Jennifer Renn. I just can't believe it. Have you got more names for me? Uh, that's me. I got her. How about? Was, um, was, uh, Gretchen Graham on there in the morning. I was in her house and Chuck Seasle. Chuck, Chuck Seasle. Was it him Chuck G'dent? Chuck G'dent. Yeah, Dent was the word boy. Were they a pair, huh? Of course they destroyed this place for a while too. Ellis Rubin also had a show. Right. And Marshall Moore. Right. Incredible. Boy, this list is good. I got a list here that I got another sheet of paper. I'm going to pay the board of Randy Martin matching dating in her. Wait a minute. Kathy Sip. Who's that? We're not in here. What is it Randy Morton aborted? What? Matching dating and, uh, guess mating show? How about Neil Rogers mating and dating show for two years under his girlfriend? Absolutely. Oh, no. Not Randy Martin again. Oh. The guy. I heard the last about 10 minutes of the thing. In that time, I heard a cap driver who's never has any time. A bag boy who works about 90 hours a week. Yeah. And a guy who dated a girl who had a bag boy who would go out with Randy and kind of stick the bag over her head. That wouldn't be all bad. A guy who dated a girl for about five years. So he figured out she was no good for it. Hmm. Why do you keep subjecting yourself to that punishment? Hey. When you're out late at night, I guess there's nothing else. Are you serious? I'm not a guy who's on the wall. I'm retired. I forgot about you. I have a great vlog. Good morning. Will it be a place here? Yeah. It's jumping, checking in. It's burning home. It's beddy in from Hollywood. All I'm taking. It's you, Jeff. Yeah. Wave that gutter out, Jared. That's why you're still there. I'm telling you that's the only reason. You notice everybody else gone. The man is still there. The man with the biggest gun in town. Okay. 1045 at WIOD. That's just a figure of speech. Of course. Here's a mobile from Broward. Yeah. The guy's name is Al Lombardo. No. Al Del Greco. Al Lombardo. I got a list. Is that it? No. Al Del Greco was there 12 years ago when we started, sir. And Billy's a douchebag. He don't know anything. Okay. Anyway. Al Lombardo. Of course, a left under very interesting circumstances at WNWS. Got into a screaming shouting fist fight with Don Currence in the parking lot spit in his face. They've had this in pretty interesting episodes over there. How come we don't have any excitement like this? Like when George and Brian are going to get into a brawl about that car, huh? Hmm. Pick on somebody your own size, Brian. 1046 at WIOD. Let's go to Kendall. Hello. What's going on this afternoon? I understand they're rick and sons. We're going to stay in the studio. Why everybody goes out and get to rest for a trust. I have a better idea. I'll stay in the studio and they can go out with Marvin and get arrested with Gilbert. Well, they're not. They're going to stay in the studio and they're going to egg everybody on the cost trouble. And it's going to be a mess. Why is that? Why is it going to be a mess? Well, because the police are going to rest him for blocking traffic. Nobody's going to block any traffic. We're just going to zip on by. That would be a little planet too stone in the in the lawn. Not not this kid. Well, maybe not you, but he's going to have the Marvin's going to do that. Well, that's good. He's going to be arrested. I want to be there to watch. I'll pay the water. Yeah. I'll hire me again. Maybe they can hang him from those suspenders. I would nice day. And they're going to shove 40 pods of butter scots Sunday in a police officer's pants. So how come you get the wrong fighter last night? Hey, give me a break. I got the right round. What does anyone want? Everything? 1047 at WIOD. We have an open line in date. 751 9463. And we become in back. Right after this. 1050 at 610. WIOD. WMRZ. Mamarees. Isn't that something? So the car. It's going to be like it was never there. Like somebody reached into your dial and just plucked it out. Like tearing your heart out. Miami. Hey, New York. You're doing great. I've got a godfather three spy report. I went to the movies and they had the coming attractions of it. That about a 10 minute thing on it. Looks like it's going to be really good. Yeah, that's what they say. But it's not coming out till January or something. Yeah, they had to open up with Michael Corley on. He's like 70 years old. It's Al Pacino. Uh-huh. He's like, they just have the camera on the stage and he's going, I sold all my businesses. I'm legitimate now. Oh yeah, why is he been working on it for a long time? I killed my brother. I killed the cop and everything. Now he's legit. He's so olive oil. And he's talking like Marlon Brando just. Oh yeah. And he's been panning camera out. And he's in the Vatican. He's trying to do business with the church. Uh-huh. And Anthony's all grown up. And he's a band of Garth Seah. And the gripper. Yeah. But you gotta go to the movies and just check out the coming attractions. Okay. All right. You'll take it easy. So I guess I... Well, as of that station, it doesn't do talk. We just play funny gags and uh, novelty stuff, right? Right. Right one. Carlos, co-tex. 1052. At W.I.O.D. here's the not-s landing lady. Ladies and gentlemen. Good morning. How you doing? Okay. How are you? I didn't like it last night at all. It wasn't so good. It wasted the whole show with like 40 different versions of let's step on Danny Cans and uh, you know, which is fine, but a little too much. Yeah, how many times can you see him die? I'd rather seen a lot more of Michael and Michelle Lee and find out what's going on that house. Right? Definitely. They showed us a little bit of pat. And I would have rather seen pat in the towel instead of Tom. Yeah. Any day. Any day. Hello, Tom. It's looking a little bit better. You might actually take a bath this year with you. Yeah. It looks like he might have taken a shower. Yeah. Not too bad. That amazing little barcoast can do for it, especially if you hang on real tight. So yeah, wasn't a very good episode at all. But what we know that what's his name didn't do it. The black eye with the glasses. What's his name? Frank, you know who I think it was his daughter? The daughter? Yeah. Yeah. She's a pain anyway. Let's get rid of her. Let's send her off to reform school. That's what I think. I think it was the daughter. Yeah. I don't like her. She'll took fetchy for me. Right. I figured who my husband said he thought it was. Somebody really off the wall. Anyway. Well, I have to see. This is pointing. Yeah. I'm not sure if you have a bad episode or not planning as better than L.A. Law. By far, we don't worry about it. All those people are claimed to watch L.A. Law are the same ones who claim that they watch Nightline and they're really watching a Carson. Right. Trust me. I believe it. We're all in mourning today. Yeah, it's pretty depressing. I wish I could put on a happy face. But boy, I have this long, long list that's growing by the second. You know, I feel so bad because I never once listened to talk to you. Boy, you didn't know what you missed. Oh, I got a great and important call on the phone here. All right. Well, we'll talk to you next week. Have a great time. You too. See you. Bob Wilde. Hi, Neil. Whose name I left off the list. The wild man. This is the same man who once said to me. If you think I can say you again, stale him, Courtney, you're very easy. Right. Of course, look what happened to Alan Corton. Hey, listen, you know, our lean wolf. There's the name. Oh, my God. I just got it here. Fred shots. I've got that one. What was the name of the guy who was in there? What cardal Rivera? Remember Ricky Rivera. Sure. Yeah. What was the name of the guy who was in the newsroom who was handy cap? Who was Charlie Capis. Charlie Capis. My God. He was the best. Dan Best. Sales managers. I'll be back. Well, there you go. He remembered Bob and I don't remember his last name. His dad owned her bets. He was a boardop. Goalob. Because her goal of owned her bets, so must have been Bob Goalob. Bob Goalob. Yes. And how Bob Gordon's son worked there for about three days until we kicked his ass out. What a pain he was. Bob Goalob. And I'm right now one done. I think that was his name to a junior. Do you know that on the very first ever university of Miami baseball broadcast? I was your only salesman that had any time sold. Really? That's right. Well, we sure went a long way from there, didn't we? Hey, listen, you know. Do you remember the meeting the cast for head? The very first meeting of the staff? Was I there? Yes, you were. He had a soft sitting in this room. It was you. And, uh, Charlie Chan. Alan Rand Till. And while Rand Till was your boardop, wasn't he? No, he was a news flunky. I thought he was a boardop. No. Okay. No. We had the Rawl Sand Son and Larry Wallenstein. Right. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. And, uh, Stan made sure and Mickey Dane and Jerry Wichner. That was the original lineup. And the press can Robinson and Jack McCoy. Okay. They got out of your talking about your memories last week. Del Greco. Al Del Greco. Del Greco. Del Greco. Right. Just he came from P.I.x. in New York. Yeah. Head of Brawl with Jack McCoy and the Hall One. That was great. Where? Yeah. I was also there for the great flood. Yeah, that was the best. Then you were talking about your... My pants rolled up to my knees, waiting for the electric cue to the second. I felt like Ted Bundy on a bad day. Do you remember trying to go outside of the place to find something to eat? Nobody's booking? Yeah. You bet. I know I also remember getting into card midnight every night, not being able to hear the station. Well, that was... That's why it made so hard to sell. What do you think I can get out of the business, R. Hey, listen, you salespeople got all kinds of excuses. But you want to station somebody can hear? Now you're really pushing to the... I went out to talk to a guy about buying the station. He was in... On Kindle Drive and about 170. And I said to him, this new station we're doing all kinds of things. Guys said, let me hear it. And he turned up with me and he couldn't even put the damn thing. Oh, wait a minute, you'll never guess who I have on the phone. See, Bob? Fail. Suzy? Fine. Is this Suzy? Yes, it is. Only it's a Zinn and that's Zinn. Suzy? And what was your last name, Zinn? Padley. Oh, no. Isn't this incredible? Uh-huh. God. Yeah, my boss just came in and said, Zinn, they're just talking about milk. Just talking about you on the air. Yeah. And you're not with you. Unbelievable. I'm working for the Max Garden Brookcast border now, and it's so great. You worked with the Cas for a lot. Wasn't he a great guy? Yep. I can't believe this. He's a Charlie Bum. Even at this point, nobody is written one word. I keep screaming at Juan Coto and Tom Jicket, a writing big story about DeCasper and all the things he didn't radio. And with all this talk about WNWS, they're still not talking about the fact that DeCasper is the one that came up with the concept and put it on the map. I knew it. I remember he and I in his office doing the local. Well, we don't want to talk about that. Yeah. So, as you can see, this is incredible. Yeah. So, you doing okay? Yeah. I'm looking for the Max Garden Brookcast border. Great. Remember those times you got my talent wrong on my checks a couple of times. I was having an nervous breakdown. That was fun. That was fun. I'm Mrs. Sebo. Yeah. And Jean Miller. And Cataclan. Pat Castellanos. There's another name for my list. Great. Is there anybody else in the office there that I should know that used to be there? Do you remember? Oh, let's say. When was it in the sales school? Lynn? Lynn, Fratis. Now, got to go. Lynn Cameron. Yes. Was that her name? Yes. Yeah. Boy, it's all coming back just like yesterday. Great. And Mike Moonshine. And Ellie Gray. And Warren Chevrolet. And Dan Coons. And Larry Lustig. Oh. And. And, buddy. Sozy, it's great here in front of the house. Sozy, it's great here in front of you. Suzanne. Nice. Bacon. Yeah. Sozy Hadley. Unbelievable. Boy, they gave this job to the right man. I'll tell you that. They had to give it to a guy who could handle it. And we're handling it. I'm going to have to get another sheet of paper. That's how long this list is. I mean, that's amazing. How come Dave Lemont hasn't called in yet? Has he busy over at Highlight, Dave Lemmon? Come on, Dave. Quit screw it around. And Dave Lemont, crandston. Come on, Dave. We know you're listening. Boy, cheers. Uh-huh. If John Levin calls in, I'm just going to, I will just, I'll spin around in this chair like a Dradle and heat for about an hour. If John Levin calls in, wouldn't that be something? So we can hear about his friends and the Jewish community and his friends and the black community and his friends and the straight community. Uh-huh. Anyway, we're going to take a deep breath now because I didn't realize what a pressure pack day. I may now, I may break down before this is uh, that's alright. We can play both music at the same time. Kind of sound like W.M.R.S.D. Anyway, now Henry Barrow is standing by speaking of memories.

Congratulations, Henry. Thank you sir. You're a great American. I agree with you. He's seen him come and go. Lots. In fact, that would be a good show when they will have Henry. We'll make a list. You'd have to start now. We'll give you about six months of all the people that have come and gone. Including the management people. Wow. Twenty six years. Can you imagine? From Bill Vyance and Bob Rich and the Assassin and everybody in between. Has he seen him come and go or what? Oh, way back. But they still won't let him in the ball game. That's right.

Do we have a problem? It looks like you're having an nervous breakdown over nothing. I mean, just a little one. Let's go to Hollywood. Nobody there. I probably somebody from W.G.MA and Hollywood, no doubt. Hi, Alia. Hello. All these people gone? Are they all gone? What a shame. Ports ain't loosey. Neil. Yeah. Did you have the catch a last hour of Dick and Pardy yesterday? The last hour, no. Okay. I guess you'll be surprised to know that you're going to be riding with two of the least talented celebrities in town in your profession. Who's coming beside Marvin? Let me give you a little hint. What do you have when Steve Canyon Alex Bennett do a remote together? I'm waiting. Two live Jews. Oh, they're going to be involved in this? Of course. I'm not going. Are you serious? Yeah. I'm not going. They're in it. Okay. Hey, I'd like to come. I'm not joking. I'm not going to be, if they've invited them to go. I mean, what do they talk about exploitation? What do they have to do with W's news? Other than Jews, rhymes with snows? I think they invited themselves. Well, I'm not going. Hmm. I'm not. Good. I got better things to do, okay. In fact, Marvin go over there and get arrested by himself. Let all these people have a little parade. Don't even know what it's all about. That's the thing that amazes me. I mean, talk about milking my material. All these people are going to be involved in this. They don't even know where it is on a dial or was. You better talk to your, uh, follow up boys there coming off. About what? No, I just told you I'm not going. I've been looking for an excuse anyway, but I'm not going. I figured that would feel it. Okay. I don't think we call it Governor Bible big lottery bag. Okay. Thank you very much sir. You're welcome. Give me my out. Now they don't need me. They can go ahead. I already said, yes, could I? I should be a robber, which is the Jewish prayer for the dead. We said, cottage, shit. So, and that's it. And if they want to have a big thing over there, I'm not going to muscle in on their show. Let them do their thing and I got business take care of. It's 11 after 11 at Wild. We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655, 9463, 655, Wild. See that, that would be an out Gilbert. It's going to show up. See I have nothing to do with that and that bothers me. And there's some things that just are inappropriate. Gilbert is nothing to do with that place. It needed his Eric Lambert, but there's some people that just want to muscle in. And everything, that's fine. That's their stick. So, I'll do my thing and they'll do theirs. Never the twain shall be, right? Exactly. I'm going to go over her. I'm going to go over her. I'm going to do what's to you. And she'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. She'll go. Oh, God, Sammy, I tell you. He could hold the ball as well as he can sing.

That'll kill like at least a half an hour. The staff didn't say Rick and put. Patrimee to the passing of W. Snue's with a wake and a funeral featuring special guest Ulajizer, Neil Rogers, Mayday Snue's and Pays. Well, I don't know. I'd have my dance. Why don't we let the boys do it, huh?

Oscar says равrabs and in 76 Chris Mars was a little funky. Yeah, now he's a reporter on the field. Now Craig Sagar is also on ESPN. I worked with Craig at WSPB in Sarri Soda, 1973. And now about Lynn Russell from the canto's on the line. Nice. How are these famous TV stars? Neural arrestivists are just sucking around here in Miami. How about the only person ever to get me to shut off the radio fascist Steve Kane, friends, Tina Thomas? Got it. Hi, you're doing Thomas, Tina? Why does everybody call her Thomas Cena? I don't know. I don't understand that. Yeah. Unlistened. And this guy I don't know, Gregco? Yeah. He's now kicking for the, he's a playscicker for the cardinal. Correct. You knew that. Well, he's moving up in the world. Well, he's doing great. Yes, sir. Okay, that's all I have to add. Thank you. 11 17 is we say at WIOD, thanks for the memories. WMRZ. Namarees. So evidently, what you're hearing over there now is not the new floor mat. It's just kind of like, um, I don't know why are they doing that? I guess they ran out of Beatles records. Are they, we're going to be playing Peggy Lee in that coal and big bands. Is that really what they're, oh, god, my skin is like creeping. It's like I want to just unzip something on my body and just peel all my skin off. I feel those red ants just all over my body. Ron St. John Jr. ladies and gentlemen, tribute part two. Oh, these you boom boom. They're taking a loose. We're not going to tribute at WIOD. They're here. Tony Fisher, ladies and gentlemen, the big hurts. Yeah, that's probably one of the songs you'd be hearing when we start the new floor mat. It's 11 18. Let's take a call from Hialia. Hi, how you doing? Great. What about that fight last night between Buster and Holyfield? I gave you the round pal. That took a $50 from each one. Yeah, I'm told me Buster and the first round and the other one told me Buster by a split decision. Yeah, well, tell them both bust this. That's what I said. You bet. What about that Randy Martin show at night? That shows past that. Oh, no, not Randy Martin again. Oh, that show fuck. Do you like it? Have a great day, sir. Did we say one more quick? Number one thing. Is there Charles lives? Hey, you're a douchebag. Okay. Thank you. 11 19, a lot of very emotional people. Doesn't even feel like Friday. Doesn't feel like it at all. And you can be sure that I'm going in a care of and a day. I'm just trying to play hard to get. I wouldn't miss it for all the tea and China. I just don't want to be in the same house with Eric Lambert. Is that okay? If I have to ride with those guys, I'm not going. That's that is definite. The unmitigated golf for them to invite themselves to come along and the muscle in on this to try to get some more free publicity. After all, they've done to repay us with their gratitude. Screw them. They're about as funny as the cancer of the kneecap. Fort Lauderdale. Yeah, yeah, how the mighty have fallen. The eldest is Mike Spindell. Mike. Yeah, I told you brought up. This is my wife and on a freezing phone booth. This isn't my spend. No, it is my spend. But it doesn't sound like you must really be freezing. Well, it is. It's very cold. You hear your name is on the list by the way. I was at you had ought to be on the list several times. You worked there all day about 16 times. How about K. Pulfimov. Got him. Bob Berger. How about Dave Lemon and Dave Lamont. How about Mort Lubo. You got Drew Hayes? Drew Hayes, you bet. And how about you get the kicker. The newsman he was talking about is. And how do I correct what's out the meco. The meco. Well, I was close. There we go. The meco. Now we're talking. How about how about. How about Mike Zimmer. How about her. He's on the list. How about Stacey Lieberman. How about Mike Levine. How about Nick. Mike Levine. Oh, geez. And do you remember the plant lady, Carol Murphy? Carol, wait a minute. Carol Murphy. Now when we first went on, we had a guy who did a fishing thing on a weekend. What was his name? Oh, gosh. I tried to forget him. He's the one who did a sports show supposed to. Yeah. Oh, man. But all you talked about was fishing. Remember the police broader show. Not really. Yeah. How about? How about behind the velvet rope. He's low. He's on the list. And you forgot did you get Steve Daley. Yes, sir. How about Mike Rosenthall? What about Robert Hall? Robert Hall. How about that? Woo. We talk about militant talk about weird boy. That was something. I have one more for me. I pulled over the side of the road to have to scribbling these down. I was doing that to this morning coming to where I was writing and driving at the same time. John Sloan did a sports show. He laid a one to the same loose. He was a sports guy for about a no six weeks. What? And Drew Hayes, that was when we had the Saturday and Sunday, six to nine show. Yeah. He used to come on the program. That's when a vagrant wandered into the station and didn't understand a word of English. That was at the old Fabio Rosa. Yes, I was. What was that? I could never forget that. One other thing I have to say. First of all, Chris Mars never worked at the NWS. Okay. I didn't think so. Yeah, he became sports director at TAP and then he went to the wall. Yeah, that's right. I cross him up. I don't think he worked. I got to say one thing about Alan Eisenson. Alan Eisenson said. I'm about Alan Michaels. Boy, well, you have you spent a lot of time there. Yeah, too much. It's quite a bit, but Stacey Leaveman, I'm about Facy Stacey. I'm about Frank Lasko. I'm Frank Lasko. And Shirley Peters, member Casper, Chains of Format and all of a sudden, Frank and Shirley were reading the news together at noon. I remember those days with the bullet. I'm unbelievable. But I have to ask a one thing. I heard that put Steve Payne say something about losers. I got news for you. At least I had a social conscience. I didn't go freebies all the time. Did he make a snide comment about it? You was saying, you know, how come you didn't mention Steve Payne. You mentioned all those losers like Mike Spindell. Oh, I got news for you. I don't consider myself a loser. Worked there was a believing that was almost like radio 101. I got news for at least Spindell got out of FTL before it was too late. I got news for you. I don't get him six months there. Six months. I know the crowd there. Believe me. But I had to come down with a couple of these names. Irbshindler. Did you get Irvin? Yes sir. Okay. Listen. I'm waiting a minute. Wait a minute. If anybody would know, I've been going nuts. There was a rental put a real. I mentioned this before. A left wing. Her name was Ellen or Elaine something on on a weekend. And she was on December. She did a show with the IRA terrorist on this. Oh, I swear. Make yes. Ellen. Ellen. It wasn't Ellen more phone. No, that's for sure. I think the other end of the spectrum. No. I cheered. What about the young guy that you put on Glenn? Glenn Hutton. Right Glenn Hutton. We got him. But you also had Tom Jacket. You mentioned him. Yes sir. Well, there's a whole list. And a cat that millions. But I think what else you can do is maybe do a separate list on some of the great people. Yeah. I sure do. I can tell you some interesting stories about the walker. I'm sure. Bob Barton. Bob Barton. All right. Wasn't John Broward. One of the original callers to that station. Well, he was one of the call of the KT. He was chronic on a KMU. Don't remember KT days. Come on. I know we're getting old. But let's get with a big guy. I try to forget those days. As a matter of fact, people asked me what I've been doing for about the seven or eight months. I was at WFTL. I said I was out of radio. Yeah. But let's not worry. What can I tell you? I'm freezing here, but I had to get in with a few names. Mike. Great hearing from you. Okay. Take care. Thank you. Bob. Steve has made a lot of friends in the business. We all make our enemies, but Steve's got a special place in most people's heart. And I noticed Steve did not call in this morning when we need him. When we didn't need him last couple of times, he called in. Come on, Cain. Cut the crap. Well, you need your help. I've got a list here that's, uh, I'm just filling in on the edges. It's just, they've got to be over 100 that I've got. And keep in mind, I only worked there six years. They were on the year for like 13 years doing that floor mat, or at least pretending to. It's 1124 at WIOD. This was kind of a hillbilly Yahoo guy. Oh, y'all was right. First came there. Yeah, it rolls in Larry. We're really, really took a shine to this building, put him in the newsroom. I remember the light with the arrow. Yeah, we got it. The light box rolls. Wait a minute. The late Rick River all. Yeah, he passed away a few months back. The one disease. Are you serious? I didn't know that. Yes. Well, wait a minute. Let me put that on here. Okay. Unbelievable. The white box rolls. Yeah. Uh. We're trying to remember. I'll see. This is great because everybody who calls adds a few others. Now Suzanne Haddley. I was just saying, called earlier, I almost just blew me away. In the business. I couldn't believe it. She used to wear skirts up to her neck. I never saw anything like it in my life. Speaking of advocacy, I'm not counting. Got it. You got some of their Clark bar rappers here. Two is a matter of fact. You'd be really proud of us. We saved them. I knew someday they'd come in good for something. And. All right. Well, I think the well is run dry. But you did a great job. You contributed. Did a great job. And, uh, hanging there. I'm going to be at the end of the day. I'm on the way out standing. We'll be keeping our eye. And if you see, which nervous advanced guard of these out there. I'm a, I'm a, I'm a real friend. A river friend from the D.O.T. And our if he if he's on, I'll wave it. Uh, go stand to see. And then one like hell. We're a way. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. There was another board off. But just came back to me. I think there's a, there were two of them was Dave something. Remember the guy was John Levitt's friend. Are Dennis Saunders Dave Saunders Dennis. Dennis. There you go. Dennis. That's what it is. Uh huh. Remember he was there. He was there with the Mickey Sooky man. Yes sir. Take it away. Thank you Bob. All right. And the sauce. See you later. On bowl. Oh, what is that? Did we do a break? Did we did we did one? Well, I don't want to get all behind again. Stan made you're. I'm going to get fired. That's the Marine. Yeah. How could we forget Nancy? What was all together during the first couple of years? Yeah. Nancy. Marine. Boy. Unbelievable. And you don't remember who that Ellen was. Do you already. Oh, I don't remember her. I don't know. I'm talking about you weren't here then. You were fired so many times. Or walked out. Now who was that Twinkie producer that you walked out over? What was her now? I don't understand. I don't know. You don't know. I don't remember. I don't think she ever came to work. Did she? Oh, I don't know. Anyway, that's one thing that, you know, Casper wouldn't hire her. I thought I needed a producer because I was doing that stupid split show. Come on, Stan. You just want to hire some little Twinkie. You're not here. Come on. And don't forget my former wife that you hired as a board up. Oh, yeah. Diane Major. Diane Major. How long was she there? She never told me. About two days. Not average. Unbelievable. Well, don't forget the good old days of the Murray-O-Bot lift. Yeah. Charlie Capis. Wheeling himself up and down the hallway having all kinds of fits about what we were doing on the air. The cops guarding the front door. Yeah. And you trying to dial up the White House. Yeah. Remember that little engine? I sure do. That scared the hell out of me because you were dialing White House numbers that hadn't been invoked yet and strange people were answered. Right. We were getting through like CIA numbers and inside the previous service and gun. I were tracing it the other way and you could hear all these little tones on the pan. I was ready to leave the building at any given moment. Well, so is your a William seat and get out soon enough. But you never got to talk to Jimmy about the boat lift. No. That was disappointing. Well, we could have changed a lot of things. This list of you could see the list. I'm going to read it in about ten minutes. It is just a mammoth. Yeah. Well, James are coming back. The police officer that we had there thought his name was Gary something. He was doing traffic for a while. He was an actual man. Oh, yeah. But it wasn't Gary. And I think he also passed away. Yeah. That was a stranger arrangement arrangement the Casper made. I never really figured out what that was. Yeah. And we also after our time they had a show called Ask the attorneys on Sunday night. Somebody said Paul Graverhorst. Does that name ring a bell? That person. Somebody will. I'm going to write a wolf. I'm going to write a wolf. Are we going to roll for your member? Yeah. I'm really getting a charge out of some of these names because I haven't heard them for so long. Well, when I tell you when Suzanne Hadley called and before I just about dropped my White hot. I just about went nuts. I wonder she's still wearing those skirts there back in Vogue now. Yeah. She's been saving them for a rainy day. Have a good time. See you, Stan. 1223 at Wiod. The list is growing. We're just building to a crescendo to a fever pitch. I want to say it again though, and I'll see you all this. I think it is grotesque and pathetic that we have such a bunch of nerds writing about radio and his time. That they haven't given the dude to the Casper. I think it is unconscionable when jikas heard Tuesday. I'm going to just slide him through the rate drop. I'm going to just do a tap dance on his bald head because it's pathetic. I mean, this man was responsible for making more things happen in radio and this market than my cantan even. It's 1223 at Wiod and we'll be then even in Mark Kuhn. And we'll be right back. Oh, are we having a day? Now does it sound like we're dancing on somebody's grave? Does it sound because we are? 26 past noon at Wiod and again the people over there and I'm sure that the ones who are mature and got their head screwed on straight like Alice. They know it's not personal. It's got just the business. Like the Sandy it's about the only thing she ever said in her life that made any sense. It's the business. Did you see her with those dark shades on the news last night? Boy. Oh, Sandy. My cranberry by the way is just dying to have her back on in the morning to a two guy show. Let's go to a mobile and Davy. No. Yeah. I've had a guy. Great. What's happening on this Friday? What's happening on this Friday? I have to. Boy, those names I've never heard of before. These are memories that even dolly part would be embarrassed by her. Unbelievable. Yeah. So now what's the I just tuned in because I kind of got to play today. Yeah. What's what's the deal with this funeral scene here now? We're having a little procession. It begins. I believe it for this afternoon. If you stay tuned as soon as Dick and Doug get into building. Okay. We will put out the info on the year. I guess we've got an exact meeting place and just and we're just going to all cruise by a little procession very orderly and we're not going on their property because Marvin's not in the mood to spend a weekend in jail. And we got some flowers that some people sent by it. It's just going to be beautiful. It'd be very touching. Did you really get a her? Yeah. Yes. You got a job out with the line full of cars with flags on or what? Yes sir. Now how do we join in? Well keep listening. Like I said as soon as the boys get in here we'll give you all the details. All right. Sounds good. You got to come and join us? Of course I am. Great. And listen to the traveling man if you're out there. Get a life huh? Amen. Later. See you. I'm 28. At WIOD a day that will go down in flames. And I think flaming at one point was the operative word of WS News. I don't want to sound like I'm telling any tales because I'm not going to give any names. But I will say this. Once upon a time there was more fruit at WNWS than you'll find in the protest-paraminate publics. I mean it was just and it was not like it can be spiracy. It just kind of happened. It just kind of evolved that way. 29 past noon at WIOD just a couple of minutes I'm going to read my entire list. That should take us up to three. You know you see this next one? Jupiter. Hi. Hi. Listen I have an idea for the new listeners. It's called the Gerritol Hotlami. Let me ask you a question. Didn't you call yesterday? Not me. Didn't you get disconnected? No, no. My husband called yesterday. Your husband? Yeah. I didn't. Your husband isn't big out from Bokaz. Oh no. Oh. Okay. Anyway, I have to give you a new listeners. He's called Gerritol Hotlami. For people between 80 and 150. And he's featuring Debbie. They aren't only woman things. I'm falling. I can't get up. And then people will go with their tractor. And their hopes will be corrupt. On. I don't know. Okay. I have two names for you. I don't know. Okay. Don't start her. Don't start her. He was never on there. He was on wins. No. No. He wasn't. Don't start her. No. No. He wasn't. He was on life. You have a father last year too. He was never on there. He was on life. He was on GBS. But that doesn't count. Oh. I got another one. I got another one for. I can't believe that their fans haven't called in with this. Horshul. Horshul. Gordon. Oh. Oh. You're a curmudgeon in the dump her. Oh, boy. I tell you. But I just want to like my idea about the J. Oh, hotline. Yeah. Outstanding. Aren't you getting goose bumps from all of this? I'm not going to tell you. I'll be only three people I used to listen to over there was you. I'm a dairy at night. I mean instead of ram demarting, you wish it had a dairy at night over there instead of ramding. Have a nice weekend. Okay. You too, Neil. Yeah. Getting a little carried away. Don't you think. 1231 on W.M.R.Z. Oh, I'm sorry. There are no such colors. Are they memories? Or did Roger find that by the way? Where'd he get that? Is that in the paper? About the new colliders? Or did he just make that up? I don't see it. Oh, here it is. Here it is. It's in the Harold, which agree. Juan Carlos, Code Texas, right on top of it. Station is applied with the FCC for a change of color. It is to W.M.R.Z. As in memories, columns said he expects approval. Great. I like it. Pay phone from Hylia. I need all you doing. Great. My brother and I are longtime listeners and first time collars. Great. Did you see the Harold? I know you don't read the Harold. We're here in Dave County, so we're forced to. But they had an article about how why 100 is trying to get the dolphin broadcast? As Debbie Ellis would say, sir, fat chance. You think so? What are they going to do? They have no sport. They're going to have athletes foot through the game? Well, they'll wrap behind it. Exactly. But a little MC here. We're going to have the morning zoo out there at the 50 yard line. Don't worry about it. We have a couple of names for your W.S. news list. Yes, sir. Stock ahead. He's on the other line. Elvis? Elvis? Yeah, I thought Elvis is on. Yeah, he was. Good. And Janet Staplin. Yeah. And Jimmy Hendrix? I think they're living in Africa. And Rick Nelson. Rick Nelson. Anyhow, we'd like to call a few people a douchebags. Can we? Quickly. Very quickly. All right. Chris, Bob, George, Popps, and my uncle who works for BSO. You're all douchebags. And Andy Griffith. We're out of material. See ya. 1232. I forgot to spot, didn't I? While we were studying social out of pressure, we wouldn't want to forget our good friends over Toyota Hollywood. What do we? You bet we would not. Patrick Murray would be Appleplectic. And there's great news for Toyota buyers from the southeast. Ties, volume of Toyota dealership, Toyota Hollywood. It's simple. Toyota of Hollywood will beat any deal on any new Toyota car truck in the southeast period. How can it be any planer than that? No gimmicks, no confusing equations. Toyota of Hollywood will simply beat any bonafide deal on any new Toyota. And because there's such a high sales volume dealer that allows them to cut the prices right to the bare bone, if we can say that, creating more happy buyers who spread the word like wildfire because customers are treated so well after the sale. Toyota of Hollywood has gotten the Toyota President's award for the highest customers satisfaction over and over again. How can you beat it with a stick? High volume low prices, excellent service by factory train professionals. It'll keep you coming back to deal time and time again. So if you want to check out the new 91, Tersello's Karola Salica, Superies the trouble free, Camry and the great new lineup of Toyota trucks and a great preview fan, that's the place to do it. Get in there this weekend and see them all and make a deal of a lifetime at Toyota of Hollywood. The 1841 North State Road 7 right between Tant and Sheridan Streets in Hollywood. What are you doing? We're not doing this spot now. We're doing another break. I just, that's from the last break. Dummy? Let's come up in a couple of minutes. Okay, just relax. I knew what I was doing for a segment.

Anyway, it's 1234 and I promised we would do this. And I got to find something appropriate. I can't do it over Tammy Smith because that wouldn't be. Oh, come on. Come on now. Jeez. That would be sacrilegious. Wow, Roger's got all these CDs jammed in there like so damn tight. That it's kind of embarrassing. Let's put something appropriate. Maybe we've got something that they're playing on the ear. Here we go. Okay, now listen carefully. Those of you former employees over there, those of you are too chicken to call in and won't help us out. And then if you notice anybody glaring that we've left out, you call in immediately even if it's off the ear.
