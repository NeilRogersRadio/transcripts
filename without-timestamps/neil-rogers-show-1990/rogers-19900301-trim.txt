You're going to be driving around with suspended license man, suspended a sentence. You're going to have to see Marlon Brando and I got news for you. He's so big now, nobody can even get in the door at his house. So instead call the ticket defense team for just 99 bucks. They'll go to court for you and they'll defend you on all. Non-criminal traffic tickets and accident cases even DUI. You'll have an attorney there to go to bat for you. And he has a better batting average than Johnny Mies and Smoky Burgers put together. The ticket defense team. And let me remind you again, if you remember of Triple A, am I cost you nothing or pretty close to it?

And it's some promotion for where do you say up in Kissimmee? They're doing a waterflume thing? It's kind of looks a little bit too old like about 90. Now he's okay, he's a good guy.

How cute of it about that. Do you ever see a trout sneeze by the way? Something to think about. I guess you're allowed to sneeze but not between your knees. I thought it was very innocuous and very amusing but again you're dealing with Cox broadcasting sir. You can do it with a bunch of nervous now. It's gone. It's dead. You put on your best of tape. Why we might be able to do that. As you can do that. That's what we ought to do. We ought to put all the stuff on the tape that's coming here that we can't play in here. Which would probably fill up like volumes. Yeah. Right. There you go. That kind of crap. Yeah. How do you care to tell how it could play a trouser trout with no problem? Of course. He's got more money than the Satan New York. That's got nothing to do with it. He don't work for a Cox broadcasting. Okay. The feet are worth for the sisters. Listen to the trick you can play on.

So anyways, love 41 and WIOD. We have an open line of day, 751, WIO and D. We got Rick and Suds at Joe Robby Stadium this afternoon from 2 to 6. God only knows what they're going to do. They're sitting in an empty stadium for four hours. But hey, that's the way we do it here on WIO and D. And we got the Yankees and the Brave's exhibition game tonight. We don't have it on the air. But we have it. How come we're not broadcasting that game? Being part of the Yankees network. How come we're not doing that? Well, that's okay. We got something a lot better than that. We got the Hank with D on tonight. Miami. Hello, Neo. Yes, sir. Hey, I've been on the road. Woo. I've been listening to 1770. I've been through a lot with your station. 1970. Yeah. What does that mean? Well, I mean, I've been through the urine lady. The con liver oil guy, the spoon benders. Uh-huh. But this turd did stuff really get me worried. Uh-huh. Yeah. I've been listening tonight. I cut my wife, washing my underwear, and deep turgent. Uh-huh. I'm worried about it. You haven't listened to anything in 70, you're right. Right. Long time. Yeah. If I call my buddy, uh, Paul, Penny Pitcher, a douchebag? Okay. I have a great day, sir. Neo. Yeah. Can you play the on-in-on disease? Okay. Carter? What does that call? That's not what it's called. Yeah. On-in-on anonymous or something like that. Well, I'll have to dig around for it. I'm going to make a big effort. Okay. What is it? I figured out on-in-on. Right. I figured out why the bear lost to the dolphins this year. Yeah. That last second play? Yep. It was Jim Esien walking behind my dick-a-claping his hands. Okay. Have a great day. Bye. See ya. Wow. What does he want to hear? Well, is that in the, uh-huh. He sure did it for me. I'll take it that. Uh-huh. What does it call George on-in-on-in-on? And that's the way it goes. I don't think that's in here, but I'll check. I'm checking for you. If not, it's in our thing, man. It's good. On-in-on-on. How do you like that? 14- uh-cuts 17. I'll get it for you, sir. Just take a deep breath now. Just in hell. Oh. Oh. God. I wish I could just get this last four pounds of flim out of my throat from this cold. I'd be in good shape. Ah. Oh, good. We could make a little cake for, uh, nild-on Monday with it. Here's a lady in sunny Isles. I need a Hawaiian. Okay. Take some more hot tea and lemon and hot wine. No, no, I'm all right. Just, you know, there's always this a little, uh, hang over there, so to speak. I know. I call it a post-nadele drip. Uh-huh. It drops down the back. We've heard from a few drips this morning as a matter of fact. Yeah. Recently, yeah. I need some advice for you even more than hearing a cart. Um, Sunday, those Marlin applications are coming out. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Mine hasn't, of course, expects to mail it at 801 in the morning. Um, what is that? Are you getting founders club seats for yourself? No, I am not. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. Yeah, I'm not. Well, why would I be interested in that? What? What is it? It's a little bit of an elitist. I don't, I'm not an elitist. I don't, listen, let me say something to you. Okay. Whatever anybody else wants to do, that's fine as long as they leave me alone. And I don't go to a ball game to be seen by people. Did I'm saying I don't go there. Uh, like the women who go to the hockey games and Canada with their FERC, the Mint Coats and Sidney, your front red seats. I'm not interested in that. I go to enjoy the game and have a hot dog and scream and yell I'm just having a good time and be left alone. That's all. I don't go there to be elite or to be a hot shot, which is why they can take the W.I.D. Skybox and they can jam it up their butt. So, are you getting used to it? Because they have all these phony's up there and all the sales people and all the management people and people up there wouldn't know a ball game from their arm pit. And I just don't, I don't have fun doing that. I just want to go have fun. Now are you going to get an infield at the box? I'm getting a club bomb getting the club seats. The club seat. That Mr. Pony tail has. I see. Why do you keep asking me what I'm getting? What are you getting? I've never been to the stadium. So, and I don't really love stadiums. I have to be fairer than what I mean. Why? I don't like looking down. It feels like I'm falling down. Well, you're afraid of heights. Yeah. So, get the box seats. Get infield boxes. They're great for baseballs. As long as you don't get them too low though. You want to be a few rows back. Well, those will be starting. Unless you want to be a couple of people who want to sit in the first row with the Founders box and reach over and pat the guys on the butt. That kind of stuff. Well, I thought I'd be seeing on television. Oh, you want to be like that white hair lady in the Cubs game. So, rig leave field. Every time Harry sings take me out to the ball game. Every time they got to show this one white hair to old bags. She's an every game. And for whatever reason she always catches the eye of the camera man. Every day we got to see this babe. Oh, God. Well, I told my husband I was calling you. And he's listening. So, yeah, I'll never get those found as club seats. It's up to you. Why do people care what I'm going to do? I mean, what difference does it make? You know, you're a connoisseur. No, I'm not. No, I'm not. I've never seen a baseball game at your Robbie Stadium. I've got my dolphin tickets, but that's for football. I wouldn't want my football seats for baseball. It's too far out. Well, I've never even been inside the stadium. Well, you're like the stadium. Believe me. It's a beautiful stadium. There are very few bad seats. And it's just the atmosphere. It's brand new and it's sparkling and it's clean and you'll love it. Trust me. All right. I do trust you. That's why I call you. Okay. Have a great day and tell your husband to butcher up. Okay. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Oh, I don't know. How about some macaroni and cheese? You know, that, well, I mean, you know, make up your own mind. Guys, come on. Boach up a little bit, damn it. I'm 47 at W.I.O.D. Speaking of butcher up, how about that mark race and a new butcher brush cut that haircut? What do they call those now? See, years ago, those were either like a brush cut or a crew cut. And all the guys like in the Navy wore those. Another military guys all had a crew cut. Now they wouldn't use that. What would they call them now? Spike? No, no, he's not spiked. No, no, I know what you're talking about. No, this is just like a regular military, you know, a flat top. That's even worse than the other ones. Well, anyway, if you're flat on top, and not because you got to cut that way, but because it stopped growing some time ago, what a segue. Check the Charles Alphay theory here, sister.
