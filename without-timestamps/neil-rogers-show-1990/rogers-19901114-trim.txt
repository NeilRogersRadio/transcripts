Oh, you are such a hauser, it's a bit. Look at a spill and stuff on the table. What's makes Wayne gonna say when he sees the mess, you're making air, Mitch Lewis? God! You're worse than Jerry Lee Lewis. By the way, save me one more of those. OK, I'm gonna have a throw real fit in here, because I have never seen such caring on. Look at that. This one's almost empty already. You people are a bunch of hazers in here, OK? That's pig doll, you go, I am. Thank you, Andy. Look at that, we got four Jews all in here in the same room. Boy, I feel so much more comfortable now. All we need is Robbie Benson. Twelve minutes past eleven. What is he like, twelve now? Is he ever gonna grow up or what? You see, go one of those pre-pubric diseases where he looks like he's twelve until a day he dies. That's kind of embarrassing, isn't it? Anyway, you want a great attend. What is, uh, look at that? You've ever just give a look in here. Oh, my missing something. Well, I got news for you. Honey, there's only two slices left. So don't think about it. To not scratch your head. There's only two left. What? What does that mean? Oh, she's going over there. You don't have to worry about that. I've all of pizza in the world for us over there. She's going over to Florida. Oh, no. Oh, no. It's not only cold, but the next case is the people first. I object, Mystic Kennedy. Yes, the trial hasn't begun yet. Oh, right. I knew that. Now, in the matter of... Don't forget, Miss Trials. Mystic Kennedy is sit down. Sorry. Now, counselor, you have your briefs with you. Your honor, please, the court. I am not wearing any underwear. Whoa! Oh, my God! Please, Miss Trials. Mystic Kennedy, are you prepared to give your opening statement to the jury? Okay. Well, I'm pretty sure my guide didn't do it. Thank you. Whoa! Oh, my God! Oh, Paul, indeed you have a question. Yes, now we've reached a verdict, your honor. But we haven't heard any evidence yet. Oh, that's okay. We find Mr. Kennedy not intelligent. Oh, my God! Very good looking. Whoa! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! Oh, my God! 1118. At WIOD, they're salad. There's pizza just everybody have a great time. Boy, I have never seen such a like, closest. Was that fast to why? I'm not talking about you. Do I have to go through this mood thing with you every day, Cheryl? Just take the goddamn pizza and cut the crap. Anyway, we hope you're having a nice day. Every day she comes in with this mood. And if you don't look at her just right, she's like moody and looking at my, I think her mom oughta slap the crap out of her, okay? It's too late. If I was your son, I'd run away from home. Anyway, let's take a call. And how good North Miami be on one, WIOD, you're not North Miami, are you? No. Of course not. I'm dead. Well, you'd rather be in North Miami, though, wouldn't you? Probably. Be honest with me. I will. Okay. You ever did have to see Santa Barbara? Maybe a few minutes here and there over the years. Well, you know who was in the last week? Kelly Craig. Kelly Craig from Channel 4 News? Yes, sir. Are you serious? Yes, you played a nurse for a couple of days. You mean it was like, uh, current like she's doing it now? Like, it was, it's so, well, in the whole album, they filmed it, but it's so about, I say about a week and a half ago. Incredible. And that's funny. We better check that out. You do that. I love Kelly Craig. I know I play this right, huh? And as a cutie's a bug and she can read the news and she's great. I know. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. I'm happy. Start shaking. I'm tilting and try to adjust, you know, center the picture. It's impossible. Oh, you know what? Here mind me of, um, if you want that movie The Big One. The Big One. The Big One? Yeah. Well, that John Homes movie. Yeah, I saw that. Oh. It was that, that news reporter guys are coming. Come on. There's on the phone. I'm not a phone. On the television. I get thinking, there's a channel channel. Transition channel. Hey, I've been there for six or whatever. It is here. See you a star, I will. Well, listen. Have a wonderful day. Well, you too. already. 21 after 11. Now is this bill tanner? So we went from a three three or three five to a three. We have an open line in Palm Beach. Now that's just pathetic. Isn't it? The Mr. G. I hope somebody goes up there and takes their laundry and wraps it around his neck. In fact that's one of the things they did in this movie mortal passion. After they killed the wife's boyfriend, they stuffed him in a big plastic garbage bag and they buried him under the backyard under the thing. Certainly something to think about Mr. G. We have an open line in Brower. Look at that. Five, two, four rolled up here but spring breaks coming back. Isn't that a laugh? I keep reading these articles in the Sun Sentinel now every day about that. They've all not maybe wasn't such a good idea to get rid of those kids. Let's bring them back. We really like you, you know. Yeah, that's what this town always does. They chase everybody up. They have no alternative. No game plan. All they know is they don't like whoever is here. How come they don't chase the damn Canadians out, the French Canadians? The only thing they bring us here is like heartburn. They don't spend a damn dime. They clog up the road. They run around spares. They sound like they're constipated for life. Get rid of them. But now they think the kids are going to come flocking back to beautiful for Loderdale so they can see all those 150-year-old people out there with their rockers in their walkers. Okay? Get serious. Here's a mobile on a starline. Call a bull from say. See we. See we. We got 595 in Davy. Go in the median right here. Hello boys. Okay. You know who that was, don't you? He's starting to get on my nerves again. Tuna that was Woody. You're getting on my nerves again. Woody you're okay like once a week, but you're out of control. What is wrong with these cronics? What is their problem? They need a mental institution for cronics like Mr. G and Woody. Mr. G he wouldn't even once a year would be good for him. But what is the problem with these people that just can't put a lid on it. Market is up 13 points. Look at that. I'd go out and start buying like crazy. Wiod Georgia's psychotic. Hey, is on. Okay. I'm calling for the app. We're on the mobile. Just got back into town. Yeah, okay. Yeah. Yeah. I want to talk to Neil. You're speaking to Neil. Sir get with it. I take a couple of doggy uppers and get with the program. Come on. Hey, jet lag Neil. Yeah, that's what we view back here. Yeah, you know, your friend Howard Stern mentioned you yesterday. Yeah, I'll bet Howard Stern don't know me from Masha Puppacco. He did mention he said you wanted a better power. Yeah. Howard said that. He has sir come on. Not how he would never say that. I wish me like that. How he and Robin both said it. Really? Really. Maybe I could do midday's on K Rock. No, I'm going to the cemetery yesterday and I would have him tuned in and that was it. Yeah. I know how he's like, how he's like, how he a lot. You know, especially is here. I'd like to just run my fingers through his hair. He looks like a guy in the, uh, what is it? What's the story? It's a mystery, yeah. Anyway, wish me happy birthday. Neil's just got back in the town. Happy birthday, sir. I'm don't have a little bit. I am. How we did say that about you. Well, that's great. You must be going through change of life. I can't. How you take care of it. See you. Bye. Wow. Howard Stern and Dick summer and Dick Burton all made you tell in America. Love is the Neil Rogers show, okay? But you know the one that I'm proud of stuff of all of those people in America, the one that I'm proudest who loves this show. Hi, this Larry King, and they don't come any better than Neil Rock. My number one fan loves me. But don't get too close. Larry, do you know that they said on the CNN yesterday, they were doing the story about his latest, the breakup and his impending divorce. They said that this is his sixth wife. Six. You know what, Angie Dickinson said. She said if you close your eyes and take a lot of volume, Larry's not so bad, especially if it kicks in just at the right time. It's 1130. And now seriously, stop and think about it. I mean, let's face it. Most of us are not beauty pods, okay? But just imagine waking up next to that to a lump of skin and bones. With that big thing sticking up onto the cover and then of course, as she pulls it up and much to where she grin, it's his nose. Here's a pay phone in Fort Lauderdale. Hey, Neil. Yeah. I got a beauty for you. I got an excellent tech report from these douchebags down on Miami. You ready for this one? Okay. I got down to get a Dallas ticket for a night for a heat game. Coming down a street and I'll run a red light light. Yeah. This cop pulls me over. I don't blame him. He should have thrown your ass in a slime or put you in a raven. Well, that's just a little bit of a chair, pal. Okay. So listen. Yeah. It's down to me on my cars right now. Check it up. And you know just about maybe 10, 15 minutes ago before when you were a young and screaming about to grow. Wanty, the pizza's kitchen run away from her all the Democrats. He should. Okay. He says, I want you to turn that radio off right now. That upset that obscene bastard right there. I don't want to listen to. Hey, Kyle, go back and send it to your car and write the ticket. I'm ready. I'm ready. I'm running away to me. He called me an obscene bastard. I'm bastard. I'm bastard. Yeah. You believe the bastard he said? How old was you 110? I'm a Cuban guy about maybe 30 years old. Oh, yeah. Well, I got your bastard right over here, pal. Okay. It's right under your bed. He says, I don't, I don't want to be a, what else? Let me think exactly. Oh, he said, this guy is obscene. He's a bastard. And I don't want to have my time wasted listening to him. I said, look, you're giving me a, I'm to go listen to his own radio. I'm to turn on radio memories. It's right up in time to turn on La Cubanísima. That's right up his alley. Well, I turned it up just a little bit louder. He, uh, kind of threatened me said, you know, are you trying to, uh, trying to threaten me here? He says, are you trying to challenge me? I said, I'm not trying to challenge you at all. I said, you're right. Me a ticket. I'm listening to my call. Exactly. You want to listen to the damn show you know, I'm here his crap. I still got a 30 dollar ticket. Good for him. I can't even read his name. I wish I could just let you know. He probably knows Joe Carrillo. So you better watch it, Belle. I'm looking at that out of there. Anyways, you just like to have a little information about those lovely pigs down in South Dade, those metro. Let me just try, I want to tell you a little story, okay? You know, we do a spot for low jack, which I've been doing low jack for years now. Since they first came into Florida. And I really believe it. It's a great great invention. And it works and it's just a tremendous. Okay. We do a good job for them on a show. And I joke around with this thing with the pig reports and the pig patrol in a spot. I'll say, you know, it helps the pigs get your car back. And some jackass from one of the sheriffs to probably the BSL. But I don't know where called them up there whining about it the other day. Okay. Because I use the word pig. Now let me ask you a question. You know, that charity football game that they play over here, what do they call that? It's called ZPD. And who came up with that name? Did I come up with it? Did they do it themselves? Okay. Yeah. So if they say pig will it's okay. But if I say the pigs they're right away. And I'm going to have a scene bastier to whatever he said. Okay. I hope his guacamole melts on his thing. Okay. I hope he gets four flats and has to walk back in a station. Yeah. Right. And now it's standing. And it's hooked in his ears dragged all the way and burned on the street. And runs into Dave game in the middle of the highway. I don't know. I've got to get a charge out of it. Everybody's off. See. We're not doing a remote. We're not doing a remote. It's not remote. Where is the pizza? Florida is its on 79th street. Just two blocks east of Biscayne. Can you handle that? I think I can't. A.L. You can get a great job. And I enjoy listening to you. In fact, I turned on a police dispatchers. I worked over it for a while. They all knew that. And anyway, I thought you didn't enjoy it. So have a good one on that. Okay. Tell him to put a lid on it. Thank you, Mike. See you. I've seen bastard and deed. Okay. Boy, we still have. I see. I can understand that from 75 and 80 year old Cubans were still, you know, screaming about Maria. If you had any idea if I had $10 for every Cuban who listens to this show, I could buy Cuba and send Fidel back to. Where would it have come from? Where did he come from? Hunger? Thank you. What's real bad for you? But case real good. Sugar. And what gives you the excess energy to drive mom crazy? Sugar. So what breakfast cereal will you tell mom to buy? Next time she goes shopping. Sugar Shakers. Sugar Shakers. New super sugar coated sugar shakers. Our little bits of raw cane to drenched in honey and coated with powdered sugar. Glucose fructose corn syrup and other natural sweeteners. And taste their slight starter coated sugar. Right. Because there's new yucky vitamins or minerals to spoil your fun. Yeah. And how does it make you feel? Like I'm vibrating. I love my little bunch of cartoons. I love my smile. I love you, sugar shakers. And mom's a love sugar shakers too. Because inside every box there's a free bottle of new Flintstones Chool-Ballion. So try. Super sugar coated sugar. From your friends at irresponsible food. I have no right. 1140. 20 till noon at Wild. There's an open line in Broward 524. Now listen. In 20 minutes Dick and Doug will be over at Flores, which is right up the street. 79 street. Why do people keep asking? I've explained it over and over. This is not a hard place to find. Okay? If you're coming from like on the beach. You come on a 79 street causeway. You come west. And then the road kind like there's a fork. When you get on the other side of the bridge there's a fork in the road. Pick it up and the stuff it in your nose. Now there's a fork in a road. Don't go to the right because that goes off the 82nd street. Which is a nice way to go home from here to get to i95 because 79th street is the worst street in all of South Florida. All of people on 79th street are on drugs. Okay or on something because they drive like their finger is somewhere. The worst. Airvijolapi, Airvijolapi, Airvijolapi, Airvijolapi, Airvijolapi. It's on the right hand side as you're going west. It's on the left hand side as you're going east. It's on the north side of 79th street. A couple of blocks east of Biscayne Boulevard. Florida is green with the red sign. It's outdoors. There's benches. There's parking spaces. That's Florida's got it. It's like the other day. We're like two blocks south of Gulfstream Park at the specs last Wednesday. And you still had people. Oh, they're getting lost. They don't know how hard is it when you say I'm at Biscayne and 208. There whatever was. How hard is it? And that's one thing we'll be checking on this afternoon. So anyway, they'll be over there from noon to two. And we've got the unbelievable t-shirts, the incredible ones that are just from captured glory would make all our t-shirts. And the Rick and SUDs, newscrew t-shirts, what of which are modeling myself right now? Oh. And those are 20 bucks a piece. We'll have them in sizes, no less. We really have this thing under control. And the best in the Yucca set tapes which are 20 bucks. Now Joe at Florida's, well, boy, that lunch was great. If you buy two slices of pizza, so does our free. If you buy some of our stuff, if you donate. And at the end of the noon to four segments, he's going to donate 20% of all of money he takes into into those four hours. Two commels house. And when I get over there shortly after two, we will, everybody be sure when you buy any of this stuff and make your donation. Are we going to take care of that by the way? Have they got the entry box? Great. Boy, are we doing it today? It's incredible. Just wait till we get there. We'll screw it up good. But anyway, fill out one of the entry. Then don't try to stuff the ballot box because then it can work. One per customer only, okay? And then between two and three I'll draw and we'll do it. We got the three per tickets on a 50 yard line, section 420, 442, like I said. And it's great. Right on the 50 yard line, little up high. You look down with that panoramic view. It'll be great. You'll feel like you're in our skybox, but thank God you won't be. It's 1143 at WIOD. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. I'd like to talk to you about two subjects. They're not even related to each other. How's Bill called or doing? He's coming along. His name? Slow, but deal, he'll be okay. He's never going to be back on the air. I sure hope so. Okay. The other question is it's totally unrelated. Who do you think is the best baseball player that ever lived? I know it's a tough question, but I heard you talk about Ricky Hederson. The best baseball player who ever lived? I know this is like, I'd say Felix Man T. You think Mickey Man could have been if he never heard himself? Wow. I know that. See, this kind of a question. I know. See, I was a big Mickey Manl fan, because as a kid, I was a Yankee fan. And, you know, he won a triple crown after you're what year. He hit 365 and 54 or I'm wondering whatever one. And he was great. He was a tremendous speed. He didn't run the bases. He had bad knees and those teams used to score 10, 12 runs a game, so they weren't a running team anyway. He didn't have to run. And a great fielder, great arm, tremendous power switch hitter. I mean, he had everything going. And he was certainly one of the top five. How five? Then there are those who say Willie Mays. But to try to compare athletes from one era to the next is not possible. You can't compare Thai Cobb to Brooks Robertson. You can't compare Babe Ruth to Henry Aaron or Willie Mays or Mickey. Or it looked garrering to many of these two Willie Stargill. Yeah. Yeah. Well, Neil, I think you're the best. You can't compare Dick Groat to say Sean Dunston. Dr. Strange Glob. Right. Neil, you're the best broadcaster that has ever been on the air. No question about it. That's what they're all saying now. I believe me. If people in South Florida believe that we'd really have a show. People in South Florida don't know it. They don't know. They're asked from their elbow, including that pig cop out there was making all kinds of grotesque comments about the show. I hope he sticks his burrito where the Mundo and shine. Exactly. Go morning. Go morning. Okay. All right. See you. Here's the guy from the glass works. Markets up almost 12 points. What the hell do you want? Nothing's perfect. And so anyway, Dick and Duddle be over there from noon and two. And we do have the cellular phone over there. Marvin is there. Iliana is there. Who want to make a date. She's been trying to pet on me that cute. But she's a very nice young lady. By the way, she really isn't spite of all the people here trying to hit up on her. But she's a really nice person. But she's been trying to pet on me that Cuban coffee. I'm sorry. Okay. I can, I have an iron stomach. But that stuff is like it's like taking acid from your battery and just swigging it down. And you've got to be nuts. And you wonder why some of those people get so emotional and temperamental man. If you were drinking that stuff, you'd be like doing a Mexican hat dance all day long. You'd be like on sugar shockers 24 hours a day. George likes it. Because he grew up in a van. Little of Anna. 1146 in W. I. I don't know where you grew up. It doesn't make any difference. Maybe he wants to wrote a bus through Halea. Who the hell cares? See, people don't listen. They hear stereotypes. People say out in the garage show is shock radio. It's boring. It's vulgar. It's disgusting. He's in law. What was the word? A crude, something bastard. The bastard parts right. But the other part offense me bitterly. But then when you listen, not once. But for a few days. Because once, it's like a soap opera. You can't come in in the middle and expect to know what's going on. You listen for a few days. And all of a sudden, say, hey, I don't have it a few laughs. And not such a bad time. It isn't really so bad. Right? It only hurts when they stop. And now, language lab. The show that teaches you a four language in less than 60 seconds. Today's lesson Greek. Listen one. Strawberry pie. Strawberry pie. Listen two. Apple pie. Apple pie. Listen three. Pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie. Customer. What kind of pie do you have? Answer. Apple pie. Still on Betty and Pumpkin. Language lab is a public service. I mean, not be copied or if I freeze, I'll thank you. Okay, and let me ask you a minute. If you gave the Nelson twins a big haircut, you took all that here. And you put it inside of one of those crosts. And you put it in the other. What kind of a pie would that be? 1154 Wiod. We have an open line and browner. Well, think about it for two seconds. 5, 2, 4, Wiod. Okay. We're trying to pick up the FTO. We're having a little bit of difficulty. Let's go to plantation. Hello. Hi. First time caller in plantation. Great. Want to say hello and tell you that I think your show is great. It's incredible, isn't it? Yes it is. More fun than a barrel of monkey do. And I want to ask you a huge favor. Whatever you want, because you're so nice, at least you're pretending to be anyway. Well, could you please play your case of case or show on your America's funding as accidents? Both? Well, whichever you choose. Well, which case are you talking about? You don't mean that one with a George Michael and a monkey on his back again. Do you? Well, I love that one. But you can play the other one too. I'd rather play case because it's great. It kills a lot of time. Okay. Also. Have you ever tried picking up FTO, by the way? I know I have it. We're working on it. Okay. Now what was the other thing? I'd like to call Creda Panovich in plantation a major do you spend? Okay. I'd like to say thank you to my boss, Barbara Sugarman, for letting me see on the line. Barbara Sugarman. Yes. I, you, me. Have a great day. Thank you very much. See ya. Bye. Wow. Wow. Two open lines and Broward. I'll see they know I'm going to play that. That's why somebody dropped off. Subscribe for us. Bye. And visit us with Dr. Thank you. Good joke! We've got the worst songs in America and we're counting down. Records stories are showing them. We're some odd memories in your buying them and I'm using them as coasters. First, what review of the top three songs on the charts? And number three, Gungeon Roasters is singing Sweet Child of Mine. Well, if I had a child around the house today, I'd have these four words for lead guitar, slash and his cohorts. Stay by Halloween. Number two, you're a roaster. Mayor E. No, ribbon in a perfect world. And especially not for you, you're easy, and she don't speak proper English. And a number one George Michael sings he's got a monkey on his back. Well, I would imagine it's getting a little crowded back here. But then again, you probably don't mind. And by the way, George, there are these remarkable shaving instruments called Razor. I won and lose that very ass jury. Other songs on the charts? The band Johnny H. Jazz with, I want to be a hero, and move down on the charts and deserve it, Lisa. Apparently Johnny also hates music. I don't think hero status is him and Johnny, so get a real job. And there is a song I like. Rod Stewart's newest release for Ever Young. If for a moment I thought it was a song about me forever hung. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Can now a time for a long distance dedication. It comes to us from a listener in Pasadena, California, right here at KC. I'm 16-year-old. President of my class, I'm six foot two. I've blonde here. We're 175 pounds and stars quarter back for my high school team. But KC, I have a problem. The girls simply will not leave me alone. It seems as though I'll raise one. Me four is my good looks, my X-1 physique. Why can't they just like me as a friend? Treat me as a person instead of some sex object. And quit hitting upon the overtime. KC, they have any suggestions. Shine Todd. Well, here's my answer. They're flaming up. Okay, let's get to the end. At WOD, Kelly Craig is going to be singing the National Anthem prior to the heat game at the arena tonight. Kelly Craig is also on set of Barbers. She's also on the news on Channel 4. She is everywhere. For a little squirt, she still gets around. And you know what we say here at WOD. There's nothing like a little squirt. Oh, it's a newstime already. Okay, we have one open line in date, 751. We expected a fillet too. With anything you like, 751 WOD. And then Palm Beach, 655 WOD. When we come back after the news, Rick and Dudle be over there at Flauras. We'll get a little update on the phone. You know, the diamond just wasn't my style. So I began working nightstanders, a janitor, and a soul office building. Just to keep busy, I guess, President. Paysbow, minimum wage. Anyway, okay, there's a big cheese now. Big, how you doing tonight? Hey, where are you going? I do and you have it a pretty tough night. Yeah, yeah, good night. Nice. You're going to watch it and watch the game, didn't you? Yeah, I went across the street, free pizza, beer night over there. I'm pretty tough day, thought I'd just go watch the game with the fellows over at the bar. Oh, yeah, well, I'm just going to listen to it on this old radio here to end tenors kind of shaking. I'm looking at a big screen color TV over there. It's a best picture of a scene. Yeah, big screen color. I heard it here. It's a lot of sure like the beans are ringing. I got all my work done. Oh, really? You're the girl, don't you? Yeah, you suppose maybe I could? Well, let's say what? Maybe I could. Well, I got my BMW and the garage. I got a lot of food and a radio in there. I could pick up the... You can drive me anything. No, no. I'll give my car keys. Why don't you clean out my car? I got a wick at the end of the back seat. Yeah, I've got some stuff running, including up with us. I'm anizer. I'll be back at about two hours and maybe I'll bring a piece of pizza. Okay, dad. Well, dad, listen, thanks a lot. I'm sure my keys and I'll be careful with the scratches of car. I'll be back at about two hours. Two hours. Yeah, I can do it. I'm going to watch. You're not going to bring... Well, you... You... You... You said you were a worthless... You can't be my son. Nobody's that ungrateful. You... Weth... I'll take your... Stain BMW and run that mother... ...right into them... ...damn you're really like... ...you're worth nothing but someones attention. Second good. The ring of your fingers. Big face. This message brought to you by the National Curseing Foundation. And remember our motto. Go... ...yourself. The sun's out the wheel. The passion here, man. The way you're doing. The way you're doing. The way you're doing. The way you're doing. The way you're doing. Don't let your life pass you by. You're still... ...can't get it in. Okay, we're trying to pick up the microwave show. Twelve o'clock. At W-W-O-D. Look at that board, boy. Three hot calls on that board right now. Did I predict it or not? Do I know this crowd like a book? Like a man? Now, what are they going to call in from over at Flores? To give us a little lay of land? Is that... We don't want to put a lot of pressure on Rick and Doug, but it would be nice to give a little... ...four play, before things get started, find out if there's some people over there. If there's some, no shirts. Are we going to do pictures in the bumper stickers today? Does anybody know? Ha ha ha ha. Nobody's got any. We don't know what we're doing, but we're having a great time. We're raising a lot of money and killing some time. Pembroke Pines. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I got some updated information for you. Okay. About three weeks old. Ludes, finer delicate testins, still there. Yeah. It's still there? Yeah. Great. They got two of them. They have two? Yeah. Where's the other one?

Finally, 7519463751 WID. Two in Broward. Very strange day on a phone. 12.07. Every line on the board was lit and all of a sudden they disappeared like the... The phone had saved by his dance. Yes, sir. Hello. What did I go up there? Calm down a little bit. Oh, I thought everything went away. No, we're still here. Okay, are we on? What do you mean are we on? I don't know where anything I can hear. Oh my God, we are on. Wait a minute, don't they have a radio over there? Well, yeah. But I'm not near it. Yeah. Well, this is your good friend's son. Yeah, we know who it is. Thanks to the trucker, I was always... You're already there? We're off? Yeah. I've been here for half an hour. Yeah, alright. You're probably calling for her. Car, he's called from the car. He's, I know, I 75 about, I was going to wait in Naples. You're going to get America and come to the work by way at Naples, Italy. We've got all the shirts laid out here, man. They're just puns of them. Yeah, the snooze cruise shirts, your shirts, and all the sizes of the pictures are all here. And we're set to start writing and selling. Yeah, but there are no people there yet? Yeah. Eight. What do you mean eight? Well, there's eight just a few people? Well, there's just a few people. Well, what the hell is that all about? I don't know. Jeez. But I don't know what you're all this big. I'm just... You're the one that's on their way. They better be. Hold on, just a minute. Hold on, this will be great. There's no more room in the parking lot. Yeah, right. I'm serious. And we got eight people there? Well, they, I don't think they know what's going on here. There, we're in the four little dining room here in the screen room. And everybody is like milling around. They're not really sure what to do yet. Especially since it involves money. They've got to like think about it and get counseling. What are you talking about? Well, I'm serious. The parking lot is full, but we ain't selling anything. You mean like the parking lot is full of their customers who are there to have a big GD and spaghetti and pizza? I don't know. Get the hell out of there. We got business to do here. Oh, exactly. And I don't, you know, I'm trying to take an inventory. Oh, you know, you don't mean to tell me this is going to be a big bomb, do you? I'm telling you man, the parking lot is packed. It's already packed. But we're not so on anything. And now, uh, G-shared Bob and Tomber here, which guys like to buy a shirt? You know, Neil is speechless. What, sir? Oh, gee, here I am asking the evil twin something. The parking lot is full, right? Next, what do you mean next door? Well, they can park texture. But why aren't we selling any shirts or anything? Why is like everybody out there? I'll take you. You want to know why? Yeah. Because they're all there for the dolphin tickets. First of all, the dolphin tickets are going to happen. They'll two between two and three, that number one. And number two, unless they buy something, they can't fill out one of the little entry slopes and they care and eligible to win them anyway. I was trying for that, it's kind of a needless trip that. Do you mean to say that this is going to be just a bomb today? I'm not yet, it's just getting started. I'm just telling you these things. What are you getting started if the parking lot is full? You got a bunch of drifters around there. Probably the same half does in misfits that come to every remote and stand around with their finger up their nose. Well, there you go. Oh, gee. You can park next door, okay? And the sun plaza. Oh, right underneath the waxing sign. Just tip your hat. Yeah. There is your black finger up the picture of you, Dell on that post. There is no picture. Well, it won't be when I get done with it. So that's it. So it's a bomb. We're here. And people are like milling around my car. Well, what do you mean they're milling around? They're milling. All right. Oh, here we go. We're starting to sell, okay? Get the money out of your pockets and your hands too, okay? Put finger to change and start buying stuff. Oh, isn't it? What are they waiting for? Are they shopping for shirts? I don't know. I'm going to have to get out here with a bullhorn to start directing. Yeah, bull is the operative word pal. Okay. Well, we're here. We're ready. I'm going to try it just second. I'm going to try it. I'm trying to pick up the microborate show here. Wow. It's coming in unusually well today. Wait. I remember saying, yeah. You're getting better than I can. I must be having problems. Wow. Okay. Well, listen, give us another report in about 20 minutes. And I'm going to just land and release into these people. They are slow. They are slow. They are slow. This tone has been pumped by the way, Jim Jensen was excellent yesterday. Why thank you. It's good. I didn't see you were good. I said he was good. All I'm talking about in telling when he wakes up. He don't even know who I am. You know these dolphins. They pretend they don't listen to the show. Every one of those dolphins listens to this show. He does. He does. He doesn't. He does. He does. He said do you think he came around this show? He called Shula do you. He's pretty upset about it. Exactly. You heard off the air. Why are we doing $1,000 donation? I got those tapes. Are we doing a picture today? I hope. Oh, Neil, nobody can move here. No, let's forget about the pictures. Yeah. I see you just buy your stuff. You get the hell out. Yeah, because we've got to turn these people over. All of the problem with that is going to be what about the, Oh, did we back ourselves into a nightmare here? What? What? What do we got to do about the drawing? Because they got to come back. They have to be there to win the tickets. I don't do you think that they should be the case. They can't. They can't. Okay. Just phone numbers. We'll make sure everybody puts their phone number. Okay. Then they'll have to pick them up. They've long as they make a donation, then we'll get back to them. That's fair. Okay. What a guy. Talk to you about buying. Well, I see we have to kind of make it up as we go along. Because I mean, you look at the lot from the outside as you drive by. And you figure you get a few cars in there. But quite frankly, it's not like exactly a macy's. You know what I'm saying? But we'll work it out. So get in there by your stuff. Fill out the thing, drop it in a box and get there a lot of there. Make room for some more people with some money. And then we'll draw the names between two and three. And we'll call you. Don't call us. And that's it. Okay. We have one open line in date. One in Broward. Don't make us into a bunch of monkeys today. This isn't some kind of a zeder remote. Okay. They're used to it. This isn't a power 96 fiasco. This is Wiod, your happening doing its station. So get your asses over to Flores and come loose with a cash and buy the t-shirts and the tapes and fill out the thing and cut the crap.
