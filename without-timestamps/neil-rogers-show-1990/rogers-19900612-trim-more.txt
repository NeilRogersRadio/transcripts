And how about those cops? Probably won't hear from too many met's fans today. How about those cubs? A little last last night. A little late and came back. I like that Alejandro Pagno. He's my favorite. Oh, Roger picks him up real quick. What was that? Was that a crank? Oh. Oh, there's somebody there. Yes. Hello. Oh, yeah. Oh, you're there. How are you doing? Okay, hold on. I'll see Rogers too fast. He beats me to the punch on this. Of course, he's paying attention. Anyway, WIDC. We got to look at your contest. You can pick him up faster. Yes, sir? Man? Undecided? Hold on. W-0-8. Okay. Anyway, it covers B2-Mets 8-5 in case you missed it. I don't want to dwell on that because you get the met people very upset. We got a big thing coming up tomorrow. It's specs. In fact, a little lures in here right now, writing 4,000 pieces of copy. And getting everything straight now. We got all kinds of stuff down in tomorrow. We're giving away CDs. And we're giving away TCBY yogurt. And paints a lot. Come on and pick out tomorrow. Have a good time. Maybe Melville will be sick tomorrow too. He's probably packing to go to Buffalo, IOD. Okay. W-0-8. Hi. Can I get on the air? Sure, hold on. See, you're not fooling me. Those of you hang up real quick. Those are the ones that want to see if Nick is in the other room because you want to place in order because they heard Melville was sick today. Look at that phone. W-0-8. W-0-8. Do I hang up on you? Are you there? Oh, that's good. Hold on. Okay, nine minutes after 10 at WOD. I had a lot of stuff to do here, but I do this every day. In fact, I got a lot of old stuff that I wanted to play today. That I haven't played in a while. Some of it in a long time. Karts. Because I think that bugs me. Are you listening? Yes, sir. You're just there to listen? Well, I wanted to hear your monologue to see what kind of substance are topics you might have. I got a substance for you, sir. I'm sure you do. What do you mean what kind of substance? Well, do you think we're doing four hours on Nick Navarro again today? He's got more publicity than Madonna. It's just for it. It's getting pretty ridiculous. Screw him. It is. Don't be a Nick head, sir. Just remember that. Don't be a fascist right-wing pig. Sclimb ball on the Haraldosho. Man, I hope he and Harald are run off in a loop together. You know it? They make a perfect pair. Where are you? I'm north. Way north. Well, that would like where? Give me an idea. Coaster, arenas? Really? Yes, sir. You're in Jupiter? Yes, sir. Well, I'll be there. Are you going to hold on a minute? Uh-huh. For what? Oh, you want to hear the monologue? Yes. Okay. Well, maybe I can be like... Alice, Randall, I'll do a big monologue. About things are not good. And those comedy-pink-o-fashies, Jewish bags. Is that Alice? Hold on a second. I don't want to pick on Alice. See, Ed, John McJughal on this morning. I'm punching all around now, because I'm having fun coming to work. I punched up QAM turns out that Gene Michaels has learned Jai, this again, he's not there today. He had to go home yesterday at 9. Jai's a good guy. I don't wish him any yield. But I think that the heavens are trying to tell you something, Jai, about that job at QAM. I also found out some amazing stuff about people who wanted to go to work there and turn the job down. And then they came back and they changed their mind and they wanted the job. And they already gave it to somebody else, including a Johnny Dark, who may be lurking. Is he lurking here today? Next to her, he is. He's lurking. We've had little sum of conference about him. And we've all decided the verdict is unanimous. Johnny, he isn't hang out. He lurks in the hallway and he lurks outside the doorways and outside the offices. So if there are any young ladies in the building or even old ladies in the building, I wouldn't go into Brunfuzz if he's lurking out in the hallway for a second. Okay, very bizarre strange. And I know he's listening right now. You're okay, John, but strange. You lurk. Let's see, what is it, Karen? Karen? Yes, that's me. How you doing, Karen? Fine, how are you? Good, you might have to do a little spot. Go ahead. And then I'll come right back to Karen. Thank you very much. Thank you very much. I'm very excited. And enthusiastic. Would that be a better word? And enthusiastic to lovely words. Oh, I'm not favorite. Okay, hold on a second. All right. Please. So we'll come back to Karen. We'll get to everybody because for some reason, the phones are going nuts. Nick is on the board today. So boy, don't try and screw around. I think you might actually pray a little bit of attention. We'll get to the point where you'll be. So Karen? Yes, Neil. What's going on? Not a lot. How are you today? Okay. That's great. Great. I wonder if I could say hello to my boyfriend, who listens to you. Since today is my day off. Sure. I just want to say hello. I'll put you time, miss you. Who's going to cry out, Karen? You know, it's just nothing more comes down to you. Oh. You want me to come to do this back, but I could... No, you call him whatever you want, but, Pookey pie? Yeah, sweet isn't it. Yeah, real sweet. Yeah. Cold as you buck 12. It depends on what day it is. Yeah, I believe it. No, he's 26. Going on 12. No, 13, 14. Oh, it's not too bad. Yeah, I think I'm like pre-adolescent. Uh, in some ways. Mm-hmm. Some ways, yeah. I know the type. Yeah. We have a great day. Thanks a lot, yeah. Okay, Karen. Great. All right. I remember this call. No, Karen, don't take it personally. You're okay, but silly person. 10 16 in WIOD, isn't uh, WIOD. Yeah, how are you? Okay. How you doing? Great, so far, right up to this moment. What do you mean by that? I don't know. I say, would like right. I can only judge it based on what's happened so far. Did you hear Stan last night? No, that's why the day's been so good. I was watching the cubs in the metzer. Stank kind of ripped you a new ass last night. Oh, did he really? Well, he said something about his ratings. He was so good. And yours was so bad that you didn't get your bonus this year or something. His ratings were so good. That's right. So he wouldn't have, if he was on either before you or after you. No, he wasn't ripping me. He was ripping Alex. Okay. And the fact is that Stan's, that had nothing to do with it. One way or the other. Okay. The whole station was down. But Stan, every time that Abrams come out, Stan lives in a dream world. And he has this facility of taking and twisting and manipulating. To make it seem like he's really kicking serious butt. And if that makes him feel better, that's great. But you know what? Well, I got a big check comes in every Thursday. Okay. Well, he says you lost your bonus this year and if he's been on it. First of all, it wasn't this year sir. Your miss quoting it every quarter. I have a potential bonus because the book comes out four times a year. So it wasn't this year and Stan get a life. Okay. Find something. Did he have Paul Harvey Jr. on with him? Was that for real? Well, he had to got it to like a chronic. He called you. All Harvey George. Who is that guy? He was a real chronic. He had a life. And they had to put his wife on the radio last night to, you know, sure up a Stan's show. Who's why? Paul Harvey Jr. Paul Harvey Jr. Great. Well, I'm sure sorry that I watched that, that Cubs Meds game, you know, that exciting game that the Cubs did win eight to five. I just mentioned in passing. Well, Stan was kind of telling everybody he's the greatest. Well, that's good. Okay. And then they'll get a job. Okay. Thank you. Ten 18 at WIOD. See that's just a trouble maker there. Just an asshole, a trouble maker. Custan's my buddy. And he wouldn't say that crap unless he was on the air. Miami. All right, Neil. A coast spy report. Yeah, first. How about that Howard Johnson, huh? He's doing it for. All right. He's really doing it. He's really doing it. He struck out in 33 flavors last night. And I noticed Harry's called him. Whole, Johnson. Now, set a hold. We got whole. And that is a lot of pressure there. Yeah, there was a lot of pressure. I was nervous when we blew the lead because we should have had about 10 runs off by Yola who really stunked the place our last night. And then Maddox got here. He retired 15 or 16 men in a row. And then all of a sudden, his 17 like he had a buffer sticker on his car that said I lost it. All right. Hit me. Yeah. And they did. All right. I was fresher in the night than he knows. But once Alejandro Pagno came into the game, my new things could only look up. And go, how about that Sandberg and Grace and Dawson and they just all. And I will say this. You're round Walton has been bothering me this year because he invites Smith have been doing stupid things on a basis and stupid things in the field. And he and Salazar let that pop fly by strawberry drop. A lot of people looking to basketball. See, you got a double last night. It was an Ewan I could have caught that ball. And they looked at each other and let it drop. And they cost a run in the eighth inning. But then in the bottom of the same inning, he scored from first on a single because Jeffries was kind of like hot dog and it looked in the other way. That was a great play. That was exciting. We don't want to rub it in. But that was a great game. We're getting like a gun after all. Close demographics. They're sort of me. Are they lurking next door? They're not. They're not. They say this in the country music and when the parents are there, it's no speaker to English. So this morning I'm listening over there. And I hear Lionel Richie. Yeah. And I thought to myself, Sharon, if they have switched from the no speaker to English and Jeff to close. All right. Host is kicking in. They're lurking good. I mean, looking good. They're right. All right. We'll see you tomorrow. I'm going to be there in 10 o'clock. I'll be there with Nelson. And a little be there too. Now be there with my Mark Grace uniform. And should I wear my mitts? How are Jonathan's teacher? Please. Is it? See you later. Okay. 20 after 10. And WI would do. Don't forget, come on out tomorrow. We're looking to have a big crowd. I have no idea what we're going to do. We'll have a good time. Maybe Marvin will be sick again tomorrow. Is that a possibility? Anyway, we have an opening in date County. If you move real fast at 751, fascist, WIOD. Hello. Sheriff Nick. Okay. Hold on Nick. Anyway, we want to tell you about the whole thing tomorrow. And of course, Specs Music and Video Analysis. The grand opening of their newest location, 11921 South to see Highway in Sineland. Specs for years has been the place for music. And now, IOD. What do you want? Make so far, Nick. Hold on. Now, they're the place for great videos with titles like Sea of Love. Al Pacino makes his triumph and screen return in the years. Top Thriller Sea of Love. It's not that good, by the way. Now on Video cassette and available at Specs with thousands of good movies too. As it overworked New York City, cop investigating a bizarre series of murders.

So, come on out at Specs to New Specs music and video story in Sineland. We'll see you there tomorrow from 10 till 2. We'll see you there tomorrow. That would be better if they said lucky enough. 1024, a WIOD, and I wonder if Melbourne's going to show up at the remote tomorrow. Well, that is bad news. He's not the same anymore since he got that big job offer in Buffalo. And I started to get cranky for a lot of deal. Says this is about Stan. It's the only reason I punched him up in there mumbling in the back. I think they learned to mumble from Stan. Okay, we'll come back for that. Coral Springs. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, no, this is a car. I called you my morning, okay? It's who? Garry. Oh, Gary. Yeah, I called you with that crank from continental. Remember that? No. Well, I called you. I just gave you a car. Well, I got a mosquito bite in the, well, not the worst place. But I got mosquito bites in bad places. Like I have one on my cheek. I'm serious. Where's the worst, the most embarrassing place you ever got a mosquito bite? You really want to know. Well, I mean, don't say it if it's something we can't put on the air. But I mean, like give me an idea. You got the idea. I can't put it on the air. You really had a mosquito bite down like in that area? Yeah, well, again, people kind of look at you while you were scrunching, like, for what a slob, what a disgusting, a grotesque. See, the only way you're allowed to, if you're an athlete, that's okay. They put a lot of pressure. Go out on the air. You're a great athlete. Well, former and AV, the old people don't expect a lot from me. Okay. Anyhow, I called you up. I gave you this thing. I told you, I really did work for continental. Well, about, see, Friday. They played the tape. They paid your show, Neil. Yeah. They played it back to me and who's they? Continental cable. They fired your ass? They fired me for, for what I said on your day. I believe that. Come on. I have dead serious, Neil. I was working cut. That's the thing that ever happened for us, sir. Like, he emancipated. Yeah, I'm an employee, though. Good. Well, the call up for Sheriff Nick. You can go on TV shows with him. Go on the tour. Well, although tomorrow's Sally on Friday and the moon on Monday, okay? Yeah, right. No, he's no stopping it now. Would you rather work for a bunch of slime balls or be unemployed? Well, I could use the money. Yeah. Can you say the rent got a pay bill? That's why I keep working. Yeah, right? I don't know. Any ideas for job opening? No chance. Times are tough. Times are really tough. Oh, well. Hello, Nick. So looking to go to West Palm Beach. So we'll see if he leaves here and, and Melton's looking to go to Buffalo. So we'll see what happens here. Buffalo, natural. It's a interesting place to think about there. Oh, yeah. You can't beat it with a stick. Oh, all right. That's for exact what I heard. You could beat it with a stick. It's like we follow a lot. That's because Lee and you staying out with Steve. And there's like a certain camaraderie there, you know. We all know about that. So a good luck to you. Found that little teacher to call this show again, huh? That's not okay. Thanks, Ryan. Adios. There's a very good example. A lot of you more ons could learn from that guy. Okay, call this show. Make a lot of cost. Go test comments about your employer and they can your ass. Because they're all listening to say everybody listens to Wild. In hell. Yeah. The radio man was ripping you like crazy last radio man. Mr. radio. Is garbage name is that piece of view. You may wait a minute. I want to show was this. I'm standing on this radio station. Yeah. They were made your head made your way. I think the last part of investigation. They let him talk for about four, five minutes. And Paul Jr. Whatever his garbage name is was a green and would him. And agree with him about what? About about you giving him a high time. Not letting him talk and hanging up on him. Yeah. We'll see Paul Harvey Jr. And of course, I don't know if you're making this up. I'm not making it up. It's more fun to agree with you. Paul Harvey Jr. Belies it all chronic should be allowed because then he's safe. See, if we allow all chronic pain in the asses to monopolize all those shows, then he can be on like 20 times a day. Well, I'm not making it up until he is true. Well, I think we need to have several of these calls. You'll get in trouble. You'd all tend people who listen to this night to call in. I'm disappointed to stand with what I'm talking to. I thought the stand was my pal. You should have hung up on him. I think maybe standards full of crap. Is that what it's all about? Is that a very tiring day? That guy really used to kiss your butt all the time and all the sudden. Now. Yeah, because I won't put him on the air or be five minutes. I think I'll all, sir. Let me tell you something. Even the most casual listener can testify to this. Any of the chronics. They're your pal. They love you. They think a lot over as soon as you say one time out, you're getting a little chronic. They turn on you like a rat. I can't remember what you were saying. But I know you had a lot of negative things. Yeah, right. I'm serious. Well, I'm good. I'm glad to know that now that stand's going to be doing my vacation with Randy Martin. That's interesting. No, after I go to Batford, I'm the only one that promotes these on the air once every 10 days. They should have hung up on. They should have hung up on. Come on here and continue with the cheap shots. They should have hung up on. No, I stand in the remaining. Nobody's let's go on for four or five minutes. What do you mean? What the hell kind of crap is there? That's the spot. We're the that desperate for calls. I don't know what Paul Harvey's doing. What is his name? Well, he's history on his show. I'll tell you that. I'll tell you. All right, Neil. You'll get more calls. I just want to be the first one. Thanks for stir in the pot. All right, but see. That's what we like. People let stir up a lot of trouble like that. Because that's what this town's all about. I know I'm being a little negative, but I want to live up to my billing. W-I-O-D. Okay, that's called 1029 at W-I-O-D. And I'll tell you what. It's not like what Alex Bennett was here. I'll tell you that. We actually got some calls. Now, did I just, is that, that's not a new one. Is it the one says, Ray, stand. Did I just do that? That's a new one? Hello? Yeah, I listened to the Milky Way. Oh, it was my mistake. I was under wrong one. I'm sorry. That was my mistake. Oh, that's right. I picked him up cold. Isn't that amazing? Uh, do you want me to do it? You listen to the old? Listen to the forever yours show. Yeah, it was. Hold on a second. W-I-O-D. Okay, line check around four. Yes. I could leave followers, name it, phone started ringing hand up mysteriously. Just a coincidence, right? Yes, absolutely. The Milky Way Dark Show has been released. Hold on a second. W-I-O-D. Yeah, there is again. Oh, you know who that is? That's Mr. Radio. He cranks us all the time, because we won't put him on the air. Do you want to put me on hold again? Oh, go ahead. Milky Way Dark Show? Yes. For every yours? Yes. They ripped you all night, Neil. All night, not stand. Stand just... What do you mean, not still? They sat there and let it go on all night? Yeah, he did. I don't understand. Damn, you are a slime ball, okay? He hasn't been on the air for one of those big stokes. Who's the only guy in this town that puts him on the air? The keeps promoting a show. That pretends that, you know, there's something there. That's you. And this guy comes on his sits back and just says no show. So I'm aware of opportunities that he gets on the air. Like the last time he was on a Sunday, I think when the DJ was in here and I go to the store. I turn on the radio. There's IOD on. Here's the DJ ripping a crap out of me. And stand up. He's... What was it? We're not cranky. What was it where he was using? He's... Just... Something like that. Yeah. Well, I was after I heard the call. It encrozened me so horny. Really? Okay. By the way, we're playing the... The cleanup version, so don't anybody get panicking. Okay, because sure, Nick will come and take our license away. We have two openings in Broward now. 524 stand. 524. W-I-O-D. W-I-O-D. Okay. Good. Good. Good. We're in for all the regulars today. Paul Harry will be happy about that. Let's go to Miami. Hello. New. Thank you. All those four are nice. Well, I'll see. This is good. I like this. Get a good controversy going here. That's what it's all about. Standin' not wippy last night. Well, that's something I said. We didn't say he ripped me. They sent me a loud... ...out others to sit back for three solid hours and ripped me an ad. That's fair. That's fair. That's fair. I'll listen to the whole thing and I'll pay good nod. So, I feel... No. Well, listen, that's two to one so far. You're still in the minority here. Well, no. I'll get more votes in that. What do you mean you get more votes? Well, I'm in South Dade. I'm in Homestead. Well, you get like a half of votes. No. I should get four votes for that. Well, everybody at work is crowded. You should get like the sympathy vote for the one down there. Listen, I'm from Tiger Fris. I'm going to come up to specs. I mean, where are you going to go? I'm telling you one thing down in Homestead. Crackers are not something to eat with your child. I'll tell you that. What is it? I'm from Tiger Fris. I'm going to take pictures of you on sale. What do you mean, hour photographer? I work for newspaper and Homestead. You mean, I'm going to be in a Homestead paper? You're going to be on a... Man, I'll be on my display, Miss. You Sheriff Nick. How do you like that? What are you going to see if you want a whole page? All right. God, first it's the Jewish Journal and then it's the Homestead Ledger. No, that's not that news leader. Well, whatever. Oh, I know that one. Yeah, I know that one. Common Easter, Common Easter, Common Easter. No, no, no. But all those Common Easter versus Pinkos like me on a front page. I know. No, we're going to pick you on a whole page. All those baddies are popping up paper. Yeah. The spotlight. Yeah, they read that a lot down in Homestead. Yeah, but it's just... 12, 13, 12, 13. And a lot of Washington. That's from the John Berts Society. It's one of those fascist things. Probably Sheriff Nick has a double subscription. Oh, my God. I think he's calling right now on the other line. He wants to copy of it. Wouldn't surprise me. Well, if you want to see him around here anymore, he's off to be a big star now. Oh, who? And is he like who's going to be on the radio with him? I mean, on the... Oh, sure, they're all going to take a new show on the road. Oh, God. Just all a big fuss. If they would just keep it on the road, that would be fine. I tell you, if you guys who have absolutely no talent, I mean, these people between Governor Bob and this would do do bag up there in Broward. They're going to make them about $50 million for what we've all done. Made them with. They could even make bail the other day. It was amazing. They would have been belly up right now. They'd be the Malestra. They're belly down. One of the other. Yeah. Well, thanks for stirring the kettle a little bit more. Hey, it's Dan was fine last night. He was fine last night. He was fine. He was fine. He had a little credibility up to that point. But when you said that, now I think that's how we're going to line up. Great show. We'll check it out. The other six people will be calling in. Bye bye. See you. Bye bye. Y'all come back now. We have an opening in date, one in Palm Beach, 751. So we shouldn't get any of the big things about Stan Cho, Last night because they were just one of that main people listening. W-Y-O-D. Neil. Yes sir. He was ripping you talking about a spring number of 87. Oh, he's bringing back his old numbers again. Oh, yeah. Well, you know, I used to have an iron chair too, but that isn't going to do me any good. Now, I mean, that's living in the past. He's, what is he going to stop doing that? My mean, he's getting his neurotic as a guy in the weekend. I can't remember his name anymore. That old guy that we have on that old old HMK. Oh, geez. He's bringing 87 numbers. What does that mean? It's spring 87 numbers weird. I mean, he got fired when you went to vacation. That would have mean. So what does that mean? I had a nine share. He had a five. So what the hell is he knocking me for? Yeah, but he came in the inherited all my carts. My whole act, the ACN stuff that used to have it. But what is he all upset about? And what the hell is he talking about? Oh, you know, I don't know what is he doing. What is it? Going out with the ACN. Yeah, I can't believe Paul Harvey Jr. What a turn coat slime ball. I'm the only one that's defended. Everybody else thinks he's chronic and a pain in the ass and a pest. And I've defended him because I feel sorry for people with the pasty complexions. But nobody can go. Like he, you're right. There's nobody like it better. You're right. And I just can be honest. He's his story on his show, pal. He'll be calling. He'll be calling. He'll be on the line somewhere. No, don't let me get it stopped. Yeah, get a life. He doesn't even have a job anymore, does he? Maybe the guy from Condon or him can start a business. There you go. Chronicle America. Chronic pest control. Have a great day, pal. Happy new year. W-Y-O-D. Oh, me, I was right. What was that sound? You sounded almost like Johnny Dark Jr. What was that? Like a little cousin Brucey and drag. Are you gonna hold on? I said what? You were upset. You said that? I was by all I would tell you and I said no. All right, hold on a second. We want to do a little break and I'll come back and we'll go to Barcelona. We'll get pirate and pirate. Well, you see, I have a different philosophy now. And that is if you go and expecting the least and you come away with a win, it's so much better. You know, when you expect nothing but if you expect a win and you lose, then you're real depressed. real depressed. So why start each day expecting, wow it's going to be bad again and then all of a sudden man, Sandberg hits that, I've never seen anybody hit so many homeruns in the first inning and he's just unconscious. There's only going to be one problem. What's the higher than the cubs and three all? What a full cut for the Canadian. Now forget them they're they choke like crazy. Oh they hope they're hot right now and then by August like they did last year they'll be folding like an accordion. But be careful because you also spit up. Not a smoothie. Not a smoothie. Not a smoothie just goes separately. You're gonna see what all she does. 1040 at WIWD. Now you're way to second won't you? Yeah. Okay because we have a very impatient lady here. On channel 4's far away for it? Are you impatient? No. Okay. What is it? Um, Brian Norrcross is coming before? Yeah I know. It's a play with lots of helium. He's been coming to 4 for a long time but he had a wait for his an uncompeted from channel 10 do or run out of whatever was. Oh okay I thought that was something new. And also what happened? It was because you know how he used to do the weather from all these different places like at the racetrack and and he did the weather on channel 10 one time from a tall building. I think there's a hundred biscane are you listening? Uh huh. Hundred biscane tower and he like took off and it's taken all this time for them to get a hold of him again. He was out there like floating out in the space. Uh, maybe to have good year on his side. What is it? Yeah right he could do a little standing. He's a good guy like him. He's got a good sensey and we're a great voice. Uh huh. Uh huh. Right? Okay. Well that was quick. She would like a lurking right sir? Yeah if I like to be a five kick. Oh, I come on let's get back to the bar top. Come on. Let's get back to the other. They got that filthy Levi spot on again man. Boy if what's his name was in town if Sheriff a Nickhead was in town. He'd be really following it about the name that got this filthy Levi spot. Let's ban MTV okay that'll be next. That's the next campaign. Let's get that filthy off RT we said. So okay. You know I like sure. Like let's ban her all the right after the show they have to go by the Nick that comes on. Okay. Then we can ban the show after he will go by the stock and manipulate it on his way to start him to being a stupid star. It says keep your fly button. I'm sorry these provocative spots. So let's go back to the Cubs. Hey. Yeah. Back to the Cubs. What happened to Greg Maddox there? Many of it. Rocky first inning and then he settled down he got listing. Oh, hi was out unconscious for five innings and then the seventh thing just when Harry came back all the sudden Maddox lost it inexplicably. It could be it was. Yeah. Let's go get some stock and tell Sheriff Nick that it's obscene. Then he'll drive the fight through the roof for the lobby rich. Yeah. That's great. That's great. I think Sheriff Nick is obscene. Okay. I think how in his obscene. Yeah. We're becoming the Neanderthal capital. So he used to be the drug capital where the Nick I passed said that was exciting enough. So now between Bob Cox Governor Bob and and Sheriff. Yeah. Slickhead. Now we want to be the Neanderthal capital of the world. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. It sounds like you're out of material. I think he's just so you for today. You didn't know where this scream or he didn't. Oh, but we didn't lose four straight. Yes, sir. Hey, listen. We got out of the and now that we got by. Oh, I mean, we heated lose a game. But we still, you know, beat them in the game he pitched in. Now the possibilities are amazing and Harry's coming back in the second game tomorrow. Got only knows. Even the beach boys are sitting right now. I can hear it. Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I'll get through now. Huh? We don't get ready to kipper. Scream or in kipper. I had to get rid of the k boys. Yeah. Good luck to you. Good guy. We're the one. But like a kipper comes in. What do you mean we? Oh, now he now all the sunny. I'm fired. Oh, you're the pirate guy. Oh, you didn't see that game, though, huh? I couldn't find it. I don't have a blue. I think they blew a six to one lead and then it was seven and they pulled it out eight to seven parts. It's nothing leads. Really? The top of the end. Yeah. Oh my god. Well, it's going to be a long here. In fact, you know, I joked yesterday to check Meyer was going to be out sick because the pirate said, if we can't ensure enough, he wasn't here yesterday. He fell up today. I don't know. He's not here yet. He always will look up with the wounds I think. I see a winner to the leader. Yeah. Well, listen, good luck, sir. Yeah. You'll leave. Okay. 1044 at WIO day. We have an open line in Broward 524 Chuck. WIO day. I didn't catch most of the stands show yesterday because oh my god, it's an asyl tones of rich packed your life in Portland. What the very end and the only negative person who can I ask you a question. How come you didn't invent snotty Susie? Because I have a feeling with your nasal condition. You can wait a million. You can retire. Please. The very end he was saying something about that you don't talk about the ratings and the trends are down. But that was all I heard. That's a lot of crap we talk about the ratings every time they come out. Well, that was the only thing I heard. But I was watching the cubs game. I don't have time for a stand in what's it say. Well, who the hell does forget it? Yeah. In fact, it was funny because Stan called me about two minutes after eight. I had just started my VCR. The tape was rollin. I'm watching the pregame five minutes there when a Harry is in coherent. And he's like tell me about the big stormy drove through to get to work. And I was nice because it was lightning and thundering by me for a few minutes and that stopped. And that was it. And I think he was trying to remind me that he was going to be on like I'm going to turn off the cubs game and turn that on. You know, two bad about that. Wow. He really got to took a fast ball right on the, he didn't get a broken bone. He was okay. But that's the guy that called the home run fair. No. Yeah. That was the guy that called it fair when Wendell Stad said it was a foul. No, he's the guy that called his foul originally. All right. No, no, no, it's not to say you're wrong. It's not you. I see I get sucked in that. It's not the same crew. I think you're mistaken. Yeah. I know I'm not mistaken. Wendell state is not in this crew, sir. It was not the same on fire. Okay, sir. Trust me. I'll bet you a lot of money on that one. They don't change the crews around. Okay. Um, no. Two life crew. Exactly. The decision was on night late last night. I don't want to grab.

I think Nick Maynard have a good idea. 751 WIOD let's go to Miami. Hello. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. I think Paul Harvey will call in today. Slime ball. My money is on him. Ultimate slime ball. I can't believe I was you know from my old. I mean everybody I know just despises his call. I'm like somebody picked up like poison and for some reason because I have a soft spot. I feel sorry for people with pasty complexions. I just have you know not blown them off over the years and he gets the one chance to come on his station and he rips me. And then sits here like some kind of an impudent child and you know and presides over it and savers every moment. Well I'm disappointed and staying here. Well I want to hear it now. You sound like a reasonable person. We've had four calls about it which is a big percentage of the people that must have been listening and you're number five. Now the three guys said that they ripped and stand set and presided over it and savered it and relished it and loved it. And the one woman the other one called said that they were awful across. Now you say as Oprah would say you say what? I say I'm with the guys but I didn't hear the show but I just couldn't. Well what do you mean you didn't hear the show? What's the name? Ben, what the hell are you talking about? I just I'm just listening to what people. You might know what your name Deborah Wilker from a Sun Sentinel. No, just no one just make it a trail comment about things that you didn't hear didn't see and you're a man you're an expert on it because you just you jumped to conclusion that's what you do for exercise you jumped to conclude. I was just given my opinion what the caller said so. We're gonna have you make a home video like Jane Fondes called Jumping to conclusions. Sure you go. I can't believe you you didn't hear any of it and you just want to jump on the bad wagon and repall Harvey and Stan. I had the wish good. This thinking I like your I like you're out of two. Well you know I mean Paul. I like your dad. He is not a control. And I know Paul. And Stan's out of control to bring him in here on the air. I mean just bad enough with DJ and DJ and PJ and DJ and JJ. But I mean Paul and P. H. J. Anybody's got to like a J in their initial is on Stan's show. He even did that show about JFK. He didn't do any well I'm pretty sure I'll be doing a show on L. B. J. That'll be nice. Uh huh. Hey I like that it's not easy to do that. Well your credibility is pretty limited so don't get carried away. Hey what can I say about my next man they suck this here huh? They sure do. So disappointed. They're doing it and hopefully they'll do it again today and twice tomorrow and get out of their system. Well good luck to you. Okay we're on our way. Bye. 1057 a W. I. O. D. We have an open line of day 751 liar 751 W. I. O. D. Let's go to Vodka. Go on. Okay wait a minute was there somebody there? Oh you are there. Hi how you doing? Hold on. Tell me why would you? Oh no. Hold on. What is it? Oh I was at foot. I mean foot rockers last night. Yes. Oh. Is it going to be something I'm going to have to believe by? Oh never but foot rockers. How pretty it sounds pretty needy to me. Oh they have great whey news. Anyway they don't have the news. It's foot rockers. I'm sorry. Monday night the best time to go. All the boys are there if you know what I'm saying. Now I don't. The boys from Bangkok. So sick. You really are your sick person. You do understand that. Are you in therapy? Well yeah. Yeah. Really therapy. How about group thing? Yeah that's what I'm afraid of. Now what is it sir? Yeah I heard part of you. Not nice. All right here now this sounds like a reasonable call even Nick agrees. Don't you sound really really Nick said you're so far you haven't said much. Now here at about five minutes. Well it's more than that lady that called before Mr. Jumpy to conclusions. But I heard some that guess that chronic I was on there and he was talking about I was here such a bad guy and then I heard. Wait a minute I'm such a bad guy. Yes. Paul Harvey Jr said I'm such a bad guy. More less yes. For what? For putting him on the air he's right about that. Well I just caught a good person. I caught the tail end of his comments and the stand with the big thing about his numbers and in the spring of 87 whatever was. I said man you know to see Stan is his own worst enemy. The audience despises this crap where he keeps I've told him this a million times off here. Nobody wants to hear him go back and try to rehash about how he did all this. They want to hear a show. They don't want to hear about how he used to be good. He used to have number two of his shows. Stop talking about like you know once upon a time he used to have talent forget it. Nobody cares about that. But I only think that's like the same guy was from Buffalo comes on and talks about he used to have a 50-year in Buffalo when it was only one station. Who cares? 100 years ago. But I only had a couple minutes and he did go see the whole thing about his numbers and I caught the tail end of some guy. The chronic guy would ever talk about you're not nice and forward to that. Oh. But wow. All right now. You know something? What? Hepatitis has a you know has a habit of affecting your brain if it goes untreated. Do you think? I say have a nice day. Okay well I'm glad we got to the bottom of that. Speaking of hepatitis uh well you can't get I don't think it's hepatitis you get cirrhosis of the liver is now what you get from too much drinking. A Henry Barrow standing by with the 11 o'clock Wild news just a coincidence Wild. Okay hold on. People on the beach hold them down and then sit there man. Yeah let's go get it. Well that's nothing that clean up the street. On the first I'm sorry for skipping in a no skipping zone. I hope you guys don't get on me. Just take a seat out. Go out with a chair. A chair. Yes he was right. All right that's your big pocket. I feel like you're part of an I'm not a foot pocket. I'll ask sorry. Yes look like his good learn. Hit my big dogs on a hot newbie in he was right. Righty night to nine at MBC. Okay 11 o'clock 6 a wio d let's go to the phones again because they're just falling out of the store trouble Miami. Hello. I like buying computers just so I can burn the name. Meet me. Find one. Oh yeah. They make me sick. Or why can't they run over and let it you have your missing your missing one point those sir. You have to put it on before you set the fire. Let's go to Davy. Hey Neil. How you doing sir? All right. Kipa so. Don't they have Starlock a banana. They blew they blew him in my time. Leave me souvenirs. Right. Okay. Just sit around. That's what Linda Blair said. What leave me souvenir. No they blew him in my time. Where's your head was spinning around while she was the peaking piece who followed. Don't remember the X herses. Excuse me. I said sure how a nice thing. Okay we had a couple of people drop off during the news break but for some reason the lines didn't disconnect what open hold on a second. W mild. Yeah like to nil sure hold on sir and one in Broward 524 W mild. Okay hold on a frame. What is it now? All righty. Now I already know that on through the news even 45 miles here are great American sir if you have your green card you're a wonderful guy. Yeah I'm a native. A native for one this town. Yeah boy you must be depressed we apologize I use your for coming in and screw it up your life we apologize. I want to hear more high one. Hold on a second Wild. I know this is neat now after what are you talking about me so much man. What if you throw them you want me to come down to the door and see down with you and I'm about it. Be a big thing. Hold on. Lock it in. That could be number one by the end of the week you do understand that because all these people act like they just discovered that we live in a fashion come to you I've been telling that for years and a oh geez full of crafty so negative you know I don't want to come and take them and put them away somewhere in a big padded cell they'll say oh gee maybe had a point you know maybe we should have leasing. So what is it now? I listen to an hour of substantial all right let's get right to the meat of the matter because this deserves a lot I mean or we hear the stuff back and forth and it's usually a lot of crap but it is pretty interesting that certain people are conspicuous by their absence in this conversation which leads me to believe that there was some serious crap going on here last night. What tale you know homely junior said was that you never let him talk to get his point across that everything that's like I got his for I let him talk more than all the other people on the air back together and I have a guilty conscience about it but my conscience now will be clear because it will never happen the end. It is point across what point. I don't know that's what I was thinking. Some point like the one on the top of the tent. Yeah like when he goes out on the weekend with the guys with his sheets. Oh sanitation workers are here. All right they're my favorite yeah give them the high sign tell number one. Now they're they look like members of two like crew. Really? Yeah. Oh. As fast as they want to be that's the time from the V. S. Oh is I just as you want to be. Well listen you're obviously out of material but you've been a wonderful call. Oh thank you Neil. See you later 10 after 11 at Wiod. We have an open line in Broward 524. 10 524 Nazi. And we'll do a little break here.

the one nine hundred numbers off the year because it's going to corrupt the morals of our and we got sure it's you know I'm not going to get excited about it because we're talking into a vacuum okay nobody in his country gives a crap how did I come become sure we mean how did you become sure we stopped the ballot box how many humans do you have and they're killed the hell as we got to do with humans is a right wing fascist kid we got unions are right wing fascist pigs and brown what happens to make what their ethnic makeup is I asked us to just from a communist country now this is the communist communist I know it I knew it I knew it's a verse of call like this had to come from a communist trace this call George oh anyway the point is people need to wake up oh look look we're just here to entertain people and have a good time and I made up I was you know I was in the shower this morning I was getting my myself just foaming it to mouth I looked just like the billboard picture you know foaming it to mouth getting all up sitting thinking about this stuff and then I thought I'm not going to come in and ruin the show and start getting him this I did that for 12 years it is a waste of time okay call a kids away on spring break they ruin a four-lauter nailer turn into a geriatric toilet pretty soon it's going to look just like South Beach and nobody here gives a crap okay

Let's go to Miami. Hello. I mean, that guy. Did you hear who he's just on, Eraser? Sound like Paul Jr. What is it? Sound briefly. The guy you just hung up on. Sound like Paul Jr. Exactly. Was it? Yes, sir. Can you believe that? Why did he hang up? Why did he hang up? Because he's off the show. For real? History. Acts stabbing two faced, sleaze bags, slime ball, O'Jom ProVocator. What? I heard the show last night. And the only thing I remember that Paul said was Paul. Paul Jr. No, you know, he's your Phil. See, you know, this is a friend of his. No, it isn't. First of all, friend, you probably also a Mr. Radio. No, I don't. Why did you people call up Debbie Ellis. She needs the calls, okay? She has this. I don't know. Who'd lower her demographic cut in half? I met him once to remote. That's about it. And I, uh, problem. You guys got on famously, huh? No. I'll bet. I remember they were flipping through a Frederick's a Hollywood catalog. Yeah. And, uh, he made a crack that you'd like to take it out while you're looking at the guy's in the back of the car, rock. That's all I remember. Oh, I want, okay. Stand thought that was hysterical. And that's it. He's off the show, sir. My history. Just for that? No. That's something new. That's an addition that you see didn't hear the early part of the show. Yeah, but I heard the whole show last last night. That's all he could that song. But he didn't hear that early part of the show. Then how do you know what we're talking about? See, this doesn't watch. Yeah, but I followed you and had you call in and defend them, right? No. How much? How much did he pay? The only thing anybody ever said was stand. Stand with a little bit of sex because you let Bill Codford rip him the other day. And Bill Codford was a guest. What am I supposed to do? Tell my guest what to say? I don't know. And he's a real guest. He's got some chronic flunky like Paul Harvey Jr. Do that. That's all they want? So in other words, stand was a little bit upset. Like a child, he comes on again. The only guy that promotes him starts rip biting the hand that that That leaves him. You just a little bit upset. You know what? Tough cookies, pal. Tough cookies. Cospredo like him. There's a lot of people, though. Like me. A lot of people, though, like me. Well, he's like you and Bill were kissing after it. And said to about it. See, now we're getting to the meat of the matter. Okay. The bottom line is he is still paranoid. And this is to a lot of people like Joey and certain other people who are friends of mine I won't mention their names on the ear who are jealous of the fact that they are doing a good job that they've caught on that I like them, that they ought to dislike them. And they're upset because they want to be doing that show. Well, I have news for Stan. Okay. And Stan's a good friend of mine. I wasn't going to say this. Stan will never do that show. If they have to put the janitor, if they have to put it down. Listen to me. If they have to put dumb virtual on from 2 to 6, they will do it before he'll do that show again. That's not because of me. That's because they don't like him. Okay, sir, if you got it, they don't like the man. Period. Okay. Stan defend you though. When everybody calls in. But I'm just telling you, forget whether he defend it. I'm just telling you the way it is. And he can't spend the rest of his life trying holding a grudge against the guys in the afternoon or anybody else because that's they got nothing to do with him. They're doing their thing. What does he want them to do? Fail to make him happy? And other words, come on and do a crappy show to make him happy? Sir. Have a nice day. 149. It's WIOD. Yeah, I'm beginning to relate to it.
