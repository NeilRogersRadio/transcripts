This is the NBC Radio Network. I'm Mike Anthony. Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by. Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile. But when I listen to your show, you make it my luck as you're. I just can't help me get by my friend. Michael, Michael, Michael, Michael. I'm a very serious man. Okay, Bill Cobbers here. We're going to have a little show face. We've only got two hours to do. We have a lot of spots to get in. We're just in the same reason. I still want to stop on the end of that record of course.

There's a little gift. There's a little memory where he speaks. Bearing gifts. That's what I've always said. What's that? Well, sometimes that's the boss. Like life has me by. That sounds like Disney. Anyway, Doc Holler is here. He's got some great stories to tell. He's been a ripped-u-a-am in Newcast. Aren't you? Listen, I think he's going to show you people who think he just missed your mellow. That underneath that veneer is a carcin' ready used to say there's a vicious nasty backbiting wonderful guy. And also, Bill Cosford, I guess, while the luck again is next showing up today or what? Because next, going to have to call Cosford and tell him, no way Jose. Sorry.

We got the Keynes game in noon. They're playing the Citadel. And then if Miami wins, which we know they will at four o'clock, they'll have a second game. This could be my last show. You know, you're right. You're right. They're praying that the Keynes win today. They said they can't be ball-hean, they have baseball fans. This might be my last show. W-I-O-D. Mine. Mine just said that before. His old note, my box is me. Sure. And also, food. I made sure the food comes at eleven. Oh, great. From American-Stakin-Petis. So whatever you want, and Melvin, and just to help yourself, and we don't want to force it on it. Okay. And also, if Mommy's listening, and I'll see. We leave it noon. I'm taking you home and dropping you, like in a sidewalk. And then I was going to go right to Mommy's for it early lunch. But I forgot my pill. Okay. And when you're old and ailing like we are, if you don't have a pill man, you can't even move. You have no movement. Sure. That's my problem recently. No, most of them are going to exactly. So I'm going to have to go home all the way home up to plantation and back to Mommy's around. I don't know. I'll just say what I feel like in Mom. West Palm Beach. I'm a bill called a show. I'm W-I-O-D. Don't say that. You would take an I-Sherodium. Yes, sir. I'm antagonized. Do you know who this is, sir? This could be your Roger. I have no idea who they'll call this. Exactly, don't. I thought they named the racetrack after. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Don't you? No. I'll get lost. It's not a one to talk to people, though. Who are we going to be? Yes, we're going to be there's only four or five people. Who are we going to be? We're a steam from Hollywood. W-I-O-D. Am I right? Yes. Babies. Babies. Babies. Yes. Glova, Goosepe, what do you mean?

Keep it up. I'm not. Let's just say what a Bill Carter. Sure, hold on, please. Okay? Okay. You bet. Okay, there are already four of you Bill. You go right down the line, go check. I don't look you around. What do you mean? I'm going to drop four calls. Seven. This is in a big time like a QA, and I have a good idea that Mike, Mike, Mike, W-Y-O-D. Yeah, I can offer Bill Carter. Sure, hold on. Mike, Mike? No, I have a feeling. I have a feeling that Bob McKay is taping this. Oh, orders from higher up to make sure that if I say anything, you know, that they consume me for over there. That they have it on tape. That's what the Bill finds thought too. Oh, I don't want to bring that up. Anyway, it's 12 minutes. I hate to interrupt you. We're going to have a lot of time today. And we're going to work out great. This is going to go by so fast. You ought to come back and do it again. You and I, and J, at the melting pot. How about Saturday, 10 to 2? How about that? Huh? Everybody in the building says, hey, good idea. You know, good. No good. Slime ball. I go to the track and so you don't. Anyway, we have eaten it the melting pot as a matter of fact. And now they got something new. They've got the great cheese fondue. Okay, let's say some of these calls. If we don't have a lot of time, we can't open before we take the first call. You must tell. Now people call. Well, when's Bill coming back on here? He's going to be on another station. And I mentioned a couple of weeks ago that he was talking to another station in a market. I say station very loosely. And it didn't pan out because they want to pay any money. And the station of course was WFTL, which might as well be off the air basically. And they were the first person to call me. But they had now, you know, they only person to call. You got to envision big time radio. And the owner King Paul, who of course is the Maven of used cars and all I crap. And they invite to call it a breakfast. They've all a hunches that got the owner of the station and the program director and the operations manager and the janitor and all these people at breakfast at Denny's. And I was my appetizer. Great. Okay. So, I'm going to bring this up. It's an odd series. And my appetizer is great. And the only thing I could say is there was a time not too long ago when I was in eating very much. And now I'm eating like I'm just like a horse. Anyway, to make a long story short because I know you have a lot of calls. We beat it Denny's and everybody is there. The manager, the program director of girls who's like the operations manager, and King Paul is there. And I told my wife, no cereal this morning. Nothing. I'm going to pick out. I am going to get a free breakfast. Well, we go to Denny's. I meet. They all come in. Here comes King Paul. Looking great with his day go leisure suit on and everything. And I'm going to eat right. So they start with King Paul and they say. The waitress said we'd like to order. He says. We're going to toast. He's what we have right. We have a little toast. We've got a new general manager. We've had to go out and have a little toast. And maybe a couple of slice of bacon. But the toast. We go around the table. Everybody has shows. I'm starving. And I ordered. Nothing. You know, you just have no back. Oh, that's right. I was in credit. You know, you get the feeling that like King Paul had a five dollar bill. And his pocket. Like six people sitting at this table. Oh, that was funny. You wanted to make sure that it came like four days. And I was hungry. I mean, I was so excited. The idea of what the offer was going to be. Coconut Grove. Oh, hi. Good morning.

I got 39 is the New York. They took him on the fifth inning and they brought up Kevin Blankenship from the Minorly. He was there, it was a hit to the ball. Well, we don't have a picture for tomorrow's game. Well, don't be there. At least, don't want to be thrown out of there. By the way, the ball was spared by five feet yesterday. I wanted to go into a big thing about that. The cubs telecast cut beautifully. They showed it over to go over again. They put a circle around the ball as it left the park. Fair by five feet. Harry Wendell said is the biggest piece of crap. Whoever stepped out of a baseball diamond. or you take a long time with baseball calls. Don't you know why? It might not be as bad as everyone said. Right. But you know something the highlight if anybody saw that game because it wasn't his pin. The highlight is when Zimmer goes nuts. That that's a surprise of admission. He is the best. Eyes go popping out of his head. He's the best. And you could read the lips too. And he's wearing his hair shorts. Yeah, I like that. He got that Bob Cox here to. Yes.

We did Nick called Bill calls for it and tell him, no way, Jose. And we'll see another time like, uh, don't call us. We'll call you. It just never works out. I think fate has a lot to do with that. You know, that's over. They're her own, really. Still think the hurricane's lost. I came tonight. So, um, but nobody told him. We got the kids coming up and knew. And I want to remind you that.

So far, we're smiling. Or is that something unusual? Um, so we're going to get a big crowd over there. Mark, like a stadium. Can I hit a rupture for a second? Even bigger crowd listening because it's on my time slot and we're Compussed. What is it? Hmm. Somebody asked me to please tell this story about how you and I met. How you can.

Because when I first met you out of skinny head, I'd I'd know your one-himes. No, ho, you lost it. After you met me. After I was in limbo, I was like, I'm right about what I do now. Neil Rogers had a wine green jacket. Jack, I did not have a lime green jacket. Bill tool. Got me a lime green jacket on the trade out in Palm Beach. I was like, I'm sorry. And he used to wear lime green suit. I'll never forget the day we were playing at a pro-Am, a golf tournament. And I was riding with Bill tool, the general manager. He had a great attitude, another great human being. And we're sitting in a golf course, in a golf course. We're sitting in a golf cart, waiting to hit the ball. And he looks over at me. And here are all these celebrities and people playing golf and everything. He says, what are we doing here? Like he was beneath him. I'll never forget that. Are you working with the selling radio operator? No, no business. Bill vines. And my Anthony. Joe Abernathy. Bill tool. Or when you bite the hand of the feed you, you wind up his best.

I have a big turn. I have a big turn. I have a big turn. I have a big turn. Yeah, well, I think you've got a lot of analysts. Yeah, how about Debbie? How about Paul Lyle?

Oh, yeah, she's really fair. Yeah. Yeah. He asked the C.F. He's a cool guy. I can hear his hint of morning radio. Yeah, it's a matter of fact. So Larry can't seem like rubbing. They said it will not have a big turn. I'm not going to be crazy. I'm going to be talking to him. No, because he has a lot of distance out of line. He doesn't have an 800 number. He's a funny number.

The first time I'm feeling for me, said he was 49. Somebody came to work here. He was 44. By the time he left, he was 18. And by now he should be like three embryotic at this point. Now that was what year 19. Well, it was my first year in radio. So the 63 years said. Yeah. That's why he's 70 years ago. So he's 44. That means he was 17 years old. When you work with him in Houston. No, he didn't have any. He's a lot older than that. Because he knew words that I didn't know that nobody that was alive in Tiner 18. Like as I said, like that. He's good. He is great. Isn't that true, man? I'm a little bit hurt. But I would see a real. Okay, hold on. This has been it. We have an opening at Broward 524 Alex 524 WIOD. Okay.
