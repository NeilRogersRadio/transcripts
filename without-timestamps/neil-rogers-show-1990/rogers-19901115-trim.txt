524 Wild in Brower Wild Georgia's busy Good morning! Good morning! Hold on. Okay. Wild Wild. Hello. Okay. Now he hung up. Isn't that great the guy that I just- is he gone? Nice guy. Good morning my ass pal. Unbelievable. Boy I love picking those up cold. You know, it's just a real education in life. I picked those up just as I say y'all. How's Rabbi Sifty doing by the way? Shop it it up baby. I'm dying over here. Well it isn't what I would have played if I would have had it in the machine. I would have played but it wasn't in the machine. Okay 1117 here's a nice lady in Miami. Oh I'm trying something I'm dying over here. I'd like to write things to play at that time. I'm dying over here. Okay. I'm easy. I need to ask your audience. Yes ma'am. Anyone heard Kelly Craig singing. I'm a national anthem at the heat game last. You know they were promo you're on the- Oh and guess who else was on the news last night. I heard someone make mention of it on Rick and Spudius today. And I forgot all about it but I was lucky enough since I do watch Channel 6 news starting at 6 in the BM. They had Jeff Cohen from PizzaLoft was on their last night. One of the silliest things I've ever seen but Jeff got some good play out of it. And they always have to have it was the sports guy Russell Shomuka. That's so dope. Yeah. So dope but he was making a pizza over there. I have no idea what that has to do with sports but- Well, they don't have a lot to do with sports either and offer dollars. Yeah it's true. Hey by the way John where those cinnamon raisin bagels were waiting for John offer Don you do spegg? I'm sorry go ahead. I just wondered if anyone had heard of it. Well they were sure promoting the hell out of it on Channel 4 news last night. Sure. Well anyway I'm not in the chair. You didn't see cry. You didn't see the movie cried. You didn't see the movie cried. Maybe the movie cried baby. Did you? Yeah. I would. Thank God. There's no way. I mean well maybe for me and dollars I'd watch the sunset. Yeah. Two million for me. Okay. Thanks. By the way event, Halcyon and Iliana and Marvin they've worked there butsaw to help us out on this including yesterday and we thanked them profusely. Anyway, event had two checks from over at Flores Joe and somebody else put in one of the $180 bucks a ruptured 23,994 in counting including my check for a thousand that I put in today and the only reason I mentioned that is not to get credit but to try to embarrass some of the other hot shots in the bit like the people over next door. Channel 7 for example make all those big bucks that people who look at us with those condescending looks because they're in TV and we're just a bunch of radio slabs. Right. Right. And of course they don't listen to what they do. The course they don't listen to what they pay no attention to what somebody over channel 7 and over playing Rick Sanchez singing his wedding song or whatever the hell that thing is right because they don't pay any attention to us. They're too big for us like that penny Daniels boy who? Man. Snoody and she ought to have a partner named Judy they could call the newscast Snoody and Judy. I like to siphon knife myself. Let's take a call from Tamarack. Yeah, what's going on today? What's happening? What's going on? Who's going down? Yeah. Oh boy. Look at that. The market made a little comeback. It's only down 3.5 points. We're doing it boy. Good. I just wonder now you know seeing how this is self-flared. It does uh, sights and ice given early bird discount between 4 and 6. Yes sir the bird is the word. All right. The other thing I wanted to know I was just I would have been out of Florida. I got married up Massachusetts. Do you get a chance to see the new picture a Jose can say go coming out of the topless baseball card. I swear to God the truth. The topless baseball card. He looks like he's swinging a bat and a pair of jeans. Oh, excuse me Neil. My right while is attacking my grandma. They were alone. She's not a bone. Okay. Leave him alone. You might do your favor. No, I agree. I don't need that arm anyway. Are you cereal? I swear. There's a topless card. What is that on you? You've probably been up to Boston in the Boston Globe that a picture a Jose is a new baseball card. I'm going to put out. I guess in the next one. You only topless picture a Jose. I be happy to see his woman out the head. Well, that's about to make me sick. He makes me puke. Yeah. I tell you. I guess if you can't make it as a baseball player, I'll try something else. Yeah. So I think I wanted to know how about that consocco candy bar. I bet you they're really sucking that up out in Oakland. Yeah. I'm sure they are. Among other things. Yeah. Probably choking on it. I hope so. I hope they do it. The other thing before I left town, they were all these rumors about they're going to be any more dolphin games and WIOD. I'm dying on the hand. Yeah. I haven't heard much more about that. They're trying to goose the anti-up. That's also they're doing this thing with Y100 and they're pretending that they're bidding on the games. I don't think they've even bid on the games, but they just want to suck more money out of a poor folks here at WIOD. Cuz boy. I got to explore a WIO. There's another station in this market that could ever give them one tenth of the coverage that this got for sick and station gives them. I got to kiss the ground. The WIOD is stood by them through thick and thin plenty of thin. Now they're having a big year and all of a sudden they want to put it under or had me hold us up. The new manage. Come on Tim Robby. Cut the crap. I'd rather watch the Simpsons and listen to Y100. Me too. Naturally with this dolphins. You know, it's a, I don't know. I guess it's an institution with sports talk. I just can't believe that WIOD is. I can't see Hank Goldberg and athletes foot on the same show. You know what? That's true. I can't even see athletes foot on radio at all. Exactly. All right. Well, in the wallet, you get on to some other brow collar. Okay. Have a great life, sir. Yeah. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. See you. 11. 22. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12. 12, 12. 12. 13. 12. 12. 14. 21. 13. 12. 12. Four. 14. 14. 13. 16. What's this beam? Bob from Cooper City. No. I thought you were North Carolina. No, I never moved. Well, what was that call we had? You were North Carolina with a banjo on your thing. That wasn't me. That was uh. Well, where the hell of you disappeared to? Here is a man who just moves around so fast because I guess the laws always chasing me was a circuit city. He was at power 96. And then I was at United Airlines United Airlines. Now I'm back in that circuit city. I'm everywhere in a plantation. Yeah. Unbelievable. Great place, by the way. I'm at both places, by the way, right now. I put in my two weeks of United, so I'm at both places. I'm going double duty. Well, thank God, you don't work at Eastern Bob. No. What we've asked about you every now and then, but they all now shamed, you know, shamed from Cooper City. I don't think so. Because shamed came by a remote the other day, claimed to know you and claimed to know Alan and claimed to know Harlan and everybody. Well, we were quite famous from the old they did. Harlan of course is doing 20 years up at Rayford. He's okay. He's working at Brands Mart as a salesman. He's doing good. Harlan's working at Brands Mart? Yeah, he's making more money than you. Boy, I hope they take a lot of inventory. He's doing crazy over there. Wow. People are matured and straightened out. Yeah, right path. Even at notorious stem came by the other day. Boy, it changes name to warts because strawberry is playing with the Dodgers now. Okay. So he's doing straws backwards. Well, maybe I should take it back when I said we all matured. Most of it. Yeah, some. Well, give him 10, 20 years. Yeah. But he gets to be 15. He'll be okay. He speaks highly of you Bob. Great. So what's going on Bob? Well, he might read, are his Bob married yet everybody wants to know? No, it's going on five years of going out here. Still with Michelle, of course. Of course. So starting to hold hands now, it's getting really serious. Yeah. Anytime that will be married, just give my bank account over $100. You know, like it hasn't been in a couple months. Really? You know, no way. Well, we have a rabbi site that I feel be over to your house when you have your first babies to do a little discount number for you. Well, I don't think twice is, I don't think that would be double jeopardy. I already had no. Not for you for the baby. I'm talking about it. Oh, okay. Although in your case, it couldn't hurt. Well, Bob, it's great hearing from me. This is a real tweet. Well, I'm going to get my check for a Camille sauce in the mail today. I'll just today if you can believe it. I talked my mother in the given check to Camille sauce. Oh, she speaks highly of it. Oh, no, no, no. I'm dying out of it here. Oh, I don't think I can handle it. Your mom who thinks that I'm like, uh, the devil. Man. Yeah, she's put it in there. Unbelievable. Oh, I'm twisting, but she gave in. Well, sooner or later, we all see the blight. Well, I got to even even more shocking news for you. The career of choice that I'm going to go into ready for this radio airtime sales. I was with a power 96 and now I'm getting my sales experience over there. But that card in there. Sales people are. I don't have the card that fast. I just dropped the mic on a floor when you said that. That is just incredible radio sales. What you worked at powerless 96 for wattenship? Yeah, and the sales department. I understand that Bill Tanner used to chase you up and down the hall. Is that just a rumor? Bill Tanner. You never met Julie. I can go on and on. Really? Yeah, that's quite a place over there. Very exciting. Well, God, listen, we sure, uh, you know what they say here at WIOD don't you, Bob? Because I can't find the card that you're thinking about. That's a sales people are Isles. That's correct. Uh, you got your finger on that button for the, oh, I got my finger on a Bob. Because in closing, I heard Johnny Dark State to my identity. Don't drop to the coast. Oh, I feel like I'm here. See you, Bob. Bye. Bob from Cooper City, boy, they sure all come back to roast sooner or later. Don't they? That is a shocker. And when he said that his mom is donating to Camilo sauce, you could knock me in. It's almost enough to make me watch the Simpsons, but not quite. Well, here's the guy I want to talk about, Cribabies, right? Hello, yes, sir. Yes, sir. I think you missed the plan a little bit. John Rogers, you can hear us by also. He's a little rage. But I think if you had watched it in it, it's entirely. You're the senior's a great spoof of those juvenile joint removed in the 50s. I couldn't, I just couldn't get through that much of it. I mean, I got through about 15 minutes and it was just so. And the people were so haluscious looking other than Johnny Depth. I mean, Johnny always looks great, but these other growth test, those, those pigs that he had in a car with a man with a, oh, fat gross with a lipstick and a hair and a guy's with a, with a, with the spit curl. Oh, it makes me want to just want to puke. You want to move to Miami Beach and spit all over everybody. Now Johnny Depth, they're a great, beautiful scene right. I was terribly in jail for our sprux. Yeah. I'll tell you what. I'm going to send in $25 to Cameroa. Yeah. And there with a little note, if you watch Cray Day, the innocent tired, he off and in another 25. Oh, that's not enough. Well, you see, but I'm just a regular guy doing a regular job. But you can take up a collection from all your pals over there. Make it, make it 100. For 100, I'll watch the whole thing. 100 and you're doing it. Right. Okay. You got to deal. And I'll watch it too. Thank you. Okay. All right. 1133, a WIOD. Mr. Hotshot, Mr. Morning Personality.

Some of those people at Channel 7 ought to be dropping checks over here like crazy. Or we're going to play the whole rick satches tape. You've seen him on Channel 7 youths. First, as a two bit reported. Now, as a two bit angry that wears more makeup than Tammy Faye Baker and Mary Kaye combined. Rick Sanchez Singh.

Okay, let's go. Now is that a rick and put the spy report? I know. Hi. I do. Great. Didn't hear any reports on the hit. What's he after that? No, I did not. I keep asking all these questions. And these people as you know have their own agenda. They don't. They're just don't respond. It was five minutes from our house. We were listening to the radio. So we said, let's go. And we went to commercial and 441. Yeah, commercial and 441 at the mobile station. Yeah. On the corner in the grass. A guy laid out on a blue tarp covered with cat litter, dog food, cat food, tuna fish, ice cream, you name it. Oh. It was disgusting. Gross. So my little three year old dump the can of tuna and oil all over him. Mm. Some little kid dumps his thing of strawberry milk all over him. And he was begging for more money. He said it wasn't enough. Well, what do you mean more money? How much did they give him? I think they gave him $125. Well, he should give at least 50 of that to Camelos house. Are you crazy? You're bad. My girlfriend was trying to suck up to Marvin. But he was just running around with the phone. Yeah. Yeah. That's Marvin. Roads. He's healed of hair. Yeah. Pretty funny. There. Cop. We had a picnic. We had a Miami cop. We showed up over at Flores yesterday to get a slice of pizza or something. Totally ignored us. He would look at us. Pay no attention to us. We were really mobbed at that point. A lot of people doing our thing in there. And just too hot for us boy, wouldn't dignify that. What was the phrase yesterday that obscene bastard? Mm. Wouldn't dignify me by looking in there. And certainly wouldn't cough up a few bucks for Camelos house. Mm. He's probably one of the guys that arrest all the homeless every year when a convention comes. Oh, well, some of them just don't want to have fun. Yeah. Listen, I know you don't take requests. But played a thing yesterday. It was so funny. It was the big, important thing with the hemorrhoids. No, that's not the important. It's Bob and Tom again. Oh, well, it was great. You got to play it again. My husband didn't hear it. And it was great. Is your husband listening right now? He is right now. Well, it's in the machine right now. Is that service or what? It's great. That's our motto with Wild. Do you get service to your unyola dream? All righty. Or else. See ya. I am sick and tired of this commercial where the lady comes on and says, My son told me about preparation age for my hemorrhoidal symptoms. Now, why should I listen to him? Well, because he's also a doctor. None of guys. Even if I was a doctor, I don't think I want to be examining my mother's voice. I don't need the money that bad, ma'am. I guess that's every kid in med schools dream come true. Does he bend on my mom? Let's see what you're pulling. No, if you want to, Bob and I can tell by looking at you, you do. You know what that commercial should say. You want people to believe it? She's saying, my son told me about preparation age for my hemorrhoidal symptoms. Now, why should I listen to him? Oh, because he drives a truck across country. And he's got piles hanging out of him like a trumpet grapes. Yeah, sing it again. Well, he is incredible. And he never extensions man. He does it for me. Highly up. Hello? Yes, sir. Oh, yeah, no. What's up? How you doing? This is Rick and I'll hear. Oh, yeah, Rick. I was thinking, you know, why? Oh, yeah, come on. See your Camille House. What is it?

Okay, 10 till noon at WIOD. We have an open line in date and one in Brower. It's 751 WIOD and date. How come he keeps walking around with that damn Rick and Suds T-Share?

I'm going to helicopter party. Well, we're watching him fly over the communistas. Not just news reporters. There's police helicopters. Oh, and they're probably going to Rick Sanchez. Well, he's helicopters. Oh, they're probably going to Rick Sanchez. Well, he's going to be a real remote. It's going to be doing a remote from Havana. So he's going to be the dictator. Yeah, that would fit him perfect. Guess who he's here also. Sally Fitz. Well, see, we're close to home. We're right. I'm proud of it. Tell the little tremor. Yeah. Looked around. He's going to be a little bit. Yeah. Yeah. That would fit him. Yeah. That would fit him. He's going to look a little tremor. Yeah. Looked around. And I saw her over there. You thought we were having an earthquake, I bet, huh? There's a guy's truck here. I'm not even going to dignify him. 655, 9463, 655, Rick Sanchez is gone. Oh. I told you, Sally gets excited. She starts trembling when Rick Wink said her during the channel 7 news. We got a bunch of checks from over there a channel 7 today. Have they come in yet? And Rick and their check and dropped it off at our front desk? No? No checks from anybody a channel 7 today. Who are making all that big money? That they're driving all these big catalax in the back parking lot back here? That makes my Corvette look like an old, the used Volkswagen once driven by Ted Bundy? Boy. And Denise White isn't even there anymore. She was a nice lady. And her husband too. And they coughed up. They had to embarrass them into it, but they coughed up a hundred bucks a piece last year. I'm trying to remember if anybody else over there coughed up any money for Camilla's house, huh? Oh, we don't listen to that. We don't have time to listen to radio here. We're important people. Well, I'll busy doing penny dangles here. Do this. You cheap bastards. Make me sick. Pembroke Pines. Good afternoon. How are you? When is this? I had the uh... Your friendly station, W.I. O.D. I had the information on the spill and Hollywood Park, but two people. Yeah, and this is Super Dave and get lost. We already got the information. We don't need any more calls about the spill. We don't need any more excuses for Super Dave or Mr. Radio Ormester G to be calling in. Okay. Enough is enough. There's an open line in Dave County, 7519463, Bale Harbor. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. This is Bauer before the calling. Wow. I'm impressed. I'm so impressed. The Rick Sanchez may start singing again. Well, that's what I'm going to talk to you about. Every time you play that, the wind stops in the birds disappear. Yeah. It's unbelievable. First time I played it all the birds lifted their legs. Exactly. I'll be honest with you. I've never noticed a bird lifted slug before. They usually just kind of like drop it. I would be embarrassed to show my face on a TV. Can't tell. Anyway, if you happen to grant the cross-wreck in the park and give me a trivia question once. Yeah. It's a three weeks ago. How do you move? I've stuck on Channel 7. Well, I want a bad break. That is. I blow my brains out. I'm supposed to be squealing out anyway. Mark is sound three points. Yes. He was talking about the sound of the Georgia and he thinks that it's a... Valdosta. Valdosta. Valdosta. That's what he said on TV. Well, I have a seven-year-old that were watching that day. I was one of them. He's a wonderful remake of the sound. Yeah. But he once had lunch with the Dell. Did he? Yeah. That's nice. I have a wonderful day and go, though. Zygazan. I will get back to you. See ya. Okay, bye-bye. I'll get back to me. What does that promise? 1249. It's been a very, very energetic Thursday here at 6.10. W.I. O.D. Well, you got to space it out. And you got to look carefully and see which machine I still say. You know, we're kicking ass over here. Don't you think it's time we had that other triple deckerup here at I level. I've never in my life worked at a radio station before where the carts run the floor. They're like below waste level. They're like almost on the floor. And that's fine. We can use those three, but we can keep stuff in there that we play all the time like that. But for up here, I level it would be nice to be able to see three more. Right up here is an ice spot for it right there, Mitch. Come on. It's at least you guys can do for all the lunches we've fed you. Whoops, sorry. Mobile and Oakland Park. Not in Oakland Park anymore, Neil. Well, you once were anyways. This isn't what he is it. No. Are you going to want to remove in Broward County, so people in Broward County can get your tape? Of course, sir. Don't panic. We're going to be at the specs and saw grass on Wednesday, December 5th. We're also going to be at the bizarre, but I can't tell you the day because it's not 100% yet. We're going to be doing all kinds of stuff in Broward and it did. And any damn place that'll have us. The one in Oakland Park? The car? The what? Yeah. Okay. Another thing on that policing you talking about. Yeah. The people agree with you on that. As far as them given out old tickets and not. How could anybody listen? How could anybody not agree? Do you mean to tell me? And I'll tell you one of the greatest scams that ever came down in the history of the US as far as traffic and law enforcement is I 75. That road is two years old. They're now repaving it or allegedly repaying it for the third time. There is no construction. There's no work going on out there at all. They put up the 45 mile an hour speed limit on this big beautiful 10 lane highway. And all they do and they keep that even on a night on the weekend. There isn't a dog out there. There's not a piece of equipment. There is no even nobody even pretending to be doing construction. And they sit there and when they feel like it, they go out and enforce the 45 on. Now isn't that a tremendous piece of law enforcement? Like shooting fish in a barrel. Who's going to go 45 or 50 miles an hour on a big super highway where you should be able to go 70. The speed limit. There is 65 all the time. You should be able to go 70 on that road. And they're writing tickets over there protecting the public. And that's where your goddamn tax dollars are going ladies and gentlemen. Write down the toilet. Well Neil is no money and taking care of crack dealers. That's right. And it's dangerous too. If the income is getting you ticket. Dangerous. Go lap the same. Have a great day, Pa. Thank you, Pa. 1251. Yeah, you used to remember the days when the police officer was your friend. Always teach your kids police officers your friend. Boy, what a joke that is. What a laugh. And it's not the individual in Washington say. Some cases it is because we still have a lot of rednecks and Yahoo's who get it. That line of work simply so they can act out their prejudices in their stupid Bigger tree, okay? But I don't think that's the majority of people are getting along Forcement. But the politicians and the higher ups in the Nick Navarro's and all these other Right wing fascist pigs man. All they want to do is wheel power and oppress the hell out of the public. And run a little police state run their own Gestapo. And so if the public doesn't have the same wonderful gracious attitude about people A law enforcement everybody don't blame us. Look in a mirror. Pigs my Amy flakes. Okay, that's where we're going to be Saturday. I can't wait. Volca. Yeah, it's nice to night report. He does a fine show. I don't know if it's worth $300. He does a great show. Who? Sight the knife. Oh, sight the knife. Yeah, he and his. How do you know? Well, I've seen many of these. Sounds like you came out on the short end of the stick, pal. Trust me. Yeah. It's another naval. But he and we he he does a 20 year checkup. He asked anybody in the. In the group for the year. 20 year checkup. Yeah, if you need a 20 year checkup, you'll be glad to provide it. Yeah, oil and the loob two no doubt. That's right. And then he brings Rick Sanchez along and he sings sunrise sunset. It's an incredible performance. Well, that Rick Sanchez. I'm telling you, I'm so emotional about that. I can and you know something to show you how oblivious these people are next door here. Do you know the setup here with these two buildings? Yes, I do. Channel seven and Wild. Once upon a time many years ago were owned by the same company. Right. So they built this complex here and we are side by side. We even have this walkway that connects the two buildings. We share a big common park. And then park a lot in the back. We have matching Marquis out in the front and front of the building. Once the channel seven, Wild and yet those people are such a bunch of snobbs and assholes over here next door. When you walked your car in the parking lot most of them won't even look at you much less Speak to you. I have never in my life encountered. I mean, a people a channel four most of them are real nice. They're friendly, same with channel six. But these people over here channel seven. And they think they're due to don't stink man. They are just pathetic. I don't know why because that shows they put on the news as horrendous. It's the way it's an embarrassment. It's not the news. It's like a like a bad play. Yeah. And we'll you said that you should be on by the same. And one was WCKT and the other was WCKR. That is correct. That's right. That was back in the early. What a guy we got here on the phone. This man is better than Shylock home. What a memory I have. Yes sir. But that's what Sally said. Yes. The question about the commos house. The t-shirt that you have. Yeah. There's no mention of the cubs. Is that because you can't use their logo? No. It's because I made them take it off of there. Because there are a lot of people who are metz fans and other fans. I don't want to force them to run around wearing their cubs logo on there. And I like it. It wouldn't just play right. I see. Okay. Because I want to be Mr. Fear. I understand that. But not too many more metz fans. You know, in strawberry, less day. They're now in the woodwork where they belong. Yeah. With the termite. With Keith Miller. Have a great day. How do you? A pig we're porting for Lauderdale. We're outside. They eat by. Do you know? You're going to be bad. You'll make your thing. Cut. Cut. I'll decide. South Miami. Hello. Hey. How are you, Neil? Okay. You know what? It just takes things you've been talking about. Yeah. Have you ever thought that the cubs, the pigs, they take the past of least resisted. Why should they go out and fight crime when they can just write tickets? Let me say it again. The individual cops don't make the decisions. It's the upper echelon. See, it's high visibility. And that's why they do these things where they bring the cameras along, like Sheriff Nick Today was doing the ULG at this poor guy's funeral. And he don't even know who the hell this guy is. Okay. But as soon as the cameras are there rolling right away, he's there to put on a big acting. Get all emotional and play Mr. Concerned. He's a piece of crap. Okay. Anybody who doesn't know that is a moron. You're right. You remember when when Martinez was when he was running for election four years ago. He was all this law enforcement, this law enforcement bat. And then when he got in, he said, okay, well, the way we're going to do this is higher a thousand highway Patrolmen. Now to me, that's not what we're looking for. Oh, yeah. Let's protect the public by right now. A lot of tickets, man. And not only that, they don't even get the bad drivers off the road down here. So it's a joke. Doesn't matter. It's a joke. Just right in business. All it exactly. But they could have just as well instead of higher a thousand highway patrolmen. Higher 50 good detective to find a murder in Gainesville. Let me tell you, the government in this country is so screwed up. It's pathetic. I mean, why should, why don't they hold a national lottery? Listen to me. Why don't they hold a national lottery once a week for the next year? And raise the money to bail out the SNLs. Why should you and I and all the other taxpayers have to bail out the SNLs? I mean, if Croger Foods do up the street goes out of business. Are we going to have to bail them out? It's a business. Okay. So let's raise the taxes so we can bail out the SNLs because all these people were screwing the hot of the public including the president's brother and whoever knows well. Well, they've got a big one over on the tax. Yeah, the people are a bunch of more. It's too busy with the Simpson. That's what America's all about as the Simpson. Well, they're too shallow. Yeah, shallow is the word. More ons. Don't say shallow. So a man be a family. So they're more ons. They're dumb. How much idiots? They're more concerned about what it says on a front of globe about Tom Cruise is a Cruisin in the T-room or something. Who the hell cares? With Marlon Brando and who's on our city tonight sitting on the edge of the couch acting real Horny, who cares? That's right. Put our city back on a moon and don't give them a man. I'll put it back to my favorite Martian. You go when you go to these big cities like California, Hamburg, and Brown Martian, he's my favorite. I'm a settle 10. What is it? I say when you go to these large cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, they don't have time to be worried about this. Right? They're on Channel 7 News. Yeah. Oh Rick, came out you. Oh Rick, came out you. Play that please. They don't get much butcher than Rick Sanchez. No, being much. Have a great life. Thank you. See ya. What are we getting all excited about today? We're not going to change anything anyway. But we're venting today. We're venting our nasty, ugly, twisted, grotesque spleen. Ooh. W-I-O-D, Georgia spoken after your lunch stogi. Hello? Yes, sir. Hi, this is Nova. Nova? No, sir? Sounds fishy to me. Hello? Nova? Yes. Is that a name? Yes. Or is that like a state? So, um, I got a wrap for you. A wrap? Like a thing? A what? I saw. This is the wrong show. We don't do wrap that's unriken suds do wrap. The first amendment was a free name of speech. That's what you said it did in the evening. I like the party and have a good time. W-I-O-D, I'm getting ready for the next amendment. Thank you. Okay. Good one. Can't believe Rick Sanchez actually called in. Usually they don't respond to it. Am I right about those people at Channel 7? Now you haven't been here that long. But did they speak to you when you go out into parking lot? Did they even look at you? Not much. But just stuck up, pregish, morons over their next door. We hate you people like poison. But if you bring some checks for Camilla sauce over, we'd like you a lot better. And we won't even key your car. Boy, you know that big Cadillac that it ends in drives? I got a key for my Porsche, well those real long ones. Oh, that would have job that would do on that baby. Man. I'm not just talking about the door. I'm talking about from the front headlight all the way to the tail. How's your tail, it? Wow. Guess who I just spoke to? Rick Sanchez. Bring it over and check tomorrow for Camilla sauce. The bigger the check, the sooner we'll stop playing that thing. Now, he's easily got a sense of humor, okay? That's because he drank a lot of Cuban coffee this morning. Here's my story. It's bad but true. About the worst drivers I ever knew. I call them frogheads, because all I can see are the tops of the little greyheads, squinting through the windshield at me. That's it. The hood and the hood. She'll be the wildest baby. The hood and the hood. She'll be the wildest baby. Da da da. She'll be the wildest baby. Da da da. She'll be the wildest baby. Frogheads. You drive me wild you. Frogheads. You're driving 10 miles per hour. You're falling hate. You know I love you so much without you. A life would be so bland. Frogheads. The dashboards in your face. You frogheads. Your brains are not in space. You vote frogheads. You really don't know where you are. And you don't. Don't want to do it. You're living 10 miles per hour. She'll be the wildest baby. Da da da. She'll be the wildest baby. Frogheads. You don't have any worries. Frogheads. You can't see that I'm in a hurry. Frogheads. That's because you can't see it all. Frogheads. You really drive me. No. Sometimes I feel like crying on my truck. Getting behind you to keep your butt. Oh, we like to keep your butt. Frogheads. You're driving is a joke. Frogheads. You make me want to choke you. Frogheads. Don't you know your turn signal is on. And has been for five or six miles now. Getting dead is she'll be the wildest baby. Do you? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Frogheads. You really drive me. No. Sometimes I feel like crying on my truck. Getting behind you to keep your butt. Oh, we like to keep your butt. Frogheads. I really don't mind you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. And the Frogheads. You wasted all my time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm Frogheads. Just doing not be a Froghead too. But I won't know what to do. You can be Frogheads. Yeah, I'm going to be a Froghead. You and me will go to be Frogheads. So I can drive you crazy. Yeah. Well, I guess you've sent that to me in a million years. Lanny Sherman is the guy who did it. Thank you, Hal. We got some mail today. Look at that. Some serious mail. Dave Barry. One of my favorite people at the hero. One of the biggest Yahoo's since they invented Yahoo Junction. It says me this tape said I thought you might add, of course, the timing was perfect for today. Talking about the great drivers and the frogs. You never get those, boy. All those people were hunched down with their head up to the bottom of the string. We'll go in 20 miles an hour in the middle of the middle lane on I-95 of the turnpike. Never, ever get pulled over for going to slow and obstructing traffic in the causing accidents. And has it as driving and being a bunch of crap. But boy, go eight or nine miles an hour over the speed limit on the knob hill road man. Your ass is in raford. Fry him. Yeah. Bunch of pigs, bunch of phony baloney. Who the hell you people kidding anyway? Oh, by the way, I don't like the way you look so you're probably drunk in your license. 20 years. Man, nobody in his town's got any balls to stand up against. That's the problem with this country. They're all a bunch of whims. I can't they be butch like Rick Sanchez. First, it took the little girl. Your mother serves like him. Man, it was that the priest. Unless you my child. Now, it's taken over the refrigerator. Honey, would you like a little parquet, Marjorin, on your muffin? I did. What was that, honey? I said you want some parquet. Fire. Honey, I think the top on the table just talked. You better believe this. Metro Golden Marjorin presents, Xorcist 4, starring Molly McButter and introducing Polyunsaturated. As the torment at Housewife. Honey, what you've asked about it, please? Oh, boy. Rick, this will never be the same. You will believe it's not butter. And it doesn't stop there. Hey, it's me, Flango. You're close, I'm sorry. As this is for now melting at the Citadelplex 2, plenty of free parquet. Fire. 126, the WIOD, where Rick Sanchez, sings his heart out for Sally. We have an open line in Broward. He said he and his wife were on the floor when they heard that, and if they'd ever get up, people stop talking about him. Davey. Neil. Yes, sir. People don't aim money to commit a house. Yeah. I haven't heard you say that you're going to donate one dime yet. Why are you wrote out a check for a thousand dollars this morning, sir? Okay, take it easy. Okay. That's shut them up fast, isn't it? Where's your check, asshole? We have two open lines in Broward 524WIOD. Miami, hello. Mr. Rogers? See? Yes, Miami's one could I go in, and wait a minute. Your name is what? One, Coyado. One, Coyado? And I represent Iruc the records in Central America. See? And I understand through the great pine I heard that you have a new style at the old Bryson start. Start. This name is Rick Sanchez? Yeah. Yeah. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. Mr. Rogers. This is Neil Hitzson, one in the middle. Yeah. We want to create a package. Don't you understand? Rick Sanchez. And Gil Garden. So we could think, he wouldn't make it through the night. How's that? Shake it, Lush? Yes, sir. Okay. And they're going to be good to me. We're going to be called a lean bar's rush. Ha ha ha. Outstanding. Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. I went to peace alarm Saturday. Peace alarm? Peace alarm. Was it leaning? It was great. It is great. And I want to say something to that Russell Shamuka over a child since. Not only to the pie, you make look like Drek, but you know, Jeff does a great job over there. Stick to the sports. You don't do too great on that, Ross, but the pizza was weak. Neil, Jeff was great. He came to my hand. I told him I came all the way from Miami because I did. He's a great American. And he's Spanish, too, by the way. His name is Cohen. Is he? Yeah. Hey, Neil. I happened to have a satellite. And I get to see your friend, Larry Ken. Oh, yeah. On the one you five, one. Yeah. You see the CNN. See the one where he's got his finger up. The nose searching for his brain. That's my favorite. And I got to tell you this, you didn't see this one. When they have the Gulf crisis the first week, he had a like five experts on them. Nobody wanted to see next to him. They had like a round table. And he was, you know, when they were there, Oh, this looks like this Larry King day. That was last night. Was it really? Yeah. That was glad. He was saying that because this guy called from Mary's owner, saying that they had a Martin Luther King holiday. And he went crazy. So while every time he gets those panels, I know we seem to want to see next to my wonder why. Come on. They said back a little bit. You flat this very bad. Yeah. I got to see cry baby. Yeah. But I was with my girlfriend, so I didn't get to see the whole thing. Well, you're lucky. Believe me. I guarantee you had a lot better going on with the girlfriend that he did watching. That movie was the pitch. You know, he was. I mean, only pseudo and light. So it was a great spoof for this. It was crap. It would that mean that people look like, but they might armpit on a bad day. Yeah. And I saw, since we have a satellite, I saw the first power. That's the one you're talking about. Yeah. Would the Mexican guy be in the psychic? Yeah. And the, and the, and the, and the, and the, and it's this, it's awful. Yeah. The way I mean, it was okay. It was, it was for a press. It was okay. Then you get to the ending. And it was like all of them. They don't know how to end the movie. Yeah. So like some people don't know how to end the call. Yeah. Now he was okay. Just couldn't resist. You know me. 130 at 610. W.I. D. And let's go to West Palm Beach. Hello, Neil. Yes. I just cut down here from Montreal in my, in my, in my, Well, that's your funny accent for French Canadian man. You sound more like you just got like Greek to me. We, we just came down in our trailer. Yeah. And sounds like he just came from Iraq with a band you wanted to. You know, sedan by the chance. We're not, we're not sedan. We, we all out here on 95. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not. We're not getting free. We're not getting free. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So take the phony accent back and see how to jump. 1131 at W.I.O.D. We have an open line in date County 751 and one in Palm Beach. I tell you the Palm Beach line. Not only is it neurotic, but the worst calls in the history of, Broke, even Mark Coney is embarrassed. Carl Springs is gone. That's our clicking line. Of course. Miami Lakes. And now. Yeah. Are you done? Okay. It is the end of your Miami Lake. I met you over at the spectrum. That was a pretty good remote. Oh, the one last week. Yeah. One last week. Great. I'm sorry. I enjoyed it. Donates are my to come. It was worthwhile. Fabulous. I'm going to be touched on that 755 deal. I got nearly about two months ago doing 65 at one o'clock in the morning out there. Oh, man. You were really endangering the pubic. I'll tell you that. Yeah. I think I thought about a bunch of crap. You know something in a people in the state are like a bunch of sheep. They just sit back and they accepted. That is the biggest scam and all weekend. I mean, let's face it. People are going places and doing things on a weekend. All weekend long. There is absolutely no construction on that highway. I mean, I don't even know if there is any at the rest of the time. But on a weekend, there is none. Zero. And I still have those 45 mile an hour. What is the rationale for the 45 mile an hour limit on a road that's like 10 lanes. Beautiful, repaved highway. What is the rationale? How do they defend that? It makes no sense. I thought I went to court to fight the ticket. Yeah. And then I lost. Based on what? They said they were posted for 45. But for what reason? You can't just come up with some arbitrary sp- they could put us in sign up there. It said 10. But there's got to be a reason. It's a super highway. Because there is supposedly construction which I have yet. There is not. There is no construction on a weekend or at night on that highway. And if it was 115 in a morning or whatever, that's a crop. I would take it to the dam Supreme Court. I would stick it up. San Radeo Conor's pantalones. What I would do. I can nail down a Reno 2 way. Put that ticket where the Mundo and shine. One of the subjects is a Rick St. has had anything to do besides staying in a play golf. I started weeping when I heard that. I just get so damn goosey eye. You know, I see every day at a week playing golf on a rantry golf course. Well, he has a lot of frustrations today. He got a few head of sit next to Sally and try to keep your chair from toppling over. You'd be able to a lot of pressure too. He said the floor and at whole studio just constantly shaking feels like the earthquake all over again. Well, I need you got a great show and I just want to call Barbara Brear and search the douchebag. Take that ticket to the Supreme Court. Take it right to El Presidente, okay? I'm on my way. And Tom the Stickett and Barbara's wig. See you. Get in the second tide of all this crap of people being harassed. We pay their salaries. Okay, that's the thing that you don't understand. You pay them to protect us and they're sitting out there like the enemy in the lurch waiting to nail your ass. Okay. And now like the I 75 deal. They do it even under bogus. I mean, that's not even a legitimate deal. 45 on a super highway. Lots of construction going on out there. I want to clock it a morning man. They're really doing it. Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. Speaking of Rick Sanchez, I promise that he goes out on a too low heat. Don't say don't know. Yeah. What is it? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. If you notice the lyrics on that. He's great. I really don't know. Oh, wait a minute. What is he saying at about? We better listen to that more carefully before we continue playing it. I don't know. I don't know. I come every time he reports on our TV. I come to you. It says it's please roll down his tie on down and he's sweating like a pig. Because he's sitting next to Sally. Another thing. Yeah. Whatever happened to his other game. Oh, there's that dinner burger out there in a hall. Man, I'm going to get him when I get off the year that man. Whatever happened to his other game. You know, I want to tell you something. That's a change to subject. But that sales department back there is so hell bent on putting me in a grave. You know, they're selling all this business now. But why not let me stay alive and time to finish it? You know? Good. It was up to them. I beat in 17 meals a day. I'd have a stroke every 20 minutes. Not the kind that Sanchez is singing about either. Whatever happens to the other game. What happened to the allegations of Sanchez's allegations of involvement with San Pedro? He has a touch. He sent San Pedro to see Fidel. Yeah, right? They haven't offered we couldn't refuse. I'll just couple of our shots. Who knows? Another thing. What's the life of our lifeline record of the rate is in the distance? Do you know? I haven't got any idea. Call up sports talk for those kind of rural, like heavy duty questions. Thank you. I'm just a novice pal. There he goes. Thank you. Good bye. Like brushes me off after all I'd yuckin' it up. Like you don't know anything. I'll call Hank. Okay. Well, same to you, pal. Don't forget Hank starts Tuesday night 8-11, Wayne Newton probably be here. Mobile in Miami. Yeah, how you doing, Neil? Pretty good. Yeah, listening to Rick's thing that's thought maybe think of how great that absolutely in the world with you, with a new girl singing, shakin' loose. Jones. Wow. That's lovely. I'm moist. I've tell you what, then we're going to put this on the hit parade pretty soon. I can hear Snookie Lansing singing right now. What in a million? Yeah, who do you agree? It's a probably want to cover. Yeah. Good listen, all sorts of. The blanket. Who's in charge of putting on the promo of the years on? Not your, but I mean, station promos. Like which ones? Yeah, like that. I want about the traffic that goes on for about 45 seconds. I've rated is and unique. But of course. That's our illustrious programming department who could take like I used to say when I first came here. Anything you can say in 20 words we can say in 10,000 here at WIOD. Who? He goes out of 45 seconds. Some of these promos like the one they ran yesterday for Rick and put their ran a minute and 40 seconds. And what is that all about? We're loaded with spots here. We're just jammed up to the gills. It's starting to sound like FTL. But they go on about it. And he's doing it to 20 stations. But they say how great I owe these to. Well, that's because we call it something different. It's still the same in accurate polycrap and they're still never there when you call format. You go with it. Good day. Have a great life. Gary Mills has my check. Well, what I saw him walk down the hall that that way and is looking. Looking for what for trouble. For somebody to sign it. I'll sign it. Don't just cut the crap. Oh, kids almost two o'clock already. Now he's running around worried about somebody signing it with all the executives around to a three hour lunch. Boy, if only Brian could be here to see this. Let's go to Long Island. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Okay. Hey, it's nice and warm up here for a change finally. Yeah, what is it up to 45? Now it's around 60. Wow. Have a duty. The things are better here. Let Laura sign it. Okay. She's kosher. Uh-huh. Yeah, things are better. Here they're cutting back on the railroad. The buses are at home. Yeah. The people are mostly dead up there too. Speaking of the bus they're laying in the back of it. What a great place. You're right about that. It's a toilet, sir. It's the world's largest cesspool. Uh-huh. Get out there before it's too late. Oh, yeah. Okay. Come down here where most of everybody was already dead when they got here. So we can't do any damage to them. Yeah, that's right. Okay. See ya. Okay. You have a nice day. And the same to you, sir. Don't ever call us again. Your is boring is a chocolate milk. 154 at W.I.O.D. Let's go to Miami Shores. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

It's infectious man. Once you're be single at the shower. One and a million. Overwhelmed. And he wasn't single that to his wife. He was single that to Penny Daniel. There's going to be a big announcement at the Miami Arena. 230 regarding the NHL coming to Miami. Yeah. And I'm sure that your sports dudes will be all over it. Well, what's the announcement? Because the thing in a paper this morning looked really depressing. Oh, uh-huh. This is the inside report if you're part in the express. Well, another one of the backers is pulled out. And I hope they're not yet in our chain again on this deal. We're sick and tired of getting led down the Primero's path. Well, you have to turn into a child. How about my maple leaves? How about my maple leaves? One two at a row. I think that's our chance. This is one of the amazing things. Well, that's who we played. Yeah. Okay. Five to three. It wasn't too bad. Have a great day. Thank you. So 230. We're going to get the official news. Boy, I sure hope it's something good. It would be a surprise if it is. Because everything we've been hearing and reading these last couple of weeks has been pretty damn depressing. Right, Rick? Oh, no. I think that's our chance. That's what it is. We're going to get the team. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. Perry, come on. Each of your parts out, man. Man. If that is not the bubbling under on Billboard and within a week, I want to know why. Mobile from Jupiter. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. It's not going to look so boring. What? Chocolate milk isn't boring. It's not that bad. It's not. How about vanilla pudding? I never heard that expression. Well, I'm trying to think of something weird. I've found it. I find it very well as compared it. As compared to regular milk, it's pretty exciting. You're right. Well, some of you was exciting. I don't know. And you'll get my check for a chemo. Probably. Yeah. How do I know if I got your check? I've decided. Mr. Stein. You know, I got to be honest with you. You need very serious health. We're becoming chronic and you make no sense at all. And you want lightning. You need, you need help. You need to butcher up. You need a life value. No, serious. Are you in here that day? I thought, just maybe there was hope for you. But you're not with it. You're out of it. I'm not just money now. Hey, I don't care. We appreciate the money. But that's not an excuse for your aberrant existence. I thought those people leave. They got rid of any old sick and they're still winning. Well, what do you mean they're still winning? Well, they got going to have to team and we're starting to win now. We're putting them in all bad. We beat those tough caps last night. Boy, we're hot. Yeah. Bob Cole starting to grow hair back on his head. It's starting to get dangerous. Well, listen, before you do any more damage to yourself. Have a great life. Okay. So, you're going to hold yourself. 157 at Wild. Oh, boy. This has been just a pressure pack day. Where's my check? Have sub-signed Hillwrights something on there? What is this wandering around the building? I have never seen a place in my life. They got about 40 people who were consigned your check. From the chief engineer to Dumburto, who writes those signs out on a front and spells all the words wrong. Everybody in the building can sign your check. I mean, these sisters boy, they sure are trusting souls. I'll tell you that. Mobile on I 75. How are you, Uncle Neil? Great. Well, I'm on I 75. I'm heading up to Tampa, I'm a sailor. Hold on, pal. Slow down to a crawl. Put it on 30 and put the cruise control on. It's time, would say. Well, I'll tell you what. I was running at about 65. And then I saw a sign. It says 45. So I've slowed down to 45. Yeah. I almost got killed by an 18 wheeler. Yeah. Coming about 72 and a half. They're about. Yeah. Yeah. That makes for a real good traffic flow too out there because nobody knows whether to screamery to bananas. Some people are terminal, they're paranoid. They want to go 45. And others say, this has got to be a mistake. I'm going to go 75. And it really flows things right along. Well, who do we have to thank for all this? The DOT sir, the pigs in the DOT. It's another county plot probably fiddels behind it. I don't know. All right, Uncle Neil. I think we ought to stick fiddell in the middle of I 75. And I'll speed up to about 90. Have a great life, pal. All right. If I get a ticket, I'll send it your way. Okay. All right. See ya. Boy, is there anything left to say? Thank God we're out of time. I think we've just exhausted. Every ounce of energy in our veins today. I see Gary Mills walking his way. Chuck Morris said, hey, I got Neil's check. I'll sign it. He wants to sign it on the back. Mr. Smartass, he lost $14 at the track. The 90's just eased the psychotic about it. Look at the look how he's dressing now. Look at that. Like a slob. Mr. News Director, can't afford to. I had a cellist clothes. I had a rough night in poppin' on the other night. Anyway, a dick and duttle be along with the idiots on the corner. Not just one of them today, but all of you folks. Just go out and stand on any corner and you qualify. A sports talk we got Hurricane Hotline live from Monty's in the Grove with Sunny and Joe. That ought to be really interesting. And then Randy Martin, the art of flirting her second-to-last show on 610 Wiod. Why, O.D., we're pretty excited about it.
