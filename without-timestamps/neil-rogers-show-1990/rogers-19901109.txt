Well, I got a tune to him, Saman. Go truck his and coast coast. I like Maurek, I like the room, but it's not good I love most. There's a gal I left in Fresco, so a young fine name rose, and the best dang fine about her. She lets me wear her clothes, well I proud to be a country transvest child. And I loved the world, the girls closed all day. All day. Lacing bra, a frillin' plouse, a silk in neck, with jays now, I'm still a macho tough guy. And I hope you'll understand. I was born with a big black mustache. It was six pack in my hand. But when I go out for a moment, I do it with a twist. All were strapless, eating and gown, and a nose gay, all my ribs. Yes, I'm proud to be a country transvest child. You're a little bit worse, the girls. And you're a little bit... I close my lips, tease my heart, sleep in lousy way. Now I lost the way I'm living. Don't get me by my clothes. I'm an old American, he made out of love, latched any holes, so don't look at me funny. Or I'll punch out your lines. And the last thing you remember, is a trucker in fish net ties. Just a pad to make, a country transvest child. And I lose to why the girls closed all day. All day. Painted lips, padded hips, my shape legs, all display, yes, I'm proud to be a country transvest child. And I lose why the girls closed all day. Stouling me with some abuse, well it's in us all my way. Yes, I'm proud to be a country transvest child. I get the padded holes on here. I hope I don't get a run. You know, I hate that. I hate that. You know, when you chip your nail, you're not playing like South America's terrible. You're not playing like South America's terrible. You're not playing like South America's terrible. I always think I'm like a country. But it's pretty long, part of the people that don't have to do it, you know what I'm playing? Who? I could use a bubble by it. I really could. And I'm going to go to the shop. I am. I was inspired to play that because I see Randy as playing a thing that I cut your music. Why do they have such fanatical fan? She asks. I'm sure you're very concerned about that. Guess include the program director of Kiss Radio. As in Kiss This, the Nashville Network and interviews with Marie Osmond, Larry Gettlin and Genesee Raleigh and many more. Maybe Randy's going back to Kiss. No, no. Oh, wait a minute. Are you going to let it go? Finally, maybe has returned to the dance floor. Oh, I don't care what my father says. I want you to hold me. But now, she's got a brand new partner. We quiet. We just see I'm trying to use the phone. Yes, it's Jennifer Gray and P. We Herman. Together again for the first time in the world. And, Merdy Dension. And the next episode of Jennifer What? I got my kisses on. Good night. I know. Ouch. Are your steps on my sketch of jerk? I know you're the one. Oh, can we? You've always got to be so obnoxious. A notice. Oh, that's the word of a day. No, or then a movie. It's an excuse to release another soundtrack out of the box. That's the funny. I forgot to rock. Oh, the girl here. He dancing. Now, showing it a playhouse near you. Oh, right. Here is the screen difference. Merle, one of you. Let's see the difference. Merle, one of you. That's a good point. Come. Struffling down the street. They got the used piece of my cousin. Cusley got the old best. Hey, hey, but old monkey. That's you, don't run us alone. They say we smell can't be funky. And here all stood in a crowd. We make money from the youngs. And I care about heavy. But I just let a stay home. Pizza, nice girl, satin. But now, lemon. Hey, hey, we're all monkeys. And here all who's in our hair. This week, heaven's at TV. Next week, on Merle care. I can't go there. I'm so happy. It's the monkey. Day morning, Neil Rogers show. I'm set of four. Okay, that's great. 1118 and W.I.D. Now, you're still there? Yeah. What happened? I don't know. You thought I was West Palmer. Where are you? Boca, you said. Boca, you said. Well, that's close enough. Yeah, what I've happened to stand major? What do we're happy to do? He's alive in Wellington Plantation. And life goes on. Is he working in the station? For Mike Waymer, I got a sign of a little autograph here when you're a big star. When you weigh 450 pounds. No, he's heard that last night. When he's stationed, he'll see Stan and his probably amicov. They're on Brad Boulevard. But he's doing okay. I heard you were mentioned on Larry King. Yeah, you didn't hear the tape? Oh, I was, no, I heard it like around 4 or 60. But will we have it on tape? Do you want to hear it? Yeah. Now, will you hold on? Yes. Then you'd come back and come and I'll put you on hold again. You'll probably use to it by now. Hold on a second. Ashford and Simpson. That's not the right thing. Why have done that twice? That's three mistakes. That's for that old bitch that called before. Have a great life like and a butcher up a little. You're Rogers. Oh, he must be jealous. He's jealous, isn't it? I guess. I know they did it, they said anybody hearing Miami. He's old money by a Larry King throwing your headlight front. I'll play you all. I'll play you all. I'll play you all. I'll play you all. I'll play you all. I'll play you all. Yeah. He knew the whole story. He said. Yeah, he doesn't make a lot of money. And he's been there that market a long time. He really would rather probably in right on this horses. Oh, he's kind of sad. But he's been jealous a long time. I haven't seen him. And what is this 1990? The last time I saw him was in 1997. As long as he was in the past, in 1977. And then he called me the day that he admitted he was a homosexual. On the air he called me to thank me because I had had such a maclific on the air night before he had heard such a maclific. Stim his matlovitch, matlovitch learned since passed on with AIDS. Encourage people who were homosexuals to come out of the closet and meal heard the show. And came out of the closet the next day on his own radio show. And then called me to thank me for having maclific on. That's the last time I've ever seen him or so. I told him to. And then I've heard some people like yourself saying he does this. But I feel very sorry for people who are kind of caught in that local web of jealousy. And I heard he weighed like 400 pounds but I haven't seen him. Last time I saw him I'd say weighed 350. Okay that's it. Now are you a homosexual though? Today. Oh this is Mr. Radio. Oh my god we went to know wondering hung on so long. That's Mr. Radio. 21 after 11 at WOD and we have an open line in Broward 5249463. Maybe pansy would be. I live up to that. We have an open line in Palm Beach 655 here. I can't believe it. Now listen you always call from Daytona. He wasn't caught from a bokeh. He called from Daytona Beach and lied about it. You make a sick Mr. Radio okay. Watch the matter dear. Oh grandpa, make him be such a cold. Oh here honey. Why don't you try some of this nice hot Luther Campbell soup. But grandpa we just had two live stew last night. I know but this is all a different. That's all. It's got the whole album and it's seen a little letter. And you're right. Look there's an F and a U and a T. Get your dry honey. Now it's completely tasteless. Why would anyone eat this? Why? But I'll miss all hungry that's why. Luther Campbell's funky soups. Holy cooked taste so vulgar. You'll be tempted to eat it with a full. No I won't ask you something home. I'll say it. Oh no. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Luther Campbell's the top. Oh, word. Okay. 1126. Wow. We're doing it you know. Let's just put that on an endless loop and go home. Let's try tamarack. Neil. Yes sir. Is it pomp and oh last night making my weekly donation? Yeah. And I ended up with a spire report. I think week is my word at pomp and oh this year. That's W.E.A.K. I've been real weak. I haven't even come close this year. No. I just don't know if this screamer eat a banana. Do you remember hitting the tail raceway? I've never been there but a new ham sure man. Yeah. I've been there many, many of the time. There's a bug boy and bucky day. Bucky day. That's right. That's for dry. Bobby Huntress. Do you remember General Washington? There's a Beckwith. What was his name? What? No. That was. Ted Wing. Alex Winger. Where we go? Do you know how much the audience hates this when we do it? That's why I like to do it. How about Steve Warren? Called. Steve Warren. He's a that whole warrant and family man. They can drive a horse. How about you know what Larry King said? I'd rather be right in the harness horse. That's what Larry said. How about Green Mountain Raceway? In Vermont. Long since closed. Long since scowheagin. What? Scowheagin downs and Maine. Neither have been to Maine. They got those great tracks like Cumberland and Scarborough. Right. They do a 235 mile up there. Yeah. But I have a sparring port for you. Okay. Alan Finkelson. Mike. Fell off of a golf cart. Yeah. While working in Valet parking. Might knock some sense into them. No. It knocked money into his pocket. He's on work as compensation. When was this? I happened last week. I saw him at the track last. You saw him? Yes. Saw. Yeah. And he was complaining about the fact that he can't go back to work in Valet parking. Mike's always complaining because he never hasn't catched a ticket in 20 years. No. He hasn't. I can't find a ankle bird cart. Isn't that enough to really make a frost your ass a little bit? How about? Find how old's third farm does that frost you? Who? Pine. How old's third farm? Don't know it. Martin Finder. Yeah. Harold Dancer Jr. Yeah. Dr. Jay. Dr. Jay. I just thought I'd sneak him in there. Okay. I would like to take this opportunity to call two of my friends. Oscar and Joey. We'll be playing racket for all this afternoon. Yeah. Dooshbex. Okay. And I look forward to seeing you with the track. I'm coming up tonight at the time. I'm playing Alon Barrow State. I'm going to stay away from me. Okay. Go away. Thanks for your money for Camilla Sounds. I just stay away. Don't come anywhere near me. Just to stay up there. You're a little table and shoes with Alan. The assistant made her de up there and leave me alone. Hey. I got a great idea. He's like a kisser that all I got to do is see him. And immediately I just can't pick my nose. Why don't you have a race up there for Camilla Sounds dinner? Well, I'm going to talk to Alan tonight. I think I'll send it. I think I'll send it. You're going to do something for Camilla Sounds dinner. Sure. Well, we'll make donations and go up there and get a night of racing. I got news for her. They could build their whole new building with the I've left it. Poppin' all ready this season. We'll be left it. You bet. What about wheeling down? Good luck. Good luck. Good bye. See you. Another Hialia call. Hello there. Yes, sir. Five hours of sports. All right. Here we go. In other words, you haven't even heard what he's going to do yet. You're already passing judgment, which is right next to passing gas. Is he going to stay on sports top now? I find his own show. He never appears there anymore. Well, I wouldn't say he'd never appear there, but he's not going to be on that show. Okay. He's got his own thing. They got their thing and he's got his thing and he'll be able to train. You're going to make him promise not to talk sports. No, he's going to talk some sports, but he's a well-rounded guy. And if you've seen him lately, you can't even talk about him. Very round. Now, he's a fun guy. He can he'll develop a thing. Oh, and speaking of Steve, you'll never guess who's new best. But let me ask you this question before. And I don't want to try to sway you, but who'd you rather hear from me to 11? Randy Martin or Hank Goldberg? Stan Major. Okay. Okay. Now, what is it about the Steve? His new best buddy in the world. Besides Rick Siderman? Alex Bennett. Yeah. Yeah, they met up there and well, they share this one contempt. You know, anybody who's hostile toward me is Steve's best buddy. That's his whole thing in life. Rick Siderman and Bob Cooldston, Ellis Ruben. That's the only guy that he knows that I like and that likes me as norm can. And that's his new motivation for why he's out to get Rick Riley. Oh, yeah. He's a, you know, I'll be honest. I punched him up at all yesterday. I think for about 30 seconds on the way home. And what was he doing yesterday? Open phone. I don't remember what it was, but whatever it was, it was so terminal. I just punched it out. I told you the novelty wears off very fast, okay? Now, now he's grasping at the fact that Rick Riley stole Alex Bennett's job. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I wasn't honest to a nervous breakdown. Well, he stole somebody's job over there at FTL. He brought in fact he did it in the most devious way of all. He brought in his own sponsors and he blew somebody out. Whoever was doing midday because they moved my Roberts up to ten to two. So somebody got blown out to make room for him. But he's still making 250 dollars a year. Yeah, at least maybe half a million. That's what he said. I said how's it doing working on commission. He said, let's say you make 250 dollars a year. Oh, God. Well, you can't teach an old dog new tricks here. That's true. Have a great life. Brutalot. 1147. 1147. At Wilding, a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello, New York. How are you? Great. I have a couple of fire reports. Okay. I was up on the I 75 and just caught some Steve came yesterday. His big five to six hour. Yeah. I was then he's screaming to me. I guess his producer, whoever he was screaming to me, he said, what are you looking to me that way? You could hear the every other word Steve was saying. Apparently his might court was being disconnected or something. And he was just yelling. You know. Maybe they're tying Steve cords again. Yeah. And he just did all another technical difficulty. It was amazing. Well, good luck to him. I'll need us a real bushly operation. But the guy's got to make a living. He's got a family to support. He's got to go out there and sell those spots. And beg everybody to support his sponsors. And the pleading. And then I was. I don't mind supporting Steve spots. But I don't think Leather Weinstein is what I'm ready for yet. No, not yet. I won't enjoy supporting those. Well, actually any of Steve's sponsors actually. But then I was listening to Rick and Sight and he had a guy talking about pirate and music and Evan called. Who did? Evan. Oh, Evan. I got to apologize to Evan. He was over at the remote. It's specs on Wednesday. And I didn't recognize him. He's got this funky little go-teen-out. He looks so bizarre. Well, he's got a job, Evan. Yeah, he said he even assisted manager at a record store and being in the industry. He knew quite a bit of what they were talking about. I didn't pay for the beer. I'm glad you found that one, Neil. Isn't that great? I feel a lot better now. Well, and I'd like you say I don't think Hank is going to do five hours of sports. No way. I mean, he'll do a hell interspersalize sports just like I do on his show. But it's not a sports show. He has to get always food topics in. And he's big with the women too. So he'll... That's what we hear. Yeah. I think it's only a rumor. I think it's only a rumor. Well, you have a good day. Only is here to rest your nose for sure. Let's true, and before I go, I'd like to call John and Jim and Duce Ben. Okay. Thank you. I don't come any better, Hank Goldberg. Turned about. Round thousand, doubt. Listen. Stand for the door. Hey, hello. What's it, Warren? All fair. You come here often. Pardon me? Have you been here before? No. First time. What's your name? Freeway. Freeway, that's nice. I'm so good. We have to meet you. Take it. I'm here. You were here to get some clean. I don't know. You were working around here. I'm a waiter, but I should have been at her. Yeah, I know. What's the topic? You probably need to rely. Oh, I'll pay. But, you know, with everything it's a news and all, it's a pain. You can start relaxing right now. Freeway. I brought something. Ooh. She. And freeway. Not just any she either. Look. Wow. Goldberg. Hey. Pretty good. You can come here. The most important part, freeway, can be protacked label. Protacked. Aren't those in dorm? By the city council of San Francisco. Absolutely. You know the protacked slogan, don't you? I sure do. Certified safe. By the city. By the bag. Well, what do you say? John. Look at that. I dropped the soap again. Oh, yeah. You. That true life he will. And with confidence. Because freeway and spic can have condoms. Don't let worry spoiled those cans, meetings, and public showers. Always carry. Protacked. The R8EEC. Keep my mind free. SMB. The R-O-C-E-E-T. Bend out with no apology. Try to keep it like a thing. Try to keep it like a thing. I'm so sorry. Don't. John. No, what it's all about. The protacked shoot. So they won't send you. All re-protect condoms. Television of black black house and garden. That's the motivation. Keep these situations safe since 18. He said it. Hollywood. Hey, Neil. What's happening? How are you doing? All right. Look, Dave. Well, I wish you had to burst and had to be on a burst even though it was a little bit late. Well, thanks a lot. Okay, listen. I got something for you to hear. It's only about a minute long. Can you hear? What is it? Give me a little hint. It's called the rubber saw. The rubber saw. Am I going to have to dump it? No, no, this clean. Okay. All right. Hold on. Sometimes. That's that. There we go. Okay. We're ready for it. Yes. You're the one. Okay. It's 11. Wow. I always like those, especially when they're like real far away in that case. I think maybe a little farther would have better. Hello. Yeah. I got a bigger port for you, Neil. Okay. Go on with North Army Beach and Ernie Hickie's a douchebag. All right. Short and sweet. What do we need? If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now. Kick your goddamn teeth in San Francisco. Good morning, Neil. Are you really in the city by the gate of the bay? Yes. I am. Come on. Which town? Okay. I will go and listen to Alex or maybe 20 minutes. Yeah. His guest was Mary Wilson of the Supreme. When he comes back from the news. He was five minutes in his. Uh. Good for around with the lives of your audience and guests who he mentioned. Eric, clambers. You come on here. And you bash me. Yeah. I could. I. I. I'm. I mean, even here he's. Well, Alex likes guys without too much hair. Or talent. I was about the only acceptance he's ever made. So it's going to be nice and warm for a change. Here today. Really? What about 40? Now, let's get up to middle 70s. So is Diane Feinstein coming back to Foothkow now? Is she coming back there with her tail between her thing? I haven't even picked up a newspaper. I know I do. I usually call you sweet water. She came pretty close. I'll tell you. But I have another you don't care. That with bottom and lead. Because that be Wilson. Man, you never saw a free training. Wouldn't steal. What a gun. Hey, listen. It's a screwed up state. What can I tell you? It's great here now. Boy, the sun is shining in the, oh, it's just a heaven. Everybody's wheeled mellow kind of laid back just to snoring. It's still stronger. Yeah. All right. Just wanted to give you comments. Hey, hey, from the left. Well, be sure and call Alex and give him our best. And it's very obvious. You two guys are out of work and you want the afternoon shift. Yeah. So they ought to come here and take your shift here. Well, guess what? What? Next year. Finally. See you. Wow. Call from pamphlet. Let's go. That made my day. Around here. It's the most tasteless thing I've ever heard in my life. And I'm driving to work. I have a show to do. And I'm getting ticked off at you. Call it. If I had the ability to do, I'd take you out here right now. I'm ticked your goddamn teeth in. Why a ability is probably the key word. Yeah. I'll hold me to my cue. I'll tell you what, thank you. You sure left a definite impression. You know, bold on my brain. You're nobody. Just somebody love you. I want to hear about that letter box for me. Yeah. Nobody. There's somebody here. You're my big team. You're my possess. But one. And all is gone. But go once by your hand in that. And you're growing old. The world's still the same. You'll never change. Okay. Here we go. We get to the really good stuff now. There we go. There we go. There we go. There we go. Before we let that finish, can I ask a simple question? What the hell were they thinking about when they put that man on a year here? What in God's name possessed them? To put that slime on the ear? I just, uh... When nobody is somebody. I've been a man who's never met. If I'd just sell somebody. I just don't know. I just don't know. Find yourself somebody. Do not. Go. Thank you. Okay. Happy, uh, whatever it is, Alex. Happy, uh, 40th birthday. Down to 40 now. You know that? A year from Sukus, he's going to be a teenager again. We have an open line in date. 7-5-1. Eric Lambert is God. And one in Palm Beach. 6-5-5-9-463. 6-5-5. W-I-O-D. Temper-pines. Now, for Neil Rogers here's Randy Marshall. I'll use the top video 6-10 W-I-O-D. Yeah. But that's not working. What about Lime King wrong here? Or I have to stop that. And figure it out. Figure it out. Oh, yeah. All overwhelming. All right. We get some cards. Got some numbers. We get some empty line. Wow. Oh, no. 9-1-D-Mont-Neg-N. Oh! Okay. Let's go to... Daniel. Yes, I'm on the audio. Okay. Now listen. I turn on the Steve Cates. Here we go. Do I kiss today? And the first caller gets to it was. No. I heard Gilbert. Ian and Kelvin. Oh, no! Yes, they're sucking up to him saying how great they are. How happy they are that he's back now. I want to tell you something. If I always told you about watch out for the cronics. They're a bunch of phony butt suckers. They fly around like butterfly. I agree. Like a bumblebee. They flip from one perch to another. I hope. Culinating everywhere. Those two are the biggest phonys. They were on with Rick and Suds in the beginning doing their little joint at the Hippurutine on the phone and sucking around with them. And then they came over here and they ruined our Wednesday lunches. And now they're all of a sudden sucking around over there. Yeah. They were their bash Rick and Suds two things. They called them Steve Cates Jr or whatever. Unbelievable. Steve Cates said, yes, they said. He told everybody well who is Western. One person. That you really. I guess you must have been the one. He said that you really don't like Rick and Suds. You just give him positive things. Well, you know, it's really interesting that he makes those things up because I have never haven't spoken to Steve since they came here. I've the only time I've spoken to him right here on the air. I've never said that. It's totally untrue and it's another. If he said that, which all I have is your word, it's another one of his lies. He's just like just like the thing about the Disney telling us we can't put any colors on and mention his name. Steve, why do you make up so much BS? Let's send Steve a big shovel. Okay. He said if if somebody asked you and you were to answer honestly on scale of one to ten, you'd be in a ten. How Rick and Suds are doing and you were to be totally honest. You would say no more than a one. Oh yeah. That's why they got a four seven in the last book. What was Steve's last number here? A three five with some very embarrassing demographics? I know Steve K's listening. He's totally flooring and that would be the last time I ever listened to that. Now you'll turn it on again. No, I swear I won't. Rick and Suds are great. I agree with that. Okay. Okay. But just keep making it up, Steve. Just keep desperately flailing around trying to cause that big controversy because it just ain't happening. I mean, like I said, I wish him all a luck in the world and his success or lack of it is going to have nothing to do with Rick and Suds or this station. I mean, the only thing this station has got to do with it is we've given a more promotion than over there, which is nothing because they haven't got two nickels to rub together at FTO. But that's about it. So we certainly can't blame us for what we've given him a big send-off. But, geez, you got to make your own thing. You got to do your own thing. You can't try to siphon off from the rest of the world forever. You have to stand in your own two feet. Be a man. Like Marlon Brando said, and we still want to know what the hell he knows about it. United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression. Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait. Just the way it's going to be. We like to think of the who say, and he's here with the fight. Sit back and watch his head and sleep like the middle of way to ride. He's right to steal away Kuwait. And be the one you see, or you see. To be safe, and go away this key. We should be on the fight. To be the one you see. We can't play our food. Let it end. Let it end. Go away. Let it end. Turn your feet. Touch up and make it hear the mercy. Touching. He's going to pay. Son of a say. Go to the flower in the way. Son of a say. Double play ball on. Out of the ordinary. The smell is on. The smell is great. And the cups get out of the top of the egg. And still eat. Four. But three. Okay, that was the Mexican I just mentioned at OK. Here we come down. Music. New stock radio 610 WIOD presents the New Roger show. To get in touch and talk with Neil. And then we can go. They say you're young and you don't know anything but making big old dough. Oh, I don't know if that's quite true. I know enough to much I'll allow you. Wrong. Yes, sure. I got you wrong. And I got your gold card, sure. I got you wrong. I know you can't afford the rent on what you make. We'd be stuck in a tent. Yeah, that's true, but this feels right. And can't you see I'm just a parasite. So let them say it's just a win. We know it's deep. We both go to the gym. Yeah, I got you to pay my bills. I got you for your baby's skills. I got you to break into showbiz. I got you to play with my kids. I got you because you got money. I got you because you're taller than sunny. I got you baby. Right in payment of beer. Herman and McBean, one WGTR. Miami, five-odd, and the pound beaches. South Florida is only true. Rock and roll morning show. Part of a cooler than hell, summer. The team was rock and roll, 97 GTR. She's gone. We lost her, the struggling lady has gone. We've been wild all day. We can't get her on a year. Come on, honey. Just one time. Same old, belching in the same old fetching. Come on. Give us a break already. Hold on for a second. Okay. Let's start and brown this ought to be great. Hello. Yeah. Yes. Well, I got a button for Larry. Oh, why? I got a button for Larry. When your memory goes, you can forget it. Great. Listen, I do have one evening in a showboat. And turn at the bank out, tell him, Miami Beach. But it was just a slipper. That's when he went in the bank for a break later. Yeah. Instead of playing the horses, he rode up. Mm-hmm. Well, I haven't tell you that with a good idea. Wish you was down there to put my lights on yesterday. I remember to do with that. I don't know. But it was a good idea. Yeah. Well, we're going to do it. Yeah. Have a great life. Wow. 109. At WIOD. What is all that stuff? Do we have any mail, by the way? Plantation. Hi, Neil. Hi. Who is my anniversary of the day? So I called Rick and said so. And they said, I was trying to decide between the melting pot and the armadillo cafe. Yeah. Rick said go to the melting pot. I think it's because he lives in call spring. Mm-hmm. And such as go to armadillo. And I heard armadillo on your show. So we decided to go to armadillo. And it was out standing. It's outrageous. Oh, it's great. It's orgasmic. It was a good night. Well, you have. I have the seafood deablo. Mm-hmm. And it was out standing. And we had the black and white soup. And we had. My husband had the yellow-tailed snapper. Mm-hmm. Oh. It's terrible to go there. You have one of those ears? I didn't hear it. Did you have the dessert? No. I didn't have any room for you to have that mocha crème brûlée. Oh, man. Now, I couldn't. I couldn't force another thing. And we had the, the nachos beforehand and the soup. And then we had the appetizers. And that was funny. I think it gave you lots of food. Yeah. Yeah. So no way. I couldn't eat all that. I want to go back and try something dessert. Well, try that. When you try dessert, try that mocha crème brûlée. It's got like a real thick crust on it. In fact, next week, Marvin's going to go out and put some of that crust from the mocha crème brûlée and somebody's pants. But it's tremendous. But don't tell Rick. I won't. I won't. Because I just want him to know that such had the better suggestion. Some other things. What are both great? Yeah, but I live because of being in plantation armadillo with closer. And I was not disappointed at all. From the outside, you'd never in a million years or whatever. No, you would never know was anything there. It's just like that kind of Yahoo, Davey. I think like I need to go get some muffler parts. Right. Right. While you're a pull-up, you're horse up to the Hitchin post. That's right. This side. I heard Randy mentioned last night that she didn't get a memo about how much was collected. She's got a question for a criminal. She actually said on the air how much you'd collected. Great. Well, good for her. Yeah, she's getting her peasing keys down. Well, we're working. I'm just too busy. I'm just too busy. I'm just too busy. I'm just too busy. I'm just too busy. Well, we're working extra hard on it because she'll probably be over there pretty soon. So we're doing our best. Oh, and the old will be fun to have, Hank. Yeah. But I like to do the really article about Rick and the Hill. I've just been pausing. Yes. I've just been picking little spots. And realize when a nice guy he was. Who said that? The Harold. He talked about it. I mean he has some personal things. I don't know. I know. I mean, I don't let it fool you. But I do agree that he has gotten a little bit less of a homer. Listening to him on the radio can be. Well, he said. It's said he's going to let him his compass. Which direction should he go? Exactly. Where's that ball? Have a great weekend. Okay. One, four, two, three, two, three. Ten. Ten. Rock and roll. Classes in a row. Twenty seven GTR. You don't play the men in sisters. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, man. There's some heavy duty stuff in there. And here's one that doesn't even have a label on it. It's probably blank. You're ready with your finger on that button. Fort Loddale Florida. Hello. Hello Larry. First time caller. Hi. Listening on WIOD610. I mean, my old station. Yeah. Your old station. Two things. I want to get your comments on Neil Rogers, both professionally and personally. Well, I got to tell you this. This is people will never believe this. This cart hasn't even got a label on it. I had no idea what it was. It's in the bottom of the thing that we're all as GTR stuff. And there it is. It's almost like an oldman. And also, how would you go about getting into talk radio? And I'll hang up a little bit. Someone called earlier. I haven't heard Neil in years. I have no idea. I remember the time when I remember the time when he came on the ear and came out of the closet. Yeah. And I left Miami shortly after that. I've not heard him since. He does a kind of shock value. It's not my kind of spit. I'm told he does a shock value. You know, what can I say next to shock you? And that's not my kind of speed. As a worker, well, I haven't heard him in 13 years. Nashville. Hello. Ha ha ha. Wow. Boy, thank God we saved that. One 19 on a very Larry King intensive Friday. It means I must probably win $50 tonight, right? It's what it sounds like. Unlabeled old GTR cards. And finally, Michael, I know it's a holiday. And President Bush is vacationing in Kenny Bunkport main and join the day off from the White House. But hey, I still wouldn't give him a call. I'd say happy fourth July. After all, it is the nation's birthday. Okay. Well, now, Jerry's still out. Sure. Spray cans may be bad for the ozone, but you're going to take away bars, can't it? The O5. Well, she'll look just like Edgar Winter. Oh, wow. We got some wild stuff. A little channel 7 card there. It's incredible. And speaking of wild stuff. Hey, Neil, I done. You'll never guess who's on the phone now. It's pretty heavy duty. Pretty heavy duty. I'm not just gone. I'm a little pissed off. Right. First of all, you're shouting. Okay. We can hear you. I know you're emotional and you're trying to flex your muscles. I'll do it to me. I know how it is, but just relax. Take a deep breath. We got lots of time. Okay. Okay. Let's just amelize the entire situation out. Find it exactly if you guys are as disloyal. And I just like to say one thing is so. I didn't call Ian called by himself alone. You're not there. Didn't know about him. Let him know by himself alone. What? Wait a minute. Hold on a second. What line is on it? Quick. She's gone. Oh, she's gone. That was the old bag. She hung up. Hello? Yeah. Go ahead, I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, like I said, I did not call him. I never called Ian called. Yeah. So that's not all I'd say. I'm just going to call him. Yeah. But once you on with me with Ian a couple of weeks ago, when the news broke that Mr. King was coming back on a year. Yeah. I was in the steam before. And you were saying, oh, boy, we are so ecstatic and boys are going to be great. Those guys are okay. But we're all going to. And we're going to the same guys that came on with them in the beginning when they first came on in the afternoon and sucking around and calling together. I mean, I don't understand what kind of loyalty you guys have got. Well, I don't want to be here. No, it's not. It's easy. You know, this is incredible. This is even such a state of the with his mouth that was to the thing down there. And the other, we can't believe you. Oh. How can you call guys on the year and go on about how great they are and become a little superstar? You're like a radio butterfly. You're like a butterfly. Aren't you embarrassed? I don't know. I've nothing to say. No, no. That's not an answer. Well, no. Calvin, but I have a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit. What is it? Why, I was in a steam. You came before I can start. Come on. Yeah. And then I was in a can start. But I always been listening to you. No, no. Don't say. Oh, you sound like Steve. You're sucking around me. You're not going to work. That doesn't play with me. But we're not discussing me. We know this shows great. Okay. Bottom line is 2 to 6 in the afternoon. You've got your choice. You can let's have some fun with Rick and Sauds. Are you going to come or you can listen to a man making a living on the year. Self-provoting with 85 minute breaks and traffic and the try to figure out how to get out of that little room. And if you want that's fine. But I don't understand why one day, these guys are great. You're having a great time. And the next day, you're like sucking around. Is that what you want to be known for all your life? Is sucking around? I don't understand. Come on. Okay. Stand up for yourself. Don't be such a whip just because he has got you, you know, a submissive kind of an attitude. Why do I do like Steve Kane? I mean, that's the same now. What do you like about him? He's fun to listen to. Fun? Yeah. How about that show Tuesday the full hour funeral for Michael Hanne on air Did you listen to that show? I didn't listen to that one. Why not? Because it's Tuesday. Do you did an omission on your way? Oh. Would you have listened to it? I'm sorry. Oh, not really. Oh. Why not? Because I'm probably wouldn't mind. Oh. And what's going on? I've seen you're great. Like no, I'm not going to be the end of the world. I'm going to have a conversation with you. I'm not trying to sell one way or the other because to each its own. If whatever makes you happy. What about when Ellis Ruben is going to be on? Is that going to be fun? Of course, honestly. What about when Rick Sighterman is it? Well, you've heard all those guests a minute at times if your Steve Kane Listener, have a juice? Yeah, but I don't even remember what they had to say. Oh, the little little relapse. So what I'm saying absence makes the parts grow fonder. Yeah, you might be right. But they don't have a lot of commercials. I will say that. Yeah, it's bad. Great. Well, why do you mean, when we just take a have a telephoto collection and take up the money and then maybe you can do a show? Yeah, I'm not going to do it. But there it is. You're Waffling Kelvin. I know. Well, I'm exhausted. You should be flustered. Rick Rally is wounded. He's hurt. He's a sensitive emotional basket case already. And you guys are like butterflies. One day they're great. Now Steve's great. And if like some real famous person like John McHugh comes on, he afternoon on QA, you'll be calling him. Say you're great. Watch out. Watch out. Watch out. Won't you? No. Definitely not. I think the least you can do like Monday is the holidays. Come over here and take your clothes off and the students. The least you can do to make up for it. Okay. Okay. See you. Alright, back. Let's try Fort Lauderdale. Hey Neil, how you doing? Okay. I heard a room where I want to know if it's true. Yeah. I heard you were a bag, is that true? What? A bag it? Pansy. Oh, Ian is on the phone. How you doing, Neil? Oh boy, you guys are just not a control. You need to get like a life transplant you too. I want to tell you Rick Rally and Suds Coleman like to come to your house and beat the crap out of you with a two by four. Coving needs to put you up a little bit. Yeah. Well, that was a wimpie call. I mean, why did you at least admit that you guys are butterflies and your insincere and you're like suck around everybody? Oh, that's not true. Mostly each other. Markets up 30 points. I would never fly away from you, Neil. See you're doing the same thing. He was doing. I'm not impressed by that. That's the oldest chronic talk radio tactic in the world of suck around with the host. I see through that. You're not talking to Alex Bennett now. But it's true. I never spoke to Alex Bennett. Yeah, right. But if you would have you. Oh, Alex here. The greatest. Can we come down to be in your live studio audience? Can we come down and suck around each of your food and ruin your show? Of course, he didn't need any help. No. Okay. Well, he won't believe he. But I don't believe you already because when you preface the statement by saying you won't believe me, it's pretty obvious that you're full of it. Well, because you don't believe me, so I trusted it. Well, what's the, what's the pholonial statement? You've seen that, you know, I mean, we listen to you and Steve Kain originally. That's how we need Steve Kain before. What does that have to do with Rick and Puss? No, it's really not to do with it. I mean, I don't have nothing against him. I don't really care about him either. But the point is see you both are missing the point. If you were just like kind of like casual colors and you were part of the vast audience out there, the passing parade, that would be one thing. Okay. But I have a good memory. Okay. And I remember back in the beginning when these guys first came on a station, the two of you always entanned them like joined at the thing. We're always on a phone just heaving. You're an aiding all over them and just carrying on and all. I mean, you were just, it was just phenomenal. It was mind boggling. And then all of a sudden the first day, Mr. Contrary, Diego comes back on here. Oh boy, we're there. Okay. But boy, he's really, and then I ask your paler, what's so great. What do you enjoy? Did you hear this? Oh, no, well, I can't listen on that day. And oh, no, if I heard this, it would probably be boring. Say, on your doing is you just, I don't know what you're doing. What are you doing? I don't know. What do you want to be trouble makers? I don't want to be trouble makers. I'm trying to get Rick Rally's blood pressure up in cousin to have some kind of a cardiovascular accident, sir. We've got a nice car though. Play some good music today, Johnny. What is it? We've got a nice car to go home, you know. Rick. I'm not kicking out here, but it's time to go on the air. Johnny, doork. There we go. It's over to the coast. Right. He took a big, you know, breath a big, a thing of helium before or went over there. Okay. It's 82 along the coast. I can hear right now. He's going to be great today. I don't know. I don't know. Don't try to change the subject. We still have about a minute to go here. I want you to try to explain to these poor guys why you are a turncoat. I mean, no reason. You're like the Angus Allen of radio or was it Ethan Allen? Or Ethan whatever his name was? No. I'm not like, I mean, anything like a Gilbert. I'm not even close. I was in the youth. You're a turncoat. I was in the youth. Rick and such. And Steve Kinnow on TV. I've never listened on AM radio. Yeah. I'm still not responding to our question. Well, I mean, what I turned on him. Did that was the question was? Yeah. No reason. I still was listening to the N.T.S.D.K.K. Back. Yeah. Well, that's really it. Did you like the Maracana show? No, that was that day. I didn't listen. Are you going to listen when I listen to Rubin is on? Actually, I think I was Rubin's kind of a... You like Rick's side, I mean? I don't even know who that is. Oh. I mean, I know you. How about Reverend, Reverend Unic Polis? I actually like I told him yesterday. And you weren't late, he into that? That's kind of... Because I know the British are into that T in the afternoon. Well, I don't know. Yeah. I think you guys ought to kind of like spend a real club. Maybe go up to a new Hampshire or something for the weekend together. Wait, wait. Kind of cozy up in front of a warm fire and discuss this under less pressure when you're away from all the immediate pressures of this radio market. And kind of get your thing together. You know, I can genuinely, I might be going out to University of Maryland. Oh, promise? I'm going to be depressed there. How about I go listen to you every day? Well, you can pick up FtL up there, I'm sure. Have a great weekend, Ian. You too, Ian. You're full of it, okay. You're fine, but... Wow. A couple of radio phonies there. They're not full on any of you folks. You're a lot too sharp for that, right?
