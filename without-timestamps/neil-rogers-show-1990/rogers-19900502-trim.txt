Okay 25 after 10. I don't know what that card is. Who's is that? Says random sounds? Maybe that's theirs. Who could let's start playing their material? Anyway, look at those Broward lines. Five, two, four. Wild, D, and Broward. And the Palm Beach is also open. 65, five, two, three. Oh, you gave out the number. Yes, I will. I learned my lesson yesterday. Anyway, the Cubs because it was a late game last night. Kicked it. There were behind four to one against a giant early and then they came back and Dunston had a home run to put him ahead and they beat the giant seven to four. And the Balakki one is first game. Don't he got a win? Dunston had another home or the Sandberg had a home run. And the Met's by the way are now tied with a Cubs in last place. But the two teams are going in different directions. The Met's, the Cubs are now hitting and still getting good pitching and the Met's are incredible. Hojo threw another one away last night. And Derek Lilliquist the Braves pitcher hit two home runs off Ron Darling, not one but two. And the Met's took the pipe against. Not did that idiot get fine for holding the ball while two runs scored? I don't know. I mean, there's a big big things in a paper. I don't know if he's going to get fine. Don't have all the Broward lines. Look at that. If you've done this or is it me? Five, two, four. Are they working? They're working. What is that? What is that sound? Wait a minute. Yeah, I guess they're working. It's a strange sound. Okay, here's a breathless lady on the date county. Hello. Hi, I'd like to speak to Uncle Neil. Yes. Hi, I'm Dee.

So if you enjoy in her harbor, you should enjoy a base side except that it is predominantly Spanish. I'm participating in so many sports. I'm trying to get my picture on a weighty spot. I would have sports. Good. So my dad would tell me not to go to Hollandell Beach because you can't find any. Well, there's nobody out to the edge of a hundred over there. Is that right? Yeah. That's what I do. Do you do? Are you under a hundred? Yeah. Why did you come here? Did you you like it lost? No, I went through a bad divorce. So I thought I'd come down here. Oh, and really get depressed. Well, don't listen to the show because I'm depressing and I have a negative crappy attitude and I'm just not positive. You know, like people who work for a week.

And they're going to say dad, what is this about? Well, say goodbye. Say goodbye. All right. Okay. Oh, is that pouring? 1033 at Wild. We have an open line of date. 751 stand. And some time in the morning. Who's the one to discuss? Seven eight Wild. You don't pay any attention to him. What? We have to discuss Madonna's appearance on our setting. I just threw it in the waistband. I can ride your left. I don't care. Madonna is a uh, in fact, that song we played shower in the beginning. That's because you have to know what they call a police. Yeah, she's the police. He's the police. I can know how you don't like him. But you got to hear what they were talking about. Was it so bad? Yes. Well, of course. Absolutely. The filthyest interview I've ever seen on television. Really? Yep. Why we should be in a tape of it. Okay. It's 1033 at Wild. If you're fat, if you're just the fat is just bulging off your disgusting road test. Uh, 1037. That's got to be their card, isn't it? At Wild now, you were going to talk about their singular card. Madonna. Come on. Don't start ripping them. Even though you hate them like poison. Uh, Madonna and our senior. But first, uh, on a fast machine, I don't know what paper this is out of. But there's a letter, a hysterical hospital letter from a lady from St. Martin and the Netherlands and Tilly's about how she came to visit. Boca, how the how she chose Boca, I have no idea about the people uh, sucked and um, people would such close minds and mistrusting inside. See, it's just me. I'm just a bad guy. I mean, here's a lady came here for the first time. She's 34 years old, not a little prune. She's traveled all over the world. And she says, oh, she wasn't visiting. She lived there. She says nothing prepared me for the two years. I spend in Boca, Raton and we have a colore in Boca right now with smoke information. Hello, how you doing? I'm going to blow some smoke into your radio. And I read that letter this morning. What what paper was that? It was in the Boca news. Well, she's got it down to a tee, doesn't she? Yeah. You know what she's talking about? Well, at least now she's far away. Yeah. And wherever she lives, well, uh, stands there, right? Yeah, last I looked. Okay. Well, um, the, the, question, the smoke shop will be closing down in about 90 days. Mm-hmm. Everything's uh, like on 75% off sale except for the cigars and all. All right. I got to tell you have something very fascinating about this because when when Neil was smoking a couple of years ago, he was a couple of years. So you mean cigars? Yeah. He used to go into the winter box at the Broward Mall occasionally. It disappeared. Now the tender box at Boca Town Center is going to disappear. Guess what? They're both most malls are co-managed. Or isn't that interesting? Oh, and the big thing, did you see it a paper the other day about Boca Town Center? That's right. Right. He's using out a lot of the merchants. That's right. There's something like 20 or 25 or so that'll be leaving. They said they uh, they just don't fit the image. Yeah. What do you mean? They want their little ape. You're there. They want smokers in there. Maybe they don't want smokers money in those stores. They're either, huh? So if you smoke, maybe you should stay away from those joints. Who knows? That's all. cigar by the way. Really? Okay. Thanks a lot. Right. That's okay. Ooh, 21 to 11 at WIO. If you haven't been smoking them lately, you smoke. I do smoke it, but it doesn't bother me, but it's just the rank. I don't know how you smoke those men. Those are gut renters. They're like elephants repositories. Rose. Oh, are you in a barrel rose? No, I'm in a bad phone and I'm at home with Leah. We're both sick. Well, don't start with Leah again. Rose is to be the shortest call in the history and I like you a lot and Ricky. Although I don't hear from him anymore. All those pinheads, man. I'm history. Now, you know, old dead meat. It's exactly like I can say that. It's exactly what you said before. He's busy with his other thing. Oh, is that it? Uh-huh. Well, you can only do it so many times a day. Leah, Rose, whatever your name is. You would think so. Yeah. I'm calling because I am home sick. Maybe he's got a spare. With Leah and you have stand on and I'm going to. I say, boy, you wouldn't get upset because I know I've been calling. Well, your call yesterday was useless. I mean, you can try to put that little, the torpe on the ear and she's got nothing to say. Well, sometimes he doesn't sometimes. People are put their little kids on ear like Erin. You know, Erin was okay for about two seconds and I was that I noticed he hasn't been calling and his father hasn't been calling. They didn't send me a card. They didn't wish me well. Well, it's just that she was listening and she said she would talk and then she didn't. You know, how that goes. Yeah. But, you know, you have stand on and I wanted to say hi. Hi, Rose. Hi. I wanted to play a tape of Don Johnson when he called you, but I don't have my tape player. Good. That makes Neil's day. That really makes Neil's day. Whatever happened to Don. Great personality and nice guy. Right. Wonderful. My buddy. I thought. Blind bed. I don't know. He and Madonna should have gotten married. They would have been a match made in heaven. And before you go, can you do one short thing for me? What that is? Just say freeze major. My anti-vice you're under arrest. Absolutely. I'm not going to do that. Sorry, Stan. The face star play in that card that I'm going to get upset. I didn't play anything they want. I told him that yesterday, but don't play that card. I can't help it. It was a great day. Everybody was, you know, like, on edge anticipating Don the call because you have what's his face in there? Michael Talbot. Yeah. Whatever happened to him. I don't know. He hasn't worked a day since he left Miami. Is that right? I don't think so. Okay. You have a daughter. Don't you stand? Uh, stepdaughter. Okay. Yeah. That's a little baby boy. Oh, that's great. Yeah, he is great. How can we don't ask about my dogs rose? Well, what I want to ask you now is the wife and how's the kid. He allows the backyard stand. Oh, he has a wonderful family man. But put out that still he little kid. I want to ask you about that. What are you talking smoking cigarettes and cigarettes? You don't inhale cigars. I don't get into your lungs and cause all that mungent collagulate and accumulate. It doesn't get in there. Exactly. Oh, I like a lot of other things. I see. Well, how are your dogs? My dogs are wonderful. Well, good. I have to. My big dog thinks he's an elephant. He looks like you know, I don't mean that when he squats down. He thinks he's an L. Oh, God, you've never seen anything like that. Does it show in the backyard? Yes. My backyard is a mine field. Yeah. You have to put on your hip boots. It's almost like you're listening to the Ranieri show. You have to put on your knee boots. Don't be a joke. Mike, don't get sensitive. Now, let's start picking on him. Okay? You're cool. How come I've been here a long time. We never pick on him. Nobody ever picks on him. Wow, that's because he minds his own business and he's smart enough to stay out everybody's way. He's doing his own thing. Exactly. What is it? Look like crap. How does your pull my what? Well, the guy I'm not talking about forget it. We're not getting in any of that anymore. Okay. We don't know. We do not discuss any of that kind of business on a year. Oh, I'm sorry. No, it don't have to be sorry, but I just know better. Everything is under control. Everything's going great. I don't want to prompt anymore. Hey, Sarah. I don't want to start any more crap either. You know, you said, you know, we have enough friends. You say if the shoe fits where it and I understand that, but you haven't kind of cut it in. She's saying she was going to toss you to do it. Well, two light, two light honey, you missed your big chance yesterday. Okay. Oh, it's like Bill Marshall. He was going to say something once too. And that was it. And look who he stuck with now. What little thing? This is because you say one little thing. Yeah, like goodbye. You want to say goodbye? No, she's just no. Okay. Oh, well, tell her up hers. Oh, well, tell her to call that other guys 11 year old son and you have a great conversation exchange phone numbers. Okay. Have a great day, Rose. Bye. Oh, she sounded a little depressed. It's too bad. I can't handle those little kids at the make gutterable sounds. 1044. We have one open line in day one in Bokeh. We're going to really pop these calls because stands coming today in the audience's psychotic. What, you know, you keep saying what the hell do you want? And that should be on all the billboards. It should be wherever they are. I haven't seen one yet. And from what I understand, I see a runarius on, uh, then by body five. Is it good? No. Oh, that's terrible. But they should say what the hell do you want? WOD, you just have pictures, you know, the various douchebags because God they don't know. You people really don't have any idea what you want. They brought you caviar and filet mignon on a plate. You'd say, wow, where's the asparagus? That's just, it's true. It's just amazing. Miami. If you know how to press, I am. Hello. Go on. Well, up yours too. Okay. And liais. Two open lines in date, 751 WOD, one in Bokad, 278 WOD. Oh, yeah. Hey, they's combination of rows and stand major. I turned on a combination of what? That the rows that brought that he's all every day. Yeah. Oh, definitely sucks to take. Well, let me ask you a question. Speak out of sucking the big one like this call. Let me ask you a question. Yeah. He didn't enjoy what you're listening to. Why did you change your dial? Why do you think I have? Well, that's great. No, I don't want to listen, but why do you feel compelled to tell us? Well, if I'm watching or listening to something, I don't find the interest. Oh, I don't like it. What I do? I switch the channel because it's annoying. That's why. But you don't have to listen to it. It's just for somebody got to have you would take a hostage or somebody got a gun to your dead head. Somebody got a gun to your head. Somebody forcing you to listen to what? What? Do I ever hear what? Let us to the evidence there where somebody doesn't agree with something. So what about it? So send a letter. Okay. 1046 at WOD. Boynton B. Chillow. I had a vision last night that she was on a bulk align by the way. Oh, the G-char is going to get rid of those two guys in the morning and you're going to take over the morning show on G-K-R. No thanks. We got enough problems finding an audience here. We don't need to go over there. All right. At least we're still in the plus column. I think that then you completely turn around that after I mark it in. Yeah. I mean the morning show is just so terminal right now. It's unbelievable. Yeah. Well, good luck to you, sir. All right. See ya. I think others think about that last. About what? About how come if Cox broadcasting with it is so smart they were. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who ever said that? No, I was thinking about this. If Cox broadcasting. If Cox is in charge, if I was in charge. I'd have you doing the morning show. If you were in charge, even with a show at night. You're on like once every two weeks and now you're in charge. No, I do. I'd have you doing the morning show on G-K-R so fast. They would know well, they're going to like that. They already hate me like poison, Herman and McQueen. So they're going to really love, oh no, he's out for our show. You know, well, I am okay. I wasn't on bail. They're failing. Oh, wait a minute. We're in here. It was just right. And they're not too keen on that either. He don't like that. What for you to be again? No, he isn't going to be happy about that. He did fine when you were on Seda. I beat him once. He did fine. No, he you're ready. He did well. Nothing affects Reneri. He doesn't make any difference. He's like in trend. They're there. Most of more to add with it changed the dial. It's just a little joke. Don't get the sensitive now. Now, he doesn't care. Nothing faces him. He's like he just comes in. He's oblivious. I think his brains are like pickled. Anyway, it's 1047 at WIOD. Can we talk to you about 20? Oh, yeah. 1051 at WIOD. So what about that, Mike? I go over to GTR in a morning. Would that be okay? He don't care. He hasn't care about anything. As long as the check comes every week, he don't give a damn about anything. I don't plan it. Oh, I'm beach. I heard Alan Finkelson is going to be doing the morning show on GTR. Is that true? Alan and Michael Finkelson is called the gambling and gambling for desperation. How about you, me the Greek? Is it true you're going to teach you, Carr? It's not important that your friends win it to track. It's important that you give them a stroke. Just a joke, Alan. Don't take it personally, but stay away from me. Is it true that I'm one? Are you going to teach you after the morning show? Yeah, I'm going to watch him. There'll be part of their live studio audience. See if they're really assurly on here as they treat me off the year. They're like nasty guys. They're really are everybody thinks they're a lot of fun. They're not fun. They're no fun. They're not fun. Let's start ripping them now. Okay? I'm going to be working putty look. Is there desperately searching for an act? Rip them. Okay. See you. See that's what our audience wants. They're into that. So don't call up a day. You're depressing. And I'm not. You love it. You're massacist. I fit right into the market. What I came here I was, you know, mellow. You are the market. That's right. I am the market. Okay. People are on the air. No one else needs to be on the air. dummy. Okay. I mean, it's out Florida. It's it's moved. Oh, don't rock sucking around. I can't catch any more hours. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. This is Kathy. I'm the nurse who called a couple of weeks. Hi, Kathy. How are you doing? Thank you for the call. Kathy, you picked him in the push. Yeah. It's really funny that everybody keeps saying that I don't want to take away any credit because you were very observant. But the fact that I went to the hospital had nothing to do with your call. I don't want you to feel bad. I mean, I think you know that. No, I think you know that. But it's like everybody says, boy, thank goodness that nurse called you and warned you. And you're, you know, it was a nice call. But then had nothing to do with it. That's my meal. I know that because I was stupid. There was something wrong. Oh, yeah. And I was stupid. And I thought, well, I'll go home and lay down for a while off field. But I didn't. And then I said, well, there is something wrong. And I'm going. I'm just, I was very concerned. And I felt I had a lot of work. Well, I'm doing real well. And of course, there's some people in the, that's another thing that took me off when I was listening yesterday. Here I had a stroke less than a month ago. Okay. And I'm not looking for sympathy. But the point is a stroke is not like having a migraine headache. As you know, it's a serious blow to your system and your body. You have no energy and it takes a long time to get back to where you were. And these people think like, well, I should hear, and I'm going to go through hell on a year and in the building and people are going nuts. And I'm just going to be oblivious. I can't do it. I'm not Superman. I'm a human being. And a lot of these people all they know is a radio show. Well, life is more than just a radio show. Right. It helps most important. Man, you bet. And I'm not going to kill myself for a bunch of slime balls out there who think, you know, I'm supposed to be here to keep them in a good mood all day. Well, you made a remarkable recovery. So great. Yeah. Well, I'm doing real good today. I feel a little flush. You know, I don't know what that is. That flush feeling in the face. Maybe the tidy bull man knows. But that's because of the cups one last. Yeah. That must be it. Oh, it sounds like you're taking care of yourself and changing your lifestyle a little bit. I'm trying. I'm not eating anything that is not my diet and I'm sticking. You know, the only other thing, I'm going to get on my exercise bike today. I was a real another stupid thing. I did. I kept trying to do two three minutes at a time on it. And I would be like, ready to pass out. And then my friend Dave was over yesterday and he, he looked at the thing. He said, you got this thing tightened as tight as it'll go. I wasn't even thinking about that. You know, every exercise bike is going to lose your or tighter thing. You know, and so we loosened it up. And now it's a snap. You know, so I guess even Hercules couldn't have done three minutes on it by. Well, I'm glad you're doing better. And you know, yeah, I'm doing really good. Well, come back. Thanks a lot, Kathy. Okay. You take care. Bye. 10 54 W. I. O. D. Oh, now see we're getting close to the news. Here's that syndrome. Oh, yeah, we have three open lines. This is another part of the new routine. I mentioned this about on a four five months ago. They started it. And did you know that it? Well, it just shows you that we're not as important in their lives as we used to be used to be. They would hang on forever. You remember those days. I'm sure you do it wins when we really when we had audience. And we'd come in and like two minutes before my show, the news was on. So nobody in the studio, two minutes till 10 all the lines would start flashing. You didn't have to even be on the air much less give the numbers out. And then you'd come on it too. And it would start again like right after the news. Oh, they all hang it on. It died. It too. No, all right. It died because I suck. Oh, seriously. I'm telling you, and that lasted for I don't know. Two, three months something like that. But those were the days boy. I mean, those people would have held on for three hours because they just were into it. Now it's like people start taking stuff for granted. And one day you wake up and somebody's gone, you know, I will say this afternoon, draw no more studio audience. And you know, you start taking people for granted afternoon, try more new rods in here running around shaking their boobs. You know, that's what happens when you take things for granted. You mean, a Rick and a Suds hard into that? I don't know what they're into. They just, I don't know. There why is ought to be suspicious? Those two spend a lot of time together. They're doing it. Do you want to join to the hip? Now what were you going to say just that the phone syndrome and after that, starting especially about 334 or 430 years. Well, I have to drive your tunnel. I would never do after you're driving. I wouldn't do it for all of them. I would have to be a lot more money. I'll tell you that. Because I don't like it. I hate it. And when you get into that period of time, you're trying, they're going to have to get used to that 430 to 6-boy. People don't have a lot of time to hang on. No. That was the thing that caused it to raise me at Zeta is that people would hold on in the morning. Yeah. But of course, most of our people were like dead feeds, but you didn't do, you didn't have traffic and news and eruptions. You didn't have sports stuff and now that's true. You basically did your thing without an eruption. You have lots of eruptions on the road on the road. The only way is when Bolger would come in and get all better shape. Did you hear that he called me the other day? Yeah, you're talking. Yeah. It's nice guy. He was not I have seen this many times. If he wasn't in the business or if he had never worked for Gogganet broadcasting, he'd be a great guy. His wife is a really nice person. And I really, it's fun of all things I say. I like him. He's a nice guy. But the business has turned him into another like, you know, wacko, mobile. Hello. Hi, how are you doing? I am a first time caller. Ray, yes. Oh hi Neil. How are you doing? Fan started to talk about Madonna. Yeah, oh that's right. Yeah, and he didn't finish. Okay. Why are you Madonna fan? No, but I wanted to hear about what happened. And then you see the interview last night? No, I miss it. Oh. Oh. Oh, God. Yeah. Okay, everybody at Capcom Rockwell is back. Okay. And so is my husband. Okay. Okay. Bye. Thank you. Boy, there was a profound call on the mobile phone. Now, what was it that happened? They were doing all his dirty stuff. It was filthy. It was just downright filthy. I mean, from the minute she came on the stage. Well, he's filthy. She did. I know. I know. She needs like a sponge band. But you would feel that, you know, all just couldn't control it. And he got involved in it. You know, and he, you know how you, the way you word things and the way you ask the questions and stuff like that, you can go in and he's wondering you want to go to a court. Well, of course, sure. Sure. And it was great. I think he needs to say, yeah. He's got it. I'm tapin' to be watching it again when he gets home. Okay. We got two lines open and brown. They don't like you and brown. They love you and the brown. I have never seen such a resistance in my life and in three cranks in a roller. Five, two, four, W. Y. D. Stanisir today because he would like somebody to remember who the hell he is. That's it. We'll be on the air by the way tomorrow night. They got all his crappy Yankee games on it. And nobody more. The next week will be on the air. Well, maybe Bucky Dental gets fired. We'll soon then we'll have a little rush of excitement there. You know, for about a week to lay loose five more. And they really stink. They got beating in yesterday. Anyway, the cubs are looked real good. Now they had 15 hits last night. The reason I'm mentioning a little more about this is because it was a late game. It was not in a son sentinel. Probe sure not in a Harold. And they won seven to four. And the Bucky, he did have one bad inning. But he got the win finally. And Mitch Williams looked good again. They brought it. Awesome. Marker was good and Lancaster and any brother guy named Long. I have no idea who he is who pitched the eighth inning. And he looked good. So the pitching's good. The hitting's coming back. The hawk is going nuts. And you know, Sandberg always slumps an April. And he was just dying in April. Yesterday was the first of May. He went four for four. He had double home run in two singles. Just changed the calendar on that guy. And he was the magazine thing that did it. Henry Barrel is standing by with the 11 o'clock Wiod news. We're going to dig down deep and bring out some of those great stories that uplift you and then we'll come back in 1105. Stan will hang around and try desperately to find an audience. And Rick and Puts at two of this afternoon. The makers of Fury A bottled spring water would like to take this opportunity to apologize for any inconvenience we've caused our customers. And do assure you that the problem has been identified and corrected. The problem was never the water. Fury A spring water remains as pure as it has been for hundreds of years. Nor was the problem with our filtration system. The problem wasn't even the benzene, which is actually kind of tasty once you get used to it. The problem was Bob. Bob is our maintenance man. And Bob has a bladder control problem. If we'd known this, we'd never have let him work anywhere near the spring. But we're happy to announce that Bob's medical treatment seems to be working. Soon, Bob will be back to work. And Fury A will be back on your grocery shelves. Fury A and Bob working together to make water the way nature intended. Well, if I want to stay as guest is excited to hear that, it's 1106 WID. Can I ask, are they buying time on this station? They are. Oh, thank God for that. Okay, WID. Hello.

We're sick and tired and hearing about it already. Rick. You know what's going to happen though? Get off the banana boat already way. When the big guy leaves a lot of people might be going back, right? Well, listen, if they don't like it here, we'll pack him sandwiches. Okay. We'll get a midnight specials, maybe a no che.

I didn't say she's from the waist up. She's not bad. I didn't say she's beautiful. But she's got this gold lemme bathing outfit on. But she's got another waist down. She has thighs, the size of Massachusetts. Okay. If you took the state of Massachusetts and stood it on the cape, it looks like her legs, man. She has got thigh. Well, I guess some guys like that. You know, they like getting locked in for life. Here's a call for Stan. Stan. What? It's Boomer. Don't buy a hot hot hot hot hot hot. Okay, Boomer. Thank you. Oh, God. Now we know why he's a nice guy. Yeah. Okay, wait. Don't take any more calls for Stan. I mean, he wants a call. Stan is kind of like a say he's not here to do a show. You're going to do the same thing. Nick did when I made my first appearance on came show. Tell him not to take any calls for me. All right, remember that? Well, Nick was trying to say it. That's all. But to that seems to be the big thing in this building now. We have all these people like Joey, like a falcher hovering around looking for somebody else's job, Rick and Puts to the same thing. And Bingo, they wind up in the afternoon and just he's to be an epidemic. And I'm getting accused of Jones and for her minimum queen. Well, they would have been very comfortable on a man. Yeah. They would be great in the de moin. I'm not going to start ripping them because they're very sensitive. They got no sense of humor. Everybody thinks they're so funny. They have no sense of humor. You say anything about them. Oh, they're giving these dirty looks in a hall to kneel or sucks. And all, you know, just a radio show. Okay. I can't help it if you guys got a one eight. Oh, excuse me. Here's a mobile and boca. Which is gone? Yeah, that lady. Judy and St. Martin, you're right. Those people in boca suck. Kendall. Hello. Yes. Yeah, and the same to you. Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. Okay. What's going on? I've got a Brian's diary portfolio. Brian, who? Well, you know, you know, your buddy, Don Jr. Yeah. I heard you may like him more than you think. Why? He's pretty nice guy. I hear. He is a nice guy. Listen, I hear there's a new guy. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Now, let's slow down a little bit. What the hell is that supposed to mean? These are the very nice guy. So I hear there's a new guy taking over Stan's what? Who is he talking about? Ben. Teacher. DJ Brian. You're nuts. But I hear there's a new guy taking over Stan's part. You know what I hear? I hear this is a real short call. You know, I see. What? Hi, Neil. Hi. Are you doing? Okay. Must be doing okay. The nuts are all coming back. We must sound pretty good today. It took me coming in here to get it. Yeah. Have you gotten a report of how the book was up there in New York? Yeah. He did it two or two, six or two, five, something like that. He's on a way out. You know what he always says? You know, if we could pull that number up, G, can you imagine what the station was looking like that? Yeah. Well, pull this. It's 11 after 11. We got an open line in date at 751946. Are you doing a bring about? I bet the back of the seven days. This is the eighth day. I've had almost no nuts. So to speak. And you're just, they all come out. You would track them like flies to a sea of lead article on the top of our an other about the commission. Well, at threatening simultaneous notes to do away with simultaneous and on AM. Think about that. Think about one. Think about the ramifications of that for people like QAM and kiss, where they simultaneously have a lot of their stuff. They do. Go on. Who says QAM simultaneous? I don't think they do. Yeah, they pick up a satellite service. I don't know whether it's a simultaneous or not. But for those people, their AM stations all across the country. Yeah, and I think it's a ripoff. I think Simon Casting should be banned. It's just, well, that's what they're working on. Good. Well, I like that commission, man. They got their stuff together. And up there is. The word is, but they are a bunch of fashions pigs. The word is that KFI may end up Simon Casting coast. Because coast is number one. I thought you just told me that like you just signed a contract with them. Well, yeah, you know, how this company is with contract. Well, like I said, Ron, the Knights of the Yankees aren't playing with it. We're going to be picking up the best of last year's games. 11 13 at WIOD. We'll be right back. When it comes to sports, remember this. Mo, no, baseball. Mo, no, football. Oh, no, basketball. There's no denying it. Bo Jackson knows his problems. Okay, 11 16 at WIOD. That was all standard one. Let's take a cut. Now, let's get this lady on who sounds upset. She's gone. See, what now, if they're upset, why the hell won't they come on a year? Okay. What are you people upset about? There's nothing here. Nothing. This morning that you'd have anybody upset. Maybe Rose's call. I shouldn't say, should because we come sensitive, you know, but no, seriously, nothing. There'd been anything depressing. There hasn't been anything. What was the other word? I don't hear. No, no, what was the other word? I'll be sad to be pressing. Negative. I mean, anything, everything has been great. Everything's been positive. It's something about Boca. Oh, yeah. Well, I was just reading the letter and it happens to be true. And Boca and Palm Beach are both open. Okay, as usual, because I know Lee Foll is got a big signing show today. He had, uh, I think Reven Polis on yesterday, didn't they? Oh, I love that Lee. Man, if he isn't stealing somebody else's material, he's stealing their guests. What a slime bag. Mobile. Good morning. You should be doing the Kazaki today. Four. Just Tico. Oh, he's gone. Gone. Oh, right. Let's have a party. Did that make you day? Oh, God. And boy, they finally wise, Dup, eh? Yeah. And after, sure, you were other question that you asked a few minutes ago, the guy they got the pitcher long. Who is he? He's a guy's been hanging around with the white socks on and off for about three years. What is his name? Chuck long? Bill long. Bill long. Like I said, Bill long. And he looked okay. He did he? Yeah, you pitch a good inning. He had one base runner. No problem. Well, long is a short band. And then Mitch Williams came in. Long had to leave. It was really a starter to begin with. And Mitch Williams came in. Got a sixth save. Now, they look, uh, they really got it together now. I don't want to be then one to an arrow to the guy to pick up. No, they're hitting the ball. They're hitting the ball. That was their whole problem. The pitching except for a couple of games was good. But they're now like the match. If I were a med fan at this point, I'd be slashed in my wrist. I noticed they're not calling to that. Well, I'm still waiting to see one flash is wrist. I'll be the happiest guy. Boy, four Atlanta home runs in two by two by the pitcher. I did two. Two by the pitcher. Little a question never hit one before. And darling, the first pitchy throws goes from O to be McDonald for a whole mind. I mean, and then, hold your throws another one away. They look like crap. I would think of you when that was going on. Oh, man, do they look pathetic? I mean, that team is just so if you went down and I don't want to get into a sports thing. But if you took the cups in the Met side by side, I was thinking about this in the shower this morning, immediately. No, seriously. And you took that position by position. Other than Howard Johnson and third who can't figure out a third grade hitter, but he can't feel. But other than him at third, which the cups have nobody at third and and McRennels in left, it's not a contest. Well, I think the cups, and I'm not a cup fan, I'm not a cup hater either, but I think the cups can come pretty close and left even probably by next year. Yeah, they got a shot. That kid develops. Yeah. So, good luck you. Okay. Bye bye. And the same to you. You'll need it. 11 18 at WIOD, your sports intensive station and the course tonight, whether permitting we have the A's, the beating the Yankees again at 730. It's almost not raining in New York anymore. It was supposed to do the WBC television said it was supposed to do. What the hell are you? You mean I'm going to do four hours show. You want to have to come back and oh my god. They showed the forecast for New York for the week, you know, and it said the show like showers and cloudy, but I guess it didn't materialize. Not a Yankees stadium. Well, that's good. My Annie, hello. It's about time. Yeah. I thought you'll love me. Yeah. Hey, man. Oh, what do you want? Good. What do you mean? Well, last year, can I ask you a question? Last year before you tell me the good news, what do you mean it's about time? Well, they had me on the radio a long time. Good. Well, you know, I love you. Probably the who this was. How come he didn't call me? He didn't call last call. I wanted I had a stroke. I wanted to do it. I'm going to buy that. I could notice because somebody that was worried about you and he's doing very good, ready for travel. And he got Michael Lee and he won two races just like great. Well, Freddy's a great guy. Yeah, he is. If I heard, really, he's a proper moment there, which I don't want to get into, but he's a great guy. Yeah. Well, now he's an agent. Good. And he's having a good day. And how is how's your name is, say, doing Bobby Lester, is he coming back here? He's in Oklahoma. Oklahoma. Right. Open your ears, Lester. He's going to come home. Right. Where you boy, Larry, Samel is going to leave my boy. Are they all my boys? I don't get it, Lester. How about my Gonzalez coming? Is he feeling better? He's feeling better. He had an operation in New York. The operation here wasn't too good. Really? And I don't know about the doctors here, don't you? Trust me. I couldn't believe what happened to you. They wouldn't give you a doctor to one week later. No, no, I had to go find my own doctor. That's what I mean. Doctors, they got got their license in a mail order. Yeah. Well, you know what comes down here. Yeah. That's it. All losers. Oh, my gosh. You're right. So we'll see you Saturday. I feel pretty good. If I feel like this, I'll be out there Saturday. If I have to bring Bill on a stretcher, you know. Oh, yeah. How's Bill film? He's coming along. He's coming along. All right. Tell everybody, hope for him. Yeah. And I hope he gets a good job. How are you doing? You making any money or you're a solvent Lester? Uh, I'm just just boarding holding my own loading your own. Yeah. You look last time I saw you. The green shirts starting to do me about two sizes too small. Yeah. I got to get some new shirt. Well, at least you're not missing any meals. That's a good part of it. All right. Okay. Lester. Okay. Okay. Right. 21 after 11. There he goes. A legend that's supported a tracksman. If he ever leaves town to alcohol out of business. We have an opening in date 751 track and in Boca 278 plunge. 278.

I go out there now. In fact, when Bill that I go out to call this and we had our falling out with them. We just we pair a buck to get in. We park, you know, in the regular parking, pay a buck to get in and go and sit in the cheap seats with Ernie. And that's worth.

It's Wednesday. They're racing that he might be on his way already. I don't know. Okay, listen. Let's do a little break here. 21 past 11 at WIOD. We still have it opening in date and Boca. I want to get these all lit up first. And you know, Lester just called. I've been back almost two weeks now. There are a lot of people we haven't heard from. Okay. You're true. No, that I haven't heard from. They're conspicuous by their absence. Okay. And it's really pretty embarrassing. Right. Some of you people know how he's busy in Havana somewhere, who are such a groupies and such loyal Lester. You better get on the stick. Okay. Don't just sit back there and the hold out. Did alcohol you? Alhu. Rand Tell. We'll be right back. If your priority is straightened out, Roger. We're in. Absolutely. L.A. Law theme before not slanting sinful. John van Arck before Susan Day.

Yeah, I think. Yeah, Kathy. I like nurses. Do you? Were you been in the hospital? Sure. I don't know. I ever have any interesting experiences with nurses that we can share? Out of body experience. Oh, I did. Once. Oh, God. I was just not conscious and she took horrible advantages of me. Yeah. I was that why they want to come in and give you a little sponge bath and massage. Is that what that's all about? I never object to that. Yeah, I imagine. Oh, I wanted to ask the personal question to Did Dion ever contact you all your own? No. Well, he don't have my number. He's probably busy making money. He doesn't have time. He did. Donnie, I was the no KC did. I never got back to him. But there was a message that he had called him. Yeah, I saw that. I heard he showed it. I literally dragged when he was out there. Who's your? The sunshine band? KC, Harry KC. Yeah, he's out by Harry Kary. Oh, he's good. He's a good enough. Yes, sir. They're making these making his comeback. So I just wanted to make a school call. Okay. Thank you, back. See you, Charlie. Thank you. See you in Charlie. Call the says glad I'm back in Up yours and that stuff. Okay. Where the hell are all these pinheads? All these a member Eric from the beach history. Long gone. Ricky from the music story called once in seven, but like he's you know roses busy with Leonardo so he's not getting what he wants. And Tim called me at home a couple times history. Long gone, really. Oh, who else? I mean, all these you know they come and they go like a Bob from Cooper City. Not whole crowd. You know, they don't look here. Yeah, but the crowd that you had out of little things are heroes for a little while. That's ah, you know, now we're going on to bigger and better things like the Simpsons. I have one more call about the Simpsons. Yeah, I know. Well, I watch it. Have you seen it? Young Jeff watches it. My step on it. And so it's on there. I have to watch it. But you know, it's I don't want to watch the Simpsons. Okay. Does that make me a bad guy am I negative? Because I don't want to watch the goddamn Simpsons. Very good. Children with the tank. Oh, man. It shows about his funny is instant tumor. It's 1131. And then I found another thing. I wish you got to congratulate. You and I watch those two movies in lieu of the cup game on Sunday night, which was on ESPN, which we were talking about. And the best boys were fan by every find out that the number one movie was Caroline, which I had no idea what that was about. And the beach boy thing was like, way to held down a took a bath. It was a bomb. Nobody watched it. And see, so I'm not going to take the blame for that. I blame all those pinnets who were calling in the end the last week. Oh, you've got to watch the beach boy thing. And you're a big beach boy's fan. We're all going to watch it. We'll talk about it next week. And so I watched that last hour. And that set me back a week in my recovery. I mean, that was so you talk about depressing. It was the home negative. Oh, go. The thing was, yeah, we just for a more voyeurism. Is this a mobile? Oh, my god. 15 minutes. How come I didn't get you on before? Did I punch up through all the other lines? Was ringing on a drive? But you guys are worried that the best team in radio right now. But right here, we got it. Put some slots. Put no, you guys. What you want to slots? What kind of grown-up would watch the Simpsons? Speaking of that, I just mentioned puts and look at that. He's in the other room. What are you doing here? It's not payday. What are you doing here today? I heard you mentioned the other day. They don't know how much they're making. Is that true? You haven't got a deal yet? Boy, you guys are suckers. I have never heard of such a thing. What work is that? And who's and you guys are working Saturdays? Boy, I see they come on like big shots. They all were not doing Saturday. We don't work six days a week. And you know, that pretty soon they're going to fight again 350 an hour and they work seven days. They don't know this company yet. We talk about candy bars. That's why they're still so positive because they think everything is rosy and wonderful. Wait till they're here a couple of weeks. Candy bars? I stand. That's a favorite topic now. Are you guys are greatest? I spent that. How are you talking about? I spent 15, 20 minutes to tell you to just suck up. Just to suck around like those people I heard calling yesterday and he afternoon, sucking around. Oh, you guys are so positive and I nearly is born negative. We want socks. We want fashion. That's what we want. I know using all my material to top it all up. But I love their great guys are going to do wonderful. But I just hope we don't get into this inter-perternal crap and they don't put up with those. Clean bash problem making. Who do you want to bash? I mean, just everybody was just bad. Well, I came into it because Neil said last night he wanted to bash the audience. He hasn't done that. Oh, that would be great. I didn't say that. I just get back to bash and be. I did say that. I think. I would be the one that was before the club's game. Billy, the base plays a douchebag. Where did you find your forever yours sir? Where did you find your milky way, Dart? I didn't find it yet. I'm still looking. I can't find one. Go find one. I can't find one either, okay sir. But I'm still looking. See you later, man. Don't give up. Take it, man. It's 1133 a WI-O-D.

No, I'm serious. They have the people in the combat the teams. And those are the people who just ran off the helicopter and they're all running on the, uh, on the landing strip there. The guy having gone. Maybe the guy was right about DJ had a no way. How was that all about by the way? I don't know. How was that crack? Got no idea. I haven't talked to him for all these people wanted. I think they've been watching too much Hurrah. Let's drag everybody out of the closet. Oh, what's he doing today? He's doing teenage plastic surgery, you know, new, uh, yeah, body parts today. Oh, really? Probably you'd have proved to be far some people from Sally's panel. You know, all the disfigured teams who have like their nose where their ass is supposed to be. Okay. We have one open line or their brains where they're up. We have one in date 751 nose. And if you look at that guy, he can't, he can't stay with them. Look at the guy on the left. Well, the first of all, the shot is so far away. I have no idea what they look like. So I'm not going to waste my time. And 278 W I'm right enough to 7 8 with you shot up 9463 W I O D. Yeah, well, that was quick. Well, I'm picking up live. This is the Arctic Airman. Oh my god. How you been? Great. I'm glad you're back and feeling better. I'm doing better. Slowly but surely doesn't happen overnight, but I'm coming along. Singing a song and strumming my old thing. Yeah, that's a girl in front. Stan, boys, this guy confused too much hanging out with DJ. All right. Here I am. We're going to be doing strum games. Yeah, that's what I heard. Yeah. Well, one is that start. What's this directed games every Saturday that doesn't make sense to me? Uh-huh. Well, all those games will be on television anyway. So it's another real cool. But we're Harry will be on the, uh, maybe I don't want to. Yeah. Uh-huh. Well, I, if the game is on television on GM, Harry does the middle three innings on radio does the other six on television.

As they say, you're entitled exactly. Have a good day both. Thank you. Thank you. Bye now. Okay. That was married, by the way. You don't lie, O. D. Neil. Yeah. Stan is so boring. I can't say why you're on your show. Can I ask you a question? Yes, sir. I can't understand why you're still listening. He's been here since 10 o'clock. I listen to you, Neil.

He doesn't like you, but he likes me, but he's not a fag. That's I am excellent call. Steve is in New York. It's one of Steve's insecure. You know, I never forget that of all the shows he ever did. Even surpassing the urn lady. He had the transsexual. The woman who used to be a guy. And he was going on and talking about how attractive she was. And I don't know if she was married or I don't remember the whole story. But she had was she attractive? Fairly. Snicks are so so. Not to put my job in a sack with her or something. And so that segment of his called the insecure super macho males went nuts. Steve, please, you wouldn't read him. If you knew you really wouldn't do it. If you knew, oh god, it was the funniest. It was the most embarrassing but funny stuff I have ever heard, man. In secure. Wiod. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Okay. What's going on today?

Don't you miss all the eating? No. Really? I had one guy. That's another thing yesterday. Here. Some of these people are so pathetic. I mean, it's embarrassing. How bright you have to be to understand that when somebody is fat and they've had a heart attack or a stroke or some horrendous thing because they're out of shape and they're fat. And the guy calls it, oh, we sure miss your eating. And I'm trying to explain to him. I just, you know, and it does, he's oblivious. Oh, no, that was so much fun. We used to have lunch right along with it. We sure that was like, well, a high light of the show for us. I'm trying to explain to him. Don't hold your breath because it's not going to happen. And just a mister old oblivious. Yeah. So in other words, entertain us in the pig out. We don't care if you dropped it. But we want to be in psychos. People I heard calling in yesterday afternoon. I don't want to say what show. But, um, no, seriously, it's just the same concept. You know, the guy had a stroke and he's like, um, not 100%. But hey, he's depressing. We don't want to hear about that. Okay, fine. I feel great. Okay. Everything is wonderful. People who live in Lala land and total dream worlds. You know, like, like, the thing about nobody or like Howard Beale said, nobody gets cancer and Archie bunkers house. And they, they really do. They live like in a radio existence. Like in a fantasy land. Well, these are the same people who wanted you back quicker than you helped with. Oh, yeah. Come right back to entertain them. And if I happen to drop it because I did it well. Somebody else would be on that. You know, Nick and so I'll bash them. You know, anyway, it's 1148 and shells, of course, has become. He is still. Oh, it's Vegas. You know, the thing they got here, you're welcome on the SPN is like, um, someone's like a porno movie. You know, there's, uh, once in a military where there were and the fatigues in a whole bit, you see, no. Anyway, Nick will be giving you titles if you call in. I will see those. Yeah. You don't want to open park. Hey, Neil, no negative. Yeah. Let's be positive, sir. I don't want one. Let's be beat up. I'm sorry, you're doing okay. And it's good to hear a stance, my own voice. Yeah, all right. Mr. and Freakwin see over here. Yeah, I'm just here once in a while. Yeah. All next week, sir. Oh, really? Yep. Yeah. You're going out west. So a couple days they'll be on like at nine 30 or 10 o'clock, something like that. But for some strange reason they're playing some afternoon games. Thank God. Yeah, really. Yeah. Let's carry though. It's starting in about 1130 in a morning with a pregame show. A selfie to give Stan frequency. Yeah, six to three. I love his. That's a stupid cake. W abc sports talk show that they carry for 30 minutes at the end. Oh, yeah. Well, that really puts us in a hopper. I'll tell you about a point three with that. Well, we want to compete with QAM. We want to match them at night with about a point three and a point one and point this. Well, us and have a great day and an even better life and a bigger and better tomorrow or something. I tell you, I shouldn't say this because then they'll drop off but considering it's almost noon and pretty good that they heat you like poison. We're not doing too bad. Well, that's it. If you got a four few more hate call, there's the guy with a Spendex tight there on the right with those two. Now the one in the middle she's very attractive, but she is got well everything on her is big. And on the her eyes. Oh, you don't think she would bring us she's a pick. Oh, I cannot hate and women. I understand that but I'm saying from the waist up she was very attractive. Maybe just took her neck and stuck her boobs and a few other parts together, but her thighs are like Montana. She may see other one look like Karen Carpenter. Hollywood. Yeah, I on the vocal line. Yeah, well, it's I don't mind spending the money. I'll add this good. I just want to tell you I enjoy doing on the negative things. You don't think that they need to fool themselves and then think that this really is. Yeah, those escapists out there that want to hear about, you know, about basside and about the South Beach and our Drecco and about Alex Dowd and what a great guy he is and he never stole a free train, but what the hell was he doing in Peter Clayton's will? I mean, what the hell is it all about, right? It's this is the real life show here. What is he doing in Peter Clayton? I don't want to talk about Peter Clayton because I couldn't control myself. I get a lot of trouble. Well, listen, you guys covering the talk show draft next week? Yes, sir. Excellent. Matter of fact, we're going to be lining up a lot of weekend people here at WIOD from that international talk show draft. Some of them don't even speak in place. I was just going to say this probably some good prospects overseas, but we don't give a damn as long as they show up in a worksheet man. That's where it's at. Hey, keep it up this place sucks. Okay. There is one of our good positive colors. That's the kind of guy we like he's honest. But have a nice day. Okay, 55 in WIOD. I see. See what I'm just mean. I shouldn't have said anything. Now we got four left. Uh oh. And it will take one now. And then by the you watch when we come back after the new news, there'll be one call. Maybe nobody. It does it. It's just the noon thing. And it takes like a half hour to start all over. And it's like what happens at five o'clock to a freaking frack. Mr. and Mrs. positive in there. Hey, but then all of a sudden hey, what happened? We had a brick wall. See, they'll get familiar with it. They have only been doing this a short period of time and said a little honeymoon. That grace period.

I'm glad to have you back. It's real for selfish reasons, though. Is it? Well, yeah. I mean, you know, I listen to you every day. Well, let's not talk about it on the air, Rick. Let's not get into it on the air. Your wife will be very upset. Nobody knows at this point. I just thought you're a good one, Neil. Oh, I do. Ha ha ha ha ha. Why the head? Why the head? The one. Why the head lipstick? Well, let's pitch with my image. How about the least? Do you like that? That green stuff coming out of your mouth. It's it's a sea foam green. Yeah, well, I had lost with Linda Blair, you know. Great, interesting. Yeah. Did you do that? Wait till you see the billboard of Sally that they're going to put up. But I don't want to. I don't want to delve into that. But that's another story. No comment. I got you. You need to get out of the rumors of your. Your eyes were greatly. Do you see the things I was trying to run? W had do when I came back. One said, Neil had a stroke. But he had a second and a third stroke. And he's posed from one half of his body. When they were talking about all those strokes, that was something else that we're talking about. There were some exaggerated stories going around. Well, you know, my agent, Chicago saw Fuji was telling me that he was getting calls from people all over the country. Some of whom I know personally. Some of whom I don't even know. And he said it was obvious that with some of the people they were legitimate, they can serve it. And with others, it was the vulture syndrome. You know, if he really going to drop dead and is there going to be an opening? And where do we send the tape? You know, that kind of stuff. I saw doing who? Oh, Salah's great. He's the best. Good.

Tell her to stop frowning all the time. Things aren't that bad. We don't like depressing negative people in this town, Rick. We like it to be positive and upbeat. Especially when you're covering all those gory blood and guts things that you guys love. Listen, have a good one. Thanks for having me. I'll write them. Rick Sanchez is becoming chronic. Oh, wait a minute. You're not going away, are you? I'll say what I'll call you back after the news. Oh, I'm not even. Oh, you got to do now. Are you serious? Oh, I'm crushed. Oh, I'm not my gorilla. That's it. I'm finished. When even he leaves you with noon, you know. There is no hope. It's a good looking guy though. Chuck Myers is a Chuck is standing by with a news. Chuck's got some real interesting stories we can think our teeth into and we'll be right back. Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny don't exist. Japan will millions and billions of dollars. And we're all going to die. It's the noon to one hour. Okay, everybody happy. It's 12.05. What are you doing? Get away from that screen, William. The amazing part of it is looking at the blonde guy in the back row. That's the good guy. Anyway, this guy, if anybody's watching the SPN and our number two of aerobics today, the guy in the front who's like the cheerleader he is on there every day. He looks just like Jamie Gillis. Oh, he's getting the glasses. Look at the girl behind him and look at the that guy behind her and what are they doing? It's not bad. Yeah, oh, really. Let's go to don't start doing fag stuff.

Well, you shook me and you didn't have to pull with your dip, but you did it and you drove me right into neutral systems. Good. Yeah, I lose that fat man. I'm telling you. It's not a laughing matter. When and well, I've listened to you forever. These morons out there who want to just make light of it, make a big joke of it and keep shoving down his. I'm telling you, the day comes when you have to pay the price. It's not a happy deal. I'll tell you. Yeah, I can't. And I've listened to you forever. And I've never called you. And I used to call Bill and and when you were sitting with Bill once and a while or you. Bill, who with you? That other fellow from Quinn. Oh, I remember him. Well, I remember him. Bill called her. Yeah. But whatever happened to me is recuperating is coming along. Well, I speak to Mary today and he's he'll be okay. He'll end a thing. But at the meantime, the most important thing is your health. Absolutely. Okay. So the fact that he isn't going to go over there with those slime bags and their point two shares a QA and believe me in a long one will be the best thing. And I'll ever have him. Well, I'm enjoying you and Stanley T. And I'm going to leave you with just a lot of good luck. And I want to ask you one other question. Yes, sir. When a condo commando goes swimming in a pool to the swimmer float. Well, we have an expert coming on on a Rick and put you on Wednesday next week to answer that question.

What kind of a response is that? I don't know. I've got every line lit here. It looks like, I mean, it's frightening. You think that the audience is actually, you know, Wendy, they're way back here. I'm still a little stiff after Rick Sanchez is called. Well, I don't want to hear about that. I don't want you to personal. Let me ask you, does he look a little pop here as a my imagination? He is a little poppy. You could lose some weight too, Rick, to go into the black beans and rice, you know. Yeah. You know, it's interesting. Now, this has nothing to do with him. Because he's a good guy. We know he's full of crap. But, uh, listen to me. More, it's like Mexicans, okay? Yeah. And there's all that poverty there. But the, the, the, maybe I'm wrong. It's just like in America with poor black ghetto neighborhoods. There are a lot of people who are fat, not because they've got a lot of money. They eat a lot of big meals. But because the food that they start to, you know what I've seen? Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, yeah. And the more affluent, well, I think a barber Jordan was fat. But I mean, how many prominent black people can you think of? Who are, you know, got some bucks? Who are fat? Hmm. Not too many. Opera one free. Well, all right. Well, some days. Well, a lot of seriously. And, uh, just stop it. Think about that. I have no idea what I'm talking about. What does that mean? I don't know. Oh, no. I was thinking of a work set. I was just thinking about the same with the, with latins. It's the same thing. Yeah. Well, don't you tend to retain water when you need start your food? Yes. So therefore the puffiness. I don't know what it means. What does it mean? Like, doctor showed up, so we're still depressing and so morbid and very negative. Don't be so negative, Phil. What? Where's hip go apart, then? I have no idea. Is he around? Where's he? He's got vacation again. He's put out the California at the fat farm. He's back out there again. Yeah. Oh, he was back. He's been gone three weeks. Didn't he just say he's out of the count or he was out? Yeah. And he's back. He just, yeah. I saw him on channel. And as he lost him way again? Because he doesn't tell anything. He's sitting at the accurate. The only way he loses is in his wallet. He goes out there and go to Hollywood Park in Santa. And he loses about 10,000 probably. So he looks like two pounds lighter. And then a week later he gets all speaking of puffy. Yeah. And I'm telling you, Hank, I hope you're listening. No, you're laughing, but I'm serious. There is another candidate. And for all the joke, and Hank is a great guy. Really is for all the joke and back and forth. But he needs to lose some weight. He really does. I've watched. Yeah. He can't pass it away. He really can't. I don't know anybody fat who can't pack it away. How about a whole fat rich? What's that fat picture for the met? Is it Hernandez? Sid the kid. Who's really not doing too great? What a smile. I want about my virility. I don't want to hear about this. Okay. Like here at about Andy Rune's sex life. I don't want to hear about it. Did you get an invitation to E.J. He's wedding? No, I didn't. How about DJ's wedding? Because I'm beginning to hear some story about him. I heard stories about DJ long ago. Oh, Jesus. I was hanging out at the button south. Oh, come on. Next to be Tommy was hanging out at Uncle Charlie's. There's something. Let's cut the crap. Can we? Cowboy Delf. The copa. The copa is not there anymore. There is a plate. It's not there. No one in one club. Now, why are you not in a green or you child? I don't know. The copa hasn't been there for ages. That's the copa. I'm thinking of back street. Why don't know about all those back places? I don't know about that. I'm thinking of back street. I hope it's the back street. How do you know? Nick is not here. It's out of how do you know? Oh, look at that. He's getting right in the face. And when Nick gets right in the face, it's really quite an accomplishment. Look at that. What the hell is he know about the copa? Wow. Oh, Paul. Paul. Paul is there. Remember this about some of the good old days. He's a w. Oh, by the way, Hank and Joel be on sports targets. It's just so five tonight. So we'll spice it up a little bit. I don't want to say Joel is boring, but no, he's not. Joel is okay. He's a bit too wide. We pick on you. He's one of those people who's convenient. He's in easy target, okay? And it's terrible that we keep doing it. I miss him and man. Did you get it out? Have a nice day. Good night. 23 past noon at WIOD. Did I say, uh, back street and kids all the same. So let's say, oh, yes. No, back street hasn't been there for a long time. And it's that restaurant. What the hell is that Mexican restaurant? That's in there now. It used to be one of Steve sponsors or, um, Oh, come on. The Lanyap Cajun house. It's not Mexican, but it was Lanyap Cajun house. Isn't that there? Because Steve took me there with norm Kent one, because it was free. Okay, 24 past noon. We have an open line in Dave County at 751. Think he's getting any freebies in New York. Well, he's given free autographs. I know that at the baseball card shows. We'll be right back. Here's what you'll mind of Miss. Yesterday afternoon with Rick and Sots. What? What? It's a crazy, every time it's just a simple cut. Palm Beach, Miami, Delaware. I don't know. At least one song. Gee. Well, nice job. I, I, I, I, I got Mark that one. Yeah, yeah, Mark that.

Take that seatbelt off. Yeah, take join Rick and Sots. This afternoon at two. I knew talk radio 610 W. IOD. Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by. Sometimes I feel that people don't want this mind. Anyways, 12, 28 W IOD. One thing, Mark in the dark in West Palm Beach, who sent me baseball analysis and reporting and scouting and all this other for both leagues. American National League. And I guess I can analyze all the players and all the teams now. Thank you very much, Mark. Whatever this stuff is. 28 Pass Noona W IOD. Blowfly. Yep. Hi, Neil. The real one. The real one. I'll be got. Sure. The real one. I'll be got. Well, they told everybody I left town. Yeah. Right in the week, ladies and gentlemen, I woke up again and turned from doing a movie called a twisted world of blowfly. Really? Yeah. I sure wish we could play a record Johnny. You're like the good old days. But you know, we got all these fanciest picks up there. Watch them or up tight. I just finished an album. I like it. One more song. And I want to do one call. Radio versus TV. I over the whatever you want to call it. And I want you to put them together for me. And I got a track. And I put it to music. Okay. Yeah. You don't have to. You don't have to land. Just write the truth. So whatever you think from way back up in the hell. And now just on the weekend, you've me and another than yours. No, sure we can. Okay. We need a little bit of a risk in the week. Okay. We're doing a part of the work. And I'll be calling you back when you put them together. Great. And then I will probably get a band in a four-later nail. Okay. The flag that here is from there. Take care of yourself. Don't just say, okay. Bye. Bye. Bye. What a guy. Those were the days, huh? When we had an audience. Well, hey, listen. I can't help it. I mean, now everything has to be. Oh, yes, sir. No, sir. I don't know if you're going to be in a fashion country. And the people in the career too stupid or I'll know you go. It's been negative again. He's been negative. We don't want to hear that. We already know the world has screwed up. We want to escape. We want to see Madonna rubber thing against our senior's head. That's it. That's what it's all about. God, what a thought. Your stats pat sacred. Miami. Thank you, aboard. Okay. Well, I think we got the message the first time, pal. But if it's so boring, how come you're still there? And you keep calling back. Stick your finger somewhere else beside in the phone, okay? Might be a big improvement. A 751 puts in Dave County. We have it opening there. Also, Boken, Pobby, jumping up again like the dead sea. Or is it the red sea? The red sea? Whatever. I see. Waterhill. Is waterhill gone? See, this was all these were phony baloney. You know, he gave us a false sense of, I totally have it in God. Where they all, yeah, I just told you that. Right. And then half of Mark Cranks anyway. A four-lautardale. Yeah. Yeah. How long was that break a minute ago? It seemed like about seven minutes. How long was it? It, we invent the seven minute break. Three and a half. It says here, I wasn't paying any attention. I was opening this thing. Got it. It seemed longer than the four minute one yesterday. Well, we're working on about a 20 minute break. That's probably not a good thing. I'll all greed radio just all spots. My boss wants to know when the news is fighting. I can go back to work. Uh, want to clock half hour time. I got a hold on that long. Yes. Oh well. Put me back on hold then. Hold on tight. 1231, a WIOD. Broward, Boca, Pop Beach. Three open lines here. It's glaring. We're still not hearing from those embarrassing people. I guess they're gone. They're gone forever. See what I mean? Fickle. Fickle town. WIOD. Yeah. Yes. Kathy Livingston. Hi, Kathy. How are you? Good. Can I just talk to me on brief later? Sure. Hold on a second, Kathy. Okay. We have a boat and we got Broward filled up. They're two seven eight knots. Oh, we got the knots landing team. Okay. Now I get that other one out of my life. I don't want to hear that crap. Let's talk about Paige. Yeah. The hot sliding lady's going to get a very high for her. She hears this. So a little more. I think that was just lost the call. I don't want LA law. Put that away, Rob. If you don't even see the car. Thank you, Rob. Good thing, Otty. Okay. Here's William D'Aven playing a Jack Nicholson playing the Joker. Did you see Batman? It's a good show. It was a good show last week. It was a good show last week. The problem over there. There I go being negative again. It's by the way. I have a theory about one aspect of it. Wild. If you're at it. Hi. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Can barely hear you. Well, I can hear you. You can. Yeah. Good. I just want to tell Stan Hi. And I hope there's a chance that he'll come back and after him. Oh, don't start this up again. Please. No, I don't want to eat. Let's stop all of that. I'm not a failed if in morning. He's running. Oh, God. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Cut the crap. This station is like drowning from all this bickering and infighting. You know, used to be fun. It's not fun anymore. It's like a disease here. It's got to stop. We plan to changing our lineup like you change your lineup. We just can't do it. Let's bash the Yankees though. Exactly. Rip the Yankees. Anyway, well, we can't get Stan back or someone else. I guess we just have to look forward to you and not planning. That's about all there is in this town. Are you like not slanting? I love it. Hey, I have a theory. You know, the security guy that's stalking Michelle. Uh-huh. He is not the one. It's the TV producer that's doing all the naughty stuff. Oh, you're kidding. No, I'm not kidding you. The security guy is going to be home. He's going to turn out to save her life. How do you like that? Well, we have to have the all-wait and see. Okay. That'll be our cliffhanger for the season. That's it. You sure it's not the producer, the woman. The big-out it is. She's behind it all. I thought you meant the guy. No, she's behind it all. That would be too obvious because that's what they're trying to make it look like. No, no, no. Anyway, I got to go and get my accent. Okay. Have a nice day. Have a happy day. Bye. 1234. Your happiness station Wildewyord where everybody is. So damn happy. It's almost sickening. What is that? They're children. What are these people? Are they for like 10 seconds and they go off? Sure. Is there something new that's happening between noon and one like a life that's going on this town? Because I don't know if it would never head like this in the noon hour. We used to have it for all four hours. It's that guy on Zeta. Oh, Wild. Hi. Could I speak with Neil? Sure. Hold on a second. Wild. Hello. Goodbye. Ooh. That must have been. Okay. Now, W.B.R. Makein' those calls again. 524 Wildewyord in the Broward and 278 Puts in Boca. Rick and Puts will be along at two. They got open phones today tomorrow. They have the World Federation Wrestling. Do Spags or whatever it is. And they've got. What is it? You already took it off. If you're macho king Randy Savage will be on for some of those real macho guys that we heard from earlier. And also for some of you silly savages in the audience. Wild. Hold on. And we have two open lines in Broward. I'm really pumping these numbers today just to make a point. I don't know what the point is, but it's fun. 524 Wild. Palm Beach. Hey Neil. It's not for any lady. Hey. How you doing? I told you we didn't spar you with that music. I know it. What the hell is going on there? Are you in roses house? I'll tell you. You know what I think you're right. I agree with you. That it's the guy producer. I don't know. No, I didn't say it was. I thought that's what Stan was talking about. That's what I think it is. Do you? Yeah. Because he's coming on like he's Karen's good body and best friend. And I think he's like trying to get her in the sector. He's trying to one. He's trying to be your good buddy, but he's going to be a nice night. Yeah. Well, he's a little bizarre anyway, so it's possible. He's not normal, like most of the people on that chart. Like Val. Like Val. Yeah. I love Val. Please. Can I do you hear the bad news about Val though? She like got rated the worst character ever. I don't care. She's beautiful. Now, there is depressing and negative. I mean, there is no pressure getting back with Gary and everything. Oh, please. Well, you know what they belong to. Nothing is ever fine with her, okay? And then did you hear that the her ex husband that disappeared was who's now a auto-race driver or something was in that list of in people magazine and the 50 most beautiful people in the world? Yeah. You're kidding. What was his name? Um, something. What was it? Ben? Yeah. How's he been? He's been better than Danny. I'll tell you one thing. If he's one of the 50 most beautiful people in the world, there is hope for anybody. Even Howard Stern, even Howard Stern, he had page was in there. And Michaelette Sheridan was in there. Pat Peterson didn't make it though. Does that tell you everything you need to know? Yeah. But Samburg was there. Yeah, which also he did belong there. He had a real good. That was a very flattering picture of him too. By the way, yesterday, somebody asked, it's not 90. Somebody, yesterday was I think a hundred nine games in a row without an air. And he's also consecutive chances broken at record by two. Pat Peterson. Pat Peterson. Samburg. Samburg's not doing too bad either. Samburg's right on his tail. So the speaker had a dare. I think. What? I'm not kidding. Well anyway, let's go this week. Michael and Linda are going to do something. Yeah, I think this week tomorrow will be really good. Maybe it may be a kiss on a cheek. You know, he starts very slow. He don't want to just jump right in anything. I'm like last year when he and Paige were really getting into it. Right. That's what it was good. Boy, that was good. It was good. Two beautiful people. Man. Hmm. So, Stan, you got a satellite dish. How are you going to watch it tomorrow? What do you mean? I have cable. Why thought you were working? No, Lori tapes it. She doesn't watch it. We watch it when I get home. Oh, okay. She doesn't watch it. She tapes it. That's a real dedicated life for you. Absolutely. Oh, she'd nice to you and watch it anyway. And I think the comes have the day off tomorrow. So, I have to worry about any game because they're coming home to play the pod rays and the Braves. Wow, am I looking forward to those braves? Well, I'm looking forward to my satellite dish. Good. Are you really getting one? Yeah, I'm really getting one. Great. Well, I listen. I finally track down. Remember all those calls we had a few months ago about the alleged feed. Yes. Well, it comes over on Tuesday night Wednesday morning at 350 AM on the Canadian satellite. Anic one on Channel 4. Have you ever taped it? No, because I just discovered that while I was sitting in home with nothing to do. There's a couple of weeks. I was scouring to the satellite guide. Great. And it comes through. I know nothing about it coming through a nine o'clock in the night. It does. It's not listed anywhere. And I can't find it. But a three. So if you just said you're machine. Right. You can get to the new episode of day before anybody else goes. That sounds interesting. And then call Neil. That's what it was watching. Call Neil and tell him all about it. For example, I'll ask for everybody. That sounds good. Okay. So maybe next week I'll be able to do that. Please. Okay. Okay. Okay. We'll talk to you. Well, 43 a W I O D. The Nots Landing Boy. Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. I agree. I think it's the, uh, the female producer that's trying to, uh, put it over on Karen. Oh, but that would be too obvious. Well, that, what do you expect, you know? Yeah. I was just that Hollywood. Yeah. I was watching that. I was up the last night. I guess it's about two in the morning. And a Channel 39 here. And a really old episodes of Matt Flanding, where they're like, uh, Karen's wearing, like, Dolby, I'm jeans and Gary was an alcoholic. Are you cereal? Yeah. What now? What time was this? So I think it was about two in the morning, two or two 30. And they should. I remember when they were showing in the daytime about 11 in the morning. I don't remember what Channel was and they were showing all those episodes from about five years ago. Boy, that was some interesting stuff. It is interesting. It's interesting to see how all these things develop and know what. There were a lot of things developing. Belester on fat beaters and was 11. And boy was not 11. He was about 18. Barely legal, but that's okay. This one, Gary was a, Gary was an alcoholic. He was just drinking. Hey, listen, if Mr. Watch his name, they used to be here and watch 12 year old Twinkies on dance party. I can, uh, got talk about desperate. So it was pretty interesting. And Gary was with, uh, was with Abby. Yeah. Donna Mills. Yeah. Well, they ran out of gasoline for the lens. They could use that filter anymore. It was just custom to name. I was to get her off the show. And so they did. I was to bring her back. You know, she was, she had a certain element, you know, like, costility. I thought they were going to portray Olivia at to be, uh, in her mold. But, uh, so they'd buy the way. Now, whatever happened, she came to Miami. I bet if we conducted the search, we could find Olivia and, uh, what's his name? Harold, Harold. Yeah. I got to, we could find them. I think I saw them on the turnplay class. Yeah. They could, uh, they could like double date with Sean and, uh, Madonna. They'd been both a couple of slime bags, uh, who look like they haven't been in about 10 years, especially Harold. And maybe they'll run in the Nadia and her boyfriend Nadia. Yeah. Okay. The old family talk. Thanks for the memory. Okay. Okay. Well, 45. I don't know you. I did. I didn't know that was the case. I feel very negative and depressing. Oh, after the not slanting thing? No. Just in general. Evan's on a connections out of the car right now. He was a boy and a guy. No, man.

right right right okay you're hired yes yes yes if you like to do what do I think are any so-chun yeah maybe we're in a laughing stock of the history of radio sir yeah that's why he's got a point three sir we have an opening and date what in Broward and one pombie we have Stan we have Rick of Rick and Puts Puts is in the other room of putting on his darkseye socks W I O D I now hold on one moment please oh no did you go ahead and you can't get a call I can't believe it okay I'll he said a lot of business on out of the ford unusual but Marvin was telling like Ryan Sandberg going there he had like four consecutive days that he showed up why if you've got to tell you you're answering your own phone I'm sorry, because no one's going to make sure. Well, I wanted to be the lady. She's trying to talk. Oh, it's a seller put her on hold. I thought they'd be pressing. They got a crappy attitude, man. I'm getting really sick of it. What was that? I like to look at the positive things in life. Like go and home into a clock and watch the cubs win. So I have something else to do. But if they lose tomorrow, it'll be real negative in the pressing again. You guys are great team. Cut the crap. Go ahead. OK, go ahead. I'm reading as an amagazine. And it says, at first time, there's been no further work from CBS on its plan to launch a summer spin off, theory, starring young Pat Keter. Yeah, we got that. It's a time back. Yeah. Wow. So that's how it's going to be. Why do you think I'm taking a whole summer off? I'm going to have a little relapse right about the first to do. We'll have to wait and see. Yeah, won't that be exciting? Yeah. I don't know if you can get through the whole summer without doing anything. But knowing the way they're written at character, I think it's possible. Did you didn't hear the interview? Did you hear the unique character? What is it? Did you hear my interview with him? Yes. And then he's here on autograph. He said, loving kisses. And I think there was something on it. He started a little, certainly after the third guy called in and talk about Nicolette Sheraton. Yeah, they did a lot of them talk about her. Yeah. I don't think they get along well. I think they should schedule him again to call. I think he should call me. He was photographed near by the way. I think he should. Celebrity, what is this celebrity sleuth? He's not interested in that. Celebrity was about Peter. And being photographed in the new. Yeah, where do I get down? Turned out it was a look alike. Did you hear that? That. The cart started. And it stopped. It stopped. Rogers got these things. Rick, these are LA law machines. He started to stop like a automata. What is that louder one, huh? Wow. Break it up and piss off the LA law fans. And GTR. That's it. Oh, did I hit that little poster? That was good. It was nice. Anyway, almost like Ricky Tickey yesterday. Give you a hat. Yeah. So anyway. Well, it's going to be a real throw tomorrow night. And if I pick it up on a satellite, I'll spoil it for you tomorrow. Okay. Okay, see. It's 11.5 to one. It's one of those phones. They're pretty good today. Aren't they? We had a couple of dumb moments. But considering that Stan is here and knowing how he's pressing and boring he is, it's been, and he actually brought out some of the people who hate him. Some of those young up. Huskhead. I heard. Huskhead. That gets the whole. I get everything. Sure. That gets his blood boiling man. What? Makes him feel good. Who? People call in and bitch at me. Me? Makes you feel good. I don't want my blood boiling. And I know why my, I just want to be nice and calm. Like I have been all day. You don't see me getting hysterical. Right? Oh, yeah. All right. We have an opening in date. It's getting real upset about that. Because the Rick and Puttero is surveying the situation. They never have any other lines on their show. They're the same as Neil Rogers. They have visual signals. That's a lot. No, we, they were full of five o'clock. I just said that. Yeah. You were talking to your biggest bunch of puss heads. I heard it. What? How many wildeens hit those guys out of your studio? Exactly. What the hell are they doing here? Get them out. What the hell? What the hell do you want sir? Exactly. This caller was right. All right. We'll take a break while we try to rectify the situation. It's one 12 into the wild. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I prefer a stand major. I personally don't. There you have it. Nine out of ten doctors. I prefer a stand major over general anesthesia. One 16 in WI. The area for the existing. Yeah. But the interesting part about that car. I was just thinking that. Is that about half the voices on there. I no longer hear that's true. And I think if you wait about another three months. Here's a mobile and broad got to be gone. Got to be gone. I'm here. I can't believe it. What a loyal caller. Hey, I hung out through the accident. God, I might just got must be ready to rip us. I know. Got it all. What a nice guy. I'm a good guy. You can't be in South Florida. There will be a negative again. Because you don't know. I'm a native. For here in nineteen six. Well, we apologize to you. Okay. Not that I did it. But a lot of people owe you an apology. They do. I accept them. They don't do this town. How anybody can question. I mean, I've been here a long time doing this. I don't like this in my second week. Okay. So the young pseudo would like the young sueds. That's a new soap opera coming soon to Fox. The young sueds. Well, I'm the best data here. Great. And you know, did you move out of where you lived? No comment. No comment. I don't discuss anything about where I live, where my knife is. What am I? Well, that must have been my neighbor's across the street. Oh, okay. And number two, someone called it. I think it was Rick said that. As a matter of fact, people across the street did move in. Just the very day you're talking about. Okay. Rick said stand looks like Gary Lee Lewis. No. I think stand looks like Max on hard to heart. Well, I don't want to show someone who Max is. No, he looks more like Galileo the leprechaun. Oh, close. Yeah. That's wrong with that. That is pretty good. Exactly. That's what I'm talking about. I think he's going to give three leprechaun call. That's my favorite. I can't believe that guy followed me from went. Oh, so what about how about the guy with Lardas? He follows you every woman. Oh, he's not a loyalist. That's what we want. I don't care if they're good or not as long as they're loyal. And did you know that Gilbert was that with Rick and Sputs at the art show? We just told me that he showed up as if I was supposed to be surprised. Well, not only that, but right before they went off the air, he had the thing, take me out to the ball again. Oh, God. Are you serious? Oh, I'm serious. Oh, no. They're wonderful guys. They're doing great. The whole audience seems to love them, but please get an act. I mean, don't, I can't embarrass him, you know? Don't do my show. Don't do my show and my, oh. I can say they're in production. I'm not putting it on. I was like, tripping over the roadways I heard it. I know. Well, listen, that's one thing they can steal with my blessings. I'll pack a sandwich. I'm here. You would. Okay. Have a wonderful life. Yeah. I don't want to say hello to my friend Tony and Jay. I've been that God for second place of Lake Worth. Okay. Are they over 100? No. Just under. Must be getting close. Have a good one. Bye-bye. One 19 at WIO Day, we have an opening in Brower, if you move very fast, like lightning, as Steve used to say, I wonder where he's going to wind up. You're looking at me? No, I'm just thinking out loud. I'll be back working for Dennis Compton. Well, he, oh, geez. What a quinole of an A. That's going to be. They aren't going to pay him the giant now. They're not going to pay him that kind of money. He can't afford to live on what's it out of getting the last start. Oh, right. Go to anyone. But two one in the Moile. That's big. Yeah. Oh, their whole station is in the toilet. If you think we went down, they were like non-existent. Not only is it's not only what the share is, but then when you analize the demographic, it's how Debbie do. Plus, she had a two four, I think. No, they were all the twos. Yeah. Except at night, I don't know. I think what you had a three or something, which is like a big number over there now. They're dead. You realize the shift that they have him or what? The shift they have which near working eight until one. Yeah. Which is not his hours at all. Which is why they're dying because they don't know. And in that sports thing, they put in there. Oh, they had like a point five in the seven o'clock hour. Although they did beat QAN who had a point three. Our sports between six and eight was like double. Those two stations put together. Okay. And would he be even higher except for Yankee baseball. Twenty-and-a-two. So what? All the new stations. No, I was on three. They all went up. I don't believe it. Across the country. Oh, come on. They did. Get out of town. They did. On green acres. Okay, twenty four after one, a WIOD. We're having a wonderful day. We're trying to be upbeat, not depressing, not too... You're really... Just doesn't sound like the old Neil. Up yours. Let's go to Pomponol. Hey, how are you two wonderful? Okay, we're having a great day, pal. It's a beautiful day at the Magic City. Oh, beautiful. By the way, before at the risk, look at what all it... The risk of being negative. I forgot to mention that the people in Metro traffic need an animal. I mean, they have the last few days. You know, I haven't been back that long, but my God, every time you hear for a traffic, it's either the wrong person or there's nobody there. And when they do give the traffic, it is so wrong. I was coming to work this morning. I was going to get off the turnpocket to Golden Glaze. And Joe, what's his name? Brennan is saying, oh, it's all backed up at the Golden Glaze. In 95, it's a big delays. We went through there. I mean, all of... I'm going to say we're the traffic, including myself about 65 miles an hour. There was no delay. There was no problem anywhere between there and here. And they are just so far out of it, man. They better get off those hallucinogens because they're losing it. They're nuts. Go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. Well, it's trying to be positive. I know. You know me, Mr. De Prussian. Yeah. So damn, man. It's a beautiful day. It is. It's a great day for doing it. Hello. Hello Rick. So anyway. Finally, I listened to last night on the defensive driving school. I had a one of those. What do you want to know? What do you want to know? Smartass, punk said drives about 100 miles an hour in the school zone. Being known, no, no. I just run over old people and hell and they are good. Good. Good. Good. Good. So I stroll down to the. The little drunk store. Coined drunk store to have down. By the way, if there are any tourists still in town, the Hallendale J. Walking Comic Casi is will be doing their things straight into a clock this afternoon on Hallendale Beach Boulevard. You don't want to miss it. Don't definitely don't miss it. Get over and make the fourth race in golf. It's a great day. It's a great wonderful wonderful day. Don't miss it. Although they're not open to their golf stream, but you can't lose a dime. So anyway, you're doing a hundred. You know what? You want to go down the stairs for the quick 10 minute break in my defense driving class. And along the hill in the bottom shelf on these 45 cent cany machine with a Milky Way dark bar. Wow. And did you get it? Of course. And I got off six of them. No wonder you're so happy today. Yes. Well, I was happy. I was happy this morning when whatever they came out of. Okay, but when your blood sugar goes up to 600, you'll really be happy. I'm young guy. I'm young guy. I know. You can add look. Well, this is a wonderful day. I'm glad you liked my candy bar. And remember, and never forget that this is a wonderful city and a wonderful town. And it was a wonderful call. Thank you very much. And Bill and Ted say hi. Okay, bye. And for every year's lives. 27 after one. The only reason you're trying to pump candies because you keep buying those sugar's futures. You're not fooling anybody. Okay. I just bought one of the airways for personal gain. Okay. Little expose about Italian Sanchez over here now. It all penny Daniels did my broker call. We got a little expose here. The man with his cover futures is a pedaling candy bar to rot your teeth and ruin your health ladies and gentlemen. Don't pay any attention. Heartless, cruel bastard for Lauderdale. Uh, the yacht? Yeah. This is a new restaurant. Well, that's wonderful. Nancy, where have you been? And well, I have been missing for another space. Oh, Nancy. How can you do that? Tell me, how can you have a mini-plot. WFTL, are they still on the air? I just were telling you I was telling you, so it's not a table. I was going to call you. Really? That's my contact. Now, you didn't have that little kid there with him last night. Did he? He didn't, but I just thought he was. Oh, thank God. I just told you that negatively about him. This is interesting. Yeah. Why do we like to do that? You know, we like to have a little back and forth, you know? Especially when you have the listing audience that earnings got. You could have them in your living room and have room left over for the Russian army. What about the land? Oh, no, there is a winner. Uh, I'm inside the two of the Niel. Well, I'm doing real good now. And don't know you and Sunny about the two rock and ten instruments. Good recovery. Okay. When you sound real chipper today. Thank you. I'm looking forward to big day Saturday. I'm from Gravella. Oh, great. Are you going up there? No, are you here though? But you'll watch it on the TV. I'm a counter hit here of the best artist. Coach, how about? Well, who do you like in the, who do you like in the derby? Uh, I know who you are. Mr. Friske. I'm not going to do that. Right. I'm not going to pay very much, but I think he'll do it. Uh-huh. Well, maybe. I don't know. Is this something up to you? Yeah, it sure is. Okay. Nancy, nice talking. Okay, Nancy. I talk to you. How about that? Was that her name? Nancy. I hope, well, my mind is going. Anyway, Nick, how come Dave Johnson hasn't called us this year? Like he did last year before the derby. How, I got a nice Christmas card from day from New York from, by wherever. And the work, hearing the derby, although Nick thought it was last week. It is this Saturday at 506. Dave Johnson is the track announcer who will be calling the derby as he does. Every year for ABC. And I think, don't they? Simon Cast. Yeah, they Simon Cast the thing on radio and TV. So he'll be on home. Yeah. And he called us last year for like the two, three days before the derby and chat and Tom Durkin also. So maybe you can get a hold of him. Okay. So the speak. One thirty. Let's go look at those phones. Yeah, they are. They're all ended up in that. Take a picture of that right now. So wait a minute. Yesterday was asking about the Donnie Osmond pictures and all of a little people. Everybody's mode. Oh, the George's a photographer. And they're all like puking. And everybody, what happened? Did he get the ported or something? Where did he go? I guess it was Melvin was telling me. But you were in there and everybody's saying, God, what how do you know he's gone? It says, Jorge is long gone. But how do you know that? I understand that. But how do we know for sure? But he's such a groupie. If he was still around. He would have been, you know. He told you what. He told you what. Does that make sense? He told me. He was leaving. So we left out with my goddamn Donnie Osmond picture. He's probably in Salt Lake City, selling. Use douchebag. Never trusted guy who just got off a rubber boat. Okay, especially on South Beach. Okay, Wilton Manor's hello. Yeah, honey. I just dropped those photos all the way. And I thank you profusely. They, I don't know about the orange. But the red raspberry diet right is in safe. I think that's a dangerine. Oh, that's dangerine? Yeah. Well, we're going to start singing that. We're going to have Alex come back to second. I came down Larry Brentman. Yeah, banana river area. It's about the omitting decent stuff there. Delicious. And I thank you. And if we get on the stick with publics and when Dixie and a force him to carry it to stuff, it's good stuff. Hey, the question was, I go up there about every other week. She's my mother. She's not old enough to live down here. Right. Oh. Okay. I want to figure out which flavors you want to drag you something down. Hey, well, listen, these would be great. I mean, these, I don't know what other ones I got. I guess I'll have to watch ESPN every day and see what flavors they're advertising. Oh, strawberry, lemon leaves sort of thing that's. Yeah, anything. I like them all. You know, me, I'm easy. All right. Well, I appreciate it. Thank you. And say how to mom. Well, good. Bye. What a good guy. You know, he brought down four big two liter bottles of the flavored diet right. So it's red raspberry and tangy. We have a soft free sodium free camping free and sugar free. And unlike some of those real extreme diet sodas, they are not taste free. Yeah. No, this is really good. The red raspberry until delicious. I used to drink diet right all the time. It's good. Any kind of like a diabetic or on a real restricted diet or even like any of the diets. Weight watches, neutral system. They recommend if you're going to drink a lot of diets soda. Use diet right because it doesn't have the. Yeah, but be sodium. Yeah. Because you have a lot of sodium and you retain the water. You don't lose the weight. I'm not doing a plug for them, but I'm sure we get you are. Here's the call for Stan must be his broker. How does the sugar do it? That's okay. I just want I just not really force Stan. I just wanted to say hi and welcome back to the air. Have a heard you're a wild. Yeah, right. Do all night's sir and then the all next week. Really? Yeah. Your back sighting? Yeah, that is. That's great. Anyway, Neil. Yes, sir. Um, did you know that there is two Neil Roger shows on the air every day? 10 to 2 and 2 to 6. No, I'm sure it's tough. I'm just a little Joe. 10 to 2 here. Yes. Okay. And then 10 to 2 at night over on FPL. Who knows? Who's doing my show over there now? Oh, I'm dead. Oh, I'm dead. Oh, lie. He's very, I'm going to again. He's got everything. He's got the dying over here. Callers. He's got everything. That is off the fence of Neil Roger. What? What do they got to play one on FPL? My God. That must be ready to sign off. And get this Gilbert called last night. I'm sure that. And you know what he had to say? Is that a news bulletin? Well, this is an update. This is so smart me. You know what he wanted to know? He says, I'll bet you got a lot of spy reports about me. How many spy reports? Oh, no. No. No. No. No. No. No. I've never spoken to Paul Lyle. I've never seen him in my life. And he tells Craig Warden as a good friend of mine. Shortly after I've been a husband and a wife spoken to Craig. He says, Oh, no. Neil didn't have a stroke. I know the inside story. I just spoke to him. I've never spoken to the man of mine. He is the greatest BS artist in the hit. Since Steve came. Since Steve. I think he got even at the top. He's good. He's real good. I don't know if he's playing these things out of the out of the station. Or somebody's patching it through. Maybe you need to check whoever's on. On other words, he's recording our stuff off the air. I don't know. Maybe you need to check and see who's on duty on on IOD from 10 to 2. Somebody might have a phone patch over there. Yeah. Could be. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Can you do anything to know the Yankee games? That's for sure. Are you going to watch a game tonight, right? What game? Are you going to watch a baseball game? This afternoon. You know, if you get time. Can you listen to Paul Lyle tonight? I'm not going to explain something to you. Paul Lyle used to be here during these hours briefly. And he was so bad that he was replaced by Bill of Aquague, who was a board-off. Who had never done a, I'm not lying to you. Who had never done a talk show in his life. Well, that explains why he was also so bad. He was also so bad that he was replaced by the Dean. And when you were replaced by the Dean, that's like, you know, that would be like George Bush being replaced by William McKinley, you know. Well, he's doing pretty well. Right. Not be all the end. Considering that he's got five listeners who just call in alternately. You know, they take turns and call in and they disguise their voice. Well, I think I want the say to Paul Lyle. I'm dying out of the hand. Yeah, and I see that's what he's getting. He gets the, he's not somebody called in. The first time and he said, I'm dying over here, right? And he didn't do it right. So he says, now I may, I'm dying over here kind of sort. Do it right. And he let him call. This is the same guy who used to say on the ear. If it's the last thing I do, I'm getting Neil Rogers off the radio. And he's more than the most disgusting douchebag that are. Paul, you are such a win bag and so full of crap. And I hope you have a wonderful life over there with your 40 once at night in your six listeners. I mean, I'm a normal, even Norman Kent was ingenious in radio compared to that. Oh, he's off the air now. I know that he couldn't handle it anymore too much pressure with that big audience. You know who's taking his show to my dog. Just Paul Lyle. No. And also, you know who's taking his show. Sky. No. Me. You know who this is? Sky. Uh, control. I'm going to go all this time and I did not know this was Charles. What if you had some kind of a brain transplant? No. No, I'm the same person. I just, I know when to be to give you a spyre port. I'm going to give it a rest. That just, oh, God. What do you mean you're taking his place? I'm in there. You're going on the air? Well, the force. Oh, God. I mean, you'll have to be, you'll have to be sleeping later in the daytime like to least two. I can put Neil. I promise I won't do anything from your show. But see, that's the one thing I can give you. Oh, I think I'm running a real abstract. Oh, no. Have a great day. Okay, Neil. Good luck to you. All right. You'll need it. Thank you. Well, I'm 37. Oh, my God. Charles. That's his kid. He's going to be a talk host. Anybody in the audience like to be a talk show host? Huh? Anybody get the 711? God. Well, Nick wants to do a show. How about you do Saturday, 10 to 2? Anyway, because I like that yellow vision myself. I don't want to start ripping him. We can't talk about him. I would love to. God, what I love to rip him and ask is 23 till 2. And wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to rip it? You would like to. You loved the show. You hated the show. I liked everybody. You hated that show. You hated coming to here, setting up those chairs. Don't kid me. See, like, oh, Mr. Mr. innocent. You know this got that little angelic look on his face. Oh, I know nothing. I don't even know. We already know that. Anyway, 23 till 2 Gulf Stream. We can clearly see our sound. Oh, oh, are we gonna do now? Oh, wait. Oh, wait. Well, I can hear the smoke. Oh, I'm not feeling you want to hear that. Oh, I hope you hear it. Take a letter. Yes, Mr. Brown. I need 10 copies. 10 copies. Right away, Mr. Brown. Where? Where? Mama. Mama. Mama. Mama. What stuff is this? Hey, man. 141 in WIT. I figured if I can stay a day ahead of Rick and Puts. Then I'll be safe. Just keep cutting up no material and they'll never catch up. Miami. Miami. Neil. What is this? Congratulations to you, Neil. For. For a little strike at zero even with Colombian National Team yesterday. The night at the orange roll. Yes. Great game. All right. Hope we all enjoy it. And how about those cubs? What cup? Yeah. Mr. Mayor? Yes. Mr. Mayor, you are the moss and trotain and boys on the AM radio ever. Yes. Don't listen to this morons they call you. Exactly. Okay. I got a little trivia for you. You have a little one? Little trivia. Oh, I thought you said something person. Go ahead. What is it? It's way. Where do you sit? On 76. Where are you going? No way. Can you understand what he said? Mm-hmm. What is it? It weighs 160. No. No. 176. Yeah. 220 calories. A gram fat. 150 milligrams of you. 70-3 chocolate corn syrup. Sugar milk. Soybean oil. Butter. Salt. It's quite spicy. That's a candy bar. What kind? A Milky Way dark. Right. Oh, God. Find it at the Radisson by the airport. Great. Reap of 83 cents. I want to thank the staff around here for leaving me an empty box. Public sent over a box of Milky Way darks. And the empty box was left in my mail box. Well, that's good. It's worth it. Okay. Cut the crap. You're right. Well, it's a wonderful life. We meet you in May or we listen to you. Beyond tomorrow night and then most of the next week. We hope so. Okay. Bye-bye. The one thing I didn't check those is the hurricanes. Are they starting in the playoffs? Yeah. I don't think the players matter. Friety, I think. Let's see. Sometimes. I know it's this weekend. I'm not exactly sure which day it is, but that's coming up very soon. Oh, they may. I get the stadium down to either carry the hurricanes or the Yankees. There's no choice. Well, the point is when they're in the tournament. Obviously, we're going to carry the hurricane. Yeah. Somebody might be interested in that. 144. Now, what is that? Would I like to read the Dick Pertn letter? Nick? What is that about? Who wants me to read the Dick Pertn letter? Just a short note. It's not like a big somebody from Detroit. Oh, excuse me. Kathy asks Kathy who? Kathy's clown. Oh, yeah. Well, it says Neo Wild vacationing in my place on Marko Island last week in part of this week. I heard your return show and loved it. Incredible stuff. The Alex Bennett saga was better than fiction, best wishes for a full and speedy recovery. Dick Pertn. I've been wanting Mr. Pertn. Oh, dear. This is Mr. Rogers with another word for the day. Good morning, Mr. Rogers. And what is your word for today? My word for the day is lingerie. Mr. Rogers, I think the word you're talking about is lingerie. What? Get me. Get me. It's catcher to eye a choke-dub Mr. Munch. I know what it means. It means night gongs and sexy underwear. Yes. You know, it's Roger. I'm getting pretty sick of you coming up with disgusting words of the day. I mean, that's nothing wrong with that, but the way you do it, you know, one day you had fetish. Today you've got lingerie. Oh, dear neighbor. I think you've made a mistake. I said lingerie. You mispronounced it. I don't think so, neighbor. Let me use my word in a sentence. Okay, good. After we go shopping in Windsor, let's stop for a warm beverage. We don't have to go right back. We can linger. A. I see you, Rogers. I'm sorry. Sorry. I misunderstood your obvious good intention. Sure you do. And while we're lingering over our beverage, maybe we can talk one of the girls and do a table dance. Mr. Rogers, I think it goes to charity. Good. Bime is the Rogers. And you say, bones you are mone. Okay, one forty-six. One of the funniest people in the world, so to get that letter from Dick Perton, made my day in my weekend, I'm not so negative as I usually am in the pressing. Sunrise. Hi. Hi. Bale? Yes. You should have heard that. I searched him last night. Cool. Who is it? I'm coaching. Who's that? Oh, the guy with the socks in the toilet paper. Yeah. Well, last night he had a doctor of fishkin on, talking about, you shouldn't go fishing to hurt the swore little fish in water. That's a good subject. And then when he came. I bet you got hooked on that show. So to speak. And then he said, and if you want more information, called this number one eight hundred. So, what? What? What? What? Call that number. And he called her and he said, hey, you gave me this number to call. He said, get some like on a phone. He says, that was me or Roger. Oh, yeah, right? So everybody's called and number. And it's going to be your number. Oh, I don't think so. No, it's a matter of fact, there must be a follow-up because last week he did, he did a show on fish experiment. The toll free number was like 1-800-BASS-TURN. And I thought it was a pretty poor taste. He said, get them off. He said that already. Thinking, what? Why not? You can say bastard on the air. He's just scraping the bottom of the barrel. You know? He's still got that little preview button to squeaky kid out of them. That kid's sky. It sounds like he's going to fly away any second. Get somebody called him and fetch. He's tuning into like a little kid station over there. They got all these little, I mean, char-Charles is working there. Pretty soon. The kid that just called it a while ago is a 17-year-old kid, a groupie. Well, I'll tell you, pretty soon he'll be the manager. And they can call a show Charles and charge over there. It's going to be a good winner. That's a good winner. That's a good winner. Okay. You know, you keep well. I hear a lot of rumors about that place. I'm fine. Have a great day. I'm just saying hi to Ernie. You too. Okay. Give him a little a shaman because he could sure use it on that show. 148 at WI would be a little bit of pretty damn uplifting day. Little joy says hello. Sky was here. What did it job? Are you serious? What is he about? Like nine years old? Have you ever heard that? He makes I be babbling sound like the Connie Chung. I mean, it's just ridiculous. Miami. I don't know. Okay. Rhin's saying hi. On the 70's, you're happy we. Yeah. Are you format now? I'll be talking to you. This is the Ron Jr.'s nephew. We're going to have any. Ron is saying John the Tird. We know what you want. You want the Ohio X. What? Right. We're listening. He's even got it. Yeah. Why the hell was Ron saying John the T. By the way, Jr. I mean, this is the nephew. But where is the real? I'm really disappointed. What are you going through those carts in the rack for there, Riley? Or rather? Get your hands off our cramp. Okay. Get off our stuff. You can do whatever to have you want. We don't care. But cut those damn colors out. I'll tell you that. Or I'll do four hours. You guys tomorrow. I know you wish. Which one did I punch? Let me do that again. Miami. You. Aren't you lucky? Almost punched you out. Thirty minutes on hold and still. I don't know what that guy wants. Do you punch you out? Or was it just not your teeth on your goddamn throat? Yeah. I don't know. I'm talking to a Rico Riley here. I don't have any teeth. You don't? No. It's that one thing to say. I hear you give good gum though. Yeah. Lo me $50. So, what is that? Yeah. Okay. I'll be here early. There'll be a longer 205. Cooper City. No. Yes. How you doing? Are you going to take it? You got four hours to kill. Even if I'm a bogus guest today. I'm doing great. I feel pretty damn good today. It's good to hear you back. Is that the wrong thing to say? No. Where is all those pinheads man? Where are all those people at those loyal listeners that should be caught? Like Joe would six ends and Eric and Tim and this one. Where the hell are they? What the hell are they? They probably all in bed. With each other. I think so. Probably. Well, I'd pay to watch that. Yeah. Me too. I'll bet. What's the stand-to-one there? Stand is a small sentence. A disgusting elephant, uh, suppository cigars that he smokes. Hey, disgusting. Hey, Stan. I got one question for you. Yeah. What are they going to get rid of this lousy baseball? Exactly. What can I tell you? I mean, he doesn't want to answer the question. He's trying to stay on their good side. Little Lizzy realized that they lie a lot. Well, let's just clap in the maranol. Exactly. Slap that those two around the evil twins in there. Yeah. And I'm confident. What an asshole. Number one in our book. That's not all. Don't knock him. He sells my show. They's great. He is. He's the only salesman we got. Have a great life. You know what else? See, as they say, and he afternoon have a great life. Oh, excuse me. 15, or say, don't mess with me with those pseudo. You don't remember the call. I'm talking about from Carl Springs. He said he was your, um, contract man or something like that. You keep calling him contract man. You don't remember that call? They all play dead. Oh, man. He's been. He's got the, they've been a hundred. Correct syndrome. Man. He leaves a hero with a thing though because yeah. Yeah. He leaves a hundred and a half weeks and he already forgot them all. That's that's right. It took me 10 years to do that. I said. And the, I'll remember the card. I sent you four years ago from Delaware. I'm against serious. Okay. I can't remember what they'll happen to your yesterday, which is probably why I feel so good. Wild. I knew how to go. Okay. How come I punched you up? I don't know, but you did a good job. All these other people are waiting and waiting. And I punched you up. Cool. You'll see. No, I don't. Like I said, I had a few days with you. No, I don't. I'm not letting that go. Go bad. That's too bad. All of a sudden. You think let it go. No. No way. Are you nuts? Record a letter on the air. Yeah, I bet. I would like it on the air. I'd be like it. It may freely. I would let him in the show with that hairdo. Oh, yeah. I don't want to hear any more tacky or sick. Oh, okay. Just because he looks. You got like you got up the spaceship from your rain. It's not the bunny. Okay. What up? Puts. Heartland. Boy, how they hold every turn to the roof. Yeah, well, let's not dwell on the camera. This is what she said too. That was a great call. That's not. That's not hot find. That's what she said. He said, well, why not? Yeah. He's got to be the hornyest guy who's ever been on TV. Listen, she out did him last night. Anything that's moving, man. He wants to hop right on it. I'm telling you. Hey, I got a lot for the Derby. A lot for the perfect. Okay, Northern Wolfe. Mr. Surti and unbridled. On bridal, do you like? Yeah. He's got a shot. He's the one. At least you didn't pick Pad day any more. You're him out of there. Yeah. Get him back to the barn. Where you going, K. I'm feeling real good today. I feel a bit. I shouldn't say this because then I'll come back to home me. But the best today that I have of any day been back at the end of the show after the four hours. You know, not too bad. Like I could do another four hours. Yeah, I just heard about it. About what? About your stroke? Hey. But not my thing about my stroke. Well. Well. You know, right? Not in this case. Not that kind of stroke. Ha ha. Pretend we're talking about you. Come on. Yeah, I'm serious. Did you hear me read the letter I just got? No. I'm not a good person. It's semi-anice letter. I just read it on the air. He was over in Marco. He's got a place in Marco where he goes on vacation. He listens over there. He's a big fan of him. What did he say? He just said, you know, he was talking about them. They talk about your whole town of Florida. Nice. Well, you know, he didn't mention a name for a long time. And then about five minutes. Very good. Yeah. He just said he wrote you for a better. Yeah. I'm going to send him a note back. He's a great guy. And funny. Funny is how I mean, he just tremendous. Yeah. You bet. All right. Now you're funny too. Before I got so deep pressing in negative. What do you think about a Derby, don't you? I like Mr. Frisk. I don't, I'm not going to bet on it. Although I may go out there and say it today. I'm feeling pretty good. I may go out to colder with the bill. Who owns a track and just point out that stuff. I'm serious. I'm so excited. He's coming along. We'll go ahead and show him a few days when he gets courage. Walk on back. He's telling you when. Okay. All right. See you anytime. 158 in WIWD. How do you like that? He's even talking about me on here. I want to figure out a job up there. Oh, I hate you. Well, as well as going on around here. I probably got a week's worth of material. Yeah. Yeah. Because I came back and all this crazy stuff. I got stuff going on. And then that article in the paper and like Mr. the guy who disappeared as name we can't match. You know, I was telling him. He's the blame in me. I wasn't even here. And he called me on the phone in the hospital. He called me at home. I know we can't wait to hear back. We just have to have you back. All friendly, loving and wonderful. And then he goes in the paper and rips me. He's a one man station and he'll can't stand anybody's a threat to him. Well, that's your wouldn't include him. Anyway, what is that? Crock? What is that? Hello? Good day, Neil. Yes. I'm glad that you're feeling better. What is that CROC? I'm walking out on me. Oh, my god. If I didn't know that, I just said no or on the time. I've been trying. I wanted to. Well, when we knew he's people start calling in, then you know we really have done it. Go on the whole audience away. Anyway, I call up and I, because I know you would never let me treat it. Tell you that I listen and I'm glad that you're all right. Well, thank you, Crock. And by the way, hey, when you said faster, people would have to name him on faster. Really? As fast as when when reenaries go to picture of it around there somewhere, it's in it to him. Okay. Well, good day, mate. Okay, mate. See you. Hey. Okay. That's going to do it. Thank you. Stand stand will be on tomorrow night tomorrow night. And one of these nights soon on the day, most of the next week. We'll have an o'clock when I suddenly have the fourth stock that right before the notorious Larry King. Stay tuned for Rick and Puss. They've got a hell of a show lined up. They got all my carts out of the racks. It ought to be fantastic. And we'll see you tomorrow morning at 10 here on 610. Radio, Modlin. W-I-O-D. W-I-O-D. Stand stand, shooters of adolescent men. Brushed you by fellowmen walks. The only one up with condom, Jim Barton. We've been getting along well. Don't you think? Absolutely. We have a great time together. We're really compatible. Don't you think? Absolutely. We have a great time together. I love spending time with you. Do you like spending time with me? Let me say it a little slower. Absolutely. We have a great time together. That's why I need...
