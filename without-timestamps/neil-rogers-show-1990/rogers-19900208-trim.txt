for four hours and then everybody jumps on a bandwagon so i'm not gonna follow in those footsteps on this because i think it would be wrong of low-giver off the show entirely because i enjoy them and i just don't want to overdo it i mean he's here we were now he's just all over the place and uh... he even somebody even called him all was sitting here with rager sitting in this studio and mike was on a few minutes ago and called said the can't you get covered on with mike on he showed a marmorning that would be like having seen he come in tomorrow you know to do sugar cookies again and i don't i'm sorry but let's just let's just come back to reality okay man this market is pathetic it's like um... it's like somebody tells a joke on show a and it's funny and all of a sudden they're like ten other guys in a market telling the same joke i just uh... i'm sorry i don't get it so you know where you can uh... call or stop and every now and then it's like to peepie and pepper pines he comes like once a month or something or what's having two weeks and he's funny but we don't overdo it i hate when people drive stuff into the ground and what i heard yesterday afternoon i think we do have to get that guy or some cheesecake or whatever it is that he's squealing about because he just um... lost i think is the word getting lost somewhere in the shuffle nice guy i was for let's not i mean two days it was like jah my sick of that and you're never gonna hear that i think show and we don't and then all of a sudden yesterday's got the guy and her exploiting him and uh... broad that he had in here with him and some of the colors were really making fun of badly poorly and i thought i was in crappy taste and i think that uh... well listen that's such as my opinion okay as far as the other thing is concerned that there's a place to get into that after the break but i have about quite a bit to say about that i think the and i think the people from channel six all the way have no idea what they stuck around for four hours i guess they must have been amused by the show and they had a little a piece there on the sixty news last night but uh... four hours there must have been something else going on in town beside the bird you know for four hours yesterday that they could have been covering like lunch at the rascal house or anything anyway speaking of that like she seems to be enjoying those wings from wing really i'll ten fifteen and just a few more fifty and uh... what can i say it's interesting stuff going on anyway what was that gonna tell you all you have about yesterday i want to give you the story behind the story if of course you're interested we know this audience is too much into that kind of stuff but uh... let me get you a little background of what took place here yesterday it seems that when we made the offer to the bird to come on the show i think was on monday i had the knick called and within twenty seconds he respectfully declined and uh... cut a short and divine good luck to at that point he thought the story was going to be a real razor blade job because that's what he gave this Albert stir and the guy wrote the article for new times and reason i know that it's but of any denials that he might make is that stir and was here last Friday and read to me several lines or paragraphs from what uh... the board of told him during that interview with his house and i mean he called me everything under the sun it was a razor blade job now the reason it didn't come out in print like that is because basically the people in the times like me in a like the show in addition to which there's some people over there think he's a torpe okay and so it really kind of backfired and they turned around and it really was a lot different than he thought it was going to be and he even told fat rich which i know even over which is a trouble making anti-nobus is true he told me was very nervous and concerned about how the story was going to come out in print because he really had done a wicked i mean a vicious razor blade job so that's why he wasn't going to come in then the thing comes out he gets a whole of it uh... monday night or two denied and then he changes his game plan so now he shows up here yesterday and you saw the thing on six were they interviewed him outside i guess it must have been and um... his game plan was that he was going to come speaking in here is going to wait for us to start attacking him and after the first word he's going to come rushing in here to what's the big deal four days of bashing in the article is nothing what's all is just carry about and that was his game plan well it comes to find out that he was intercepted in the hallway by boy gerry and he said what are you doing here he said well i'm going to go in and uh... defend my son of a nice and no year not he said we invited you to come you turned it down and now you're just going to sneak in there and it's not going to happen so that was the reason they were you know i have to believe the premises because again he was doing it in the sneaky devious way instead of just to and i'm going to say something about that i don't i'm not going to say we're going to go into the Guinness Book of Records i don't know of any radio station in the history of this business that inspired somebody and then two months later invited him to come back to defend himself i never heard a such a thing i don't think it's ever happened before i could be wrong and if anybody knows of it please let me know but i don't think so i think it's a radio first in the history of the business it just doesn't happen you get fired you're gone you disappear you know that we talk about it all the time you're gone and i said oh well he went to seek uh... better opportunities and you know whatever and that's a way to business works so here's a guy who we were going to get four hours voluntarily who was then going to be devious kind of sit back waiting to see the lay of the land and how the article came out and i want to wasn't quite so bad then he's been coming here and try to stop pedal it and be mr nice guy i really think it was like sucking around for his job back a little bit i could be wrong and to come to find out when you left here he thought uh... that it didn't a lot of good like there's going to be counting on his door a knockin a down the offer in jobs nobody's been doing that for two months and certainly after that pathetic performance yesterday it isn't going to happen now and some of you i mean i thought everybody have their say yesterday there were a couple of mediritated me because they just were looking for trouble that was obvious but i mean some of you but birdlickers it just cannot stop like that one young human guy man he said that same thing so many times uh... since the summer that it just he must have it in blazing in his brain and he called yesterday for pity and did you say and these exact words did you tell him this i got those for your pal mind you all got them business okay don't have those hooks for the car in here and tell me what i should do and how i should have said it i mean it is life this is real life this is reality and that's what mr. burberry's got to grow up in a phase he's got to work he's got to work in crying over still milk is going to get the job done did he make himself look better yesterday now and himself look like a jerk and whatever respect i may have had for him at all as of last December when we parted company i mean by now it's gone it's completely gone because his behavior is been just pathetic and he goes through this big song to dance about well when we left here he wanted to see other people and do that which is fine because i feel the same way then why was he belly aching any article about well i thought we could be friends and maybe go to the track why would i associate with a now that i fired him but i didn't associate with him when he was here we're working together okay doesn't make any sense none of it makes any sense but it was pathetic it was the meaning it was just the tragic but i'm glad that we did it i'm glad we went through the exercise because now he's got to know more so our grapes he had his opportunity to give money a chance to say his piece and quite frankly when i put him on when he was just thinking around in the newsbook i wasn't really sure whether they were very upset you know if i did put him on there we're going to have a nervous break down because they were not happy he was in the building out of those circumstances i'm talking about of course management so that was uh that was the real story behind the story okay and the way all of this went down yesterday oh wild Gilbert report oh that ought to be exciting do what i mean it's just it's like and of course part of it is Gilbert's fault too because he's out of control he's going every show in town now because he's been exploited to the point now he feels like he's just out of control and i'm not ripping him by saying that but i'm just telling you Gilbert that it's just getting to be a little much what is it say Gilbert wouldn't leave but i got news for you it's it's not the point the point is that people i mean if you want to sit in the audience and cackle a little bit that was one thing but the brutal i mean the way he was the brutalized yesterday was unconscionable really was i mean or people i heard a lot of it and people making fun of them alas wanted to believe well i you know come right out and say Gilbert it's time to go audio is goodbye that would have been the way i would have done it okay but like i said i'm a little curious why i got on Tuesday who is adamant that there was just too much silver to me was sick of it it was not the advice was asking if you could borrow for a few minutes yesterday i did i just don't understand that i'm sure alas will clarify for us when he comes in the day uh 21 past 10 and wio did we want to tell you about a reno we're at the world famous cafe bar fair we replaced one of the patron fresh ground coffee with soldier's cripple let's see if you notice a room good copy it i can't have the creamer we replaced the creamer with ground up chalk let's see if you notice uh can you pass the sugar we replaced the sugar with ground up freeze dried white mice let's see if you notice i wonder if i'll notice what we replaced the lemon with okay it's uh 26th it's 10 at wio day it's something with us overhead today let's take some call jio okay because i've already said enough here's a foul wild Gilbert report gone okay good style like when you go to that first call and they're gone let me tell you something okay i had some stuff that i wanted to say this morning and it's used me for taking your valuable time for saying it okay whoever the hell that was anybody was looking to pull out anyway how smart can maybe uh for water bill yes i heard uh no as a show that it's toppled uh Gilbert might be taking over the show yeah right i mean i'm ready to throw myself out i'm brow at boar water that happens sir just a joke okay okay just a little joke okay i got uh i was i had a good time yesterday was in the show was ready to bang but um it was pathetic what's that it wasn't that i mean it was also the tan is entertaining but it was pathetic tragic well i want to tell you something that was more tragic and made out of the entertaining but uh i wanted a city of tempered pine city meaning last night and uh you had to you had to see them uh arguing over what are not to reduce the price of a hole from 500 to 300 and how they were going to the simple math on what the at actual course of running on a hole or took about 15 minutes i mean it was just uh all sounds pretty pathetic and we thank you so much 28 after ten and w i think come on cut the crap will you cut the crap up tempered pine speak to the devil yeah new high you know okay i listen just a couple of comments from which you've been talking about uh yes today i have to be driving i caught a little bit of hours event and that really was a terrible job what they were doing on bill yeah it was uh horrendous anxiously really and that uh and then we did the joey did the same thing and of course bill worked there's just having a good time he doesn't realize it but and i'm not trying to be holy here the now but there are some of us i think bill knows how to do it and i think i've done at least i've tried to have fun with bill as opposed to just the massacoring him and uh making uh uh my mockery of him which is a lot of what i heard yesterday was awful yeah i think he was just trying to impress that uh barric brody had on work although that's turned into a riff Alex they all don't know why not but uh yeah we don't have to do that but i just i just find it very bizarre that i'm too busy he was totally bird i would go break it we just gusted and fed up and he did have a very valid point i mean it's getting ridiculous and then all of a sudden yesterday it turns around into a four hour uh uh marathon you know what the meal yeah one other thing i hope this bird thing is it totally put the bed now it's uh i mean yeah i'm not saying we're not going to talk about it but as far as him he he comes in here again he'd be wasting the gas to come here okay he's had his last gas fun this show yeah because the only uh to summarize the summary that i get out of it is that uh he's nothing but a uh women how and with really mal tackling moly lemon to have a great day so i'm just gusted with him i really am and you know finally i tried to be reasonable i really did and i better were backward to be reasonable and a lot people you know were sympathetic to it him the call and have a lot of time because i didn't want to become well see i told you if i came in here would get a chance to say and i i gave him all the opportunity in the world and i kept giving him all this extra time to think of all these reasons and the only thing had to say was would not he's working for you well nobody held a gun to was dead and forced him to come in and tackle any of those females everything okay nobody forced him to do it in fact uh when you look back on it if it was so difficult then maybe i did him a big favor because it was such a pain in he as working with me but she's to come in and for four hours you know wine and and so finally i lost my cool with one point so me you may have heard it and i really wasted it when i said haven't you been listening don't doesn't anything penetrate your ears don't you get the message i'm gonna sit here and i'm gonna talk about whatever i want to talk about and it's my show and i'm not gonna put up with temper tantrums and the people in the building don't want to put up with your with your rotten temper and your nasty disposition and that's it you're gone oh oh like all of a sudden you can see that little jeeie light bulb lighting up over his uh head you know over his dome now he really makes me nauseous okay i hope he and johnny dark have a wonderful life together and they can run around writing letters to everybody else in the industry telling how none of us know anything and they know it all and it's a different set of it and maybe someday one or both of them will get a job my any yeah yeah i do okay first off i like to say hen thundered up the burn i don't even know what you had in the first one you know it's interesting even some of the people who are defending and yesterday are saying that they missed him and they said but we got to admit the show is a little better when i'm boy he kept the all been out of shape about that yeah it's like ten times better i don't even know how you had him on the first place excellent point a moron he should well not not let's not say a moron just a cackling idiot well more on quote for on his crash yeah tackling idiot has a little clear yeah um you tend to better so i wanted to say and good luck thank you said that's well ended okay a little uh little minor stuff there it's 1031 a W.I.O.D we have an opening in date counting now if you move very fast it's got to like the post more than i also the thing about Gilbert is very i'm not kidding around about that i'm just as stressed with with this this to me it like it minimizes the entire market and like i said before Gilbert has to take a lot of the blame for the i heard he call Larry King last night and was doing a lonely fifty dollars routine i didn't hear it myself but i heard a little spy report and i mean Gilbert you just you can't you can't be like com hangs you know you can't do 800 movies all in the same week there are only a few people who can do that like comalli ringworm but um not still you know if you want to come in once in a great while to want to call once in a while if you can get true you know he's always tell me can't get true i have no problem with that i'm not going to blow them off but i'm going to try to slow put the brakes on little bit because it's getting ridiculous just it also speak of ridiculous did you hear what stand set on a promo about how you to i didn't hear a show i studied took the poll and theory meriman beaches of her name is i got news for your man it's no wonder we have so many optometrist in this town and don't tell me that i don't know a beautiful looking woman what i see one because i do and theory meriman is not to exciting okay i mean jesus for nandes has got better looks on her fingernails than the theory meriman and her whole body and it's not even a contest what are you guys looking at are you nuts or you really need some serious health it's the 1033 and w i of d to y i'm dying on the head that's you i'm out to 1036 and w i of d bokeh i am now yes sir i thought we was going to play in a new uh... a q to yesterday have a new part i thought we're going to have a new egg sugar yesterday meaning what i think uh... that you're pretty light on it yeah intentionally i don't want them delicate about the fact that when he came in we didn't get a chance uh... uh... yes listen to a couple of i and that that's the pretty slow yeah well just like this call let's go to a call this by reported my name hello how you doing the uh... where's it highly uh... well whichever uh... it's put on the border line you know i got to get out my border path to go across the street right on the cutting in yeah written uh... you're better this morning in a blue gill but off-pour not the car show anymore i just say that little one of them i didn't hear you i've been out of the vehicle on the and uh... and i know that is uh... yeah i got a uh... a good way for you to uh... studios guys with your satellite situation where right to let it explain how you can legally do it and uh... federal government will back you on it with that right i will uh... right to let it put a little information packet in there today instead of the call and we'll be right out here okay thank you ever good day you two ten thirty seven w i o d camera mail yeah i got to tell you i haven't heard anything or anything like yesterday shows since jinn and tami were on nightline yeah i mean one of the side benefit one of the side benefits of yesterday show from the person we're speaking was that uh... i finally realized i wasn't the only person i've got treated like a piece of crap at one of the personal parents is there uh... i was well i mean there was a lot of conversation about that and there's no question that that's true but that isn't a region of fire never i look i could if i wanted to be really vicious which i wasn't because uh... that would only played into his hand but if i wanted to really lay it on the line there are dozens of things that he did yeah like uh... like the time that stand and i wanted to kind of resurrect our little thing of the ice cream store and all of the sunday comes up with this talk and he started doing this repeatedly when we had the tami had a remote or no matter what he had some excuse that he would fabricate so is not to go along with the game plan and all i mean we'd go to be up and brought anyway so he set up this deal with his real estate person and he did that after we had already set the date up to do this appearance you know and i i just got sick of that i mean it was one of many things here he was getting basically a free ride here and yet in each time we expected him or i said do anything i got the important stuff to do okay they can't wait for another day i mean there are dozens of reasons i just got that up with his entire attitude it's stuff and that it's such and the idea that he comes barging in here two months after he got his ass cam is it for well my side of the story you're what side you're fired you stump you are paying the ass i got tired of you you're gone that's it grow up and accept it you know he can't do that even now he can't accept it i'm sure now let's be seen as done can i play amateur psychologists here oh sure yeah we need we did we have a void here in our lineup we need to you know a word pop to the mind mind about plan after in great immaturity i'm listening four hours to the test and i'm glad you made back a little yesterday and legend you know given to it's playing out this guy wanted to admit anything despite your repeated conversations with him over the months he would not adjust his behavior it's just evident to me that the job wasn't that important to him you know well when i finally started screaming at him he said well i got to do that on my own personal i said fine then there's the reason you can't do that that's why he can't be on the show oh is it all of a sudden that terrified it for you know yeah one last thing now it's i thought also he was talking around for his job yesterday because i i saw this he's not a talent because he didn't get picked up right away after he got fired and i you know i don't know whether or not he is going to get hired by state but this reveals and this is the thing that frightens me this reveals that he really in his own mind thinks that he could go on like one of his certificates because oh yeah would be great event w s put you on right off as the deal tend to too and then you know then it would really have something he believes that he believes he can go on and do a four hour talk show every day and carry it and the fact is that you know the last time i was a vacation most people said he need a good job but that was out of the ordinary in fact the time before that he had filled in he had embarrassed himself so much that man fact that's how Alex spent it gone here yeah okay if a word for the bad job he did filling in the previous time Alex would never have been in his building yeah so Alex was in a little gratitude there too well i hate to say but i'm enjoying all this well of course that's what this time market solid about okay have a great day now too but i buddy loves a lot of bickering and a hate etc why you're looking at the food like what is that i think the Toby's bringing food from the toast today i think that's the rumor what are you looking for melden put the home who dropped a cart standard well tell them to get off his lazy eyes and go back there and find it and don't let them go around with the show time to get off his show okay we're doing a radio show here we're not playing stand made your boss and found got anybody would do a pull and have his audience vote for Terry Merrimon over just help her and is ought to be ashamed i think that i think stand-worked you know he doesn't like to admit it but still back in that Philadelphia thing with Terry Merrimon and all those Philadelphia Twinkies that you want to do hello hi there how are you okay hold on a second what the what part are you looking for he dropped an arrow what's the hell you're playing my cart you slime ball and those right there thank you with a whip get out of here saying go get some material with it let's uh how could that be tamarack i just thought well listen it's so bizarre now we might as well put you on right now right hi i hit of all these other people right but i i'm not about it too you're a good man i just called up 976 roads because you said it was a good thing to do it is beautiful well i'm having a dozen i'm having a dozen sent a share for her i pray that it's a birthday what a what a way to sell it is tremendous have two dozen sons and two does sure i'm sending send a bill your phone i think i got all the money in the world i was driving home last night from my health club listening to stand on the radio talking about uh you're that thing with you tell and the other one very man i couldn't figure out why he was doing it and he was in that mouth to do and now when you're in a specific and i'm staying i call him oh well he does have nothing else to do it's a good time color time as sand is one of the great time colors and his bearded business and it's a good way to kill some time you also says he's got cut beyond it you all he must not have too much confidence and so well first of all let me say this he has accepted it as a temporary thing okay but why he continues to dwell on that on the air i don't know i'm telling him every day cut the crap cut the crap now just go in and do it sit there during the ball game have a free meal relax uh you know and he just did it's compil i don't know what the hell of story is i take a subject for it i know be a hard dog he worked with Glenn for a while maybe a rough dog what about baseball we're not gonna have baseball down here to hear well not there any time soon i don't think oh what a bomber now can't do with that oh well let's keep us fingers crossed maybe there was dog but you know let's hope let's learn Georgia show yesterday with the bird i thought you were real man you held with the court and we got everything pretty much straight now real man well why you could have never said that you know but you're a nice guy yeah sure anyway i get back to work you have a good day certainly good okay boy they're really sucking around this morning 1044 at WOD how about those maple leaves man watch that game i said they kicked their crap out of saying Lewis seven to one Allen vester actually put a good game in goal and ally afraid he was to go and nuts in the um a little france is steady was just a granite nobody cares anymore about hockey but i just have to watch it was great and to writers only two points out of first place in the north division who can believe that uh let's bring the bird back and talk hockey okay sunrise real i do and great couple comments um that sounds like a real good idea to bring them back to talk about hockey yeah well uses head is the puck uh i just have one word for yesterday not for the show the show is great but the keyword for yesterday i think it's just pathetic that's that's the word that keeps rolling around my head you met it you've met in that word already ready to get bad you and to talk about uh my uh the great deal but anyway he he was been calling around sports talks a few years now yeah you know he used to call it chappin and i think bill is the first non-sports talk show that he's called yeah i never heard of him before until i heard about bill show one day yeah i had to go and then all of a sudden he started um just like multiplying i think we have about a half a dozen gobret's not there but there's a thing you've disappointed you bring out to a serious kind of serious about bill burden that fine line you know yeah uh it's like when it's like you know when you have at him it's like half of it's because he is funny and you know maybe like the other half because you're like you know you make him fun of you know i mean no for like you know i'm not making fun of mine no i'm not saying you i'm fighting funny and i find him amusing because he's got a good he knows that he's a little different and he knows that he's uh bizarre and he's funny and he's having a great time with it but i don't think he knows when he's being exploited and what people are just making fun of of him and that's what happened here yesterday after me i don't give it to anybody says or anybody denies it i heard it i heard a lot of it yeah or like i cringe i really cringe because a lot of the call is also the comedian who thought she was so funny i choose about his funny is a wet dish right she had nothing to say and then basically it turned into the Gilbert children because she offered not she had nothing to the show yeah they got pretty lame there towards the end now except they happened to i think for a pizza number for a new system i mean that's pretty original yeah it was pretty lame now why does that have to go on why can't these guys doing their own thing here's a guy who's been in the business for many many years he's working in the york in San Francisco all over the country what is it in disease that these people catch when they come here that anything that they hear especially on this show but not exclusive on this show all of a sudden they all start doing it i don't get it i just don't get it i don't get it i even you know i was lost a lot of credibility yesterday when he did that to me well maybe if he finds his um maybe whatever the hell he's looking pity that's way that oh no you see we decide we can't say that anymore hop she's cake which is really an always guys oh yo you're hoping it's Jerry she's gank ah oh is that it oh it's getting like sandbox time here at the sandbox at the oldies i'm sure glad i got these CFL M2 jingles carded up people in the audience don't even remember wmw they haven't been here long enough 153 wd Rogers

there oh it's your opinion kiddo yeah you've got a cry of anyway we love it yeah but that's not the point i'm not knocking Gilbert the point is that there are people who are he's just it's overdone no

cello hello yes sir uh i was it's that little Rogers yes my honor because the other day uh i called and called and called and nobody told me how long would it take to be put you on right now sir whether than wasting my hey the rush is here time right a year ago hashing the ancient past i year ago this is it a year ago yes i a year ago i called the station yeah and i i i i complained that the bird was or nothing more than a wrapping hyena and i i just assumed that the station was written but written it now i was told this specifically yes that management felt that this was a good combination period then what do you expect them to tell you well what did i expect them to say well right now be wait a minute you expect them to say yeah you're right now be god tomorrow because you're called now i'm a good night that's just one little male and the car but the other thing is i'm feeling possible for the people who will review it if you are sure yes that's why he's gone well

following remark i think you're going to warn you got a good head i guess you are not looking for more no what is not going to be like yeah you did something when Gilbert was on that i re-exem it because it's similar to the Joan River's remark that was made about tencent headborne is on a diet she takes it off when she had that problem you made a remark about Bob Kuzzi now if you want to be two that's one thing but i don't believe in attacking a person who can't hurt and her let me say this to i'm not attacking him because he's got a speech thief that he shouldn't be a broadcast hero k bob kuzzi if you have a whoever heard of making somebody who's got a speech thief back into a rucksack for barba walters in tom brocaster cut the crap it's eleven o' way to wav in and i hear that the alice was giving speech lessons to Gilbert yes i didn't hear that part but if i would have heard it i'd probably put my fist through the radio i mean just uh pathetic Alex come on let's go back to be

checker and bulk are going i just wanted to get something to do that with that power of sight meant the only word i can lemming uh... i said what i said you said what you said melon had whatever and you should have known it you should have known it when you're in Chicago because you showed that you did from there by yourself with uh... with so fantastic because that time i finally realized what it was that asshole was not here with you did you hear that alibi gave yesterday about why he didn't go up there now that was the lamest excuse the world you know all we talk about was the cubs and he wasn't going to be about like he could pick and choose his spots okay in other words if it wasn't something that he was interested in he wasn't going to be bothered you know like with a free trip to Chicago and we stayed in the rich couple which to me is one of the finest hotels in the world don't miss a kill it in jibbael that's another story but i mean the food was fabulous even have to go to the ball games that there were a lot of people along any on to rise you went through on way like melvin and went out and got bombed and to had a good time thousand did that all melvin had a great time up there he didn't want to come back uh... i don't remember i tell him the story every morning we'd get up and go out to breakfast at seven thirty he'd be just coming in from the night before i i

we could probably run uh... both transmitters for us in g tr by the way spike wise looks if he this morning he was downstairs with his cowboy hat and his skirt kickin uh... uh... out fit he's got a course off to it later and those two i just can't believe it because w x i a and it landed with some of his do see on a satellite um... f two twelve by the way but anyway they were a lot of spots for

steakings coming in a couple minutes every day before you show me i don't have a problem but i want to say it again why isn't anybody responding to this are they all death don't you remember right when he came in on two day and i'll maybe he didn't do it on i don't do it but it was at the beginning of his show and he said it's a Gilbert free to he must have said this thirty times to the altering the show it's a Gilbert free to the and i'm also going to be the government for you wednesday and every day i'm not just going to be Gilbert free because it's out of control between neo and this one and even stands talking about it's just and he's right he had a very valid point it's just getting out of control then he comes on yesterday and he's going to have my pertinent and the it turns into a uh... on nightmare i don't get it right well let me remind you something why you talk to boy Gary what the hell do they want talk to boy Gary about Jimmy Gilbert maybe half of what the bird made and put him on your show no about twenty five grand a year no i don't i work alone sir you're a lot of fun one by the week one once in a while i don't like to be predictable once in a while once in a while we'll be you'll be right we like to become a good call once in a while okay all right yeah right i think it is something about the clock today or is it i don't i don't get there where is this time come from i sure hope it's not connected to the atomic clock because otherwise the whole world is a big trouble i can just see the queen standing out there looking at big band right now or at prince Charles for they had a thing about uh... i don't know is entertainment tonight or one of those last night about the prince Charles and Diana he is so me as i mean honest to god that man that child whatever he is i'm not sure what category he fits into but he is so ugly and scrawny and his ears are bigger than his body he looks like dumbel on a bad day and he was in a bathing suit and he's got like the ugliest the most hideous body as well as almost as ugly as his face and uh... i'd thus british with that royal they've just got to be something done about that okay they're just like the bird they don't know they lost the war okay nobody ever told them that they lost the war and they just uh... don't know what the hell is going on those british we're probably get a call about that swan those queen worshippers anyway in standas looking at my watch it's eleven fifty a w i o d d okay it's fifty one thirty three i've never been a fix it what the hell happened the clock on the wall and then we have a little clock on our board here and it's so they both say fifty one thirty three and they're just stuck in suspended animation wonder if there's something significant about that maybe that's a code here's a pember fine till oh with a draw on hands portion nipples uh... neo this year the cardered birthday party the night but uh... we are all so many of these strange products by the guy with the eyes yeah we're talking to him and get the view of friend of you're other buddy can block don't know that i don't know that yeah we're not about a riddle of a feather you can't catch a nice guy and how he loves to go in so much yeah you screwed go in so yeah i don't know he's a one a came up to the track that they're highly an a i haven't thrown out he's a story and how you're so you know he was he was just fun with you know he wasn't fun with anybody stand in behind the babbling to nobody i mean there is nobody there and he's standing way behind me well which is the bird was uncomfortable and he's got his other goofball and hangs out with him is Alex and i'm telling you it's amazing when guys get to be that age and they have nothing better to do it so it's like sandbox time you know it's on better way way last time i'm a way to class and i clicked in our research and showed just before so well you're covering all the bases now what can i do now and uh get

ever encountered in the business it no wonder that the steve is the one that found him and from the day that he came in his building he was looking to make trouble that's his that seems to be his main goal in life he's a man of five well good good luck to him all the way last last one really really he was what he was really risen to his own level now at fdl i would have to talk to his uh you know

didn't stand like me yeah you know he doesn't okay no he's a little whiny than i am i'm poverty speaking up here i got to hang up okay see if it's twenty one two a wio days got nothing to do with him being like me it's just got to do what he's got to learn a lay of the land so to speak the lay of the land which is what he's looking for here's the not landing lady hi you well you want before yes i'm very sorry i was getting emotionally distraught carried away and i a shiny i guess that's okay you know when i found out we're gonna be related really we made it by me what do you mean my brother fiaxane her aunt is your landlord are you serious isn't that great your brothers fiaxane's aunt that's it is my landlord my landlord lady you're landing in California right well they're nice people

fascinating and all of a sudden the last couple days my neighbors are so friendly it's uh this is just really just all walking their dog hey how you doing you are the ones they caught sure like to see that Ferrari uh finally moved from over there for just a you know and see they came to wash the car yeah well those are not some big improvement i'm not complaining at least they're speaking that's a good start that's true that's true so not planning we're going to hope it's good tonight well we know that Michael and the old senator there who i'm getting so tired of i could vomit um we know that

our fingers back he has a lot of visit Donna Mills yeah i think that idea did you hear the thing that next season there's a Michelle he's last year is it um that story is wrong and so i'm Michael
