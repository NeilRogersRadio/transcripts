You said this few minutes ago that you are a little psychotic today. Yeah. How psychotic? Because I'm listening to this and that. Do you people that are calling in seem to know you quite well? Yeah. Well, that's because they're crazy as I am. Uh huh. So this is the way your show usually goes. Well, I mean, there's no like predictable pattern. What does that mean? In other words, you expect this the first time you've heard the show? Yes, sir. And you expect to listen one day and you like have your finger on it? Well, that's why I'm asking. That's why I was asking. Well, it's hard to say. This is a very bizarre, very volatile town. It goes whichever way the wind is blowing. Just like the football fans here. Uh huh. Well, I am a dolphin fan. But I have to tell you my legions goes with the Eagles. I'm understanding. Well, we understand that and we'll kick the crap out of them. But, uh, you probably will. You right. Well, they're a little erratic. Okay. I think they would be the kindest word I could use unpredictable erratic. Well, it seems to me they've got the talent. They just can't come to you. Oh, I will say this unless we have a better pass rush against the Eagles. And we head against the Raiders. Randall Cunningham is going to run us out of the ground. He will start his dangerous. He's dangerous. I didn't see any pass rush to the dolphin. No. We're going to injure him in the first quarter and give his ass out of the game. Uh huh. Thank you very much. All right. Well, it was a very interesting morning. I've had listening to you. Because we won't even have less than an hour and already you're kind of like trying to analyze the uh program and I think you have to get a little more time. I'll give you listen to Howard Stern for five minutes. You wouldn't get the drift of it. That's true. You would get the forwards, but that would be about it. All right. Well, I wish you a happy holiday. And the same to you. And take good care. Okay. And don't be too abusive to the kids. They don't know any. Exactly. After we beat him up, we'll clean him off and put him back in school again. Okay. See you. All right. Give him a little bath. Feed him to the dolphins.

If I had a dollar for every bad mobile phone we got in this town, I could retire. I can go in the desert myself. Does he gone? Look at that. Not only the phone was so bad, it did one of those immediate disconnect. Sorry. Was it us, sir? Was your crappy phone? Sorry about that. Anybody who knows that guy by a man who's cellular phone for a Hanukkah or Christmas or a poor or something. Okay. That was pathetic. We get all whole bunch of those. And they start out immediately. They're already crackling and puking and like Marconi is rolling in his grave. And then like after three, where the middle of a sentence. Look. Just like happened in Ted Bundy. Hollywood. Deal. Yes, sir. There's no longer Hollywood. Well, what do means no longer Hollywood? It's little quick back. Yeah. I'm boxing on each side now. We. Uh, hey. We, eh. They got one on each side of me now.

Yeah. You know what the mean? I don't like that one is what I like the one where the guy is singing. You know, it has a little more schmaltes to it. With that organ. Watch what he does with the tune. Okay. Now they were all on the backyard with the baby suits. Six sizes, too small on the stomach. 40 sizes too big. I want to know one thing. Are there any French Canadians who are under the age of 100 and look on a scale of 10 better than a minus 200? I mean they are just so old and grow task and keep and disgusting. They're driving reverse. You all make a sick. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. They went away. Now. They went into where my niece. Uh, she's a waitress, right? Yeah. $48 bill. You know what they left? $50. $50. $50. $50. $50. $50. $50. Yeah. So now here's the best part is when you ask him something, they don't speak English. Yeah. But when they want something. All they knew is we. They speak real good English. You're in the lead or I love those French. By the way, I want to take something back. Now I put words in Henry Burrow's mouth yesterday about the late great restaurant critic Peter Clayton. And I got to admit. Not seriously. No Henry used to hang out with him in all those free wine tastings and all he said Peter really knew is crap. That's what he said. Oh, I can. Now seriously, that's what Henry said. Uh, one other thing for I go. Yeah. Uh, up the poppin'o. I put them guys on the fourth floor. I want you to get them guys just in a check. You know, the ones that leave the bartender $50. $50. Listen to me, sir. I am trying desperately to get the people at poppin'o park anybody to come up with some cash. This is a really good one. So, I'm going to take a look at the next one. Okay. Okay.

He said the 73,000 people are just cried over to see the dolphins lose. He said it. Well, the epipenter. He can call people names. He said it. I am very upset about the way he's been talking about the dolphins, but this past Monday when I went to the game as the tailgate party, I had the chance to have a TV radio with me. So I listened to ABC instead of having to put up with Rick Weaver. Mm-hmm. Well, he sure took a lot of heat this season. Hello? You know, the guys got problems with him.

I saw the morning, I saw the night, I saw the lefteers. I saw the night, That's the morning, thousand minutes old. It turned out so crumbling. Just a second, he'd pull his ass off on the rain. Well, people are starving, right, Sandy? Right, Mayor Sandy. We got a whole cheese pie here, here. They know that he's even touched yet and a half of a pepperoni from Jeff. You guys are picking out over there. There are some white hots and some hot sauce and a whole bunch of eggplant parmesan and a couple of garlic rolls left. How was your turkey yesterday? It was outstanding. Your mom and I, my mom of course, got an empire kosher turkey, the best. Oh great. And made this incredible herbal, herbal, almond stuffing. Great cranberries. Well, I got to find out from her what kind of crunch you buy in the store. Is that like frozen sandy? What? When you get cranberries? I think so. Are you coming to can? No, I'm not talking about. Oh, yeah, even the mashed up kind coming to can too. They're all canned. Are they? Yeah, are they? Oh, these were incredible. Yeah. What? I don't want people to start to talk and say I'm totally chronic, but I have a reason for calling to say. Sandy, you can call any, you can call any day you want because you are celebrities, you are stars, we can have voted you. It's almost like with Laura converting. Thank you. Well, listen, my brother-in-law, he's in town today. Okay, he's leaving Monday, so he's listening to you today because I'm making him. Yeah, and what does he say so far? Well, his name is Ernie, and he likes these canes. Oh, no! And I'm making him. Yeah. So I told him, you had to listen to Neil today. No Steve came first while you can't get it in date because he need a proper toaster, which we don't have. Exactly. Maybe he's got a pacemaker. You could stick his thing in there if I work. That's right. And second, I told him my promise to him, I was going to call him a douchebag. Grilled on the radio. What a slime ball. So this one goes out to my brother-in-law. Yeah. So Neil, that's what I really call for today. Tell him to put it in his pipe and smoke it. I will. I was Corrigo, and Corrigo just assumed up out of that chair and took off like a bad in heat. Well, you're doing it Neil, you're number one. We are doing a sandy and you're number one and one half. And Bobby is one and three quarters. Bobby's a turkey he's working today. Really? Yeah, I got today off. So I'm not risking my job today if I call you. Well, you're a great American. Sandy, have a wonderful weekend and kick your, what is your brother-in-law? Brother-in-law, brother-in-law. Kick his ass out of there. I will. Stick him out in the middle of the high 75. We'll speed it up on the way home. Oh, right. I have a great day. Love you. Bye. Well, markets up 10 points. The food is fantastic from Wayne Arnold at Arnold's Royal Castle at 125th and Northwest 7th Avenue right off the 125th Street exit of I-95. And the pizza loft in Jeff Cohen, one of the great Americans in history who blew all that money on that stupid stuff on the game. You've got to go to pizza loft this weekend and help him make that money back. So we'll have plenty of money to buy a Hanukkah gift. Okay, like for me. Well, I have a lot of stuff 15. Or W-I-O-D, where the food best continues. Boy, I haven't eaten that much. I have. Do I have? I had eggplant. I had four Nile burgers. Four. Well, that's not much. Two slices of pizza and then a little sliver. Ah, that's it. I'm finished for today. Okay, that's it for me. All right, well, say the White House for suds. What do I got to- Oh, look at that. Two big ones. We're up to our long-distance dedication. And this one is about kids and pets and the situation that we can all understand, whether we have kids or pets or neither. It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio. And here's what he likes. Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it. Recently there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named Snuckles. But he was most certainly a part of us comes to again. From coming out of the record. Play the record, okay? Please. See, when you come out of those up-tempo, damn numbers, man. It's impossible to make those transitions. And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know, they do this to me all the time. I don't know what they'll do it for, but damn it. If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it. He's down on the phone. Okay, I want to damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication. Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. It's a god-less, damn time. I want somebody who's just f***ing brain to not come out of a damn record that is, that's up-tempo, and I gotta talk about a f***ing door dying. Plus, it's imponderous, man. Ponderous, imponderous. Oh, Zenfabi, it's all she can. Can't fit in the bell of the van. So, Rose and Barbie doll looks and acts just like the TV pig. Just pull her strand of spaghetti. And there you go, and I have something I never have now found ever, ever. And look what happens when you press your little fat belly. The Rose and Barbie eats all she can. Can't fit in the bell of the van. The new Rose and Barbie doll. And Terrius, so separately. Fair back, your favorite Jewish rock and roll nostalgia van. It's Russia, China, not with their greatest hits album, Sock hop at the synagogue. My rare life that is going to surface the baby. Oh, baby, my rare life that. Yes, Russia, China, and I, as reformed to bring you 12 kosher cuts of hop and Hebrew hijens. Let go, baby. Isn't good for you. This album should be in every orthodot rockers collection. Rolling stone gives it five stars of David. I wonder when did it in the new, wrote the book of Joan. Sock hop at the synagogue. New from Russia, China, and now available in all records stores. We'll find breaks when you get here. Don't pass over to this album. They hee-mm. Okay, it's 1240. They're two open lines in Broward. Look at that. I think that's the first time that's happened since a week ago. Socket. I'm Ted Cuffle, and this is punch line. There's been a major breakthrough in the science of mail, Conforception. ABC's Barbara Walters has more. Ted, I'm here at the University of Louisville, Labatoy with Dr. Richard Robinson, was invented in New birth control pill for met. Dr. What does this pill do? Well, it's actually very simple Barbara. A man puts it in the shoe, and it makes him limp. Ted? To Mollonide, we cross a praying matters with a termite, and get an insect that says grace before it eats your house. I'm Ted Cuffle, and this is punch line. We land, the cow is flat. Up and minus zero, it's a war. Oh. Scary tales can come true. It can happen to you if you're carry heart. While the white is away, in the townhouse you play. If you're carry heart, a big price you'll pay. If with women you play. Not once it was twice. You were caught with misrides. You're really not too smart. If you can't stay apart, now you won't be present. Carry heart. You won't be the present and know. Carry heart. What a shame, eh? What 26 the WIOD? The Palm Beach line is just sitting there waiting for you to do it. 655. 9463. 655 WIOD. Okay, I'd plunge at least a thousand on this one right, Phil. Absolutely, maybe two thousand. There we go. We want a great course of the post-devers. Yeah, way, we got it together now. We're not going to just do a clock this year. We're going to give you the big presentation. Absolutely. Well, I'm ready if you are pal. You pick Marissa's night, right? In the third race with what is that kid's first name? Alfred. Jose. Jose. Jose, can you see? Right. All right, here we go. There's a quarter of a mile to go. They turned for home. They went to half and 46 and three in Marissa's night. Opened up a two-way sleeve. Sapphire, Mr. the inside is second with lovely visions. Inspector Randy's Liberty then comes Tika Star looking from toward the inside. Norths first is next and then shy little girl. They move past the eighth pass. The race is night extension lead to four. Tika Star toward the inside now comes on second length. They have back to Sapphire, Mr. Then Norths first with lovely vision. A 16-mile to come, Jose, Alfred is driving over the old race today. The race is by drove off by yourself. Tika Star's second is Norths first comes on third. They come to the wire and Marissa's night, the meal run just special. She wins it by four and a- Tika Star at distance second with Norths first third. Incredible. Incredible and six-hatee-deal. Hey, I'll take it. That's a six-dollar horse on Monday and the six-hatee-day or whatever day that was Tuesday. Yeah. And six-hatee-day. Right, we're all day. And what a way to respond your laurels for the weekend. Two out of three in our first pick, right? Not too bad. And this one, and amazingly, I usually look. Durk-Ackerman's got the great in entries and he picked her fourth. What did I told you? But I saw Alfred's at six to one. I forget there's a good shot. Absolutely. And this kid can ride. She can't and she ran a hell of a race today. Evidently. Why are the wire? I'd have bet at least a thousand. And now the guy- see, this is what's going to confuse these people. I was going to say I'm holding back on him and I really know something so on Tuesday. When we pick next, he'll want to go on put 500 on the horse side pick. So I'm going to pick a real stiff on Tuesday. Oh my god, I don't say that. Now I'll do my best. I always do my best. You did very, very well the last time we did this. Yeah, now listen. You were standing out of the paper. That's right. What's going to show you if now I'm going to go no racing form. I'll just take the paper, pick a name. I was going to start having a racing form sent over to you. No, hey, that'll kill it. Now listen, swirling funnel. I remember I told you the guy called in yesterday. Right. But the more I reflect on it, I think he called after 11 o'clock. Uh-huh. So the race was already over and we forgot about it because you had that extra early post yesterday. So I have a feeling he might have just had the post at you. Yeah. Yeah, I think so too. Have the one of those after the race experts. Right. Uh, you know, anyone can do that. But let's say said you didn't before the race. Yes, by 20 minutes. Right. So anyway, look, I hope you have a great weekend. You too. And uh, how was Thanksgiving, by the way? Thanksgiving was fine. I mean, maybe I did. How are the best. How are you? You bet you. All right, towel listen. Have a great weekend. Then I guess I'll talk to you on Tuesday. Okay. All right. Take care. See you, Phil. Bye. Bye. How about that? Draw it drawing off and winning all alone. Marissa's night with Alfares. I told you six eighty. Anyway, uh, here he goes sliding the microphone over again. Ladies and gentlemen, a man who is desperate to speak to the world. How's your neighbor doing? He sucks. Okay. Do you, uh, continue eating? You ate big turkey yesterday, right? I didn't eat a lot yesterday. Now I had, uh, Thanksgiving dinner, but I didn't go crazy at all. No. No. Very, very judicious. We did eat that we picked out today. I noticed that. I'm doing fine. Why do I look fat? You all have a son? Look like you're wearing a wig. I think I love, yes, I have. I've lost back about six or seven pounds. I'm almost back to where my low-up point was. Is this to live a little way to go? I'm not doing so bad. I just couldn't think of eating today. In fact, this shirt is way too big. I'm staring at where bigger shirts are. So I look even slimmer. You what? Well, yeah, because you picked out yesterday. You cheated. You went off. He went off the deep end. He's wearing his deep ends today. He met her. He pounds yesterday. Oh, boy. Well, you know, that's not real. You know, that that'll even out over the weekend, once you get back on a straight narrow path. Uh-huh. But Monday, you'll look like Elaine. Anorexic. Boy, she is so hysterical for Cory and her. She was just crawling on the floor and clawing at the helium tank there. And look at the other scars on that tank there. Man. Anything. She said she would just give millions to just get anywhere near his body, just for a little feel. He's way too young for him. Exactly. He's under 100. My amy. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir.

And I'm going to talk about you and how you, WIOD got stopped with the fine. Right. On the cross, I'm going to play the, the song. Uh-oh. Not in Broward. I don't know what this guy is. Oh, thank God. Not a BCC. No way. El Sherrford have we went to Khuskau and no time, man. We went Luther. Yep. Okay. Anything you want to say for the record to the cross? Get a life. To defend yourself. Get a life. See you. They're going to say to you. Okay. Thank you. Bye. 147th to defend myself to FIU. I mean, are you kidding, sir? Speak at the English and put you up. That's all I can say to that guy. And just like I said, the application, your guilty and print until proven innocent. That's what Johnny Dark found out. He is guilty. His neighbor is a slime ball. His neighbor's going to spend 20 years in our Kenya. Norman Kent's going to have him put a boy for life. Right. I thought the Nazis were gone. I mean, I just didn't realize that they were still on existence. Foolish mate. Do you believe in produce?iorian ones. These are si beefよしes.

In the driver's seat is the second most uneligible Bachelor in South Florida. He's all nuggly. We're going to Iowa, Marana, to recalm it. And I just wanted any women down there listening. We should be in about, uh, I'd say about 330. Okay. They're all scattering now. What is it? Is that on? Hit it. You're going to use the, yeah, there we go. Did you say you're going to use the production facilities here when you got off? For a minute. Why? Good luck to you. Why is that locked? I have the key. Oh.
