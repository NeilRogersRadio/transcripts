On Beach 655WIOD and Bell South Mobility customers make it a free call by dialing star IOD. The opinions expressed by the guest host of colors are not necessarily those of this station. Now here's Neil Rogers, a new dog radio 610WIOD. Well here we are at the ZAR again and it's getting more bizarre by the moment. Just look at this crowd that's building. We got a handful of strategies here already but they'll be coming in and big numbers surely. We hope for a 3200 West Oakland Park Boulevard just two miles west of I95 and we got it all for today. We've got some real serious crap here today. We've got the t-shirts, both kinds, both the unbelievable t-shirts, those beautiful things that the t-shirt Bob designed and the Rick and Sud's snooze cruise t-shirts. We've also got the best Neil tapes number three. They're already selling like flapjack and Saudi Arabia and 20 bucks apart for whatever you want. And also we've got some stuff to draw for. So anybody that's here and that's going to be coming in. Be sure to fill out one of those entry blanks because we have some stuff we're going to be giving out including. 20 dollar bizarre bucks certificates that are good in any of the 500 merchants here at the bizarre. So we'll be drawn for those. We've also got some passes for Friday night breeders crowded, Pompeto Park. We've got some stuff that I don't even have any idea what it is. Who knows who has any idea? Mark 13th Club seats. That's the next week at specs. The Miami Dolphin Alt Pro against the firefighter all stars when's they March 13th, 730 pm Palm Beach Community College. And this is where 25 bucks for the pair. I have no idea what it is. Somebody said it to me in a Southern Belle envelope. Nobody knows what this is. Somebody will come and explain to us what it is. And then they'll come in like crazy and sign up to win those. Also a pair of tickets to. Off Broadway on these 26th Street. And it's a production at the Wilton Manors 1444 North East, north East 26th Street. And if that isn't enough, everybody that comes by while they last today. We have a collector's item that we're giving out absolutely free. In fact, we might pay everybody a buck to take one. From last year, the bird lives. Well, we need TV for these. I'll tell you the bird picture of those beautiful or what. In fact, George may model what you really supposed to do with these. Look at that. We've already we haven't even started yet. We got almost a thousand dollars already. Is that possible? $690. And we just sat down. So let me add that to our total for Camilla Sounds. Because that's really we're here for two reasons today. And that is to bring a lot of people out to the bizarre and spend billions of dollars. And also, of course, to raise a couple of billion of our own for Camilla Sounds. That puts us already. Oh, that's a softball game. The dolphins. Oh, so that is the dolphins. And the firefighter all stars in West Palm Beach. So anybody who comes down like from North Broward or Palm Beach County, who might want those, will draw until we find somebody who's going to use them. 43,000, a hundred and fifty three dollars and counting already for Camilla Sounds. So already like in the first few minutes. We've done about seven hundred dollars here today. We invite you to come on out there. I just everything under the sun that you could imagine for your holiday shopping here in the garden. They have over 500 shops. They've got you name it. They got it from jewelry to handbags to shoes to clothing. Everything else under the sun. Name brands, discount prices. And we're set up here in the food court, which you will always kind of like being here. Because that's why we have fat rich set up over there on the end of the table. Just to make sure that everybody gets sampled just a little bit from kosher, from Delhi over there to Italian food to Mexican to sausages and chili dogs and yogurt. And everything else under the sun. So come on out, bring a lot of money. And let's do a little piece of business. We'll come back naturally. We're going to have thousands of going to. Let me ask you something. There's somebody conspicuous by his abs and so far. Crowd all smiling, hoping, praying. Some people are already genuine, reflecting and praying. That maybe it's an omen. You think he'll be here? Okay. Rick Raleigh and so it's Coleman also promised they're going to stop. I am sure Johnny Dark will be stopping. Indish Norr up some free food and also put on a big song. It's an answer about the coast. And give a couple of free plugs. Now how come I'm curious why is it that the coast gets all of free plugs on the AM on IOD? And yet if they're mentioned, New Rogers on the FN, they're going to Cardiac arrest and flee with Groover starts breaking CDs over his knee. I don't understand it, but maybe when Johnny comes into the day, we can straighten that out. Gilbert, we can't believe it. We're in shock. But wherever you are, take a sharp right and the speed it up. Okay, put the pedal to the metal and speed it up. You'll be people are, I haven't seen any crowd. I mean it's a small crowd so far, but I've never seen a group so happy. And what was her name again? This wonderful lady over here. I don't remember my Alzheimer's is a Sophie. Of course, I was just testing to see if you remember Sophie. Sophie is here with her unbelievable t-shirt and boy, Does she feel it? I'll tell you. Look at that. Got all mighty, dolly partens.

We had them for my house. Since this Alzheimer's kicked in. I can't remember a damn thing. You know it. In fact, it seems to me I almost the most of it. I'm a steak. But I almost think I had a dream that you saying you were New York Giants. Football fan. I didn't hear that. Did I? No. I'm a top and fan. Oh, yeah. Now he's a dolphin fan. Because I got a bunch of the early people with hostile looks on their face. Now let's see. I don't know how I'm going to do this. That's another 80 bucks. So we're over a thousand. 43,533. Now let me share a little secret with you. Okay. This year we started our Camilla sauce drive earlier than we've ever done before. We started November 1st. So today is like 28 days, four weeks to the day that we started. Last year at this time. Last year we started like I think in the middle of November. Of course last year we had a little bit of an impediment because somebody was on a show. I didn't like to talk about all of this too much. And also I went out vacation to get in November. So we got off to real slow start by the 10th of December. Last year we had a total of grand total of about $3,500. I wound up with 76,000. I would go to the bank by John Lake bus. Hey, I got news for you. If you go to the bank right now, these people will give you a standing ovation. I just can't find the sign. I think there's a mirror first. Right on the slide. I was a few minutes late. Yeah. I was excited to make a check the catch of 300,000. So I could buy these two t-shirts. You can give a 300 bucks for the two t-shirts. Outstanding. Some of them are a couple of more. Okay. So that's like what these shirts? But that's I was saying now. You could go to the bank. You're going to hit one hundred thousand dollars for Kimelius House by John Lake bus. You could go to the bank on it. And now you're out savvy by the people. I'll show it. You'll cover it. You can't go back. You can't go back. You know, the bank man is bizarre as he is. You know, he's the only man in South Florida. They named a shopping mall after the bizarre. He has got more money than God. Okay. Even the coxistures are jealous of this man. Now where the hell did it all come from? Would you family like in bootlegging or something? Yes. Yeah. Have you ever heard of the stock market? This one stock United States such a go. This stock is selling about 65. A children split two full on at 41. And the stock has been doing excellent. And when Alex. You know, if you're seeing him and Marshall more together, I've never seen the two of them together. How couple of months ago, USS was 46 and a half. Now it's 65. And what about it? And what about what? And what about you, fund now. They said, yes, they have my culture, child. They have your book. Which is your job. Stop where you invest or you own it. Well, I invest. I've set that to Alex Spendeth to find out. And look what it did to him. I know. United States. What would that happen to him? He got old and wrinkled just after you talked to him. It was fun. And you want to tell us the real story of how you got stood up by joy reels on a hot date. You want to tell us that story? I think it off time is past. We can hear this thought is ready for us. First, where you'll show him. We remember that on the stage. And you'll hide it right after them. When I was with Joey, back time. Yeah, but he invited you out on a big date. I know. And what happened, Gilbert? Yeah, he treated me to a couple of beers. Oh, yeah, Mr. Labs. Yeah. I've got a couple of months ago before I got candy promised to take me to see the movie ghost Many. Never caught me after when he was blackened about that. That's right. Let you listen. We remember that. Gilbert, can I ask you a question? What the hell are you talking about? I know now. Okay. 1031. He's in good form today. That's excellent. We got a couple of calls on here. I'm mobile on the star line. Good morning. Do you like to be our first real caller of the day, sir? Absolutely. Okay. Give me your best shot. Alright. Speaking of Alexander. I heard heaven and hell. I've been a report if you haven't already heard. He and two other disjockeys from across the country that are near-pombed on the Registing Cathy Lee show over a three month period trying some new test to Paragrow. Yeah, he's trying to grow something. Uh-huh. And I don't think it's here either. Probably not. Another thing is, is I was in Wayne Arnold's three four times. And I'm the board. I don't know if it's a subliminal thing or not. But it's a bottom. It says, now, favorite. No. Meal. Well, my best friend's call me Nelly. Okay. I didn't know that. That's really it. Another thing I'm heading on the term, like through lake. When if you want to send some express pictures up here, I'll fly him out the window as I go by. Okay. Take a great life, sir. Okay. 1032. We're still waiting for our first call. You're absolutely right. Okay. Can we, uh, would you like to start the ball and hand these out to everybody that's sitting around here looking like they're in a coma? Just pass them around and see if anybody takes them. Okay. These are our bird bizarre pictures from last year. Saving for next Halloween. You poke holes in the eyes. Put them over your face with a little piece of string. Oh, you ever would you like to model the bird picture to give these people a little idea what you do with it? Well, you should have a fun. We've already got this all set up here. Go. Come on. Come on. Get with it. Model that. Stick that on your glasses. I mean, I think you're going to have a little bit of an improvement. Oh, look at that. Wow. Gilbert, you have never looked better in your life. Does he look like he just came from the monsters or what, man? A match made in heaven. It's Gilbert and the bird together in stereo. And the glasses are the perfect. He looks like she's so proud of me. Those are incredible. Herman Munster would be proud of you, Gilbert. I know. Outstanding. Is she going to, because I don't want to start this button and stall around for like a half hour while she's crawling around on her hands and knees. Okay? This is Wild. Ladies and gentlemen, where we always screw it up, give us a chance. If we know how to do it better than anybody in the world. All right? Anyway, did I miss something? What is Nancy doing over there? Nancy did you swallow a feather? What happened? Oh, she's looking at she's checking out Gilbert. Man, I'm telling you, no wonder they have insisted that family. Oh, one. Two. I'm free. Take me up to the ball. Why me? So cute. I'm so cute. I'm so cute. Everybody. See if you can look back there. We're hanging over this thing. I think that's what's that. That's what's that. That is pretty pretty. Everybody. The zombies. If they don't wear that to shame, for it's one. Two. Please strike show out at the awful day. That was beautiful. It's somebody who's going to be like this. Somebody in is on a payphone. In. Hey, Neil. Is this the Ian? Yeah, and I'm at the bizarre. He's on a pay in the bizarre. Yeah, I'm right around the corner. Yeah, well, how come you're calling us from inside? Are you to a very little show your ugly face here to all these girls? Can I just go see? You're still busy up there. Anyone into us? Now come on. You can come right up. Thank you. I like you, Miss Ian. This woman is very upset. We don't have a real lady on the stage where you can do it. Okay, I'll do you right there. Huh? Okay, we're holding our breath. I like to make you, Ian. I'll bet. I can't believe it. Another British type? Where are you from, Ian? Besides hunger. New York? You could have fooled us. Okay, why don't you hop up on the stage, you idiot. And show everybody your ugly body in face. Okay. Yeah, try to get up out of that chair, okay? Don't let me in. Don't let me in. Sure, the stage is already sharing it with Johnny and me both. He's on the edges of both of these seats. There you go. That's a microphone sir. Hi, Neil. See hello to your public here. Hi, everybody. A during public that is very, very good. They were about rating it really, certainly. This could be a real short stay. Now, didn't you bring Cory with you to sing? No. Thank God. Look at a smile on these people's faces. We had a meeting at 1230. I called the cast. He was down here. So I figured he already knew about it. Who was down? So he's having his own little meeting. Boys down here. Boy, he's still here. No, he was here. He told him to get the hell out. A lot of the public came in. They said, go back where you came from. He's on a bus to Louisville right now. So I'm not at a meeting with him. Great. All right. Outstand. So let's have a good time. You talk for a couple minutes. I have a slice of pizza. I have no pizza. No, come on. You've got to a clock. You're a public here. Talk to Gilbert. This is not my public. Hey, let go. I want to send each one of you a thank you. No, for that fact. Hey, guy. That's good time with the H.A.L.S. Yeah, I know.

So Gilbert, you have your Venetian blind shirts on. I left him home. Gilbert is wearing a shirt the other night. And he's got a Neil Rogers shirt. He says, Rick, how you like my shirt? And he says, but I've got one underneath that I don't think you're going to like. He says he's got a flushed limba. And then I see like through flushed limba, I see another shirt. And he pulls it up and he's got us. I mean, the man is the walking snowman. A mix with man. I thought you'd get like gimbal show. You're kind of the winkest. Just enjoy your shot.

I'm putting a couple of funny promos together when I get back. What is cloud to kelvin? A lot of school and what is cloud to kelvin's toilet? So it's way too heavy. You see, he has those spots. You mean we get to play in first. They're not going to be on QAM. No, you got that. On the head, Kaplan show it about two three in a morning. While I play surf on them. Great. That's great, Gilbert. Okay. 1242. We got some callers. Still on the board. Man he is out of the room. He's out of the room. What is he doing? Hey, forget about boy Gary. I want to say something new. People okay. Don't you think these guys have been on in the afternoon. They got great numbers. Everybody loves him. He's the most everybody. He's playing just right here. They're whipped out. You know, I would tell boy Gary take your little ding-dong school. Stuff it with a mongoindone. Shut up on a bus back to Louisville. We got big important stuff to do, okay? Yeah. Right. Yeah. I mean, this is the same guy that whipped out. Let the Schmedrich come and take over your whole show the other day today's ago. Because, what are the guys doing? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. All he does is come in here and suck up free food. That's all he does. It killed almost three hours. It was a great show. Yeah. Help me yesterday too. Koy is a nice guy. Well 43 at Wild. What's up? How are you, man? You talked to this lady here. Well, we've talked to all these. How long have you been here? Right from the day like the whole time. From the day. She got offended when I said these people have no life. They come out to see remote. She said, I heard that. And you've been here since 10 o'clock. Could it be here until 2? Okay. I want. She's got a banana. She went everything here today. Now, what does that say? Boy Gary says, you can't say that. So our pedal they're waiting for. I don't get that. That doesn't make any sense. There are people there waiting for him. Here? There are people waiting here. At the state radio station. Yeah. Well, it's too bad. Screw him. He should have taken a break. Okay. Now we had this big. This is one of our major fundraisers out here today. He could do that any stick in day or the week and cut the crap. Right? Isn't that what you want to tell him? I guess I have to tell him for you. OK? Phil Sault's been ladies and gentlemen from color race track. How are you, Neil? Phil. I'm a lot lighter than I was yesterday. My wallet is narrowing out. After my lunch with Kenny Dunne is a great guy. How was it? How did he go? How did what go? How's the meaning? Go on for the races. The lunch or the races? The lunch or the races? I won't ask you about the race. Just the lunch. Lunch was great. He's a super guy. He told me that normally or the other, they're going to pull up that tart and crap. They're going to for a down a real surface. It's just a matter of time. Nice guy isn't it? And I said to him, I said, how come? Let me ask you, how come you guys don't have the late double out here? That was the dumbest thing. He said, well, starting with tropical alcohol, do we got it in here now? That's right. And I had the late double that had a chance to bail out yesterday. And of course that great $7 late double. I had the one two five with that mortal lock in the night. So I had a throw one of them out, which one do you think I threw out? Phil. Don't tell me it was the two. That's correct. Oh, God. And it came two one five. That's how I, and of course I walked in. And who do you think won the sixth race? I walk in the door. Clara's boy. Yes. Clara's boy running for the 400th time this month. And I said, not for me. And naturally he won. And my horse is ran second, third, and fourth. Sorry if you're right. Exactly. But we had a good time. And I didn't lose that much. And Katie got lucky. He was bombed out of his college usual. Made of cash to good bet. Good. I'm glad to hear you had a nice time. So what do we got here today? We haven't picked anything because we've been a little disconcerted here. Yes, I know. I was trying to call. I was wondering if you had picked anything while I wasn't there. Our nose a couple of times while these people were looking. That's about it. Well, you had the second and third race left to pick from. Well, we don't have a paper. Anybody here got a paper with the entries for colder. Not the popular entries, Mike. He wants dial-athing for $2.20. So Katie show. He wants to go up on a bridge and jump. One track with Robbie Benson. Well, I'll tell you. We'll see if we can't rush them up a paper. Okay, look. I don't have a radio. We just won't call back in a little while. I'll see if you've picked anything in the second or third. Okay. Okay. Thanks, Bill. Okay, Paul. See you. Let's go to an important call on Miami Beach. North Miami? You know what? It's a good day. Pick up choice. Yeah. You're probably able there in about a half hour. It's a guy who was hanging out the restroom here this morning. North Miami. North Miami. Neil. How's the food? The food is excellent. Pizza is good if I were going to chance to finish it. The hot, the wini was fantastic. The last guy would be jealous. I'm sorry I can't make it out there to the bizarre today. but I want to go ahead and send a donation to the Camilla House. Can you give me the address to where you're at? WI-4 on ads? Well, no, we're at WI-4. So why OD Miami-33141? Can you handle it? 33141. That's it. Also, do you have the number of the guys who call who said he donated $100 for the medical and murder machine who were abysed one of those? Ah, huh. Somewhere I got it. I wrote it down. 858. 858. 06. 06. Oh, 9. Oh, 9. Yep. OK, Neil, good luck. Thank you, sir. Have I? Well, need it. OK, 1248. Now, you're going to get in trouble because you missed this big important meeting. What's the real heavy duty people? I'm going to get in trouble with right now. I think the meeting was the great. Weaver's at the meeting. He's upset that you sat in the chair and he wants to get it straightened out. Could be. Because he just celebrated his birthday in case you didn't know. Are you going to go ahead and go home? Hey, I get to get it right from my show alone. He signed this totally out here under the guys. I think it was a set up by the key in boy Gary just made it up to get you out of coming here. I don't think there was any meeting at all. No, these are my people I'm staying here. Are they? Yeah. Well, that says a lot. OK. OK, now listen, we have a big extravagance. And we got Johnny Darkworth's Nancy. Is Nancy right behind me here? Boy, she is everywhere. She and that incestuous family.
