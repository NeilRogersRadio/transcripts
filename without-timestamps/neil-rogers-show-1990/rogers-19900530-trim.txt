You don't think you guys take it easy because you each do good things. I mean, you have good points and bad points. Yeah. Unfortunately, Joey got more bad points than good points. Well, I remember. I'm going to learn. I'm trying to learn from Neil. You know, I'm more hang around the better. Yeah. Here. Try to kiss him a little. When you go, let me kiss him. So what Neil's trying to explain to you is you've got to develop your own. He's keep your eye on your mouth. Wait. Next time. Yeah. What? Yeah. I'm afraid of that. You just did the wrong play. I got the right answer. I'm at the wrong place. OK. So we have a celebrity collar on the phone now. OK. The other nice line. OK. Let's give this over. What do you want? Hey, is this the joint right on show? Yeah. Don't you wish you'd be here in a flash. Are you coming for the free food? I only $80 billion a year here with a screaming Christby. She can't afford to buy his own lunch. I'm sad at it. Hey, Joey. I'm a leave at you. Joey, why do you think they call him Neil? Joey is for the jolly things he tells us. Always for the oblong shape of his head. He is for the excitement, excitement, excitement, and why must be sleeping with ambition. And not only then, I have something else to tell you, Russ. What's that? Add agency people and articles. I'm a recipe for the price of a grill. Yeah. Is there anything right there? You don't need or the time. I've got a couple of things I want to square away. Yeah, that's it. First of all, I wanted to write it as the you say, gee, I got you a piece that's coming million dollars in the audience. And there's this what you don't end on at the radio station. Hey, is it not okay to have a couple of very little pounds instead of just one thing that you do at the time? No. It's not. No. Tell them what you're going to do. You're going to buy spots. Why simply is going to buy a few commercials on your show. Yeah. The send to my own personal position. You're getting a viewer attempting to show them. Really? Really hurting my feel. You don't sell screaming spots on this show. Wasn't going to scream. Who's going to talk nice about you? No, I'll show. And that right, Russ? Absolutely. And you know, you're really hurt by feeling. Right there. Well, but I know what you're going to say, Russ. Wow, I was just going to say that everything I'm saying no phrase. Yeah. Well, on that page, I'm 35 and WI was doing well. I couldn't leave him on anymore. Get the trickbook out, Pan. Yeah. He was weird work for this company. I want to see a bigger profit margin here. And I got something to tell you off the year that I know that's a secret. And I'm going to share it with you. But I would have asked for somebody. Nobody. No. I know something that you need to know. Because I just, I hear the light. I'm waiting. What do you need? I have a note. By the way, she's not having a better one. They brought pizzas. Anyway, let's talk about fat Tuesdays.

It's so embarrassing. If you're not a user, show the censor. We're just in your joke around. He gets all the money. That's been out of shape. Or have his all defensive? People. So let me ask you a question. Sure. You know who Joey is? Yeah. You know who Bill Marshall is? Bill Marshall. Good. Okay. I want to hear Joey show on a weekend on Saturday 10 to 2 on 6 10 WIOD. I got better things to do. Okay. Excellent. That's not it. Someone's just taking money away from the company when you do that.

Why makes all those that cruises the Bangkok? Those people who think that it was cruel for GTR to change the UNIS staff overnight. Obviously, weren't in New York when Joey went down with WNBC because that was like two weeks worth of whining and crying and complaining. My home. By Joey. Oh, where are you talking about? When NBC was going off the air. And it wasn't even there when they were going off the air. I was, I left with SuperSews. We both got fired at the same time because they didn't want to buy our contract. What was the great deal? I like it there. I always say they're forever. But of course. I'm going to read some of that. You write about 50 grand. I'll just say, oh no. So I'm 50 grand in here. I mean, where are you made? When? When I was doing that? More than I mean. Yeah, where were you? You're at WNW. Okay, having WL. So how are they now? Are comparing showers? Yeah. Can make money? Well, can I make a hand? Ready to make here now. About 15 bucks? Okay. And I didn't have any. How much I make, which I will not discuss. I know what you make exactly. Can I do? Yeah, I thought you were answering. How much? What do you want to give out of the air? No. Give me fingers. Not that one. How much is it? No. It's almost not even closed. Much more. Three by this. You speak five minutes to try it out. Five to two. No, yeah. Maybe I won't have some people. Ending off. Okay. 143. See, or there, I don't know the kind of all I should see. I don't know. I won't see. I don't tell anybody how much I make. But since you're such an expert, you think that you know how much I may or you give me that crap a lot, my 20 or 50. You're great. It's great to work with you. You made, you made. More than I made. Let me say this. If I was in the US right now, making what Steve is making, which is the same as he was making here, I couldn't afford to live there. with that?

From the Gs to the Palm beaches, even out of the Bahamas. This is WI and G. Okay. What is it? Mr. Grayvine goes around telling people that the reason you leave stations is because you are at the leaves station because the lawyer bills become too big. Oh really? Oh really? Well, I did have the ones. Yeah, one second. The first of all, I wasn't asked to leave anywhere. Oh. You took the other job. He had the exact same. Well, when you leave somewhere, you're making double the money. You're not asked to leave. Okay. When people treat you like cramp and they don't know what they really want, you say goodbye. You find something better. Yeah. Well, he gave the impression that every time that you left the station, it's because the law took the following into stations and it gets too expensive to keep. Yeah. Well, I hate to break the news. He's a rolling lawsuit spot against two radio stations, both by the same person and a web publicized in which we don't discuss. And he knows that just is everybody else. Yeah. That's our great. Our great, our great, domestic grade line. Okay. Okay. See ya. Doctor, that's another winner. Name grade line.

Why doesn't Joey just face me? He's a loser. Yeah, no way. Why did he come in here and kiss me? What is wrong with you? He's trying to really make me a real-time to suck up to. Yeah, no way. Yeah. Joey, what the hell was that on your turn? No, it's a lie. It's a lie. It's a word. If it's like the guy told Calder, which it is case wasn't true. But Joey, this just no place in this market for your type of... You're for one. He does. I don't want to say that because I don't want to make the man be present. He's like, I got it. And his sidekick over here is so damn sensitive. He knows you. He just look at him, cross side. Right? He's like, oh, you know, all the fence. He's like, oh, no sense. He's humor at all.

Here's a matter of just four hours on the O'Rige. Every Saturday every other word is the O'Rige. Why did you start doing stuff like on the Rick Weaver? I've learned some things from you. I haven't learned why from Rick Weaver. No, so you came here. Is it a market? You still like in the same state. She came here.

I heard of you when I first came. Oh, you can be all the time. It was good. I've been done midday. And I've been done midday. And all of a sudden I was on FM in the morning. So what's your hands? What drove me? All the way to craft. I mean, of course you did. But what drove you over to FM? More money. Well, why did you come over there? You didn't all of a sudden, you got jealous. You're sitting there. You're listening to me. And I'm making noise. I got jealous. Here. How long did you suffer from these delusions? The way them in. I came to me. Gary Lawrence. A great Jewish guy came to me one day. He said, let's go have lunch. I knew right away. I was going to get a right in the bag. The first one I was in a oxymoron. He said, it was dying. You came in and said, kept saying, I'm dying on the hand. It's always said, in between, in between, led Zeppelin and the CCR. That's all it. And they needed a morning show desperately. Whatever I gave them numbers. And then they'd brainstorm. We know that way. You scared over the heart. You were sorry. I'm just, no, no, no. That's it. You're wrong. You know what number? Well, we've read it. Number three. How you're demanding money. That's the day. Can't we don't be number one? You'll take any information. You'll take any information. You'll take any information.

Exactly. Now we're getting closer to the truth. Well, you know, we're all around the same age, everybody. And they say, I'm the youngest guy. The only one that does not have a special preference problem on the whole staff. Yeah, that's why he runs around kissing all the guys when he's in here, right? Yeah, and you have to, this thing. You have to sit this way. It has no hangups. You have the same strange, you know, turkeys, getting hangin' off the neck. I am not. That's for damn game. I have that Nancy Reggableosity face cut it off. It looks like a gobler. Now what's the problem here? What is the problem? Why are you picking on me? Who? You? I'm just milding what I mean.

I came here from New York. They put me on the air with a strange audience. And they did not hear blame in the audience. No, no, no. They blame in the audience. I played and worked off the show. Come here when I came here after Sandy Peyton and Bill Smith and Bill McQueen in the Paola, how do you like when he heard that audience? She was the queen of talk before you.

So here on the air, there I'm on the air on that. And I was on the show. You got jealous about the morning show. Yeah. Okay. I got jealous. Yeah. I got a knock in the bar. I think you came over and kicked my eye. I mean, you're here at one time and you said, I hope you beat me in the ratings. You're left out of the eye. And we took the card and we played it and we played it and we played it. And then everybody believed it. Yeah. People do believe things and you start all these reports. You had it yourself. It's like a death wish. You have me positioned here at the end of the show. Ron, see. That's one to 100. The biggest mistake I ever made was being your friend. I mean, look when was that? And when you grabbed it, I held with me. I'm your friend. And you start grabbing my friends at my app and you ran off with it. You did a top version of it. And then you come up and sit me on an app and station on the other side of the line. Who was here talking about it? Everybody like Howard Sterns, Thorazak. He went back to the city by the bay. Now what is it, man? Are you still there? Yeah. Have a nice day. Right. Okay. Let's go to a moral gevels. And the jury Reynolds show with Bill Marshall and the O'Rodgysin. The Rick and Pucks.

Wouldn't you be embarrassed if you made me as it always were screaming and just insulting? And how can we be running those spots on the coast? That's like an easy, you know, a little uptempo. But the easy station we don't want to hear. And 85 dollars. What do you want to hear that about today? Well, this is a very successful operation here. What? This radio station. The editing? Yeah. No, the radio station. That's taken any ads. Why do we start away? We call the bad team and put that fake right of business. Why do you call them a fake or he's very successful in the game? No, okay.

Channel 5. 7. When he had that show that was much ahead of Saturday night live. They were doing good together here. Are you stucking up with him? I asked him. If you think of all the show, I think about you. And I'm not knocking. It's just honest. Surely at least sucks around with people who have a lot of money. And I'll sit in more down in. Of course, you went bust and he don't have anything to do with him anymore. Now it's rust. Okay. No, that's not true. I mean, you don't have the order. I mean, if you don't know my M.O. is you don't have an idea in the world about my personality. Your daily is M.O. You're still building what you're wearing it. Projecting what you are that you don't even realize. What I am. I don't have to project. Because that's the way you talk. I have to play for I was at Europe since. I love rust. I'm a little afraid of that. Can you name a friend of yours? No. You don't have any left. No. You probably put all your business on the air. It's a person. He's not a friend of yours. Oh, trust me. He thinks you're a, he's a fan. It loves me. There's a difference. You're a lot of fans. Well, I'm not going to mention any of my friends because I don't want you calling him as starting rumors. How many friends do you have? You don't have a lot of friends. How about how do you know that? Because I know where your friends are. You think you know. I know the world. I know the world. I know the world. I know the world. I know the world. I don't have a guy like that. Fat rich a band in your room. Where it's the silk suits. The buffet went fat rich is out of your room.

The prices right. 12, 48. That's what they say in Thailand. Isn't the prices right? We go, don't you ever want to explain that story? No. I want to keep everybody in the dark about that. Unless you want to be the one that does it. on the tape because we'll need a later he goes to the honor out are you okay see this is good because out your witness this is a difference between me and myself with a paycheck is that i know what i draw the line and i can like titillate and hang it out through so to speak but with jolly it's like an elephant in a china shop he just once he gets started was way over the tracks will be a jade out of control don't allow lies on here. It's you really are you're sick. Did you dump that? Yes, I don't say it again. You don't like that word again. You won't eat lunch. I'll take it that. I won't say. You made something but won't be lunch. But that never made the air. They don't know what we're talking about. If it would have made any way. So what have been your show? It would have made the air. Oh that's because I wouldn't eat a dump it. Would you have dumped that? You probably wouldn't have. No, because you haven't got stood down. What he says. You're like a whizzling. I'm not even starting you know. I'm like a whizzle. I don't like it. I know that when Joey says something you want to be going on the air. Well did you want that to go on the air? Is your decision Neil doesn't make any? What do you think? Do you want that on the air? What's that again? Okay. It's uh, seem with this audience. You didn't make any difference because they don't absorb any of it anyway. So there's like a man on a mushroom farm. All right. We talk about Toyota Hollywood one more time and here's how you weigh in. Wayne Arnold was here. Look at how skinny he is. You never knew him when he was a fat pig. I can say that now because he lost all the way. He is so slim now. This man used to be, say he had a gut bigger than Johnny Darryl. He didn't believe that. And he slim and trimming lost all the way down. New true system. He looked great. What's the name of the restaurant? Wayne Arnold's Arnold's Royal Castle. 125th and Northwest 7th Avenue. Isn't it the right? Yeah. After Whitehots and the Neely burgers and the Castle burgers and the birch beer and the good stuff that you got stuff down your fat mouth. Are you happy now? What a weanie.

I just wanted to make a comparison of the Joey ran on the show. He's not what he wanted. He's not what he wanted. He's so poor. He's right in the other room. But we're feeding your free food here. What is it? I'm preaching. I'm making to go to the other thing because I know some people haven't seen it. See why? I might have kind of reminds me of. Haven't seen Wayne. I'm in this haven't seen one. I listen to the Joey ran on the show. Okay. See you to see what was on channel 10. Yeah. But then it became too embarrassing. Yeah. Even Joey was embarrassed by it. It's kind of like it's like reminds me. I commend him for that being honest enough to admit that his TV show is a piece of crap. I commend him for that. It takes a big man to be that honest. You know the show sucks. At least I went up to that. I don't know you guys you know tried it. It's so funny. A lot of guys have had it. It's like it's big bread. It's still sticking up in the air. And it's still kicking for you. No it's a ride. You know there's still something there. It's just kind of kicking around and somebody should shoot it. And they know they should shoot it. But it's just a simple road. So nobody really watching in the back. Call 54. W. I mean I was one of the classy weekend callers.

I listen all the time. But I hear everything. How did you like Joey being in here today? Should we ever do it again? No. Let's take a poll on it. Are you serious? No. I don't know. Keep the guy at break. He needs a job. He's desperate. And I got to be honest. As much as he takes me off in time. Everybody comes in. And you're looking at him with that star. He said, four-lord, look. You kind of feel sorry for him. He's not such a bad guy. Yeah. Then he walks out and you start thinking about it. And you say, well, maybe he is. You don't want to see that kind of a thing. Yeah. Joey, one of those people you really hit kind of like, mixed feelings about, you know? Yeah. Kind of like a love-hate relationship. You know what I mean? Is there a theater? What is it? If you've been to the Jupiter. I have never been to Jupiter in my life, sir. I got to come up here. It used to be a per rental theater. Really? You guys just bought it. Great food now. And so it's like a little plug, huh? Yeah. I'm one of the, or the man. Well, what do you got going up there? Like, Debbie does the deer field or what? What? No, we're playing. I'm not sure if deer field that ought to be pretty interesting. I'm not sure. I bet. But anyway, it was great, calm. I don't have some lunch. You won't be able to see him. I'll try that. He turned sideways. Looks like carrying carpenter. What was it? Have a great life. Yeah, it's an amount of half the car you can. I was worth it. Okay. How much did it cost? I don't know. It's therefore. Okay. All right. Bye. Don't expect too much now. They weren't here for like two hours. Call cables. Hey, just listen. How you doing now? Are you just listening? Yeah, I'm like, where? You don't have to phone them. This phone is for talking, not for listening. Okay. If you want to listen, go buy a radio. What is this? Welcome to Boka. You're there. Yeah. Because you just erased you from the board. He's getting way ahead of himself. He came on and asked me if I was still there. And then he came on you on the phone? You know how he is. Boy. Play one car with his voice. And right away. I don't know how he's going. You know what? I don't know. Control that melon. Yeah. That's the show. So what's going on? You're not things we're going on in your old neighborhood. The two people of the, the husband and wife of the kids were like, Taddy corner across from you. Got into a fish fight with a guy next to them. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I heard about that. Would the two buy for something? Or were the whole, the animal with the animal to home? I don't know. This was something else in the wife. But another one? Yeah. The wife. You're getting the middle and she got punched not the cold. I'm serious. I'm serious. Oh, boy. I was wondering if it had the family had made fair folks. Yeah. They had the family. Yeah. That old guy on the corner. He is, for whatever. Where have gone to the Christy? Christy. Oh, yeah. And he's still doing. He put up a big shrub that they didn't want or something. Or he was on their side of the line. Yeah. And I, it was nice to live with people. He gets so hysterical and emotional about things like, you know, a leaf falling in their yard or, you know, your dog took of something on their driveway. But that's how it is all over supper. Well, not really. Not when you live out in the boom ducks here. That's the place to live out with the frogs and the ducks. That's where he is to go. Trust me. And the swamps. Yeah. I'm going to wait to do it. Anyway, that's about my story for today except one thing about Joey. I was at his show. His TV show weren't really. And he warms up the audience by doing homophobic, you know, Rogers shows. And so he is not, he is not worth even having him on the show. So as you know, the phone he toothpaste. He said before a computer, phony toothpaste. Frying for a slime bag. That's true. Yeah. Well, that's what I said before, isn't it? Yeah. The doctor. He can't just pull. I know that. I know that. The other staff for a look on the space. But he's deep inside. It's a conniving vicious, vicious person. Only girls can interact stabbing. Oh, volature. Ferrended. But not bad. Yeah. He's not other than that. He's great. See him. Okay, I'm glad we got the truth out on the table. No, it's got to be before he left. He was standing there with his quizling. And he's going on about. I owe it to you. What I am in a market today. And the fact that I'm still working. You know, here's a guy who's basically unemployed. And he's standing with his straight face. Thanking me profusely for having a job. Like even though like four hours a week and who would have it up to me. They wouldn't let him in the building. So I don't understand what these people are talking about. Whatever happens if it's good or if it's bad. You know, I mean, if credit or blame for it, okay, I just. I don't understand it. So it would be like mark 10 track calling. And you're calling right now, and he's a boy. They never would have found those stuff in my trunk. If it wouldn't have been for you in your big mouth, you know. Wild. Hey, I want to read. Yeah. I'm just a. Hey, Joey. This guy. I just flowed down. Take a breath. Just relax. How many of the time will be like this? I just go through his face. But it's been, you know, the vocal lines and tie-up. All right. lines were real sizzling when those guys were in here praying that we wouldn't talk to them. Yeah, but you know what? I mean, the guy in the he has a horrible show of pilots do a half hour in total since he's been there. I mean, high a high a. That's all he does is a high a high he's got the sidekick that makes me sick. All he do is talk about where they worked. I mean, can he go a whole show without saying, oh, I used to work up in New York or in this place? No, it's like, oh, I got a only work one day a week so I got to remind the people that I would you want to use to be big. He used to be big, okay? But what happened to like Wayne Arnold? He used to be big. What happened to him now? He's small. He's big. Well, that's uh, and he's uh, clearly does the ball on your show and the old night. You know, you're a big soft thief. That's right. You should really keep the guy out next coming. What's the coming in? And you would I know he's going to come and I challenged him to come and I know he's going to be referred to hours. You know, the general team was here and he gave me that sad puppy routine and they want me. He didn't notice as soon as they finished all the food, they got out of here like Grant took Richmond. So they're gone. As soon as they finished and that Johnny Darken extra was the biggest pig in the history of even porcup. He would be embarrassed. Once the food is gone, they're history. They're gone, out of the ocean. Well, you know why? You want to wait to take a couple of days, well, I have a wonderful life. They haven't paid for their sex. What is it? They have to pay for their sex. It's what they haven't got any money. Is that what it is? Yes, but nobody had half of it. Well, he showed a lot of free kisses and feels in here. I tell you that I got to be honest now. I keep telling them that. I don't know why he does it. It's a it sounds it is revolved. I'm not I'm not joking. You would fact that people who are expects in the grow that they saw it. He comes up to you and he like he just draped his skinny ugly, smelly body all over your neck and he just grabs your head and your fist really trying to defend yourself. Any plants this big lip ridden tongue driven growth. Let's sloppy ugly, marmi kiss. It's enough to give some of you to want to peel exactly. I feel like I'm having a real life. So is this doctor this morning we already before I come to work. I'm doing great. Everybody's happy I'm losing weight. I'm doing fabulous. I come in here. The man comes in and spreading his personal disease is all over my head. Maybe you know, he ought to go on the night guy news for half a to be picky. Okay. I have better taste than that. But I know you do know your problem is the people that I want to come and kiss me all over. They don't want to do it. He and me comes in and re slobbers all over my damn face. It really sounds like you know where how much I tell them I'm not joking. He believes I think it's funny. It's not funny. It's sitting in. It's gross. Don't allow him on your show anymore. You're a fan don't want to hear him. Especially your two thoughts. You're a soft guy. I'm soft. There's no question about that. But I'll see if I can change it. I have a great life. Okay. Well, the audience is pretty emotional now, which is good. We like to mold these things over now. And then see if there's still any feeling left in the WI of the audience, which has been bettered senseless over lunch to several months in October. Kendall sometimes I feel hold on. Let's try open park is it? Yes. Hello. When is this? Where is the? All right. Okay. What is happening in your life sir? Well, I was driving down 95. I've been down a lot. Yep. And I started singing that myself and it's getting so catchy. Now I may replace some time. I've been driving down a lot. Okay. I'll tell you the show's a lot of fun today. Yeah. I'm having a good time listening to it. Good. And I'll tell you Joey Reynolds. I mean seriously from the heart. Okay. He's a lot of fun. He is fun. I mean, what are you going to abuse him though? Yeah. Well, you got to think we have such a good time on seriously. We have a great time when he comes in here only because I'm a lot of them on the law, but I just do it. I abuse him. And he ought to insert you out of him and he gets all antsy and hysterical and it's great. You guys sound like professional wrestling. You see, they shouldn't have bill Marshall as the side can. He should have somebody who come on and abuse him. The audience would love it. He have an 80 share like the old days. He shouldn't have some suckling on her. With that funny laughter, he should have somebody that rips him who is vicious and nasty like me. Well, I come from the hook. I think I'm going to come in on his show this week. I'm serious. I tell you, and I rip him and ask, you know, I was in New York this weekend. Yeah. I listen to how it's turned and his show is one big advertising thing. I mean, he doesn't talk. Really? Yeah. Real bad. Like for less being done with it. No, it doesn't even do that. Really? Well, that's what happens when you make an all-in money. They've got to sell a lot of spots. Forced lives. We've got to break that position. Listen to I'm it. Yeah, he was good. I'm it's his great. He was good. Yeah. Fabulous. He was nice. The funny guy. Yeah. And he's got a great sense of humor. He writes a lot of his own material on what some of us who steal everybody else. You know what I mean? I'm talking to him. See, they show is so bad. We even play other people's jingles. Okay, that's it. I have no shame out of the text. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I just want to write a credit for what you do on the radio. I mean, it's not easy. See, Joey's title, Joey's problem is he doesn't understand what I do and why I've been successful and that bothers him a lot. And underneath all the laughter and all the crap, I'm serious. He doesn't understand what I do and why people like it. And if you ever figured about, then he'd have no life because his whole life is centered around that obsession and what I told him how much money I make. When I told him how much money I made, his eye boy, look at Sammy Davis, his eye ball popped out of the table and he had a grab it. I mean, he just went nuts. He went crazy. He told him. Yeah, I was seeing that. I'm not, I don't do that. I think that is the craziest. I'm not Steve Kainsher. I would never do that. You know, as this is Steve Kainsher, when he was down here, yeah, he was some interesting people on the show. Too many times though. I think he was the same people. You can only go to the world so often. You know what I mean? That's what you're on lady. You have to say, you can only go to the world so often and then it fills up. Very risky, sir. Yes. I got this question. Okay. Yeah, I've had a doctor said. Okay. Well, who is, sir? I got this great to do. Well, the question is, is it, you know, all these face shuttles that are going up? Yeah, it's great. I mean, every week, Jimmy, how about telescope? Yeah. Not even the telescope. Every week, each other something else is going up. And it's like, what you wish? I have no problem. Okay. Every week, something's going up. And like, what is the question? I don't want to know, do you know what's going up? Is it like TV satellite, like channel, like stations, sending a satellite? Can I close the call with a little Jewish proverb? Okay. I'm going to hang up. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. What goes up? Must come down. It's 118 in WIOD. We have a couple of lines. Honey, can you bring out some of our barbecue sauce? We are all changing here. Hey, what's your main channel, what is it called? Oh, no, we got it. Yeah. We are so sick. Oh, yeah. Hey, come on. Let's go out and go around. We're going to be so busy. What problem do you have? We don't buy a chicken. You stay there, honey. I'll get the buck off. Try it or be bothered by annoying, bodyheads. Try new buck talks. Be routine. TOA. Hey, that per se is valid. Honey, it all is a little depth out of here. Oh, I hear you. What are we up? I'm not a human. I also have you get rid of pesky hands. Just try this fake rash. Look at this. You don't have a good. You have a good. Hey, you see, you all act when bodyheads bother you. We have your black talks. I'm just thinking about Joey. You know, because he embugs me. Because he's like the best in case. He's got the same problem that Steve has. He's obsessed with me. I don't know why. Why? What is the problem? What did you find in the life Joey? Stopping out of the sense with me or his eyes. Talks to you all he thinks about. Comes up and kisses me like my sister. W-L-I-O-D. Yeah, I'll be right. Can I even have a sister? Yes, sir. That's me, buddy. Hey. Am I right here? Yeah, I'm afraid so. Ah, real. No, you know. We are Joey, Captain. No, no. We're in an all-prepagition. You know what I mean? And by Mr. Boyer. I bet you me, buddy. Hold on, so we're going to go back in just a second. I like some wiggly fields. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you accept the collect cost from Jack Quilland Jr.? Yes, cargo. Yes, man. No, all right. Okay, Jack. I'm at Wiggly, see you. I'm staying in our front. They're really seeing it with cargo nanos. And it's about 62 degrees. Yeah. It's a bit of a... You think I'm kidding? No, I believe you. No, I'm out here. I told you I told you, I told you, when I got up there. We just got to the park. There's about 65 degrees. Well, I'm glad I warmed up a little because last night it was frigid there. And Harry wasn't too happy about it. I really, really feel like I'm not an asshole, a little bit. Yeah. I think in the first day it's a little bit... About 48 degrees. It's about like I said, it's in the 60s. Anything colder than the weather in Chicago last night was the play of the cub. The cub's not dead. And that's what you hear, the wilderness of Congress, you're going to move them next year to Manila. Good. They're going to climb the Manila folders. Yeah. Hang on, sir. Don't go knocking our cubies, sir. I wouldn't be up here. That's how the white shirt should be. We can pick some of these things on the radio. The most excited is rambles on. I go ahead. Jack, women, did the cub games. Yeah. Do you want to hear it? Sure. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's telling Joe Way to call Nick as soon as possible? What does that mean? What life is that a message for me to put on the air? Is that it? Have Joey called Nick as he'll watch Joey. Marvin. Watch Joey. Joey Reynolds to call Nick as soon as possible. So while you're in your car pole over to the phone, was he got a quarter. Get the quarter from Bill Marshall. And call Nick. He's got a job for you. Yes, sir. Okay. We're back to the football game team today. The fans are out to get a ticket or two. From Wala Wala Washington to Carlin, Mr. Yips a beautiful day. Follow him. Why is an attribute for the game? We're gonna cheer. And the fans are out to the ball game. Hey, cool day. We're gonna cheer. We're gonna cheer. Right, you don't think that's a chance. And the round of the game is so good. We're gonna cheer. We're gonna cheer. Today I should go to the press. I got the message. The guys should say, have a three-king day. Hold me. Hold me. Ha ha ha. See you. I want to say the end of the game. Yeah. Oh, that was a hard time. Yeah. You're the one. Who said so? Oh, that's a hard time. Oh, that's a hard time. Oh, that's a hard time. Oh, that's a hard time. Oh, that's a hard time. Oh, okay. Any other messages you want us to give on? Or can we go ahead and do the show now? Tell Nick just to crawl under the table and say there. Where do these people in this place are? Not. Twenty six after one at Wala Wala Wala. By the way, we got a new fall line of coming. Enjoy. I'll be talking about that on Saturday. Kendall. Sometimes I feel that life is passing me by. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Deal. Haven't heard that much. Do they have one? I think it's a good idea. We've had people just interrupting our show. We haven't had our regular thing. No. There we go. Ready? Yeah. I'm ready. I'm always ready. I bet. Sometimes I feel myself. Feel better now. Yeah. Okay. Nothing much. Oh. Relaxing. Good. Enjoy Joey today? Not really. I know. Pretty ponderous, huh? Gratful. How many times do we have to hear about how big you listen? Buffalo and about how you say WNBC and you used to make all the money used to have a job? You know, forget it. Nobody cares about the past. I think you said that. I feel like my saying, hey, I got the giant numbers of where you get all that to the past. We're just holding our head above water. We're treading water at this point. Nothing lasts forever, you know? Yeah. I think that's the reason I think of it. Yes, sir. Which is right next to Chief. Chief de Waga. Hey, man. That's where Joey kisses you on the Chief de Waga. He is. I'm telling you, if he ever got around you, you would call a police. I'm telling you, call the riots squad. You manage out of control. Yeah. Look up for him. I mean, if we go play, eat you up one day. I'm afraid so. If not my type, believe me. Not anybody's type. Well, hey, me. I think this is a day to forget, right? What do you think? I would agree. Let's just cross it on. This is what I mean. Why is going to be great? You want those real men. Mark my words. Tomorrow is going to be great. You think so what? You're I just had that feeling. I can feel it in my bones. So we just touch a gift tomorrow. Who's my special guest? Rod Roddy. He's going to come in with his silk suit from the price is right. You're not going to believe it's going to be phenomenal. And how about how we're stirred? And how are we? We're going to do lesbian dilatates, turn Rod Roddy and Howard Stern. Yeah. Have a great life, sir. Roddy, I was 128 at WID. Now we're picking up just a little bit of steam, eh? Poor Latterdale. See what I mean? That's a line six. Are you there? I heard somebody like Belle's your puke or something on it. WID. No. Yeah. Are you? Okay. I think she won quickly. No. I am Christen. Come on. Getting a headache from all the questions today. How are we? Can we just go back one second? Sure. Are you giving me just a second here? Absolutely. There's no one anywhere. There's no one overwhelmed by their presence. But alright, let's start again. How old? No writing. No question. And you have a question? Oh my god. Oh God. I got the per... I got to... I knew he was. We had this other card. I didn't even know we got all this material. Well, let's start again. And you have a question? Let's be answered to the question. What do you get to know? Wait a minute. We got the other one where he says, Where the hell is he going to go? He says, what's a question? Where the hell is that one? Here it is. Oh God, we got all three of them. We got all Larry King Tri-Fekna. And you have a question? What's the answer to the question? What's the answer to the question? How's it going? Oh man. Incredible. Now you feel better? Oh God. And when you're as good as you go, the bigger nose than Joey and more money too. What is in here? Why does Larry King give Joey one of his jobs? He's got about 85 jobs. He don't need all that money. Right? Get him off our back. Give him a job already. He wants to be ubiquitous. No, he wants to be me. That's his problem. Yeah, he's an Aussie. Did you see the little blurb in the paper this morning about the FBI and the finger-lake track? No. Oh, you didn't? No. Oh. Were they investigating Ross Morton? No. What they did was the FBI thought. Didn't they investigate they're going to charge him with impersonating a track announcer? Oh, yeah. He's terrified. The worst. Oh, this guy, because there's worse than Ross Morton. Well, Bill Carter's going to be so upset because Tony Bentley is a good friend of his, but everybody I've spoken to was said that Tony Bentley is laying an egg in Carter that chicken little bit will be embarrassed. I mean, he's trying to be objective about it. It's just terrible. The guy in Trevor, I mean, they got this new guy. Probably with Park and California, a young Australian. Oh, I heard him. Oh, you're not going to start with Trevor Denman now. Yeah, absolutely not. You're not to Trevor Denman guy. Oh, you've got to be. No, I'm not. Yeah, I heard him like that on Harvey Panthers and he sounds like Trevor Denman Jr. Right. And what they said is true for one race. It's different for nine races for a guy. Is that what they were talking about? Yes, because I didn't. I, I was reading the paper and I was watching it in the background because I was watching that show every night because it's a good show. Harvey, back is great. Yeah, he's the best and the guy that John Watson. Yeah, he's good to. And it's a fun show if you like horse racing and I headed on and then I heard the guy's boys and they showed two races. Right. And then I heard him say something and I didn't catch him. And I thought that's what he said. And I thought, now he can't be ripping the track and out. So because they would never do that. So they were ripping him. But he just started last week. It's a new these 24 years old. He's from Australia. I don't want any. He uses all those British expression right. They're on the straight and they're this. I mean, one or the first court. I mean, they're on the straight and four on the straight. We don't use those expressions in America. You're going to come here and call the race. Don't try to bring a Sydney with you. Lisa Nian said they. I agree. I said only Randall would say. They did a thing the life. The FBI was investigating. They were the race. They thought it's not a thing. They thought it's not a thing. They were like, they were. God, I can't believe that. They were. And they thought it's cheap places in the sports. That's in the morning. Just little bored. They thought it's cheap. They were who paid its own rent. Let's put it there. They did find no evidence of race. Of course. We know that would never happen. Not an ice racing. You know, finger lake. I sure do. I heard I was there the day it opened. You can go run. You could cancel out with the ice. We'll take a day when you are. You could build a bigger track in your backyard. But finger lake. That's incredible. Why do you think Ross Morton works there? You know that he applied for the job of cars this summer. They turned them down. They couldn't. Yeah. First of all, did you go to anything front here? I talked to throw at a lake. He didn't want to add it. No, he's not. They didn't get that job because they just got away. They had a hurricane. They didn't suit us until he got screwed on that. Then he was going to go Hollywood Park and they didn't want to give him a contract. He was going to go to the lake. That's the track I've heard of. He's really flaky. And as a history of hiring and firing people every week and he didn't want to pick up and go all the way out there and have a bad deal. So he just took a summer off. But he called me and he's going to the track. He's doing great. But he's not announcing the race. No, he'll be back. He likes to charge us. Ah, hit him. Oh, do we? He is the most operated. He knows. Even though he's living. He's sitting in the other. He's the most egotistical, pompous self-for grandizing next to what Trevor Demon. I left your thoughts to pay for the answer. That was great. Well, I've got the Belmont coming up. Will we come again? No, no, Mr. Fisky, by the way. You know what I don't should do. Yes, but there's going to be a hundred. Forget the hundred. I'm here's a piece of garbage. I had at least a little interest at the moment. And a greatest thing that I ever saw one of the greatest moments in my life was a easy go or get a desperate third in that metmala. I saw it again last night. I can't see it enough because I don't dislike the horse. But I hate padday. And I dislike the people in New York who refused to give another horse credit. I mean, Sunday silence is a better horse. Easy gore is a one run horse, which is why you notice it a lot of those big races like you. He would baby him and baby and then make a one big turn. They say, oh, he waited too late. It's a one run horse. And if he makes it move too soon, like he didn't this way, though, or hands he's got nothing left. He's not as good as he thinks he isn't New York. Okay, trust me. You see, when you have a horse like Sunday silence that's usable, I can go to the lead or race from just off the pace or come from middle of the country. Back to the horse. When you got a horse that's like his way back, like Aladar. Aladar was a good horse. But he had one big run. Okay. And that was it. Where's the turn to run on the lead or from behind or whatever? That's a great horse. But if I was saying to someone yesterday, in the bedroom, Aladar has a firm beak. Well, that's another story. Now, let us fire. Anyway, see you at the sand box. Okay. Bye-bye. Yeah, we'll be out to sand box one of these days because Colter was in here with the yesterday and got around pretty good. He's been, he really had been very sick. A lot of people realized that and we're not going to go into the details on the year. But he's, you know, and then just like Aladar is sick with the stroke. But he's coming along. You know, well, he looked good. Sounded great because I get so little sun gets a little cover. He'll be just like back to you. He's putting some weight back on. And then we can go out to the sand box and have a few laughs with those 40 dollar claimers. Right? Well, even take work and punch out there one weekend. Now, you guys have your hooked. I'm telling you, come on. We'll let you away. Give me the money. Okay, Joey. I'll give you the money. If the mountain had a good time. You guys gotta try something new. By the way, Joey thinks you guys are a pathetic. You know why he says that? Because he wants you job. Don't ever drop the coast. When Joey isn't all the trust me, I'm just going to put a little advice. Also, put leaving all your stuff in the U.S. I had Aladar. Toppy left on that chair. See all this stuff? That I had a salvage for you, all your spots. Try to get a little more organized. Okay, when you steal my cards, at least put them in order in your briefcase. Okay. God, these guys are on mess. More tables. Are you still having trouble with just satellite dish? No. What happened? We're finally having with that. What finally happened? Yeah. I moved. Dad, a plantation? Out of that area. Oh, because we're the same problem in the city of Coral Gables. Oh, well, forget Coral Gables, sir. All come at the same. Unless you get a duck that you tie to the roof and put the dish on a duck's bill. We see they can't prevent you from getting a satellite dish. They only just make it so difficult that you wish you were dead. Right? But what I mean isn't the worth it? Yeah. Also, what happened with the voice of GTR, the notchisman? On the other side of your station, channel 7. Stocktapin. Is he still there? Oh, yeah. They don't use him on the new boat. Oh, so we got mixed Lewis on it. I don't really, I haven't figured that out why because which usually is the A and production guy and Scott has been pretty much the FN guy. But Scott's got his own little business over there with Sally and Channel 7. He's got a whole little industry going in that room. I'm Magno. We're not going to call you Showman. Did you see what your name on TV yesterday? What's that? Debbie? No, I did not see it. We only have a little Sony in here. The screen isn't that big. Oh, well. He was on two channels. I think two, two, big. They're open up on the channel. Yeah. The one next to see Span. What about the next door? No, it's twenty three and a forty four. Oh, she's found she's found two. Yeah. And then there was she's going to be the English Channel next week. And fill it all up. Do I sound not one? Oh, there's the number two. In the English Channel, everything with the English Channel is. Nope. It's like a body of water. Oh, hold on. Hold on. Okay. Madam Chair. And the last guy that did they, and what happened to him? The young up on? No, he's in San Francisco. So, how do you know Scott? Maybe. Anyway, I know this appeared. I don't know why this occurred disappeared. And I came across. I was doing some stuff this morning. And I found it again. Now, this is one of my favorite cards. Nobody ever requested because it's not really timely. But I like it. W-I-O-D. Hello? Hold on. And so, I'm going to play it again. I like it. Okay. I mean, you know I get too fast. It can happen to you if you're carry out. I'm going to start singing. While the wife is away, it must sound out your play. It's your carry out. I've been surprised you'll pay. It went with a win and you'll play. Not one that would fly. You are caught with this right. You're really not too smart. You can't stay apart. Now you won't be president. Carry on. You won't be the president. No. Carry on. What a reason. What a job. Great. And long. Not as good as this. It's just a sign of power. This is here that we're really good for. We don't have to wait. No, buddy. It's from my team. Remember, remember, remember, remember. That's your trust. So find yourself in a body. Not just anybody. Find yourself in a body. Do you know? So, thank you. All right. Sanford Cisco's got a weird city. 21 till 2 at W.I. or D.I. L.A. How are you doing, Leo? Okay. What's up, guys? What am I up to? Get ready to go home. Get ready to go home. Get ready to hit the road. You're not going to mom's flashlight? No, I don't want to go on Tuesday. Sir, if you're keeping in your diary. I don't want to watch my mom's later on. What's he making? I don't know. I can't be between Turkey and at Rose Chicken BBQ style. Rose Chicken Bud? Think something like that. No. I just want to tell you one thing. If you ever have a lucky internal problem. Careful. Because a lot of times we think that our parents are dumb. When you're young, always be a person, I think. If you ever have any, like, internal congestion. Remember, once they moms know a lot about it. They're the experts. Okay. They know their stuff. Definitely. Definitely. Trust me. Definitely. They know their, believe me. I read the paper at some lady. Mary Bacon. She was, she was, she was, she was pregnant. Yeah. And she was, she was actually in a race. Yeah. Is that legal? Why not? I mean, you know, she can hurt the baby. You know, maybe the track she felt. How about it? The horse was pregnant. This is the horse was pregnant too. Yeah. Well, I'm happy. Mary's run while they're carrying something. Really? Sure. I've never heard of that. And if some of the guys do the jogging. Oh, yeah. Better in the family way. Listen, who do you like tonight? The pisses of the bulls. Who I like, you know, I want to see the bulls when. Because I like, yeah. I don't know. I really don't care. But I think the pisses of home are going to be tough, right? Yeah. And are they really, choke the last two games, boy? And Chicago? Sure, did. Those bulls are a different team when they're in the friendly confines. All right, Neil. Okay, guys. Okay. Say hi to mommy. I love. Okay. Because mommy's here in Ozer. Stuff. Let's go to, uh, let's see, at Lady and David. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Fine. How are you? Great. Good. I wanted to cast my balance. Okay. Or on. Well, you're the guest. But Joey's great, too. Easy. And the two of you together are fantastic. Oh, my god. And I see you're going to encourage you. And the audience is going to get hysterical. I audience hates him. Oh, but he's so funny. Mmm. Oh, Rick and Pruss is another story. Let me ask you something. How can he funny when he's on here with me? Oh, what is on Saturday's? Trouble. Well, I listen to my Saturdays when I can. But I don't have an opportunity. And he's done his funny on Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I heard the wrong. The humor. Some time to watch the song. No, no. He's funny. Okay. He's so quick. I want to ask for a second. Well, that's because he's memorized all the way through by five cards. Even then. When you get that old, that's like, you know, like Reagan. Yeah. I cannot stand. It's just slows out. How busy? Who Joey? Yeah. But he. No. I want to buy him all this rink or call over. If he. When he's saying he was a straight face, try to tell me I'm the same age that he is. I mean, that's just one of the most bizarre things I've ever heard my, nobody has had a world. No, I don't think so. I don't think so. Because I was like a little kid and diapers grown up with me and Joanne WKBW and Buffalo. And he admits that. Yeah. Why do you know, just aging faster than he is? He has his big numbers up there. How come he's down here? That's a good question. Well, he loves it here. He loves the ambiance. He likes these romanticists. The weather's great. I love it here. Yeah. That's it. The weather's great. Period. Right. I can't do more breaks. Oh, my God. Can I ask you a question? Real fans. Can I call it a dupe? You just did. Can I call Bob a dupe? I'm just did. Say goodbye. Okay. 142. I'm sorry, Melvo. You may be high one. Tell you about the melting pot. Now that fabulous fun. And it's the second day I've done that. It's good. Open the pot. It's just on that last note. Wild. Shocking. I got through. Well, that's good. I picked it right up. I'm unbelievable. I had to call these other people who are now panicking because we got another break and they're going to run out of time and not get on the air. Oh, God. Did you see another dupe recall? Don't you feel bad about that? That at all. Good. Got it all. So what's your story? I had to do it on a plug. I don't want to plug anybody. Construction workers. Oh. Cause they'd love you too. Can you believe that? Yeah, I believe anything you say. You're trusting me. Yeah. That's what Joey said. That's it. And by the way, for the third kiss. Either way, don't ever let him on the air again. No, that was a bad mischief. Unbelievable. Told the show. They sure did. And I'm not going to make any worse. And then Nick is giving me an air. I said, what was that all about with Joey? Never call you back. No. I said, well, what was that about? No, then nothing. Walked out with a look like he just swallowed 40 canaries and a cat. Okay. Nick. Nick. Okay. I'm telling you, there's like this in Sanctuary. It's a little like all the quizlings in the building. They all kind of suffer ramigas. They know I mean. I believe you. I'm serious. What ever happened to TV? He called yesterday. Did he really? Yeah. I wrote a song for him. Great. Can I tell you it? No. I can't. Have a nice day. Thank you. No, we don't have time. North Lauderdale. Yeah, I need a little bit of advice, please. Yes, sir. The pillow. Okay. I got the job offer. Oh, with reran, lots of money. Great. Really good job. Or I can stay here at the job that I hate like poison. Yeah. Making very little money. Huh? Wettling my butt off off on the lawn here. Right. Which should I get for something else? Which way should I get for something else? Which way should I get for something else? Which way should I get for something else? Which way should you go? I thought the question was which job should you do today? Which job should I? But, you know, sir, sir, sir, sir. You're the driver, vinegar? Yes. Once the car. Oh, it's like paradise in the summer time. Great. And the food up there and the people and the sand and the wind and your hair and under your knees and just great. I'm just worried there won't be enough people that will say, Funny. And get out of the way. There it is, right. You'll miss that. But other than that, it'll be great. Okay. Then I think I will go take the job. Here's the measure. And I'll call you from up there. Yeah, call us. I sure will. There'll be a, you know, you won't have much else to do. Thank you. And one more thing. Yeah. Puts is my idol because he gets paid to do nothing. That's correct. Okay. So, Puts is my idol. Okay. Okay. Let's take a mobile and Palm Beach. Hello. Hi, Leo. Yeah.

Lal מה ki ma How am I gonna run there, man? How am I gonna run there, man? How am I gonna run there, man? Gay cocky and my opinion. I was standing. Okay, let's do that last break. It's just a little thing that we're gonna let's flip right in here. We'll be right back. We've got this this one with Yamaki. Bogot. I want this the same as you. I used the collar. Yeah, let's go to a baby, hello. Whatever I hear, Joey, the pain starts in my chest to go. And what's it? Let's go to Miami, hello. No. Yeah, they're getting good now. Yeah, they're getting really exciting. I want to ask you questions. How did I? I'm not a person. Yeah, well, I'll just get into the social business. I'm gonna say it for granted. I have one question. What does it happen to us today? How do we get sucked into all of this? I don't know, but I haven't had a question. Why? How did Joey ever? I don't know how things he was just for because I'm not that old, but how did he arrogant TV? Them as rumors. They were like, it was an accident. Really? Yeah. How do we hold handhandling in front of Channel 10 on a Michigan Boulevard? Was that a one? An and picked him up in a truck. And they thought he was a talent. You know, he said, oh, you got to show up on a winning side. And they threw money or that cardboard audience. So, I mean, would that show mention why to just locally? Are you still in nationwide? I don't know. I'm not. There were some of the cable companies are threatening to take Channel 10 off of that even if you're off here. That is, you know, right? Let's leave the embarrassment to this limit of burial. Yeah, I do. I don't know. You do know that. I have, like, this awful order all over my face now from him being in here in just, uh, oh, I don't know. I try to slam you. I ran him. What that? I said, it's a clammy feeling. That's not a good thing. Do. Not a good thing. But I mean, I've thought a little bit so much of you times, you know, because I was you ripping him and, you know, he's always talking about you.
