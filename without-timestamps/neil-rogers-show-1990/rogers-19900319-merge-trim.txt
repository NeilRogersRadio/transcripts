We brought him in. Since he muscled his way into the building. Are you auditioning for something? I'm not auditioning for any. Come on. You can tell us. I'm not. No. I wouldn't want you to leave. What? Speak up, sir. Speak up. Crank. I love those. Man, that's my favorite thing. And the whole world is when we get them when they're calling in.

That's what Joey says. Hey, you got to watch when you're spewing things out again. Now, what do you think of Bill Marshall being our new sidekick? Oh, he's an asshole. Thank you. He's an asshole. You got to be a asshole. You got to be a asshole. You got to be a asshole. You got to be a asshole. I don't hold back. Tell me what you're real about. I'm so sorry. No wonder I stick around in this God forsaken. We got a great audience. You know, they don't need around a bush bill. No, come right out. This guy thinks you're an asshole, Bill. It's Miami Man. And he's only. He got very thin hair, too, by the way. Oh, yeah. You probably hangs out with the Alex and Eric Lambert. Yeah, they can go to those hair transplant. Exactly. And then he bitch. You're fine. That MSU fight song. You got to play it. And the sweet 16. Oh, don't start. I don't know where it is, though. I don't know what the hell stand did with this. Yeah, you got to get on his butt, so to speak. No thanks. Yeah, okay. That for me. Okay, well, I don't know where the hell it is. Okay. How about those Michigan Wolverines? I mean, I'll tell you what. Woo. I loved every second of that one. Yeah, they can take a shower for a long time. 149 points. 149. What the hell is that? Well, Ellen Mary about the good team.

Well, when you're going to spew whatever you're about to spew, at least make sure we hear it. I know you're great. I know that. Could you put me on the arm? Sure. See, butt liquor. See, that butt liquor. And I don't go for that. The engra� sheeters out there. Does Joey like that? He likes that, doesn't he? He likes to be stroked. No, he likes to be. He likes to be stroked. Yeah. When's that going to start? Oh, you mean with management? Well, overloading all the grading. Overloading. Well, he's worked in a lot of places for a guy 70. Okay, we have an open line in date County, 7519463. If you want to take any cheap shots at Joey, now's the time to do it. Because Bill is here. You know, if you know who Bill is, or you could call and take cheap shots at him. All of the one guy did a good thing. There were more than well. That was pretty much a generic cheap shot. You can call anybody an asshole. Yeah, but in your case, he meant it. Here's a mobile in how did the remote go Saturday? Chuck? Good? Where was it? Chuck did the Saturday weekend magazine show. I forgot, well, actually, I slept. I can't believe it. I slept till 20 till noon on Saturday. I haven't slept. Usually I get my dogs give me up at about quarter to seven, which they did do. But then I went back to bed and I just slept like a baby. I haven't slept that late in years. Why used to do eight to midnight? There were a lot of nights I go up to eat. Come home and watch a little TV go to bed at three in sleep till 10, 11, even noon some days. But now that's the change. Since I did that morning show on Zayton, beat the crap out of joy. I mean, here's a, you know, you didn't have to beat the crap out of the way there. Listen, you hear that? You hear the racket coming from FM? It's a low rumble. Does that happen on Saturday? No. No, sometimes from this side. If they're pretty big. Sometimes. Okay, here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. And that also frosted my butt when he had what's his name. Larry Brenler on here in the guy called him wanted him to play the Bill Coltrue song. Sometime on the, on the, what is that he plays the flute? What is that thing he plays? Whatever it is, the mouth organ. And he wouldn't play it. Malice got all bent out of shape. What is his problem? Why can't he just warm up a little bit? Okay. Am I right? Or is it my imagination? Melvin says I'm right. Chuck of course. It also says I'm right, which is surprising because he's, he's a newsman. I'm trying to be not a little. What? What do you say, sir? I say you're right. Okay. Uncle Neil. You're just the butt-looking. What is it? Uncle Neil, the news can't say a few moments ago. The, this Tommy Mercer says that all the Canadians are happy that baseball is going to start. Why don't they just go home? Yeah. Well, that's what they're excited about. They're going to be playing in Toronto and Montreal. They're all on their way home right now.

I just came in to get some promotion because he's in talking about Joey. And, well, what the hell is there to talk about? He's a potty mouthful man with no act and no show and he says, Faggot every 30 seconds. That's actually what it is. The gets folks to listen when you, when you rip him. What? That's it. Well, what that's one of the things. I'm going to start writing it down. It didn't help it. The she, I talked about him incessantly over there and his numbers drop like a rock. Oh, what? I went down to a one three. Do you know what a one three translates to? It's like we had more kids in this room than we're listening to Joey and morning drive. Well, I was a great inside job over there. Management submarine that show much more effectively than even competition could have. Oh, here we go. In other words, these guys that blames the management. Thank God, I never do that. It's 12 13 at WIOD. It will be right back. See you. My 10. Tell me, are you a team?

I definitely towards a two. A one? On a scale of one to two, it definitely got an error two. Up nearer two? Boy, this man is profound. You've been hanging around with Joey too long. Yeah, what do you mean not that song that you played as more than Joey? Like right, if he'd start playing it, he might get a two. I doubt it. But it's worth a shot at this point. 12 19 at WOD, Bill Marshall's hanging out in the background making gutteral sounds. Here's a mobile on I-95. Are you there? Yeah, I know how you do it. I got a question for Bill. That was pretty weak wasn't it that ACN bit. That was great. Crapy. That's not it. Oh, it was an Alex. Listen, Bill, whatever happened in a Kyloere that was doing the show as a weather reports and all that. Do you remember on the day? He's living in a home in Philadelphia. Is that Kyloere? Is that Kyloere? Is that Kyloere? Old folks home. Yeah, that guy is honest to God for real. That's that guy's fun. That was the highlight of the show as far as I'm concerned. Well, it sure wasn't Joey. It's like an idiots' avant type. Knows every oldie ever recorded. That was funny. What do you mean an idiots' avant? You mean literally? Yes, honest to God. He was already. He was already. But are you serious? You mean, Joey was exploiting somebody like maybe Gilbert? He was exploiting him. Yeah, can you imagine? Yes. Well, Bill, you know the guy I'm talking about? No. I don't know if there's a car around or something. That guy is funny attack. Well, great. He's got a weird boy. Yes, he does. He's easy. Well, that's going to be our Joe Hirsch Show from 2 to 6. He's going to be exploiting a mentally handicapped and retarded people. Maybe they ought to have it on a Gilberl playoff with that guy, him and him and Larry. Okay, sir. Thank you so much, boy. That's revealing. Twenty after noon at WIOD. We have an open line at Date County where a rain man just hung up 751. 9463. 751 WIOD. One is the Oscars on. Is that Sunday? Saturday, Monday? Next week? Next week? Monday? Oh, well, we don't want to talk about it anyway. I'm sure what here lots about it in the afternoon. Anyway, let's go to, I'm serious. I never really dreamed that I would get to the point where I'd be hostile and bitter with this guy. But I am. It's not a joke anymore. He just bugs me. Just like you. No, I didn't say I don't like him because I don't even know him. But I just, he just says such frustrating stupid things. Okay. Okay. Okay. Good. Here's a. Mobile in Palm Beach. Oh, that laugh is just. They're just in chills up and down my spine. Is it irritating to hear? Use that like a cross between Lee Fowler and Paul Harvey Jr. You really do. Yes, sir. Hello. Don't be intimidated by this faker, sir. He's been sent here by Joey Reynolds. He's an O-Jompravacatur. I got a little bit of a Joey Spire for it for you. Okay. Well, actually, I want to talk to Bill. Bill, you there. I'm sure you're in. Okay. Yeah. I go along with that. Bill, I don't know if you remember. I can't Joey call on Saturday and I was in. Can you guys, uh? You're the one. Yeah. Well, I just Joey, uh. I just Joey, uh. I just, uh. I just, Joey, why are you feeling real ripped him so much? All the time. Uh, you know, you're leading to an answer for him. And, uh, he sucks. There is that, uh, an answer that. But see, not me over the one thing he did say was that you have a huge ego. Almost no, I don't. No, I don't. The Steve came type. No, I don't have any of those. Sure, I have no ego. I work with met with management that's brutal and, uh, I have no ego. But why do you consistently rip Joey? Maybe Bill can answer that. I just answered the question, does I think he sucks? Because it's something to do. No, not at all. I think it, but I mean, did you just say before that I have been talking about him lately? And you came in to try to stir up a little publicity because he desperately looked at it. And nobody calls and you couldn't buy a show with the million dollars. What is something like that? I say something positive. So, you know, he just had a, I think we're here. I think we're here. I think we're here. He's a great job. He's up every morning. He's a great business. He doesn't use anybody else's material. Why not rip the personality that the other day? I think he had a full word. My best friend is wonderful. He tells it like it is. I think Chuck Meyer is a great American. A wonderful newsman. He's got a, would just die to have two to six in the afternoon. He would. He wanted me to, but he wants to be a taco so bad. He would be good. He would do a good job. That's a great show on Saturday morning. He would have nobody listens. But Neil, how often do you do this? Except to make a green for example. She's a legend in her own mind. Now she's going into TV. She's lost control over. So she's gone nuts. She is. She's a legend among the blue hairs. Well, every day when they go down to see the CD rate, they have their little McGreen picture in their wallet. See, oh, look at that. Meg said don't worry. It'll be okay. You see Neil the plug that you just get. I got to make a break. Much better than what you gave to Chuck. All right, Joey's great. Joey's got the best thing to show. It's the kiss of death. Don't do that. Neil, the point is that you talk about Alex repeating material. They have to date and you ripped Joey every other day. No, I don't. You're the one that brought him up. You're the one that brought him up, sir. I brought him up. You've been ripping him for the last hour. If I've been ripping Joey for the last hour. Why? First of all, let me, let me say this to you, sir. I never even was thinking about Joey until his sidekick muscle is way into the studio. Okay. Now he's accomplished just what he wanted. You're complaining about it. He's happy about it. He works there. He needs the publicity. This station don't give anybody any promotion. Say goodbye, sir. Oh, what was that? 24 afternoon at Wild. We have an opening in date County. 751 Wild. If you have an opening in your teeth and call Prostmark Cosmetic Dentistry. But what a segue that was. That was pretty sneaky. Wasn't it?

The next time Ron St. John calls, let's play that before he does his talk up. It should write in 28 past noon. A very pressure-packed Monday. First we had the two groups from Piper High outstanding. Boy, they were great. Some greater than others. Then we had what's his name? He just left by the way. He'll be pleased to know that we froze him out. See, that works every time. We got it so cold in here you could hang meat from the ceiling. We froze his ass out, so to speak. Bill Marshall's gone. What am I going to say? The guy was in here. I told him to his face that his laugh made me my skin crawl and the joys sucks. I'm not talking just now that he left. That's what I'm saying. He's terrible. Okay, dear field, hello. Get out of here. Will you go to it somewhere else? Here's a payphone. Bill. Mr. G. Was that BM next to you? I beg your pardon. Was that Bill Marshall? BM, yes. Well, that's why those are his initials. Did you listen to him Saturday? I heard about ten minutes. They were ripping you with Dave Game. Don't ask me what? Dave Game? Yes. I know. But speaking of that, we're having to march for the fat people. Are you available? A march for the fat people. Only if champagne loose shows up. He said he'd be there. I'll bet. So how's it going? Okay. Not too bad. That's the purpose of your call. You seem to be all over the place here today. Kind of like buckshot. What a buck. That's what they call me, buck. Yeah. Buck him up. Well, listen to you. Keep it in your pants. Okay. See you. Round. Yes. That's his brother. Oh. And he was a nephew. Pete Lakak used to play baseball for the cubs. Right. Remember him well. Just don't repeat his name. I won't. Okay. Excellent calls. Now that we're stimulated this older crowd. It sounds like Joey's audience is tagging along now. W-I-O-D. Oh, this little bar show. What is it? Everything's fine. Oh. That's the, uh, that's getting close boy. His laugh is dead. You know, does he restrain himself in here today? But on Saturday. Yeah. Yeah. I can't duplicate it. It just makes your skin and crawl. It's like somebody is scratching their fingers. Not on a blackboard, but on your back with real sharp like Elvira's fingernails. Although I know a lot of you guys are into that. A West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How's it going? Okay. So baseball's finally going to be played. Isn't that great? Isn't that you excited? I'm offended, Neil. What can I say? I offended by what? Oh, come on. I mean, you got this crap going on in baseball and now marino with the dolphins. Forget about marino in the dolphins for a while. Okay. Forget about, forget about football for a few months. This is baseball. What is all the same in process? No, it's not. It's all big business, but we don't care about that. Oh, come on. Revictives of our own childishness. And this is Lousy. You got Mackin' Row. You got third girl. Here's about 10 is in about these 13 year old little pimple heads that they want to make superstars on. You know, I figured it out. Everybody in America is a star for five minutes. Okay. That's what it's all about. Everybody's on inside, uh, addition and morey public for five minutes. And then they're, uh, most of them become obscure. And now we have another star. That ought to be the national anthem looking for a hero. And still the star is Bangal Banner. The people in this country are so into idol worship that it's frightening. They got to have a new hero every couple of minutes. And then they want to tear them down and find out something disgusting in their background. And then destroy them and then make a new hero and then destroy them and get another one. Right? Right. Exactly. Did you catch that golf? Interesting. Vile, Volga. What is it? God tournament. Are you crazy? While the cubs were playing the cardinals on WGN. I'm going to watch some stupid guy chasing a ball. These are real gentlemen. I'm talking about a real pro sport. Uh, spare me the pain. Will you please sir? No, seriously. New York gentlemen. That's the most boring. That's not even a sport. Listen to this. Chasing some little ball around in a silly cart. Get out of here. That's your day. We could go out to win more. And they got to Jack Arandon. See all these nine year old, 90 year old farts chasing around their balls. They're gentlemen out there. Yeah. Poor. Oh, cares. They're gentlemen. They're all got so much money that it's a the skins game. And this game. I give you a game. Get out of my life already. These people are like Nicholas man. If they were dropping bombs on Palm Beach County. He'd be talking about that short putt. You know what I'm saying? All right. Listen to the next product. Listen to this for gentlemen. I'm serious. That's all these guys care about. Why don't they retire already? Give somebody else a chance. I listen to this. And he'll kid get hit on like seniors baseball like these hockey guy. That was so embarrassing a couple weeks ago when I had that old timers senior hockey. I'm not joking. I couldn't believe it. I thought it was a joke. And here they had these old maple leaves out there. Clopping along under skates that could barely stand up and no checking man if they breathe on each other they would fall down. Here was the norm almond out there. He's only a hundred and six and Paul Henderson. My god. I know I'm rambling because you got started with this thinking. Go off. It's more. I'm trying to say anything to avoid listening. You talk about golf. But there's only one thing I can do in that hang up. 1233 a WIOD right. Ron. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait.

Mm-hmm. How's everything? Great. This is tall. Yeah. Joel. How's everything? Okay. Don't keep asking the same question, Joel. Don't keep, because you have nothing to say. Don't keep saying how's everything. I say, okay. And then you ask it again. And he audiences and she's got. And this, Howard Stern would never talk to somebody who talked like that. That's true. This would have to have the IQ of an Australian pigment. I think we're doing good. I've had an average of it. I want a koala bear. I wanted to comment on that bill character from the Joey Rimmel show. Oh, man. Was that exciting? I was doing great till he came in. The whole show has gone down Hilson's. He's like the Ed McMan Jr. They say anything and he's cracking up in the background. Yeah. But he has that herniatic laugh. He got to go to the herniac center on Sonya. You know what this is. Come here tonight. The show is that wild, herniatic, hysteria. Yeah, nothing. Nothing's funny that he'd say. Nothing at all. And the life like it was like the last thing on the wall was one thing I wouldn't be called dead having somebody sitting in kaklingってる background on my show. That's for sure and even your right. But away chuck Myers on the weekend. He is a great... He's a great... He's a a a a really good talent man. How he ever wound up at this radio station is one of the great mysteries of All Time. He was a great newsman. got a gift to Gabby knows a lot about sports and about news and about anything he can talk he can speak. He's sure on Saturdays I enjoy. It hasn't taken a crap for anybody. He does play a lot of my cards though I noticed that but that's okay. By the way, I have a Joel Jr. The guy who always calls and then pauses me. My apartment imposter is you. Yeah, well, he's the imposter always calls him say that's so well. Yeah. He's right here right by me. No, no. No, no, no. No. No, we don't want to talk to him. Tell him we don't talk to phonies.

I want to take care of right now. Good luck to you. One fifteen at WIOD. We have an opening in date where Joel just hung up. Joel's taking grammar lessons from Luther's Skywalker, I think Luke. What is his name Luke? Skywalker? I doesn't really make any difference. What do you call him? It's still the same end result. And if Michael Putney is listening or anybody who knows Mike, I want to say it again because a really merits extra consideration that show yesterday morning on Channel 10 at 11 o'clock. The worst, the pits tragic embarrassing, okay? But other than that, it wasn't too bad. Look at that phone. We're down to four stink and calls now. Boy, don't ever let that bill marshal in the studio again. It's having a residual effect that's probably going to filter out all the way through the street. You stand sure or not. It's a very skewed stand. There must be a bad way. Then always asking us to pay. Don't raise a raise. Call the few do. I've got a pitfall. You'll let he will do. You always keep me waiting with great holes. Well, oh, so convincing. More than federal, it's fair. You raise a rate for service pay. I'll tell you where you can stick your letters, rates rate, rates of raises. I'm in the rate of raising rates of raising rates of raising. I live in the streets of the way. It's the right in this month. It's the service. They bet. Oh, God, listen, as long as line is rolling in the mud with all the garbage. Run, we get all the bad stuff on. Let's talk to another no-talent ladies and gentlemen. A guy who's desperate for exposure, who just can't measure up to Eric Lambert. I like Eric Lambert a lot. I think he's very funny. And got a lot of hair. Yeah, this kind of embarrassing because when I went when I went with Mark Mosley, ladies and gentlemen from Power 96, let's hear it from our studio audience. Where'd you work you hearing that just a couple of weeks ago when he was tickling all over you when you were in a studio? No, no, he was kind of tinkling on Maddie. Oh, who was with us, but he has a habit of doing that. The thing about it was, I think what I said was taking completely out of context. He's kind of like poison now. I'm very embarrassing because I really like Eric Lambert. I think he's really funny. Are you sucking around now? Well, if I was going to suck up to anybody, wouldn't be Alex because that's leaving. But I would be sucking up to you, but I, from day one, I thought Alex was just really tremendous. No, I really do. No, I really do. No, I really do. I said to myself, I heard him the first day he was on him. The guy is going to bring a lot to Miami. Yeah, he did. And here in a box, he keeps trying to paste it on every day. That's why he's got that glossy head. Now listen, we have a celebrity collar on one that Martin, Wait a second, between you and me, this is not on the air, right? Wait, no, it's just to dry run, Martin. I think the guy is really good. Alex better. Yeah, then taxi. Where have you got your finger while you're saying these things? I think the studio audience thing is it's, I've done him. But, I don't know, if he ever does this. I've done him. I listen. All right, stop before you have to go to the Hernia Center. Just hold on one second. We have a very important celebrity online one. Hello. Hi, Neil. This is Eric Lambert. How are you, man? Great. Good, I just say hi to a big admirer of yours, Eric. I heard Mark, I'm Eric. Eric, how are you doing? I'm like, oh, that's so nice. Hi, Mark. How are you, nice to hear from you, man? Good. I think you're really funny, man. Well, I think you're really funny too, but I'm one with you. No, I really do. I listen to your show a lot. I really think it's very funny. I like it. No, we're just, we're, you know, just going back and forth. If you would like ever to come over and do some time, I'd love to see you. Most of the people at Power 96 have done some time. Yes, we have. Now, you, you are a stand-up comedian also. You perform stand-up comedy, right? Yeah, I haven't done it in quite a while because when you do the morning show, it's hard to get out to the clubs and the... Well, you'd be great on the Alex Benichoke, because he hasn't done it quite a while either. By the way, speaking of comedy, I have here, for you, man, the top 10 reasons the Joey Reynolds show sucks. We have, if you want a meal, if you want him. Hey, listen, I got nothing but the 30 up in the head. No, don't do it, don't do it. No, we have a... Don't leave me alone with this man. We have number 10. Sucking long Reynolds family tradition. Number 9. Joey listeners have habit of not wearing dentures when calling in. Number 8. Concentritching about soaring prices of laxatives in Canada. Number 7. Nine out of ten doctors prefer Joey Reynolds show tonight. Number 6. Cast in sound of cold sore scraping against microphone. Number 5. Only radial personality in history to be upstage by Gilbert's. Number 4. Ratings too low to be measured with whole numbers. Number 3. Lengthy discussions of sex with the enthous. Number 2. Continually daydreams out loud, I could have been heraldo. And the number 1 reason of the Joey Reynolds show sucking is, slams some sexuality because of deep, deep, guilt over secretly wearing bra and panties on the air. There's room with Yenlake. And there they are. Yeah. There they are for your perusal and amusement ladies in gentlemen. Let's hear us from our live studio audience. No, no, no, no, no. We have some lay down comedians in here. Okay. The ones who just laid on in a quarter and go to sleep. One thing about Alex is show is he'll have a guy on and he'll say that is really funny. Yeah. And then for whatever reason whether Alex has got like too many people on the studio or whatever too many guests at one time. You'll never hear the guy say one thing. Yeah. Until at the end when he's getting ready to leave Alex will say, Well, thanks for coming. You're really funny guy. But you never had this, you know, it was never proven to you because you never get to hear. You know, stand up comedy. Our radio is kind of like doing bowling on radio. You know, that just misses something in a translate. Well, there's very few guys that can do that. There's very few stand up comics that translate well on radio. If I maybe we can have Rick we've come in and do a play by play on the stand up comedians. He's done bowling on radio. Ooh, look at that. A solid 10 pin. Well, listen, Neil, tell Alex and Eric. They would whatever they want about me. Just tell him to remember to say the call letters power and any six WPOW many times. Okay. Yeah. Two and then listen to this room crew there folks. Have a have a have a good day. Okay. Bye bye, Neil. Hi, boys. Wow. Okay. One 26 at WIOD is we continue with these really incredible calls putting together people, matching people up for love and happiness dear field. Yeah. Those guys are the worst. Wait one second now. Is this a mobile? No, Neil, but I've been home for a long time and come for Miami on the Palm Beach line. On your dime? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. Wait a minute. You don't mind, do you? Do you mind? Yeah. Okay. He says he doesn't mind but kind of grudging me. I think he's a little peo. I'll make it short and slow. Okay. When you're talking to the dead about the garbage in your yard, I got a great idea. You got to do from now on when you move to New Area like that. You got to interview everybody in the neighborhood and make sure that's where you want to live. Yeah. I mean, that's the bottom line. You got to interview with their like and what they don't like. What do you realize that you'd be living in a pup tent if you did that in this time. You never move any work as they all hate each other. Well, I mean, I'm not kidding man. My neighbors, they all and not just little stories. I mean, venomous stories like, I don't want to see your ugly face. I'm going to build a fence. They hate each other like poison. Well, that's true. Most of the stuff. Lord of but anyway, a friend of yours might even help you out. I got to have him talk to him a while. And who's that? He called me. Have. Yeah. Good luck to you. Have. Okay. Well, I'm sorry. You had to wait for that. That was depressing. Well, I don't do pets enough up here in their field. I would believe it. Oh, how these guys are putting me to sleep. Hmm. Who's that? Eric and the Mark. Mark and Eric. They're going on the road. They're taking it on the road together. Well, they should go on the road. As long as they take Alex with them. Just take your Alex. You're okay in our book. You're just a pain in the ass. Exactly. A grouchy grumpy old man. That's so that's basically the bottom line. Is a grumpy old guy? Well, what can you do? He doesn't have a sense of humor. He takes everything personally. And he starts attacking and leash it, lashing and leaching out. That's because he just started attacking ACN satire and songpairities. And then all those other interpret remarks he made that I won't even repeat. Yeah, that's all right. Yeah. Well, I just want to call Mitchell and George a couple of these back. Okay, sir. Okay. Third round. We got to your important call. 28 after one at WIO Day. We have an open line in Broward County, 524-9463-524-Dush. Davey. Davey? Neil. Yeah. Johnny Plyo, has you been in the studio? I thought maybe your horse ran off with the air for the, just with the, you for just a second. No, no, no. Yeah, he wasn't a studio but Tom Deniburg stepped on him. He's the same fellow that does the ship approved the, he was in the ship approved. Ship of fools. What the hell is that? He's a little harmonic player. He's about a hundred years old if he's still alive used to be with the harmonic cats. He was the play the mouth organ. I know. He used to be with ballerominivates. Yeah. The harmonic. Go around South Beach. No, no, no, the harmonic arrest goes. Yeah, the, the, the, the rascal house. Yeah, I'm on 60th. He used to stand online and play. I'm your first to shame online at the rest of the day. And by the way, women with the Andrew sisters. Oh, but that's the worst place. And they serve more views. You hear Henry Barrow on the news this morning and not a clock talking about Tommy Mercer. Yes, that's the same one. I used to sing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra. Here we're trying to get these young demographics. And Henry, of course, who's idea of the 90s is the 1890s or the G90s. It's a very important. Why, why, why, why? What is it? Did he have a little wine, you want to? Yeah, just a little bit. Yeah. But me while, uh, the, since talking about Alex been, been, if you had a way in talking now, I heard him on Saturday and I can't get rid of it. It's catching. Boy, but, but, but, but, but, but, but, yeah, that, that, that, that stammer. Yeah, it's catching. But, well, well, well, I don't know. It's catching. It's catching. Let's be a bit scared. Okay, 130. A WIOD. It's a wonderful Monday. What a great start for the week. Man. Everybody's full of hate and venom. This is what we like in this town. And that lady from New York. Well, I hope you get, you know, see, I don't know why I'm getting it. Cause I've had a lot of that. You know, not, I don't really give a damn on where the other. But it just her particular call bothered me because it was like. The whole point of her coming here was to turn on this show. I don't know about you, honey, but when I go on vacation. to think that there are better things to do than listen to the radio and call in talk shows and critique their in and that includes the people who call in who just think all over you too. It's the same thing. My God if you're on vacation, what in the hell are you doing listening to the radio at calling talk shows? What kind of a vacation is that? It's 131 at WIOD. I see fat riches in the building too just before we take our break. What did we do to deserve that? He held up something as he waddled by the window there. You know, come in. Could we get that lucky? We'll fight out. We'll be right back. Well, we usually don't do PSA's but this one has got so much good stuff written on the bottom. I can't resist. The city of Tamarack recreation division is hosting its fifth annual leprechaun 5k run this Saturday, March 24th at 8 a.m. The race fee is 8 bucks before March 24th, 12 bucks on the day of the race. The race is open to participants of all age groups. Race applications may be obtained at Tamarack Park 751 North University drive or call 722-2735. 722-2735 and on the bottom he says, since we're ripping everybody into building it, it says, PS, how the hell did Jim Mandage get a job in sports casting. He sucks. He sucks too. With notes like that at the bottom, I couldn't resist. Dave County, hello. Yeah, and he'll ride you. Hold on one second, sir. W-I-O-D. Yeah, you cut me off earlier.

Hello, all the cuties are coming on now. Yes. Hi. Neil, I'm the first time caller. Great. I'm a husband. Is such a meal right now? We're not visiting from New York, right? No, no, I'm a native. Good. I have been as such a love of your show. Hmm. And I'm worried about him now because I'm pregnant with our first child, and I'm home sick. Really? And I'm afraid that my child's going to be real strange because your show is real sick. Yeah, you probably run around as first word will be douchebag. Oh my god. Yeah. Unbelievable. Well, that'll make him a child prodigy. I don't think so. Probably beyond 60 minutes in the Mori Puppek and maybe even on inside addition. Clean your act up. It's awful. What? Gotta go back to work. You're so as making me sicker. Come on, come on. I'm serious. You love every second up. I don't. He's making me call you. What? He's got you like held hostage with the radio right up against your ear? Yeah, well, let me throw out the microphone. Come on. Come on. You can come out of the closet and admit you're enjoying every second of it. Have a great day. You too. And by the way, good luck to Neil Jr. Oh no. Oh no. I'm 36 at WIOD. Wouldn't be great. We have little kneelies all over town. It's we have it opening and date and bokeh and pombie. You're also open three open lines. Pretty suspect. And somebody else just hung up and date as we spoke. Look at that. Pretty weak, huh? On the heels of a pretty active Monday for this god forsaken town. Pretty weak. Boca. Sometimes you feel. Hold on. WIOD. See, I like to wait till I hear the click. Cause it adds a little ambience. Come on. Come on. Get off of there, man. That's 1.36, 24 till 2 at WIOD. Let's read the promo list. Okay. That should take about two seconds. Nothing on it. Nothing on it. The only thing I can tell you is that Larry Key is off. The only thing that can be heard by a Jim Boa Hannon is guest hosting and the guest will be Latisha Baldridge who explores proper behavior and Manor is boy. That is exciting radio. Okay, that's coming up 11 o'clock tonight. Larry Key and you show a Jim Boa Hannon. Proper Manor is an etiquette tonight. Okay. Pop a note. Put the hell is going on here all of a sudden. Are you there? Yeah. Okay. I need a little help and advice in my calling right place. No. Okay. Well, seriously. My daughter has been assigned to do a paper on the 26th anniversary of the Palm Pino race track over here and knowing you're such an avid fan over there. That we've sent a letter about two weeks ago and haven't got an answer. Don't listen. Listen. Okay. Have her call up Alan Finkelson. That's what I was after. He has been, I don't know, he's been there. I think since the day that they opened, he used to be up at Monticello. He's the public relations PR, whatever. I've heard him talk on your show. And Alan will give her all the information. He's got all the background. Anything and everything. And up information to fill volumes. Alan Finkelson. Okay. Right. Right at the track. He's here in the daytime till about three four o'clock. Okay. Now we're in the phone. Look for that. And pop a park. Yeah. Okay. Very good. Thank you. You bet. Okay. Twenty two till two. I'm going to go up there and bet 5000 a race and just go nuts. And a few believe that you are nuts. Palm Beach. Yeah. Alan Finkelson Jr. Hey Alan, how you doing? I just got in from last night. I believe that. I didn't know about it. Or about 1.38 little early today. I got a lot of work to tonight. And I just wanted to say, How that young girl calling. We loved it. You're beautiful. I love it. And I got to get ready to go tonight. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Get a couple of little nap in there. I'll never hurt anybody. Let's go to a mobile from Little Haiti. Hello. Hey, don't know. Okay. I'll tell you. You know, last week you're complaining about the neighbors. And not only are any good. But today. And how it's your buddy. You know, it's always something else. It is. I'll tell you. You got more complaints than my wife. And I'll tell you. I didn't think anybody got to do her. Yeah. Well, I'm working on it. I hear you. Okay. I'll tell you. Thank you. I'll tell you. What's the word? But sweet. 21 till 2 at W O D. What's all this? Sometimes. Didn't anyone. These are facts. Doesn't anyone tell Alex. But he was supposed to agree with you. And everything kiss your ass. Isn't that part of his job. Description. You're the professor. Or when Cory of Saplore. Or the world's greatest authority. Or something. Or something. Or something. Or something. So. Here's Washington's major mouth-bix thing on Larry King. And his good friends like Jesse Jackson and Louis Ferrican and Dan Quail and Heinrich Kimler and manual Noriega. Oh, God, give me a break. Well, you're quite wasting our paper on the facts machine. Pablo. From Pireen, my few, I'll spend it gives me ice. OK, let's try Hollywood, hello. Members, you'll be as? Yeah. And Roger, Bill Bear. From the Boston ruins. And the Bobby Perot. The back of you. And Jerry Chevers. Yeah, all the oldies are coming back. They're all out there, watering around on the ice. If Alex Bennett was so mad, how come they weren't fighting together on the phone, them, too? I don't know. I have no idea. I know. They're not mad. It's just for Alex's thin skin. And all you got to do is criticize. I don't have his little core of, see, the problem is, if you go by that theory, you could never criticize anybody. Because everybody is Alex's best friend. And he just had lunch with him a couple of weeks ago. And he's reciting something. And he was saying anything. I don't know. What is it? Mostly, they didn't even say anything bad. No. No, he did. It was make a little poke, a little fun at Lambert. And right away, Alex, and I'm not joking either. From what I am told through the rape fund, here, he just went nuts. He wanted to talk to him. And he can go blank himself and up his. And he sucks in any attack them on the air. And he's, I don't know. He's on the surface. He seems like kind of a laid-back guy, but underneath that wrinkled skin man, he's a very, is an emotional basket here. I think too much of that, what? I want to hear the dean. I never, I want to hear the dean. Forget it. You don't want to hear the dean, OK? I'd rather hear dead air for four hours than hear the dean, although it's not much difference. Have a good one. 141 at WIO, dean. We have an opening in Broward, 5249463, 524, Freakest. Crawl Gables. Oh, slow. Yes. This is the first time I've calling you and listen to you for around 12 years. Well, that's exciting, sir. Why don't we have this feeling in the pit of my stomach like a small butterfly? No, I'm just... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm going to... I'm just a little nervous. But nevertheless... Yeah, I just, uh, do you mind if I... Did you always use that voice on the phone or have you been working on it? No, it's my regular voice. No, it's not. It is. Whatever you say, we'll go along with it. Uh, uh, uh, do you mind if... Yes. Play something from... The past? Yes. Let's go to Miami. Hello. I'm going to the... Yeah. What was that? This guy just got strangled on his own phone. You believe that? Hollywood. Sometimes they think that I would expand it, suck some. Come on, get something original already. WIO? Oh, the same three or four puts is not there with the same material. I... Yeah, I could swear I heard the same thing yesterday. Same old, singing in the same old, belching, cut the crap. Will you pal? Boca. Hello. Yes. This is what Miami radio is like. Yes. Is this what it's coming to? All day long. All day. Was this the only station you receiver picks up, sir? What have you got a crystal set? It's not like this in New York. No, it's not in New York. It's not like this. It's much better. New York, they got Steve Kane. It's much better. Yeah. Talking with the urine lady. And how were? Definitely much better. But are lean fronches. I mean, just facing your senior wenshis. Yeah. Morning in the ground. Yeah, I said the air. Looking on the air. And who the hell is this Alex Bennett anyway? I don't know. Is he really that bad? Yeah. I think he should go back to Frisco. OK. 143, WIO, D. Hollywood. Yeah. Yeah. You're talking about you wanted to have a bunch of Nailies running around here in South Florida. No, I didn't say Nailies, sir. I said Nailies. Yeah. That's what what about artificial insemination? Yeah. Maybe you can get that lady to help you out. Good luck to you, sir. How are you doing? I'm doing great. I'm out here on the beach. Let's go. I think you need a lot of help to be honest with you. I could use them on the help. I bet. I'll be here to all three. OK. I'll see you there. Be over to give you helping hand. All right. Let's go to a browner. Hello. Colours. I need colors. I need colors. I want to go off my two pay. Let's try Del Rey. This ought to be a breath or fresh here. Hello. That was funny. Did it was? Yeah. I thought it was. OK. Well good. You'd probably like ACN2 and Mark Mosley. Are you kidding? That's stuff great. An Eric Lambert. Well, let's go overboard. That's all I had to say. Have a good day. And Jackie Mason. Bye. And Jackie Benny. And Jackie Stewart. North Miami. North Miami. Yeah. I got something original. Well, it's about to come. Yeah. It's got the world. Biggest there. So here's a mobile from Stewart. Hello. Stewart gone. Boy, they're just a while. All of a sudden, it's like we change gears. Let's try Tamarack. Touch my. Let's try Miami. Hello. Oh. Mm-hmm. David. Must be getting real close to two o'clock. Yes. Jack the balloon man. How are you? Jack the balloon man? Yeah, from spec. Another jack of all trades. How you been Jack? Good. Listen. I'm working the day down a youth fair of less few days. And I haven't caught you a show. And the few minutes I caught Friday. And today, what's happening to the call? What do you know about that? You know what happened? What do you mean by that? It was Friday. You were, uh, you weren't even taking calls. I was trying to call you for about a minute. So that wasn't Friday. That was Thursday. First day to you fair. Okay. And what happened with that? It was all music. Yeah, we had crank calls for it on a half and I was sick and tired of taking them. That's all. That's the best. Just like we had less to 10, 15 minutes here, okay? You know, they think that they're bothering your show, but they're not to just annoying your loyal listeners. Because. Well, life goes on Jack. That's, uh, you know. That's Trilbo Sten. Nice on us. The room of the thing that you've got with your audience. And for some of those pinheads out there to think that they're the ones that control the show. For every one of those pinheads that call up their thousands of us who are working to do and they're just listening and drawing you who can't get to the fall. And they're not going to ruin our good time. Well, there's definitely something wrong with people who call talk shows. There's no question about that. That's right. And I mean, Jack. You're to a test to that. That's for sure. What do you have a good one, Jack? You're to an okay. 146 to Wiod. We're going to look at that fat wall. He just the watered on the hall. Man, he says, Big is my Vasubius. And they got he's if he gets any bigger. They're going to have to win. Not the walls apart. Aren't they? And then look who's right behind them. Oh, God. I feel so skinny all of a sudden. I mean, fat rich and big walley. They're back to back. Look at that. God. All right. I'm going to spray care so we can get some of these important calls on. One 49 at Wiod. What is that? El Capitan. What the hell is that? Hello. Hello. It's El Capitan Dave. Well, my name's several of the air, water. Your music way. Where are you? I was on my way to see and say hi before I left. And this happened Friday too. I'm not an odd. I'm not another one of these deals. You always pull this. I was on my way in in my car. I got high jet before. I'm going down the street. But I'm still like 10 or 15 minutes away. So there was no way. So I forgot to call and say hey. Well, you're coming over here. I was going to see. Why don't we go have some lunch? Let's go maybe 12 a few Bruce keys and talk about old. No, I'm not going to cough no Bruce keys. I don't know one of those. That's Henry Barrow. You're thinking about it. It's so weird to be down here as a tourist instead of a regular human being. Well, you know how it's stern. I'll tell you that. So there. And I'm driving this car with a huge hurt slice and it's played on the front. And people are like giving me the finger. Exactly. That's because they were recognized here. Number one from the Zeta Morning Show. So if you talk to our mutual friend at Lakeland at all and see. Oh, as a matter of fact, I got this really depressing message on my hand and I was just going to say, I'm going back to Lakeland, I guess. Maybe see Lickers. Yeah. Well, he's going to laugh in the background while everybody's getting drunk up there. It ought to be fun. But the day that he left me and they heard about it, I was getting all these factors and phone calls. I've been Seattle people spending their money. Sending the newspaper article. Well, come on down to Wild. Well, come on down to Wild if I'll wait around and then you can be after you come back. You can be part of Alex's live studio audience. We see I didn't want to say, but that's why the whole thing coming down here was to be part of his final show. Yeah. Well, unfortunately, we keep having another one. We keep waiting for it, but he keeps coming back every week. And when he has another one, I'll come back down. Yeah. Well, you know, we remember that ACN stuff. A sucked even back on Zeta was there. Right. That was pathetic. And at Mark Moser, he's a piece of crap. There were some, there's like a tiny handful that were in classic. Oh, it's just a joke. See, now you're getting sucked into it. When you're agreeing with me, oh, God. Oh, Capriita, you're just a wreck. You really are. Well, whatever you say, they do suck. They're bad. It's bad stuff. I'm sorry. We haven't got it. Well, that's how it all means. Yeah. Alex, see doesn't know his elbow from his ball to head. He's in with boy, Gary now, polishing his head before he's going on the air today. Just. Well, let's use a soap. He's a soap. He's a soap. No, I tell you where we'll go. Let's go up to the unicorn. Oh, the new one. Yeah, it's great. How are they? They sell meat there now. No, they don't sell meat. That's what somebody told me. No, they don't. They mean they don't have like, fried pork sandwiches or something. Somebody told me that they started cooking meat there now. They were talking about pork salad, Annie. They were talking about the record. They heard on the jukebox. Boy, you are. You're just a mess. Being in Seattle must have done you in. So what are you doing down here? I had to get away from the rain. I got, um, I got your message on my machine, but it was real late. I don't remember when it was. And you didn't leave any, uh, instructions or information or anything. It's like typical. Well, because I've just been like sleeping on bus benches this week. Well, that's good. That's good. It's a pretty pretty fatty, but there's a lot to rain. A lot to rain. Well, bring some down here. We're desperate for it. It's been raining since November. Where are you? Are you in, are you on a pay phone? I don't know. This is a girl. What do you mean you don't know? What do you mean you don't know? I'm at, um, said, well, if I say it, and people are going to come. Oh, I don't mean the location. I mean, are you're like, not in transit. You're like, uh, I'll be there and I'll, let me get some gas. And, uh, I'll be there. We got a lot of that here. I'll, I'll be there in 10 minutes. You want some gas? We could fill up your whole tank for it. Okay. All right. We'll see you. Get them off the phone to get them on the road. The longer he talks, the longer we're going to have to sit around here. I'll sit in Alex's live studio audience. No, I don't think he's going to come in here. What I'm here today, do. I notice he's not in here yet. I don't, I don't like this. He's Steven. I, I, the audience, don't understand. Steven, I hate that each other like poison for years. Okay. But when, when I came to work here, we both kind of put that aside. And yeah, we took a lot of shots at each other, and ribbed each other. But we, we really did. We got along well. I know most of you don't believe that, but we did. But I just can't strike up any kind of, um, anything with this man. I mean, this guy is just the most bizarre, uh, case I have ever run into in my life. He's just no way to, I don't know. I just don't understand it. And I've promowed and I've tried and I've pushed up. I've spent half of my show plugging all these stiff guests every day. And I don't know what the hell to, I don't know what the screamer eat of banana. And I know they're going to start getting, ah, there he goes. He's sabotaging, there he goes. Doesn't to everybody we told you. I mean, you know what the calls are going to be today. Guarantee these old bags. Oh, there we, we warned you. He's just been waiting to have the opportunity to stay. He doesn't to everybody else. You just watch all that mumbot jumbo on that. Right. You know, that's going to be Miami. Uh-huh. Right. Is that it? Oh, God. Pembroke Pines, hello. Hey, do you think Captain Dave might be in town looking for Alex's job? I don't know. I don't know. I'll find out. I'll give you a full report tomorrow. Yeah. What was all that kissing make-up crap going on with Eric and Mark? I'm on Charles. Eric Mark, I just whipped out. You know, he was just sucking around. I don't know what that was all about. I don't know idea. Or is he embarrassing? I'd say what would Alex say. It would have been a lot more fun if they would have been, it would have been a lot more fun if they would have been like, but they would also have been a lot more fun if they would have been like, you know, like, they would have been a little more, yeah. Like, yes. What? Yeah. Yeah, that would have been a little more fun. Yeah. Yeah. What Alex still realizes, most entertaining part of the show is, just listen to him, get up elaptic when someone tells him he sucks. I mean, that's about it. That's his show. about this. I don't claim to be the beginning and end all on anything, but this man whether it's music, whether it's movies, whether it's food, whether it's comedy, it's like, hey, this is the definitive answer and that's it. I mean, this is where it's at. This is the cutting edge and this is what's hip and this is what's, I just, I just drives me nuts. That's what's the crop. All right, you know, I'll see you. Let me just tell you, let me go, where you should do it. Okay. Okay. Good luck to you, sir. We got like four, stinking calls here with two minutes to go and you know, they're only going to be four seconds of peace for Lauderdale. See, no seconds. Plantation. Oh, yeah, I just like to stick up for Alex, I think he has a dynamite show. But how come you've got that voice? What's that voice? You're a new man. I was wrong, Shane, John. What is that? My normal voice. Come on. I know you live in Plantation. No, I understand. Right, but anyway, really, we're kidding. It's not used to listen to, uh, yes, to Alex up into York. I think he's great. I don't know why you always down on it. I just form that. He knows everything. That's just what he's been always been like. Oh, does he knows everything? Does he know everything? Nobody knows everything. Oh, but he's, you know, does he know anything? I thought, is that a difficult question, sir? Well, it's not that, yes, he knows something. Oh, he knows his thing. He's got a good audience. He knows his thing. Oh, yeah, I mean, he's waiting to going to be high. Well, I hope so. I hope they're astronomical. I hope he gets a six sure. I hope he gets the highest numbers of the station. All right. Well, I know one other thing, too. You're going to admit to. Yes. I know you really did the guy in your life. But you do it. This is your promo firm. No, it's not. No, it has been up until the day. But after the age, I went nuts with the ACN thing. I mean, that's, I mean, he's entitled to an opinion, but God Almighty, the station pays thousands of dollars a year for it. And it's funny stuff. And it's, uh, I don't get it. I just, I mean, what is funny? What is funny? Is it funny having people that nobody ever heard of before sitting in here going, what is that? Is that funny? Miami Lakes. Do I have to get a little hysterical here? I don't know. But if you read the hero today, the living today section. Yes, sir. With the Malcolm Forbes article. Yes, a little gay witch hunt from the hero. Oh, really? Oh, yeah. Alex Bennett's own San Francisco Chronicle article on storm erupts Wow. Is that a big secret? Yeah. Well, they go into Picasso, be in gay and divinity, be in gay. And Michael Angelo. And Michael Angelo. Yeah. And Raymond Burr and all these other people. And everyone, hey, one quick thing, uh, Joseph Gackie, a new unbasedball. Yes. He's the Gordon Soli of baseball. He's pathetic. The worst play by play I've ever heard my life. Some Nambulant is the word you're looking for. Yeah. Some Nambulant. Go cups. Okay. Well, that's quite an ending. Do quite a day here ladies and gentlemen. Now we're going to, uh, I can just, uh, you just feel it already in the minimize stomach. But I don't care because I'm not going to hear it anymore. I'm going to be having lunch with Capriita. And we're just going to have a wonderful time reminiscing about those great days in Zeta with real program directors like Peter Bolzer, who are real red suspenders, not not make believe Spandex suspenders. Okay. Oh, and then at line about Barry Mantelow and how they're calling him a fairy. Did you hear that? And I, oh god, almighty. I just, I could just go completely up a play. I could just take over the whole station now and not leave the room. But that would be wrong. Okay. Chuck Meyer standing by with the two o'clock Wiod News. Chuck of course looks upon his all very philosophically as long as they give him that paycheck. He doesn't give a damn about any of it. And then of course the Alex Benucho a 205 sports talk would Joe Zagaki to give it a little mid evening nap at 605 and the stand made your show from 8 to 11. Have a wonderful day. We'll be back to RIP some more people tomorrow morning at 10. Here on 610 Wio RIP.
