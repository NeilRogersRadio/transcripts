We need a call today. We'll take a couple here in there. But boy, this article by Ken Roderigas in a hero this morning. I didn't pay for the beer. The most stupid article I think I've ever seen and said that's covering a lot of ground in the hero. Goldberg makes night of it. Talk host gives up security for more wheeling free wheeling format and we'll get to that minute. Speaking of sports, I must say, and I say it with Shagrin with Agan my face because we, you know, when you're in this town, you get had over and over and this hockey thing. They had the press conference finally yesterday afternoon and all of a sudden, the guy who was supposed to be the big financial backer was supposed to have backed out the night before now he's back in. It's the old in and out if we can say that. And God, for you, now he's belly aching about, well, the only problem is we've only got a little under 5,000 season tickets all. But he had a little under 5,000 tickets all shortly after the game here that whipped up all the enthusiasm. We all got excited and excited sent into money and then we're sitting and waiting. And if he thinks in these next three weeks, they're going to get another 6,000 people to send in money for season tickets. They're nuts because the credibility factor at this point is minus infinity. So if the national hockey league decides to give us a franchise, it ain't going to be because of God if we wouldn't this group of mysterious in a closet people, it'll be a miracle. Okay. We're a steal the name from the baseball team up there from Mike Beck. We had to call him the Miami Miracle because that's what it'll be if we get the hockey team. I have, well, I shouldn't say I've never because I've seen it over and over and over again in this town. All of this time in the beginning. It appeared that just maybe they had their crap together and that we had the game and it went off. I mean, we had some ice problems but nonetheless, we packed the arena. It was great. Everybody was enthused. And now you just have that feeling that you've been had again. You know what I mean, Mr. Wood, God free. Never trust a guy named God free, especially on Miami Beach. Anyway, Hank Goldberg, as you know, in fact Randy Martin's last show tonight. Can you handle it? Can you handle one more? No. Come on. You can handle one more three hours show. Oh, no. Not Randy Martin again. Randy left me a check for Kamala's house this morning. Two late to start sucking around now. But thank you Randy. Now, seriously, Bernie, the heat mass got in the Miami maniac. The hurricane mass got going to be here. Guest and I wonder what they're going to be doing with Randy. Eight to eleven tonight is kind of a big send off. At Hank starts. Now, Monday night, we have Monday night, feet ball, which just happens to be the dolphin radar game. And then Tuesday starts the Hank Goldberg show eight to eleven. Now, this Ken Rodder, Rod, I can't say it after a day. Can you say it after a day? Rod, I can't do it. See, I just don't my tongue isn't shaped that way. I have to eat a piece of olive offer to do it. Anyway, Ken Rod Riggas writes this stupid sports on a year column in the Harold, pretends you know something about the broadcasting. Can, what you know about radio, I'd say he and boy Gary are right on the same par. That lighter is not going to work George. It's dead. It's kind of like the Randy Martin show. It's not going to work. You can shake it and you can quake it. It's history. You know what we need in this and look at that, Eliana's wearing suspenders today. Boy is she officially in that programming department now or what? Wow. It's the boy Gary syndrome. Wild Georgia's fiddling with his lighter. Hello. Yeah. Hello. Hold on. Anyway, what we got a bunch of calls on there, but we're not ready yet. We'll get to you. Just relax. You're not going anywhere on a Friday. 25,000, six, 85 for Camilla sounds. That's incredible. Three years ago, our total in two and a half months, I think, was about 10 grand. In two and a half months, when we get the mail today, it'll mean at the end of the day, it'll be two full weeks and will be close to $30,000. And the most amazing part about what you folks are doing is that we're in a recession folks just ask anybody in retail and they're all dying out there. They're there's crying and just have it a fit. Nobody's buying houses. Nobody's buying cars. Nobody's going to fancy restaurants. Nobody because everybody's in a panic. And a price of oil has gone through the roof. And the Arabs are looking at the dollars down up nine points now, but kind of sliding from that good start. People are just petrified. And in spite of that, people are really shaking at loose with the dollars for Camilla sounds and the homeless this year and that's great. I'm sure Rush Limbaugh wouldn't be proud of it, but screw him right. Anyway, getting back to this column, I'm tempted to read it. It'll take a minute or two, but we've got all these damn calls on there. South Miami. Deal. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. Or ready leaving, huh? Well, she says she's not really leaving. She's going to be hanging around the station out of what that means. Oh, kick her out of there. Maybe she can be a Dumburto's assistant. Sting, carrier, the desert, man. Don't give her a message. All right. Now, he's going to replace her. What do you mean, who's going to replace? Where have you been? Are you like an ostrich? Is your head been buried in the sand, sir? Impossible. Chubby Hank Goldberg is going to replace her eight to 11. Start. I just got through sand that's starting Tuesday night. I didn't pay for the beer. Hank Goldberg. Right. Oh, my goodness. Bring back how much better. No, just kidding. Just fooling. This sounds like, you know, this sounds like to me. I'm afraid. Super Dave. No, no, no, no. Yeah, it is. No, it's not. Super Dave. No, let's take a pull hold on second. Is it super Dave? Hello. He's not even here. Hello. It's super Dave. Hold on. Okay. What do you think? I think it's super Dave. Okay. What do you think? I don't know. Okay. And you? I think it's super Dave. And you? Where is the big douchebag? Okay. And what about you? He a teen. You've had it, pal. No, no, no. You're pissed. It's super Dave. It's not super Dave. I bet you hang around with Gail Garten in the newsroom. That's out in the background. Who? Big Gown? Big Gown. It wants to be a radio station person. This is super Dave. Get out of here. 21 after 10 at WIOD. Our audience is a lot sharper than I am. I'll tell you that. They know you like poison man. One, one, say, God will come to me. By the way, if you need a good 22nd car Roger, go for your right ear. He'll enable off that sucker. All right, Rick, calm down. Rick Sanchez is really doing it. Anyway, he said he's bringing a check over for Camilla's house today. So let's get the end by the way, somebody from Channel 7 spoke to me this morning. She was very pleasant and bubbly and effervescent. I guess we're going to change their altitude in a hurry. 10, 27. Okay, I got to get to this article. What? What was the deal there? I don't understand it. After all, at brilliant stuff, you've been to WIOD sooner or later. We all hit like a little vacuum. What? Well, this without a wrench, you don't have a wrench. You got to give you some pads on the wheels. Oh, I see, okay. Get it out of here. Put it in the desert. Anyway, where you know what this is. Yeah, it's our chance of a lifetime. All right, we have an open line of day. I'm not taking too many of these calls, but boy, it'll be a lot of fun being on hold. Anyway, Goldberg makes tonight a bit of it. Right, right. I just can't do it. Rod Riggas. Well, I'm sorry, okay. Maybe I don't need enough black beans and rice and not into that crap. I don't just human eat and anything we bring in here. He's not Mr. Chusey and there, Mr. Professional Cuban in the control room. Anyway, talk host gives up security for free-wheeling format. This is the most stupid bunch of crap. First of all, Hank Goldberg works for Bieber Silverstein. He's got more money than God. He makes more money. It's a track every week than most of us making a damn lifetime. I paid for the beer. Exactly. And he writes this article as though Hank has been making a living. His whole life is dependent on doing a couple nights week on it. Incipit stupid sports talks, you'll already talk about his The Dolphins and Hurricanes and Ignore all the real sports. Anyway, the bombastic voice booming out of your WOD sports talk radio dial has been silenced. He writes, outrage is gone. And with a stream of sarcasm, cynicism, one-liners and double on tons. I paid for the beer. Hank Goldberg, yaps, no more between six and eight p.m. beginning Tuesday he Yaps from 8 to 11 p.m. on his own show, Goldberg at night. Now wait to listen to this. What this means for listeners of South Florida's highest rated sports talk radio show is a gentler-friendly or less controversial program. What this means for callers is less provocation. Is this guy nuts? A kinder, gentler, Hank Goldberg? This man's nuts. I paid for the beer. Boy. And it goes on and on and on. It says the loss of Goldberg's outfloor does most compelling sports radio personality will hurt but sports talk will survive. And it alters the line up slightly and it goes on to this big thing about Joseph Gackie who went to Boy Gere and recommended that Hank do eight to 11 at night trying to get. Because Joe wants him off that sports show. That's obvious. He's tired of being shown up and it even goes in here. It says, is a Gackie and Goldberg are fast friends, but sometimes there wasn't enough room on the show for both of them. I thought sometimes I hindered Hank, got in his ways of Gackie, he said sometimes he can be very domineering. There were times where he would take over the whole show and the worst thing you can do is get in the way of it. I think Hank is going to strong enough to carry the ship at night. I think he's going to be magnificent. And a couple of other quotes in here too about how the, where's that other quote? Oh yeah, he says, we're going to have content. We'll be stronger than ever, Zagaki says to people tune in for content or style. You're full of crap, Joe. They like Hank. They think you're boring. And then the guy goes on and on about sports talk and he's tremendous ratings in about the highest rated sports talk show. I mean sports talk gets like threes, okay. Once in a while, I'm not going to afford it. They get like threes. No problem. Anyway. Well, listen, I'm under a lot of pressure here today. I just don't understand this. And then he goes on to say, the move is a gamble for Goldberg. This is the part I love. He leaves the security of the market's highest rated sports talk show for a slot in the dark. I didn't pay for the beer. A three hour period that you had average of only 60 and 100 listeners, 12 and older per quarter hour in the latest ratings book, Sports Talk do an average of 12,400 per quarter hour from 6 to 8 pm. Woo, boy. We'll be big deal. I mean sports talk in this market is a limited thing. Okay. This is just not a sports town. And Hank's still going to be talking sports. And person I was going to bring on some real heavy hitters like Wayne Newton. And the people like that. I mean, this is just dumb, dumb. And of course, the fact that he's taken over a slot that's been dying over here means he's got to improve it. And what is the big deal in addition to which it's still like all I mean, the guy's on channel four. He's on the dolphin games. He's over there. Bebrew Silverstein. He's over the track making 10, 20,000 every five races. What the hell is this guy talking about? Giving up the security of the sports of the markets number one sports talk show for a shot in the dark. Shoot this can. But you know about radio. This guy knows about as much about radio as Bill Marshall. Wash your misdeme, don't you? You know, it's how we've been flooded with call since they left. Joey and Bill. We've been flooded. The switchboard is lighting up like a Hanukkah bushing heat. We want Joey back. And of course, it's been rust or waste. It's an all the people at the ed team just to make those lines go nuts. I wish they had some work to do over there. Okay. Let's take a call from POMCITY. Yeah. What did you do? Give Joey one of those maps? Yeah. In fact, he's in Saudi Arabia right now. He's that's a good place for him. Yeah. So anyway. Anyway, I have the unfortunate. Even this guy sounds like super Dave now too, don't he? Not me. I think it's a disease. I think this is worse than Kenosho and Sappalitis. I had the misfortune of hearing Mr. Lee Fowler yesterday. Oh my god. Talk about sticking in the desert. Talk about a pig report. Man. Topic of conversation was once Steve Kane. Oh, I wonder why those two are joined at the lip. Well, he said that Kane used to work for him. And he's on a downslot. Slide of his career. I guess Kane was ripping him the other day. Yeah. Well, listen, he can't get any contrap controversy going with us. So now he's got to do with his buddy Lee. All it like I said, the word for the day airsots. Things are not what they appear to be, sir. Have you ever seen Steve and Lee together with Millie Vanille? Yeah, I think they were the ones that did the... They did the records. That's right. Good job, too, by the way. Have a great day. 1033 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward 524 and one in Palm Beach where we already had that Scyndelating exciting caller you just heard on there. Almost put us into a coma. 59463. 655 WIOD. Now what do you people listen to sports talk for? You listen for the contender for the personality for the style. I don't come any better than Neil Rogers or any fighter and Hank Goldberg. Right in paper to beer. Ooooo! Some friends in mind they say have done a big flip flop. Said no new taxes if I made it to the top. Well, change the mind. Depth of sick roads every day. Here's what we need. Everybody has to pay. That's why we pay. O'Gell we pay. Pay. We got to pay just to make it today. That's why we pay. O'Gell we pay. We got to pay just to make it today. Scyndel who's saying things he can do whatever he wants. And busing his chops costs more than I thought. Now read my hips isn't afraid I should say. Election day come 92 and that's when I'll pay. Election day. Come 92, I'll never make it this way. That's what they say. Right. Right. I ain't got a prayer. I'm outta here. That's my way. That's only pray. Okay. 1107. And W. That's my seat.

You have a door a tape of Andrew Dyskley saying, Unbelievable. Well, wait, roll it. Don't be talking about my good friend Neil Rogers like that. Oh. When they roll against the Seth Catcher-Warm Blazers. Yeah. They play a tape of Andrew Dyskley and out of the guy at the top says they can no longer do it. Oh. So he's out. Wow. And unbelievable. So what kind of a world is this anyway? This is the Octa care man. Oh yeah. How you doing? How's your ears? There's a little waxy buildup. I came across Simon and Garfunkle yesterday on the radio for the 400th time. You know, the thing of it is I like Simon and Garfunkle, but after the first 2000 times the siege, it gets a little old. Yeah. I found together back in 68, just the two of them in one guitar. They were just trying to... They're great. Yeah. But I've never seen our Garfunkle in the, one of the hotels out in Omaha when you were doing the college world series. I know. And we do all this construction in the hotel. There's been out of shape and psychotic and curing on and rightfully so by the way. I guess old friends, you know. Yeah. But how about that millie's anilion? That's something. Earzots, pal. Nothing. There's what you think it is. Okay. They got to give that Grammy back. It's really Dave Gamin Debbie Ellister the music to that. They couldn't get him into studio for the, no, they couldn't get him into studio for the video. So they had to get a couple of people smaller. Unbelievable. Yes, sir. That's what the, the dice band would say. Oh, the Neil. I 75. And right at 136th Street. Yeah. It just ends there. You just get off and just go east. Really? Simple. I thought it was 138th. Well, it ends like. It's like, Ratney or good technique. It turns into 138th. Huh? Well, about like magic. You're on it. And all of a sudden, you, it's like 163 turns into 167. No, 136 turns into 100. It's like 49th Street in the highly is 103rd. You know, you people over there in high alley and Miami lakes. You're so screwed up. You know what's going on? Yeah. Well, it's a name's very street Justin Case. They figure a lot of might be right. I got the map right here and you should be okay if you just go right to the end. You got the map? Yep. Well, we got Randy Martin over here. Let's make a deal. Have a great day, pal. All right. Talk to you later. North Miami. The other day, I called and got chewed out by you because I asked you about your separation from your wife. I didn't get chewed out. I didn't get chewed out. Yeah. I thought I had to talk to where to. Okay. Now, I would like to put my two minutes for it. Think about the disruption from you. Okay. I'll be the judge of that. And since I got the can't stand a heat for that, the kids. I'm amazed by your grief. You're living in the space where I'm in Miami. The ambling, catching bitch, chicks. Never, now hold on. Stop. Never did that. So you start off wrong. It's good night. Ha ha ha. It'll be rough. Oh, man. Oh, God. Never gambled. Never passed a bad check. Never told a lie. No wonder he's got that panokino. Look at that. Oh, man. They got two cameras now on Larry. Just to keep track of that nose. It's grown so long. Unbelievable. You can't stand the heat, girl. The kitchen. That's what I always said. Wow. You notice how he sends him on their way real fast? I mean, like, bingo. Can't a day when they are, KELOW. So vester, Solone. Strap an on a guitar instead of an automatic weapon. It's the rolling stones. We're not blowing you up. We're not blowing you up by just a storm. We're rolling stone. I know. I'm only rock-y-mobble, but a lot, girl. Who are the most millions? The music that goes now. A million. Here it comes. Here comes my night, she's rock-y-mobly. Here comes my night, she's rock-y-mobly. Here comes my night, she's rock-y-mobly. Oh man. Rocky parts 500 this weekend, right? Which goes to show you the Dumbledore Day's, the bigger smash it is. Just look at the Rick and Sud Show to this afternoon. Holleywood. Hello. Oh, you're there. How are you doing? Okay. This is Adam from Miramar. Boy, you're a little slow on the uptake today, Adam? You got that in the hoof, but I don't know. I had to click over and call a friend and see what was happening. Well, what was happening? Well, nothing much. Okay. I just a basket full of material today. Yeah, a basket full? Yeah. I was listening to that. I'm not touching that line, Adam. I was listening to Larry last night, now. I heard that. The Marvin was over there in Miramar. Stickin' things. We'll go ahead, I'm sorry. And I heard the section on OpenFone as America that the call was played earlier. Yeah. And I almost fell off. That was the best. We got to have that on tape. I mean, when I read both his books and he just said, never did that. Never did that. He says in his books that he had gambling problems. You know, that he was bankrupt and had to delete him. And now I'll just say that he didn't do it. And remember to do it that. Oh, it's just a... Can I make you complain? Yeah. You know how late at night, Lith and Kyle, he used to hear those promos of the brinieri and yourself and reconciled. Yeah. What happened? What happened? I don't hear of anymore. I have no idea. I'm not exactly listening to IOD at those hours of night. You know what? Well, I think I don't leave. I have our time sleeping, so I have to... Do you? Why is that? I don't know. I guess that worked too hard. He can have what you know. I've got the new job at Service Merchant. Yes, sir. How's it going? It's okay. I'm listening to you while I'm there. And I'm off the day. But yesterday I had you playing and the slater came up. She's about 80. And who is that? I've asked Neil Rogers. Oh, why does he talk that way? I would listen to him for a second. Yeah, right. And then my manager comes up and says, Well, we're sorry about that, man. This is the official radio station of Service Merchant. He almost fell out of her chair. Outstanding. It was something else. But I'll stick her in my outside eye and give her some soup. And don't give her a map. Right. But I'm listening to all my donations coming in for a criminal assault. Great. I got your letter that you sent me in the mail and it was okay. Yeah. Why? Why? Why are you watching that landing? No, I was not watching. Well, I was thinking about how glad I was that I was missing it. Okay. I was watching my first just like a movie. What? Yeah. Oh, man. No wonder he couldn't sleep all night. And let me tell you that a myth, let me give you a name. Fresh, well, poppy on. Yeah. He's got unescalate. 86. And a half. Mm-hmm. Well, I'd have to measure that closely. And, uh, well, that's something I think about. Oh, yeah. Okay. Probably brings back some memories from the movie. Let me ask the question. Yes. I had to max anything you like. The movie that you were talking about. What was it? The name of it? Network? Network. You haven't seen it. I mean, you act like, uh, Well, I was 19. Without 15 years ago, give me a break, no. Network? Yeah. Your life is meaningless until you've seen that work. Well, I read the date alone. For, this has got nothing to do with that. Will you forget about your strike of her just a minute? It's got nothing to do. I'm telling you, you must see network. Okay. I'm going to go out to the end of the day. The entire world, all the truth of the world is right there in that movie. Okay. See, can you show fun? I'd like something I can watch around the family. Like what? I'll make him watch with the family. With the family? Yeah. Well, I mean, it's not a porno movie, but I mean, it's got some, uh, it's got some language in it, but it's great. Okay. Nothing they haven't said to you probably last couple of days. Yeah. Oh, and you know what that, that, uh, the couple got killed a few days ago. You know, it's right out the street from where I live? It's like I can throw rock there from there. Well, that's very depressing, Adam. Well, it is, but I just thought you'd want to know. No, I don't want to know. It's depressing. Well, it is. But, um, Adam. Yes, sir. Put you up. Hey, can you give me another book? Last time I taught to you, you gave me the date alone book. And I read it. So give me another book to read. Go out and get them. We'll be network first. Okay. One thing at a time. Go out this weekend. We're getting that work. Call us on Monday and give us a report. Well, after he said one thing at a time. Okay. Have a good day. See you. Oh, don't, don't, don't, don't. Turn on the music. Turn on the news. Turn on the sports and weather. All the different views. They'll help you through the traffic. Share a smile or two. Pop to call those driving home with you everyday. Pop to call those driving home on some place special. W-I-O-D. W-I-O-D. What do you want? Oh! Hey, do I need? Well, what a greeting that was, Alex. Well, is this, uh, this is an all-emount. Is it? Hey, I bought those maybe leaves, eh? You got it all sorted? Wow. What we did a big day yesterday. What is it? I bought those big leaves, eh? Yeah, they're hot. They're at Detroit tonight. They're playing the red wing. Wow. Kind of a mediocre amount of mail today. I would say, although this can't be all of it. Any of you, too bad. We're going to call up that tape finally. Did I sent you? What tape? What tape? It's still in the cupboard. Just relax. Just to why what are you going to do with it, shallot? Shallot? You and Rick Sanchez together. Well, wouldn't that be, can you just hear that? Yeah, I'd be great with that. Alex, Junior and Rick Sanchez singing. Driving. Oh, God. Oh, we can sing. Oh, we can sing. Oh, all are. Are you doing the tenor clock news, you know? You just sit on top of that table there. Oh, man, I can't handle it. Just too emotional for me. I heard what this name liked. The only Donald Trump. Did you see network? Yes. Oh, boy. Clark Sanchez on that. Who hasn't? And Great movie. What are the greatest along with the guy? He might, my window right now, and screaming. Yeah. I'm at his hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore. Well, he said something else over the air, which I won't repeat. But yeah, he said crap. Right. Or something like that. Yeah. He said life is bull crap. Right. With the net. Right. Boy, that's what he said. That's what he said. The Superman. Life is bull crap with an ass. And he looked down on his chest. He said, hey, you're right. Hey. Okay, Neil. That's it. I have no moment. The Captain Marvel was Canadian. Woody has said, she's M.A. Wait. See ya. 1243. All right. Now I know I played that whole other cup, but as long as I found the CD today, and I found it, but I kind of like dug it out. Can we hear like little bits and pieces of some of these other cuts? Because we haven't heard that you're Frankie the deon stuff. And I'm very, very long time. In fact, so long, easy to step on of here. I think I haven't come to long. I'm going to start kind of back off on it. Creepy and a bit of red color. I'm taking this home. I'm going to steal your notes. Right. It's the plant lady. Hey, here she is. She's ready to win that 30 million and a lot of read this weekend. Love me ask you a question. If you win the 30 million, will we ever see you again? Yes. Really? One last time. She's going to do something wicked on those plants at one last time. And then she'll take off for never to be seen again. Hop it out. Who's the clicking line? I love it. Like I said. I'm not a kid. Oh, I tell you one thing about John Hamburg at Channel 6. He has excellent taste. Not only does he sit next to Giselle Fernandez, put big shorts on the news every night. But he loved this album. And actually, grace this with a call. I wonder how many people remember that. Well, we're playing this in Hamburg called in was blown away. And when out with his own hearted bucks, he only makes what two-three million a year and bought his own copy of it. What a guy. Like I said. We're going to dance on the door. We have to go long time. Choose the size that killed the case. He will be in back to see those kids. We're not a son we want. Okay, he's no brick Sanchez, but he's okay in our book. Let's take a call from Vegas. Oh, I knew. You're in Vegas? Yeah, I'm on the other line calling back. I'm on both lines now. I want. What did it call back what? I'm going to hang up on that one. I was on home here for a while. I didn't know if you got to me. Okay, we got to you right now. Sir, a great American in Vegas and a real living in breathing and shaking and quaking places. He's doing it. You got it, but it was great here. Where were you standing? I'm standing right now outside. I'm not aware you know, now where you're standing. Where you stand? Oh, I'm standing at the morage. At the morage where you're standing. I'm standing at the payphone outside the hill. Wow. So how's the morage? How is the morage? The morage is beautiful. They had to volcano last night.

If not more, because there's plenty people who make more money to me. Of course, I only sell selling. By the way, speaking of that, I was at Papadau Park last night. And nobody brought me over any checks for many of the other horsemen. Kelly Shepherd who's got a perfect season going over 44 was able to come up with a $50 check.

I said, hey, I'm cheap. I'll take it. That's right. He knows what all the money that I've even had placed. The least they can do is let me park for free. You know what? They're building a whole new new Rogers Memorial Wing on that track. That's right. I'm trying to turn. I'm trying to turn. I'm trying to turn. I'm trying to turn. At least. What a guy. Great.

Well, what the hell does that mean? He's going to be like, well, uh, hey, probably came on the saw grass. He don't know a one road from another. And probably came on a federal highway. Well, they're, uh, they're what? They're kind of kind of gone. Like, there's, well, there's a one that says 45 and then about 100 yards after that. So it's like, I said, so there's still a couple of them up. But I, but who cares? Hey, you can always say, hey, I didn't see that one. I see this one right here. And a pig will say, hey, see this.
