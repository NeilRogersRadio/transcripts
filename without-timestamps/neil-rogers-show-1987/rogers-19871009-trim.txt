The media is sick and it's not badly. Don't leave me alone. Don't leave me alone. What's Gary Hart doing tonight? And hiring minds wants to know. That's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero. Is Maurice Farey really having sex with an alien from outer space? It's on the head. He's probably hawking the true mother of the elephant man. It's in the head. He's John Kennedy sleeping with Max Hibber. It's in the head. The hero. Is Tim Baker about to get birth to Jerry Falwell, baby? It's in the hero. Sex, sex, sex, more. Hot, sex, all is in the hero. What's Gary Hart's amazing race, diet from Florida? A crossword puzzle that has no answer. Our own public opinion is just for us. I post no letters to Neil Rogers. And we're so sorry, Uncle Albert, but we haven't heard of bloody thing all day. Mindless, badly rhetoric. It's all in the latest issue of the Miami hero. Available at supermarket checkout coders everywhere. And we're finer manure is friend. We're satisfied they were Iranian. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. We're going to be free. How about if we just play stuff all day? Wouldn't that be good? That would be great. Well, here we are. Eight minutes past ten at WINZ. And Lori Shepherd said that this was my last day on WINZ. So I guess tomorrow I can stay home. It sounds good to me, Lori. I like that. My kind of talk, you know, schedule. Two days a week and that's it. I'm just working. Sounds like they're giving you a run the air. They're giving me the boot meal. Don't, you know, show your ass to America again. Would you please? I think I have a cute butt. You know, especially since you're still going to be working, it would be who view to try to, you know, remain a little bit credible. Oh, I see. Or become, you know, I have to be given it. Become a little bit credible. And who does the imitation of me over there on the FM? So I was just speaking of a little bit credible. There he is, ladies and gentlemen. Now what are you going to do? Are you going to stay here all day now? He's up early. All right. It's about time. You know, all of the days that I've been here from nine in the morning, it'll six at night. And wouldn't, you know, here he comes trying to salvage a little good will for my audience. I'm a desperation. And I do it once. I just want to do one. Where's the other chairs that belong? I just want to do the ones. Oh, we already took the one. Oh, they want to have one here. They have already been moved. We need more comfortable chairs over there. Yes, Scott. Yeah, we don't want to say anything. And I said, just once, you can do anything you want. I'm a little, I feel better now. Do you want me to cut that up for you? Yeah, yeah, that would be good. In stereo, please. We have good enough. We don't use this monocrap. Anyway, last night was a big night at Pompanopar. Could have been a little bit bigger, but in the fifth race I had won the first four in a row. I was hot as a pistol. And the fifth race I've got marked on my program, one, two, four, eight. I know this interest you, you know, you made me. Yeah. And I go to the window and I'm going to box the one, two, four, eight in the try. And I cross it out at the window and I put the two on top. And it comes in four, two, one, eight and pay $752. Oh, when you caused great concern on my part for the future of my life. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I have a great, great gastric distress. But that's an understood. I wonder if it was a great time. How was it? It was excellent. And the Jay Michaels was there. And I invited Jay to come in here sometime today. And you're a little BS to the audience. He's not wearing a suit today. He has his bowling shirt on. Oh, yeah, he'll fit right in with this crowd. That's good. Now what is it that you guys want to cry about? You mean crying? I had to last three weeks. We do hear crying for your last three years. You know, I didn't hear it. I was in there. We thought it like it is. I was in a very happy corporate meeting. We said you're going to kick, but there's going to be a lot of people in South Florida and morning people out of work. It was the last three and a half weeks. Yeah, just a joke. It's a radio show, right? Just a joke. We did it just so we could have been glad. Speaking of jokes. Okay. By the way, we have something special for you. See, it ought to leave God and we may not have a lot, but one thing we do have going we have very creative audience. We also have a lot of other stations in the market that like to put their material on our show because they know somebody will hear it. That may stop. What a big possibility. Possibly stop. Do you think so? Yeah. No, I'm sure it'll continue right on. But yesterday I had this brainstorm for a great record. Is Joey cute up there? Now he's still young. He's going to. So I could have reached over and stopped it. I don't want to get on the floor this morning. Do you know that last night Alan Finkelson of the track came running over to me. He said, who the hell is this Joey Reynolds guy? I said, what do you mean? He said he's here. He downstairs somewhere. He wants to challenge you to erase. It was there. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to check. Come upstairs and challenge me to erase. He can't go upstairs. Can't he? He's walking. Not looking like that. Get up the stairs. Not looking like that. No, they have a special scene. That's it. It doesn't screw down stairs. There's a special spot for Zinyu. Yeah. Can you believe that? I mean, talk about desperation and looking for publicity and the Jamie show up. No. No. They're busy cooking up dinner. I feel bad. I mean, this guy works here all the time. He's in the chair to sit. Why don't you let him have a chair? We can play musical chairs. Why don't you let your elder have a chair? Yeah. That's good. I'm very happy to see you. If you just move all the blood rushing to a chair. I want to be like a musical chair. That's good. Move those down one step. Okay. Anyway, I want you to listen very carefully because I said, you know, everybody knows Willie Nelson on the road again. And I was thinking of a song that would fit our feathered friend over here because if you've ever noticed him sitting in the office the phone grows onto the ear. I wanted to know. Yesterday and he wasn't on the phone and I collapsed to miracle. Yeah. I just had like they're talking about somebody that Glenn and I know at another information. Oh, yeah. You notice even when he comes on the AM he talks off mic. Did you notice? I don't know. I'm going to be like that's your stick. Of course it's better when they can't hear you. I wanted to tell you. All right. Now listen. We have a listener whose name is George Boothroyd. Yeah. When you got a name like that, you got to do this. He just got out there. And he brought this in this morning and this is just for you. He brought it in. Listen. Down the bone again. Hey, that birdies on the phone again. The light below this city talking with his friends. Hey, that's the birdies on the phone again. On the phone again. He can't even talk while driving down that highway. But talk and listen till he pulls into his driveway. Hey, that's the birdies on the phone again. Is that a growth or just a receiving end of that phone that he's on in? But he's on the phone again. Hey, Neil, he's purged up on that phone again. That could be in the top five by next week. I think on Zeta. Yes. In stereo. You guys are going to be in stereo in a few days. Wow. What are you decided who's on the right and who's on the left? It's going to be on one end. He's going to be way on the other end. And Lee Gillette will be somewhere in the middle. Oh, I'm going to call that yesterday. Or did I have that the wrong way? I'm sorry. You're going to be somewhere in the middle. Sorry, there's such a big man that they ought to go back to Quad. Yeah. Who's going to be the guy who used to be on the FM from Quad's cities? Right? From Davenport? Yeah, this corporation loves Davenport. I'm going to think. I'm going to think. So anyway, you guys were saying what? No, no. No, we were just observing that the genius. I just wanted to say that I thought it was great how the past few weeks that you've had other morning shows. I mean, you knew about this all the time. Oh, sure. Like you were going to do this. You're not going to. I knew about it about a day after you did. You know, the way this company works. How the morning shows have been talking about you for the time. You know, the guy we had it could make a lot of money growing mushrooms because they're good at keeping everything in the dark. So it's true. In fact, I noticed the Gary was out smoking mushrooms in the backyard. Just like, well, I can't. Unbelievable. He's had a rough week. You know, the one day that they had himself lock in the John. Yeah. And he was 16 people were trying to get him to come out. And of course, it's fitting that this is our last week day on WI and Z before moving over New was Z to four. And we agreed to fighting once over here. So we're delighted to have you and I said, I'd be delighted to take off. And let you guys really show your thing to the world. But that's another story. I already showed it to him. But anyway, what I was thinking of something else. What time of day you're going to be on the radio? Yeah. Is it going to be just on the Monday? Well, I'm not really sure. Just on the Monday. The book comes out today. You are aware of that. Oh, good. Yeah, the summer book. I know you. I don't think they're doing that. Yeah, we're ever big bonuses. Oh, boy. Now, what are you going to do with it? I want to give you a little insight. Is to what the business is all about. Okay. Now, I haven't signed my contract yet for the FM okay. And these guys are with a big bucks. But yeah, right. Good man. Big bucks. Sure. You should look along. You've got a milk. I know you're not working weekends anymore. That's great. What about pay? I work in some of the business. What about the business? Starting next week? I got a real surprise for you. And Peter. Yeah. Can we mention other morning people? Sure. You want to know anything you want? Wait a minute. So anyway, this morning, I was supposed to go in there. And we were going to like finalize everything I had all this stuff laid out. A little proposal for how many million they were going to pay me. And of course, it's predicated. The incentive part is predicated on those massive 25 to 54 numbers that they had in the morning before. Like what were the six people or four seven. And of course, now the response I get is well, we'll deal with that later when you get out there. Because of course, the new numbers coming today will take a look at those. So like they're in there praying and holding their little increase to try to goose me up a little bit. Boy, what a what a company. No, what an outfit. What a business. I mean, if Craig, you can make 300. Is that disgusting or what? That's really. More power to them. I listen to the calling shows for the heart. I think he's worth 30. I listen to the morning shows for the first time. Oh, did you hear joy? Yeah. Oh, he was. He was good this morning. We heard him do the. He says I got a joke for you. The people in the control room. He says I've got a great idea for an invention. Get dog contact lenses and put little cats on him. That joke was stolen from HBO about 10 years. 10 years. We chucked. There's only one race we want you to join joy. The human race. Okay, 10 18 at WI and Z. We got a whole cast of a misfits here today. All sitting around very anxiously wondering what's going to happen. We're all still employed, right? Everybody here is still employed. Sort of. Oh, for staying. He doesn't know yet. I'm looking forward to that. What's wrong with that? I'm doing something. We can. There's nobody else here. Other things that I'm doing the week. You got your thing and we got our thing. You know, never the twain. Never the twain. The twain. That's one of my favorite. No, I'm finished as of Monday. That's what Steve Keynes said. Yeah, what are you on stand? We're going to shut down the radio station. Meals. Are you going to be on Z every day? I'm not sure. We'll see how it goes Monday. Okay. All right. Let's take a break. Let's try to come down and bring back a little decorum and respectability here. Okay. Why? It's 10 19. Gotta do a lot of time checks. Okay. Love it. I do with the temperature. I'm going to go get that. You got to do the way. You just make it up. What about 80? It's about 78. 80. 80. 80. It's like the time they give on it. I'm into about 10 o'clock. Yeah, it's a little after like they do on hot one. Yeah, I love that. I looked at my watch that there was seven past nine. It's a little after nine o'clock. You know, they feel what you're doing mushrooms. What they're doing is they make what time it is. Okay. And of course the people listening to that scratch music. They know what time it is or day. Maybe we got to start on a first record Chicago. Does anybody know what time it is? That would be. We're going to just think of the month. Yeah. Yeah. Somewhere around the middle of October. We'll come right back. This is the new launcher show. This is your brain. Any questions? What are you looking for, Stan? Ashtray. How about this one right here? There's only one. Well, I keep taking them out. They don't want you to keep munging up the studio. Okay. Oh, by the way, are we allowed to smoke in the FM? No, no. No. No. No. Oh, sorry. I think that could do it. I think you guys are safe. Yeah. You know, the interesting part of it is I haven't signed anything yet. That's the humor part of the video. Good. I could back out at any moment. I haven't been. No, we can shift. I haven't signed an answer. Post the numbers come out in a minute. You get like a six or something. We went there during the summer. Oh, that's during the spring back whoever was. One third of the last. Who was there? Jeans was there. And the summer. And Jeff. We started in the beginning of September. Four weeks. We ran for the last. You think the least you could do is give me a light. You know what I'm saying? Well, if we sound like we're a little loose this morning, it's because we are. And we really, who the footage just came in. Everybody could be real loose by noon. You know what I mean? We enjoyed the retrospective. You guys gave up your four weeks on the air. All the three movies. Three months. Three months. Three months. Three months. The memories just flooded back into my head. The quality comedy. It's got greatest hits. The quality comedy was. Three weeks on the air. And they do. Black or spectacular. What is that thing by the way here? That's all right. Enjoy it. I don't know. Just think. Where is it? Oh, that's good. What is it? He just ate up the cart that we gave him. Oh, I didn't give it up. You didn't queue it up. That was a gift. You didn't queue it up. Oh, maybe I did. I know. Are we going to? Why do you come along? That's why I'm rating field. No one did. They've out in the air today. Did you not recue crowd at house? I haven't played crowd at house in months. Well, we know who we know. We want to listen to a little bit. Well, hey, listen. I played stuff yesterday. I was playing in a song with a lot of names. So I guess somebody on the weekend with a lot of them. Today names. But that's something out here. Here it is. A queue-up, okay. The audience is used to this style. You know, the... In fact, the audience is in stuff on cart. I don't know where they'll get him. Am I right? I'd queue. He's not going to waste our time. He's going to have to come back to you. Mr. Roger. Mr. Roger. Mr. Roger. Mr. Roger. Do you have anything to say about the assassination of the breakfast club? Unbelievable. That's quality. One of the main things we had asked over the past few days when people realized that you were taking over the breakfast club or whatever was... Is kneeling over? Is kneel going to play music? That's one of the main questions they had. We want to hear you yelling. You open very, really. You're going to do that. Cock thing. We're doing this. It's going to be you too, everyone. What is this? Oh, that's... I don't know. That's just a... Oh, I don't play that. Something's dying here. Also cigars. Yeah. Somebody died on the window in the news. The other ball. He cigars you guys are smoking this. You know what? All he's going to get is a million. You think we're saying quality rock and roll. Or is he a... We got that straight in the... He's right away. I want to be a program meetings when this is a... They don't link. Are you coming to the program meetings when we're there? No chance. You're going to run down all the cops. We have nothing to do with the rest of the radio station. I'll give you a promoted and we will pray for it. Got only knows. But that's it. You're not going to call it an island. You have to like butcher the promotions we do, aren't you? No. Good. Because Tony will be... Who's a little bit of a decent boy. A little worried. About what? She's just saying, is he going to make fun of the people that do these promotions on the beach with us? Of course. Oh, we got an uptight, sugar used to it. Yeah. She actually is. All of a sudden she knows who I am. You know how long she's been here? She has no clue as to where this happened. All these new people this week, which is exciting. Well, these people that have been in the building. Yeah, now we know where all the money goes in this joint, right? But we're getting all these questions out before you sign the contract. About the music and the demos and the making... What time is the book come on? Boy, this is pressure. I bet you Mr. Ego is really nervous right now. What do you think, Stan? A lot of pressure. Maybe you ought to save those flowers and send them back on where the aisle did he could be. Did you guys hear about the flowers? I saw him. Boy. What an ego, massive ego. When a guy spent money for it too. A lot of money. He did. Well, when you're making the big bucks. Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. Yeah. Maybe Gregos had some flowers. Or maybe Donald. I'll send this some pansies or something. Ah. Some cute little flowers. Oh, Donald. How could I have forgotten Donald this morning? They forgot Nusboy real fans. Oh, that's a lot. We disappeared from that show this morning. I didn't hear your name mentioned on the internet. I didn't hear your name. I took Richmond. Oh, yeah. Joey was obsessed this morning, but there was one guy who kind of lost his tongue. It's a good time. That was it. I heard the word is somber. I think it was. The rest of it's a good time to find a new time slaughter. Donald was trying to get that out of another mark. Come on, Donald. Get serious. By the way, Neil, today is the one year anniversary of my firing at Love 94. All right. What year? That's for a lot of 94. We always knew that there were a very nice bunch of programs. If you say what happened in a year, you know, I think goes on way up. They've got way up since you left there, haven't they? All in this dreadly because they got rid of me. I would think so. Yeah. That was crappy movie reviews that you used to. Yeah. That's what kept them down. Oh, TJ Simmons brought those sticky buns again. Oh, God. I see. I wasn't. I wasn't going to eat anything. But I got to tell you. I can't really get all boy. I think Joey sent those over. Don't you? Well, I just sent me into an insulin shock for Monday morning. Well, I get a lot of people are concerned. Hey, good luck. You'll be glad to thank you, John. I'm auditioning for an FBI agent on Vice in about an hour. No, it's an FBI agent portraying a record rep. I've got to get, I have to go to the rock on that one. Yeah, typecast. Yeah. So I got to get that. Let's do one little parting thing for Dave Capriita. Okay, thank you. This is the Neil Roger show. This is your blame. Any question? I've got a lot of quality of the music. No, you're on the laughing, but I'm sure it's that. That is a classic. I know. He may be in the anals of a broadcasting history. What? Oh, that thing. I'm serious. That is a clip. Well, you ought to know something about that. I like stains on the window, and I can't believe it. It's disgusting. There are a cheek marks up there. He wanted me to join him in that. No, I have promised to promote guns or show a lot, but I'm still delirating it. Delibrating about that to the six show in the afternoon. He needs it. Okay. See you guys later. Good luck. Good luck. We'll drop in on you once a week. Thank you. I mean, at least now you'll have an audience. So there's food up there, so maybe you want to like rip half of it off before it winds up back here. Okay. Before I look at that, even Glenn is leaving now. You know why I said there's food up front. You ever see a move so fast? Right. Settlement rolls. It's funny because he said before, gee, it's only 10 o'clock in the morning when he heard that there was food up there. Settlement rolls. So what is it that you really said about Sally Fitz? Every day there's another crisis. I knew nothing about this, but I was sitting in there minding my own business. And, you know, I prefer we wouldn't discuss it. Oh, I see. Well, why didn't you tell me that? Well, I didn't tell you that. There's so many important people. Oh, that's neat. How did you like that meeting? That was really exciting. Glenn and I were having quite a dissertation about that. Yeah. I was a highlight of my days so far. Of course, I don't work here anymore. So I really care. You know, I'm going up to the other end of the building. You know what I mean? Well, if there are people tuning in this morning or wondering, What time are you going to be on? Six to 10 a.m. Six to 10 a.m. Monday through Friday. You know, it's really something Alan Finkelson had popular last night. He's saying to me, oh, you were going to be up here every night now. You know, and now you're six to 10. I'm trying to explain to him it's in the morning. Okay. Alan of course doesn't know what six in the morning is. And I'm trying to really, you know, it's very difficult. They should have the track. What? Because the horses are up there. Yeah, but Alan ate up there at six in the morning. He's just getting in at that hour, I think. But that's another story. But to know we had a pretty good time. A lot of winners again last night, but only one of few dollars. Just a very few same thing that one race, man. I'm going to the window and I'm have, it was disgusting. Really? And I changed my mind right at the window and it came in. In fact, not only the trifecta, but the first four were the four horses. I was going to box and it paid 752 bucks. I would have made you day. And Dave was throwing fondue at me for the rest of the evening. But that's a way, coach. Yeah. That was a food. Food was very good. I had some liver with onions and he had prime rib. We had onions soup. And the great cheese that you want to go up there some night. I'd like to. Yeah. But with your new hours, I don't know how you're going to do it. Don't have to stay the whole card. Start 730 a stay till 1030. That's about to go right at 9. No, not really. No. 1030, maybe. 1030, get up around 430. That's what? Six hours. No. See, when you work mornings, you don't sleep eight hours anymore. You have a whole different schedule. Yeah. And then maybe you nap a little. Now here's another guest. Boy, I feel like Don McMeanley, McSlamiel on the breakfast club now. He's dressing down now that he's going to be a jemal. You're watching me as sloppy as we are here. Yeah. He's so good. See, he came along last night. Just in time to watch me blow that fifth race trifecta. Sure. I'm still thinking about that. That was tragic. In following in your tradition, I wrote down the numbers of the trifecta of race right before I left. No, seriously. And I didn't have their night drive. He didn't have the race. And I said, I blew my brains outstand on every race. Did not win a dime. Yeah, but that was not a break. Let's be honest. It was not a big try. No, he had a big try. We would have gotten $44. So, J, let's not, you know, letting not start a $44 rating. You know, even started the show yet and already you're exaggerating. J and Michaels is going to be here starting Monday from 10 to 2. And we'd also on Saturdays from 6 to 10 a.m. Which is disgraceful. I can't believe they let the con you in doing six days again. Yeah. That's very foolish move on your parts. Not too late. Have you signed anything? No, nothing is signed yet. They're again. We're on the same position. Tell them I'll re-vidirech. No, I haven't signed either, but I have a feeling that they will not let me out of the building today until something happens. But they want to, the others still want. They want to examine the new book. They want to give themselves a little more leverage. So, let me take a look at my microscope and one point one instead of a 1.0. They're going to have some real serious leverage there. By the way, I'm moving Saturday. Nobody knows about that on the area. Are you moving physically? No, I'm moving to Neil's old slot on Saturday. Oh, yeah, 10 to 2. Oh, yeah. We've got all kinds of things going on here. It's changing. I mean, the excitement in the air around here. You could cut it with a knife. I know. Well, there's some knives and forks right there. Give it a start. And of course, we want you all to continue in the tradition of sending it all the good food for J and Michaels because Drake and Packer away like no six minutes. No, we've ever heard of it. I've got to tell you, I've been trying to stay with this weight watch or thing, but just rip that bag open. Come on, rip it open. My diet has worked about as well as yours. You know, I mean, I go on for about two days and they're great. You know, and you lose five or six pounds. You say, okay, well, I've lost five or six and I'll gain 15. Hey, listen, you can tell Peter Duchen. Thanks for the, but we still have the other card from the other day. Okay, okay, Peter, let's not overdoing. But thanks for the boy from TJ Cinema. I can't believe you brought that stuff. Well, this now stand this. You remind you a little of Philadelphia. Yeah. Well, you know, they're like Joey, Joey reminds you of Philadelphia, doesn't he? They don't have the last one. Tonya Philly sucked. I've been trying to tell him that. But he won't believe me. Hey, still has the bruises when he threw him down the steps at Wibbit. Yeah. The most fascinating thing is, Joey was in Philly for such a long period of time and he was never success. No. Well, you never, except for Buffalo, he's flopped everywhere. He's been new haven to York, Philadelphia, that little town, by land, Jersey over the hell was. I got a little everywhere. I write a little column for stage and screen. I think in the last one, I said, Joey's trademark has been fired from some of the best stations in the country. Yeah. The incredible part is how they ever hired him in the first place. Of course, when you're working at WNBC in New York for 80 grand a year, you know. Well, you take a few lumps and you can. Yeah. Well, there's some people like that in the business. I think the dance kind of appures when it comes to Cinema Enrolls. He doesn't go for the caramel and the glaze. That's all boy. These are excellent. You got a long record. We can play while we enjoy the show. No, I can do it on here. I think I got like this. I can do it. Play all this as everywhere because Joey's got him coming on the show. No, I'm not going to play Elvis's everywhere. Okay. He's gunster, monogram director. Go direct your own show. Monos coming on. When you get that show straightened out, then you come to me. Okay. And I want Stan and Os. I'm not holding my breath. I'm still part of some music for him. Yeah, I don't want that. I don't know the way he's doing this. I just do ours in music lately. I think I'm going to do it by my two hours in stereo. Would you please? Oh, well, you now have to do stereo bits for you guys. That's yeah. Part of the deal. It's part of the plan. I'm going to do the old parmesan. I want to hear this one more time. Just an honor of our flying feathered friend. Sound the phone again. The light below is sitting and talking with his friends. If that's the bird he's on the phone again. Sound the phone again. He can't even talk while driving down that highway. The talking never ends. That isn't till he pulls into his driveway. And if by the way, he's on the phone again. Yeah, that's the bird he's on the phone again. Is that a growth or just the receiving end of that phone that he's on in? But if he's on the phone again, he's on the phone again. Oh, blah, blah, blah. We're about a half hour away from climax ladies and gentlemen. At the WI and Z computers, as the summer book number is coming, and all this, well, listen, oh, today isn't paid a day. It's next Friday, right? Thanks, friends. Sorry. Well, might be for some people. We understand, yes, we read, we read rumors. This is the biggest rumor mill in the country. I think it's a humble leave of the city. Oh, no, I'm not sure that there's some bigger yentice. Although, of course, you kind of waited down the end. It was very interesting though, as soon as the announcement was public yesterday.

Can you say crap? I said well, you were going to make a mistake. Can you say kinky? When you were on vacation, I had a something I called the management at clubs and I, for who fired me. Oh, can I say that again? Yeah, I said it then. Yeah, let's reminisce about that one. We run that take back. After we finish reminiscing about the three weeks of the breakfast club. Are you going to do a retro spectate today on the Neil Roger? No. They're not going to do that. That'll be Monday. Yeah, Monday. We'll start with Helen Dale. Helen Dale and Jorge. Remember when? Yeah. Well, what I think we'll have to do is I'll have to handle it in a withdraw situation. Yeah. It's like coming off of a drug definitely. We have a lot of best of tapes in the past. We're going to do a little bit of withdrawal situation. Great moments with me. We'll just, we got the pig lady. They won't be that much. Yeah. We have a fiber. Yeah. Yes. Biber can do an hour. Right?

I heard they've been tried to buy Columbus over Monday. These cinnamon rolls last a long time. Yeah. Chris is coming. Are you looking for food too? I'll look at this. Here's Gina now. That's holding for the girl. She comes a visit that's so often when there's no food. She comes in either when Dave is here or when food is here. One of the other. Yeah. Is that the way I can get her on the air is to have food in here. The only way is that's it. I want to audition her for our lean slot. She wouldn't do it. No chance. I asked. No. You wouldn't come in. She doesn't have the cheeks for it. Trust me. She can never ever feel our lean seat. Believe me. Thank you, Naomi. You're welcome Gina. Anytime. Stop by and see us at the other end of the building sometime. I think she'd be very good at you. What? She? Well, I don't know if you'd be good or not. She's married. Oh, well. I don't want to scare that. We're trying to talk her out of it. She's good luck. She's trying to go into it. Hmm. Okay. Although we did have one of those two guys who were here the other day, she was feeling them both. Did you remember that? When Jay and Scott were here. How is Scott doing by the way? Is he okay? Yeah. Okay. Good. I'm going to say as he's fine. Is he really? Well, we'd like to find out. And you all hear what he says about her. I'm sure. Hmm. What was it ever revealed, uh, Irma's real, uh... Yes. What? I'm digging myself like per real. I think it's a real bang. It's a real bang. It's a real bang. It's a real bang. It's a real bang. It's a real bang. Well, Irma is a very well-proportioning young lady. Did that ever come out on the air? This is the most disgusting. That's right. I hear some stories from her traffic because I can't the vault. Well, interesting stories are there. There was a presence when Irma is in the room. Yeah. A large presence. Yes. You're aware that she's there. Yeah. We just say that. Yeah. You see the guys in the building are all kind of following, hovering around. Trueling. Yeah. Yeah. It's a little like food. Well, we hired Irma because we wanted to prove that the only boobs in the building were not just management. And, uh... And I think we've done that, yeah. Or that the biggest boobs in the building were that was just gross. Yeah. I was searching for it. It was just a day she was telling me she has three jobs. And one of them she says is telemarketing in the evening. In addition to here, but that she drafted it that, is it? Well, telemarketing. And that's stretches that you could be, um... She flies with the... Well, she does this thing off. I'm a home shopping network. I can't say what she sells. But she's on the home shopping. Just a joke, Irma. Come on. Listen at that. You're selling stuff on the home shopping network. I don't know. I will stop. I will stop. I will stop. Yeah. Yeah. Every night. See, that's a problem with these idiots that run these home shopping things. They put these... Oh, nothing's on the air, you know. I mean... Oh, they're terrible. Boy. You know, people who didn't make it big in Orlando, right? That's exactly right. Without all that false enthusiasm. And the first one, the... There's so many of them now. You would think that one of them would have a really dynamite, you know, couple. Would you? Yeah. Well, I would if I was running it. That's the same talking about home shopping. I need to haircut this, really. I think we ought to get a... For our first morning on Zaden. Cut your hair. How to get my hair cut on the ear. Great idea. I want to get that on the ear. Yeah. Yeah. I had that ready for two. It's ready. And it's cheap too, because they won't let you... Maybe a little tip that's better. That's it. A couple of mentions you've done. Yeah. You know how many calls you're going to get from beauty, beauty, salons now. Think of the old trimming. Yeah. And the bird, too. A little trimming. Yeah. But the feathers a little bit around the cotton blum blum blum. Yeah. But I appreciate, man, he's been getting me that cuttleburn. I've been impressed. It needs a very impressive. Boy, these cinnamon rolls just last and wine. I know, they're just enormous. The sort of my stand of something else. Yeah. He doesn't want to tell us about stand?

And also the bird can do the traffic report from the sky with no overhead expenses. Yeah, that's great. Good thinking. One bad piece of news for you. Who's going to be here to say, bring that baby down? One bad piece of news, Jamie and Mark, he just bought beta. And the body replaced. Ah, ah, we're in trouble. Oh, I have a question for the camera.

Who is with the B? Who is with the B? You want to tell them how it was when we went to Europe, but you did all those second predictions. Yeah, that's one thing when she was talking to work in 25 years ago like that, but because it's 40 years old now, you know. She's on me at one function one time or whatever. And she says, let me tell you one day you're going to be bigger than Rick Shaw. I said, look at me. I said, I'm already bigger than Shaw. That was really good. That was really good. That was really good. You're kidding. Rick didn't call you yesterday, by the way. You're kidding. Rick didn't call. I bet you didn't have any celebrities. Look at this. It's an old fart.

We're just killing a little time, by the way. Oh, this is for those heavy numbers to come. They say that. That's an added reason why everybody in the business is definitely tuned in. They know that their own stations are not going to give those numbers when they come off the computer. Now all the management people kind of hover around and crumble and make little sounds. They're doing bars. They're the last ones to find out. Well, Neil, we are overjoyed. We finally got rid of you. Oh. Why are you being congratulated as beyond thinking? It should be condolences. We won. You're on the skids. Your history used to come back. Thank God. Glenn goes to. I recognize that writing. Oh, yeah. Today I'm usually at the verbos in a waste basket.

Much later on. You'll have to investigate that. Oh, it looks like this was supposed to be sent to you and they sent it to Betty's rare records. Good. Oh, it's a tape. Yeah, they want Betty to start putting that material on the set. And, you know, she's probably got some, oh, listen to this one from Irwin Goldstein and Tamarack. This is great. This is a classic. Listen. Neil Rogers, you are a fact disgusting, ugly, profane, unfeeling, homosexual, faggot queer. Wait a minute, listen. I think the way you put everyone down is sick.

It's a great move and fantastic. That you're going on to the FM side. Hopefully you'll be able to play some of my dad's songs in the morning. Oh, yeah. We're going to be having an Elvis concert on Monday morning just for you, Elvis. Well, I'll tell you what, hey, Stan. Yeah. What the hell are you doing at our service? So awful, isn't it, DJ? Did you spend the night there? I thought it's my tribute to... Yeah, he spent the night with her. Am I here by the way? Yeah. I knew I had a little tribute. Okay, Elvis. And this is one of my dad's songs and I obviously have changed the words a little bit. That's okay. And this is too, buddy. Hmm. And now we're in the near and so I'll face my final name and call us. My friends, all say I'm queer. But just wish I was a little taller. I've made a rifle for both and now I'm going down the hallway. All much more than this. I'll do it my way. On the livable Elvis. Yeah, there were times. There's more. You knew when I been old? My Papa's home and I could choose. Oh, through it all. One day was down. I saw Jimmy's face and spit it out. I was still small. Oh, my God. Thank you, Elvis. You're great American Elvis. Thank you. Okay, Elvis. Well, I was in a critical. Oh boy. I'm all choked up. We have somebody from TJ's cinnamon's on a line. Hello. Hi.

That was the, and Steve came to six. And what do we have? I don't. Where? Overall. And what does stand here? No, that's not the point. I mean, what did stand do? I don't have to get him through. Oh, you know, my way. And now, how come he's got the numbers? And we've got guys sitting back there with the computer with his thumb and his I don't know. I don't know. These numbers are all accurate. They're all accurate. Absolutely. Yeah, my computer. Wait a minute. I'm not going to get him on his computer. How do you like it? What? Two, six.

I might share some of that wealth, you know what I mean? Oh, yeah. And the later morning, show got a six. Yeah, we have some more coming in. Pigeon, more coming in now. Okay, okay. From the Channel 10 Weather Tower. Hello, hello. Yeah. I had a five-row. Ooh, and hot one of five had a three, too. Wow. And why 100 had a three, three? Oh, boy. Oh, boy. What about Z80? Z80, I don't know. They just like, no. Haven't gotten that four down yet, huh? No, okay. Ha ha ha ha ha. Even alphabetically. Yeah, right. See, you know. See. Yeah. That's what he did. But, by. Okay, there he goes. Now he's gone. Leave him alone. You're not supposed to speak to him anyway. Penalty of extermination. Well, he's no longer Mr. Cakes, so I can talk to him now. Can I? Or really? Want a bet? No. I want a bet. In fact, that's the first thing I told Peter Bulljoins. I said, if you're looking for a good way to get you know who I'm going to go. My Emmy, hello. Hey, first time calling. Great. Colony thing. You know, it would be good after the gun for the Joey thing. As you put a 12 flush there. We could arrange it. We're going to need to get the gun. You want to kill just a moment or two here. We want to be able to do that. It's not great. Okay. Everybody here wants to kill a moment or two. I gave Lee this dirty magazine. He wanted to butcher up a little bit. Get ready for a moment. Interesting reading. Yeah. We're going to have to keep this in my mouth. All right. Let's get this to try now. Ladies and gentlemen, wait a minute. This may be something that they'll be calling from Sheet of Barrow. If you jail, have to spend an hour in production, putting this together. I think so. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that worked fine. Yeah. But we're going to work well for us. Well, yeah. All the way to the bottom. Make a score, ever. Okay. There he goes. We're getting a lot of tiny bulldozer. They didn't. We had to float. We saw that number. Joey. I wasn't floating. It wasn't floating. I was floating. It wasn't floating. We didn't float. They didn't float. We saw that number. Joey. What's that floating? It was floating. It was thinking. Thinking. Tamarack. Hello. Tamarack. Speak to us. Okay. I don't know. I must have been sunny on his mobile phone. He must have hung up one year. He was a point. We always get caught from Tamarack. Tanner beats sunny in a morning, huh? Excellent. No wonder we haven't heard from sunny for two days. But we should have come from Tamarack. But we should have come from Tamarack. But for the numbers. And we hear from Kai. Okay. Here's a call must be a stand major fan. Freeport. Doves. Yeah. What's happening, dude? You can't go to have fun. Oh, that's right. You're going to lose the Bahamas. Oh, yeah. We won't be able to hear us anymore, right? You can only catch a lead at NATO at the back. Let me ask you again. You can't hear the FM during the daytime? Not very clearly, though. Good. Okay. 11.45. I don't want to hear those behamians bugging us. Leave that all on the AM. Call up stand and get the ADL in here and all these other people. All these pain and the ASP people. We just want to have a good time over there, right? When I look for all this controversy and all this heavy stohations marching in a parking lot. Right? I thought that was Valdez. For a modern deal. Hello. Hello, now. Hi. How are you? Good. How are you? Firstly, I want to ask you guys. And the FM is that you're having one terrific time. Well, we sure are. Yep. I want to congratulate you on Glenn on your move. I think you're doing the good thing. Nobody asked you the other day. Me, all the bad habits are rapping when the Wednesday. Oh, I'm going next Wednesday. I couldn't go. We're in all these big bureaucratic meetings. Oh, God. And there's nothing worse than being wrapped up like a momma when you want to go. I bet that way. Okay. Just for you. Have a wonderful day. Thank you. Congratulations again. Okay. Thank you. What a nice week. I know what we're talking about. What are you having a wrap to me? I hold body for what? It's going to come in looking like Glon Scheney in Thursday morning. It's a body wrap. They wrap you on all this big cover your body with mong and they wrap you up like a momma, and they take it all off. And you look like Robbie Bellus. It lose 180. The only problem is you start talking like Robbie Bellus. Okay. It's 14 till noon. And Bob, but we'll take that break now. Right? Get it on the way? Because any minute those numbers are going to be coming in. You know, all the computer kids all over town have them. But where's the? Where's the waiting? Where is the waiting? This is from this is the Neil Roger show. This is your brain. Any questions? Did you hear that at the end of that again? Wait a minute. It's rolling up the eatery. When it cues up again, just four or five minutes here. One of these guys do it. They do like a ten second bit and they put it on a five and a half hour car. Why do they do that? Well, he just wanted to be sure there was plenty of room on the car. Yeah, so we couldn't play it back to back and catch any of those little runaway sound. That's it. One of these days I'm telling you it's going to queue up again. I'm positive. That's all about breath. You may want to take a couple of fall. This is the Neil Roger show. Listen carefully. That's because you're blind. Any questions? Hmm. You hear that there? It's there. The one-way s headed up the turn five now. I'm going to say that. Can't you just see the headline now? You know, six killed by runaway s on turn five near Disney World. Okay, here comes the usual empty handed ladies and gentlemen. On the computer. What the hell is he doing back there? Well, it seems that there are so many people in the area who have gained access. Yeah, that we don't get it at the moment. ours has been delayed because some other people are wondering if some hackers. You wonder if that's how it's just around you. It would well be. Kindle area maybe found this. Maybe down in Kendall. It could be. And I'd be delighted to go in during the new news break. Give the phone number down there. We couldn't find out what the hell's going on. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Because it would be nice. We would like some of the information too. All since we're paying for it. Although we're for it. Yeah. And he's not. But maybe of course on the other hand, you'll call back and give us the rest of the number. There when he has him, I'm sure he will. You think he will? Yes, that line. Yes, that line. Sure. All right, rarely do we invite that particular individual to call in. But because we're desperate and because everybody else is job and a market is hanging on it. Get with it. Dana. Dana, hello. Dana. Another antique. South day, hello. Hi, this is Glenn. Yeah, Glenn. Listen, if you're a little bit of M. Don and Sam, this is gone. K-Fog. To an F-N station, is that supposed to go? Look, when you please watch it, you know, we're under surveillance here and everything is, you know, nip and talk. Just watch yourself. It's good. It's really good. Great. Hey, this is, I got a steam sound for your new show. Okay. Only home in the bucket that's paid him and trying to ride. You got a new great for that album. Yeah. We're a play that love. Yeah. A lot of great for dead and morning. Yeah. Thanks a lot, pal. Good work. Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. Hi, this is Mary Beth. Hi, Mary Beth. How are you doing? I'm fine. I'm a first time caller. Okay. And are you going to the morning, sir? On a day. On a day. You bet. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. Are you going to be listening? Yeah. I also listened to your, well, I was wondering, what? Well, wait a minute. Hold on. You can say it on that day. I have a question. I was wondering, what is the war going on between you and Joey? This personal, because he says he doesn't know you. I don't know him either. I just know about him. Oh, you don't know each other. No. Well, he said he thought you read his mortgage over there and that got him upset. Oh, no. They got him upset? Yeah. Did you do that? I read parts of it. Yeah. Somebody brought it in here. One of his good friends from CalFed. They brought it in here. That's ridiculous. Of course it is. Now, who's going to be taking your place on, on am? J. Michaels. He's sitting right out here. Hi, Mary Beth. Hi, nice to meet you. Nice meeting you. Are you going to still do Saturdays? Who? Neil. No. Are you kidding? You're not going to be back at all. No way. Okay. Why? I still like to listen to both. Okay. Also, do you know how do they calculate these ratings? I was just curious. How do they find out? I think it's so long. They invite psychics in. Right. And every element. What do we can't talk about that? What does that mean? Calculating the ratings? So have you ever seen the lottery machines very best? Yeah. Like the thing though, machines? Yeah. Well, they take every radio station. They write their name for one of the balls. And then, don't know seriously. They have a machine with all the radio stations written on a ball. And then another machine with all the different personalities in the market. And then they have a third machine with different numbers in them. And then they have a question machine with Lee. That's a whole lot of rumors. That's all they're talking about. So they go to the first machine. They pull out a number. Okay. Stand major. And then they go to the next. Okay. WNC. And then they go. Whatever. Oh, and then I can't do that. That's how they do it. I'm just I'm so curious. I think I do it in a story. I'm very bad. So in four of this, Mary Beth, the radio stations pay millions and millions and millions and millions of dollars every year. Because Joey was telling everyone to tune in there. Why are you listening to him? He's not an authority. He's not an authority. He's a hate man. Who would counter to this morning? Well, that just got me curious. Yeah. You mean, do you like your IQ and this? Very bad. All the way. Don't understand. There's a one way conversation. Very bad. Yes. You're a major. Do you like Joey Reynolds? Uh, well, yeah. I did like him at first because I used to listen to Howard Stern. I thought he was just great when I was in New York. And what did you like about Howard Stern? Well, he's kind of a David Letterman type. And I don't know. He's in a way. He's kind of rude. But he says things like they are. And like he thinks they are. He's very open minded. I just think. I think he's filthy myself. I think he's hysterically. He's disgusting. Yeah. And then Joey's going to be feeling a little out of hand lately. Especially with this more going. He's getting a little rude. And I think he's a little too much. Well, we're tired of that. Hi, hi. Is it an inch? Yeah. Yeah. Lovely. Two in. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. Oh, my. I don't think he's had phones on a wagon. I don't know. Very bad. Sorry. Yeah, I think I want to work for you. What's that song you played for him? This is for you, Marathon. Oh. Okay. Okay. Is that making feel at home, Mary Beth? Well, yeah, but I think I'll probably listen to you more often. Good. I think you have a little more taste. I think you're right. Thanks a lot. Okay. Thank you. It's a good time for it, too. You have to bring that Donald up again, right? Do I have to? Sorry. Isn't the amazing how they like had a lobotomy overnight in our name? Of course. Just got removed from their vocabular overnight on gloves 94. We heard rumors that there were high level meetings in this town. Really? Yeah. Are you sure? You're closed or? Oh, yeah. You're not under penalty of the young man. I wouldn't imagine. Oh, yeah. Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yes. This is Joe Caroyo. Mr. Caroyo. How you doing? Yes. Very good. And you today. Wonderful. I've been like this idea of moving into the FM. Good. Well, listen. You know, we always do about you, Joe. Miami. Yeah. This is an Atlantic mama. Have you heard of it? No. No. It isn't. I know it's a curtain. Oh, I'll go. That's wonderful. You're from Detroit. I'm from Detroit. Right. Yeah. And this is to you all the time. Wonderful. I wanted to call you one thing. See if you can take it as well as you can dish it out. Okay. Oh, you're douchebag. Oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. How much? Thank you. You're douchebag. Thanks a lot. Okay. Very mobile. Yeah. I need a lot of solid joy calling. Yeah. I think so. Listen, congratulations. I have a tip for Stan. Okay. Don't buy a house. Okay. What's that like, Michael Tabbid, you hear that? Yeah. Yeah. Mobile. Yeah. Yeah. We got you. Okay. I want to congratulate Neil on his up-and-coming move. Yeah. Thanks. You're welcome. Can I say hello to everybody at work? Go ahead. I'm going to be a company. If you need repair price for your plumbing. We'll fix your plumbing. Yeah. You sound like you know about lot about plumbing soon. The plumbing worked on. Now we'll work on it. Okay. All right. Bye-bye. You too. Wait till he gets the bill for that. Okay. Another request for Jeff Strikers home number there. But it is a good way to realize that the blue hairs are not going to be able to. They don't have that. The hell they don't. No, they don't have that. They were the first ones to have that. You know, you don't even know where you are. You're like pretty Reynolds this market is the number one FN penetration. If I can use it for that good time but I've gotten a great to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to rate to. Trying for that great to rate to rate. And it's very. Look at how it's reigning. I'll get ready for it if you're not prepared. Oh. Yeah, that little episode for Reef that was set over yesterday. I think we need to send that back. Yeah. We ought to get Elvis to go and sing. and saying return to sender. Oh, I'll tell you. Because Steve, if you're listening, things are not good, is somebody I know is. And he is, listen. Don't you think he's listening? Don't go to work today, Steve. And you know, Steve, although he's whole routine about, wow, ratings are an important. And I don't, you know, I'm not interested in ratings. And I go home with a good conscience. I wonder if that's true on payday. I think I've got a good conscience on the payday. I wonder. I mean, a two-nine in the afternoon for that kind of money. Oh, you know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. And of course, this makes my cantony and Bob Rich look real good at IOD. They're the real happy ones. Oh, yeah. They're at a bull geniuses. And then that big check over boy. And Stan got a what? Stan. I bet you're part of it. Because there's an echo in there. I'm going to put that good time. Put that good time. But I'm great. Okay, just try to control yourself. Stan got a four-one in afternoon drive. Excellent. Very good. Very good. Like Alice Rantel had a three-two. Steve pardon me for being a shill and a douchebag. Steve had a two-nine. Two-nine. So he's number three in the afternoon in the number three. Okay. Number three of three. He can be a place by. By the way, because he had the full month of June to set the stage. July August September. So we had that month of start, which he had a disaster by the way. But then, of course, the July August September. And he doesn't seem to be making much headway. He can be replaced by Tom Lycus, any time. Oh, oh. His buddy. See, you don't know when things are good. Say, you don't know when things are well enough. You just got to screw around and screw around. It's always been the story of your life. Don't start bringing people like Lycus back. We've already got this Ray Charles gun. What did he get? Well, I don't know because, let's see, we had a seven-five in midday. Even though there were all these predictions, we were just dying on the vine. It's all over. No, it's all over. No, it's all over. Just passing phase. And here we are with a seven to five. Number two in the entire market again, beaten only by lifeless. On FM with an eight-one. And then, if nobody can beat them, you know, they're on an every office. They've got a captive audience and all the doctors and dentists. Force listening. And the elevator. And they're on the elevator. They're in every elevator. No one in that's still listening. You imagine the length of listenership. They get when you're trapped in an elevator. I mean, talk about a captive audience. Better standard Charles was going to have Ray Charles on his own. Yes, today's singing gets crying time again. Yeah. Or hit the road jacket. That's something like a torture. Oh, my God. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah, we understand in making a job and making it. Well, they can surf up there, can they? So as soon as, you know, as soon as we get the numbers with the station, that'll be good. Because this page has got, like, just numbers, which is good. Well, we get no strangers over here. But we even were out there. As they throw them out the door, he's going to say, what I'd say. Yeah, and then we'll have a pretty good idea what the hell's going on. But we did very well. WI and Z had a five as obviously said. Yeah. As obviously said, all the end of other numbers wrong. He did. And that tightest for third in a market life of court. Lifeless was number one. But only with a seven this time. They seem to be slipping a little bit. Some of those people are dying on. Yeah. QBA was second with a six five. And there's WI and Z tied with some FM for third with a five. And if he ever brings me the other sheet, oh, it's powerless. Yeah, that's right. That's what I've said. That's right. And the tenor in the morning had a four nine. Number four. But I guess they beat Sony. Mm-hmm. I don't have that on the sheet yet. And we'll go through the whole thing because we know there are a lot of very desperate people in the business who are listening to the right to the audience. Couldn't give a damn last question. What do we care? We're gone here, right? We don't care. Thanks. See that stand. Isn't that a great way? Yeah, blame me now, okay? I'm leaving you with this gigantic, short-body audience. You're sitting here with a seven to five. Thank you. And a day, the second high up number that in the history of mankind. And that was during a summer book. And of course, if it wouldn't have been for Ali North, that probably could be like a good five or a nine again, right? You might have been. You might have been. Yeah. That's true. Ali was here this right? Ali was here for a solid week. And of course, they didn't help you either. In a month of what was at July? Yep. July. A death now. You were on vacation? Yes. And then there were certain other shows when I was on vacation. Yeah, real decay. We don't want to talk about that, right? Yep. Okay, excellent. So if there's anybody in the business, we have some open lines in date where some of the program directors hung up during the news break after they heard these numbers. Six to four. Six to four, 9400. Probably on long distance with those consultants right now. What are we doing now? What are we doing now? Smart ass. Didn't work. Can you see the phone lines? The consultants over your move. That must have been the closed doors. They were all the fun to do your job. Probably. Iowa. You know, the cornfield and Iowa man. All the programs. How do you program this one now? Yeah. What do we do now? Davenport. Play more music. You're going to hear more music on FM in the morning. Oh, here comes a joy. She's got those heavy, heavy sheets here. All right. Thank you, Joanne. We like you, Joanne. Hey, these even have colliders on. We do. What do you want to know? Why feel like I got such power now? As Tanner would say, I like know what W.S. You've got a W.S. You lose against you against me. Well, let's see, 10 a.m. To 3 p.m. I had a 7.5. They had a 2.7. Wow. They were tied for 15th. Oh, boy. Wrong number. Holy Toledo. Where's Sandy? Oh, Sandy. Yeah, that'll turn it around. Now, when did she go back on the air? Like first of September, I think. Well, this includes the entire month of September. So if they made a big comeback, it doesn't show here. And then in the afternoon, Al was tied for 13th with a 3.2 share. What can I say? Although then to say, we're sorry. They've been smart moving out. I'm 94, not a gigantic giant number here. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Good. 3.2 share in the morning, 6 to 10 a.m. I'm 94 with a 2.7. It's down. Down, down, down. You know, bye bye, Greg. Downward trend. Well, see that's a needle rod just theater. Did that. Yeah. I can blame that. It's an old man Donald. It's a good time for the great taste. Yeah. They're going to be hanging around. I'm going to McDonald's a lot. Oh, oh. I'm not going to come up for me. Maybe that commercial Greg swimming. Oh. They're going to do a reverse cut on that. He's going to be going under the water. Tanner beat. Sunny. Tanner had a 49. Sunny had a 42. Let's see. GTR in the morning had a 3. Well, I'll tell you a lot of those FMs. Not too hot. Wouldn't it be fascinating if the GTR had a better summer book. Oh, wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen. We've made a mistake. We've made an error. Probably in my number. No. Oh. Now listen, I want to talk to the people of exotic gardens. When you send those flowers back over to the 79-screen factory, it was a 26. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Boy, that really shattered him. What a number Steve. What a number. Tied for 17th. With a station in Jacksonville. He was tied with WLRN for 17th. I can't believe the disistors didn't knock the door. I wanted to do it in a morning. What kind of a number did they have? When did Joey come in here? I don't want to go. Yeah, the most. Yeah. He had been here long. No. I didn't even get the most. Yeah. At the most. And been here long. It's about a month. Yeah. Well, he was here though, for part of that. He was here during September, right? Yeah. And they got a two-one in the morning. What do you say, Neil? Yeah. One. Whatever you say, Neil. Okay. Two-one. And, of course, Leah sitting there just waiting with the excited breath. No, then we'll be able to come in. I'm going to know that he had the only number on the station. Great. Happening. Oh, really? Yes. I don't want to say what number. Oh, seriously. You had the station at a one-four. Well, in the morning, they had the departed breakfast club at a one-point-two share. And then, midday, guns, you had a one-point-four along with some other counterparts in there. After you drive, had a two-point-oh, the first two in the history of Zayna. Wow. Let's hear it for Legia-let. There we go. Very nice. And he's a two-one. He's gone. Yeah. And at night Scott's left is a delibre marks on our newsroom window. Had a one-point-oh showing his butt to the world again. But that's okay. So how do you like that, huh? How do you like their maples? Yeah. Wow. Let's see if he could take least two to the morning block and Neil's seven. Yeah. So, we're talking about the two-point-oh. So, I can double digits here. You're talking about heavy stuff folks. We're talking quality rock and roll. We don't have to say that. No. No. We also don't say Zayna-link. No. No way. No. No cliches. But you're going to miss you too, aren't you? I'm going to miss that grateful bed record. Yeah. We're playing. We're playing that. Okay. We have a couple of deadlines open. I don't know what happened. I think a lot of the radio people are probably in emergency closed organizations. Yeah. I've been on the 24-hundred and they'll come back right after this. These are triangles going well. It was all in north and some was fillings, you know. Uh-huh. Neil. Speak to us. Uh-huh. Yes. Is this Neil Rogers? Yes. Listen. This is the office time call. But nevertheless. I've been listening for like three weeks. Yes. And you're leaving now, over it. Are we having a radio? Boy, you really have a wonderful voice for radio. A big thing. I'd be like to do a 24-h afternoon. You were backing the film. I can do it. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Plantation. Hello. Well, that clear to wax out of my ears. Boy, that'll do it every time. By the way, for the guy who called earlier wanted to challenge Stan, I hope he'll call back. Go head sir. Neil, Japanese, he channeled four news last night. Yes, I saw an I want to thank Susan Lickman and Jim Brasmur for yucking it up real good. It was great. Unbelievable. Yes, it was. I said that about ten times. That was funny.

I ran into an African guy and he actually kind of has been a night-horsehouse tonight. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean an African guy like real African or like just black? Well, he's from African. He's from African. When he wearing a Dutch-cheeky man. He's not deaf, but he's a dog skin. And I'm a American. Okay. Did any part of his body look like Jeff Strikker? Let me see. Wait, first of all, who's Jeff? What's going on? What's the rest of the story? Okay. And he said he has VCR that would have watched all her. That's called, et cetera. He's there to move this like that. And so the guys, he's like, you know, I'm looking for somebody that helped me financially. And I'm looking for an actually, you know, term your own.

But the weather, especially the check-in. Okay. Have a wonderful life, Brian. Thank you, Dad. You know, the other's a rumor going around that Brian Norcross was actually 583 pounds until he had a body wrap. And he used to be a baritone. But now that's not what he looks at sounds like Neil. That's what his voice is. She ain't gone. I heard her over that Anbishop sat on him one day. Oh, no. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. He's gone. Oh, no. Oh, you're not going to believe this. You're not going to believe this. What he's typing on a screen right now. Channel 10 is out front. Oh. Can you believe that? I believe it. I wonder Brian is here with the channel 10. You run right now. Yeah, go flying out there. West Boca. Hello. Hi, Aaron. He'll happy to see you. Thank you. Very much. Happy for you going over to the FM. You too. I can't wait to get to hell out of here. I think it's a great move. Are you going to be doing a lot of doors and creating a lot of. A lot of. A lot of the dawn's heavy stones to sir. That's good. That's good. How did the other. That's a little. Wait a minute. That's a little code message to Marcy and Jamie. Heavy stones. On the next. The real. In the book by the way. She. Well, I thought I had mentioned that. But I'd be delighted. More than delighted to go back over their mediocre numbers. Appreciate it. Let's see. She had a two six overall highlighted by a two one in the morning, which is a disastrous number. GTR. How the hell did GTR do? Did I say that a three in the morning? I had a three two in the morning. They had a three oh. There was number was in the morning. So that somewhat diminishes. Of course, you know, they look at all those young demographics, you know, those. Bean heads. Yeah, wait a minute. They get the fall book for the morning show. Yeah. Yeah. They're not exactly tearing them up. Let's put it that way. I did leave out an important number in IOD, by the way, in addition to making my mistake on Steve's number, you know, which was a two six. Let me say it again. It was a two six. And, um, yeah, I don't think we quite cut that was that. Two six. And in midday, Bill McQueen, of course, was promoted heavily as the nice guy. He had a big number. He had a two oh two point zero. Guy's to this last, I guess. As a matter of fact, uh, Lee tied him and he afternoon, Yeah, your number was a two oh and he afternoon and there are a lot more people listening and they have to know. So McQueen was right down there scraping the barnacles off the bottom of the mong. Nice guy. Did this last? You said it. I'll quick as I'm going to take them to move cane. Well, that's, you know, Steve's team really interesting all the stuff he's doing lately with that support. The scab thing and all that. Oh, yeah. Come coming out again. Free agency is really ironic what you like to be back at, uh, at snooze and that'd be a free agent. That'd be coming. Can you break? Yeah, well, he and Mr. Robbie have these long chats. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, like gut, she'll chill. That's exactly the word. And now listen, I'm teaching a media class and what about local educational institution. Oh, everybody was buzzing and really not broadcast just media and general. Good. Good. Boring team, maybe they can get like white water, jail, Charlie Cando and John Broward. They cover the market completely. Okay. Thanks so much. Hi. Hi, bye. Hi, I would be nice to Brian. What it came by with them and did the weather well, you're here too. Oh, wait, man. Let me see. This our hometown station. No. No, no, no, no. No, wait a minute. Our neighborhoods station. And they happen to be the one and only. On and on. One where they show our Carlson and Anne molesting those kids and all those is the promos. That's right. That's right. That's a lot of the tiller. Hi, Linda. How you doing? Linda's here and all kinds of people are here. From stations that haven't been invented yet. Okay. I did not know the channel six was driving up yesterday and they checked the call letters. And they were sure they were in the right place. So, there's a candlestick news card driving around out there. They're going to be here. David, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes. I just called say I'm happy I am that you're going over to FM. Me too. I work out of my den and I only have an on C&B. I only play the plays. I'm just an on one. You know, you wouldn't want to get rid of it. And it only play. You're in it. And I'm really glad I hope they get somebody that is halfway civil with people because I think that your whole program is disgusting. I just started on because it's the only station. Oh, listen to this. Joy station. Get on this down. What about this? Are you going to be halfway civil? Sir? Yes. It's about house civil lobby. What a douchebag. Absolute douchebag. Tooly got an overlarced year radio. Got by a no one you cheap jerk. What a moron. Port Latterdale. Hello. Onel? Yes, sir. How you doing today? I just wanted to say congratulations on your open coming move. And I just wanted to let you know that I think you're going to blow all of those other guys right off the air. So to speak, yeah. But anyway, listen, I was just dropping your hopes up to you all. Wing, you're a wing. First side, not that side. The other side. Where we're at the station with the X and the mobile studio. They were cranking that up. Ricky was hanging around outside the mobile studio. And I heard that he got a bad of a major campaign on Monday morning. A major campaign on the camera city. Oh yeah. We can only wait. And do a live remote broadcast. I'm ready to want to. Let them show up over here. We'll pull that camp off and when the three six you show up. That'll be the end. Where? Always that a one TV radio. I don't remember that. No, it does. I'm a TV radio. It's just for the real. Go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. I've carried away got very emotional from it. It's a lie. I am not a Nazi. OK. I heard another rumor that Joey was, they're planning a bigger move over there. They're going to put him on WFRF and they're going to boost the power up to whole five watts. Well, they are going to have a big movement over there. In fact, when they get these numbers off to computer, the fire you, I wouldn't take a shower for a couple of hours. I mean, if there's anybody in a market who's got a septic tank, look out. We're going to really find out if they sink or they float. You bet. And now are you going to be able to rub elbows with our lean? I got a news for you. Nobody can get close enough to our lean rub elbows. OK. You know what I'm saying? I took, I took. Have you ever served you? I'm sure that's from our dear. Sure. Have you ever seen Sarah? Sample that remark. Have you ever seen Mount Rushmore? Yes, sir. OK. Answer the question. 27 before one at WI and Z, we'll try to control yourself. We'll see our last, well tomorrow, I guess. Would you do something on the radio, the channel 10 can use on the news? What is it for the television? We're always going to work. What would you like us to do? Hmm. You just hear the one. Good. Because we wouldn't do it anyway. OK. Here's the weather now. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. OK. But you know that was anyways. Probably that you're for a lot of day. Hello. After you know how I am. Good. Are you going to broadcast the New Fair in Ontario? Yeah. Excellent question. That's great. We're thinking about it. That means if you do it in the stereo, the bird is going to be on the right side, and you'll be left side. Let me say it again. We need you. That's going to be on the right side. The bird will be in the middle. I want to bird on the right side, so I don't matter stereo, and I can't get my right speaker. That's a good idea. Yeah. That is like a kill the speaker. Never thought about it. Yeah. Well, well, well, and I'll spend the morning, which speaker he'll be on. OK. I do not have to bird. No. It's different. Between a young prostitute and an old prostitute. No. Young prostitute uses butter, mean from the old prostitute uses polygrip. Have a good day. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. Oh, I think. 26 to 11 and WIs. What is that beeping sound I hear? Another people with channel 10 being called back. And I guess is left to road map with the channel 10 building. Let's take a little break. And welcome back right after this. 23 before one at WI and Z. On our favorites from Channel 10, I hear the whole crowd. And we have a call here, believe it or not, from Latterdale by the sea, hello. Thank you, Neil very much. How did you just sit and knowing is there any other market out of this area that is doing talk at some wind. Windick sea. I can understand that. Is there a real obvious here? WWDB former home of Stan Major. Well, another word you're not the first. Home of Dominic Quinn. Bob Grant, Jerry Williams, and a lot of other radio misfits. Another word there is another market out there in New York doing it. Yeah. Are they successful? I'd be checked there. Number two at their doing it. Well, first of all, let me say this to you. What we're doing has an absolutely no relationship to what they're doing because they have a geriatric audience. And that's the mistake that they're doing is because they're doing old-time talk with some very old talk posts. And but they've been very successful in that market. They beat the AM competitor regularly by a good margin. But currently, the only one that is doing this sort of talk that you're doing, all the other parts shows are still geriatric. And I would say that's true throughout the country. Well, let me look at it again. Let's see. The ratings just came in an hour ago. I've got a 7.5-year-in-mid day and the next two talk. I'm coming down from your nine last time out. Yeah. But I was gone for three weeks of the summer, sir. Okay. That's a good excuse. It was replaced by all at North. Yeah. I'm down from the nine. Like, like, what do you want? So you want to 25 sure you sound like the guys at IOD. 12 sure minimum. They're never happy. They're never happy. That's right. We're pioneers. We're like Marco Polo. Of course. Christopher Columbus. Right. Another program, correct? Christopher Columbus. You say that Sandy did? The Italian sailor. What? Well, Sandy was only there for a month in all fairness. So she probably brought it down. But, um. Let's see. Where is it? Wait till I get that far down on the lists. WNWS. Midday. They had a 2.7. Pretty great. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. That's a great idea. At a 2.7. Pretty grim. At his grim. Pretty grim. 2.7 tied for 15. Well, I think what they got to do is get some of those board offs out of there. Metapag, I guess Craig Anderson is no longer with him, is that right? No, that's a wrong station. Sir Craig Anderson's an IOD. That'd be a program, correct? Sir, if you can't get this guy wants to give you a P.D. You want to be a P.D.? For sure. Sounds like a station, man. Hiring. I'm hired. You got it. This is fantastic. I know you'll have the real competition. Let's see. Where the hell is IOD? Did they make the list? I don't know. Here's somewhere. They don't ask the last sheep. They fell off the page. On a way, man. Let's see. They had a 205 in midday in a 2.6 in a night. They had a resounding 3.5 with a baseball. I think they have to understand. They have told you a time and time again that ratings do not count. Rating is not the important thing. It's substance is not. When you had their numbers, you keep saying it over and over again too. No, that's true. But listen, maybe there's something other than ratings than radio anyway. Maybe there's something beyond the horizon. There's somebody can seek out, rather than trying to get the freaking numbers. Yeah, there's a word for you. Everyone's gone? Failure. Okay, let's go to Hollywood, hello. Neil. Yeah. First of all, congratulations. Thank you. That's your gain in my loss because I got it. I've got a company car with only AM radio and I never listened to AM until then. And since then, I've been addicted to you. And I guess I'm going to have a look for another company car and then you're going to have to. Well, let me ask you this question. Why would you just get like a, I don't know what to tell me. Get a Sony Walkman because that's your legal. You can't do that in the car. But you can get like another radio. You could put in the car, right? I'm going to have to do something because I can't live without you. I love what you look so pretty. I've had a problem with this for the past couple of days and a couple of the colors. And you've reiterated this time and time again. And you did it again at the track last night. And there's still, I can't listen to you because I only have AM in the car. But you're on at a time when there's still home. Yeah, they're getting ready for for you. Are you in the car at six o'clock in the morning? I'm calling for my car now. No, but wait a minute. What is that? Are you responding? There you go. What's going to be read by lips? Are you in your car at six o'clock in the morning? No, I'm not. What time do you get in the car? 7, 7, 30. Okay, 7, 30. So in a meantime, it's like what time do you get up? Well, I can listen to you for the first hour. Hour and a half. And then you'll have to go on by an FM radio. Just so. Okay. Not a nice pencil. Go to sound advice. Anyway, congratulations. And I will be trying to melting pot. Thanks to you. Okay. Thanks a lot. Okay. You want to tell the people when we're going to be there tonight? I'll let's see. We're going to be there at about 12 o'clock. Just after midnight. Okay. Let's see if it's normal. Go ahead. Hi. You do what have you seen? You were saying today today, Barney Chance? Inquiring minds want to know, sir. If the John Johnson article. Somebody already beat you to it. With a full-color picture, right? Yeah. Somebody called about that. Okay. I want you to feel better, but at 35 cents a minute, you know, let's not get carried away. Dan already has the office. Yeah. Favorite. Stan is already counting the pubic hairs in the picture. They told you what he had to say about the Harold, right? No. He said, let's see if it's on the second page. It says, you didn't want to move to Miami because you didn't want to live in the same town as the Miami and Harold, the paper that brought down Jerry Hart's campaign by sticking out his Washington DC townhouse. I like John. I've always liked that. Yeah, John. My favorite show. Okay, Don, you've come. Okay. Thanks, John. Sir. Back in the great. John. I like that. John Johnson. Where's some of those John Johnson? I want you to make sure, first record Monday morning on say to Don Johnson, boy, he's got some heavy stuff. Okay, we have another celebrity call or back by popular demand. What do you want? Yes. What? The funding. Yes. Welcome to my world. I want to tell you something. If our program director ever gets a hold of your young body boy, there will be nothing left. I'm coming that way. Because he had a weight like an extra 20 minutes to get the numbers because you had a computer tied up you jerk. I wasn't me though. Everybody else. Okay. Or just playing a flavor. Yeah, I know. Okay. What do you want? We got all the hearing from Robert Trong. You went. Glenn had a 15-chair and average, average crackles per hour. Yeah. He's in a class by himself. We know it. I wanted to find out. I can't for some reason. I can't get seven to midnight. What did I do, Don? IOD. IOD. Let's see. IOD had a 3.5 at night. What else do you want? I'll read them all to you. We got a lot of code to do. Do you see how XD J and Joe knuckles this? Are they on here? Yes, XD J..5 and Joe. Why does your voice keep changing? Hello, Neil. I have a cotton Dominion. Where it didn't get held? How about you, W, and then how to point. Where is this? I can't find a page. It's got such numbers. Well, where the hell is he looking? Down there. Look. I don't want to see it. It's disgusting. I'm just a public. Let's see. Here's RBD, VcG, XDJ with a .5. Big number. W, W, and N. A point four. That's the Neil. That must be the Neil factory. Neil, Neil. That must be the Neil factory. Actually, I want to say that, see, part of that was when I was programming over there. In the change of format, I put on just nonstop all these. Oh, yeah. No jokes or anything. So the part of that, it's the only reason they got that much for the summer was because of that. Where the hell is KAT on here? Yes. Two points. Oh, boy. They made the right. Exactly. Yes. By the way, King did have a two six and I told you, you're incorrectly. Well, I'm so sorry. I apologize. Okay. Will you accept my apology? Yes. And don't forget the early bird gets the worm on the computer. Okay. There are many things that Mark Kuna think you're too. Ah. Ah. The numbers before Mark Kia. Yeah. I was always molasses from here. No, he did. That's our what he's panformed to. Better to wait for. Then you can save her. You know, you can save her the flavor of these wonderful numbers. And Lee will be taking this too. And just branding it on his chest. Look at that. The only two in the young history of Zeta. Right. Which I want to write to what 400 people in the one program director. Oh, there's a possible solely for that too in the afternoon. Oh, I don't see any more. Like, like, rod certainly. He does look like rod certainly. How is he? More and more. He's the crispy. He's the smoke. He's the smoke. The milk is very hiding in the distance. Hey, listen, if I had these numbers, I'd be hiding too. But that's going to change Peter. Yeah, that'll change. We'll get that one. What was it in the morning again? I don't want to keep rubbing it. I don't want to. One, two. We'll get that up to a one four by. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. I don't want to. Yeah. Yeah. Give us a little time. Would you please don't expect miracles. I'll call from Lake Worth. Hello. Hello, Neil. Congratulations. What have you been kidnapped and taken to Lake Worth? No, unfortunately I was bored here. Oh, boy. You were bored there? Yeah, still alive. Oh, I don't blame you. I think Mr. Ego over it. Leave it walking dead. And on demise over there. What? The world intent on demise. Oh, yeah. I think he had the scoop on the ratings because he has had this campaign going for about three. Weeks. Yeah, it's really helped a lot. I'll think of the septic tag. I says, too. That's it. And I have one question. Does WWNN stand for? We're willy next to Neil. That's it. Okay. Okay. That's the Neil factor. Don't forget it. All right. Okay. Now let's see who's next to us on FM 94.9 93.9. Of course. So that's the Donald factor which is speaks for itself. New age station that WXDJ is. 575. 95. 95. 95. I have 1.7. So we're surrounded by total mediocrity on science. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. That's right. I wonder why Zeta isn't as loud as we used to be. I don't want to start. I haven't even started loud on the dial. Oh, it is very loud on the dial. It is. Yeah. I think it's got this. Lashes 100,000 watts signal. That's what he's like. That's what he's like. I've got it. I have it. I have it. I'm just doing that because he's sitting up to get him started on the right foot, you know, very defensive always make the P.D. real defensive. And I got the numbers right here boy. And you want to be defensive. Baby. Let me tell you. Are you sure you don't want to be considered there was a certain improvement area. You're sure that's not too late. I haven't signed anything. We can never know. Jail go back into his hole in there. And there will. Just be one happy family continue right on here. Unless and you can sell a lot of that stuff in the eight track room, boy. There's a lot of things to do. I'm going to be having a little sale Sunday at the Thunderbird Drive. I'm going to summarize Boulevard. Boy. I speak of the devil. Look at that. There's the man who bought it all right there. Stand in this partner in crime, ladies and gentlemen. Talk about what she's engineer. Talk again about why the station is in his loudest way. Wait until Rick Edwards finds out that we didn't want to reveal that we're going to have a four man show. But Dave Murray from Tampa is going to be our fourth man on the show. So look out. Okay, it's 12 minutes before one at WI and Z. We just want to mention that because we know Dave's got a lot of relatives and family in town. And after he spent the weekend in my house last week and even beg me to talk about him a lot. We'll come back Bob. Don't let them disrupt the show. Okay, just tell him to screw off and ignore that. We'll come back. Okay, it's 10 before one at WI and Z. And Lee was just telling us that his girlfriend has a speech impediment with show. Just a little joke. Just a little joke. Just a little joke. Look at it. I said happy. Look at that. That would really. That would clinch it. Okay, are you ready? But. Come on. Oh, that was good. It's good. Oh, he really does. Good boy. What? How about me? You know, you're working with two boys. They're trying to circumvent us. They're watermelon. Unbelievable. Miami. Hello. Great. Great. This is Mike. I'm from Pembrook. Right down the block. Oh, boy. Are you lucky? Live in what? This is great. Yeah. I had to tell you congratulations to you move to Zeta. Thank you. I'll miss you in the afternoon, but we're here in the morning. Right. I got recorded to take no problem. Sure. And you got an FM radio? Absolutely. Oh, one of these guys who has no problems. Isn't this a breath of fresh air? I like all these calls today. People's big problem. Oh, yeah. They're all in the air. They don't have an FM radio. Sure. What are we going to do with this? What? Are you doing blind? Oh, great. He said, how you doing? I'm sorry. Is that a tough question? Yeah. That's something simple. Listen, I was a lovely laboratory. They got to say a lot of couple people. Okay. They're doing Jack. Rich. Steve. What's going on? Okay. Now, FCC regulation, you know, makes that illegal service. I don't know. Oh, they're coming to tell me away. Okay. Oh, oh. You know something? I've never seen you kneel and Brian, nor cross at the same time. Well, you got to meet caught with my weather material. Oh, my. With my radar done. Okay, listen, have a wonderful life in tempered pines. All right, congrats. And made a good news, viewers. I'm going to ask a little bit of that back down here. Give Brian a second. You're lucky that this fades out. Hi, sir. I'm back. We have to ask Linda Patilla when she comes back in here. For Brian, I'm going to dress up as the ferry again. This Christmas on the water. You know, the weather weather. The weather. In that green you are, you are, you're a troll. You know what? I'm going to discuss things. He's a trouble maker. Yeah. Big trouble. And got them. Our next call is from Pompano Park, Rastrak, home of America's finest harness racing. Who is this? I'm a person that's getting divorced because of today's broadcast. It seemed that my wife picked up the ray of turn on AM the old OREM station. And she heard that our is out for six AM or I'm done home yet. So what else is no Alan? Why would somebody do that to my happily married life? And I'm locked out of a house. Well, I knew this guy had some good stories, but this is the best. This is not no lie. I mean, I'm not gonna lie. Speak well. Zero is nice to have you here last night. You won't be able to get rid of us now. And I don't want to get rid of you. We won $28.60 per year. So you'll never be able to get rid of me. I asked a man of these words from six to ten. When you hear a normal guy six to ten, you think is it night? He made a normal guy. Yeah. Since when was I ever a normal guy, Alan?

Well, the minute so did my hometown. I mean, many athletes. I root for them this year. But how about them, birds, boy? How about the birds? When is partial to the birds? I think we're going to have a ball bird. You're going to have a ball bird. You're going to have a ball bird. You might have best to bill a fee. And if there's anybody wants a little tip on Pomp and O'Parr. Just bet on Bill Faye because he's going to be winning like crazy. And if we want to have British crown Sunday night for $500,000, he knows where that finish line is. Well, he should have done his good. And I'm glad you said that because he should be the top one. Him and I Jill said Ron. Yep. Like the top one this year. And making it in comeback, yeah. So we don't know where he'll be. He broke the collarbone. Really? Yeah. And with talking about Nicky, you make that go. And he, uh, we hope it will be a three way type. And that, that Peter Renn and Tommy Harmon has been showing yet.

That's absolutely cool. And when he races, and you go home with 20 bucks. But there was the one race that I blew. I changed my mind at the window and it cost us, you know, about 360 bucks a piece.

You sound good. Yeah. I question about the ratings. I know that the numbers have a lot to do with advertising. But if you got a seven or an eight, does that mean that you make as the honor of personality who got the ratings three or four times more money than the people who got a one or two? No. Why not? Well, that's a good question. Would you like to bring Gary Lawrence in here? We'll ask him that together. Well, why not? Let's put the guy on the spot. Yeah. That's what I say. Why not? Yeah. That's wrong with you. You seem kind of a cheap skate Gary. Yeah. You're right. Because I'm a soft touch. Do you, uh, do you, uh, sign a contract or yeah? On a day by day basis there? Yeah, but I think after this call, I'm not going to sign it, you know? I like that day by day. Yeah. Day by day. You're having a good idea. And when the next, when the next trend comes out, we're doing a five there in a morning. All three of us are going to go in there and say, okay, smart guy, what do you do now? Yeah. And they'll say, I'll read the dirt. Why would you get a good rock? Thanks a lot. Okay. One thing about this company man, they never repent. You know what I mean? Like, hey, you want to go? Bye.

I mean, you know, there's too so many different languages. And when they wanted. When a Polk wanted the off and kneel. He would point to you. Ha ha ha ha ha. And they would point to stand there. Well, I was standing there. Yeah. That was a classic. You know that the Lord even loves kneel Rogers. Go ahead, sir. Glenn, we're good luck to you when you go to your new position. Thank you.

If you want to know what position you're going to be in Monday, I do have a book of schematics for that. Oh, no. Come on. Let's keep it clean. Okay. Listen. I've got to congratulate you. And another thing. My favorite card, which you haven't played in central time, which I think is appropriate here since you are moving to new station. Yes. I think it just fits so well. The card says. I'll wiggle. Oh. Last from the past. Where is that baby? That's the best one you guys have ever used. Right below. We're on the ring. Bring that baby down. What? Bring it down. I just happened to have that card right here. And this is kind of like Russian rule that now does two cuts on. One of them says Adios. And the other says, Oh, still away going off. This one says, Oh, still away goes here. We have a big prize for you. Okay. Perfect. Adios. Oh. It's like wheel of fortune. I can send you copy that book if you want it. It's in 3D. Okay. I can't wait to see it. Okay. One closing part. Come at. We try to control it. Try to control it. Go ahead. Sir. Yes, sir. I'm not late. Yeah. Look at this. Now we have a dilemma here because we have a mobile and we have a NASA, a mobile and that's a big dilemma. Then mobile. This is the mobile but not from NASA. That's okay. Thank God. I got two things for you. Okay. But I got to ask you to do me favor. I'll be glad they serve. They're running large. But thank you anyway. I want to take your ratings off the scale. Okay. Morning. But the person. I'd rather get me off the scale in the morning. You got to get your meat off the scale? That's it. Number one. I called it before. And from plumbing specialties. Like, you know, if you want to get your pot. Oh yeah. You called me before today, right? Yeah, but I got something else for you. It's been a while. I'm going to better make it snappy because you know, once the king always thinks. Okay. You want somebody to work in your plumb. You got to talk to Mac. Number one. It's Mac and plumbing specialties. No, but still. What do I have for it, too? Yeah. This guy's getting another commercial. Nasa. Hello. Hey, Neil. Why did you put that drink on the head of me? Well, I'm asking myself that right now. Yeah. I'm so sorry. Hi, bird. Hi. How's everything in Nasa? Hey, we love you over here. Yeah. We're going to miss you guys. I got a bomb. Mama for you. I got one for Stan too. She's just two years old. Oh, come on. Perfect. Sir. Neil, one week. Yeah. And you say, Stanley. Oh, Stanley. Okay, Arlene. Thanks a lot. How were they? We know we're sticking out her and training. What do you mean the track again? What is going on here? Hello. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. Who's that? Michael. Oh, I got a troll. Oh, I got a troll. This world's working. I got a troll for Compton. The biggest guy in the history of mankind. You're like the next night, Trud. I know. You're the only person who can throw this race track over 18,000 plus people. Yeah. Hold your breath. Oh. But we need it. And Neil, right? We have nine at the race track. Good luck to you. And you can throw it up. 18,000 people right now. You can. Okay. Well, let's have an e-arage as Memorial Race first. And then I'll think about it. Everybody loves you at the race track. All my friends don't value everybody does. Well, I'll tell Jess. I said hello. We're doing a minute. Like sure. When Neil gets you over to the FM, we'll get you those grateful dead tickets. Tell him I got my pilot, my parking, so no more valet. Okay. I heard about that. Do you look at your last night out there? Well, tell him don't hold their breath. Okay. I think my pink right tickets when you're at that. Oh, right. Oh, right. There he goes. Okay, Mike. Okay. Thank God. See you at Highlight. This guy trolled everyone. I know. I believe him. He's friends with everybody. Mike is a Trudy J. Ray. Of course, Alan brought him up there at the track. And now he's paying the price for it. That's it. Shameless. You're a shameless. I think about Mike is he can go to Highlight, dogs, Pompano, all on the same night and he'll be at all free. I've been free for years. That's all. I don't want him free for me. Why is unbelievable? Gambling all of Alan's money away is disgusting. Pompano, hello. Hello. Yes. Neil? Yes. I hope I heard you on the radio last weekend talking that you might need an alarm in your new house. I'd like for you to call us off the air. My husband owns a booklor alarm company. Really? Yes. I don't even need an alarm in my house? Uh-huh. No, I don't think so. That must have been the Steve Canesho. No. He was waiting for the book to come out. No, I think she and now they're all alarmed in his house. How come the level like this is just dropped out of the sky? How does that happen up there? Do you have any idea? No, I do. No, I do. I just dropped out of the sky like it's in half. You don't have to worry about that after you're here. That's right. I'm really pissed. Yeah. That's it. Well listen, I appreciate this sentiment, but what can I tell you? No, I don't know. Congratulations on your new move. Thank you. Can we count on you? I suppose. Well, not don't get bored. That was kind of a loophole. Yeah, of course. Who in the ass? A little tentative there. A little loopworm. You have to be able to beat out panor in the morning now. I would think so, yeah. Yeah. All right. Okay. Thanks. Bye-bye. That's so sure about her. Yeah. Questionable. A questionable event. And now that's that guy with another plug for his plumbing company. Yeah. You don't know if I'd want them putting an alarm in it. Bubble. Yeah. Yeah. What a good connection. This is, yes. Hi, Judy. Hi, Judy. I can barely hear you. Where are you calling from St. Augustine? I'm on an 95 in Miami. Wow. Well, no wonder it sounds like they're coming. Yeah. Why can you get back in the car and call on the phone, Judy? Is your top down, Judy? Why? Can you hear me? Yeah. Sounds like you're under the car working on it. Oh, I'm in the car. A stung just bounced up and smashed my windshield. And there's a little air coming in. Oh, boy. Are you serious? Are you serious? Are you very bright not my day and call you? Boy, boy, what, you know, once that happens, I don't want to get you to eat it. But, well, the world that you're going to get up at 4th or 8 in the morning. Very simple, Judy. Let me give you a little flow. I'll set my alarm clock. The little beeper will go off. I'll look at it. I'll get up. I'll jump out of bed. Just like I do every day now. No, no, no. She said, how you going to get up? You've been up at 4th or 30 in the morning. Listen, I've got a month. I know how the bird's going to get up. I mean, the only bird's always get up. Yeah, I know where it gets to worm. I'm able to stay awake to eat it all the way through. Well, this phone, this is a connection. It sounds like she's calling for an airplane. Yeah. Are you there? We're here. I have to hear about you, Judy. Well, congratulations again. Thanks again. I just bought this mobile phone last week, so I could call you. Well, I would take it back. Come to get. I don't think they'll take it back. Tom, the straightened it out. Okay. Congratulations. Thank you. Bye. Bye. Boy, I'm glad you didn't mention the company. You know, I didn't have that call with sound on FM. I had the strangest mobile call. The guy, the guy, it was a connection like that. And the guy said, wait a minute. Let me put my son rough back. And he put the son rough back. And you could hear him fine. Now, that does make it a sense. Again, Ted is setting on the road. Right? Wait a minute. What is he doing? He's going to be here coming in. No, no. Outside, no. What did Sonny do in the morning again? He did a 42 and tenor to 44. It's close. I think, Jenny, I read the wrong number. We're in generally a 44 beats of 42, right? Yeah, but it's going to close. What? But Sonny, I'm sure has a higher cum, or something. He'll let me say. Let's see, as 186, eight. Yeah, he has a little bit higher cum. But nobody cares about cum. I know. They sonny. You know, the interesting part of it is, let's see, cum. Uh, tenors got 178, three. What is my cum on here? 183, three. Yeah. Almost the same as Sonny's. Yeah, he always said. That he has bigger ratings than you. Yeah. Even though he's in the 4th year this, during any quarter hour, how many people are listening to Sonny box? There. Uh, oh. Right. 28,500. 28,500. And how many are listening to this show? 53,300. Hmm. About, uh, which one is generally a little higher? 53,000. Oh, oh. This is another mobile, is it? Is that the one from before? The guy is selling plum. It is another one. Marvel. Marvel. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Are you doing today? Okay. All right. I'm calling Marvel too. We found better than the last lady. Yeah, a little bit. Okay. Let me tell you. Do me a favor before you go over to the FM. You got to do the morons. Is it tribute to Rick, uh, to Rick Shaw, the morons, the society. Just one more time. We do? You got to do it. Can you do that? More time. I was listening to it on this already. You heard me turn it radio. Come on, Neil. What's up there? Do you hear what you tell did? Uh, that's the kind of stuff that we strive for. Okay. Good luck to you. That's what everybody wants to hear the stuff. Yeah. Well, now, so, look, all you're painting the ass people into Bahamas and mobile phones. Go away when you're costing them. I'd like to have at least a couple of people this hour we can understand. You know, that would be a step at a right direction. Wow. What? What? What? What? What? You know, I thought you might call out here at the middle of the hall. It's a thing of fire. What? What? Brutal. Brutal. Just brutal. Yeah. Really? You're going to be a good one. I can't say good to say good to Bahamas. I beg your pardon. Why wouldn't they be able to get say to the Bahamas? They can't with a special, uh, can't we? Too far. They don't get any diaries down there. What tell the week here about them? Look, this is a business. You know, remember that jerk that was calling before, there's something beyond the rating. There's this, uh, nebulous, uh, you know, he, he's out. It just like the guy who's going to come on in about 47 minutes on another station. And start all abying about how ratings be nothing and. There's a pair. And I look, you know, I have a good conscience. Clirconscience when I go home at night. Look at the mirror. Just want to make a good living for my family. Yeah, right. I think I might pay check. I eat well. Yeah. Yeah. A lot of free meals. You bet free movies. Everything's going. Yeah, isn't he? And we'll be critic too on the side. What he tells a minute. Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk about it on the end. I'm telling you the level on this thing has dropped off the end of the world. I don't know what happened back there. But I'm worried about it. Okay. Trust me. I'm not talking about here. I'm talking about the monitor. Probably when all those engineers were up there before they were putsching around with the stuff again, you know, they can as soon as I see Rick Edwards up there. I know. I know that the world is crumbling around by feet. Okay. What did you do something? Oh, is that a little better? Well, I really. Okay. I'm going to be a little bit more precise. I'm going to be a little bit more precise. Everybody's out of here just momentarily. You know, I should thank the audience out there because they've been tremendous and they've been loyal and they've taken a lot of pain and abuse and derision and they've suffered through all of the, you know, monkey business and Portland main and everything else. And it really been great. And, you know, it's it's fitting that the book should come out today, or at least the, the number should come out for the summer book. Because this is it on a AM or at least tomorrow will be. And it's for a week they show this is it. And in the last of three rating books, we had about a seven, a nine and a seven, five share in the middle of the day here on a day part on a radio station that used to be like a dead in the water, DED. Okay. With incredible demographics and the thousands and thousands of living and breathing people. And amazingly enough, not only were we number two and midday of all the stations, AM and FM and the whole South Florida market behind life lists, but also in kill. And I know I said a moment ago, nobody pays any attention to kill, but it is interesting that that's the other number that everybody loves to talk about, well, we had a big kill. Well, we had almost 200,000 people in our kill. You don't want to say only the life be this midday and we beat almost every other morning show. How do you like that? In fact, life just a minute, just relax. I know you're very emotional. Very emotional. I'll trade my kill for my share and he's all right. I agree with you. But it's nice to have both of them. It's nice to have big Q and 2 because that means you're reaching a tremendous number of people. What is that? Excellent letter. You'll want to read that. Okay. Unbelievable. They wanted the burden to have 20 fingers. Isn't it cute? Boa, but you're going to just go and play with that now. Give up Brian in the ice cream shop. The real action is at high school swim meets. What a disgusting letter sir. Absolutely. Really? Go ahead. Last week my guide son aged 17 asked me to come watch him swim at a high school meet in Tampa. Go ahead. My god, the visible sweetness is all walking around in tiny tiny swim suits. So many so little time. What a disgusting pederist. I read the last time. By the way, I sure thought I said he'd go. That's what I said. That's what I said. So many so little time. By the way, as I was saying before, I was so rudely interrupted. I believe. Okay. I don't know what's going to start getting sensitive. Would you please? You know, just as a drop of a horse and I certainly wish that you'd go to FM radio during the summer when we have frequent lightning and thunderstorms in South Florida. Your transmission is practically wiped out this far north. This is West Palm. FM would give us static free reception. Think about it. Palm Beach County enjoys your radio. Please keep it up. Keep up the good work. Henry and West Palm Beach. Thank you Henry. When original idea. Yeah. What a good idea. Look at a girl called Linda Thark. What? She called. Oh boy. I'm not going to turn that down. Yeah. She gave us. We heard Joe's working last Saturday night. Maybe she'd like to go get some fun. Linda told me that she wouldn't touch the best party. Okay. Miami. Hello. Hello. And when I told her what a wife she said she's not into ears. Go ahead, sir. Okay. Neil. I want to ask you a question. What kind of curie do you have for your mobile phone? Yeah. You have to tell you the one. Bells. Oh, your mobile phone. What do I know? I just put it. I haven't even looked at it yet. Okay. Well, if I'm at busy. I've been to the track. Okay. Well, if you have to tell you the one. You have to see that you're going to get a little statement. They're facing out little third quarters and all kinds of goody stuff inside. What do you think is on the front of it? Your. Don Johnson. No. Your friend Greg Budeau. Oh my god. You're a runner-up. I know. Wow. All 94 are the boat crews. And there he is between two fat ladies. Just favor it. But a background of Levin. Is one of the name Donald? No. This Rubin and you've got another one who is. Or she. Rubin? A lady named Rubin and Donald. It's a new team. That's correct. Well, I can't wait. I'll be holding my breath. It's a good time for the great taste. Thanks a lot. Okay. Sunrise. Hello. Yes. How you doing, Ruth? I'm pretty good on Neil. Who's on your board? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you? I'm just going to say it's only, right? By the way, talking that went down from a 75 to a 49 is that correct? Is my memory. Right? Yeah. Well, I think it's because of Sally Jussi's wish he got to me. Yeah. Wait till you see it's skyrocket. Now that she's gone. Oh, you know, I got tired of that broad stick of her glasses in my face. Yeah. I've got bigger glasses of Sally Jussi up to. She's the only person in the world. I know puts lipstick on her frames over glasses. It's gross. Oh, you're ugly. I don't care. I didn't visit. Oh, I know. Let's not start with those TV people again. I have to rewrite a message from Ron Johnson. Oh, boy. Can't wait. Nick, Neil Rogers, Miami Vite. Freeze. As no, Neil. As said, oh. What? What? Major said, Neil, looking at the dark night. Well, we'll be looking at the camera. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, sir. I just did not ready for that. I did it. I did it. I'm in too much of a euphoric mood at the moment. I can't bring myself to that level. Actually, they don't know you. But Monday morning, we're going to lock ourselves in and play this for three hours. Hmm. Babies. St. Yste Peter, the window outside. I think he's curious to win. Oh, cool. To be locking himself in the executive job. Yeah. Look up. 27 till two at WI and Z. We have a caller from Magnificent Coral Springs, hello. Yes, hello. How are you, over there? How are you, my good friend? I'm at work. We listen every day over here in Coral Springs. Do you really? Yes. Well, a little while ago, I heard Stan mentioned that he had a mobile caller that had to open the roof. Oh, yeah. Okay. I can tell you why. Some of the mobile phones have an antenna on the roof. Then it doesn't matter naturally. Correct. There's also portable units where the antenna is mounted on the transmitter itself, which would be inside the car. Ah, so in other words, it depends on where you're being mounted. Exactly. I got it. It's a steel roof vehicle. It'll hold the RF inside the car. So, in other words, you should always open your sunroof before you mount it. Well, if the antenna is mounted on the outside of the car, it doesn't matter, but if it's a portable where some of the units can be carried around, you can walk down town with a take it on both. Now those have the antenna mounted on the transmitter. Why are you going to mount them? So, you know, I know it's units. You have to make sure there's no steel in between the... Well, you shouldn't steal if you should buy one. Yeah, right. But I just figured I'd call because I heard you mentioned before you were wondering why the guy had to open the roof. Excellent. That's a good thing. This has been a learning experience. You know, Neil, it must be real health for those that don't have a sunroof. Yeah. Oh, yeah. If you're close enough, it'll go through the windows, and that would be good enough. But I guess the guy was far away, and he didn't have the power to go. Well, a lot of people that listen to the show that Neil's found over the years are pretty far away. You haven't noticed that. Yeah. Like another planet. Okay, thanks a lot sir. You're finished, all right. I was co-shed. Been co-shed, boss, and cool. Candle, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Congratulations. Thank you so much. Hopefully you are to you, and I think Stan will do a hell of a job, and that's not that he's doing well. I mean, no continues. Well, I have to start working a little bit now. Hey, you know that guy from the outside to try to do our lean. Oh, yeah. His voice wasn't deep enough. I know. And by the way, uh, and his butt wasn't big enough. Yeah, you, ooh. Well, no, no, his behavior usually had big butts. Yeah, they do as a matter of fact. We're going to be doing a show on that on Zeta next time. Big butt behavior? Yep. On the three-bees. Yep. I get up at six every day, and then I wake up around 16. So I'll be listening to you guys, you know, Monday to Friday. For a boy, isn't that marvelous? That's fantastic. That's my friend. This is our second caller now, who isn't all been out of shape, but under he's a... Well, I'm just an guy, something. This person, I see, understands it. Yeah. Six in the morning. You know, it was where the big hand is in a little hand. It's perfect timing. Yeah. That's the good news. The bad news is. Yes. I don't have an A-M. I mean, an SM in my car. So I'd never had to worry about it because I always listen to A-M. Well, I got news for you. Everybody that maybe we can get our friends at Sound Advice to do like A-S. FM, special, you know what I'm saying? Me or under Steve? Yeah. It's a great idea. Where are most people at Binsons? 97. I thought every radio in the world. I mean, even if you go to one of those cheapy stink or renegart places, the radio in a car has got an FM on it. Even at Snappy. Well, that's not going to work. I grab a company car and it just comes with a standard stuff. Well, I'll tell him to get a wheel. I've got to go out now and buy a radio, but hey, I think it's well worth it. Yeah, I would think so. It's plain to him. It's 1987. Yeah. Four hours of enjoyment in the morning for what 30 bucks for you. Tell him you don't speak Spanish. That'll punch it for you. Oh, you'll tell you anytime you can buy four hours of enjoyment so for 30 or 40 bucks, that's something. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Is this bill? And that even take my pants off. Is this bill? Yeah. No bill. I'm putting it. Oh, my. Oh, my. What is this? Did you listen to me over there? Of course. I'm glad you came in and said hello. Do you have a feeling we lost control of the show just seconds ago? I don't mind leaving. Oh, how you been? Yeah, I've got a song. Joe. Joe. That's the only one that's never ready to ruin. Joe, Ian. Yeah. I mean, it is weird, but some people in the building do listen to already. That's interesting. She doesn't have a telephonitor desk. Yeah. And she has a phone at her desk. I know this is revolutionary. I know I call her all the time, but you know I was listening to you guys now. And I figured I put my two cents. Is your half in no bill, Joe, Ian? Oh, yeah. Real well. Steve. How well, Bill. How well. Bill, hey. Come on. Let's have an honest answer. Well, put it this way. I'll back him up, but I won't stand behind. Oh. Okay. I think that answered the question. Okay, Bill, have a great life. Do one more thing. Do that Joey thing with the, you know, simple. No. Okay. Well, right behind that. You should have played. A mountain John. I packed my bag less. Might inflate. Hey, that's excellent. Okay. We'll work on it, Bill. There, guys. I'll read the dirt. I'll read the dirt. I Joey. Okay. These guys from the Salvoes boy. They know how to do it upright. They don't screw around. They got enough pizza here. Oh, right. Half of Sicily. Look at this. You guys. I'm telling you. Look at this. Tons of pies. Holy. Tell you. Thank you. How do we say thank you? Okay. These Salvoes. I have that spectacular Italian food with a, When are you finishing with your, edition? Are you working on it? Really? Boy. Oh, boy.

Write it on the log and you'll get yours. Okay. You'll get yours. All right. Three big pies here. Okay. That's, again, you're a little bit. I'll let you share it with the rest of the world. It's the last faster weekday show. This will be a better little enjoy this. Somebody's on this damn thing. It'll never happen again. Maybe I can't use to it. Last pizza call in the talk to you. I have pizza call. Ever. Oh yeah. Look at that one. You're not going to be doing this, sorry. You're going to be a... Well, because I know you don't share. I saw the way you, uh... No, no, no. I came to eat. By the way, you know my friend Nick that you met at the track list. Yes. I'm telling you, the door. I used to be... I used to be upset about the dress code and the clubhouse to make your jacket a part of. I like the dress code now. I wish they would force everybody to wear a kick-a-mod like they used to. Because now they let all like my degenerate friends in. I notice our people. And that Nick, man. He is really a piece of... Look at this guy. Thank you, guys. Hey. Have you got five pieces there, Max? What is busy working on the FMI? Do you want to get that signal a little louder? Will you, Max? What kind do you want, Neil? We got three different kinds. I like you. I like the sausage. I like the sausage. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Let's eat. Boy, boy, boy. Hey, there we go. Oh, listen to me. Our leans. Oh, oh, oh. Yeah, look at him. He's regurgitating on that. He's just foaming at the mouth. What do you say? You don't like anchovies? Oh, look at that. Oh, my God. Does that look good? The audience is getting tired of hearing us eat on the air. So you know what? Let's do it anyway. Well, Monday you're not going to be eating anymore. Boy, is that good? And this one's got everything on it. Pepper, onion, pepperoni. Where's my napkin, please. Thank you. Oh, boy, is that good? Let's stop eating. Yeah. I'm going to take it back and put it in the freezer. Here comes Gina. She's going to have a little piece. Hmm. I wish I had an interesting piece. Stand up and have a little piece. But that's going to really run out of shore. Is that your part? No, we don't do that to Gina. Gina is okay in our book. You've always been okay in our book. So when you give me that copy, you know. We're not going to be doing that anymore. I think if you play a song, Johnson record you would do two birds with one stone. Look at this man. Send me one all the way from Bob. You know, this guy is going to shameless shameless. I bet you even Rick Edwards would eat some of this. Okay, now if you give Rick a piece, let me take care of it first. You know what I'm saying? We're a little surprised for Rick. Just a joke, you know, come on, lighten up. No, you guys from South Carolina. You don't understand? No, you don't understand? Isn't that where he's from? Yeah, oh boy. Look out. Okay, I think what we're going to do is eat a little more here first. I think I got to play a Don Johnson record. I got news for you. We don't play records to fill time so we can eat on this show. No, but that would be cool. Then he would call for sure. Oh, you don't have him already. I know you have gone on him yet. That's the thing. I would think that after all the action, Major's had last few days. He'd finally get over that, but he just keeps playing to that. You would go, Linda can't go with us to the restaurant bottle. Linda Thornton? She goes to the one in Kendall. Who invited her? I did. Pardon me, because Joe's got to work. Oh, yeah, that would be nice. We're out of the time. I thought, yeah, but she would be with me. What is she doing? She's doing her collar. Oh, come on, Linda. Yeah, pretty big, pretty big excuse. Come on, Linda. I would keep you safe because Stan's going to have the lady friend with him there. So I would keep you very safe. She just doesn't want to see me. It'd be seen in public with me because then it would, you know, create the impression of another one of these in southwest relation. Oh, like with Tom. Oh, yeah. So we'll bring Linda and Tom. How's that? We could make it a business launch. As I understand, there's a certain morning guy in town who has an impact as the enemy comes in here. Lily is the best at Lilland around. She had to forget about Is she going to say anything? Look at this. The one for Rick is the one I need in there. The one with little things crawling around on it. Take some for your engineer. Well, I'm going to go out and just go nuts now. You don't have to be in a feeding frenzy. How are we doing this? What do you imagine the phones that light up at the pizza places around when we start to in your intake? And what did you say before about TJ Simmons about the roles that when we mentioned at the other day that they had a business, they were nuts. People were coming in from all over the Bahamas. Yes. You heard listening, clear and plain that they helicopter on a dayglass. I'm serious on a roof. By the way, just we are having a good time. It's a great show. We have some of those speakers from Zeta. We're up here. A waitem and up confused. I mean, our good friends from Zeta, we're up here. I'm going to go to the identity crisis at this point. And Gary of course came in to congratulate us on our 75th and midday in our final AM book. Not bad, huh? Not right. 75. Number one, spite of all the terrible things you've said about him. And Gary, I got a 15 and every tackle for our, by the way, Stan has a little package for you later. It's got two twinkies in a cigar and a story. I'm sorry. But Mr. Millionaire over there, Mr. Rigo, I keep looking at that number and I say, it's got to be a mistake because I know that not that many people are listening to them. We're back to us. That's who's six. We got to figure that up. Figure that out in terms of dollars as they say in Pittsburgh dollars. How much they pay for it? Isn't Mike McKay saying that? Hey, Paul. So hard to pay for listening. Yeah. Who's six? Well, no, how much they pay for each listener? Boy, what a future number. Hmm. Okay, I think we're going to take another break now just for the hell of it. This could make during the week on AM. Okay. So for those of you who keep track of these things and keep your own log at home, market very special. There is no. Yeah, Bob's on a listen line right now. It was Gary Bob Earth. Okay. Okay, that got him on a hearing of her. Well, okay, wait a minute. We have another celebrity caller on 135 and it is. Oh, you're just not going to tell me. Okay. It's coming through now long distance. This could be a big call. Like could be a grandpa, aluus, the Howard Sternsho. Oh, so. I think we could get grandpa's number from Howard Stern. That would be great. Sure. Why not? Okay. It says 134, you want it? Okay. Here we go. There's a special call. Hello? Hello? Yes. It's a Tanner. Tanner. That's a little hot ball. It's a Tanner. Good. Congratulations, Bill. I'm thinking it all banana mouth and a lot. Thank you, Neil. Enjoy what you can. You're going to do great. And you have somebody should say before you get off to say it, radio station, that you've done a number on this market. What do you say that again? And I can't say which number. But you have a lot to be proud of. Now, you're going to do well on this station. How could you not do well on that? Exactly. I ought to do at least a nine or ten on FM. But we're not in competition. I mean, you're playing all that ethnic scratch stuff. You know, so we're safe. I probably think you're about right on that. I think probably we tend to lose the least. But I do think that it's going to have a profound effect on one thing that I think it's going to change the way that people think about talk radio in this market. I would agree with you wholeheartedly. So I wish you a lot of luck and I congratulate you on the job that you've done so far. It's definitely been a precedent setter. Are you building? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. What? You know, I'm still going to be here on the old day. No, we don't care. Oh, wow. Listen to what's his name? Hmm. Oh, yeah. What's his name any after? What was his name anyway, Bill? Yeah, right. Can can mostly still do some stuff for me from time to time? Absolutely. No, no problem. No price difference. Oh, I see. Oh, okay. We'll talk for you. Yeah. Okay. You send the tapes over and I have to put on the cart label, not for use on FM. That's what you thought. That's what you thought. So you're going to start money morning and you know? Money morning, six to ten. You understand those hours now, Bill. Do I have to explain anything? Yeah. I'm going to have to roll a tape so I can hear you. Okay. Sounds good to me. I can bring you up on the tune in the control with the simultaneous. Or yeah, exactly. Just throw some of it on here. We don't care. Okay. Good luck. Good luck to you. Thanks a lot. I think like that. Celebrity caller Bill Tanner, We heard from a Don Roger Bill Tanner, How 105 McCay and, you know, Don't say a Jim Scholar. Yeah. Did I do good? That's a boy. Did I do well? And that's it? I done good. And we heard no one else. Dinner from the morning walk. No. No, no. I don't think you're going to hear. Well, I mean, they got such a number. Why would I like disappearing from the dial? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Literally. And why would I suggest, for whatever reason, I just appeared, look at that. A three, three. Boy, for them. That is a wicked number. And old sunny boys, dropping ever so steadily. Sort of like a rock. Yeah. They're not floating anymore. They're not floating anymore. They're thinking, honey. That's what all those bananas they'll do to you. I mean, even Chiquito wants out of the house. I mean, even Chiquito wants out of the house. For a lot of nail. Hello. I know. Are you doing good? Good. Thank you. Okay, listen. I just wanted to say I was out fishing on a fishing. Well, not cheap subject on your moon. Everything that's great. The drag point. The idea of it is that there's a pose at least. They work over it. They're looking for compressions. Yep. They said he gets there. It's coming on to you. We can't get up there. Yeah. Yeah. Here we go again. Well, tell them to get their ice up in the morning. Okay. Well, that's what I would try to tell you. You're out there just like you say. They're do-spugs. Let me tell you something. After a day or two of that nonsense, they'll be, they'll need a fix. They'll get up early in the morning. They'll turn it on and get into the habit of it. Like all the rest of it. You know, I had a argument with them about that. You know, they're saying, oh, he's telling me he's raining just to get out of here. I didn't what happened the worst thing was I won the pool on this drift fishing boat. And I won the big- I got the biggest fish. You got the bigger one. You'd be happy now, you know. So Neil, if you could just give them a word, say something to them. Okay, let me give them a little something that'll really get even, okay. I'll faint worse than death. The kiss of death. Okay, did that do it, sir? That'll do it. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Well, listen, we're almost out of time, right? Oh, Neil, we don't have to come on, Neil. We don't have a fan on our radio. I know. What time is it? What time is it? Now, everybody's going to get up and leave the studio and leave me all along, right? Well, I have to go and take care of some contractual obligations. Well, you're going to drop it. And then I have to tape a little show with our feathered friend here who is a buying another easy show for that in sippin' crap that they haven't do in a week in unzita. And I have a lot of ways to go out of production and be willing to go out. But you can pass. You can pass in the glory of your four one. You share. I bet you're not lost. Yeah, no, you're not. You got to have a doubt in the two o'clock hour. You had probably a six or a five something, beat the crap out of that stupid daffy. Yeah. And then you never hear from that guy again. That maniac, the car, your call. Oh, you think so? He does. Good. And it's all kind of a pay off. He just tell him to pay off. Tell him you want his hundred grand this afternoon on 20s and 50s only. Okay? Seriously. And then I can punch. I don't want to take it apart. I don't want to overdo it on at the IOD on those numbers. Boy, you know, I mean, see one book by itself. I agree is could be a fluke, but you know what it's a succession when it's like a disaster story, you know what I'm saying? Right. He twinked the Titanic. He's going to go over. And then dropping to the bottom, you know, and they never float. We know. We know that. Since you're not giving me a lead in anymore, it's all over for me. Yes. It's going to go from a two to one to our whatever's got from a two six to a two nine. Yeah. Well, yeah, but he forgot about something. He's lead it. Okay. My quilt is here with the headlines and then the stand will be along to brag for four hours. And tomorrow is Pheneon AM. So whatever you do, call everybody in a phone directory starting with five A.S. Court service and make sure they're tuned in. You've been listening to the new Roger show.
