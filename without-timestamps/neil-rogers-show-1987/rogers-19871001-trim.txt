Now, Bobby, who is, you know, a good guy, but sounds a little little wild out. So to speak, yeah. And who knows what's in that? Of course, all I'd cramp about saying elsewhere, which is enough to put anybody into a coma. Get serious. I mean, who wants to see Ronnie Cox moaning? Now, he wasn't Ronnie. He was an actual Apple's way. So if it years ago, I remember that show. And Vince van Patton was in that show. Now, Vince, and Van Patton were moaning that I would turn it off. I paid the fact you back. Heavy money. serious money. Don't hold your breath. Yes. Nice to meet you, please. You've got him. You're on your own. You're on. I think you're on. You're on and I'm on. Okay. My ear is not so that's why I don't know. So are you going to play the candy baker that's it today? Or we got to call it? Yes. You would say a lot of money for a lot of people calling in and they would make any money. All right. Let's do it every day. We can make it a regular feature on the show. It's a big community service now. I have one more service. If you get a 900 number and have the secrets to my success and you can make it through money too. The secrets to my success? Yes. Because you have a, what's it really? Have a great voice. What success? How about the secrets to my failure? That would be no no serious break. I mean, you are above. I'm genius.

Hey, listen, I love call. But boy, it's just been a long hot summer for me. Great news. Conversations. We're trying to answer all those questions. Yeah. And given them a talk a little bit today about my journey's lighter. And how he had written a letter to Gary Fawler and tried to get Gary Fawler and to a plan. He's very told that to work with him on a plan to put people away from you. A plan that would include some of the partners and come organized. What did you say pop men? It's a little bit under the turning Roy. Gruppin. Leave me. Just in the period. And they said that John ankleberg. I think there's something a lot of people have realized is that John ankleberg was also working with Jimmy Swagger long before Gary Fawler even came to our home. Yes. You're going to put a piece down in the middle. Right. I'm going to go and go. Yeah. I'm doing something that people don't realize. That's a John ankleberg have a game. Do we need to put John ankleberg on my network? Because I'm kind of the people on the air. Well because they've received a many complaints that they were attacking. Find the industries and people. And we felt that we were attacking people. Right. And so that's what John ankleberg. Oh, I think it's a truth for John. Many of the players in all of this have a reason behind it. And it was also about that other day. If you have not heard this entire message, please hold on. It will repeat. Go down and stand. If the jam were to graduate call with today. You're spending the chance to stop this. There's a people that are there. And the answer is something you're touched on. Yeah. Be cool. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. I'm going to go. Finally, the 10 records that you've been working for. Can we face unbelievable new album? Here's the rock. I called out from under. The pain turns out made up out. Then the husband of the piece hits the touchdown. Oh, beautiful. It's cold. And go while we're about to melt down the pain. It's all here. The headache. The headache. The pain gays. My face. My message. I'm going to be right. Tell me, please. Here's the rock. But I called out from under. Thank you, Batman. If you tell your burning eye out, you're feeling well. Thank you. God bless you. You do notice in these recordings. There's no religion at all anymore. They have not even played that game anymore. Pretending. But it's worse than a soap opera. Hmm. Forced and Saint elsewhere. I mean, they're just a vicious. Yeah. We took him off the network because he was attacking other people. And what are they doing? Another attack. And then the board tacky them. So life kind of evens out. It's 11 30. Good. Oh, yeah. Well, we're going for you. We'll work on it. That guy still hasn't been able to well. Very well. I guess. That's for it. They county. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. You have to pay attention to them. A very important man. Yeah. You sound like it. I'm Dr. O. The Secret from the South Florida Association of Scientific Research. And I was caring about some of the types of earthquakes here in Miami. And it's very true. In fact, most of the people here are even. Artists and beer plummeters. They feel rambling in their stomach because of it. And it's crazy. I tell you that it's caused by my research and Xavier Fajra. A couple of other new compulsive. Well, going a male race with a plenty of health stress and guns in their way. And they'd be couldn't happen to you. You know what? Show this guy's auditioning for it. I recognize that material. That's not it. Fire. Fire. Fire. Don't buy a house. Who laid out? Who laid out? I know what I love. It's a way comes out every day. It talks about how some of our materials really great and some of its sucks. You know that's great. I love that. That's at least he's a little bit on it. A little. We tried to warn him about this. Not part of his reputation that precedes him. But you know, it's never too late to make your nose shrink. Oh, this is. This is going to be. Play off. Okay, well obviously, you know, don't even try to call Jeff Strikker is the bottom line. Which is going to create some very serious problems for some of the people in South Florida, right? Okay. Well, listen, a few hours will pass. Just control yourselves. Okay. Let's go back to the phone. We got some day lines. Not flashing at the moment. 624 9400. Broward. Hello. Hi, Neil. I'm doing. Okay. I got a question. I want to ask you. You know, breaking it to maybe throw the police officers. It may be listening. Shoot. On in the air, can this state go against federal law or after the state law, if you see a federal law, they carry a weapon into a bar, a liquor, a stab. You can't carry it into a bar. It's against, that's one of the places you can't do it. I'm listening to TV right here. No, you can't take it into a bar. If one of the things you try to figure out is if you go into a restaurant that's got a bar, can you take a gun in there? That's, you have to be tested. The whole thing is crazy. Don't you understand? You're trying to make a logical situation out of insanity. I moved out of 18 Mexico. Yeah. In this 18 Mexico state, just taking 100 nays a great way. Well, that's the Governor more taxes and the legislature. I got a bunch of goofballs running this state. How long have I been saying that? I mean, I've been knocking myself out for 12 years to try to make these people understand it. And they don't care. I don't care. So we're all, you know, wrapped up in this because the people don't give it to them. I've been listening to you for 18 months. It's like I came down here. And then, like, the kick. You got it. Well, hey, listen, you ain't seen nothing yet. As Reagan would say, there's probably more to come. I can believe that. But it's already. Okay. All right, I have a good one. Good luck to you. I mean, does it pay to get upset about all this? We've done it. We've had strokes, nervous breakdowns. It doesn't do any good. You're living in a new end or false state with a bunch of total goofballs. And that's what it is. You know, that's the price you pay for sunshine. And, of course, the last few days, we've seen all this great sunshine. It's terrific. Well, the WINZ, a caller in date county who I'm sure is desperate. Desperate to speak to us, hello. I told you, was I right or what? They'd county, hello. Oh, boy. They're out there now. Aren't they? I think the earthquake of the San Andreas fall to just spread. They'd, hello. Hi. Hi. Me, yes. Why are you? Great. Listen, are you were talking about that Rob? Well, movie. How did you like it? I thought it was great. And the her, you know, when talking right, yes, you're going to come on my spine. And you know what really got, I'm glad you brought that up. You know what really made me sick about that movie was Jim Bolushi in a character that he played. In fact, both of the, that other couple, the morons, the best friends of Roblo and his girlfriend there. Right. I know people like that. And their, that movie was the best proof of that motto that you hear me say all the time. It's not important in life to choose succeed, but that your friends fail. Exactly. And they were doing their damn this to split them up and screw them up and a Jim Bolushi. I know people like that. I know. Just obnoxious, weird, puzzling, disgusting, scumbag moron. I know. I didn't like him until it was movie, but I thought he did, you know, he did very well. Oh, he was, he needed to be sure. He needed to come to Miami and be shot. Well, nice talking to you. And I listen to you for a long time, but I haven't had the curry to call you. Okay. Well, you have good taste. I'm glad you enjoyed the movie. Okay. Thanks. Speaking of which this Saturday on HBO, I'm not going to play the music because then he'll come running back in, get all excited. Stand by me. In fact, that's going to be your homework assignment over the weekend Saturday night. I don't know what time it is. We'll find out, but on HBO, his stand by me. It's also this month there be on, I think, like the movie channel or show time or cinema. It's just all over the place. So those of you who've been hearing somebody, we all know, rave and ranting and carry on about how great this movie is. This would be our opportunity. And on Monday, we can all sit around and rip it. Brown, brown, hello. Let me say it again. Uh, hello. Yes, yes, Neil. Yes. Hi. How you doing? Okay. Turn that radio off, sir. It's off. Okay. I'm first time calling. I think everybody's making a lot of noise over the television. Let's see how it went out. And I'm sure. And listen, to make sure all of a sense in the world, I have people walking through the mob of the holster. Let's go back. In fact, maybe we can go back to a segregation again. You know, we can go back pre civil war. Maybe we can have a slay off, or later on in the show today. I don't think people will slay auction on the air. I think the biggest bomb. Wouldn't bring Larry Kennedy to it. I'll trade line, you know, get the phones really hot. One of the bigger problems I think is our home. I've got two slaves in a pop-up coaster. What's answer? I'm sorry. I'm getting emotional. I think one of our bigger problems rather than, you know, the arm citizen, but I'm sure it's going to work out. Well, what do you mean you're sure it's going to work out? What makes you say such a thing like Americans are really responsible with gun? I've come full circle. I do. I'm very nervous about the government making too many laws dealing with guns. Because I don't trust the government. I don't trust the police, especially in this town. And I don't believe that they're going to protect this. But on the other hand, the idea that you can just walk around like why it or for the holster and a gun, and just about anywhere you go. I mean, that's really getting a little carried away. You don't think so? Yes, I do. Oh, I guess for private ownership of guns. I can't see people carrying it. Well, that's what we're talking about. That's not what the law. That's not where it stops. A lot of people are going to be doing that though. I just think the gun law is a little bit. But what we should all think about, look at what happened down at the airport with the Metro dates off down there. The police and software are very, very aggressive overreacting type people. That's because there's a great many of our criminals to begin with. So what do you want? But has there ever been anybody ever taken on these? Good stop boat that they call themselves police officers. They're not police officers. They don't have the public interest in money. They are. What do you know which ones are which? They can't do it. Yeah. So the answer obviously the solvents. Instead of to try to clean it up a little. See, that's the one thing about this state. Like auto inspection. It wasn't working because we didn't have enough hours and we didn't have enough stations. So we just threw it out altogether. And that's the same thing we're doing with the gun law. You know, we just throw things out. And instead of cleaning up the police force and instead of finally getting a, you know, a state attorney and date county and get some convictions. Instead of sitting there on TV with a stupid look on her face. You know, the people here love it. They love Janet Reno. I don't know what they're thinking of. The state is in dire state. Yeah. What do you mean? The only people we can convict here are people who work in video stores who sell Debbie does Ojas. You know, those people we can convict. And that rolling that came down yesterday. You know, just unbelievable. Just incredible. That, you know, you might go into his now they're even threatening to arrest the customers. If you go into your neighborhood, the Joe's video store. And you rent, you know, Mary Poppins in the front. And then you go in a back and you rent the Sonya sunrise. If that's not on the approved list, which they're not going to tell them which ones are approved. It's just like the FCC, you know, they don't want to tell you what the rules are. And they're out there hovering waiting to nail you for something that you can't identify. Same thing. What is the cause of what is it? It's a court. If one word, there are fascism. That's the cause of it fascism. You've got a fascist governor and a fascist president and a fascist Supreme court that's on the verge of getting a lot worse. That's, that's what's going on in America today. And meanwhile, everybody's sitting back and are doing entertainment tonight. That's, that's the nature of the game in America. That's what, that's what you're living in. It's what I've never, never learned. The young people don't, the old people don't. Hey, listen to old people. Both old people get a card from any acrimon and they all march like a bunch of sheep. And they go in a vote the same morons in over and over and over and over again. I saw that tape of what went on in Palahashi last night about this stupid tax. And I watched Ron Silver and all these other idiots up there. pathetic, just pathetic what they're doing. You know, and I've heard almost 12 years. I busted my guts out on a year thinking that I was going to try to motivate somebody to do something. Forget it. That's not the nature of the state. These are all a scape as you've got here. They all came to Florida to escape from reality. And if created their own new reality, it's called a nightmare, a living nightmare. So what if a real people do they just lay down? No, the real people live up north. That's all I can tell you. Well, I'm getting excited again. Why, why did I do that after all these months? You know, he's getting me all worked up to a frenzy. And there's no point. I mean, you know, you live with it because you know where you are. No, Neil, palm. No. No, the, the, the, the, the, the Italian day though, right? Right, right, Italian from plantation. Right. No, right. Little break. So we're like a grand hour. So many people will crop up on there. Well, listen, I got to go eat lunch. And they know we can't call the West Coast. So they're not interested in the show anymore. So they're a little bit more difficult. Pickle crowd got a nice hate letter from my Harold Diamond and Tamarack. Really. Yeah. The ship is sinking. He said, we're not discussing all those wonderful heavy issues. I guess Harold isn't paying too much attention last year, right? Or last nine months. He's another one of those guys who wants to hear me have a stroke on the area. That's what it's all about. Good luck to you, Harold. We love Pam, Iraq. It's just one step away in my heart from Halandale. One step. Boy, and then we got, that can't be a local number. Can't it two, five, eight, bird? Looks like, I know. No, no. I don't know. Why don't I dial that up, huh? By a colleague's square. Where the hell is that? It sounds like Boston, to me. I really, that's the only colleague's square. I don't know the area. It's only a colleague's square. You know up. There are my no-of-harvard square. Yeah. And I know of all kinds of other squares, but I know I never heard of colleague square. That's just my guess. I have no idea. Scally square. All right, I'll try it. We got to move. The R D R D. Okay. Probably wind up on WRKO or something. It would be down Boston. Yeah, 617. Okay. Well, maybe whoever sent this into is can call and tell us if it's not boss. It was a bird lover. There's no question about that. I don't think it's quite a minute. It's ringing. It's ringing. It's scary. Uh-oh. Oh boy. Hello. Cally square. A V a hervey. Okay. I guess they're out of the cage for this. All right. Okay. Anyway, it's 10 past noon. We got a couple of hours to go. And then we also got that wonderful card from somebody in West Palm Beach. And that's scraggly writing. You can always tell about that real, scraggly looks like somebody 100 years old. They're all upset about my belly aching about working on Saturday. About, you know, even people are working hospitals work six days. And it said, you know, some diabetic moron who eats ice cream, winds up in the hospital. They have to be there just in case. Nice card from West Palm Beach for those people in Palm Beach County. You know, what a bunch of douche bags they are, you know? Let's do an all out attack on Palm Beach County. That is the most mong place I worked there for a year. And I want to tell you something. There are, you know, there's some nice people up there. Yeah, but they're getting what they deserve. 10 or 20. They got Mike Miller. Yeah. They got Daphim Macallum. Yeah. We're taking care of Palm Beach. Yeah. And we even stuck them with John Broward for a little while too. Really Brian, you know, try and we're going to give what they deserve. Okay. Well, listen, you're listening to the Vio Roger show on all full radio. That's an idea. All full radio. Hmm. Can have all the host come in a different different kinds of food on here and describe it. All different restaurants could come in and cater it all day. It's been that way this week anyway. Mr. Food. Okay. You know, we got all the lines flashing now and I have a feeling that this is a fresh bunch. You know, yeah. Well, hold it but watch. You keep hitting that same one. No, I don't. What's up to you? Well, no, you've hit it a lot. But, you know, whatever. Dave County loves. No, no, no, no. Okay. Good, good time. Great. If anybody who didn't go Monday night really missed out. Long day night, you bet. Good time. Listen, where if you heard that this morning? No, I only heard, I only heard Neil Roger's theater at about eight. The movie came up that you were talking about with Rob. What's on his head? I'm afraid to ask. Yeah. Turn off the sound and just watch Rob. Oh, it's a good time for the great taste. Donald, shame on you. Sounds like Donald. Did he really say that? I said to the that of that. Yeah. I just, I'd love you to see Donald come on your show. I really would. No thanks. Or he would come in and happen though. He'd be on here once and he'd never show his face in public again after that. What the party? You see, first of all, let me say this to you. Rob low is a nice looking kidnol. Although lately he's getting that done Johnson's cousin. He looks like he doesn't shave good or something. But he's a good looking kid. But the movie was a good movie. I mean, it was something you could really get into. You know, it wasn't one of the all-time great moments. But it was a good movie. It's okay. He looks good. The feel is quite the same part. There's something about her though. I mean, she's nice looking, but she's like, Oh, crap.
