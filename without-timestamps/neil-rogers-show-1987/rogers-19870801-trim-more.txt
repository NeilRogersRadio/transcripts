Boy, even though it's like, he's a drugger out. Right. Even he made it on there. It's great. Well, I can't imagine that he's a great American. He was a great American and what can I say? Well, those were little bonus numbers for you today. The reason gentleman, you all get those anywhere else you have found. The world is a better fast. And probably not to left you a tissue bone. I'm going to show you. Boy, those are good. Those are some of my favorites. You did have a lot of important things. Yeah, I told you that. Did you then believe me? I just come in. I roll in here Saturday expecting for you to be her like a clutch. We don't expect you to be her on Saturday. I was wrong. I want to say making fun of you that you really had nothing to do with the center. I was wrong. We have a lot to do. I still have. Yeah, I don't care. You know, this business about what like nature takes care of it and you're not attracted. That's a lot of garbage. I mean, if you're a virul heterosexual male, which is something I don't know much about. If you were and you had an attractive viewer like 17 and you had a beautiful 16 year old sister, it was big breasts and hard nipples and whatever else it is that they get all excited about. I'm sorry, but you probably would like peaked in the room. No, no. Pious is no. You wouldn't be in the least bit interested because it's just like nature. You know, protects you. There's a psychological barrier. From the time you're born, you know that this is a no no. I don't know. However, if you have a 17 year old brother, let's turn. Wait, is there a message? There's a message coming on the screen. When you grow up with somebody, you are so bored. Yeah, you know, with them. Yeah, you don't like them. That is a good point. You know. Yeah. If you're not to tell them down to Blue Lagoon, of course they were there alone. Different. That's different and imperative. They forgot to tell your girlfriend that. That's really a must give. Yeah, that's exactly right. That's different. That's a different situation. That's why everyone love those movies so much. And they know that's not why everyone loves them. They're so much. They want to scan in those movies. Who have that? That's the only reason anybody could have loved the movies because they were both pathetic. They were done. Blue Lagoon. They do have six copies of Blue Lagoon. They're living it, but like the borough. That was a giant, unbelievable smash at the box. Of course, because everybody wanted to see book shields and Chris Sackens naked, which we did get to see him naked in the water. Yeah. And Blue Lagoon. He made blue and the box look like giant. Uh-huh. That's right. That's right. That's very good about that. And it's the same thing with paradise. Which is also a giant. It might be all the speaking of giant all the scabbing about James Dean. Okay. James Dean A was ugly. Okay. Trust me. He was ugly. And B, he smelled bad. I mean, everything you read about him, the guy never got, he was, he was kind of like a early day, Rick Weaver. You know what I mean? He never got near a bar at coast. You never saw Irish springer. And he smelled terrible. His hygiene was horrendous. He was a scuzz. And he was also, he was in do like S&M. And he would burn cigarette holes and his, but I don't really get into any of that. I don't understand people want to have somebody put out their cigarette on your chest. You know, I don't know what that's all about. Especially women, but speaking of S&M. The whole thing is a myth. What about S&M? I heard at another one of those weird radio rumors yesterday. Really? About one of our, you know, you saved it for this lady into the show. When you mentioned S&M it popped into my life. And I can't believe, I don't even know if I should get into this at all. I'm sure you'll force your video. We always do like the story about Mike Miller being a maiter day at stake in shake. In St. Pete. Will you work with this guy? So I wondered if you could shed any light on this. I heard Jerry Witchner of all people. Is a little kinky. Are you work with this man, didn't you? I heard, I just before you continue the story has a very big 357 magnum. I know. That's why I did not want you to be with this guy at all. Everyone. I heard he. Dally's with. Oh, don't say it. Not a my show. Say it on somebody else's show. If you want to do slander, do it on somebody else's show. Exactly. That's why I'm going to stop right now. But I just wanted to do. Dally's with. Don't say it. I'm not. Write it up. Write it on that paper. Just what we were talking about. Oh, I see. Yeah. Well, who cares? Why just wanted to see it heard that? Because you worked with me. We even rolled over. Won't roll over for him. I mean, you know. I think we're gone further than we should have with that already. And we were not interested in people's private life. Good. OK. We don't want to stick our nose just like his private life. Such a bizarre rumor. Yeah. If it would have been Jason Gidrick's private life, then we want to pull still on right or headlong. Exactly. We might have talked about it in a great way. We'd better just back. I'll break it. We don't know. I think we just back out of that whole situation. I'm very sorry. I brought it up. I've been. I apologize to the audience. What do you want to know? You ought to apologize to Jerry. I do. His wig might change to purple if you. Although it already is purple. So I'd rather. Broward. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Let me ask you some. Why is Dan going to these desperate topics like hot pursuit and things like that? I mean, yeah. He's going to be shooting for about a one, two rating. That was a good show. Oh, come on. No one cares. Why didn't listen to him? But it was a good show. Well, no one did except the bunch of wine cops, you know. Yeah. What are cops in the pigs? I couldn't believe he was so nice. No, he did. He was a little hostile with a couple of the cops. No one will lose pigs. Well, I don't dislike all police, but most of them are pigs. Oh, yeah. And ego chips. Yeah. Yeah. Pigs. I think he's just playing up to you. He came. You said he was real conservative. I think he's doing his cop-bashing. He's a coach just to play up to you. And it just doesn't work, you know? You think so? Yeah. Waste the time. Well, I'm making him important. You can do another John Broward type show. Exactly. Yeah. But he can talk about Nickarragua. Just up on insist and mutual masturbation. Yeah. That would be more exciting. Now do you have any sisters? No. Brothers. Yeah. Two. Two brothers who are older. Younger. Younger. How much younger? Three years. And two. And you're old? 34. 34. But you've got a good memory. Oh. Huh? Thank you. No, I mean, giving a compliment up a thought. Now when you were younger, you and your brothers certainly never did anything. No. No experimenting. No, it all. You and your cousins. Well, cousins, perhaps. Really? Oh, yeah. Little red-headed cousin named Kathy. Uh-huh. Unbelievable. She was hot. Oh. Was she hot? Oh. How hot was she? 14 years. What? She was 14? Yeah. No, he said this went on for 14 years. I don't know. She was 25. Six to the time she was 20. She was hot from day one. Are you serious? Oh. And believe me. Well, without getting too graphic, because it's a family show. And the SEC is monitoring. Oh, yeah. Huh? Oh, I have to say it's ready here. Well, I don't like red here. In fact, red here. I hate to say this because I don't like people with red here. But in terms of being attractive to me, red here is an incredible turnoff. I mean, I just, I get physically ill when I think about it. But you know, to each zone. Oh, my, you know, it's a little bit. Oh, that's a good. You know, you're in your cousin. She was 14. You're how old? I 16, 16. And what is it that you were doing without getting, you know, used some special terms. Use a little discreetly. I guess you call it familiar your copulation. Oh, my God. Wow. She was a first cousin too. A first cousin. And you do understand that. The Mongol, and the. Yeah. So, you know, I think you're in a hard one. In fact, the whole city of Nashville is a result of that kind of relationships. Yeah, but he was a Mongol, I don't think there's a problem. Oh, I see. So, you know, in the next generation. Yeah. No, seriously. In other words, she was really hot. Yeah. And so were you. Uh-huh. And how long did this go on? Oh, 15, 20 minutes. No, no. I don't know. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. 15 or 20 minutes. What a romance. No. No. No. No. How long? One month. We. Taking two. I mean, yeah. Oh, I see. It was like one time. Yeah. One. Just one time. But you still remember it. Yeah. He remembers it vividly. Was she the best you ever had? Did that point? To that point. Yeah. She was. Till his brother came along. Uh-huh. But it was a certain, you know, the insist angle. Really, uh, as little excited. Oh, sure. I'm eating it's exciting. It's 16. Oh, yeah. You know. So once again, we have found Stan a show. He got set now. No, I'm, you're right. It was an operation. This is a great topic. It really is. Unfortunately, most people are unlike you. And I commend you on your honesty, but most people are just, I don't know whether it's social stigma or what it is. But they just are too embarrassed to admit those things. Yeah. Yeah. If I, it's just right, certainly. And track the tour. But I don't think I'd actually follow through an act. It's a little bit. All right. Now, let's say you were 16 and this 14 year old cousin, instead of being your cousin of in your sister, okay? Yeah. Wait a minute. And your parents would have taken you on a trip to Calamazoo where somewhere. And you would have all, you've been in a motel on your mother and father where and run room. Uh-huh. And the two of you were in another room for your sleeping arrangements. Now is there a possibility that something might have happened? Yeah. Most likely in a wretched, but I don't know if anything else would happen. Well, that's good. That's good. How are you? Yeah. You like you say, I don't think there's anything. If you make your sister, you didn't know, like, two adopted people in two parts of the country and they made each other. I don't think there'd be any kind of a barrier between them, you know, genetic barrier or a like goes up, you're not supposed to be attracted to them. But when you grow up with somebody, it's different. They're all those signals there for bitten fruit. Yeah. But it was. In fact, if you have any female relatives, you like give it a shot. You know, I did have a cousin, as a matter of fact, a female cousin. And we did do some interesting things. Oh, okay. I also had a male cousin and we did some very interesting things. I'll say you're not a real-enctrinated sexual sentence. Huh? You know, I have a problem. When I first started listening to you, if months ago, I didn't realize that you were at home a sexual and of course. Why do you're most jealous? I don't know. But can some of you go. Yeah. And once I found out, I didn't care. Yeah. I told them people about it. And once I describe you from, you know, New York Jewish homosexual. They went and listened. Then I said, not telling them. They're listening, loving. Yeah. But now I'm running into a problem. In the last week or so with your topic is the Hawaii. But, you know, when I tell people, I have to have it this claimer. You know, like, I was really okay. He's really funny. But don't get shook up. When he starts to troll, when he's trolls on the ear, don't get up. So what do you don't think that I'm really doing that seriously? I mean, of course, there was always though, hopefully in the back of my mind that maybe a miracle, you know, might happen. I mean, a real, yeah, I mean, I yesterday. That was ridiculous. Yeah. Well, you know, somebody, somebody he'll be 20. That's true. Did he have written here? No. Trust me. No way. All right, no. Okay. Take care. And say hi to your cousin. I will. Okay. Boy, that's incredible. Yeah. Good call. In fact, I'm going to, I really go to a, would mitt something on the ear now that I've been, you know, always pushing you to be more honest and more open. And I'm going to admit that I had sex with the 12 year old boy, but how old were you? 12. Okay. In fact, I had sex with a couple of 12 year old boy. What I say had sex, I mean, it was just, you know, back when you were five minutes. Yeah. It was four minutes. Yeah. Like in a basket ball game, you know, a little dribble when it's about it. Okay. It's 13 before two at WI and Z. Well, I said, that took some great courage to admit that on the ear when we come back, Len is going to make some startling admissions to the audience. Today is the day. Okay. Two, two, two, much important business to, two, two, two. Oh, we could play just a little bit of shoe bar. Sure. Like the copa. Now, listen, I shouldn't say the copa because there's a copa on bird road. Yes. In South Miami. And we know what they got. They got not upset with me, but they were nervous a few years ago. It's about four years ago. I'm not a radio station. Does I had made some cracks about the copa and the clientele. And I was talking about the copa and the four-laterdale of course, off federal highway by the airport. Well, that's right. Yeah. The copa on bird road you're talking about is. And he called and he begged me to go on and say, hey, the copa on bird road is not. Is that still the copa? I can't remember. I don't know. It may be something else now. No, it's probably El Copa. Okay. Date County. Hello. Yeah. Time. Who's this? Let me check. I think it's Neil. Hey, I knew I'd do it. This is Gary from Dolphin. Yes. Hi, you're doing, Gary. You got the scents of cards for me. Oh, okay. Thank you so much. Okay. And they're also, we just discovered some hurricane cards in there, too. Yeah. We can't see you gave you some hurricane cards. We gave you some Dolphin. Well, we appreciate them. We didn't like the pictures on the Dolphin schedule. But nothing is perfect. You know, I like tank sp pictures, but the other one. Yeah, well, we get a little bit of everything. We need to clean up his act. Well, what can you do? I know. Well, I'll stop by next week. Great. Thanks, Gary. Good. Good guy. Gary from Dolphin Digest, who reprinted our so far ad. That's right. And we appreciate that. Oh, listen to that. Broward. Hello. Hello there. Boy, my glad you're there after that big buildup. Oh, wow. Well, I'm a, I am a garden view from the tin pan. Cretaceone on the wind jet blimp. Oh, it sounds like it, too. Hey, how you doing, Clarence? I'm looking at foam. Uh-huh. Okay. How's that? That's even better. All right. This is John who was there yesterday. Oh, John. Oh, John, who was here yesterday? Yeah, not Michelle John. Okay. Yeah, this is the big one. Great. Um, we had a water cooler installed in our office the other day. We could have a place to stand around the talk. Drive for every day, uh, you know, uh, I don't have to relate to this. And we got a little wiki, picky dog. And we put them up on top of the water cooler. And only does is he stands there with his sailor head on. It says, talk to me. Talk to me here. Yeah, we have one. You wind it up and it does talk up. It's incredible. I do talk back. I get, uh, your commercial time down perfect. And I come back and just to be, uh, Yeah, wind, uh, music is coming on. Oh, look at that. We just got a message. The copa is closed. This is the one in bird road. Yeah. It's a funeral home or something now. Oh. So I really did something for their image. Yeah. I do that. Sorry. Mario's. We, we have a recording here also. Uh, the, uh, Jerbow that actually power the wind jet whip. 20 minutes. Go ahead. That was that. That was good. Wait a minute. I got an article in here. Hold it. Okay. You made it. I think I made it. Okay. I guess the Jerbow's ran out of steam. Oh, boy. I got an article here in a magazine. I'll take about two minutes to read. It's, uh, Well, good luck to you, John. The chances of that on the scale of zero. Oh, but it's about condoms and rock groups. Minus infinity. You don't want to hear condoms and rock groups. No, would you send me the article. You can bring it in Monday. Okay. I'll do that. All right. Well, did you make a doorkus today, John? Yeah. Well, we paid it yesterday. All that's right. Of course. So I know what I had the last thing. Um, I've got a song here. And the title of the song is The Nips are Getting Bigger. Oh, boy.
