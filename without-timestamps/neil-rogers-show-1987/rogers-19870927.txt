We were in a resort and they started dancing and you won't believe it's the only country in the world where black people don't have rid of. And this kid starts break dancing and he spent the entire night teaching the natives how to break dance. It was a sight not to be believed. It was just funny. We have a new, you know, that potato head thing that they did to take off the Michael Jackson head. Sure. We have a Michel Gillin head doll. I will be selling next to you. You know, I have a client who invented Mr. Potato Head. My client invented it. The original Mr. Potato Head was his. What's his name, Brian Norkross? Oh, his name is George Lerner. The man is in his early 70s. What a nice guy. He brought me a family of the Mr. Potato Head to have the involved. He's a husband, a wife, and a child. They have all the other things. Yeah, like the Michael Jackson head. He's a dog and has broke. And made a nice bit of change on it, which was very nice. Yeah. But it's... The guy has a thing as he bowled over the lady. I don't know when he invented it. He was 35 years ago, 40 years ago. He thought, whatever, yeah. Whatever you say. Well, I don't know. Well, whatever. But it has evolved. It's just incredible. I can't believe when the roads get wet in this town, what happens to the drivers. They're dead. They are dead, people. Have you ever seen them? Yeah. Every day. I would like to take one of those pellet guns and shoot them. What does that got to do with the potato head? Nothing. He just...the Segwaying from one to another. Don't you just cut it? Isn't that okay? Sure. No problem. No problem. Don't let Paul step on your toes, sir. You're not. You're not. You're not. For a special and trouble maker, for a lie.
