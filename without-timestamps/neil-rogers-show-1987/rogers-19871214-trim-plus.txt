But I ain't good luck to you. You have a very good vacation and don't let birds kill you, show. Thank you sir. I'll read the truth. Okay. Don't let birds kill you, show. Thank you sir. I'll read the truth. Okay, the masked Marauder from Kendall. Hello. Good morning. Oh wait a minute, before we talk to the masked Marauder, you're never going to believe this is a true story. I think I have the same one. No, you don't. I could. Is it about to tease okay? No. Okay. I just want to bet him. Will you just control yourself for a moment, please? Was that the one about the restaurant? Yes. Oh, that's a great story. Hold on a minute. I was in Windix, my favorite Windix, a yesterday. Really? Just to get a few items and I'm, well, I had to get some bananas. Okay. And why do you look at me? But he didn't do it those bananas. Anyway, I had to get some fruit. No, that's not any better. Anyway, I had to get a couple items and I walk into the produce section. You'll never guess who was there in a million years. What couple was there? Fima Calam and John Broward. And worse, not the callers. No worse. Oh, God. The least Maler and Al. Jamie and Marcie. Jamie and Marcie. I've Windix. I don't think they live in a little plant. They live in Hellendale. So everybody now is flocking to my Windix. I can't believe it. Okay. I'm sorry. What were you that was worth waiting for? By the way, were those numbers? Well, there is that. I don't know why they say they're too new. Yeah. What do you mean they're in there? Well, we don't get there in there, but they, I don't know why you can't get until new. Do you have any predictions? Well, wait a minute. Let's put it this way. I don't want to get your hopes up too high. No. But I noticed that both of you are kind of like common. I'm mentioning about that today because it's a big day for everybody. Isn't it? It is. Oh, yeah. There are a lot of, well, it's not that big for us because they're not expecting all that much yet. I want you to be expecting. I'll tell you how you're lower. Oh, I can get somewhere in the twos. Oh, well, hopefully it would be. Yeah, I think I don't think. I think it would be. What do you mean hopefully it would be in the twos. We had a one nine last time and we inherited that august that was dreads. God of be above a two. Yeah, it, it, it, it, it surprised us as far as what I see as at least doubles. It's at least doubled. Oh, that'd be great. The whole thing is last time I thought about that last month and like, there was something totally different. I think it would be a lot of different things. I think it would be a lot of different things. If you give me the instructions, let's have some instructions over there. I can't go back to the computer and give you the instructions. Mark, you don't have an reverse breakdown. Well, because I just don't know how to use this thing to it's full of potential. Well, listen, you've got a lot of things you don't know how to use that. They're full of potential, you know. And hopefully you'll be the one to tell. You can, you can bet your life I won't trust me. Okay, now, I have some material for you today. Oh, I hear that one of the board ops from W snooze. All right. Except for our girlfriend, David. Okay. Okay, now I have some material for you. I'm going to tell you about the one about Steve Kane. Yes. The rest time. Did you already tell that? No, I didn't have a told that yet. Okay. Are you going to tell it or just threaten the tell? I'm not sure what the name of the restaurant was. But our good friend, Steve Kane, went to a restaurant and he ran up 130 dollar bills. That's the same amount you had. And he, at the end, he wanted, you know, obviously the leech went off. They told the awaitress. I'm Steve Kane, you know, the guy that talks about right restaurant on. That was what you said about that. And she said so. So then he said, you know, call over your manager. He told the same thing to the manager. She said so. And then he left 10, 130 dollar bills. If the waitress. Yeah, he was very upset that he had a pay. In other words, the point is he was looking for a freebie. And he didn't get it. So then he left no tip on 130 dollar check. How do you go like that? What a guy. Yeah. All heard. Now, I have a treat to you today. Just don't know where to begin. Okay. I, I, I, this is a joke. I was at someplace and I called up 800 information. And I can know how you, when you call it, these people have to tell me on the air. Yep. And I told him I was jacked from Miami Beach on Zeta. So he wanted to know why our 800 number wasn't missed. Anyways, that could be real funny. But I'm most, you wanted to do that. And they were patching me into the supervisor. And she says, oh, I don't want to be on Zeta. She doesn't like you and all that other kind of stuff. Ooh. She doesn't like whom he? Yeah, but the supervisor. Well, let her drop dead, okay? Okay. Now, let her stick her way to Mundo and shine. You know, you're good for my clients, right? Mm-hmm. He wrote to a jingle and I have it on tape. Okay. But now he says he says that he, I have to call him up and see if he wants to sing it live. Or should I play that to you on the tape? Okay. You shouldn't go. You're ready. Yep. I hope it's more exciting than this call so far. I have some other stuff I can't say. I can take the Glenn Harassing Barbie. I have not. Yes, he has called me up and played with you. He left 60 trolling messages on her machine. Well, that's not harassing her if I leave messages on her machine. He wanted to know who I'm going. Oh, boy. Yeah. Well, you're the one that instigated it so often. I think it's wonderful more power to us. He's such you up. Okay. You ready? Yeah. We're ready. Sounds good so far. Here it is. Two, three. 18 to late. Oh, how are you now feeling the morning? Imagine or believe you. I don't get all this crazy. We're on the right. Oh. Imagine or believe you. Do my dreams come true. And search you. Every little sweet thing. It's me. On 949. The Rockies on the radio. And tell me your secret. My name is Sammy. Where's Jay Michaels when you need it? That's right. How about? I'm to get Jay Michaels boombox when they can make sweet music together. Okay. Send me the instructions. You have my address. Okay. Have a wonderful life, sir. You think my class will go away? No, think my family. I can't help you. The truck is smoking. I like Jay, the family. I don't give my much. Can't help you. You're a family. Don't give my family. I can't tell you. You should've been mad, but that I don't care. I'll be back by dead. And tell me your secret. When I'm only ill. I'll give my kids to you. I'll definitely fool you. I'll give my kids to you. I'll talk you by my... Can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. I can't tell you. Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster. It's 744 on Zeta Fort. You have the feeling we kind of lost control of the show. Last couple of calls. Is that just my imagination? Everything is out of control. Oh yeah. Excellent. It's wonderful. Okay. And the phones are flashing like crazy. And those numbers are going to be out later in the day. What was he talking about? Like we're supposed to have a... Appaplectic fit about it on the air? About what? About those numbers. I mean, what can we do at this point? Number number number. Number number is it's all over. And his prediction is that they will double. Wrong. They're just no chance. Sorry. If they do, that would be very nice. But I don't do that. I think that would be a little high expectations. Always remember the set your sights low. And anything that happens above that is a bonus. It's a bonus. That's what Mark Kune is always saying. He sets his sights real low. Yeah. Over on the AM. And I think for this particular rating period, probably made the right decision. Do you know what I mean? Like fractions. That's where he said his sights. And that morning news, now have we still not heard? It's 7.46 on a Monday morning on Zeta 4. We have yet to hear. We've been asking for days from anyone. Whoever. I mean, even by accident, heard just moments of the morning news and the day before we got to the AM. But I don't know. But there's a problem there. We don't know for sure what it is. But now, as I said, we could be wrong. It could be that they're all very loyal. Sure. Wins listeners. And they're not turning over to where they're not here. That's correct. That's impossible. It's very unliked. Very unliked. In other words, somebody, somebody, I mean, they started 530. Well, now we got a call from Richard Vega. Now he's heard the show. Yeah, and you heard what he said. Everybody listens to the show. Cross section humanity. To watch you. Teenagers to old folk listen to the show. Lawyers, junkies. Everybody listens. Yeah, you know about the junk. Okay. We have an open line in date. Somebody just dropped off there. And I can't say that I blame them. 620 3600. 620 3600. After the news, by the way, we're going to hear John, What the hell is his name? Jonathan King. Yeah, John Brower. John King. Jonathan King and the he's so fine again. Because I got to get that back on. Okay. And also, and here, a bad finger. Mm-hmm. You found it? Isn't it a miracle that we have that in our library? Oh, I watched the Godfather over the weekend. Oh, did you? How did you like that? Remind me when you said library. Because that's one of the lines in the movie. The James Concess. Yeah. I tell you. Part one. Part one is incredible. Yeah. Part two is great. But part one is the definitive movie. It will cause violent grandmas and a violent cotton. Stuffed in his cheek. Somebody stuffed a 50-pound water cotton. Here at Chukin's part, like you will constipity too. If the Joseph the bearless. The opening scene is the only sitting behind the desk playing with the cat. Wonderful. I watched Part one Saturday in Part 2 Sunday. And wonderful weekend. You have a lot of invited media house for a cup of coffee. Hahaha. Hahaha. Oh, God. You're afraid that's silly, you're on. Movie making at its best. The old man Godfather. He's smiling. He's smiling. He's smiling. He's smiling. He's smiling. It's interesting. I like the Godfather and a Pope have that in common. Are they both want everybody to kiss their ring? The other coincidence. Got anything? I was going to say they're both from Italy. But this Pope is from Poland. That's her head. But lives in Italy. Do you think he's connected? Yeah. Anyway. If you can catch it on HBO. Part one is a must. Yeah. Part two is nice. Fascinating. But part one is the definitive. But you got to admit that Part two is the best sequel of a movie that was ever made. Usually Part two is a really inferior to the original. Part two is fascinating. Was it as good as the silicon? Yeah. We're going to head of a Titan movie. Set in Silicon Valley in California. That's what a puzzle is strange. Okay. Okay. Let's take another call. I will do the news. We've got all kinds of stuff to do here today. We have an open line in Dave County. Which seems to be part of the course this morning. How come we don't hear from more of our Latin listeners? I have no idea. Do you think that Zeta Four has a big Latin audience? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. There isn't any particular reason why we should. Is there? No. There isn't. In other words. No. No. Unlikely. It's incredibly. It would be incredibly if we did because we just don't play any music that relates to the Hispanic audience. Just like we don't play any music that relates to the black audience. What is it? We want this like Wasp audience. We want all Graham to. Is that it? We want to use just a couple. If you're around it, that's right. That's right. Geez. We've got the soul patrol. We could have like the Latin quarter. Yeah. And a kosher corner. Broward County. Hello. Very Christmas. Hey, same to you. Happy Chinooka. Hey. I'd like to commend you on what you're doing for the Canola House. I think it's really great. Yeah. And the mail really picked up today. I was very happy about that. Yeah. It shows you a really good person behind that cynical exterior. You got it. That's right. Well, we deep down inside somewhere. Yeah. You know, you try to hide it. Nobody's fowdered yet, but when they do, it'll be great. I was wondering if you had that Christmas song by the McKenzie Brothers. The one, both of you, the Christmas, where you get to beer? Uh, that may be around here someday. Yeah. We'll have to do what tried to dig it up. Not sure. Great. Yeah. I like that song. Good. And, uh, listen. I wanted to ask you to quit taking on people from silly, just because Joey Reynolds is from there. It doesn't mean you're all bad. Okay. Well, listen, there probably one or two good apples in Ed bunch. Yeah. It's got a lot of history. 200 years ago. There was a lot going on up there. Down here was only swamp land. That's right. And some of the garbage from 200 years ago is still lying on the streets. It's incredible. Yeah. And all the Indians were lying under the glades. Yeah. Like I said, Wilson good had the right idea. He just stopped too soon. This is Wilson good. He'd be the mayor of Philadelphia. Yeah. Right now. Well, I haven't been there in about 12 years. Well, I'd say that's good. Believe me. You don't want to go back. Okay. Just save her those great memories. Okay. So, Brooks are nice. Right. Like way out like Pittsburgh. Yeah. You have a food. Yeah. And you to cook. Okay. Listen, have a wonderful day. But the news be coming up next. You know what I mean? Have a good holiday. You too. Bye. Bye. 751 at Z4. Frank Sinatra is playing Santa 756 on Z4. Today we have to talk about that picture taking session that was scheduled for tomorrow. Oh, yeah. We're not going to do that. Uh, no. We're going to take a car wash man. Yeah. It is the car wash man. He's doing great. Anyway. He was my car. That's true. They don't want to wash mine either because it's too dirty. Anyway, getting back to where I was only moments ago. Sorry. What was I saying? Oh, yeah. Something about that picture taking session. Also, you notice when the news comes on. Like we had all the lines lit up. That phone now is not amazing. Like everybody just disappears. Think of few had to go to work. A few of them probably had to go to school or work, which is a pretty damn lame excuses. As far as I'm concerned, anyway, 620 3600 and date. And 779 3600 and Brower. This is the sparsis. This phone has ever been since we said down here. I can't. They're like two calls on at Bordina. Can't believe it. Is that incredible or what? And uh huh? There they go. Well, yeah. Another starting up again. But you know, we may have to play something here. Like music. And that sends them away like crazy. What are you now? All you would be rip off artists. And that's the final. I wish you would buy a man. And so far over land. One with way to land. I don't know how I'm going to do. What is mine now? I'm going to make it in mine. Here comes the song. They're the end of the... The metal. Time has me no. Here's the song's broken guy. What is mine now? You're off to sing. Have you decided? Makes me want a little party. You're leaving the given to try. But there can't be can't show. But there can't be can't show. Whenever I'm going to make it mine. Here's my six me forever. And there's one. He's so fine. So good. He's got a team of mine. So good. So good. So good. So good. And I hope it's not going to be good. So good. We got to get together. So good. The soon we're bound to be. So good. I'm taking weight. I'm taking weight. To be held in his arms. I'm not seeing a call. If I were a call. And he has to be totally new. So it's too dark. To make it happen to someone. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. So good. I'm looking for someone. I'm a self-character, John can kick next number two already with six bullets and rising rapidly to the top. Can you believe that? By 10 o'clock this morning is there any doubt? That that'll be the number one hit on Zeta 4. It's 8 o'clock here on a Monday morning. It's time for the ID Captain Mung. You smell that? I want the smell of new Rogers call out in the morning. It's a smell of an armored Sean victory. This is top of the Zeta, Miami Beach, or Florida, or near Palm Beach. Starting command of new Rogers and his attire shade, Glenn, and Burger Hill. Glenn, your sportsman will turn in turn on the wave. Boy, that exciting or what? I thought that was appropriate for today. Why is that? You know, victory. The smell of the snow. I don't want you, you know, everybody here is acting like we're going to have an 18 share or something when he's never first of all it's only two thirds of a rating period. Number one. And secondly, you know, we have a lot of work to do here yet. We started at Ground Zero. Everybody's impatient. Yeah. This is a whole different ball game, okay? Yeah. I know that. But that's when all your best when things are not running smoothly. Oh, well, then we ought to do great. That would be really great because based on the first few weeks here, I said last couple of weeks, man, talk about running smoothly. Now, wow. I have something to read to you. Are you sitting down? Yes. Do I look like I'm sitting down? Do I look like I shrunk a few months as over the weekend? Radio highlights. For today out of the Miami-Herald. Do they be good? Steve Kane, 2 p.m. W. I. O. D. Representative James Burke and John Broward. Oh, the scissor. Jesse Jackson. The scissor. Jesse Jackson again. What is there to discuss? This is the second show he's done this. The scissor. Jesse Jackson. I think if he had Jesse on a show, that would be bad enough. But discussing Jesse Jackson again. This man is so desperate for a show. You know, we owe somebody an apology. You know who it is? Who it is? Like I said, we owe somebody an apology. You know who it is? Stan Major. Talking about the Stan Major. Because all these, you know, all this crap about how he needs to get a show. Okay? And there's certainly an element of truth in that because he keeps ripping me off and just talking about me. And if it isn't Miami-Vicer, Don Johnson, it's near Rogers. But. But. Yeah. Everything's relative. Exactly. And at least Stan is listenable and you have some fun with him. I mean, the guy isn't doing the same old tired hackneyed crap that he's been doing for years. Like some other people in this market that we know and love. Right? One of whom you just mentioned. You know, I'm so sorry last week that I missed the 850th show. Who was it that he had all last week? Uh, do you mean an appleplex? It's every week. I don't know. He had Jack Lieberman on again for the 5 billionth time and that's just this year. And the year's not over yet. I wonder what they, he's having Michael D. Sisto on this week. I'm looking forward to the wrestling show. Oh, sorry. This man. And they're actually paying this guy. And I hear comes another guy. Is that Gary Lawrence in his $75,000 BMW at 804? What the hell is he doing here at this hour the morning? Let's hear it for Gary boy. He really puts in those hours. Doesn't he be gone by three? He really, he puts in his time, man. And by the time, but the time he finishes with his place, he ought to be putting in time. Just in joke, Gary. It's just in joke. And who is somebody other? These other original people like Alice Rand Tell, who is doing that thing with the attorney. Richard Esson. Today, Alice's guest is Steve Sonsky. I hear old TV critics. You know, and I think back to when I was on it night. Okay. And the early days and the daytime, although, thank God, very quickly, I woke up and smelled the flowers and the pansies. But you know, you come up with Tom, and I'm not saying these are bad people, but I'm just saying the repetition, Tom Jicker, and the nutritionist. And then there's Mike Spindell with a veterinarian. I mean, if he has Jan Bello's on again one more time, this decade next week. Oh, no, are you serious? Oh, listen. Oh, no. Over and over and over the same tried and true boring terminal, repetitive guests. You know, you're right. Of course what you say, you're absolutely right. But the elder's, the youngest. The youngest. And Bob Cunston, Alice Rubin, and the San Janet Reno, and the same, not in his boring, Ed Cohen. My good dear personal friend. Yeah, right. It's actually, you know this is an interesting point. Excuse me for interrupting, but I'm work up to an apoplectic friend. Do you notice how all of a sudden when things change, and people know that they're not going to be on your show anymore, that some of your good friends start turning a little bit. No. You know what I'm saying? Like on AM when I cut out the guests, all of a sudden my good, close personal friend, Ed Cohen, starts writing hostile things in the, and such a prestigious journal as the West candle visit. But about the New Year Rogers show, what a waste. Such a waste that I'm entertaining people instead of bringing a boring, washed out old man on like him to put the audience into a coma, right? And the same over here now that we're not at, and all of a sudden Tom Jika, oh, I don't get up at six in the morning to listen to him. No, because Tom is too busy listening to Mike Ranieri, pick his nose and I OD, okay? Why did you, as soon as I said that, you started wiping your nose. What's it, it's? But what? And you notice the pattern how they, they turn on you these people? Yeah, you know, everything you say. All they want to do is use you. They're all horrors. Don't you understand? All of these people are horrors. All these top show guests. Horses. And you, you, you, you nurture them and you develop them and you bring them on and you make them into again. All of a sudden they're like, I've got every damn show in town. Everywhere, like the plague. Can I get this one more time? What are they again? I don't know. Horses. Oh, you got two mobile calls? Mobile. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yeah, well, I heard you before you said that you didn't have any Latin listeners. Well, I didn't say we didn't have any. But I would just curious if we have many. Well, I want to give you a play on the rain gate for me. On the air. John even to her. He's a very popular on the rain gate player. And I, you know, want to get the Latin market. No, not that bad. Not that bad? No. Well, someone turned me on to you. And they said you would do it. They said I would do what? I might do it, but not that. You're a funny man, you know. I know. Oh, God. You love the show, don't you? I really do. And I really do. And how about your other Hispanic friends, my friend? Oh, when they out of jail, they listen to it. Oh, oh. In jail, they cannot listen to it. I know it doesn't penetrate those prison walls. Oh, they're thinking up to a man. We've been trying. So at Lanna, you got a second panel. So the radio check on ten of the big ones. Yeah, I sure do. Yeah, but we couldn't listen to it. Right. We tried, but we couldn't. We got one hundred. Yeah, that'll do it. Sonny Fox man. He's big and prison. Oh, yeah. He's good. He dresses up as a woman. Yeah, well, he's got a lot of experience, you know. Really, live in the or one more thing. Yes, sir. What do you think about the dolphins yesterday? How about that? What a division. Ah, they're seven and six in their time for first place. What a great division. All right. The two that Robyn's going to move the team over to Cuba. Yeah, Robby Young. They're going to build a stadium for him. Right. Have a wonderful day, sir. You have a great life, Neil. You too. Okay. Boy boy. Well, it's too distinctive. Yes. See how he's all he's convinced. Now, I just made that up. Yeah, it's too sweet. He's not okay. You know, if you've got a two five that's okay. Now, we don't know that we've got a two five that's just he just read some numbers. But they happen to be one two one nine two five. And that sounds like they fit into this time slot. All right. And if that's the case, that means we did over three in the month and over. Like maybe well over three, right? The decimal point is in the right place. But now if it's like a point two five. He's used to that. There's no problem. There's no pressure. Just like home. Yeah. Well, one thing about being consistent. There's something we'd be said for it. Okay. It's nine forty seven on Zayden. Now do we want to take, are you going to do news? If you, if you. Well, one thing about being consistent. There's something we'd be said for it. Okay. It's nine forty seven on Zayden. Now do we want to take, are you going to do news? If you, if you like. What do we got? How much have we got left? I don't have no idea what you're doing in there. And I guess that makes two of us, right? See, he's on the phone again. Should I play that thing on the phone again? Because he won't get off the phone. Why are you going to get off the phone? Because I think, what if we got three minutes? We have three minutes, right? Why does he, he just, he will not pay attention to me now. Why don't I just do the weather? You don't want to do the news? I'll be glad to. Whatever you want. We have time for it. Okay. What? He's back on the phone again. He's telling me, you know, he was just, you know, saying, If you can't take, he doesn't know for sure. I said, I told you that already. That you don't. We don't, we're not going to hold a gun to his head. I know. I think he's just a little worried. Maybe he was chest. But not as head. Cause what's there to blow out in his head, right? There's nothing there. Okay. Don't panic, cake, just relax. Whatever you say, you know, we're patient. We can wait. And if that's what it was, that'd be a bad way. We're not going to hold you to it. No. And if it's, anything lower than that, then look out because I know where you live. 948 out and stay to four. And the man who used to be bodyguard for it.
