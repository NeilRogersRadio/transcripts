And show that we are. We are telling the Oprah joke over the telephone. If anybody wants to call. Oh my gosh. Since our last Wednesday, everybody gets a good kick out of it. Are you cracked or what? It's make your own news Monday on WZTA, Miami Beach, Ford Lodderdale, and the Paul Meachers, seven o'clock on the Neorodges show with Glenda Bird Hill, Captain Dave, and Uncle Neal. You know, Jimmy the geek is kind of like the Vanu White of football in what way. Well, man, I'm telling you, he is getting, he is camping in up so bad on those pre-game shows now in CBS. He is a real-time. Him and Brent Mouse burgers. And they are doing this like slapping each other on the arm and hitting each other in the neck and belting each other. It's slapstick. It's embarrassing. That's what America is all about. You know, I'm not sure if you can get a white and Jimmy the geek. Think about it. Okay. Let's give those tickets away. And I really don't know how to do it. It is interesting. No, since I mentioned that that the action on the line seems to have increased dramatically, like they're all flashing frantically. Just. Just a few. What's your free loaders on FM, you know? The way to what the mail comes in today, there won't be much of anything. Remember Friday, we give them about 15 excuses. They're better not being in cassettes. Oh, yeah. They're better be a whole bunch of those pieces. You'll never see them again. Don't send them to them. Don't believe a word he says. He doesn't have the guts. He just wants to do that. Doesn't have the guts to do it ladies and gentlemen. They haven't pushed me far enough yet, but we're getting close. By the way, about those polaroid pictures, you know? You're never going to forget. You're never going to find some. Oh, no, not your pictures. I bought the camera. Oh, if you forgotten, it's only an hour since the show started. Is that a guilty conscience you're working on? Well, you keep mentioning some other things. I didn't know that Sally was taking polaroids. Yes, she was. Yes. She would have liked to have taken the ones that I found in my house. Ooh. Pretty interesting. Pretty surprising. Really surprising. Okay, where were we going to go? No, height one set. What set? Now, how did you just happen to stumble upon the pictures? Well, I wouldn't say stumble. Yeah, what would you say? What's the, what would be a good diplomatic word? Yeah. That's what I want to hear. Your big diplomatic word. You've encountered sifted through. No, not sift. If you were looking for something else. Yeah. Oh, what were you looking for? A panties. Did you find them? Yeah. Right with the pictures. Great. Anyway, who cares? Is it, you know, what difference does it make? I keep trying to explain that. But just curious. Okay. He doesn't know I found him though. I planted the seeds of paranoia. Okay. Where do we go next? No, we're not going to go to Colorado. How are we going to do this? I'll tell you what. We'll take six little pieces of paper. Okay. Oh, we're going to have a little, whoops. Why do you keep hitting them like this? Oh, that have been waiting and terminal. You know, something I couldn't give a damn less. Okay. So, I'll start with this goody two shoes. Who to be waiting long time. Maybe they're more ons. How do you know? He is so out of it. There. He has no idea what it is that we do. You know what? That's why I'm getting hip. I really like it. Long do we have three bucks? Oh, oh, oh, oh. What happened? I hit some sort of button. The machine went awry. Sorry, go ahead. He'll be all right. Don't worry about him. He'll be okay. She ain't. That won't worry. Okay, there's four. Five. See, this is the big time. This is the way we do it. How much does it stand? I'll be doing this just saying how many hundreds of these. There you go. Just six. Okay, I don't take up to the top seven. Eight. Ninety nine. We can kill this damn show in no time. 122, 123. It's okay. All right, here are these six lifts and paper. I just reached out and pick up one. Okay, here it is. We're going to add one. No, no, no. They're going to go through anyway. Hello. You're a winner. Yeah. I don't turn off to be a jerk. Okay, try to be a good guy because you want to take it. I just want to say that bread must be a jerk. Brent Mouse burger, he makes me sick. How about that Jimmy the geek? The play the dot. Yeah. You can say that again. What a deplorable game. How about those patriots? How about that Tony Franklin, Mr. That one yard field goal or whatever that one. I mean, that guy is just pathetic. I'm not Tony secret of the jerk too. And I want to you, Riff and Tony for Tony's a good friend of mine. Why do you want to rip everybody? I'm sorry. Tony's a good guy. Okay. If you say so. All right. Why don't you like Tony? You kicked the people out of the stadium in the orange. The other night and one guy got thrown on his head. What? What are you talking about? The police. The police? What does that guy do with Tony? He was doing a remote from the orange ball after they came. You're getting the sound a little like Howard Cousel. This call goes on. Great winner, Neil. Wow. Yeah. How would you like to give up those tickets, my friend? What are you taking, Mr. Rogers? Are you really want to give them up? I'm just being honest. I don't think this guy wants to take it. I don't think so. Okay. Bye. I don't see the direction the call was going. I couldn't get it. I'm not giving him a damn ticket. When he started cutting Tony, that was a... He didn't do that. He wasn't going to do that. He wasn't going to do that. If you don't want to give him to me, fine. Okay. Good. You don't get him. I don't think he knew what you were giving him. He doesn't know if he's just as sour. Another sour pour. Something free? Oh, I'll take the worst in a sour pour. It's six minutes past seven on Zeta Fort. And not all cheese. I threw the numbers away. Okay. Wait. I got to do it again. Oh, no. This will eat up a lot of time. Okay. Well, yeah. We'll do the weather while you're doing that. So today's and his number five. Yay. We haven't punched it up yet. Don't count your call or be foreign hansches. Hello. Oh, cheese. I'll get out of here. We can't even give the damn tickets away. Don't worry about it. Get plenty of time. Okay. It's fine with me. Now what's that? Is that an extra number? Don't ring this. Now this has got to be done kosher. Why don't you wait a while? Do it later. You want to do it now. You want to get out of the store later. That's a good idea. Yeah. This is number one. We can't even give him a more. I got another number one. Can't even give him a more. That's an amazing. What an audience we've got. Right? A bunch of morons. We want to give you the damn pair of you two tickets. And all you can do is call an act like Jackasses. I mean, if you can't even act a little bit civilized, forget it. We're not going to give you anything except a hard time. You came to the right place. Well, there are a lot of you out there. Probably would like that. I know I would. It's eight minutes past seven. It's eight or four. Jesus. Jesus. Louise. Oh, yeah. You have no idea what kind of household I live in. That's right. Deon Warwick is singing promises promises in my house right now. But it's all for not. Okay. So I guess we just turn off the phone. Let's start playing some music, right? Yeah, but you do have that great mud slide. And I'm real jealous. Okay. Should we play a level find a way by yes? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is the same guy who's playing a bubble brain by Paul Simon last week. Oh, the boy in the bubble and you were that yet a James cut. That was so embarrassed. Yeah. Yeah. Yet the James. Yeah. We need to play it all. Win more village. Yet to James. She's my favorite. Then we're going to send her a Wonder mug just for being a Zaytan loyalist. She's walking her dog right now at Winmore. Where did they get the name for the, I mean, what's the idea behind it being a Wonder? Do you want to, uh, 741? 777. You want to get it? No, it's 709. Oh, Jesus. Um, those people attempted humor of his, you know, getting out today, Captain Dave. Since he said call the police. He's never been the same. And since they line slipped out. It's he's still living on that. You know, this is not the lines are going nuts. I don't know what you people are calling for because we gave two people a chance to win those you two tickets and you couldn't handle it. You acted like bird brains. We don't want to be accused of sending bird brains to you. That's this Thursday, by the way. Can't talk about it in the orange bull. Why? It seems like we've only been promoting it for seven months. That's what December 3rd. And our promo says, we'll be there at the orange bull broadcasting live from 10 a.m. to show time. Is that exciting? Hmm. To personally thank you. We want to thank you for being Zaytan loyal listeners and look for his near gate 14 a with a limited number of Zaytan for you two t-shirts, bumper stickers, plates and cassette copies of the Joshua tree. Need. And that need oh. Yeah. And the gun's is going to be there. He's going to be giving away copies of that tape that goes. Hi, Jeff. They might even have some wonder mugs. Yeah. Maybe Jay Michaels will be there with some WINZ. One the mugs. To give away. The ones that he was supposed to give away Friday when nobody showed up. See, all of those, all of these idiotic things like it, the Ameriot and all these other, I mean, how many times can you go to the well and do the same thing, right? Right. And it's just like some of the stuff that happens with this station with the FM right Tony, Prado, you idiot. You got to be ashamed of yourself. She and that cherry home and they get together in the atrium, you know, and they're like, you know, they can't handle this. They can't handle the truth is finally out. I mean, if you're going to act like a bird brain, we're going to expose you for what you aren't. It's as simple as that. It's not like we're making it up. Am I right? Well, look at me. Who the hell is this? If the just drove in here, man, I'll tell you this place is really something. I know I do. Do you think people are coming back to work today? Uh, I don't know. I really don't die that um, he just drives around the parking lot about three times. Oh yeah. We like him a lot. He's the one that just lost the YouTube tickets. Oh, it was a mobile. Mm-hmm. Great. We still don't get any mobile callers. So you idiots in a mobile phone. I'm sorry. I don't know what your story is. Hmm. You understand that? I don't can't figure that out. I don't have a name. On A.M. we used to get jillions of people in mobile phone. How many? Couple. Ha ha ha. 11 after seven on Zeta 4. And Mar Valpert. Is it on his favorite group? Yes. It's a matter that you mentioned it. Well, we'll find a way. Speaking of other things from New York that we despised besides Mar Valpert. How about those giants, yes, today, huh? Looking good. Was that the um, Philadelphia game? No, that was the Washington New Yorker. Oh, who won that? Philadelphia was playing New England. I saw. So he had one word right. It wasn't New York. It was New England. Oh, yeah. I saw some of the overtime. No, the real wild game. That was a pathetic game. Wild. How does that troll? Transient. I mean, the Patriots come from behind. And unless they're 10 minutes to go, they tie it up. They blow a chance to win it. Then they lose it in overtime. I mean, that's just tragic. Are they kept kicking field goals? That's quite a division isn't it? The AFC. That's quite a division. Very well. And like the bills and the jet-star in first place. The bills. Yeah. Yeah. Now, who won the, um, the Washington Gave of Washington Luz? No, Washington won. Did they really block ran out as the giants got to the one yard line? I loved it. But all those New York mavens. Yeah. And Jimmy the geek. Oh, yeah. Half time. He was really gloating with giants. Giant's where way ahead. It's not at half time that counts. Jimmy, it's the score when the game is over. Oh. That's generally when counts. Yeah. Well, that's pretty revelatory. You don't get any, um, any brownie points in a standing for being ahead at half time. Is that right? It's like it. It would be like in a horse race. If, uh, you know, your horses ahead at the half mile pole. It doesn't count. Doesn't count. No. You ought to be ahead at the finish at the wire. Well, I appreciate you straightening. Yeah. Because that little confusion. That's what I'm saying. Oh, hey, listen, if being ahead at the half mile pole was what counted, I'd have a lot of money in my heart. I had a lot of those horses in front early and then all of a sudden they looked down at stretch. And it's puke city. Is that how you want to turn? Yeah, I think so. It's like those rides I was talking about at the brown county. It's a puke city. Yeah. 718 on Zeta 4 and let's take some calls. But if you think you're going to win the tickets now, or weasel them out of me, you're dreaming. You know, care if you give them a way or not. It's at all. You don't care. If you feel like you're upset that we did not have a presence. In fact, my being there was about the only presence of this station had the brown county fair. We appreciate you going. Yeah. Thanks a lot. It cost me a hundred bucks. I think that'll be a risk. Yeah. That's the better. I mean, I want to spend 20 bucks to win a 50 cent rob low poster. No, no, actually the posters. I don't understand that thing. I mean, all you got to do is throw the dart and it sticks in the poster. I don't know. And it gave it like five darts for a buck or something. Did they have any feeding? I mean, you got to be an idiot. You got to be totally inept. How many feebee posts? I mean, even Stevie Wonder was there in winning the poses of the dart. So it was quite like serious. I couldn't believe it. So no Kate's post. No, 50 Kate's. I had a couple of George Kate's post. Here's Moon glow in the theme from picnic on say to four. That's what we ought to do on that. Really screw him up. Get the consultants crazy. What kind of will I play Mitch Miller? Pat Boone. Pat Boone. Yeah. Any haywood? Remember soft summer breeze by any haywood? vaguely. Great record. Very vaguely. I think moody river would be good. Pat Boone. I would but for the moody river. By the way, if you want to copy the boon in the box, just send a stamp. We don't have any. Why not? There we mail them all. How can they be all gone? How can they be all gone? I don't have any. Sorry. Pat Boone sticking. Yeah, something through a box. Yeah. See the FM audience. They don't know what you're talking about. Yeah. What is he talking about? I don't know. All right. Let's take a call. I started looking at the screen. I should know that. What's just happened there? I like this. I like this. I like this. Hello. I just got one of my ear drums. Let me just change ears now. Sorry about that. Okay. Is he just better? Yeah. Much better. Okay. I just want to do a snore for those tickets. Oh, chance. No chance? Not a chance in a million. I figured since you were so upset over those last two cars, you'd get somebody who would be, uh, well, you figured wrong, pal. I figured wrong. Okay. Now, how do you like to show so far? Be honest with me. I'm a scale of one. So far, it's, it's a one. Yeah. I don't know if it's your same great show. As always. As always. Why still don't get the tickets? I don't want them now. Okay. Thanks. Thanks anyway. Thank you. Bye bye. Bye bye. Bye bye. There's no black tickets anyway. There, no blue tickets. Oh, geez. In other words, like, uh, if you want to be up in the helicopter with Alibar, you'd have a better chance of seeing something that we're going to sit with the Azadah. You mean, we've been lying to these people. I hear those promos where we say, we have all these choice locations. Oh, yeah. Front row seats. Really? These front row. No, no, these will no. It does not say front row. I don't start seeing things like that. You'll create a problem. Let's wait. Jack and get here. We can ask them. Front row tickets. Yeah. I thought I heard a promo. That's something about that. I just heard that you had to share one of the tickets with Saredman Hillary. I got news for if we had front row tickets. Gary Lawrence wouldn't have him. True. Okay. And his family. You know that he has a son. Who's his girlfriend. I was going to say he has a son who's daughter, but that wouldn't have been right. He has a son who's girlfriend is a waitress at the Melding Pot and Cross brings. Did you know that? Oh, yeah. That's one of those good looking girls that were there. That has to be because they don't have any ugly girls that worked there. Want to bet? Okay. 21 past seven. Yes. On Zeta 4. There's something wrong with this. I don't care what you say. It just doesn't sound right to me. Do you sound hollow? What? What? You say what? Yeah. Little hollow. I don't think so. And just not. I think it is. And you got on your head. What are you talking about? I bought these with my own two cents. These are great. What's wrong with these? What's our senheiser? 60 bucks. Wow. 722. Okay. Let's call Greg and Donald and let's see how they're done. Browered County. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, dude. How you doing? Okay. Let's see. Yeah. Let's do it on you from for S.M. Mr. Sunshan. What about him? I'm talking to the Friday of Thursday. Tony's saying, you don't have a show on it. It's just not a complainable. Right. That's right. Oh well. I don't believe in any rickles. I'm going to for years. But he's still around. Well, at least we have a show. Okay. You've got one. The list of guys on this is more I can say for some people on the business. Not to mention him. And by the way, when we started locking this door, the man was actually crying in the atrium out here. I can believe it. A grown man in tears. And I'm a cherry with that door, like that. That's right. I'm a little narrow over the phone. What is it? Well, that's because of this lousy speakerphone. Is this a little better? Oh, I got great. Okay. Hey, don't blame. Oh. Isn't that good? That might be helpful. Coffee. Great. Yeah. Yeah. I got some old dirt on it. It's down over there. This is a while ago. Yeah. You're talking to some English guy. You still look still with it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know where we're going. Go ahead. Rip the crap out of the bottle, okay. Yeah. So, y'all, this guy called up saying, I'll great you were. You are. You know, this is after you left and I'll great you. Yeah. He's trying to get him in the word. He says, stand. You should use this word. You could instead of kneels, in credible. He should say, or in this, you know, that was. Oh, there's a different eternal land. He's believable. Yeah. I've done, uh, to be able to sing it to him. But what do you think? If we make it make it big, they'd let us sign over in the, in England and the guy says, oh, no, he's never good on anyone. And, uh, St. said, well, maybe they take kneel in England, and, you know, and he said, I guess there was a reference to, that maybe they ain't got you a little swishier, something, you know. The English are a little swishier. What do you want from people to worship a queen, sir? Yeah, right, right, right. Yeah, all the facts. I didn't even say that. This guy, I recognize this guy's voice from, you know, before I was at two here on, Don't I, N.C.? Yeah. It was the guy that, if it was the same guy to call that, he was used all the way. I can't follow you. I went there, you know, the Canadians in Bitson, out the Queen and the Royal Family. Yeah. But apparently, you can brewer them along the way, because he was, you know, talking good about you. Right. Okay. Well, listen, it's been an illuminating call. Yeah, I guess it's been great. You're like the thinker, you know, J.J. Michael, you've got to chase me over to Y and Z about a year and a half ago. Yeah. It's me out there, thanks. So, uh, appreciate it. Yeah. Listen, I'll lean. I'll lean. I'll lean. I'll lean. I'll lean. I'll lean. Would you say goodbye, please? Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay. I mean, he was not a bad guy, but he could have, he could have gone on to line 30. Oh, yeah. We could have written up, up to number 400 on the slips, and he would have still been out. Look at those phones, man. These people are like, vultures. You ought to be able to relate to that. All they got to do is sniff that there might be something for free. And the lie that just going crazy. It was a typical Monday morning, and it was not much happening. And all I did was mention at one lousy parrot tickets from, like, up in the rafters there, like, in fact, it's in the John is where you sit. The people might like, no, it could be some good tickets, but I was just presuming since it was the last. But you don't really know, but you just open a big mouth and you make it sound like we're a bunch of, we already had various stars, by not being into Broward County fair. Now you're trying to say that the YouTube tickets were given away are stiff. Is that what you're trying to say? No, what's stiff? You get you in the orange bowl to hear the great music. Yeah. And smelly aroma. Okay. Okay. They're bad tickets, but bring binoculars. 26 past seven on Zeta 4, and let's go to, well, I guess, Dave County. Hello. Hi, Neil. I like to talk about Brett Mussberger. Brett Mussberger? Yeah. That guy proves that there is gravity, because his eyelids are hanging lower than the well. And this guy, so he's funny thing about watching the game, Saturday wasn't just enjoying watching Notre Dame getting their butt kicked. It was just like Brett Mussberger trying to cover up for what he said about you and like, they're not a great team or anything. Yeah. What the hell does he know? Right. I got an idea, Neil. Why don't we take the UM defense and put it with a dolphins? Just take the kill with dolphins defense. I know, but against a wholesome one, little Havana and shoot him. Oh, come on. She may be wound him a little bit, but not, not kill him. I mean, Dhammarine is allowed to have a day off. And Dan Marino yesterday was like, out to lunch. He wasn't even there. They were playing. Her play and buffalo and he was in win more. He had a thing for two years. He was in win more village looking for a one-demon. Yeah. Well, listen, good luck to you, sir. Okay. Have a nice day. You too, have a wonderful life. Shoot. Nice young man. Only a football game. Hey, listen, what's more important? Yeah, really. How are your priorities? Yeah, you're right. I got to get my priorities straight. That's done, show them man. What a jerk. The game is passing him by. Yeah. Life is passing him by. We got that great, beautiful new stadium. Now we need his football team. That'd be great if we had a team. Who may be Piper High could take over? Or maybe killing in hot. Speaking of stadiums and colesms, as such, I heard from a good source that the heat is history. Are you serious? I mean, it didn't sell the 85,000 tickets that they need to sell. That's the same academic anyway. Really? That it was over. Hey, wouldn't that be great? Now this would save us one of the another embarrassments. I've had a lot of embarrassments in his town, but this would save us yet another colossal humiliation. I heard they're going to use the colesms to play concerts. Really? I heard they're going to have cock fights there. I think you're right. Yeah. Neil. Why does Dia summing goes? And what all the new Cubans come in, man, we got to have something they can relate to. Can they can roll? Money will just roll there. Isn't that what we need to see more refugees here? I think that's exactly what we need to kind of spice up our lives. It's been boring. I've been pretty boring. Let's have about 50 million refugees. We'll bring them all into date, County. It's nice to see. Just keep them out of brown. Yeah, no brown. Oh, and yesterday you would have you would have died. If you'd have seen this on this week with David Brinkley, they had Mayor Suerzon. Who? Xavier Suerz? Oh, yeah. Swaraged. Anyway. Oh, I saw that. And did you see the, was one of the funniest things I ever heard in my life? He said the Cuban immigrants who came here before 1980 set all kinds of records for productivity and getting jobs. And I thought to myself, where do you look that up? Like, where is the record book to find about productivity of immigrants, you know, like, like it's like saying, well, when the Irish came in or the Jews came in or the polls, you know, in the early part of the century, they weren't very productive, even though they worked in the sweatshops 30 hours a day. But we're, how can he come up with a line like that and get away with it? You know, and all these great journalists, George Willis sitting there and Sam Donaldson with that plastic face of his and David Brinkley was a good guy, but he's been mummified for at least five years now. They just let it go. They've got the Cuban immigrants who came here before 1980 and said all kinds of records for what? What the hell is this man talking about? What a panter he is just the worst. I think they have records in cockfighting. Yeah, oh, no question about that. It's a Santa Rea, or at least in part of that. It's 730. This is let that go. On Zeta 4. Yeah, I was fighting is what I was talking to. Now, somebody out there with a dirty mind, you know, so there's another indecent shot. You know, that buddy nevens at this new slum Sentinel? What is with that guy? What's with that Bayervory day? Every single day has got another story, but it's a non story. There's nothing going on, buddy. Anything you read in that paper I would take with a grain of salt. That paper is just incredible. They don't, when is their spot coming up? Oh, God. Okay, yeah. Thanks. Rowered County. Hello. Stand. How you doing? Okay, George. How are you? You're the greatest man. Yeah. Oh, change. Yep. He can't. Okay. Don't buy a house. Wrong show, but the right idea. Right idea. Right idea. He was good. He was perfect for standing. Stand is good. He's following, you know, basically I almost said dead air. That would have been nice because J wouldn't like that. But they're desperate over there, you know what? And at Mark Q and he's going to turn that AM into a parking lot. Is he? Yep. You predicted that a while ago. Oh, well, when he first came here, he's a matter of fact. I think he just gave this man enough time and enough leeway man. He'll turn this whole place into a gigantic parking lot. And he can. The same man who gave us that thing to Calum. And to Marbing Tuz Day that brings to my talk net, you know. And all that other brilliant innovative talk man, the same guy who gave us that is going to really do a number over there. You can go to the bank on it. I thought he said he was going to, I don't want to say how small the number will be. He said he was going to turn it into a Chinese restaurant. Or two-browered lines, not flashing by the way. Wouldn't you be embarrassed and humiliated if we give away the U2 tickets on one of the lines that you're not ringing right now? What does that mean? At 7779, 3600, how could we give them away on a line that's not ringing? Well, what you meant was wouldn't it wouldn't you be upset if you gave it to him? You weren't calling. Yeah. Could be you. Oh, there they go. Now we're not going to give him away right now. But you never know. Howard County, hello. How are you doing today, Neil? Great. How are you? Oh, I'm hanging in there hanging in there. Very good. Yeah. I'm not about it. The fear was so much fun. I'm going to try to make it to the circus. So one of these years. Have you ever had that fried dough? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because I looked at it and it looked so tattly. I can't eat stuff like that. But I got the fried food. We'll do it. That's the only thing. Go on one of those wild rides, right? Yeah. And get off and you can't stand the pair anymore after that. I think that's what kind of kept me away. As I remember that. You go on a couple of rides. Well, I was all of the things. All you smell is kind of like greasy food. No, there was a lot of good food there. In fact, I'll tell you what I did have. I had one of those Italian sausage sandwiches with peppers and onions. And I know that's our good. Oh, exactly. Man, you have to have those every time you get any kind of pair. Yeah. I got a two year old here who when he hears your promo that Neil Fong, he starts singing it. Oh, great. I could never get him to sing it with you on right now. He does sing it when he hears it. Well, we like the kind of infantile touch on his show. Yeah. Makes me feel it. Makes me feel it home. Yeah. That's really good. Now, do I win the YouTube tickets for that? No. Oh, well, at least I tried. You know, I gave it my best shot. You sure did. Okay, you have a good day today. You too. Okay, bye-bye. YouTube. YouTube. YouTube. 733 on Zeta 4. New up in the morning. Neil wakes me up with a smile. With a smile, yeah. Drink my coffee. Bungin' on my donut. We're still for a good time. Get ready to go to school with Neil. We're safe to follow the dial. Do it into work in my room with a darling Neil. We're safe to follow on my dial. Oh, really? Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. Neil. What do you think of a guy who rides you round a retail store with a thing on his back? A thing that's as unbelievable and incredible. What was his name again? Now, that was his card. Forget it. That would be embarrassing. It was Wolf camera in the hour. You know, in the hour. The hour glass. The hour ball. The hour ball. Molly's, I guess all of them all is not just packed. Oh yeah. Oh God. With incredible looking people these days. I told you. Yeah. So if you're into shopping or you're into trolling, good luck to you. Any mall, do I think? Anyway, I turned around. We were sitting there at the circus and I turned around and I looked behind me. It's 25 before. It was one of the most freaky things that has ever happened to me. What are the odds on that? Who is this very attractive young man? I would say 20. Yeah. And a nice looking young lady. Oh, we're getting close to this story again. Well, I've already kind of like spelled it out. What do I have to say? No. I got it. Did you? It was kind of kind of alluded several times. As a matter of fact, but that's another story. Yeah. Anyway, we don't want to go into that because that could be interpreted as indecendient and immoral and offensive to decency and morally offensive and all of that other. But I like this kind of like Tony Prado. I thought it was a good story. That's going to be our poll question. Little later on, I'll say it a four day. Seriously, is Tony Prado indecend or obscene? Our promotions director. We're bringing in Lee himself to do that poll. Does that be all? Yeah. I think that's a poll that calls for a professional pollster. So Lee, if you're listening. Yeah, we're not bringing it up. She's going to get all bent on a shape. Oh, I know. She's going to be whispering with Sherry Hall in the hall. Oh, I'm not saying that. I'm not saying that. You can't say out of it. I was surprised. You went on a, when are you called him? They went on the air with it. Oh, that was just a scoundrel. He didn't understand. He got a real sound. It's just terrible. There's still upset about that. I mean, what do you want? You still want your point three, honey. Is that what you want? Because we can arrange it. You know what I'm saying? No problem at all. Call up Jeff Chase. Get him back in here. That's good for an immediate one point decline. Automated. If you want, you're only doing a one. So why do they still have Jeff Chase's picture in the office? You notice are they trying to give us a message? Like none of us, okay, isn't it interesting? This is the morning show on what is obviously the more important to them of the two stations. So this is the biggie. And none of the three of us have a picture anywhere on either wall, not just on the FM wall, but AM, BM, BM or FM. There is no picture of any of us. But Jeff Chase. But Jeff Chase, who doesn't even work here anymore. He's got this beautiful color portrait. It's a good picture. Yeah. Don't you have a Polaroid camera? Yeah, I'll bring in my Polaroid. Oh, we'll get Sally. We'll bring in our specimen camera. I'm bringing some of those pictures. Yeah, why don't you do that? I don't have no idea. They're in Atlanta. 737. Trust me, on Zeta 4. And where shall we go next? To you, asked? Oh, I see. Don't worry about it. I'll just put some of my pommies to this. Dave County. Hello. Hello, New. Hi. I'm a champion. Not much. What's happening by you? How come you're not in school yet? Huh? Say what? I got suspended. You got suspended for what? I'm fighting because I was black here, you know, less mislead. A black here wrestled with you? No, less with me. Oh, you messed with it. You saw a fight with them? Yeah, and now you're both suspended. Yeah, I'll put me up. Where did any of the adults get off Carl and you and tell you that I want to take this in person? Yeah, what kind of morons are they, right? Yeah, I mean, first call, I'll see you and tell you, first you wanted to take it straight and told you. Yeah, then he started ripping Tony's cigarette on. Nobody ripped Tony's cigarette on my show. He's a good guy. I know. I mean, I was going to call you on that name every day. Did you just find this? Yeah. You believe that blah, blah jerk. You know what? You're still not getting the ticket. No, the black kid that he got in the black. Yeah, you went into black kid that you were fighting with. We wouldn't give any of the tickets, but you're suspended. I knew. Yeah. I also suspended it as sentence. I also suspended as sentence. Remember that in the godfather? Go ahead. What are you talking about? I asked you questions, but I'll be sorry to the studio. Let me say this to you. If you would say, ask you a question, then you and that black kid wouldn't be fighting. I asked you a question. Okay. Ask me anything. All right. No, I asked you how I gave you the studio. Oh, yeah. That was a great call. Yeah. And you thought I was going to give you the tickets? You said you said that you would have my answer tomorrow. What is it to you? Why are you concerned about what people are doing with their private parts? I like it. So, what people are doing with their private parts? Are you writing a book? No, but I heard you had a 96, I'd be so sure. Okay. Have a nice day. I'm going to start talking about Queens at Power 96. Oh, really? Is that where he was headed? We don't have enough time for that call, sir. It's... I didn't kind of, because I was afraid he was going to say, I just don't have that much time left in the show. That's right. If he starts running down that list, like reading the phone book, you want to play a spot? No. It's not due till the end of the hour. This is no spot Monday. No, you're wrong. You're absolutely wrong. We got three minutes. No, it's not. It's the seven o'clock. One and next hour, we got three minutes. In the last hour. I think we got four this hour. Oh, yeah. You're right. We do have four this hour. Why don't you go in there? We'll play two of them now and two of them later. Seven, four. We're going to do a four minute break just because you're sitting here on your ass. You idiot? That was within. Anyway, man, he just comes in with a cup of coffee. It is tangy. We're eating. Hey, baby. I'm just laughing around. Yeah. I'm playing most of the music. I'm Cart today. You notice he's like, uh, got nothing to do in there. Yeah. Played yes. And that was his, like, his big production number for the day. Okay. Let's do a little break. It's a six seven eight. What the hell is it now? Seven seven forty. Are you sure? Yes. I am. Are you pausing? According to my Cassio. Twenty-two late on Zeta Four. We're eating on the morning. These are people who are lying. These got the better way of it. They're saying the search of the bride. The morning the one who's a little bit, you'll say. Oh, they were honest. All for the day. Oh, they were honest. All for the day. Soon I first heard him. With his whittle light. He's still a soul. But always excited. Now I always hear him. But won't get to hear him. All who knows when you look at my rear end. That way. He's the new morning. He's the full light. He's got the better way of it. They're seeing the search of the bride. The morning the one who's a little bit, you'll say. Oh, they were honest. All for the day. He's the new morning. He's got the better way of it. He's got the better way of it. They're seeing the search of the bride. The morning the one who's a little bit, you'll say. Oh, they were honest. All for the day. All for the day. All for the day. I love what I do this. All for the day. All for the day. Oh, they were honest. I can't hold it that long, they were honest. They were honest. It's a 745 on Zeta 4 that's Elvis Junior and never sounding better. They had an Elvis impersonator at the fair. But I don't think it was him. You don't think it was Elvis Junior. No. Because it seemed like a bigger guy. He's kind of like a small guy. You've met him. Yes, I have. Good guy. I like him. And for a minute I thought it was him because the guy was pretty good. But I don't think it was him. Well, this guy doesn't look like Elvis. Well, it's like these guys. They like make up and look like him. Yeah. And he could probably do that. But the guy was too big. Uh-huh. To be E.J. Some of them think. Some of them went out of the knife. You know, it had plastic surgery to look like one under the knife. Interesting choice of word. That's it. Now, wait a minute. Who is that? That's just what running out there again. Was that that same maniac AM salesman again? Probably. And more people are coming into the compound. Well, are they coming into the compound? Well, sure. Well, they're coming into the compound. So we were here on Friday. We were here on Thanksgiving Day. It sure is nice seeing some of you come back to work again. Some. Yeah. Now you have something to be thankful for again. Next Thanksgiving Day. If you're still here. Who's coming in anybody? I can't tell you. Tony Prado here yet with her sauce. No. It's the car wash people. Oh, great. Those are some of my favorite folks. Oh, I did the wash my car yesterday. So I will pass. Now who's behind the car? Sales. Sales people. Mm-hmm. You're going to have to go to the next one. Now that looks like Gene Cashman. Now there he goes. He's leaving. Didn't that look like Gene Cash? Who's leaving? The AM sales not Gary. Yeah. Gary. Is it in his same Gary? Lawrence? No. Gary Lawrence is leaving? Totally. He just got here and he's leaving already. Okay. Well, Lawrence family is listening. Boy, you believe they gave us a window. I don't know if they. Yeah. I love it. And you know that they hate it. These people can't stand it. In fact, we're sitting here monitoring that. Yeah. Bye-bye. Okay. You too. Little hyper. Who hammer me? He was a little hyper. Can't turn me off though. That is good guy. And pretty soon we'll get somebody called in to turn me on. That would be a good start. You believe he lived in this town. You know what I mean? Like, I don't want to troll on the ear like Stan Major. But it's getting to the point now. If something really exciting doesn't happen soon. I'm going to have. I'm going to go to Sweden and have that operation. Finally. Yeah. Okay. Will we be doing the show? I don't know. I don't know. I might sound a little different when I come back. I might sound like Michael Jackson. But I just, you know, sooner or later something's got to happen. Something good. Something good. I mean, why did that happen at the circus? Why couldn't I have been, for example, in Windixie? And as I went around the corner of one of the aisles with my shopping cart, I could have run into that same individual. That's correct. And at that point, if he would have probably would have been alone. And I would have said, gee. That would you. It's a good time for something. But not me. That's not my luck. I turned around to there. He is with his very attractive young lady, by the way. She was very nice. It is so hot in here. It's not my imagination. And you know what I don't understand when we played Mitch Rider. I went out in the hall and in the atrium. And it's like freezing. I know. I know. But there is no air where it's got to be comfortable. Don't you people understand it? You manage to be you mismanagement people. It's got to be comfortable. You've got to be able to breathe to be on the air. Really? And they just, well, it helps. It does help. You know, it never hindered Alan Courtney that he wasn't breathing all those years when he was on the air. But most of us, it does help if you're breathing a little bit while you're on the air. A little bit. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't bother Bill Ross on Channel 7. He has some breathing for 15 years. Barnaby Jones gets his man. Oh, she's. 29 past eight on Zeta 4. And we're going to take a call from Boka. Boy, this is pretty exciting. Hello. What a meal. How are you? Good. How are you? I wish everybody to go with the Hungarian girlfriend, John Coyne, from Boka. Oh, yeah. How you been? All right. Listen. I sent you a little something through the mail. Yes, so you should get up within a couple days. I know you're a big Michigan State fan. A friend of mine went up there to watch the big game against Indiana. A couple weeks back. I told him to bring me up a program. And when I got my hands on it, I immediately sent it to you. I said, you like Michigan State, I hope you enjoy it. Great. Along with that program, I sent a cassette for the bird. It's going to be in a big envelope. You know, UPS, whatever. Well, that first tape. Wait a minute. You mean like a blank cassette? Oh, of course. Oh, good. Oh, that'll go right in the right of my way. I told you not to send me any of those. No. Don't listen to them. On that first cassette, Neil. Send those tape. Wait, wait. Is there one? Wasted away on howl, Soundel. Is that on your first cassette? Yes. Thank God. I'm trying to get that desperately trying to get that wasting away from Soundel song on there. And then another thing, it always seems every day. I listen to you guys that the next day, it's hard for me to realize that the show gets better. You seem to go one step above the day before, but, yeah. Yeah. I can't imagine how you guys keep topping yourself day after day. Well, we're climbing so high pretty soon. The show'll be on Mount Rushmore. Yeah. And I know that you're catching me to relate to that. Hey, Karen, you're the magazine. Have a great day. Hopefully. Let us know what goes on at that meeting tomorrow. Okay. We'll get you the inside scoop. See you later. Good luck, Jean Cash. But I apologize to Jean. It's Arlene Ross, who's but is depicted up on Mount Rushmore. I feel like the way Captain David is. He got a lot of noise. It was you to know. Yeah. Yeah. No, I like that. It's a morning show. And we want to keep the audience alert and awake. Now, who's driving it in that vehicle? What is that? Wow. This is it. Pretty strange stuff that comes in in this building. You know what you notice? Most of it is guests on the J. Michael's show. Out of the station on Mount Radio. Wait till a book comes out check. Not very locked in, David. What's that major on Mount Radio? All together now. Who got it? I guess you say. Double you. I am to be too dumb. I don't think so. It's a... Can you believe that? I come in for those of you who missed the beginning of the show. And I realize this is a little in. Okay. But I think if you're somebody who's... Okay. But I think if you're... Somebody who's listening to me for a while. If you stop and think about this, it'll give you an idea where... How totally confused and chaotic and screwed up this place is. I come in here this morning and I always come into side door through the newsroom because that's the only place you really can get in. And anyway, what's his name again? Dave Reynolds. Dave Reynolds. I don't know why I keep forgetting his name. But the... Speaking of our good friend, there he is. David Reynolds. Wait a minute. We have to wait with the story. Talk about Stamachess. Because Jay just drove up. But anyway, I come in and Dave Reynolds is there and he says... And he's a pretty good guy. He says good morning and I told him, eh, yeah. And he says, by the way, over by the sports, there's a green copy thing there for you. He says, I think that's a spot for you. And immediately, that puzzled me because why would a spot that has anything to do with the station with Zeta be in the AM newsroom. Okay. And I go over and I look at it. And it's a spot for mineralize. For the AM. I mean, obviously, we are not running mineralize spots on Zeta. Okay. And I don't think it's going to start between now and next look at it. And it says, Neil, to re-cut. Neil doesn't work on WINZ anymore. I mean, are those people out of their cut and pick in mines? Maybe they don't realize. See, before I left over there, there were some spots that I cut in my voice, which they have continued to run. And there were some other ones that we did for here that they took a dubb of and they played on the ear up there. But that's it. I don't work for that station. I've nothing to do with that. Thank God. I've nothing to do with WINZ anymore. And I mean, nothing. Well, I want to disavow any association with that part of the building. Why don't you ask Jay Michaels about that? And then when I'm finished doing that, I want to disavow any association with this part of the building. No, Jay's the production director on the AM. Well, I don't think it was his writing. I know, but why don't you ask him? He would know, but he knows that I'm not going to do that. There's not a chance in 10 million. Well, when he pops in over here. Well, I saw him with his briefcase and his party kid just came in. Did he have his red pants? And his red pants and his chemistry said it's 834. It's 834. You know, there's a guy in my complex who has a little dog, Doug, and he walks this poor he drags his dog around all day. And you remember me talking about the guy Wayne who called in and turned out to be a pretty decent guy. But Wayne is like out there all day. All day. I don't know if he works. I don't know what his story is. But this guy is not only outside of it, but he's walking that dog any time more. You can come at three in a morning. He's now walking that dog. So I kind of thought we could have and not only that, but I have two other neighbors who are very nice people on the other side of where I live. Who are obsessed with washing their car. I mean, you know, I like to keep my car clean when I get a chance. But it's something to be obsessed with washing your car. Okay, in fact, if you open up my door and I walk out front of here, car wash blues like 15 hours a day. And they're out there scrubbing and waxing and polishing and waxing and scrubbing and ripping and tearing. And I thought it would make we could make an interesting movie in my complex. You know, here it would be Wayne wandering around looking like hairy reams. You know, with all that football all over his body, just wandering around aimlessly being a yenta. And here be this guy dragging this poor little dog at a leash. You know, and then there would be my other friend who's like the space could have wandering around aimlessly looking like somebody who got lost from the hairy christmas. And then the other people wash it frantically washing the store. Man, it's what a scene. But you left out my favorite character. Which one is that in the movie? Well, the guy who runs out into the parking lot and the second he sees you come at your door. Well, that's the same guy who runs and who wanders around like the space called that. That's it. Like it's basically like a wandering Jew. Yeah. And what does he yell out? Oh, yeah. Like different Yenish word that are totally disconnected like. Uh, gefilter fish. Uh, Tusses. Uh, that is out of the blue. Yeah. Cox a high. You know, little cuties at the top of his love. Yeah. That have nothing to do with anything. That's what I'm saying. Symsa Starah. Tissue ball. Why don't we write a screenplay? Yeah. I'm talking. I think we've got the we've got the cash already set. It's like a real potential there. We could call it complex. Yeah. And Richard dryfus could star as you. We get river Phoenix. Yeah. Yeah. We'll be great. Phoenix could play my roommate. Yeah. No, I don't think so. 836 on Zeta 4 and the worship we go next. He asked to line, is that amazing that we did the show just keeps going on and on and on? I mean, are we making up for lost time now or what? Just, oh, there she is. Hey, by the way, I got a little present for you. Sure. Write me some copy. Will you honey? I'll be more than happy to do that one of these days. But get serious. I just thought it was an endorsement spot. Well, I got news for you. I don't write copy. You know, the first time I did a magnificent job, but when I get pushed, I start getting testing. And what about that spot for the AM? I had nothing to do with you. I mean, can you believe you hear that story? Yeah. I come in this morning. Here's a spot for me to recut for I.N.Z. I don't work at I.N.Z. I have nothing to do with I.N.Z. I don't want anything to do with that station. Can you give you yellow sheets, not green ones? Yeah, okay. Oh, that's the difference. Write me some copy, please. Too much hanky, panky with Paul. I'm gone. And I got news for you. Nothing's ever going to come with that. Okay. Where are we going next? Broward County. Hello. And now what it is? What it is. I got some hot jewelry though. What's what you mean? Oh, you got some hot stuff? I got some hot stuff. Okay. Well, you bring it in about what happened to Bigger. We have a big sale two in a morning tomorrow morning. I got the best feeling down. Wait a minute. I got to watch you. Let me take a look at it. Let me take a look at this. Write, panky, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's a cycle from JC pennies. Okay. It was about 2.29. I can't. Not 2.0. Not 2.0. Oh, that's good because it's only 2.0.0.0. Okay. Oh, man. You jazz. I'm not being jive and you be ill and ser. The pertone. You'll be over there with the gross relation. Okay. All right. See y'all. That's somebody called from the Thunderbird. Yeah. The flea market. Yeah. Are you really good? We need just one and that's to tie around Tony Prado's neck. What's up man? Oh my god. I didn't recognize him. Elvis. Elvis. Elvis. Put Elvis over here for a minute. And, you know, let's put him on first. I didn't recognize you. It's been so long. I know. You weren't at the Broward County Fairwell. No, but I was one of my daddy's. Yeah. He was pretty good. Was he really? Yeah. Not as good as you, but he was good. I have a cartoons show y'all. It was Junior in this morning to USA today. Did you guys happen to catch this week's national inquire on the area? He was reading it on the area yesterday. And it's kind of runs parallel with the tapes that you got. Something about my daddy talking from his grave. Yeah. That's what this cartoon kind of get upset about that. Yeah. Read that cartoon in USA today. I think we have a grave situation. No, too. That's good. But what did say? Yeah. Now your daddy was big on jewelry all of us. Every big cartoon. You think he was in a story of my life? I was visited by the ghost of an old as impersonating. Yeah. Yeah. jewelry. I've heard about this. Woman coming in here to sell jewelry. Yeah. They're great. Oh, yeah. I think I'll come up with your daddy's jewelry. Maybe in a collection body. I'll make a special trip to come in here. I'll make sure. I have to make a special trip this morning to come in because I'm coming in the cut of spots. And I don't think I don't want to replace anything that you guys have done because I think that is the spot. The spot. The spot. The spot. The spot. Maybe you'd like to cut this mineralized spot that they're going up there. I think the spot that the bird did for the brick oven is. Yeah. She going to the archives. Yeah. My favorite is where he says a slice of peat. That's my favorite. So you can't you can get close to it, but you'll never. Nobody can do that. I don't think I can never do that. No. And I don't even hope to replace that. Now, wouldn't think. Long as you know that. I think it should go in. So what are you really doing here? You're hanging around for Stan Majors at it. As he milking another free performance off you today. Not quite. I'm actually in here to do a spot. I've done a lot of work over there. And I really. I'm still living in the phone booth. So I have to make money somehow. So I'm coming in here to do a spot. I wonder how he takes those showers in that phone booth. The ones that he calls in on the air with the Michelle. Oh yeah. Remember Michelle? No, that's not Michelle. Her name is Suzanne. And you've got to use her name used to be Michelle. You've got me into a lot of trouble there, but it's really. So in other words, we have a little change of characters. Some of you know what sort of speak. Yeah. Mm-hmm. That interesting. Do you think Stan will be upset that you dropped in here for a few minutes? I'm really worried. Yeah. You may not like that. I think we ought to play in honor of Elvis's appearance here. We ought to play that one straight one straight. If you're part in that expression. Yeah. But he always said don't be cruel. Yeah. I think that's what he was. I didn't even know that was being recorded out. That was right after we. That's right after we did the Stan majors don't be cruel version. And I think I forgot one of the versions. Yeah, that's what we like about it. He said you just sort of go away for a minute. So we like that. If you can't like when I go away. That's not just for a minute. There's a few people like that. No, no, just for a minute. Don't tell me that it disappeared. That would be, that would be so obvious is to where it went. If it disappeared. Well, you couldn't even figure that one out of it. How could that be possible? Well, he was talking the other day about coming by here and just kind of walking by the studio and it was unlocked. Yeah. But he didn't come in. Yeah, he said that. Yeah. That was yesterday. But you would have to believe him wouldn't you? No. Where the hell is that? Well, I'll tell you what. I'll tell you what. It's that disappeared. I'm going to be, uh, apple-plucked. Mm-hmm. I think it's gone. Yeah, keep playing that in the background there because I can't find this card. I've got it's Neil or never. I've got that. But that's, um, where the hell could that have gone to? No idea. Do you have a special, like, a rack over there for always doing your own? Yeah. Yeah. We have a special rack for Don June. Yeah. Don June. Did you happen to listen to the show of Thanksgiving? I missed that. You did. Yeah. We're kind of busy with family, you know. I need to delete the bird. Yeah. Source-meek. Yeah. Stop the bird. You guys ran there together? Sorry. I missed that. Yeah. We were there together. It was interesting. Is that the word you want to use? Yeah. It was interesting. And another friend of Stan's was there. His friend is girlfriend. Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't say it. Yeah. Which one? Yeah. Which one? Trust me. Yeah. It's gone. So, um, Elvis Jr. Um, you ever seen my friend Corey James? Yeah. I've seen him quite often. I haven't seen him in the past month or so. But I've seen him up until the time I talked to you. I said, you know, I told you to say that. That he said, how do you? Good guy. I hear him on commercials and I see him on my cable TV. Yeah. He's doing eight. In fact, he did one of those live television spots a few weeks ago during one of the Saturday football games. Live. Yeah. The live spots from the Tammy Amidstree. They cut him off. They cut him short. Which was pretty interesting. I can't Dave saw it. He said they cut him short. Did they cut him off? At the end? Well, I didn't see it. I really didn't see every one of them. But the ones that I saw he did pretty good on. Well, that's good. Yeah, he did a good job. That is working. You cannot find that. Oh, God. I played a couple of times because I was so impressed. Remember I played a twice that one morning because it was really great. I said it's a good show. I did hear it. I did this. I'm telling you, it's not in here. You played it just the other day. I know. What's it saying? It says don't be cruel, Elvis. But you think it says. I don't know. I don't know. CCR? Yeah. Yeah. That's what I thought it was. Yeah. Peter, you idiot. I didn't catch him and said to say hi when I got in here. Oh, good. One of my favorite people. It's gone. I'm just looking. She dropped in here Thanksgiving day. I did cheer up. They're being incredible. What did she do to show right after you guys? Thanks. She told me that she loves to follow Neil. Whatever that means. Let's analyze that statement. What do you say? Yeah, let's not analyze it at all. Well, it's gone, Elvis. I was just, it's in the plan. But it's long gone. So you're going to have to talk to your buddy about what happened to it. Yeah. I'll bring it up with them. I definitely will sort of speak. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, what can I say? It's certainly exciting having Elvis here. We've got our jewelry sale coming up. Things really happen. What more could you want? Things are really happening. That's it before. What? Put more. Okay. Should we take it collar to here? Sure. Okay. By the way, we did lose somebody in Dave County. I stole the cart 620 3600. 620 3600. Dave County. Hello. Yeah. This is just track his press agent here. Yes, Jeff Jr. And he would like to know if he could play a song for him. He's kind of busy right now. He'd like to hear stroke me by Billy Squire. Real. How many would? And I'll be happy to have you. Jeff and Neil. Thanks a lot. Oh, yeah. Okay. Good luck to you. I think he's more than his agent. I'll tell you that right now. That was excellent. Yeah. I think he was calling from our doctor's office. You know which one I'm talking about, don't you? But what doctor would have not been to say it. Okay. Let's move on. Let's number two. He seems like just moments ago. We took number two. Since he put that painter's hand on an area. He's been as useless as he was on our frog. Trying to answer these hot folks. Oh, I know the phones are hot. That's because the Elvis Jr. He's hearing everybody. He made people think of Stan. And I'm sorry. Yeah. That's what we said. A brown county. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. It would have happened to your CD player. I had the same problem. Well, I took it into that place. On Griffin Road. Yeah. That place. And they said in a day or two, it's going to be just like new. They said they're going to fix it. Well, they didn't exactly tear it apart and show me all the, you know, what they were going to do. I have no idea. The beam needs to be adjusted. Uh. It's like this show. It's a little off beam. You're not going to give it away on the show. No, I don't think so. Yeah, the quality products like Stan, your buddy, Stan does like, what is it? Emerson. Yeah. And it feels like a CD. I like filtering. Yeah. If I get myself a new stereo, I'm definitely going to get a filter or maybe a key tell. Yeah. Go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. I had the same problem. All I did was shove the, you know, how when you press the button it goes in automatically. Yeah. You just shove the thing in by the hand one time and we're straight. Now, sir. You know, it's a quarter nine in a morning. It's not even close to those hours that the commission set aside for, you know, in discussions on a radio. I mean, this is, I don't want to probe too much to find out where you're coming from, but this is getting a little bit personal. I'll keep it clean. Okay. It van away. She makes more than 100,000. Yeah, I think about 120. Uh, least she's doing clothes and everything. Good job, Elvis. Okay. This is how it was going. Elvis, he'd be going to kind of spot. Uh, right. We're not going to hear him sing. Well, I'll have to play the other one. I have to play the one at the Mary-out, but I was hoping to play. Don't be cruel because it's, uh, as I said when we played it the other day, it sounds exactly like Elvis. Yeah. Do you have any venture of a guess of what might have happened to that card? Yeah. Think they Michael's got it. No, you're getting close though. Same studio, wrong times. What do you think is show? I think it's all right. Is show? Yeah. Yeah, it's. He's back there, so. Who cares? Oh, you tell him a J or stand. J. Oh, a Stampsia sucks. Oh boy, this is getting vicious. I like it. Yeah, I like it. Yeah, I'll be considering. It steals our Elvis card. It's getting good and vicious. Go ahead, sir. I don't know. I'm running out of material. Oh, that's it for him. Yeah, we are too. All right, you too, huh? Yeah. Get out of here, Doc. Okay, have a nice day, sir. But enough is enough. Okay, it's 849, 848 somewhere around there. It's almost newstime. And I don't know. These newscasts today have been pretty depressing. Pretty morbid. They're going to offer that Mary Elite toast stuff and a Cuban immigration deal. And all these other, there were a couple of other really morbid in the Wall Street. You know, track about that. No, that's depressing. We're on FM. Well, I've been trying. I'm happy news. You know, okay. Just pretend you're scottles your. I'm not. You're a happy simple. Now, I have to deal with what's available in the news. I asked you those plenty of happy news today. They're not as much. Oh, well, maybe if you'd brought the inquiremer back again today, we could have some happy news. Well, I do have the inquire, but we used most of it. Of course, that is my Bible. By the way, the national inquire, you know, it'll never lead you wrong. You're just going to continue to look for that card, right? Work it at B. Continue and continue. Continue and continue and continue looking over and over these things. You've already looked through these things. It's not here. I hear early. It's a 49. Good job, Barley. Maybe we get the current temp here. Right. That was loud and clear. Oh. You know, some people talk from like the depths of their lungs. Our lean talks from like the depths of her cheeks. That's why she's got such a bunch of voice. Okay. It's getting close enough to do the news now. And I apologize, and especially the Elvis, even though he's in production, I apologize that I cannot find that magnificent cut that he did because as usual, somebody came in here and got their fingers in the pot. Well, I think this decides that we locked the studio at 10 a.m. Yeah. And if God's gonna have to get his act together. He's been spoiled. He's used to this being just like his library. You know, he comes in here. He spins that carousel. You know what I'm saying? I have to get his stuff. He's got all kinds of room and a rack to certainly are no spots. Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster. Okay. That's the news intro because Elvis was in here. No, I forgot to put the news intro here. He's on like it anyway. You don't like that anyway. I hate it. You know, we don't have to use anything. Would you like that? Sure. Like ABC on some of their networks. Which one is a contemporary that they start cold? Yeah. Would you prefer that? We just go right into it. Okay. I'm going to know one. All right. I think about almost 20 million of America's 50 million smokers joined 1987. Great. American smoke out November 19th. 5.8 million were able to kick butts for 24 hours. The American Cancer Society made this announcement. A Gallup survey of over a thousand adults said 3.7 million were still not smoking one to three days later. Now, in keeping with our happy news here are the top movies in the country this week. Three men and a baby opened breaking one two and five day company records for Walt Disney. Now, over the five day Thanksgiving weekend, three men and a baby grossed nearly 14 million bucks. Another movie, Plains, Trains and automobile. John Hughes, new movie was number two, making over 10 million. Also in the top five Cinderella was number three. Fatal attraction stays in there. It's number four, making over 7.7 million over Thanksgiving. And Schwarzenegger's new movie, The Running Man, was number five. Mostly cloudy today, 40% chance of rain. High of 72, low to night 57, 66 degrees. It's at Zeta 4. It's 8.52. It's like I make these things up because I look for problems. I don't look for we have enough legitimate ones without creating new ones. Okay. Or imaginary ones. And he just doesn't want to. It's not like the, it's not a major. No, I take that back. It is a major problem. It's a small distance. Small distance. Okay. That's, it really makes you life worth wild. It just stays there. Every time you need something, just the appropriate number comes pop and write up. You bet. Date County. Hello. Yes sir. Are you doing today? Okay. Good. Welcome to the land of the lost. Well, I feel that way, you know. You want to buy some jewelry, sir. You want to buy? You want to buy? I would. You stink the entity. Oh yeah, listen, anybody wants to come in. We'll sneak them all in. All right. Listen, you know, I know you're pretty powerful man this now. Oh yeah. Got a lot of political swaying. I'm listening. It's really bugging me. I'm going to take a do something about it. Okay. I want you to get a bunch of guys. That sounds good. And hold the Tony's secret all down by off the land. Why is that? Why is everybody picking on Tony now? Why? Why? This is the guy who's like Mr. Pupp. Mr. Hatt. So what? His predictions in football are terrible. Of course we have a lot of money. Yeah, but he's a bit well, and you should know better. What do you think? Another word you said. I also have. You should look at his picks and take the opposite one. But I wish I had. I mean, I'd be weak or he goes to, you know, Bet Miami, Bet Miami, Bet Dharicane. So you can never cover, you know? Anyhow. I brought back a bullet one of those Michael Jackson, apply some notic things. Yeah. And I don't know. I don't know. I mean, how I use it on my cat on my board. It comes out looking like an issue. Yeah, that's a problem. You're right. You're going to see. No. I've heard that from several people in the home. I've heard that. Is an ongoing problem. Thank you. I was supposed to try it once. I was like, you and I stayed out. No, I tell you how to cure that. If you take it in, you drive about 30 miles real fat. Like an I 75 in a diesel truck. It'll change back. I'll try that. Now the driver of the truck has to be careful. You remember in the exercise in the closing scene, where he grabbed a hold of Linda Blair and beat the crap out of her, and he took the evil spirit into him? Yes. That's what happened. All right. Well, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Ladies and gentlemen, nine o'clock right on the nose. And here he comes in his $90,000 BMW. Is that him? Is that your? Oh, boy. Talk about bird brain, sir. Yeah. Oh, yes. Yes. The folks are question-brain. Go ahead. Hi, Glenn. Hi. You, you, sir. I could lose out of the system. Oh, yeah. I like it. I'm just kind of wondering if I can see the movie that ten times. Uh, what? Yeah, not- nothing- say what was your doubt, but like, what time period was it supposed to represent? Uh, today. It took- it took place- You know, we know that. Towards the end of the movie. I mean, the beginning of the movie. You think you're in the 50s, right? Yeah, but what difference does it make? I mean, you have no thing of reference, you know. Yeah. Yeah, that's the way David Lynch likes it. He does- he doesn't want you to have a frame of reference. I see. It's part of the whole mood of the movie. Now, did you ultimately like the movie? Very much. Yeah, me too. It's, uh, you know, I just hope to have some- I'm a random zombie. I got hooked on that royal- Oh, listen, song- uh, in dreams? Uh-huh. That's- that great performance by, uh, being stuck-wellers, un-toweled and cinematography. It's true. It is. It's a great performance. You know, somebody understood the idea. Oh, it's a perfect rap. Yeah. The guy's rap, and, uh, having a buck. He's like, they're doing a Harvard job. Uh, he talked it up. Yeah. That was a good job. Um. Okay, so long. Well, I see he said goodbye. And, uh, not too soon. Now, but that was good. He understood the movie. Okay, do you want to check this out after the ID? I think we could have just made radio history. Oh, okay. As he mentioned, Roy Orbison. Hmm. Just the only- like, fit all the pieces together. Well, that's the only music you know. As you remember that bang, uh, what was your name? Patty Murray. Patty Murray. Very good memory. Yeah. Remember you're like a hawk. The only- and he's face to face. And all I know is that Roy Orbison, all of us aging- Jucks. That's right. Okay, let's do the ID and make it legal. And then, uh, we'll see what happened with that car. She wore- Oh. Yes, good day, Pat Bowen. Today Bobby Vitton meant tomorrow on Eonette footage show. Mommy. Don't look at me. Don't worry, I'm looking- Oh, don't keep saying that. First, keep listening to the radio. WCTA. Miami Beach. Ford Lada del. In the Palm Beach. Is that a four? Mommy. He can't hear me. That can salt man. I'll tell you, see, losing it or what? That was Chris Gable. I bet most of the people in Eonette didn't recognize the voice from the little boy IDs, but he has these split personality. You know, he's like 20 different personalities. So like one of them is- Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster. I was not the same guy. Mm-hmm. But tell this Harrison one. Uh-uh. Want to see doing looking for a job up here? Boy, shame on you. This is what's got- 903 on Zeta 4. So let this loose. Okay, and see if it was good. Great. If it was good for us. Mm-hmm. Pretty warm. Ah. Walking down the street. Now that. Would you win- We just made radio history. I would even impress Ricky Tiki. Uh, impress. Mm-hmm. No, would depressing because there's no way in the world he could match that. That sounds like you're on his slickest day. Yeah, you're competing against the master of talk-ups. It sounds like to me. Yeah. You're trying to show him up. The master of mong. That's right. Yeah. And you're doing a hell of a job, too. Yeah, we've outdone him at his own game. What is he going to do now? Mm-hmm. Oops. I'm sorry, wait a minute. That's okay. We don't mind hearing your watch bleep-in. In fact, I'm going to set mine for like the middle of the show. Ah. I just thought- Good be day goes off at a different time. We don't have time for you to set your watch. I just created a- Hopefully. Don't have time. Oh, well. For you to adjust your time. As a matter of fact, I got a good idea. Why don't you just ditch that one? Because on the 11th of December and just 10 days, Tony Prado has got this hot jewelry coming in here from the flea market. A red-ed memo, Ron. I read that on the ear. That is one of the most embarrassing Memos in the history of the broadcast industry. Sure to go down in the anals of broadcasting. Wait a minute. Who's that? Michael Mendes? Yeah. He used to work here. Tony is here too. Oh, that's great. I wonder what she's selling today. What are they peddling in Tony's office today? the question ladies and gentlemen. Watch all the call in the business office right now now do we know what the numbers are here we've been on for eight weeks I have no idea the business number but the business number is a blue let's

early because he knows we keep given the time on the air and then he makes it look good now this the song you wanted to play by Chicago beginnings yeah it might be a lot I was going to say it might be a good idea to wait like about 30 minutes from now and pull away at the end of the show what is it about eight minutes oh oh that's the unedited that's the whole thing that's a great record y'all it's phenomenal yeah that's from their first album isn't it?

magnificent job if we do it better isn't it sounds like that I thought that they had read down the jingle which there's no way in the world this outfit would pay for that can you believe he'd like this captain Dave I didn't say I liked it at all I said he did a good job of redoing that I'm putting it together it is pretty smooth I must say myself well those are the same people singing on that that did this that Pete gave me yesterday okay all right let's go to a Broward County and get back with just loads of these great calls from all these people and the thing I like about the colors today they know they're getting nothing okay I like that too those are the kind of listeners we want not these FM free loaders Broward County hello hello Neo yes sir that's not just this close to being completely psychotic oh really if you have one of those impossible dreams sir yes I heard you're the greatest touch that's right well anyway when I have one with I took my kitty that's hitting the plastic I've got 1000 and you'll never dreamt of going near to it like like he sounds like the guy on this he's not a jam who that yeah major it was so horrible my captain yeah well it sounds like you've had an emotional experience over at havn't you that's fairly new I you know who was on MTV this week on besides Howard Stern who's that divine yeah I heard about that I didn't see I missed you like like yeah yeah he's seen he I've seen him on David Letterman all right he's enormous yeah I was gonna say if he did notice me he's a good analogy but you might have oh okay well the go ahead I can handle it I see look like you in drag oh he's these a lot bigger than I am a lot yeah well in fact one day this week I'm coming in drag just for the hell of it okay I am you know YouTube concert you just like totally hate them no I don't I don't hate them at all in fact you know it's really amazing to me I brought in this is before anybody was even talking about the concert weeks ago I brought in my very own Joshua tree CD that I bought from the Columbia CD club and I gave it away on the air right remember that that was that was back on a m that's meant that's many moons ago okay before anybody even knew they were coming here and now why would I buy that if I didn't like you I need you so I don't know what he is disgusting but I like he's pretty good but I like the music yeah you got it yeah okay you're going to the concert right yeah okay I hope you enjoyed how to get back YouTube YouTube YouTube well Elvis Jr is back from another pressing in Adrian there he is are you going to the me two concert oh no I'm not going to me two or you two Elvis one of the oh two I was at red so how does this spot come on a slice of pizza splites come on come on Elvis you like I can match no well nobody can well did you hear the story about what happened to our cart oh yeah we got a call about it certainly might yeah somebody played Saturday it was playing it back and forth with the original and doing this big comparison thing in a course as usual I didn't bother to bring it back to where it was nesting originally which means he probably took it out of here Saturday yeah wouldn't you say well yeah and Peter Borger keeps insisting orders nobody been in that room it's locked I guess stamp his a lot of money for those locksmiths he really does he he would do that too you're joking but he would do it he's desperate enough yeah when you're as dry of material as he is when the well has run dry man you'll be just hanging around this studio about 130 in the afternoon yeah that's a thought now he could just like he could hide in the atrack room there and he could just like pier over the top of the window and as he sees somebody skulking down the hall and wandering in here and rifling through these carts can there be any question okay so I guess what we'll do is we'll do uh it's needle or never because we gotta do something in honor of his big heart and this is great okay not as good as don't be cruel though I don't think I did it that well because uh well I wrote that copy right before I went on stage I'd like and uh I used one of my dad's songs Viget I wasn't quite ready for in other words he's rolling in his grave is that what you saying I believe he's always gonna rock and roll you know he's rocking and rolling in his grave okay in fact we might even play Grace Lane too my Paul Simon we really get the unlikely we can get carried away the more unusual there's a I You money you say But won't get to the end. All who knows when you look at my rear end. That way, it should be in the morning. It's a full night. It's got to the bed away, man. It seems such a bright day. The morning will always be the same. All in a ragin' old hornet bay. It's a new morning. It's up in the light. It's got to the bed away, man. It seems such a bright day. The morning will always be the same. All in a ragin' old hornet bay. All in a ragin' old hornet bay. It's a new morning. It's a new morning. I'll be holding it. There he is. That's great. You're very modest about that. I got to tell you the night that I was there. It's like they weren't there. They were lost. They were following Jay's lead. You have her to show, right? The new name for the last one. He's a good guy. How do you like these? I've worked with these before. They're fantastic. You're favorite. Well, let's just pretend we play. I'm going to fix him. He gave me the key to his apartment because he said if something ever happens to him, you know him. I'm going to go up in there. I'm going to take every tape and every cassette and every video tape the man has got that. soldier. Oh yeah, whatever. I don't think I take that. I don't ever like sure. What is it? Uh, that's how many hours I spent doubling that thing? That's like some stupid PBS BBC. Oh, I didn't even watch like 18 episodes and missed the last one. He taped them and it's like 18 hour episodes and the last 20 minutes was missing. Betty told the story. I'm a grown man to be watching. Betty, you know? And Betty comes to town four years later and he comes up to her all excited and he goes, guess what I got Betty? The last 20 minutes. I don't want to touch them. I bet that's what he said. He did. And you know what it turned out? She was interested at the end of the week. All that talking to not in the least bit interested. But I can't see that I blame her. Okay, 24 10 on J to four. Let's take couple of calls and then we're going to play a long record and go home and it's the fact that I don't think we'll even do the last newscast. Do you? It's up to you. No, I don't. Stan tells me that you leave like at nine, 57. You're out of the building and it's going to be earlier than that. Is that your limo right outside? And you know what else? We only work five days on this show. We don't work on Saturday. You know, he mentions that a lot. Everyone wants to know why. And like on Friday at nine, 55. See, we got all arrested the day off Friday. All day Saturday. That's a tough one. And all day Sunday. So it's almost like a three hour three day weekend. You know, you live a life much like my daddy used to have. Yeah, yeah. I do spend a lot of time in the gym. When you work for this company, man, you never you never go too far from the nearest job. Just don't bring any read material in there. I know. I try to avoid it. I remember that I learned my lesson well. Okay, well, we don't take a call from if we're going to split early. We got to do the spots now. Hmm. Yeah, you know, is there any special? Now, you see the problem. The problem with that is you're assuming that the break has to be at 40 is at it because we have 19 minutes to go. Now, 8 in 3. My arithmetic could be a little bit off. That sounds like 11 minutes to me. Okay. In other words, let me just ask you this question. Do I have trouble getting out of here at 10 o'clock? Are we usually within 30 seconds a minute? One way or the other. The other the show. Am I correct? I was under the assumption that we either had to take it around 35 or 50. But in other words, is that the law? In addition to the 8 minutes. In other words, you don't want us to get chewed out of the meeting today if we don't take the break. It won't be a time. I said, I don't know. What do you mean you're not going to be there? I told you, I've got to do this. This is an important meeting about the U2 concert. And pull out this of something really. Go ahead, man. All up. You wait. Pull out. Don't you know there's a penalty for early withdrawal? What is this man talking about? I don't know. I don't want this. It is not between midnight and 6 in the morning. Okay. Now we did come on in a minute to 6 this morning. And you used some vulgar language. Which is totally unrelated to my show. It was before that it was before the idea I was talking about the Christmas tree. Whatever the hell it was. It had nothing to do with this show. It was still part of the Peter Moon show. It was part of the midnight to 6 block. You bet. Okay. Maybe he should try to rhythm method. Yeah. I think that might help. So you're going to get out 11 minutes before the top of the hour because we'll have three spots. And then. No. No. What we'll do is we'll do the spots now. Like I was. Which I know is a shocking because it actually covers like parts of two quarter hours, which the consultants will not. They will not be able to handle that. Okay. And you understand what I'm saying. In other words, we might lose credit for both quarter hours. Now there's no logic in that because nobody's going anywhere. Right? The phones are solid. Everything's been great. But we're taking a break at the wrong time. That's right. So we'll probably get chastised for that by Peter Bulgley. Notice he's got his suspenders on today. Because we have this big meeting. Many days during the week lately, I've noticed no suspenders. But during the days when we have meetings, suspenders. He's got to have something to hold on to. Yeah. Well, that's about all he's got. That's the popular rumor and plantation. I'll tell you that. Okay. Let's take the break. And now we come back. We can chat with Elvis Jr. We can take a caller to and then without any pressure any of your hysteria, then we can do it. Hey, this is Dave. Okay. Here we go. And I don't need to. We have Elvis Jr. We have a surprise celebrity standing by. Hello. Hey, down. How you doing, pal? All right. No changes. What's up, buddy? How are you? You're up pretty early this morning. I'm in a, I'm hurting. I hurt. Are you calling from from the Ferrari? No, man. I'm at home. I want to walk before you know, out listening to you on the balcony. Oh, are you locked out? Yeah, man. I just, you know, it's digging the cool air. You know, I mean, it's my right. Yeah. Listen, man. I got a question for Glenn. Yes, sir. You had a picture of a more beautiful guy. Oh, my gosh. You know, that was sin in, uh, Don Jr. That was sin in by a listener. Isn't that interesting? I mean, I got an hour number. Do you? I know she's up to no good, man. Is that anonymous? Was that anonymous? Yeah. We're sitting in anonymously, Don Jr. Do you mean, uh, he knows she's up to no good. And he wants to be in on had. Is that what you're saying? That's it, that's it. I see. I understand. You got this, that you got this thing for young blinds. It sounds like I got this thing. We're anything. Look at that. In other words, you want to say, oh, God, that's no good. Is it? You're trying to say, Don? Hey, hey, hey, hey, that's it, man. It sounds really good. Well, I guess, thank you very much. Are we going to get together and jam? Oh, uh, I just still playing down at that club in the beautiful downtown, uh, how on day on area? Yeah, I am. That's the button south. I'm surprised Neil has some stop by there because he hangs out and how on the other side. They like me a lot there. So he rose and birds throwing a big bash for me there next week. Big bang. Yeah, the big bang. Yeah, the big bang. Yeah, they were hot, man. Did you get together with your, uh, keyboard player and, uh, yeah, we're doing that this weekend, but uh, you're, man, I'm serious. I got, I got laid up my arms on messed up. Yeah, what? I got laid up. I'm laid down, but laid up. You know, me? What happened? I'm so we had to cancel that night. Is that right? That was the right, but you know, what can I do? Well, yeah, buddy. Yeah, buddy. I get in touch with you, all right. You got it, buddy. You can have a dungeon. You can have those pictures if that will do any good at all. Is that a promise? You got it. I'll bring it down. That'll help. That'll only nice. Can you know what I mean? No problem, Don, Jr. You guys have a great, uh, take a look. Okay, Don, see you later. Okay. He's just like his daddy. He's been a lot of those lonely nights. Yeah. Yeah. Stale come by and keep warm. No question about that. It's, uh, 12. Probably it's before 10. And we could take a call or two here and just, uh, you know, do we got your cargo standing by with that eight minute cut? Also, we do have a couple of minutes. Oh, what kind of you're doing from Chicago? Beginning. You can relate to that. Of course. I like it's now or never. It's kind of like the same. I also had the one that you played during the Ironic Contra here. It was at one conversations or dialogue. I was like, something like that's a great song. Yeah, it is. That's one of the first ones, wouldn't it? He never knew that. What was about, uh, 69. Well, I wanted it.
