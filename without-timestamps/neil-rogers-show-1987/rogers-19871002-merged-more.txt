to the show and out of time, rower, I beg your pardon. Hello, it's Neil, please, all right, is it cow? No, this is Neil. Oh, Neil. We're just picking them right up today, sir. We're just jumping right into the phone. Very good, Neil. This is John from on a coral spring. Yeah, John. Neil, I know you're not hurting for this, but I'd like to pledge my two hours to the show. You're, oh, yeah, let's take pledges for quarter hour, okay? Let's take pledges for all the people we have been doing. Yeah, our Joey thought. Yeah. Only you have to be calling from Cheek to Ogan in York, sir. Is Glenn over there? Yeah, he's here. Glenn, I'd like to give a thumbs up to Lou Velvet. All right. And mine, me, and can you take on a new one? Yes, sir. Just strike and come to the carol city. Yeah. Yeah, Lou Velvet's on this weekend also. Really? I'd tell you, this is going to be a big month for movies on people's, you notice that? Yeah, why is that? New fall season, I love. I don't know. Have you noticed that? Yeah. I've got this weekend over there. It's true. Yeah, stand by me and bigger than life. What's stand by day? Yeah, all the heavies are coming this way. Dave doing a table top tonight. Yep. It's hopeful. Neil, I'll be out there and I'll look forward to it. Okay. Keep your hands off Dave now. Yeah, Dave. I'll read the urge. What for three? Hike. Ha ha ha ha. It was a Puerto Scams. I don't know about you, but my life is progressing here without the football amazing. That is amazing. Biggest investment ball game of the weekend. It hurricanes at the FSU up until I heard stand by the way, say something really dumb the other day, which is not unusual. Our stand, our stand. He said that the FSU was going to destroy the hurricane. I mean, that's so ridiculous. That's ludicrous. And I don't happen to be a big hurricane of football fan. I like hurricane baseball. Football, Jimmy Johnson's not one of my favorite people. And I just never gotten crazy about him. This is a game going to be closed or is it? No. Hurricane or destroy them? Okay. I'm telling you, it's a game here. Tunger brains at knowledge and telehancing. Okay. On TV, probably. Probably. I'll be watching every minute of it. I'm going to be watching cable. And then you'll be watching the braves. Oh, yeah. Anyway, we got all these great movies coming up. Stand by me, blue velvet. I'm probably going to miss a braves game. My fall to the odd father. Yeah, all these movies. Oh, the godfather. Yeah. Oh, that's on all month long. Part one to even parts that haven't been filmed yet. I'm just obsessed. Anyway, that's one of the things we wanted to talk about. I got sidetracked before. Are there other people out there who are obsessed with either movies or TV shows? Do you think? Sure. Well, I mean, oh, and also not slanting was our last thing. I'm not too exciting. No, it was not. The Pat Petersen wasn't out. It was just. Yeah. Pretty depressing. I agree. And this year, by the way, they're not shooting Donomills to Illinois. No, it's to a brick wall. It was phenomenal. You never looked better. OK, Jeff Bray is here. And he's going to, I'm sure, get through these headlines with no problem at all. And we go to a CBS for the world news at the top of the hour. Mine is Liberty Mutual. And they may block or if there are a tapes in the mail. OK, I want to thank our WI and G. engineering staff. But only took two of them to get the little pot back on its thing here. You know what I'm saying? Are you following or you're going to get the lost in your mail again now? Well, I see the way you operate around mail call. This note from Joe. Oh, you're Joe? She's been to pictures today. Yeah, and this note, she gave me. Let me see it. Is it personal? No. It's really nice. There's Weedy Bird. Yes. Well, that's a good name. That's why we hadn't thought of Sweedy Bird. That's the best way I could describe you. I just wanted to tell you that since I met you, something strange has been happening to me. You must be contagious. Well, she's got that far right. Yeah. She's where ornaphological diseases. She's OK. That's what's worth is ornaphological. Close. Could be. But anyway, Jill certainly made my day now. Jill's probably in school, so she can't hear the show today. And probably so is everybody else in her. Oh, and then these are all teeny boppers. I beg your pardon. You heard me. Shame on you. And there are pictures of these people at the ice cream store. There are all kinds of pictures of Brian here. Remember him? Remember who used to talk about him? Yeah. Brian and a lady who asked me to take a picture and show to stand. If you're listening to any audience, you can just look in the little speaker in your radio. Brian making a milkshake is an acute. What's written on the back? Little, it says, Brian and the process of making a milkshake. I'm reading them, OK? Sorry. Mr. Nose Beak. Just. Here is Rob and a friend. Rob from Windixie. Here's Rob from Windixie again. Ooh. And here's, uh, here's the young man. She says, looks like Jason Gedrick. Do you think he looks like Jason Gedrick? Exactly. Big. Isn't nice guy. Here's Jason Gedrick with a friend. Look what they're doing. You know, yeah. You know, these kids today. Oh my god. Look at this picture here. This must be, um, that must be Marcie and Jamie. God. And there's, uh, there's Joe with her brother Jason. That is Joe. Yeah. Just hands off of my picture. Look at it. I like it. Josh. And that Brian boy just keeps coming back. The famous Brian and there's Brian Josh and Josh's best friend. There they are. And they all look a lot happier and lots, uh, more pleasant. These pictures than they did on Monday. But that's where I could. You know what I'm saying? That's the way it goes. And where is that little note that I had? Here it is. And I don't believe this. Is this, is this for real? Neal. Keep shopping at Windixie and keep, keep up your show. Rob. Is that for real? Well, it's everything spelled correctly. He's some people now. Didn't I try to explain this the other day? Some people have a good sense of humor. Am I right? And some people just don't get it. And some people can get up like a little bit of attention. And then there are other people to get all surly. They probably listen to Joey Reynolds, you know. And I get all been out of shape. There's a nice note in here from Joe. And the thank you, Joe. Yeah. Great. Great pictures too, by the way. Yes. Doesn't it look like a mirror? I like that. I wouldn't go that far. I think she's a knockout. And then we have something here that's shaking. I wonder if this is as good as the Santa that came in here. Now, what are you doing? What are you doing? Did you see that? Did you see him reach over and pick up my letter from Joe? I love her handwriting. Good. See it? Good. My own personal note. The noziest beat you asked by those. I've heard them. Now, did I give you my note and let you read nothing in your note? There's a lot of personal things in there from Joe. She and I got a little thing going. Yeah, right. Good luck to you. You never know. It's never too late to change your ways. If that would please Joe, if that would make him happy. There's an issue. We have this morning. We got that dictionary puzzle. And now we have the rotary nose clipper. All kinds of cute little stuff. It's tough in the mail today. And remember I talked to the day about arsenic in Olaise. Well, it didn't send the old lace, but somebody did send a little jar or something else. The read helping hand the fragrance of love. What they wrote on the label. Wait a minute. Okay. What did they write on the label? Just read it. It's good. Can you read it from there? No. It just, well, yeah, I can tell you what it says. It says forward to Neil Rogers. Glenn Hill, keep your hands off. You go. You pervert. Listen, anybody in this audience wants to send anything to me. You should write on the envelope or the package or whatever. Bird hands off. That's what it says. You pervert. Here's a little bottle. It says helping hand the fragrance of love. Hmm. What is that smell? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Boy, it works fast, too, doesn't it? So we thank all the people for sending this mountainous crap in here today, huh? Boy, this has been quite an out enough. What? Crap. Dave County, hello. Good stir. What? Dude stir. Yeah, this is dude stir. Hey, listen. Are you all pretty good times with Hank Oldberg? Yeah, thanks a good guy. Is it pretty good guy, right? Even if he can't give him, you know, an objective opinion because he works for a bunch of douche bags. Exactly. But I'm listening to Mr. Ego. Stop and program. Yeah. Last thing you go, bird. Spread of ability and stopping and we're all, but if we're tired of getting away with that. Yeah, I heard one rip yesterday. I mean, he was disgusting. There was a station put up with an amateur and whistle like him. No, he's a professional in the solar system. Hey, I caught up to the CNN and diversifying everything. He invited himself on crossfire tonight. Oh, good. Yeah, he's on crossfire a lot, you know. If he's gone, he's got to get his ego fixed. I just wanted to know what, you know, go over. How's he going? I'm going away with this. I don't know why. He's pretty good. They should guy. He knows small potatoes when he sees it. All right. Well, I just wanted to get your opinion on it. Don't worry about Hank. Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll leave it there. Dude, sir. That's not just like, um, what's his name? My Anthony. Look at this male to the amtony. It's just one of the wildest days and it's all great stuff. I never heard the radio Rogers to lie, I've done Harbor Island two weeks ago. This is Bob, a 49 year old grandfather. Chicago raised. The bears, loves the bears. Look at this. Look at the writing. Just a great letter. Little pictures. Anyway, we're just reading the mail. So if you hear a lot of dead air, don't worry about it. Okay. We're still here. We're okay. And somebody I know has got his thing all over the phone. Have you noticed? Who is that? Is that anybody we know? Scott Lizzieher. Good morning. When you're playing germs on our windows, we have news people who have to work in that studio. He's got his ass stuck on the window in there. And he amazing part of it is, well, I don't want to tell you audience. It would be embarrassing. It's like, oh, nothing there. It's like smooth. I have never seen anything so embarrassing. And all my love. Look like he just came from the Michael J. Fox fan club. All smooth on the other side of that fan club. What was that supposed to mean? I have no idea. Do you know what? No, I don't want to. I mean, you know what? You know, they're getting openly hostile. Yeah. We went up there to cut a couple of spots in FM production in one of their 82 productions studios this morning. And boy, they are really turning. They take some days to recover. Well, just wait. Okay. Let's go on to Broward. Hello. Harry, I put my eats, mossy. I'm going forward. Oh, no, you're not Jamie. Did you forget what night this is? No way, mossy. No way. It's your mother and those two evil stepsisters coming over here tonight. No, no. It's feel for me, John, like with our idols. Stan, major in Neil Roger. Oh, no, you know, I am not sitting here while Stan majors on dresses you with his Learen and Jiren and that Neil Roger seats a set of housing. Jamie, I mean, so much to me, my sister. Alright, alright, just this once. Hey, what happened to my bowling money? Oh, oh, that. Well, I forgot to tell you. The only way I can get them to come over was to bribe their agent. The bird. What? What diamond? Yeah, just a lovely road chain with his name and grayed on it. Hey. Well, Stan and Neil really dinner over the evil home of Marcy and Jamie. The last known personality to eat there was Lee Fowler. And he was never heard from again. There he is. Hey, baby. Yada, greatest. Mama, mama, don't told me. Stay away from those bird brains. He's probably an under there. He was back in FM. Page him doing a sequel to this. Really? Yeah. He'll tell you it's a take off of the hunting minors. When he started to cut it yesterday, he came to me and he says, I'm going to do a spoof of the hunting minors on this Jamie and Marcy thing. That's the hunting minors theme that they're getting through the whole thing. Wrong. That's not the hunting minors thing. Yes, it is. That the hunting minors theme? Yes, see. Yeah. Alright, Leonard says it is. Carl is apoplectic says it's not. It's certainly not psycho. Jeez. You guys. We have a major contratomps in the studio, ladies and gentlemen. Page Jay Michaels. He's my one who's not in. What's one of the colors getting on the charts is Mal. Hello. Okay. There's a good. Hello. Good morning. Yes, sir. Where is Fondigabatican? Yeah. Hi, son. Get out of here, sir. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. I'm Apple again. For the deep folks with the answer. Yes, sir. That the scene is on that is the hunting minors opening scene. The real name is called My Greatest Love written by Jack Eccleason. The Fondigabatican was called Moonlight Snownade, which was used on his TV show. Okay. Absolutely correct. Yeah. How would I say it? I think it's a strange round of one. 90 seconds to get on my material. Okay. Go ahead. 88. 87. Go ahead. I'm going to go in. No, no, no, no. I'm counting on you. You're going to go in and moving. Fuck. Yeah. I want you to try to get a strike or special that you'll promise on. Jay said it's honey mooners. It is. So I guess that's what it is. I guess we owe somebody a deep apology. I would agree with that. Here's my foot. Let's see how deep he's going to follow. Hello. Are you there? Go ahead. We have a time call. 42. 40. I understand you get a nine share. Hello. Go ahead. You can sit in training for days. Yeah. I heard from my sources that a mystery Glenn Hill retain the services that infamous or an ecological attorney, Ellis Robbins. Okay. Hey, it seems the Autobahn society places BC. Glenn. All right. We don't. Let's not get in any of these. Legalese. Okay. We have our reasons. But let's not get in any of that. Okay. I just want to go in. Okay. Very touchy and sensitive here today. Have a wonderful life. Okay. The W only has to be given an illegal idea to top of the hour. The rest of the hour. You think I don't know that? Of course you think I'm a total douchebag. I'll let you been in this business. This is a board meal. Well, Mark Griffin. Oh yeah. You would happen to handle it. Exile to a station. It's not even on the air. Yeah. Channel six. It's single ghost right up in the air. Even a cable you can't catch in. It's a barbeque. The whole piece. So anyway, their call letters are WWNN. Right. But they say you're listening. But that's wrong. What's wrong? It's quoting here. It says you're listening to WNN. The announcer says broadcasting the call letters of Joe Knuckles Grant experiment in Pompattle Beach. The world's first all motivation radio state. What's wrong with that? They don't give the first W. Correct. The first what? The first W. The first W. Is that what you're talking about? We've just discovered a quadril bird has a quadril. You endudonald would work real well to get out of that letter. Rub your quadril together. You get out of that letter right before X and the alphabet. They don't give the first one. Is that what you're talking about? Is that what you're, yes. What's wrong with that? There's a station in Pompatle. They call it KGR. It's WKGR. They only give the full call letters at the top. The hour. No, I must be on the west coast. Pompas Springs. Maybe KGR. No. It's in Pompatle. It's Springs. Yeah. There's nothing wrong with that. So, in short hand now, right? We were INZ. She's in short hand. Ninety-one. INZ. Ninety-four. INZ. That's okay. Yeah. I don't like that. I just did. Okay. See if there was any other letter. But when there's another W. They got plenty of them in the call. They can do that one. Yeah. Yeah. motivational radio. That's probably the VELRAGY respecters. What the, ah. I'm going to do that. Absolutely. The VELRAGY respecters. Now we got to it. Okay. Take a minute. Okay. Let's go back to some cars. Okay. Let's go to Broward. Hello. Hi. Hello. What's up? What's this Jeff Gray look like? Who? Jeff Gray. Jeff Gray. Jeff Gray. You don't know who Jeff Gray is. He works for you. No, how about you? Sir. Slow down a little bit. How about Jeff Gray with a B? B as in Boyish. Oh really? G as in Boyish. No, I thought it was, uh, G. I guess I didn't hear it. I'm sorry. Well, you know, when you're laughing at much, it's hard to predict the name. You know, got a sexy voice. Jeff Gray has a sexy voice. I thought so. What is it? What do you look like? Forget it, sir. Really? He's a nice guy. Very nice guy, but he's not your type. Oh, really? What are we doing now? We're going to start like the counterpart of the Aliin Ross voice obsession. For desperate queens, is that what we're doing now? Come on now. Come on. You can do better than that. I watched a channel seven news this morning and they had Pat Robertson reply to all the techers yesterday. Yeah. He said apparently he wasn't worried about it because apparently they were just a bunch of untouchery out of American. Yeah. Probably a bunch of the militant black homo 7. Yeah. I was reading an magazine where he says that he gets elected, which is a joke, but if he gets elected, I got news for it. It's not a joke. I mean, the teaching elected very apart. There are going to be a lot of us who are going to be swimming over to Cuba or somewhere anywhere. Anywhere we can get to. He says that he gets elected, has kind of going to be made up of nothing but born of Christians because they're the only ones that are morally capable of running this country. Yeah. And he was holding up his clouse Barbie doll while he was cutting his feet. Yeah. Who's this E-class law? I just got this junk mail on my mail box. He's your representative sir. He's your congressman from Broward County. So I just moved in to the new. And God help you, sir. I would move out right now. No, he just said we did litter about AIDS. He says President Reagan has announced that our nation needs an all-out campaign to stop AIDS. I agree completely. That's kind of a joke too. Yeah. I don't know what you're upset about. The president is a budget of $80 this year. What I'm upset about. I don't know what you're upset about. I don't know what you're upset about. I don't know what you're upset about. I don't know what you're upset about. I don't know what you're upset about. No, 80. They had all cutbacks. You don't know. What's the hit show about? I listen. Now you would love the hit show. I'm telling you for many reasons, but I can just tell by the general pattern of your. Well, I heard you talk about it. If you're a listed dialogue, I can tell. You know who Tom Hollis. Yeah. Oh, listen to the enthusiasm there, right? And what's your hour? And what's your hour? I saw like the first 15 minutes of the hit show. I saw a record hour in this. And why did you turn it off? Because I thought that's sweet. I was tired. I got home from work. Don't you have a VCR? Yeah. But I didn't pay. Doesn't everybody in American have a VCR? You have a year like my roommate. You know, you sit down. You want to move your news. I don't like to pay something. I think it's the first time. Can I ask you question why I know that probably your house is being watched. But you get like coming from magazines like TV guide. Right. You know, or the cable guide? I mean, you know, one of those, does it look at your mailbox every once in a while? It's both in a while. So like if you see that it's coming. I mean, the hit show is on like every night practically because it's a popular. It's like a, it's got a cult following. Yeah. And just see what it's coming on and tape it. I'm telling you, you'll love the hit show. It's just great. The last part where I thought was he was on this cute hit to say I want to die and the hit to steam out of the car. What do you mean this cute. That's Tom Howell. I know. Do you look at everything in terms of, I mean, you know, body parts and sex and the like I do. I mean, I don't know. She must have shame on you. It's up to the godfather. I watched that last night. That wasn't too. Okay. Now there was nobody sexy in the godfather. But I don't you know, but I don't you become obsessed with that movie. Oh, yeah. I've seen all I've seen it probably 50 times. And I still can't get enough. I think God's not a two-time tonight. Yeah. Yeah. But that's without Marlon Brand. We'll feel the night talk. Trust me. Watch the hit you will. Okay. And when you see it, let me know how you like it. Okay. I'll read for there. Okay. Two, four, six, eight. A little hell. Who do we appreciate? He doesn't need a little help. He just needs a little encouragement. Yeah. A little guidance. Right. Like TV guidance. Good start. Twenty-two before lunch at WI and Z lunch is coming in at noon or thereabouts being brought to us tonight. Some Italian recipes. You believe that guy I'm still burning over that guy who said, you know, what do your favorite restaurants when you pay? Yeah. I think he's confusing me with an egotistical moron who's on in the afternoon on another station. Obviously. Mr. Parmese. They'd count. Hello. Yes. Okay. You know who that is, don't you? I sure do. Hello. I think I know what that music is. It's a cross between my sweet Lauren and she's so fun. Exactly. This year, Fons. I would recognize them anywhere. Wait a minute. One more time. Oh, yeah. No question about it. For Paris and Swiping the Honeymooners News. No. I think it was one of the fine day about this year. That was their other one. Well, I'm sorry. Right? Yeah. One, three, twelve, fourteen. I'll read for there. Okay. By the way, Joey's going to be doing an anti-Semitic jokes Monday morning. So, those of you who enjoy that kind of bigotry. I'm sure you love it. Covered in this town real well. Yeah. I come to name Joe Robby Stadium after Joe. I don't know. I'm going to have to ask somebody that, let's ask Don Shula. Do you remember Don Shula? Well, I don't know if Joey does, but I do. Do you? And Danny Moreno. I must confess one thing. I shouldn't admit this. But I'm kind of curious. I may even watch more football this weekend. Then I would have watched. If it were to be no strike. Because I'm curious is what it's going to look like. You know what I'm saying? I look like a renaffootball. I think Carl has an immediate. The US. The US. US. USless football. Yeah. So like a renaffootball. Yeah. All that same level. Yeah. And Steve. Well, Steve Young could have crossed the picket line. I like that Tony Durse. Man, he's only making like what? 40 million a year. And he just can never, you know, get those bills paid. You know what I'm saying? It's tough. He never catch up. So he followed Danny White right across that picket line. Of course, there were a lot of us who would have followed Danny White across there too. But not lately. He's he's looking bad. I'm telling you. He's with the very short life, Danny White. He looks beaten and brutalized and just horrendous. Sort of like me. Yeah. Very very close. Not that horrendous. Yeah. They've got a hello. Okay. Let's try another one in date. Hello. Hi. Hi. I was just calling to make a comment about what you said about swimming Kikuba. Oh yeah. Just a joke now. Don't get all up tight. Yeah. I'm going to get up tight. How about the Bahamas? Should I sit swimming to the Bahamas? No. I'm sincerely thinking about if Mr. Ward is nominated or any of those other jerks get in toss if I'm sincerely going over to be a passport place and getting myself a passport. Oh yeah. I've been suggesting that for a long time. If I went Reagan got elected the first time I said you better. I'm getting the heck out of here. You better have a passport and keep it warm. Keep it in the microwave. Definitely. Definitely. It will be that. So I'll stick around for a little while. I think pork is a dark now. You know he's finished. He's dead as a door nail. I can't leave him. That's good. I always liked Arlan's specter. I know he was creative when he came up with a single bullet theory and the Kennedy assassination. And I knew he had a wild imagination. So, you know, he's been useful. Yeah. Yeah. Well. Don't sweat it. I will try not. Soon as Pat Robertson becomes president and I think wouldn't be great if we got down to a choice between Pat Robertson and Jesse Jackson. Oh my goodness. The ultimate. Please know. That'd be great. I know he's a good guy. He's going to be left. I mean, do Kaka he's finished already. You know he's dead in the water. Go ahead. They're off finished. You know, one by one it's like dominoes. You know they're all falling over. Now there's this one that seems pretty interesting to me. If you got what is name was. Hmm. Are you really impressed you? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Very gold water right there. I'm talking about. Alphlandon. Yeah. Yeah. Alphlandon. Yeah. William Jennings Brian. Huh? William Jennings Brian. No. Anita Brian. No. Bear Brian. No. Brian from the ice cream store. Yeah. Yeah. That one. Finally. Fine. Okay. Okay. It's only only live once anyway. Yeah. Okay. Bye. Thank goodness. Yeah. You can say that again. Yeah. Jill's a stationary sort of sums it all up. Life's a bitch. It's a bitch. She's great. She is. She's only 15. And you would stand. It's 15. It'll get you 20. Yeah. But that's that's his best. We can talk to her. You know. It's okay to talk. Well, I have no. I have no problem with her. I just a friend. I agree. And everybody who listens understands that. I'm old enough. Even you really understand that. Well, it's like go crazy. I'm always talking this morning about, you know, target practice and shoot the zipper. Something about me wants to shoot me. Shoot the zipper. I got news for you. He better have very good aim or be. Meaningless. Meaningless, Joey. I love these Johnny come lately. He's coming to think they know what they're talking about. You know, he just has no clue. So like flailing out in all directions desperately. Kind of like that picture there. Lost in space. There's Jill. Is that interesting though? Now when Jill is holding the camera and taking the pictures. But how all these people smile. Mm-hmm. Can I say something without getting you upset? And without the audience think that I'm being a sour grapes? I don't know. Well, it's nothing to do with you. Oh, good. Hi Rob. But no, seriously. This one here. I don't want to say his name. I don't want to get anybody any more upset. He's not as good as, um, he's okay. Right? Yeah. He's cute. But not. Not God. Okay. But Jill, this could be an injury. But that's not a, is that amazing though? How some people don't take good pictures? Right. Because that's a terrible picture. I mean, he doesn't look that good there, doesn't? Mm-hmm. No. But in person, um, behind that check out at Windixie. So not to make you just want to stay there in shop all night. Work all day and shop all night. Well, listen, we don't want to get carried away now. Yes, all day. All those people in the audience get very nervous and, you know, then we get all those comments going to be getting carried away. You're all upset. And Jill's a knockout, by the way. Keep saying that, but it's true. She's 15. You know? I know. But she is. What is that? We don't hear it now. What? I wish you just say hello. You seem very uptight and unfriendly for the best DJ on the dial. We'll see you with Papa and starting Thursdays and Sirty Peter. It's got a name and friends. Add charge for doorwork. You may question.оздio. There's plй house and bon پی�یہس своей around. This is quite an emergency. Okay, let's hear some data from something we're in here. Wow. I am not the kind of guy in the Kil Joy. Tell me on what it says. Did you talk to me about Dr. What's something I've told you about? Yeah. So we can run right there. I'd like to catch once this summer anyway, you know? Yeah. I mean, Mike Gonzalez has done great for me, but 320, how much can you cash at 320? You don't understand, Mike? He doesn't let's get serious with Peter. Who is this guy? Sweet, doesn't understand. Uptight and unfriendly, you knew all of the pain in his feet. No, most of my nights, I shouldn't say that. That they come up to me, and I'm always nice to them at the track. Wherever it is. Look at the, you know, what's the rub there the other night? A thousand, although it dwindled the 500 on Joey show. We just five hundred on the morning. But well over a thousand people. He wasn't there. Who cares? I didn't see anybody with a walker. I don't think. I know why did you say the food that was coming is Northern Italian? Yes. Like in Joey Pinto, Northern Italian, like from Buffalo. Yes. Uptight and unfriendly. Peter, if you're listening, I don't know what that you're talking about. I mean, when I go to the window, I'm not, see, one thing that bothers me is when people schmooze at the window, right? There are people online. You should pardon you, expression behind you. And it bugs me if there's somebody in front of me and the, the teller is, ah, they're going on and all, well, I think the three about the pop and all the other crap that's, it's bad business. Okay, that's good. Right? I mean, you gotta get through bed and buzz. Yeah, you can't bet after the race starts. Yeah. I mean, I hate to break the news to you, but you're on. In other words, you can't wait till they come to the top of the stretch and the forehours ahead by eight lengths and I'd say, okay, give me 500 to win on the fore. Oh, you're kidding. No, it doesn't work that way. Okay. Oh, I mean, that's your point. You gotta get to bed and, you know, you got limited time. Right. People shouldn't smute. Smooth. Smooth. Don't smute. Or you lose. I don't smooze and I still lose. Okay. I'll tighten off. Oh, gee. I mean, that's, I mean, appreciate all these wonderful gifts. But, like this nose clip, which will come in handy, you know, or is this a beat clip, I guess, to hold a beat closed? Okay. Let's go back to the phone. I'm not going to take it personally because I'm sure that they met it in good spirit, right? And I have a Rob's little note. Now, let's see. I this to me indicates a young man who is secure. And if you look like him, you'd be secure too. And, you know, he doesn't just know that's a radio show. Nobody molests him when we go in there to shop. Hmm. They think about it. But, like I said, looking is great. Right. And he understands that he's not uptight to not the one of these, nervous, nullies, so to speak. Good. Good. They'd count. He, hello. Are you guys doing? Okay. Listen. I want to let you guys know that guy who came in and jumped on over Hank. Hank, go to date with our new year and said that he dedicated that I 95 songs to Mr. Crane for good. You know, for what he was doing with this SS key thing. Good for Hank. Wow. I wouldn't know. If anybody over there had the balls to tell it like it is. That's right. That guy won't get off Hank's case. Good. Hank did take a stand. I'm not on Hank's case. I like Hank. He's a good guy. Yeah. I want to find out from the bird that he's got over his little calling from yesterday when they got date came in. He's all over that now. He's making a slow recovery. Yeah. I thought he might have had a feeling for it. And everything that's probably why he left. But he seems to be doing okay. Listen, now that cow's leaving, I need a job. I'm unemployed. I can do, I can do the job cow was doing. No chance. We bring the replacement straight out of the psychiatric ward at Jackson's. So I'm afraid no chance. Oh, that's terrible. All right. Well, you guys have a good weekend. Good luck to you. Enjoy yourself tonight. Okay. And keep up the good work. Good luck. And tell joy to take height. Okay. I'll read the dirt. Yeah.

The problem probably is a matter of fact, the problem is that all the people who to LA yesterday or on the line today and all the girls are tied up. Okay. Don't you think so? Uh, yeah, that's a theory. I don't know what I'm going to do now. Well, I have a suggestion, but we won't mention it on the air, especially during the lunch hours. I Michael Jackson glove, right?

And many good restaurants when you come right down to it. Ah. Well, it doesn't. I mean, like what you're talking about, can't face your lawn and that kind of, not talking about on that level. JJ is probably one of the best, you have to be restaurants in the city. Oh, this is what you're looking for. Oh, yes. We just need to get into Miami restaurant. And the food is excellent. And what we're saying about what I pay for my own meal. You know, was that a little shot did I proceed there in the beginning? Well, I thought all of these people invited you. I got news for you. One of the reasons I don't go back to a lot of places is because I'm not a snorow. Okay, and I've mentioned that. I don't know how many times I've mentioned that. I don't like previous. A same loves previous. I don't like previous. No, nor snorow. Nor snorow. Well, you didn't have to be invited. I haven't even. Who's that? Did an open cotton python? I don't. I have every intention of paying. If they don't charge me, I can't impose it upon them. There are some restaurants that are sponsored where sometimes they pick up the checks. Sometimes they don't. I just didn't pay for it every time. I'm not starving to death. There's a look like I'm missing any meat. No, not at all. You said that in Mr. Lee. Everyone's in the long end. That's a good restaurant. Yeah, Chinese. There are a lot of, I'll be honest with you. I said this to Stan last night. If I had a hundred bucks for every bad restaurant and date and bro, I could retire. That's true. No problem at all. That's true. Do you like Joe? I've never been there. I'm not in the seafood. So, you know, I hear their states are good, but I have other things. I'm not going to go over there and stay in online for a stone friend. I don't like the statuous. Is it really? Yeah. I hope it's better than the forage. Yeah. The forage is, average, the amount that came back. It's a pound of food. It's gone down. I already have a little story. That's a wait a minute. Where's that taste by the way? Aren't you going to share that with us? A little story that most actually tended to be from UPI. A man was killed in Davenport, Iowa, when he demanded ketchup on his French fries. Police. Police, a Joe Jones, a stand. This is a true story now, sir. Come on. Oh, my God. Police have no doubt. Good. Sir, come down. Police, a Joe Jones was stand after becoming in rage. There was no catch at the go on. The potatoes is real friend is just fried. According to authorities, Jones attacked Tony Hinton. Police a week before a kitchen life in Standham. She's been charged with voluntary manslaughter. She's been charged with voluntary manslaughter. What's happening? The random guy in Standham is far over a lot of the university. My name is Yine Orden. All right. Oh, it's not. It is haunted in other restaurants I like. What? Marshall Maygard. Yeah, that's what I was saying. Oh, well, he listened to this stuff. Can't be honest. It's serious about that. I am being honest. What happened to your ears? What? You haven't been there in years? That's not true. You're not sure. When you calm down a little bit of city. Would you calm down a little bit before you start explain to anybody on the show? I like Marshall Maygard. I love their. I love the way to bring it. That big bowl of Montibals who from the poor, the soup over the Montibals and the Newdo's and I've never had a bad meal there. When the last one you were there. Oh, three four months ago. So they're all the time when I mean that neck of the words. Well, well, you've seen that. You probably like the rest of the house. You know? I don't travel for food. It's not that good. Well, listen, I know this great place where they got french fries that will knock your socks off. Where? They don't have any ketchup though. I'll bring my own. Oh yeah. I'm just a joke. Okay, have a wonderful day. Good day. Okay. Oh, he was just. The top is right. What was the big deal with Marshall Maygard? I like Marshall Maygard. Two wishes, yeah. I thought, yeah, it was. They got a great stuff habit. You like stuff. Yeah. Sure. But there's some of the other things that I think got kishki. Now, I'm telling you who had the best kishki, which you're an expert of course on that. You don't even know what it is. It was up there. The place that closed up in the gallery. Oh, the gallery. Yeah. The deli that closed up from New York. Well, the, um, that will not walk me. That's all. It's going to be a shot. You know, the one I'm talking about. The Carnegie. Thank you. Oh, yeah. Yeah. What am I going to do after Saturday? Oh, boy. When Kyle was working, Kyle will just have to hang around for four hours. You want to answer the phone. It's just for messages on the, yeah. That's a good idea. For another dollar an hour, you know. But, um, but I think Glenn's great. Keep him on. The endo. I think he shrinks about three inches every morning after your show. Well, at least he's got that much to start with, you know. Some of us would have a real problem. Okay. Have a great weekend. Thank you. Happy young kippers. It just did not go. Okay. It just did Joe come just trying to loosen him up a little over his, uh, go your show up ringing here. Yeah. You don't say happy young pride and now I think it was Friday. I know I learned when I came to this town. Happy your tournament. Yeah. I made that mistake. That famous. If I were you, it isn't anywhere near sundown yet.
