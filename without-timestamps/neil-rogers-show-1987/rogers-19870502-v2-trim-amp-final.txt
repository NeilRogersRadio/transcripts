Can we, is this something we can see on the ear? Do I, then took a poll? Ah, very cute. Very cute. Just get off the phone. Ah! You creep. Ooh, stealing from Steve now by way of Bob Grant. That's a joke. Third generation stealing. Yeah, a joke. He said, get off my phone. I finished it. Don't forget now. Get those names and addresses in the mail as we can so far. P.O. Box, 2214. Miami, 33055. Get those checks in there too. And we're going to only circulate petitions in businesses and in condos and churches and synagogues. Or wherever else there are lots of people. And we're going to get individuals to get involved in this by sending in postcards. Or little letters with their name and address just saying, I support so far and free speak. Pretty simple, right? Yeah, they can't do that. I mean, if you want a petition will be more than half. Yeah, send you one. But if you're one of those many, the majority are not petitioning. I mean, you're not petitions. Gatherers. Right? Right. Like me, outside of petition, but I'm not going to go on. Yeah, you're basically a pretty lazy guy. Absolutely. Okay, it's 1018 at WI and Z. I'm the orangers, the indefatigable, Ernie Sochino B. L. He's going to five hour review of Shoah from 2 to 7 this afternoon. So clearance will win the Derby Jose Santos in a desperate drive and a furious final 16th of a mile. It's crypto clearance. Trust me. Why we share our out there at Calstream. I'll give anything to be out there with my good friend, Jean Stevenson. Oh, yeah. He'll be there. Looking for you. Thanks again, Jean. I couldn't have done it without you. I could never have gotten a book like that without your help. And Sunny Rosenberg, too. You believe that douchebag, Sunny Rosenberg is going to be replied. The Channel 10 editorial. Wow. That moron. The honorable mayor responding to the editorial about me. I was a majority Channel 10 Monday night, according to Ron Sacks. It's Ron turns out to be a pretty good guy after all. Yeah. We always thought he was a real pain in the neck. And I talked to Greg B. D. Who's doing some stuff for ten and he made a piece on the so far thing. He said he thought he would. He thought he could do it. Well, he better do it. Yeah. And I want to threaten your Greg. I think he'll do it. I think you will. If possible. Hollywood. Hello. How's it going? Pretty good. I think you just should simply flag land. Okay. That is the only answer to it. And I'm going to get Duffy and working on it. Hey, listen. I hope that your friends listen to you for the very first time. Could you please. I know it might be patently. Anything you want sir. Anything you want. What is it? There they go. I'll tell you they're quick today though. They really are waking up slowly. Let me read the memo again from our program. The main modular. Mark Tune dated April 28, 1987. Kathy West has decided to abandon the Saturday morning program on WINZ. Like the word abandoned. Yeah, it's interesting choice. Kathy and I have been working under the agreement that her transition to talk was an experiment. And we bang around with it and see how it goes for a few months. Banger Elle. Yeah. How'd it go? It's her decision to leave the show. I commend her for her hard work. a great attitude and her loyalty to the station. Not to mention becoming one of Neil's favorite targets. I get blamed for everything. We wish her well. Meanwhile, this is one of the most profound statements in the history of men. I want you to listen to this. Meanwhile, Saturday mornings continue on. Is that profound? Yeah, that's profound. You folks in the audience don't realize how lucky you are because if Mark hadn't written out in the memo, we might not even all be here right now. Saturday mornings continue on. Okay, is that profound? For him it is. The adventure continues. Now listen to this next line from the Dr. Mangala of talk radio. We will experiment further with some people. First one out of the shoot this week will be Glen Hill, State Tune. That's the memo. First one out of the shoot. Like, he shot you out of a cannon. Yeah, it's painful. I thought the first one out of the shoot would be the ten horse and they had derby today. For I'm Tony of this guy. They want the vices. They've already they're doing the vices. They've get it all today. Folks were playing all the material. The whole rack during this show today. As our way of saying thank you for being so indifferent to the show the last two days. It's true. It this happens to me. Air of re-rating book. We're not given the numbers on the year anymore. We won't talk about the ratings. In fact, I'll lie. No, I'll say, boy, we really did lousy. We stunned. Then they'll all or so. Don't feel bad. You know, they'll get a lot of calls. Simply calls. But every time when a book comes out, we did great this week until Wednesday. Till the book came out. Then the minute the book came out, Bingo. It's like, okay, we've got to paint not the tenured hands. Screw him now. You know, let's go on to something else. Like Sandy. Hop and oh, hello. Hello. Yes sir. Happy's race to remark. Which kind of race be remark? Which kind of race to remark was that? I don't know sir, but you bore the hell out of me. They harbor island. Hello. Hi. Yeah. I think the grand has class. And I think he has reclined the class. But last. And I think his last is charming. Especially when you go early in the morning. And just going around trying to get things together. And I really think he sounds like a very charming guy. Why is not, but he sounds like. He does sound like it. I wish a lot of good luck. Okay. Say thank you. Thank you, man. I appreciate the call. He said thank you. I really do. Okay. 10 30 right on the chair. 10 30 right on the nose. Glenn's got all these set up calls coming in. But once we get these out of the way, then the truth come. Yeah. Right. Now you have a couple of open lines. You have it exactly well in this audience. We have an open line in date. 624 0191. And one in Broward 764 0707. And speaking of Broward, if there are people in Miramar parents or students. I mean, it is Saturday. I'll allow I know that they don't listen to this show. But along with our survey on Glenn this morning. We want to hear from some of these wimps at Miramar high. You've got so upset because their principal was insulted on the air and the school and so on. They apologized because they thought to give the school a bad image. How stupid could they be, huh? That's Jeff Boucher, a student at Miramar high said that. Their school was getting a good image because the kids there had enough guts to stand up for what they wanted. Isn't that true? They were getting a good image. These were a bunch of students who believed in what they wanted. That's what they wanted. This is just then. What is this sound? Is this the hero? What I heard right here? I heard right here that I was just reading from. What are you guys going to get with it already? The lens is going to do the talk up on this. Step all over, man. I'm going to be so embarrassing that they're probably going back on Glenn's 94. And they haven't got any audience anyway. Trust me. See, I stepped on yesterday, but I wouldn't do it again. Perfect. I hear it once or twice. Perfect. Wasn't that good? Yeah. Big deal. Yeah. I feel like I'm on it nights again. Do a 40 minute screening wild monologue on the end of the world and something. Oh, no. I don't know. Boy, you're reading regressing this week. I'm telling you things are not just a bit of talk up this station. Folks, you better run all around with the sandwich board on. Because that's the only promotion we're going to get. All right. All right. Well, I can't believe what Kathy said on the area. So you kind of just wallstriped by it. I didn't hear it. I really didn't because I would have dumped it. You know, did you hear it? Yeah. Not I mean, you did Kyle hear it? Did you hear us say SH? She said it on the area, you know. Yeah. The loud and clear. Oh, yeah. I didn't hear it. Kyle is going to write me a message to talk. Because he would have dumped it if he would have heard it. Well, where is me? The next week. What if the line doesn't come back? Will you going to have on? Next Saturday morning. Yeah. I'm going to leave. Follow. Now, I'll come back. If they'll let me. Oh, I see. Kyle thought she said shift. I'm tired of taking your shift. Oh, there could be something really. Some sexual and you went to an ad. How did they take your shift? He was talking to the guy on a mobile phone. She got it. You remember? So she gave three reasons why she quit. A. Oh, I see. Like an air shift. I see. Yeah. So she's going to go raise her babies. B. Her husband is doing real well. She's got razor skirt probably. And he also started all letting her go. And three. She said Neil and tired of taking your shift. That's what she said. Basically. Well, that's what Kyle thought she said. There's nothing wrong with that. Right. But she left the F out. That's why we didn't dump it. Oh, boy. But further we go with this. Mary. Better. So worship. That's one of the seven. So worship. Now we got two of the seven. Anybody go for three. Feel like auctioning again. I'm sorry. Sir, what were you saying? I was going to say, I'll still plan that. Don't we'll talk about. Most listen to. Talk radio host on the show. I just want to. Well, when is the audience going to bombard him with complaints and say stop lying already? Okay. I'm going to have a call now. Thank you. Good. What a bunch of liars there over there, huh? They may not be number one in listeners, but they're number one in lies on W. S. News. You know how every book comes out. People find a story somewhere in the book. If you look under the column of lies, most lies per average quarter hour. They're number one. But see it doesn't. It says most listen to. Talk show host. Yeah. You know, you can say number one because all stay on on. Most listen to has to mean either. Or average quarter hour. Or even close to either one. See, I know. Courage an arbitron in anything. Right. Or wonder where. Or not even close. See on. Why 100. But they're number one someplace. You know, in the book. But. On the other shows is most listen to. Yeah, which is a blatant absolute lake rent. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's correct. It is not true. Shame on you, Alice. Hang your head in shame. Like Tom Doley, 23, Me, 411 and W.I. and Z. We're fighting out with the glinstal has a job. I'm really kind of surprised because there were a lot of those ladies who just despised. This, oh, one of Kathy's female fans said she didn't say it. I didn't think she said it. Yes, she did. I think you're hallucinating. I was saying next to her. She said it. Let's call Lee Fowler and tell him we got another guy hallucinating on the ear here. No. Like me and Jika. I don't think she said it. I wouldn't kid you about something like this. I wouldn't trust me. Easy for you to say. Twenty two, four, eleven of W.I. and Z. And some of you chickens in Miramarble. You better call in between now and two. I'm telling you because you have to. In one day. They blew it. Is that incredible? Hi. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes. How are you doing today? Really good. Okay. Just one criticism for Glenn. Good. I don't want them to get the same thing that Kathy had. That's the Bonnie Robles syndrome and that's a giggling of everything you say. Yeah. There's no room for another, Eggman on the air. But other than that, I think that he was certainly an improvement over Kathy and I wish him the best of luck sincerely. How about Kathy? You wish her the best of luck? Well, what's the difference? Let me ask you a question about the Derby. Yeah. All right. We're having on crypto clearance. Good. Okay. One to the ring. What? No chance on the other. I'll get the real Castile counterfeit counterfeit counterfeit. Okay. Bogeys. And I'll tell you another Bogeys horse is that Gull-Chie is known in the trade as a Puker. Yeah. Well, otherwise, it's for a far left of horse. When he gets to the top of the stretch and he looks down at long stretch of Churchill downs. He will puke it out. Let me ask you a question. Can you advance back that race at Colstries? Sure. What time are you in the knowing the open? You're in the near bed and then watch it at home? Yeah. The windows open like a 1230. Great. I appreciate it. Well, the back to what? Thank you a lot. How long? What do you mean Alabama? What does that mean? Hello. Hey. Yes. He's coming in great up here, Neil. Oh. I was going to have a call in the final. I have. Right. Wait a minute, sir. Up where? Do you know about them? Where? Do you know about 15 miles? 15 miles. What? 15 miles? Yes. Oh. You got a banjo on your knees, sir? Yeah. I'm going to pick up that real flag. Great. Got going in the back of the window. All right. Who knows? A crew dog? Yeah. Got my two-doll two. Great. Oh, how do you call the water hand or the water tube? Here about two weeks, Lord. What? What? Two weeks? Two weeks? Oh, how did I hear it? I spent a week in two egg one time. A week? Yeah. Well, since you started talking about them, we had a population's blue. You know, just like how in there. Really? Yeah. I mean, we had about four or five hards. A couple cows. A few horses. You knew the thing. We had a couple kids. And we'd all get out. Yeah. Well, it probably got more sense than most of the people who live up in two egg. That's right. That's your treat. That's not too far from Perry, is it? Perry Florida. No. Perry, New York. He. Well, I'm very young. There we are. It's about 120 miles. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah, we don't. I'm over there. Can I say this? No. Oh. Yeah, I was told to keep. I wasn't reading. Or really making it not for sheep who affects the next egg. Oh, boy. I was saying. Oh, my god. I enjoyed last matter of fact. That's really. I just great. And a little warm in here, by the way. I want to start complaining. But you're my people. People love that people of the earth. Okay. We got something coming up for you, sir. Okay. Thank you. And he said, limp rest. Friday nights. There to Miami cops with a hot new beat. They're on the streets fighting crime. Look, pal. We just don't do strip searches for J. Walkin. You can't waste the ice. We get a problem. The moon's getting you back and down. Lieutenant, in that the group of hairdressers who attack people on the beach, hold them down and then set their hair. Yeah, two seconds ahead. Let's go get on. They'll start the nothings that clean up the streets. I'm sorry for skipping on the note, skipping wrong. I hope you guys don't get on the beat. Just take a seat, pal. Grab with a chair. A chair. Yes. He was nice. All right. Stop your big pocket. I think you're part of I'm not a post-pocket. Oh, sorry. Just one. My head's there a couple of him. My mecups on a hot new beat. In key West Lights. Right in I tonight on MBC. There to Miami cops with a hot new beat. There are the streets fighting crime. They're pines. That's a hand-camp face there. What are you doing? In hell and build by. We're going to get a problem. The great games are two little trees. We're excited. And that's a group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early birds Special after seven. The back of town. Let's go get them. Yes. Stop it, nothing. Clean up the streets. They're lighting. You can't cross the area. You'll have to cross in the line. There they're determined. We clean up the smuggling business. All right. Sister, you're under arrest. Oh, so now you're arresting my wife. What's the charge? Station about her. I'm going to first see that white stuff. And just a thought. He's got over 100 bags in here. Oh, what? Sweet and low. And that restaurant. She just came out of the second man. Yes. There comes a him by me. Come from the hot new beat. He's in hell and there. Nice. He's leaving this fall on MBC. What do you want, Miss city where the mayor looks like a fagula like sunny rose and burger? A screamer. You're a screamer, sunny. Okay. Let's come down a little bit. We got the three hours to go. So far, Glen's got all his friends and relatives calling in. He's doing very well. I'm surprised the little ladies who hated Kathy. They've been quiet. See, they're happy now. So they don't have to say anything. They're just looking their chops. That really is. I'll show one couch potatoes. Stuck in Rusty. Tom's a nice dog. They're my husband. They're a good kiss to come home. Oh, beautiful old cold. And go out with him. A mouse from nail down boots and peels. It's all here. The headache, the headache, the pancake. Rock a bite. Just ears, my face. My name is Gary. Only race. Tommy fades. Here's the walk. But I called out from under. Don't you bother to hear the? If you tell your burden, hey, you're feeling well. You'll find you out like she went to go. We left and I have not walked into my house. I'm not seeing my puppies and my kittens and all those things. And I do friends that we love so much. The answer is, so I'm to the people in home. We love you. We wish you and. And we hope all of the people we love so much will forgive us. And help us to go on. It's getting to the point now where you can't tell the reedle from the make believe. I mean, I'm saying it's they become like a parody of themselves. 1107 at W.I.N. Z. And you'll run just here till two or he's so soon is going to be long. And it says on the board he's going to have. It had spud of couch potatoes. How does he do it? But we can't wait. How does Ernie manage to absolutely mesmerize the audience? It's incredible. That's got to be on the phone. Yeah, he couldn't be here. This guy's coming from the circle of your ranch. These are kosher potatoes of course. Miami Beach. Good morning. What do you know? Was that a fly that just came into the window? A good call. After 11. What? I'll lift here. A good as great. He is a crowded person. I can't read his writing here though. You love his laugh. Nice. Much better. Do I have a lot better job than Joe Johnson did on his urgent show on the other station? Okay. That was unmitigated disaster. Joe Johnson is a virgin, by the way. That's what Linda reported in her comment. I have a question. Did you think that during your celebrity calls last couple of days did you really call you up? He certainly did. We had about a 20 minute chat. Do you want to explore anything with you? No, he wanted to cheer some things with us. Oh, could he do you like to explore things? We're sure. And he has to. No, seriously, he just come back from 10 days at the Dissistos School. I'm not making that up. I know it's hard to believe, but it's true. And he said it with a straight face. Yeah. That he's having his head shrunk up there. Not in the final eight years. So long time. I just curious, does I've just come into the AM Park radio listening for quite a while, maybe a year and a half? How often does this shifting around the people occurring? Does this like a lot of it's an IOD? It's like every two days. Because people from Lebanon, 94, gone to television. People from television have come to radio from FMDA. And it's like you got to keep a little card and see what all the players are. Yeah. That's primarily an IOD. They change the lineup. See, there's so much in the sports that they've got this kind of lineup philosophy. And when things don't work, they just erase it and they put somebody else in the clean-up spot. You know, it's kind of there. They're like the locker room in town. They suffer from over there. Oh, I'm glad you're on your rating. Thank you. I'm glad somebody is taking notice of it. Oh, it's great. Well, I thought you were in the 11th or 11th, but I wouldn't show it. The numbers were... No, no, 7's and 8's. I guess that's real good too. Well, the daytime, it's like a Twilight Child. It's so good. Nobody believes it. I had another final question. Now, those, those, uh, smooth, final cast when, you know, I mean, I was wondering how you all do that. How they play your material at the same time you're doing it. And just like some kind of, the technology that we don't know about. Yeah, well, we have this thing. When you're doing things and then you start playing music and then off and now, start doing the same thing. I just think it's incredible technology going on. Well, years ago when I lived in Boston, many, many years ago, a WBZ in Boston used to have a sub-carrier in Springfield, WBCA. In fact, they used to be a station break, WBZ in WBCA Springfield. W-w-w-w-w. South Miami. Yeah, South Miami, Miami, Miami. Fort Lodderdale. I also was kind of a Dean bits that are pieced together in other station breaks. W-w-n, W-w-a, South Miami, Miami. Fort Lodderdale, Miami Beach. Audges, Kendall. I mean, you know, they were recorded like on 15 different weeks in different pictures of voice. One can had, he had learned judice on one of them. And it just really sounds good, man. It sounds almost as good as Alrain, Tell, South Florida's most listened to, Talked Show Host. They just, you know, they just go on oblivious. They think they really are insulting the intelligence of all of South Florida. They think everybody out there is a moron and we'll believe no matter what they put on the air. And of course, there's one about 2% who do. Hey, Michael's from W-w-h-r. What we should do is, whenever a group of us as an answer sort of together, it's, it's have a director and then only, only have one mic on it one time. And do like they do in television. And then Neil can do his Oprah Winfrey. You can run around with the microphone and say, what? Goodbye Neil, have a great show. Is that it? Oh, he hung up on us. God, well, I see we boxed him into a corner. He boxed himself into a corner. He is a ran man. That's J. J. What's his name? J. Michael. I'm only K. Mark W. Whatever. From Horr Radio. W-w-h-r. What call it? The Big Horr on your radio. 1130 at W-y-n-z. We have an open line in Broward where we just, we're hung up on us for a very big radio personality. Larry Kent. 764-0707. 764-0707. My any hello. Good. Okay, don't speak to me. That's okay. What bother me at all? Big. 1130-070707. My name is J. J. We have an open line in date now. 6 out like at the prom. Okay. In Miramar. Miramar High. We're so sorry. I just didn't say I see we think it will all the best. We're going to be our best behavior. Can we bring some jelly beans to the prom? The President likes jelly beans. Oh. Spreading folks, the soft Florida malaise. Spreading from Halendale to Miramar. Next thing is going to cross the county line in the Carroll City. We're going to be swallowed up in a big cloud of mong. Oh, look out. It's coming up the road. We can see it up on 47th Avenue. It's rolling under the turnpike overpass. It's rolling down in front of 207th Drive. And here it comes. Crawley right up to the street to the WI and Z studio. Welcome. Oh, Neil. This is Craig. You don't want to strike. Not ever waiting. Bucking up pocket. Listen. I went to park to my foster. The gang is kind of radio management. And I can't even get a raise. You don't want to fly to go by. I'm going to throw out a dollar in your pocket. On a scale of 10. About a minus four. But not too bad. Keep our work it on. And I'm working on it. Anyway. I'm going to say we already do positive on this show. If you want to knock somebody call somebody else. I don't knock. Really see the problem as I can't get my voice out. Hi. Yeah. Because I said, I can. I can. Well, listen. I'm enjoying the show today. It was definitely a lot better than last Saturday. Last Saturday was. I was embarrassed for you guys really to point a phrase. But. Uh, I'll wait a minute. We have a young mate now. Wait a minute. Can you verify this? I have an important message on the screen. I'm going to say that you're going to be a good man. So he would donate a hundred dollars to so far. If we would play Tammy phase. Record albums spot in the next minute. Your hold on. I want you. Of course. Your hold on. Is that legit? Okay. I'm still having a whole lot of makeup. And say a lot of praise for you. Finally. But 10 records set. You've been waiting for. Tammy says unbelievable new album. Here's the rock. I crawled out from under. I put six T-tons of makeup on. Then my husband does it with kiss. Come home. Oh, better for cold. And go I will. Am I strong now down boots and peels? It's all here. The headache. The headache. The pancake. The coffee. Tammy phase. Here's the rock. But I cold out from under. Don't you buy my new album? If you're doing a burn in hell, you're feeling weird. Thank you. God bless you. Okay, sir. I'm sorry about that. I'm a problem. The corruption. This is where they got. Listen. I enjoy Glenn. You got to quit laughing so much. You know, I can't help it, sir. This man here. He's just a silly person. Yeah, I'm silly person. And that is not like Ed McMan. My laughter is legit. That's what's frightening. Yeah. Everybody's laughing. You need to fight. Everyone's voices. You have your laugh. Yeah. But a lot of work. I enjoy it. You try to say goodbye. I'm a client. Your sex scandals or whatever she was into. I mean, I don't know. But I heard she wasn't very good-looking. It's long glad I didn't go all the way out to see me. It was that tiny Tim West. Oh, God. I need Tim. Really? That was you look right. And she's the one that said that. Well, I don't know. He's patterned yourself after tiny Tim. You think all right, but she's, you know, just, I don't know. She just had something missing. You know, there was something missing. Like a brain. Oh, God. Poor Kathy. I hope you two are still friends after you. We are. I don't know what you really told Linda. I guess we'll read it on Monday. And the hair roll. Maybe tomorrow. Oh, boy. Well, okay. Well, listen. I just wanted to call and say, uh, Neil, I support you so far after. And I'm going to be standing away real soon for, uh, petition. What the heck? I'll find 25 people somehow. Great. But, uh, enjoy the show as always. It's always great. And, uh, Glenn, keep up the good work. And, uh, really give those wimps and Miramar hard time. Because I can't believe that a city that I was raised in and, and I, I went to, I can't believe that can be so fine with them. Come, uh, give me a break. Okay. Thanks a lot. All right. Take care. Okay. Great caller. When you say was good. Absolutely. And tinkled a lot. But he was good. Uh, next caller is on a mobile phone. Hello. And he, oh, congratulations on your rating. Oh, that was good. Another one goes in. Tiques in Damia. Sunrise. Hello. Yes. Oh, you can hear me. Oh, I thought it was close away. Come on. They're going nuts again. Analyst. I like the issue for a favor. For the 5 weeks I've been trying to explain to my wife, Patty, about the different good you do and the things you play and trying to describe the Michael Jackson thing. And I know you really are not crazy about people calling and requesting. But if you can play that, then the next year, Sarah, I appreciate it. Hello. This is Michael Jackson. Urging you to help stop the spread of social disease. Don't risk your life by having a romantic encounter with an unfamiliar place. I urge you to do like I do. Go at a loan. Have made sure you wear protection. That's why I recommend the Michael Jackson gloves. Why not either hand the Michael Jackson mask out of the security case of my eyes that I need to do it. Nice and. So remember before you throw that, put it on. And. Oh, Michael Jackson gloves. Who have been once again that I've heard on a hand is better than one in the bush. A better than sick one model for extra stimulation. Okay, now this next call is either from La Bell or from Patty La Bell. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Hey, don't be late. Long time listener talk radio on South fly live many years in Fort La Del and we're in La Bell, which is the county seat of Henry County. Right. And we are about 30 miles and Fort Myers. And we're really up on what's going on pretty much through your efforts, for us to take a lot of times. And also we are a record store. And we received billboard all time. Uh huh. And it's quite interesting, like you say, with the controversy that, you know, that if people didn't want to listen to some of the shows, they could turn them off. And listen to some of the other stations, I have some friends that work for. In the technical report of another station that you mentioned quite often. That's on 441. Oh, yeah. Are they playing in traffic today? No. No. Uh, I don't know what their station is. But I, like I said, most of the long time friends that do work in a technical people over there. And one year former production people is now the news director of our local radio station up here. Who's that? Tony. I can't remember his last name. I just met him the other day. He just came up here last Monday. He worked in production at wins because he came into the day and said, hey, that's my old station on the air. And he is on the air up here. They have 3,000 watts. So they have a big, what was the ingredients? They're basically a country station. But the, uh, Miramar high school thing is very interesting because here in Lebel, which I described as being two hours and 30 years away from Miami, the Lebel high school prom guess what their theme is. Never say goodbye. How'd you guess? In Lebel. Yeah. Oh, man, I'm telling you, these kids over in Miramar, they ought to hang their heads in the shame. And the interesting part about this county is our basic images. You know, good old boys, right next to them. You just got to the surface. Yeah. Like myself, they're from New Jersey or with many years in Chicago, in New York or South Florida and, you know, in Miami, Fort Lotto, Del area. And got tired of old silliness like the high on Del come up to me and those and so forth. Yeah. Uh, I remember back when some of the other 12 people first came to Miami, and they're quite interesting, but over the years, kids hurry, boring listening to the same thing over and over. And, um, I lived for many years to stop side to city of Danielle. We were involved with some of the politics and then around the hour of county. And it's amazing how long they let somebody's politicians still stay in office. Yeah, well, listen, it's just about everybody waiting for a lot of nails. So, uh, there's nobody left to vote them out. This is true. This is true because the area I live in, we're outside the bell and everybody has two and a half acres. And almost go on neighbors with very few exceptions are from South Florida. And we're talking about, you know, 600 different people, you know, and which is a small area up here, but you know, we've compared the bower. And we're down there quite a bit, you know, for business reasons and everything. And it's like you say, how on day I was marching with in South and whatever. Yeah, the sunny Rosenberg deaths in Rome is covering the whole area. Pretty soon they'll be moving to the right restaurants in town. They'll have to get them that to the time, you know. Like what? They're one Chinese restaurant there. It's on federal and, um, town they'll be 12 hours. Tiny. Many of it. We're in there one time, about a couple months back. Yeah, pretty well. Okay, well, pretty decent is one thing, but sensational is, Oh, okay, well, we're gonna go on. We're comparing to some of, you know, living in the country and going to the big city type. It's pretty decent. Yeah. Well, I bet you've got great cuisine in La Bell, huh? Yes, yes, our specialty is swamp cabbage. Mm-hmm. We have a big swamp cabbage festival every year, which is why most of the people get swamp fever up there. Not really. You mostly people are pretty, pretty much up, hip on what's going on. And in fact, I don't know if you saw Bill Board this week about the clerk up in Bay County, which is up in the Panhandle, was arrested for selling two lives. Oh, yeah. In fact, I've heard it first on the news on your show last week, some time, and on our one distributor we deal with all the time. My MIA had mentioned it. And that has been the number one seller in South Florida for months now. And in fact, when their full-inch dance record came out in the fall, kids were begging for it. And that was the dirty version of it. Mm-hmm. The album has the clean version. Yeah. So I can imagine what these people do if they heard the other version. Thank you. Thank you. First thing for a long time, sometimes we don't get the call and just let it say we do run a lecture. Or we keep up on what's going on pretty much with the entertainment industry. 26th to one of the video lines. I'll make a deal starting next Saturday. I'll come into about 9.59, 9.29, 30 maybe. And Glenn will stick around till about 10.20 or 10.30 and that's it. That's all across over. We're going to do it. And I'm going to overdo this during the week. We're going to sit him over in the corner in the room. He can laugh way in the background. So only people with good hearing can hear it. And I don't want to get blamed for everybody else for their success, for their failure, for when they quit, for when they have a baby. I mean, how can I get blamed for that? I mean, that's really reaching. Huh? It's incredible. Here field, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes. What are you doing at work? Should be a Gulf stream. I know. That's where I'm going about now. Great. I'm going to go bet that. What are you betting? Oh, no. Come on. Are you serious? Hey, Dick, Dick was on the other day. Yeah. And he said that they couldn't Gulfskut when they had a band to take them there. It wasn't Gulfskut. I read the articles. Compote. They were talking about. Well, let me tell you. They can put Gulfskut right on, make it a milk wagon and put him side by side. They don't like them, huh? When they hit the top of the stretch, Gulfskut will be in reverse and by the way, his dosage index is 4.71. Anything over for it. No horse with a dosage index of over four has ever won the derby. Uh-oh. I'm in trouble. Now listen, I don't want to tell you. Yeah, I know. Look at that. We just got food coming here that you wouldn't believe. Hey, I was going to tell you, you know, when you had that early bird special, they should make a steak race, early bird steak. They do have them. They have early bird stallion states. It's right in the program. Well, they should have like a hundred old people who have to set up for all of race. And that's the finish. We're going to set up lobster shrimp and steak. Yeah. Let them go. And you can be the stewant. Ha ha ha ha. Excellent. What do you do? You'll be behind that boat for better hours. You're bad. So it's a good luck in the day, V. You're lucky to you. I hope you win a million today. Okay. Take it off. We've got somebody frying you to Dave Payphone. Happy would be excited about today. Hello. Are you really frying? No. Why you on the hot seat now, sir? I listen to you. I listen to you. It's really going to pleasure listening to you. I've been listening to you for about a week now. I got tired of falling asleep at the wheel on the FM. So I turned your dial on and pretty interesting. Welcome to the wheel world, sir. Yeah. All right. What I want to talk about is, uh, tap. He's really disturbing. Yes. Real disturbing. I had a chance to listen to you yesterday. I've been listening to you all week and I've been hearing you talk about it. Finally I listened to you yesterday and I've got to go to the Strop at Strop in Pullover. Oh. She's unbelievable. You want to start talking bend over? He wants to start everybody. I just can't believe my ears. And she says he's well educated. I'll tell you one thing, which he has guessed in her home. They all stand up. They never sit down. They don't trust that woman. She's totally unbelievable. Um, you know, the funny things she was talking about. Trouble dealers and how I think it's not to be an execute all the drug dealers. And that's for the, uh, his home and me because I know some personal friends that got sort of caught up in the business. And they're not really bad people. They just got caught up in the wrong thing. And, you know, and I've now they're out and they're doing their life. They're doing well. And just think of what she was in the office or wherever she was. They'd be dead. 40 people. Yeah. Taffy's going into business with the premise where I she'd. I just don't know where she got her education from. Where is that mess card? Nick Cohen. Uh, I'm dignified and propriety was the name of the game. It's a holy app. You know, uh, she doesn't come across killing television to maintain. Well, you see the problem is all these most of the listeners in this town and probably in all town, they play personality. And why am I picking on tapping? She didn't come on every day. And she can see the most outrageous, the most objectionable, racist, bigoted, disgusting, uh, genocidal, uh, maniacal things. Well, you're picking on tapping and all these young foods, you know, calling like, like she sang something that makes sense. I mean, this woman's spew, she makes Hitler look like Santa Claus. It's unbelievable. And I'm supposed to sit here and all well, you know, she never stole a freight train and be Mr. Nice guy. All right. One of these listeners going to grow up, you know, it's all a relate to his personality. I mean, the substance of anything that is said just flies right on by. What personality? Why is right on by? You don't know what personality it's not going to about. I know. I think you're a scary, I, I, I, I, you know, and there are a lot of people joke about it, but, uh, you know, some of the things you think about, I just don't know where to get to my, I don't know if you get to my, um, comic, or, I mean, she thinks she thought to the Gestapo was a bunch of school crossing guards. I'm serious. Well, I'm really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really. Anyway, I just like to say I enjoy listening to you. So good thing she's not on the weekend because the initial would be the Saturday show with the initials would be SS. I'm from, I'm from, I'm from. How did I switch that? Good girl. Okay. Like she and Nancy Sinatra are going to make a record. These boots were made for. And what else? Hello. How you doing? The deal with the K. Deal with the K. All right. Hey, Doug. I've been listening to this morning talking about WPLP. Yeah. You're a friend with San Diego. You remember this when it was WFFO? Right. Right. Yeah. Remember it while the DJs on their Chuck E. Farley, Fred and I scored you. His name was Charlie Folly Show. And it was Chuck E. Farley. Oh, no, God. I don't remember that. Or last year, it would have worked well on that stage. Farley years ago, couldn't believe it. Now you're serious. Sometimes I scored you. Yeah. It was great. That was the best rockin' hole radio station can floor. Yeah, they used to be like, Right. I mean, they were the big 57. I mean, I'm from what I have. Couldn't even hear it. We've lived in the static just to hear it. I never heard of it. Well, they used to be on only in the day time. They went 24 hours a week later. They went all-fox. I'm believe. I remember WLCY, right. Yeah. I've been other thing to have to mention to you guys about Chippe Gore. Yeah. To get your dictionary there, Neil. Look up, go on the dictionary talking about things being having two meetings. Look up the work, Gore. Where's the dictionary? Somebody take her out of her? It's what you're going to read there. It's going to be just going to be typical. Oh, there it is. Somebody was trying to hide it under Taffy's electrified seat. I can't believe it. We get that out of here. What are you giving the dictionary please? You got all these naked pictures sitting back there. I can't stand it. Under Taffy's seat, no less. Oh, yes. She hit him under there. But I tell you, look out for those women with a whip shing. Yes. Denny Pester, birdie picture. Yeah. Denny Green Mode. Cover's the whole wall, by the way. It's disgusting. Okay, Gore. Gore. Gore. Okay, Gore. To cut into a tapering triangular form. As long. To provide with a Gore. A small, usually triangular piece of land. A tapering or triangular piece. As a plop in a skirt. To pierce or loon with a horn or tusk. Yes. Yes. Blood. Clotted blood. Hmm. That's it. That's it. Unbelievable. It's either kind of allows you dictionary as this. Oh, it's a bunch of no. It's a piece of life. It depends how you use it. And this is the woman who's walking around, talking to everybody that's different. So that means so and so. Can't play this record. Can't play that record. Unbelievable. Yeah. Wow. She's a piece of. That's the piece of go. She's a work. Yeah. Well, see what I've said or isn't there. And I want to talk to that. I was at the park where I figured out food. I was. I was. You know, the problem with the park was that you'd have to guys not on a stage. If you had to. If you were a little elevated. It was like, you know, if you were two people back around the ring that they put around your. You couldn't see. That's what nobody could see a thing. Well, thank goodness for that. And I'm a different. It's like, like, it was like the surface. Well, that's not why we're not doing anymore. The 90's always an unmitigated disaster. You know, like we yesterday show it's. Thank God. The surface. That's where I get running to. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's in good luck. I'm talking to you. Have a great life. Yeah. Somebody called me to tell me the channel seven now on the baseball game. Neil Heatner's pitching against the. Metz. Who cares? You know, what kind of a message is that? I couldn't hear about. He's a wonderful. Boy, Neil Heatner. I heard that brother in the pitch. Did you have a boy? He was a bright guy. He was great. Okay. 25 till two. At WI and Z. We do have what open line. We thank Phil and the people from the Delhi then. All of I don't know if that's for me. What am I thanking him for running a lot of food? That's probably for Ernie. You know, Ernie steals all of my sponsors anyway. That's for Ernie. That's for Ernie. That's for Ernie, right? Come on, Phil. Be honest with me. And I cheesecake. No. It's got a circle you wanted. I can't believe it. It's from the circle you ranch. See, that's what happens when you become super Jew. That's early sochen. He just super Jew. Ernie subject today. Jews in Miramar. Can't believe it. So I make fun of us. What is all that stuff? This is Jewish food. This is home and stuff. Oh, my God. Thank you. We're making fun of us Jewish. We're in a $1 gentleman. That's great. We could end up with a sandwich with my wife. I had a carry the home and touch in the man's house. He asked me the home and touch. They pruned her poppy seed. I hope they're poppy seed. Oh, thank you. Phil knows I won't need to prune. Look at that layout. That's good. That's for my new housewarming this weekend. He didn't even know I was moving. Did you? Okay. Let's do our second break here. And I think we may start eating. No, what a cost to open a home equity credit line at American savings. I agree. I'll tell them themselves and for the people in the audience who can't share the good food. Top. Yeah. Let's get you on show. You know, I think these poppy seeds are the same. Man, I'm telling you these are home and touch in there. So good. Would you like some car was sitting here? He wouldn't know what to have some of the sandwiches. But he won't want them. I'm sorry about him. You'll put some stuff on. No, no, no. Don't watch it. Believe me. Oh, what hair and you had these go in the house. Oh, no, no, no, no. They just eat them a lot harder. They don't know. They're nice people. Let's take a call from the girl. But can we only got a few minutes left? Did everybody wants to hear something? Which is good. Because that'll kill time while we eat. Hello. Hello. How you doing? Hey, are you using me to kill time, huh? Yeah, you talk and we'll eat. Okay. I got a new subject for you. I want to talk a little bit about the taxation legislation. That was all good. I'm leaving. Why? And this is set up, come on. Hey, just set up. No, no, I couldn't understand how lawyers would test this law that would tax their services. And there aren't that many lawyers up there, amazingly. Well, I think I may have come up with the answer on the radio the other day I heard that now that the tax legislation is passed. We're going to pay for services on our dry cleaning and all of taxes on our dry cleaning and all sorts of other services. The lawyers are now going to file suit from what I believe I heard on the radio. We're going to file suit to prevent this tax from going through for legal fees because it prevents the poor from having access to the court. And it just amazes me. I don't know why, but I just knew there was some angle. Yeah, they're suing themselves. Exactly. What about the poor being able to get their clothes dry cleaning? I mean, what? Yeah. You know, that's all I wanted to comment on. I wanted to, you know, get your comments to see what your thoughts were. Let me tell you what it has to do with anything going out in Tallahassee. It's you might as well just put your head in the sand and cry. It's all I can tell you. It is so embarrassing. They are such a bunch of gutless, finest cowards up there. It's beyond belief. And that includes both parties, both parties. It's incredible. If you wonder why people don't take any interest in politics in this state and in this country, all you have to do is take a look at what most of them are doing. Well, I might take this moment to also to comment on our automobile insurance and the fact that, you know, I think it's liability insurance is not required. And it just causes those of us who won't go without insurance. Those of us who have anything at all in this world who would to protect or just wouldn't do that to other people. To pay through the nose. That's right. You got it. That's right. I did a show on it here a couple of months ago. We had the whole panel here and everybody blinged everybody else. And in the meantime, we can't do anything right. You're in Florida, my friend. What can I tell you? I am new to Florida. This is the not-know-how state. Where are you from? Well, I grew up in New Jersey, New York area. Oh, well, listen. And I went to school in Florida, believe it or not. I have lived in many different places including overseas. And I came back to the grow, if I liked the grow. So, but it's fascinating. It's a different culture. And it's just to me, it doesn't make any legislators want sense to pass a war that makes your tax was different from other states. Well, don't forget, this is Governor Note-Tax. Yeah. People find their way around. I mean, they do in New York and New Jersey every day where the New Jersey don't tax clothing or food and New York they do. And everybody goes from New York to New Jersey and buys their clothing and food. And I guess we can take a tax as well. I mean, people find their way around it. But the poor people won't. So, you know, they're not helping anybody. Yeah, well, it's probably a Castro plot. We're all going to be getting on ships and going to Havana. Why are, uh, take our dry cleaning? Well, that might be interesting. Yeah. Or to China for that matter, you know, get a good Chinese laundry. Well, listen, hang in there and welcome to Florida. I wanted to say a Chinese laundry, isn't it? You're in for some real surprises, trust me. Okay. Good luck. Interesting. Okay. It's at 17 before two at WI and Z. What are all these people want from us? You know, they just want to keep playing the same stuff over and over. They don't want to hear me. They're disgusted with Glennon as laugh. They're not happy about the good food that came in here. Couples. Concerned about. What? How's it? How's it? Protect condoms. Adoration of black flag. How's the garden? That's the golden vision. She thinks it's 1887. They're gonna wake her up. A baby's on her head's car. She's in the prison. They're the 10 records that you've been waiting for. Tell me, say, under little big new album.

Should we take a call from Halondale, even with the. Aller roast beef and corn beef and home entache and Bontani. What a spread. There's even a little cake here that says seven share. These people of the Delhi den are incredible. Hi, but you shouldn't be talking about that food and I don't have any. I kneel and plan how you do it. Let me ask you. Are you eating? Are you overweight? No. Well, start working on it. I'll tell you about was the. The. Worth at the planet that you choose. You should be picking Jupiter or Pluto or Mars because Uranus is just a little too suggestive and I think that. That's the. So we get all of our petitions in like. Yeah, we ought to essentially Uranus. Yellow hat the weed on that. Okay. Okay. I enjoyed your show for a long time. Then you come on. I listen. All you science teaches out there. Watch it. Listen to the gentleman. He's got a good point. When you go up and show the kids the solar system on the map. Cover Uranus. Oh. Oh. Oh. Well, you cover. You better. Okay. Yeah. People listening and I get our petition. Good luck. Thank you sir. All right. We mean man is got to have. What? What is that mean? I give these messages on the screen. He's got to have.
