was you're like one the big prize was a stereo system are you kidding yeah it was a it was like a big box but he could carry it so i mean it couldn't have been how did he win it they picked his number you know i mean they you know man he probably people he slips somebody tend box or something but uh you didn't win anything good like little calculator but i love that he got and then they had like little church could gifts too you know like for everybody you want a stereo system that's right and somebody out there then there was a VCR and a CD player and i from the library that's all the stuff they gave away to different people yeah yeah it was exciting but i didn't win anything so i knew that you you made one day even you didn't hear them call your numbers i may have already been a winner okay shall we go to a phone call and see if we can get our levels up here this morning browner county hi hello hello oh your level sound great oh hi how are you doing great um listen i have two things to ask you want if anybody would know you would know okay have you ever saw on court society child janniceen it's always i'm trying to find it nobody even knew who it was a believe i knew that right off the top of my head i would say 1968 janniceen society's show right yeah janniceen okay i have one more thing i guess when you put the commercials on you really don't listen to them right sometimes i do and you know sometimes we have other things to do okay well there's a commercial that you put on to be an insurance and they say cheap insurance and they're too close and they're getting an accident no don't you know which one she told you about capinet oh boy how bad i was listening i'm checking the news okay anyway the next one of my moves in during oh yeah okay with when you get an accident they say you too animal they know he does know he's like good guy is like he's talking with a fake Spanish accent he's going you animals you would like you know like the way the Spanish say you so calm down okay do you believe him i i guess i think he's right yeah they wouldn't do that you and um it's a car insurance for Nazi generals that's what it is okay well you guys have a good day good to hear from you okay okay i'll go to a call from tape county hi yeah hi what's up are you awake yeah why is there a call captain that's an excellent question sorry do you know what i think the theory is i thought about this because he threw that at me the first day i worked with uh need i was that my last name is Capriita cap and it's that's just sort of your and that's like that was my father's name too was cap so i think he got like the cap from Capriita and just capinet but a cap from Samozi just remember sir it's not capinet it's capin capinet see a capinet oh they cap yeah there's a there's an apostrophe in there okay can you sleep well now no i have a little critique um when is it too at the each of concert no i wasn't were either capinet no no sir oh it's disappointing and they were named the concert was disappointing yeah the base was 30 and that and that was inconsistent the what was inconsistent the edge the drumming was great i mean i didn't enjoy where is name why are you are you glad you went or would you oh glad i saw it because i never saw it before i just didn't know what it's seen in about five years ago when there are a bit younger and that's a commercial one would this happen to be a tom moon for the Miami-Herald sounds like a it sounds like one of those reviews that you read in the Herald i like the word you choose the base was rough and there's a little dirty it didn't come out the ampsi oh the base was dirty and the edge was rough oh i'm sorry i thought like a shaving foam and it's a too much of the new music yeah it's a you think do you think this was one of these deals where you your anticipation was just too much you thought it was going to be greater than you know it actually wasn't reality i see and they did they played you know this crap from the Joshua to say oh i see well that's a good arm don't you like that album jack that's not with the way such is made i'm looking for something is the worst and the song version the most by you two on the radio is the worst you two song heard now no why do you think that is it's the worst you two i'd prefer every you two song they've ever made it's the worst one is this bill a word okay all right see you later good to hear now we uh he was the only one everybody also they really live everybody loves the concert yeah but maybe they didn't notice that dirty base edge that people happen to discern properly from a seat we got another memo and this is not concerning us directly this is from Peter and i i i don't think Peter's up yet so i'm going to read it says at the bottom please don't talk about this memo on the air just do the promos you know so i'm going to do them from the bottom up i'll do like one an hour or something now as you do them it says john make log notations when needed when needed later i have to log this one i get one of these promos i mean one of these uh memo is it something i'll read it to you and you'll see if you want if you want to copy it the end of the show i'll get you one every weekday is now a no repeat work day on zeta four listen all day from nine to five never hear the same song twice just the best classic rock and roll the best of the new the best of the old now and they say nine to five you notice so if you hear anything from nine to ten you're probably not going to hear it the rest of the day which would keep me listening you see see how that goes date county high hello hello was the guy talking about dirty bass i think he should go back to bed and clean out his cobwebs he sounds like he should be in bed i think but do now come on now on to any ways i like the i like the Joshua tree what can i tell you i like that i'll man everyone said the concert was fine i love it hmm well it's Monday but uh we're

url this six sixteen zeta four and the new or i'm just showing now we do have the uh the uh and zeta four computer set up today now if if so one young lady wants to take a stab at this maybe early we

that's my weather here uses memo yeah yeah use the memo yeah all we need is your weight and your height and we will put it through there and and with this formula and i'm embarrassed to say that but what will come out will be your broad size and what we would like to do is see if it comes out accurately right how you're going to test this have them come buyers no no they'll just tell us well i have to have someone we can try so if you want if you want to take a stab at it you can can i give those a to 73 degrees warm morning well they're just uh blue the whole climate that's supposed to be

found that we're still we have not organized the car chat we still have this incredible stack of cars we've got to do that today I'm gonna do it today yeah and i found another one it says 30 something on it i'm gonna play that in a minute you don't have any idea what that is it's got to be a take off on the TV show alright we'll see what it is in a minute first let me take this call from bowered county hello hello hi hi how you doing okay i just want to tell you the Friday at work we have the formula on a whole bunch of different women there uh huh and it came within an inch on everybody except for one are you serious it's unbelievable it's unbelievable i'm unbelievable now what you do is you take now let let's go through it briefly alright you take the the you take the woman to wait and you multiply by what 549 then you take her height subtract 10 inches right so another she's 5 5 that would be 65 inches so then you so you take make it 55 divided into the number you got when you multiply and then take the square root of what you got correct all right now i said it right correct and it came he said it came out within an inch on every woman they tried in the office maybe we should do that to the women in our office here later today and then we'll give you a report tomorrow that's what thought it's normal I've worked it up what it did work yeah well thanks for the reports sir you're welcome thanks a lot alright bye bye all right now here's this card i found it all it says on it is 30 something next week on 30 something you really should eat something no now maybe later say what time is it not a no 7 something okay how about something chinese or something Italian something why no something well then maybe more you're something yeah something fun that'd be something 30 something to use a 10 something 9 something central it's really something oh yeah i remember that i've heard that in a long time so we're trying to clean out get this organization we're finding a lot of a lot of things we haven't played in a long time that's okay all right riches here who helps us out here are resident what mamerian mamerian he's got the computer there so someone wants to give it a shot on the formula he'll be more than thrilled to punish the buttons right punch the buttons in and let the computer calculate the the breast size and if they want to give their actual breast size we're going to accumulate the data and even reply let's say a standard deviation for all its deviates and maybe we can tweak the formula a little and come out with more precise more precise formula for this thing yeah we get our first victim here yeah we have it says on the screen a formula victim is on brown one so let's see what this is hello hi how are you doing this morning great are you a formula victim well i haven't considered myself as such until now well actually i was calling with regard to the formula uh-huh and i've always sitting here on hold i got to hear it sported sport whoever i didn't have my 10 in hand yet so all i thought is wait what's 549 and then height minus 10 that's correct all right now now what's your weight my weight yeah 118 hundred eighteen oh we went put it into the computer and how tall are you five six five six okay we're putting it in the in the computer now and the wrestling so the rest machine says that your brush size should be 34 34 there you go it's right on the mud and are you serious i can't believe this is working you believe the wonder is so funny i tell the society we live in today isn't it amazing right now we know the whole reason for all of the computers that we have well i am just amazed but i'm really kind of happy that it worked you know because we're haven't while i was trying to do it in my head you know last year and you know how i am what do you do to tell somebody's height away huh oh well i just uh my addition but what it what well i can't this square root to kind of get difficult you're here yeah try to do square root in your head it was just like virtually impossible at least you know within a few sentences of conversation yeah yeah you know when you first meet somebody and you're trying to decide that all up you know what's in guide i just wanted to say i'm enjoying you good yeah have a nice day thanks a lot okay well so now there's there's uh uh we tried it and it worked now we're doing now here's the altan over the engineer from uh can we say call you the am engineer we're doing a lot of important work here you altan yeah i'm sure we're working on the formula you know the formula or if you take a woman's weight of all the plant by 549 take her height subtract 10 inches and divide that into your number then you take the square root of that number and you get her bras size and we hit just had a collar and we do it we did it in computer and it worked beautifully you know some people put model airplanes together and figure out people's bras sizes well you're a breast of the time and if uncle neo comes back and find out and finds out that this is what we've been doing on his airwaves we're never we're never gonna hear the end of it trust me okay just one you thought crap call records couldn't possibly be more tasteless and a boy they believe and a clean down for Brooklyn and met this year counten give about to tardish move that's right it's the cat skills cowboy himself Dr Irving paycheck you singing the all-time greatest hits of not sure I still hear the account you gotta know how that beat him know how to cheat him if you're on a little good life keep a second sit up and who could forget this flavorful cut looking for laks in all their own places looking for laks I'd buy my vacation quality stuff be sure there's no cases a bones or to my soul and no collection of old country music would be complete without Dr Irving paycheck's dietary classic I was coach and then coach and pausin cool yes crap co-record proudly presents the all-time greatest hits of not sure those not my amymouth to order not sure hits dial 1 800 a six by Dr Irving paycheck cuz he's got those not my amymouth yeah yeah I had the north-manly blues one time boy those are bad okay now 628 now let's say the captain Dave is doing we can you describe for us just exactly what we're working with here this is impressive this is a compact three portable computer okay it's IBM compatible it has a 40 million bite hard drive that's a lot that's a lot okay 640 k of memory and it's got a 286 chip in there which means it's very fast and it only weighs about 10 pounds and you can carry it around the you know like a soaring you are talking into the back of that microphone AC if you turn it around it says front it's not you see that now try it now let's see what's there we go how's that now you're still now see the see the purple diamond there you go that's the front okay but it did sound kind of neat it made it sound like an engineer yeah it made it sound kind of you're in because we had the noise in the back of but anyway it did work is is the point when we tried it on the last listener we'll see if we can give it another shot here this morning sometime brown county high good morning good morning good morning listen is there anyway we could take that computer and use two pick numbers at highlight oh the formula if you will come on the running suggestion you get the breast size of the players but I don't know if you get the winner what do you say about that rich yes there there are there in fact there are some programs out there that you can buy that that do predict the winners at highlight and at the track I haven't seen any you know I haven't haven't tried any actually but they they just compile a lot of statistics and they're probably picking 50% of the time which is probably what you would do in our use series yeah that's what do you think it helps at all well you know they self-alike $59.69 a piece and you know if you if you're into that sort of stuff and you know you're afraid to stick a pin in an erasing form you know you give it a shot what do you think about that well I think I'll go with the breast size okay well thanks going you're doing an excellent job in Captain Dave and hopefully he'll make the fact before you take over yeah he'll be back don't worry okay thanks a lot thank you 630 and Zeta 4 you know now I see rich when you're trying to make you something before it was great when you're talking into the back because you had all this noise really sound like he was in a like an a you know a laboratory you know like a lab doing like experimenting yeah high tech it really good turn the mic back around yeah talking the back of the okay now Captain Dave you were talking to yelton about you you are just just apoplectic this morning because you left your calculator it's Christmas well I was in a half to leave why I was with this really lovely lady it's like the first date I've had since 79 would you like to tell us who it was is someone we know I don't want to do okay um I picked up the calculator and I made sure that I picked it up off the table because do you remember one time at love 94 the general manager gave us these little gold pins Christmas said love 94 you're paying to your shirt yeah no no that's not the one remember the time he gave us the gold chain yeah by the way I melted all of that down and I got a guy got a couple of bucks for that remember the gold chain sure he gave it to us we were out on the south beach location on south Miami Beach and I used to go to a gym on the way home in the omni that we had membership so I got this Christmas present of a beautiful gold chain that everybody got one at the station 30 minutes later I was at the gym took it off like an idiot hung up the locker and it was like this Christmas present was gone 30 minutes later and this is like deja damn boo that's exactly what they happened Saturday night man I had this beautiful Christmas present for 30 minutes and then it was gone well yelton said that you could get another when they have extra wins and all you'd have to do is go up to the bookkeeper and tell them that you're getting for glad what's the means you're left out in the little I don't get one anyway I don't really think I need one but well I don't either but they were so nice when they were a little clock in a little date thing on them and they were solar powered and they could figure out bros sizes and a leatherette case oh they were in a case oh they were solar powered I like to and a little note pen okay so if you would like if any if any young woman would like to or older woman it doesn't matter would like to take a chance we do have the computer here now we tried one experiment this morning and it worked perfectly so all you have to do is give us your weight and your height and all us guys here will do a little guide thing will give you your bros as we we're just curious if it's a character not that's all just sort of like an experiment like no like I asked Friday before we left this for the weekend is there a formula that women can get into we don't like the equivalent of this well see like Neil would love us if we did that but trust me we can't get into that this is the time of year would everyone do we bit Irish say Colleen would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me wax my shell alien oh now this I would not be Patrick if you beware in the green oh no there's a smart lussie please make ensure her that is wearing the Kelly Green Protection of Leppra Condom don't be wishing out of for this glory I'm falling for the gift to gab especially if you're planning on kissing some blondie stones and what have you been doubting your protection with different condoms they're strong enough for a man but I like them too so catch yourself a different condom and you won't be catching anything else Neil wakes me up in the morning Neil wakes me up with a smile new I can't believe that this is what we're doing in Christmas week, you know, it's not the only thing we're doing this week, just a thought rich drop by and he's got the computer but it is not the main a it's not the only thing we want to talk about so if there's something else you know we had to call her about the YouTube, all he wanted to hear the Elvis bits didn't he? Okay, let me let me play this and I'll go see if I can find that for him, all right you know. In accordance with the new FCC guidelines, this station will broadcast material characterized as indesense only between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. the time of the tone 12 midnight 636 I cannot

is yeah that I know what this is as this is Elvis Junior let me look and see if I can find it he was the Elvis comedy bit right he was like really uncoheering anyway he's probably twilight unconscious by now let me look anyway yeah all right okay I found it here's what he wanted this is the Elvis comedy tapes which is something else I don't think Neil plays much anymore and that's what we're rolling for you this week a lot your body's record you've seen his film you'll even purchase the day global memorial paintings of the gas station as a true Elvis fan you think you've heard it all but

started talking to me okay we're gonna put you in the computer just curious yeah you come out in the actual computer okay okay now how much do you weigh one thirty five put in one thirty five five and she's five feet tall and let's see how this comes out I don't know how you can stand up straight my dear he says he doesn't know how you can stand up straight okay brush size says the computer says oh I I used to twist wait thirty eight the computer says thirty eight okay now breastfeeding you go up a couple sizes so that would be right so it is right in other words you say are you saying it's correct it's probably otherwise four forty deal long time oh yeah remember she told us this last week she's a forty D but there are some people that's like this because I have a friend that's only five four if she weighs one twenty okay now we're gonna put her in the computer okay well we're gonna see what this comes out okay five foot four 120 I'm gonna come to have to thirty five thirty five no well thirty five is nothing to sneeze that so to speak her cup of runith over oh she just begged me is she really yeah well you guys are must be exceptions to the to the formula well no my whole family's like that oh are they yeah you inherited it and and John there you know someone from she did I used to work there a few years ago you used to work at she I was up at three years he was the
