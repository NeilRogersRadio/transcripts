Parts of number 82. We'll look for the pink one. Give it to clearance. Let him drop it on the line. I don't. Clarets has that country. Lest in traffic this month. You're need deep to our hip boots in traffic today. We'll opt to it. They destroyed this showday. They've done it to me again. Can you believe it? I think it calls for lawsuit. I really do. I'm sitting here. I think we ought to discuss this. But they continue interfering with my ability to go on the air and just be myself, which is why for months now it's so psychotic. Because or nearly I'm just a half a sleep all the time. But when you come in here, they mess with their weight gap in here. They mung with your brain. They're this building. A lot of snorles. That was the most emotional thing Jeff has said. And now he has been in the building. Boy, is he a powerhouse, a dynamo, a dynamo. One of the movers and shakers at WI and Z. A very few people in the country who can handle those CBS memos with the player. Boy. Moving right along. Oh, come down. Nine to go. I should have given one of that first broad they called here. Just a bother first bag. Yeah. Are you gay? I heard it and why I won a hundred. I can't believe they're talking about that. On why I won a hundred. Why not? They don't know what else to talk about. I guess. They just want to get the island queen listening over there. Oh, I see. Well, that'll do it. Maybe they'll have to bring one of their former morning people back. Well, we don't want to get into that. They're rumours about that. Yeah. But I think to get that crowd again. Where's the poster? The mail came speaking of the island queen. Where is my wall size? Jeff Stryker poster, which didn't show up again. Can I? And there'll be no more mail till Monday. That's our right Brian's working the night at the ice cream. He is. Okay. Now we go to. Yeah. That's the one. Stayed County. Hey, good morning. I'll go. How you doing? All right. Okay. I'll go. I'll go. Well, a big news story today has to do with just record. What? I'm not kidding you. You open up the front page. Okay. And you know the new police switch is on. Well, we have CC has approved the film. I don't know. We've done a four. It's going to be selling it. They go up. But you see what Popton do is head when he went. This is one of the problems of listening to this show. I know. I'm not mine. I don't know where it's heading. You don't do it to you. I'm going down. Yeah. Yeah. If you also got a page 15A, there's been a lawsuit concerning the sleeve bag. The use of the word. Yeah. We saw it. Yep. I like the term is too slippery to be a fact. One can grasp. Yeah. Hold up to the ramp of the tree. So it's legal to call someone a sleeve bag. It's like sunny fox. You're a sleeves bag, sunny. That's legal and a slime ball. And a banana mouth. I hear doe's bag is up the next case. Yeah. We'll get a ruling on that next. Yeah. It was Pond Beach Circuit Court. All right. That was an Uva killed enough time for now. Guess you want one of these albums, right? Thank you. I call it for. I'm sure that. Mojo Nixon and Skid Roper, who are probably the epitome of this entire program. Okay. Here he go. Just pick up the old phone there and do another 30 seconds worth of very hard work. Look at him. Boy, just got that pin poised. No, last name. We are asking the ages of the callers today. Are we? No. That's not to do it. That's not to push our lives. That was too days ago. We had Wednesday. The perfect demographics. And all the callers sounded like they had night. United course was in Tugas today when Kyle was very nasty to the callers. And that kind of changed the entire call on X. Although yesterday we only, what do we have? We did Tom Jippy yesterday. How could there have been a crisis with Jika? Well, with his crisis. With his office. One wouldn't. With the station. Not talking about that one. I'm talking about the one upstairs with the phone. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That happened. Yeah. Pretty unlikely. The only crisis is when the transmitter opened up to the red sea. Kyle went back there and stuck his finger in it and saved it from drowning in the liquidity. Yeah. A real zets. A stooch in the back. From our psychotic engineering and programming departments. You can't do that. Just can't do that. We're talking to these people. You can't do that. They do the believe it. Can't they leave us alone? Should we, should we have some kind of an endurance contest to see just how many days they could go? And just leave us alone. Not interfere. No memos. No messages. No hostility. No snows. No snarrow. No nothing. How long do you think they could do that? I'd like to see. I'm now. Ha ha ha. Shame on you. Wash your brains out with chlorox. 26 till noon. A WINZ. And what's going to come down to? If Gary ever does come back because he's off to New York again today. I'll tell you. If he's got gone. He's been in here the last few weeks. Very little. Have you noticed that? About three days. Right. And some of the days. Not the whole day. I tell. And we seem to be, you know, surviving and rolling along. So he said this morning was going on strike. He came in here and he's going on strike. But if he shows up, if he shows up, we are going to tell him we. Yes, we. We don't do the show unless Kyle answers the phone. I agree. Yeah. I agree with. It's a simple as that. I support that 100. Absolutely. We're on the record right here. And if they want to bring somebody some other. They want to bring hermen and McBeans in here. Do that. No problem. No problem. Go out. You know, as long as the paycheck keeps coming every other Friday. For a minute. No problem. They can bring Lee Ann Ingles in here. With the children book a lot of guess. You wish singles introduction the first day. Would play a lean. Yeah. That would get about a one. No. Not even close. Hello. Hello. 24. Till noon at WI and Z. We're going to take another commercial break. We still have eight albums to go. We might stretch that. I'd tell you. I'll tell you that. Also have to be darling Ross to the front of the line. I'll tell you that. Twenty-two mid-Bed at WI and Z. And all in his way of money. Twenty-two mid-Bed night. Twenty-two mid-Bed night. Right. Okay. We're back to in the night show, which means in 20 minutes. I can go home. Bill Calder will be exactly. Okay. Let's go back. Well, I'm confused today. I'm very confused because it hurt. I have all of this stuff going on around this. We've had a winter and a winter. Last night was days. So probably time to go back to Broward and say it's a good time. I'm for. Hello. Hello. How you doing? How you doing? Yeah. You're saying that was a good moment. Well, I'm very sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm sorry. No, I can't do anything. I can't change now. It's too late. Okay. After those first two calls, I don't think. You know, after three hours of that. Right. You'd better. And those were some of the nice ones. Oh, my gosh. I'd love to see old Mark Killing come up here and answer the phones while they're waiting at a nice idea. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I can just see that. The audience would be revolting. More so than you. So I guess you want one of the albums, huh? Oh, sure, right now. Yeah. Of course. I mean, you probably really call because you wanted to say hi to us, but. Oh, it's a place I'm, uh, I've got to go and try to find out. Wow. What's probably a slow day, you know? Yeah. First time you got through and you got a prize. That's great. One a day. Yeah. That's something you wanted to get rid of. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Okay. Well, y'all hold on now. Okay. Thank you. And the friend of phone. Would you please? What are you? Okay. They were capable of throwing the album on a pile. Eries, grab an albums and brook shields, pick your ear and totally out of control. This bird, this nerd, totally out of control. This nerd brain that we're saddled with here. It's a good time for the great taste. But it could be worse. They got it. It could be a lot worse. Oh, that was quick. Papino. Really? I wonder if he knows Dr. Hefford. Oh, that's slow the taste down a little bit. Was that the great description of him? Let's pretend it's the Stan Meadier show. Let's slow the taste down. Oh, good. I can't do it. Can't do it. Can't do it. Only kidding Stan, I don't get excited. I don't get excited. I don't get excited. I don't get excited. You know, since he saw that, I love she was thinking the tobacco shop at the Broward Mall. Oh, boy. He's not joking. He put his head in his hand. I'm talking about the head of his shoulders. He put his head in his hands. He's just going to be kind of slumped on the end of the counter. Thank goodness. This young lady was, she was walking in the other direction. He was like on the way out. And he just was sobbing and moaning. Making guttle sounds on the end of the counter. And I said, that's why I got him out of there real quick. I was embarrassed. I think God you were there. Yeah. This is absolutely true. I know this every person said yesterday that he doesn't, I don't know how close he came to asking me to just go on without him. He would have walked home from the Broward Mall. Probably with a stop at Windixie on the way. Well, what was, what would it take you know? What was it? How did he had to do a say go ahead? I could have spent a few more minutes up there with Josh and my good friend. But he Mac and Volio. What was it about this girl? She was good. She was hot. Mm-hmm. And she had scanty clothing. Very scanty clothing. Oh, wow. You know, one of those were the purpose of hanging out. And I almost all of the body parts are just like, you know, she was, but now I understand. A little old for Stan though. She must have been about 20. About 20, 20s. Pretty old. I think pushing the auto limits. No kid, but she was good. Okay. Brooks getting, she's about out of range. Now why is it that when Brooks Shields was 14? It's okay if like a 50 year old guy would call one of these shows. And the bar had sure liked to get to know that Brooks Shield. Well, you know, that would be okay. But for example, if you came on and said that you'd like to get to know river Phoenix. It's our society. You know, is he just, is this, no, it's our society. I'm trying to answer it. You'd like to get to know river Phoenix. No, no. Well, my tie. I would. Always not your tie. No. Ah. Ah. Ah. Maybe we ought to explore that a little before we give away our next album. I'd like to talk to River. He's a good. Yeah. Nice. Very good. I got a little chat. Sure. Talk about his sister Rainbow. Yeah. I love his parents. And his parents. Yeah. His parents. And their, and their naming practices. I'd like that a little discuss with River out his parents. Yeah. Yeah. Two son and flags. They're human names. They're kids. They're names. I'd like to talk to the parents. And ask them, you know, what they're trying to do here. Rainbow. And River. River. River. River is wide. River is deep. River. Marvin. Marvin gay? Yes. No. Sorry. I'm thinking of something else. Obviously. The river is wide. The river is deep. Thinking of something else. I can't. I can't. I can't place it in my head. The river is wide. The river is deep. This is an old curse one song. What? Marvin's gay. No. I guess not. I guess it wasn't Motown. It's not in the rack. That rack is on the rack, isn't it? Just relax. Okay. When you want something in that rack. No. You're possible. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. When you want something in that rack. No. You're possible. Okay. I've got a lot of add-on. All the good stuff stands as erased. So we could put add-on all the cards. If every record is clear. Okay. What do we do next? That was Brower. Yeah. So dates. Hello. They'd count. Speak to us. Neo. Yes sir. Incredible. I will bow to pick with Mr. Glenn there. Oh good. Perfect day for it. Glenn, remember the day you gave Bobby the football ticket? Sure. I was the second call. Oh. And Bobby never used them. Sir, I did the best I could. But my heart was in the right place. Wait a minute. This isn't the guy we give the U of M tickets to. No. No. This guy called the Fright after Bobby. I was trying to be a good guy. You know, Bobby had done a lot of work force. Mail that a lot of, uh, Pope bumper stickers and stuff like that. I can understand. He had a good. He don't apologize anymore. No. No. Not apologizing. But you know, he had a good story. He had never been to a football game live. And it would have been great if he could have gone. But, uh. But he blew it. Yeah. He blew it. And, uh, you know, we won't repeat that mistake again. Kyle, I like to apologize for all the other idiots to call in. Ha ha ha ha. The dirty abuse. True. True. Okay. You won't want to these albums. I want to appreciate it. Okay. Anything else on your mind? No doubt. I'll do it. And Neil, don't worry about the bureaucrats. They'll get off your back. They will. Eventually. Eventually. He had one way or the other, right? Yeah. What's it you call from? I'm calling on a day line, but I'm calling from Pomp and I'll be. Oh boy, this is two Pomp and I'll winters in a row. What is going on in Pomp and I'll today? Good day. What a great day. Ha ha ha ha. Have you visited her friend Dr. Hapero lately up there? Oh, and I don't play it on it either. I hear he's all heard. Ha ha ha ha ha. Okay. Pick him up and get him out of my life. Will you play? Crab minutes till noon. I can't find Marvin Gaye. Can you believe that? Who's in the rack? I'm a dress. It's gone. Spell it. That's Stan Boy, what an organizer. He's beyond belief. Okay, let's take another break. What have we done? Is this the fourth one only? Yeah. Oh, we can stretch this till two o'clock easy. What a hood, Donald. I bet you want to power. I'm sure there's a making you. Okay. I guess it's a last line in the crowd. We take him. There might even be somebody there who's not. Good time for that great day. I guess you just disqualified yourself, sir. Oh no. Really? No. Do you hear what I was on with Steve? Yeah. I was on with Steve. Yeah. I was on with Steve. I was on with Steve. I was on the Tinder box. No. The girl says he knows her. Oh. It's a good time for the great beast. How are you to qualify? Yeah. Say a lot of spend on those. How can she be? I missed the opening of your show. What are you so upset about? We don't want to rehash. It's just more hassle from the bureaucrats all over the building. They're all upset because Kyle is nice to the callers. They want them to be. And he told somebody to stick it up their ear. And they're having a nervous breakdown again. Because they like to take little problems and magnify them. They did gigantic problems and write memos. And they all like to power and you're the water fountain. And you're the water fountain with Richard. And of course they always agree with each other. You're a crats, always suck each other's rear. And they all get together. And it's like it's us against them. Us against them. It's us like to play that work with. I don't want to get emotional again. But it's us against them. The talent. Those terrible. More current. Yeah. That's a good idea. How do you do in a mar. I like to know. No, I don't mean you. Well, I had planned to take the day off. Well, I'm going to be able to keep it open. Yeah. I'm going to know that breakfasted burger thing. Just about put me into. I've got such heartburn from that cramp. Have you eaten any of those bagels that they got a burger king? No way. Ever since I saw the bird dropping out. Many burgers. Oh, yeah. Well, a bird in a spare time. He put the put those together for burger king. Yeah. The. The. The. The. The. You know. What do you mean by that? Well, he's not on the field. No more like in. Now, a old smelly pitch doesn't want to be there. Well, I can. I couldn't stand with the Trump East Sunday. So I turned on a. Trump. Trump is truly obnoxious. And they. Yeah. A little bias. I think not only that. But he never shuts his damn mouth. Man. He runs off at the mouth. And. I'm. Anyway, I want to be a leader in the new guy. They got on the field at the end of rough to the Rick. Isn't that Brian Robby? No, it's another guy. Some new guy. And I don't know who the hell he is. Anyway, Rick. I will accept because he was going to say the station ID. He goes well. I wasn't going to say the station ID. But I don't have to do that after the break. So he gets a little obnoxious at times. Yeah. Well, Rick is just got a little ego. You know, just a tiny one. I'm going to send him some exercise of tubby boots. Anyway, you're going to send it over to you. You're going to send it over to you. Don't want the album. I do. I know you got other calls. Always wanted to hear what you were going to send Rick. Whatever his name is. Bar a coast. Right. He started to say you're going to send him something. You're going to send him either. So. You're going to send him either to the ivory coast or a bar of ivory and cause of one of the other. Yeah. I'm just going to end this like this. What if the million talk house does?

We are given away in case you joined us late five about 10 copies. We are 5 to go of mojo nicks and end skid brokers. No. Have a new album. Please. Me. Okay.

Well Jeff, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything, is that what you're saying? Well you know you can't be in a go into the kitchen because you had all that change. And I got one of these sandwiches, one of these mong sandwiches out of our machine. And what's says, what have a sandwich named this? I mean I've heard of Ruben Sandwich, Royals Choice, and in Little Prennitz, there's Fidthier Aquine. So why would you choose that one? Well, is it sort of like betting on a horse? I didn't want it as a point, any point. Because I didn't want it as a point, sunny fox. Yeah, the horse named Dieke. He's so upset about those who almost sex with. Especially the ones he works with. Yeah, the brand of cards, they send over to this stage. Yeah. Well question, just a typical card that you'd expect everybody to go out and get as a greeting card. Keep them coming. Okay, we have five more albums to give away. We're under real direct now because the bureaucrats are out to lunch together. I saw them hand in hand, Arm and Arm, with their suits on. Well, they're three piece Birch Brothers suits that ties. Wow. That was really impressed. This means we can do anything. You know, I even tucked my shirt in there because I was so impressed. I got a Gary's in New York. Yeah. The bureaucrats are out to lunch. We can do anything. Are they out eating freebies probably? Oh, I'm a bunch of old. Absolutely. No, I think we can do anything. I think Tim Williams is still in his office. He wasn't speaking to me, give me a dirty look. But the boss's son, the owner's son is in his office. So we're in trouble still. Really? We've got to mind our peace and cues. All right. Because he's not his fond of this show as he used to be. He's turned on me. Really? I don't know. But I just decided good. Well, that's what Lanceter would say. You know, they all hate you. They hate you. And what he just understand, they all hate him. Because he's so morbid and depressing. By the way, speaking of Bob Lanceter. Another rumor? No. And I cannot tell you any details. I don't hear him at all. Is his mic off? It's not working. Is it working? Hello. Testing one, two. Testing. This is a test. I have a net 60 hour. This station will conduct a test. Unfortunately, it's on. Of the emergency bureaucrat system. That's what the, unfortunately, it's working. It's on. These are sturdy. These mics. Let me show you how it's doing. Let me bang one against the side of the board a couple of times. I love the way that sounds on the air when you do that. It sounds good. Oh, great. These electrosmikes. Do they sound good when you go? Oh, there's. There's Jimmy. What's Jimmy? Service about fix it. Maybe we can get some of the good mics that are lying around on the floor up on the FN from your month. Long-brain counterpart on FN engineering up there. Mr. Van Schnook. Now, the we asked much. Yeah. What was he doing for us? So we went. You know, just saw we want is one noise. Like Leonard Neumann. Now, what were you about to say before they shut your mic off? We have the sandwich is long city. And you notice I've started eating again this morning. I've been eating just one bite. I didn't eat this. I didn't eat this. It ate a bag of, got me wound up like an alarm clock now. I've been eating since you've been in the building. That 85 memos all running around. I've heard do this again. Not to me. To Kyle. They got nasty memos. How can you take that big paycheck and have a clear conscience? That you had to go on welfare just to give you that 40 cent of week raise. It's true. He had a drown in one of his children. Just to pay Kyle. And now Kyle turns on him. And call some miserable nasty old fart. A miserable nasty old fart. Shame on you. I think Kyle thought he was just stating facts. When he was talking to that person. He was just the fact. Just the facts. This sandwich. Boy. A friend of this show. In the business. We still have one. Yeah. We have a couple. Not in the building. No. You notice they're all hostile. Now even inside the building. Like Roste used to bring us the mail. Because we don't get any mail anymore. But that's only since I came back from vacation after you blew away the audience. It's nice to get cartons. Remember that carton is full of mail every day. Now we're lucky if we get three pieces of mail. And two of them are from like public service. You know, or this kind of stuff. It's doctor that went on the show. He booked himself on the show. He must have been talking to Lee. He booked himself on the show. No. He would love to come on the show. Well, if you'd like to be a guest on the show, call Lee and Engel. At the state of Florida unemployment office. Yeah. That's where you can find it. Boy, if I got hurt for now. A friend of the show at another radio station knows someone who works at WFLA. And there this is the Bob Lazarus story. Yeah. They're going to work on getting us some outtakes from production and stuff. Well, I can't wait. Yeah. And we only want to tip our hand. Because you know, Bob has his spies listening. Yeah. He'll know this within 10 seconds. Yeah. So I give no details. But we're working on that. Serobtitiously. Set the right word. No. It's word I pick up from. Then I'll get home and there'll be a message from last hit around my phone. Hey, Bob. Yeah. That is Bob. He always calls you, but I'd recognize that be pressing voice anywhere. And stay away from Dave Murray while you're over there too, will ya? The amount of the same state? Yeah. Nobody keeps hanging around. Yeah. Look out. Bob, it will be up to number six. That's right. We only got five to go. Am I right? Mm-hmm. Yes, you are. Trying to see what Caldy we give the last discussion. You're sitting here with a worm dangling from his beat. Oh, blast County was sour. D'Orets. So that means we go back to death. Casey, can some come on. Yeah, well, a little countdown. Number six this week. Hello, the police, which you do so well. Name the address. Yeah, are you foreigners at Miami Day, by the way? Bug off. You know what I'm saying? What do you know about American radio? Radio free Argentine, maybe they remember, from that great, okay. From Eva Perone, I think. Miami? Are you getting these right? Are you just making these up? Okay. See what he does is he makes up all the names and dresses. Put them on his sheet. They take all the albums home. And then we stuck in all these calls. I never got my album, never got my jacket. Probably opening up a Neil Rogers trinket stool. And then we'll be the story. Uncle Delo, and that day comes when you need something to fall back on like in October. Yes, well, they're teen. If you want to see, we're going to take another commercial break. We still have what? For the go. Right. Boy, are we milking this or what? Not my type. Not anybody's type. That stands problem. Come on. Did you just come? No. Okay. Later. Bubble. Ha ha ha. I didn't hit my head. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Most of the names are choked up. Yeah. For a minute. You get the most five minutes. After we leave the, Oh, wait a minute. Now, I must do, even though I'm not going to do the show, I was going to do today because the bureaucrats here got us all really upset. Peot, BS, and BM. But other than that, I do have to mention because I started to mention it yesterday when Gico was here. Tom Jitka. Yeah. As some idiot, I know what to say. Tom Ziggas. Ha ha ha. Tom. Don't you have any shame at all? I mean, is there, is there nothing that anyone could say or that you could do that would be mean you make you look in the mirror and think, oh, be a little bit like that. And nothing? Why would I be here if they were true? Why would you be doing what you do if they're what? Exactly. Ha ha ha. Anyway, Gico is here yesterday and I didn't have time to get into it at length. But I wanted to make a special announcement to all the morons who work at the salad scene in the Broward Mall. You know what the patio is? And right on the corner is the place where they sell like juices and a fruit, pardon the expression and salad and all that stuff. Food court. You couldn't get weighted on there if your life depended on it. Okay? You couldn't get weighted on there if you were starving to death. And I've had this happen so many times. What have we designed to do this great honor? Put away the birch. Will you please Dave? What has he got here? Uh-oh. This is from Dave Caprita on the FM. If it's as good as what he brought us yesterday. Or get it. You know what I mean? Hey, we're killing him in the birch, man. We got a number. I love that time birch, man. He picks him out of a hat. He just picks the numbers out of a hat. Now, for nature lovers everywhere, it's the collection you've been waiting for. The national Autobahn Society presents the sounds of the bird. Yes, feel your home with a wide variety of species that will charm you and your friends. Enjoy such gems. Oh, yeah. Well, he redeemed himself. Yes, he did. He did it. Well, it was good. Thanks for the hysterical. Yeah. And all true. Uh, we're all at the end.
