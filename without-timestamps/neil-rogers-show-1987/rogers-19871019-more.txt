beautiful and wonderful and lovely and also underage should just want yourself. Okay, 550 9490 we do have a line open and brown and of course we never know if these people can get through or not because of this wonderful phone system too. We don't want to bitch about that every day. Most days but not every day. I'm going to save that hate letter for a little bit later when more people are listening because it's too good to pass up. And we have some new little little things today that Dennis Collins will get upset about. When was this? Yeah, it was four. I'm a little bit older. I'm talking about these Zeta Studios. I'm going to say when I'm waiting, I'm not sure if it's horrible or it's going to happen. It's a 90 4.9, Zeta 4. It's six, I did it for the morning to discuss the show of the new Rogers. The best touch show of the world. You think I'm going to be a good life. Simple as switching Zeta 4. It relaxes. It's incredible. It's incredible. I got it. I got it. Did he say really like something like that? I see there's a lot of carpeting still out there in a hallway that hasn't been laid yet. Have you noticed that? That hasn't been what? They may be back today. The carpeting crew may be back today. And of course you're hoping not. I'm sure that. Okay. This collar in date was there for a long time. Am I right? Oh, look at that. I keep looking around and it's like on the screen now. What what a what a show this is turning into. All right. Yeah. Dave County. Good morning. Good morning. Neil. Yes. Welcome, my friend. Keep those levels up. Good morning, world. Yes. Welcome to my. You joined us. Yeah. Hey, Tiger. Maybe we can cut up a couple of jacks. Pants. How few trains? Bruce. This is Bruce. Why? It's a recognizable. Who's that? Yeah. What's up, Bruce? Well, it's real fun. The apparel. I don't know if I'm going to be able to make it to work this morning. So I'll have to listen to you all the way to a clock. Great. Is this hit? Is this our. This is our call the morning? You're right. The Dolphin Syndrome setting in again. I thought. Okay. This is by Bruce. I'm going to start me an asking cut in some of these people. I was terrible. I was off. I tried to warn you. You didn't want to hear. You're right. They're very depressed. Look at that. It's like only like last week. We never had to give the number out, right? But we've been through this before on the end. Yeah. And you're right. And I'm absolutely wrong with the Dolphin's pull off a particularly depressing performance 48 hours worth of dolphins. I know it doesn't matter. They were impostered and I got this for you having to listen to Mar Albert and Joe name. I mean, Joe has set new lows in the history of literacy. Okay. He just anywhere with the letter L in it. I wonder if they got him in Tom Brocott together to do the game. What would happen? I mean, it is just pathetic. Okay. And that Bokaline is also dormant. I see the other people are staring to pick up a little bit while I sleep it in a little late. It's Monday. I told you. Speaking of Monday, by the way, we also have another thing in the mail, which you're going to be very excited about. It's a recipe. You know, it's four four mong beans sprout salad, which will be reading a little bit later on. In fact, Marina Pulve is going to be here to lay that one on you. Look at that. What's happening with the phone this morning, Captain Dave, they're just a little cranky. He just shake it as he doesn't know. It's all over. He said you had one week in your finish. You know, that's it. Just like on a AM, man. I'm telling you the beginning. They give you that little Paul sense of security and that's it. They'll be this way for 48 hours. They'll all be back by Wednesday. I think they're uptight and unfriendly if you ask me. And like now, I feel great. You know, I feel like comfortable in here and even some of the stuff is working, not most of it, but you know, little bits and pieces. So you're pulling for the other team in the series, not the birds of what Minnesota or whatever the other team is. The Minnesota North Stars. What do you know about the goal? You can tell them any name. You know, how the North stars go. Yeah, the goal is a little sick, but the catchers, so he's going to come for the. Okay. Let's take one or two of these call and, uh, Brower. Hello. Good morning. Yes, Sarah. I hope you're going to be our first good caller this morning. Well, I hope so. I just got back here today from a two week holiday and I don't know what's going on, really. What do you mean by that? Well, I just got back from Europe. I left to week. So Friday. Are you trying to impress us with that? I mean, like, you know, you were in Europe and we were here. No, no. I could have said I was in Pioria, but I was gone for two weeks. Yeah. I turn on and, uh, here we are. And here we are. But, uh, what happened? You went to for me and FM. I know you're talking about it and, uh, all of a sudden, it's happened. Yes, it's happened. Here we are. I mean, like magic. Well, not like magic. Oh, yeah. I'm now now that you're going. Is it going to fall apart? Oh, speak it in the A M, by the way. They're running a promo. I'm glad you mentioned that because they're running the most ridiculous disgusting promo that says, and I'm paraphrasing, but it says, uh, join the crowd of FM listeners switching to A M, two to the 940, W. I and say, well, of course, what she forgets the T, lady forgets to say is that that strong of FM listeners will listen to my show. Yeah. And buzzing and our computer just went out by the way, Captain David. It was nice for 15 minutes. Haha. Yeah, we're here, sir. And you found this with no problem. You were away for two weeks. Now, how did you, uh, stumble on us? Well, I caught a friend yesterday to find out what was going on at work. And the friend says, by the way, he owns on FM. And I said, yeah, but time and why if you said 6 AM, I said, you won't get up at 6 AM. No, no, you'll get up at 4 AM, sir. I can't believe you're doing this. Sorry to believe you. You get up sorely in the morning and get with it and feel free. It's very, very easy. You set the alarm clock to get up. You got a bad shave. You get dressed. You do a couple other little goodies. Get in the car. Here you are. Just like magic. I keep saying that. That's we're not supposed to say magic anymore. Look, can you get up on some of the things that we're going on when I left? Like what? Did you ever go for Lazagna? No, for real-permous monster. Would you get it right? Oh, Jamie and Marcy are now on a work release program in Kendall and when they get out, we may get over to their house. Okay. Are you still in 976? Kick. Well, the problem is when they get us some real phones in here, we may be able to dial out. Okay. We can't. I was one that stopped by to see you at E. Mac and Bollyos at night and dropped off the picture. Then the Tory is pictured at your rear to the hour on the next day of what? Oh, Mr. Someone at the Copa. Oh, yeah. Well, we made that legendary. We've made 4,000 copies and passed it over Dayton Brown. What a picture. Yeah. Are you mailing them out too? Like you did. No, it's just a joke. It's just a joke. We talked about it on the year. We made sure everybody got the message. All right. Well, I told you. I'm glad you're on FM now. Okay. I'm glad you discovered us. We hope you had a wonderful time in Europe, but don't talk to us about it again. Okay. Mr. Thank you. Is that a matter of fact that picture of Allison Barry Manolo at the Copa together with smashing? That was one of my favorites. 550 94 90 and I'm starting to get a little pissed here this morning because it's obvious that what I said right at the beginning was true. What? We had like a honeymoon the first week now. It's in the dolphin game. Well, you see it's not all to do with you though. No, you see. They just get surly. They've always got an excuse, but that's the kind of town it is. Uptight and unfriendly. Welcome to South Florida. That is gentlemen. Put your gun in your holester and have a wonderful day. Okay. Let's go to all the computer screen. Is that? Look at that. He's bad. What happened to it? It just died? Yeah. It just died. I thought it was a joke. I thought maybe he shut it off for a second or something. It's dead. I want to tell you. The engineering staff at this radio station at a scale of zero. Okay. Let's go back to Dave County. Hello. Good morning. Hey. Look at that. Even the phone works today. Great. That's a good start. How are you? Wonderful. So what's happening here? Then we're going to... What exactly is the deal with Iran? Where we were? Oh, come. I don't start with Iran. When you're pleased, we don't discuss this as FM. We talk about happy things like Michael Jackson's face lift and stuff like that. We don't talk about the Iran. I heard you mentioned it briefly there. And Ronald Reagan, we don't discuss those things. We've got a bunch of mindless automatones out there. As somebody I know would say. Yeah. The news is morning we'll concern Don Johnson. Yep. Shooting pigeons. Stand by me. River Phoenix is 17th birthday coming up. Stuff like that. Yeah. And if they blow up the world, what difference will it make anyway, right? I can't a couple of points. It's just afternoon. I'd like to make. Well, and if you don't make them, what difference will it make? Nobody will ever know. Well, I'll be the bonds of the bursting in air. All right. Well, it's getting here on FM. You don't sound too enthusiastic this morning. Sound a little tentative. Like maybe this. Yeah, I'm very tentative. This is the only thing that's going to get me on. No, no, no. Now listen, we don't want you to get depressed. A little later this hour, though. We are playing a Peter Paul and Mary in the very last day. That's what we want. We want to hear it. Okay. Have a wonderful day. And listen, make the best of it. You know? All right. You know why? Why not? It could be the last one, right? Yeah. Okay. Wonderful day. We want to motivate everybody in the audience. We don't want to create chaos or panic. But this probably is the last day. And it's been nice knowing all of you. You know, but nothing is permanent, right? Right. Look at the dinosaurs. What happened to them? But we enjoyed. Yeah. We enjoyed our weekend one day on Zeta. And it has to come to an end. Now we go out in a flourish of glory and excitement and enthusiasm. Yeah. All those. Broward County. Good morning. Hey, uh, how can you even sell my last week? Okay. Where were we going next? I'll show you people a thing you're too okay. No more of that crap. Okay. We're going to start hanging up on everybody. We'll get a lot more calls in that way. That's right. Okay. If there's any, uh, you morons from Piper High or Miramar High, we need to make up with that member. Never say goodbye by Bon Jovi or the principal who's a real idiot over there. Oh, yeah. And they wanted to play it at the senior prom and you censored the record. They couldn't play it. And they had to play like Mary has a little lamb or something. And they ended up playing standby me or something like that. Are you serious? And I was considered. No, they considered the last night on HBO. That's right. River Phoenix. I saw the Parma Phoenix turned nine. You've been talking about that. 15-minute from my finally saw that. And at the very end of it, we're at fades out where they're starting to amolest each other. That's my favorite part. I can't believe that. That was great. You know, early. As I look back at it, I think this is one of my favorite movies of the 80s. I'm serious. This movie affected me. What is the word beyond obsessed? There must be some word in the dictionary that makes obsessed pale into insignificant. Because whatever it is, that's you. You are way beyond obsessed with that movie. Those dumb little kids. And you know, it's like everybody growing up in the 50s. We're already around looking at dead bodies and you know, jumping off railroad trestles and stuff like that. That's what life was on about. Jump off railroad trestles. Sure. I had leaches all over by body all the time. It was a common place grown-ups in upstate New York, like you know who. By the way, probably part of the reason the lines maybe a little jam this morning. Joey is taking a contest. They're having a big giveaway over there. Who can pick the date when he's going to get canned? And no dates after January 1st, 88 by the way. Well, just a little helpful hint to our listeners. Interesting. Okay. Captain Ava's put the board down. You know, the screen doesn't work and that hell with all this business. We don't care. We'll just put you up at random. Broward County. Good morning. Morning. Hi. Hi. I'm from South Plantation. And you said last week that, um, isn't that where the kids were counterfeiting that money? Yes. Yeah. I'm sorry to bring that up. That was a sore point. Well, I wasn't a counterfender. Okay. Really? Yeah. Um, we're not on one. I've been listening to you so since you've been on the air. So what were you doing? Wait a minute. When did I ever say South Plantation kids were more as I thought? That they could be South Kid did call. Oh, I love South Plantation. Hi. It's my favorite. I do. Isn't that the one that's got like the soccer ball on the thing? They were the state champions right? Yeah. We love them. You're going to listen to a nice call? No. No. I lived in the frigid north in Rochester. I was only on the westchester. In westchester? Westchester. Westchester? What? Florida? Westchester? New York. Oh, in Long Island. Now on the other side. What do you mean on the other side of the city? Westchester, currently. It was closer to a girl that's Connecticut. Oh, okay. I don't know that much about, uh, you know, other than Manhattan and the Bronx, that's enough for me. Okay. Well, I'm pleased. I'm enjoying it. And if I were all in, okay, have a wonderful day. Now, wait a minute. Let me ask you this. Do, uh, does anybody get your high school listen to this show? I'll listen to station, but that would have been unfair. I'm sorry. I honestly don't know. I'm my friend. So I take up a new one. But, you know, that's not because it's a good start. No, but that's a good start. That's a good start. Well, ask around. Yeah. Okay. She would you can find out and report back. Okay. Have a great day. Bye. Great. And Dave says you get a lot of hangups today. A lot of little cranky types out there in this Monday. You're right. It does happen after the dolphin that's right. This town just goes bananas. You go into a restaurant on the funswoods. Yeah. Waders will be snarly, you know, and you go through, like say wind dixie, and the waders are only snarly after the dolphins lose. Yeah. I think that was like an everyday occurrence. Well, more snarly. And you go through like a checkout canner, wind dixie, and the checkout girl, you know, will be just in a hospital. Yeah. Yeah. For 48 hours. We still haven't had a call for anybody from Piper High, 550 9490. You don't think we'll get one. Yeah, we'll get one. I think it's a good possible. It would be a good friendly caller. Will they be updated on Friendly Piper? We'll have to see. We're trying to mend our fences. We're trying to be real friendly with you. I'll under fair radio stations back on the air over there. KPX, KPX. I'm likely. Big 88. I'm likely. And if it is, we'll take care of it. Look at that. Another deadline there. Boy, these colors this morning. Great. You guys on a scale of zero minus infinity. You know what I'm saying? I mean, like you guys are pathetic this morning. There they go. Okay. Another offline. You mean they want to be beaten and whipped? You know what I'm saying? Oh, I know. They want to be flarsally. That's what this town is all about. 630 on Zeta 4, the Neil Rogers show. Oh, that was excellent. Boy, you can kind of promo for us anytime. Okay. Here we go. This is what they want. All our striker-likeers in the Zeta audience, here you go. The moment you've been waiting for. Okay. For us anybody who's been listening to the station must be in a little SNM anyway, right? Let's take our first call on the vocal line. They just call, but we're desperate. Hello. Good morning. This is Boca. Hey, Boca, how you be? Oh, I'd be good. How do you rotate? I'll stick to make a note. A comment here. I've seen that those were the dolphins. Those are guys just up like them. Yeah. Yeah. Everyone. Well, it's a new fetish now. There, but there's a whole bunch of guys dressing up like football players, you know? At the end of the kit, get in the way, though. Yeah. Oh, if I can make an unsmatched, I'll try to call for the lessons last week. But you may have mentioned about their runs and net notes. Yeah, very. That note says gets worse and they'll end up getting better. Yeah, they're doing like skin grafts. I think it's some radical register by Dorian Gray. I think Michael Jackson is involved in that somehow. Good day. Well, I'm trying to show with the button day. Okay. Have a wonderful day, sir. I'm trying to do. Okay. Because it could be the last one. 631 on Zeta 4. We don't want to create panic and chaos. Why didn't Captain Dave just close the door and lock us in? Huh? She tried to tell us something. I think maybe. Is this it? Well, we had a pretty good time here for six days. I agree. They said don't go by a house. Don't do anything rash. And I think they met what they said. Broward County, good morning. This is our paper called you watch. Hello. You? Hi. Morning. Yeah, you don't sound like you're from Piper. No, not from Piper. You sound like the Piper. Hi. Miami, hi. Yes. What? 1802? 61. Okay. Well, let's see. 61. It's not. It's playing like a dolphin. It's a matter of who's wearing the suit. Yeah. They're off to the sea. Talks with the dolphin. Yeah, that's true. They have no pass rush in. No secondary. So it's still a dolphin. You know, same thing. Absolutely the same thing. My wife Leroy is dying to hear for real. Your wife Leroy? Yes. Cibi. She'd be of the lighter shade. Her name be Leroy. Yeah. She'd be ill in today's series. How would you try to tell us? She'd be on it. Oh, great. In other words, you're, this is a request. Right? Is that all we're going to do on the show? Is have a request? We're going to have done requests? Why should this show be different than the previous one? Yeah, then the one on the AM. We're all the FM listeners are tuning madly to wins. You know, I mean, who the hell is that? Broadkitting, you know, the tea lady. Is that it, sir? Did you just, did you expire? Well, I have never heard a call just go so dead in all my life as you did. I know it's early in the morning. You can't keep up with this, right? No, go ahead. Okay, listen, have a great day. And we'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow will be Monday for you. Okay. Okay. That was good. That time I remembered Gloria. How you doing? Gloria? She, L.O.R.A. She came up to me in the Broward Mall yesterday in the patio. And she said, I made it to you. And I said, for what she said, you don't say good morning to me in the morning. And I said, look, they're like, who the hell are you? Huh? Vagoff lady, now she was nice, Gloria. And she wants the news. What's the news? We live on the red one area.
