Male because we do generate a lot of male and we put out a lot of male and Rick did as many many favors whatever I ask him he never said no to me Neil he always did it and he did it with a good attitude a smile on his face a great kid and he was tragically killed at an automobile accident last night and everyone here in the building is feeling a definite feeling of loss this morning and we certainly will miss him very much Rick Samson who sort of a did a lot of you know everything we needed whatever we needed he would do yeah yeah and as well as we sent along our sympathy to his family and do all of his friends and as you said we'll miss him around here we sure will anyway we got so many things to talk about and some of them are pretty depressing too including these morons with their pit bulls I know some other people have been talking about that and I've we've done a lot of shows on that in fact radio talk shows it on so many programs on pit bulls over the years it's become another one of those tried and true topics in the sad part of it is that they don't do anything about it that's the pathetic part and I was a Paul last night and CNN I know was on I'm sorry was on CBS on the channel for news at 11 o'clock and they showed the footage from the I guess it's K&XT in Los Angeles and with this crazy woman out there I mean you talk about a redneck she's the definitive pit bull owner this big road test pathetic woman and it wasn't bad enough that the first guy got mauled but then when the woman from animal control went out there they showed the footage they showed the tape and they showed the dog you know she was threatening her and while you better get out of here the dog's gonna get out again and sure enough she just opened the door far enough and the dog ran out of the tactus woman and ripped her hand up and and then this morning first thing I saw when I got off was the story in channel seven about the camera man's daughter who got mauled by the pit bull down here and you know I've said for a long time pit bulls and their owners ought to be destroyed you know that's basically the way I feel about it I mean there's a certain mentality there but I'll get into that you know we'll get into that a little bit later I was at lead story on four last night first story I think of mine I think it was and then the today show this morning with the Bryant Gumble whose voice reached new highs this morning at various times during the show they had a little segment about the FCC ruling which I thought I'd mention because some of you may have seen it and they had Diane calorie on again from the FCC but she is I hope they keep bringing her out everywhere because she's pathetic and they had a guy named Barry Lynn which is great I like people that have two first names and they had Barry Lynn from the ACU on of course they're challenging the FCC ruling on so-called in decent speech and again she gave absolutely all kinds of double talk and he really put her to shame even though the segment was very short and they showed a little bit of George Carlin and you know he made an answer out of her and the bottom line of the whole thing was that they still can't define what they're talking about she did all kinds of double talk about well you know you're carrying it too far and we're not suggesting that all sexual in you end door double on Tondra is actionable in fact most of what the Howard Stern stuff we heard was okay we just certain things but they won't tell us what the certain things were say so they want you to continue playing the guessing game which certain things were actionable they won't tell us and if you haven't sent in for so far by the way this Friday we're and I know originally I had said by the fourth of July we're gonna wrap this thing up and the you know March on Washington but that just wasn't giving us enough time and there's no sense in doing it you know too quickly or having any sense of urgency because obviously you know we've got a lot of time to carry this thing on and rather than just wrap it up now with about 30 or 40 thousand signatures and saying this is the best we can do work you know moving onward and upward and this Friday we're gonna have two pages two full pages the center full no pictures now but in fact we could add a picture of you that would have done a lot of attention or a picture with my name under it just of now I think the picture with your family is a lot of attention the picture the guy off the Zeta radio guide oh that would have a lot of attention for most radio broadcasts because you know most of them right they don't want to admit it but with my name under it or we could use the picture from the hairless morning from page two v in the local section Sean Paddock is in the pool at the Clevelander hotel on Miami Beach and if you're listening Sean we're gonna be giving the number shortly but anyway so you finally found something in the hairless you like yeah oh yeah well worth a quarter right spending quarter for that but anyway what was I talking about or the year this Friday and of course you folks in the general public out there you're not gonna be able to get it because unless you're a radio fanatic and subscribe to it which is unlikely groupie but our in our radio and records has really replaced billboard I mean only studs you old silly people read billboard magazine now and people who are you know looking for jobs and to come a washing didn't or Evansville Illinois little tiny markets read broadcasting all the good jobs are in our an hour which is why everybody in the business reads it and why they don't let us get it here in the building oh that's true are you never see a comment of this building do you not once it allows somebody will sneak it in a plain brown envelope not on this side of the building now but we never get to see it back here because they have all the good jobs in it but anyway we have the center full two full pages and they had his geared toward all radio broadcasters and you know basically the essence is what they have are you doing about this to fight censorship and defend free speech and if this doesn't do it nothing will in terms of really getting some national involvement on this getting everybody to write to their congressman well every radio session in the country will see the ad and by the way this is a piece of good news the senate avoided to show down with president Reagan today on and this is kind of a backhanded good news on his veto of the fairness doctrine bill that would have made it law democratic leader Robert bird faced with almost certain defeat first refused the republicans a set time for a vote on overwiting the veto then he had the bill routed to the senate commerce committee under the chairmanship of self-carellated democrat owners tolling and they approved emotion to send the disputed legislation to committee where they're going to you know keep it hanging until they think they have enough votes to pass it but it can hang there for an eternity so at least for the present time the fairness doctrine is still a provision of the SEC but it's not law as mandated by congress so for once Reagan did something right my accident you know if you're in there long enough I mean sooner or later you're going to do something right back there is getting to be a distinct similarity between Ronald Reagan and the presidency only every other Thursday for about five minutes and that's it that's the end of it so anyway that's what we're doing and if you haven't said your name and address to so far yet you know we have two things to point out number one what the hell are you waiting for and number two the address is so far p.o. box twenty two fourteen Miami three three oh five five what you've got to do is send us your name and address we supply the postage on the post cards and we've done everything except sign your name for you everything humanly and legally possible and all the cards are printed up already for you to send to your representatives and senators and you just have to sign them and drop them in the mail that's all very simple and they are paying attention because we're hearing from people they're good yeah letters getting letters back from Danny Fissile and I'm sure from some of the styles someone told me oh good excellent got a two page letter from the out of the aisle so the more the barrier and that's why you know we're going to get these cards to people in all fifty states to write to their congressman but the only way we can send you the cards is if you send us your name and address so far p.o. box twenty two fourteen Miami three three oh five five another said but not unexpected piece of news what it he pressing Wednesday yeah so are very sad piece of news but as I said not unexpected from a moronic redneck is that I hear through the grapevine that the Shirley Peters had a couple of guests on last night you know that station just has this real problem we've done a lot of shows here with the pre people with aids in fact I think we were the first ones but you know who cares we're not in in some kind of a contest to see who gets in a Guinness Book of Records and we don't do those shows for publicity we do them to try to educate the public and to make people a little more understanding and intelligent about this but the dubious news every time they do one of those shows there are people over there certain individuals three of them basically followed Thompson and now witchner who just have a nervous breakdown and they don't want to come in a studio and they're afraid they're going to be polluted they don't want to breathe the year and the Shirley had a couple of persons with aids on her show last night and witchner refused to come into the building and they had a call the Johnny Dolan of AM Don Webb in to do a witchner show because witchner refused how long can you go on being a stupid idiotic redneck jury that's the question yeah I mean it's pathetic it's embarrassing I mean there is absolutely no question that aids is not a disease that's an airborne virus it's not communicable by breathing the same air or talking into the same microphone or shaking somebody's hand which I'm sure he wouldn't you know it's just it's unbelievable to think that they have such neanderthals over there like Thompson and witchner who continues spreading all of his hate all of his hysteria and of course father just loves it because basically that's where he's coming from anyway is an extreme ugly right wing position that's what he's all about now think about a jury how do you catch aids yeah hasn't it been made very clear in the media while when your a singer is here you know don't don't expect him to learn something it is advanced state now it's true I mean the man is truly a monument to ignorance he butchers the language he is one of the most bigoted people I've ever known ever come in contact within my life and you know that gun of his is just and there's nothing else there really no you're laughing but I'm serious because I work with a guy for six years there's nothing else there if you take away that 357 magnum there's not even a human being there there's nothing behind it because that's his whole ego that's his whole macho thing is that gun and you know really I hope it never is to late to learn but I think in his case it may be but she just to continue displaying this this paranoia and this frightening ignorance said I don't think jury would have done what it takes to catch aids from an hate victim with these people I just don't believe it I'm not touching that like okay okay now let's do a break when we come back I think we got three breaks this hour boy this is getting really frightening now imagine what happened when we get to a 12-share oh boy we're in a lot of trouble ladies and gentlemen okay it's 1018 at WI and Z and I'm sorry that you know we sound a little bit down little model in here at the beginning of the show but we'll try to pick it up right try you'll start cackling in a little bit and the audience will start complaining yeah by the way speaking of cackling just before we take the break and I'm gonna get into this when we come back there's not a like to pick on other stations in the market you know that and but you know this morning I tuned in a certain station that you used to work at as matter in fact I don't want to mention which one it was and the not only can't you hear the host of the show who sounds like he's you know it's great that they gave me his own airstribe but are they going to give him a mic you know that would be nice you can't hear them the music is the right levels and the old the agony there is the right levels you can't hear the host I mean Greg we're all you know he's like he's like in another room somewhere like he's doing the show in Japan and they remind me lakes or something baby talk about the phony laughter I mean if anybody criticizes Glenn he'll I'm gonna stick up form today because I usually rip him and he deserves it but I'm gonna tell you anybody criticizes him for the contrived phony laughter that he's guilty of I mean shame on you that goes on and all these FM stations all the time that's all they do they sit I mean is it funny to say love 94 is you're you know doing the talk up to the record well at least he doesn't do the whole talk up like Ricky Tickey howmal but you know as you do in the talk up and you know you drop in love 94 and is that funny well I guess if you see the book okay 20 minutes after 10 at WI and Z will come right back 23 after 10 at WI and Z you're on just here till 2 and Stan Major will be along to do his thing what is his thing anyone yeah don't answer me okay anyway getting back to things I was listening to gloves 94 this morning and I don't like to pick on the other stations in town because most of them don't even deserve mention but they do they really do first of all talk about not knowing what the format is okay what is the format over there they put as that an old East station now I heard some day will be together by the supreme I guess Greg was dedicating that to Don Agony and they're all ready together again so I don't really need to play that or maybe he was dedicating it now let's see you never work with him did yes I did okay then it must have been for you yeah first time you were on a chicken right out Greg and say who you're dedicating it to for Tweety Bird you know just a little code there we know who it was I mean I spent the whole time I was listening there was in you window or in fact my name was mentioned within the first two minutes I tuned in the show yeah because they were doing who's the dumbest person in South Florida dumbest man dumbest man and some old fart evidently had called in and mentioned my name and I didn't hear that call but I heard a reference to it from a young lady who was taking issue with that and said that the caller was the dumbest man because I'm you know all this wonderful stuff and butel then said that he was an old and then we didn't hear the end of the word which I thought was very courageous I thought that was good I it you said they don't have a delay but it sounded I heard like what sounded like dumping three well dumping is not a good word um leaping yeah they believed it like three different times in the 15 20 minutes that I listen they must come into work this morning they don't have a delay well then what is that all about I mean if you're gonna say say the word don't pretend you're gonna say the word say it is not one of the seven dirt of earth I mean G if you can't call a guy at old fart Greg then what what kind of is your end of course it made no difference because nobody could hear many ways up my he's in another studio I'm serious couldn't you tell her are you deaf well that's I am deaf she I got this great stereo in my car that's you know my prize possession and I've got to turn to plenty loud the music is all right levels and everybody else and then all of a sudden I mean what is that all about what kind of a show is that and uh Neil this and Neil that and oh yeah we drive and howl and they all all the time and there's Madonna let's uh this we have did she ever we'd either to shave with today I mean come on guys let's cut it out will you please get your own material get your own body hair will you in fact I noticed you don't have to shave his facial hair off didn't they yeah what was that for was that for channel 10 probably I don't know did it a lot of the facial hair and he can't I didn't know what is that we have a racism reverse racism a channel 10 black people can have now hello and you know camera marshal if he had body hair over his whole head that would be good that would be excellent he is he is so bad you know not only does he look like he just came in with E.T. from another planet but he know he doesn't do sports he knows nothing about sports if you listen to the substance if you can watch it long enough to hear what he's saying he has no clue I mean he doesn't know a soccer from a curling you know he's in the twilight show how do we get to him it's a world of difference yeah yeah the world of difference waterdale can put a silly well see Dwight needs that mustache to look like a silly like the treasure cat in Alice and Wonderland he needs to look silly with a mustache whereas I guess but you know if he would still have the mustache on it would do I don't know what it means I guess white guys just can't have mustache is like Alan Mendelssohn now there's a guy who needs to be covered from head to toe with a big fur coat or something anything just get him off of there with those stupid props see now yesterday I mentioned all the people that I like on TV so today we're giving you cool time and we're a trash and a few of the ridiculous people on local TV great yeah terrific so you're I did like Mark Lugner a channel so oh god I wonder if he puts his hair in curlers you think so that's the only way any nobody has to hear that curly seriously he must put his hair in curlers at night all wouldn't that be great let's get him in here early in the morning and doing interview with Mark Lugner with his fur he's on well I bet he looks just like John Crawford in the morning but I bet he doesn't clean as well you know you're right he uses wire hangers yeah oh yeah come on Mark no more wire hangers we caught you yeah I've never seen a woman with hair that curly no well now that you mentioned it although he has a mustache which is good because it covers a big part of his face see now a lot of us we're in radio because we know in fact almost everybody you know in radio is ugly and there's a reason for we're not going to go on TV and assault the audience with our ugliness but some of these people just don't have enough good sense they won't keep their ugly push off the TV screen now speaking of that like Howard Stern for example Howard's funny on radio but if he really gets that show on TV it's gonna bomb because his nose I'm gonna tell you his bad as David Brenner's nose was Howard looks like David Brenner and Rick A's are put together put together he looks like rock sand you know Steve Martin that new movie with the Pinocchio nose that's Howard Howard wishes it would have grown someplace else but unfortunately nature doesn't work out that way in this week's TV works in mysterious ways you're looking this week's TV guys there's a full page ad for the new dating game and the other one tell show yeah by the way Alice was legitimately the interesting part of it is Alice is under a lot of pressure and a lot of attack from all sides not from us because we like what he's doing these days but that show yesterday on circumcision must have been really sensational huh I heard part of it where there's some cutting comments uh it must have been hot but anyway he was you know he was apocalyptic last week about Mike Thompson and Thompson's obnoxious fascistic you know let's uh tattoo everybody and you're just short of concentration camps you know that's where he's coming from now he's got witch ner who's doing his red neck I'm not gonna come in and breathe the ear thing you know how how must it feel to be over there in the midst of that malange of mong you know over there at W. snooze terrible unbelievable bunch of bigoted right wing a red neck fascist pigs and that's the best we can say about some of those people right yeah yeah back to look you know it's start cackling pretty soon I'm telling you I'm the I don't I don't know how we're gonna get this show I mean the whole depicting this morning is depressed which you can understand shell shot and um then of course all of this other stuff that I'm talking about here's not very uplifting the top of it all off and and the thing about the pit bulls and the stuff they're showing on the news is enough to make you're regurgitate and I know we're gonna get some of these people and if you call me today to tell me about what wonderful animals they are you see these animals were in bread long ago centuries ago okay and they were made to be mean and to fight to do this whole business and there's a genetic thing there now and you're not gonna eliminate it by patting them on heads say oh nice puppy nice puppy because when you least expected some of me even turn on the owners when they least expect you they don't discriminate and it's what no they're not discriminating and of course they're also don't give you any advanced warning it's when they all of a sudden you know have a bug in your ear or something then go they go nuts in a attack and they grab on and they won't let go and they just they're rip you to shreds now that's you know and I just to me seeing the pictures of that woman in California with her dog that was the same as witchener in his gun it's the same kind of redneck mentality I mean I can understand if people have a dog to protect them that's one thing but a dog that's like a killer beast you know that's to intimidate people that that's a different story sick scary pathetic subhuman and always get these calls every time you do a show on this and there these people oh yes my wonderful pet the powwow he's just never never stole a freight train and you know in fact I wouldn't put it past the pit bull you know to you can just see now locking onto the end of a freight train and dragging it down the tracks about 80 miles an hour I could see it look at all the fuel we could say right the y'all he's get this calls we'd never had a problem oh yeah always get as I said before pit bulls and their owners ought to be you know put away ought to go to doggie heaven or hell or whatever it is I'm serious because it's a sickness there are all these you can go down to the animal shelter to the pound and you'll find thousands of dogs and for those of you who have a weakness for cats which I don't want to get into you find loads of animals beautiful little animals that need a home that are already potty train they're like they're ready to go you know what I'm saying all you got to do is give them a couple of bucks whatever it is and take it home and you're all set you got a nice pet all kinds of breeds mongrules i recedders german shepherds you name it we don't need pit bulls right i mean how many breeds of dogs do we need before we satisfy so I think the solution is to have all the pit bulls that turn on their owners and then we'll shoot the pit bull when they finish the job and I'm hey bingo it's all over with right we got the problem solved both ways I have no idea what that has to do with gloves ninety four no not we're not gonna mention what's his name anymore because he's getting too excited about although he he he he he ask you to continue to be a love's it he was tinkling this morning was he really so the upset him we were about time I heard he hasn't tinkled in months yeah we won't mention his name just upset him it gloves ninety four so but I do have one thing to tell you speaking of looks just to finish that thought we don't finish it expand on it well as we may talk for four hours today yeah we might need these pain in the ass callers if you'll look and tell you please play this and you please but get lost with that stuff I will play it when we're ready to play it not request you may say hello could you please say goodbye oh here comes our first message oh we've been waiting for this they never say please yeah never no they demand is a matter of fact we want to hear it right now are we're gonna write to the FCC and the management well you can't write to management here because they're out to lunch I don't mean just like now it's just kind of like a long lunch you know it starts in January it ends around New Year's Eve that's already a management that's such it although it's a matter of degree I mean it could be worse we could be an IOD oh did you ever get to find out what Bill McQuig wanted yesterday called him back he wasn't there whether something going on over there that we haven't found out about but I left the message oh boy never got back to you no maybe he's back in Texas and you told him what could you want to say to me if you want to yeah it's amazing the calls

look at the break this is good oh yeah remember the day we did that almost three hours now when we got to it it was worthless that was the incredible part of the same song really big thing going on and we took like three hours to get to it and by the time I'm gonna leap it up blurred it out you're gonna it was going to do the same thing to this well I know I think this could be really big good it's not gonna be as good as this picture and here it is fine again it's just a picture okay it's just some young guy floating in the Cleveland or hotel pool in Miami Beach probably is name is on Sean Pad you can probably just it's a tourist and I turn the picture upside down I took a look and I said well hey the Harold can't be all bad he's finally given in a little bit of course just above it on the top part of the page look at there's Joe Robby now this isn't that a guy you'd like to be from a look at a look on his face oh what a hangout oh boy kind of guy you want to go to date out of put him on the defensive line man he'd scare everybody away they'd be running back to their old they're on goal line if they saw Joe look at that picture oh I think that must have been when he was sitting near Rick weaver when he had that expression face I mean talk about a sour look oh boy okay well frankly one nostril or two Joe well I don't blame you from what I heard 25 before 11 at WI and Z on a

Tuesday well I tell you he's doing great they got great numbers they're untalked and they're I tell you is that is that a tribute to how desperate the talk audiences in his town they're desperate they really are oh that's right I heard as matter fact I heard that at the 815 I heard pattern change I wasn't not see I must confess I was listening to Bruce Williams and I heard us you know I heard a little crackle at you here when we changed pattern and then the crackle kept going on and it was kind of interesting and I realized that we were off the air how long were we off the air or I'm too hour yeah I heard it all of that must have been a pubic service huh oh well with the f well I'm listening to people listen to talk net they wouldn't know the difference but the fm was off too you know oh no yeah so what's the difference you said it he said we don't want to start up with them again they're not because we understand through the grapevine okay we understand through the grapevine that Peter Bulger called in one of our a m people oh fm was only off for an hour but that's okay we can give him the extra hour handy cap you know in fact if we were doing six for longs we could start at the seven for a long marker and we could let them start at the top of the stretch and we'd still beat him you know no problem even if we were carrying 140 pounds and they had like um Diane Wodstas or whoever she is but anyway um I don't want to mention Ron's name on the air because he got himself in a lot of trouble yesterday with that excellent call by the way that was right on target when he called in here and he is going to be filling in what the first day of my vacation Ron here is so yeah oh that's going to be good because Ron's going to be by Monday he ought to be really ready for that he's going to just tear ass in here on Monday isn't he's ready now yeah he is he in fact G I really missed the mark didn't I if I would have put him on today I could have gone to call today because he was ready this morning man he is ready to kill told me back foaming it he's like a pit bull in heat there is better and I don't blame him and he was called in the program director's office in the fm you know Peter who used to be our friend up until a quarter to ten quarter to eleven yesterday when you guys talking about you talking about me how well what do you talk about what are you saying very sensitive all the good real nervous well they saw that those numbers you know and I was told yesterday that I'm over reacting because it's going to take at least a year for that format to get off the ground and of course isn't that what they said to the people who preceded the right brothers uh and what happened with them you know until the right brothers came along none of that other stuff ever got off well maybe a couple inches off the ground that at all collapsed in smash juicy those films haven't you sure those first attempts to fly sure well they all thought it was going to take about three minutes to get off the ground surprise surprise but we're not going to rag him because they're doing their best that weren't that's the part that's frightening oh they're doing their best my story do their duty well wait a minute don't interrupt the of your story yet it's in with you if it does it really yeah well we get around to it'll be right together with what we're talking about yeah see this is one of those days where we need to do one of these convoluted uh as Bob Lashitor would say monologue is that what this is a monologue yeah a four hour monologue and then of course there's no time left to take call Kyle likes that look at him he is foaming at them out he's so enthused we might not take any calls today come on should we give it a shot look at that there's one vote yes I vote yes come on let's make it unanimous let's see come on there's three hands and there are only two of us get four hands there's only three of us well and you haven't even raised the hand yet mr. coward spelt courage especially anyways I started to say before before I was so rudely interrupted see now that I said no calls look at that look at that flash of bunch of mung brains practically frantic flash again we need to rest from them once in a while I mean who wants to hear these people well I'm going to listen to you for one more week I know I can only handle another week and then he calls back that's the incredible part well I guess he figured if he was going to be calling us he better get it out of the way before he stopped listening that guy I thought about him yesterday man that was incredible wouldn't be something if he choked out to be the guy in the pool no no I don't think so no this kid's got a lot more of smarts than that huh yeah by the way if Sean what's his name here yes he'd have a good if he calls in we'll take his call so you're going to have to at least screen the call now he'll know okay you'll know by the flash on the phone believe me when the light lights up haha in technicaler then he'll know like unreliable children the soft Florida colors love to pester us all that's true it's like little kid I've always said that you know like little kids who taunt you and they just pester and pester than they run away because they know they're going to get beaten then when you're least expecting it they start sneaking up and they start pestering again then they run away and it never stops it never stops agreeing the doorbell and running away okay now let's see from everybody in the audience who'd like us just to dump the calls today and do four hours and just you know play it by ear let's see it on the phone how about you there are a lot of people who'd like to see us just skip all the calls today and just see it here and have a good time and smooth a little bit look at that course for more ringing already but that's okay hey listen timing is everything in life all seven of Marlet I think you're serious about not taking calls serious as a door knob okay well I have never been more serious in my life you're really thinking about it wait a minute there were a lot of positive calls about the phone out oh yeah that's right that was last April that's true in fact when we had our guests in here we just talked for four hours we took no calls and they were some of the best shows we ever had with those guests let's see who can we go out in the building and drag in here talk I don't think today is the day to go out and go out and go all the days leave it to you to come up with an idea like that oh boy mister tact you know everybody is weeping and you know and it's a really depressing place today and if you missed the beginning of the show one of our staff members died in a tragic automobile accident last night for it what was it in the early 20s I would think yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah very nice kid and everybody's upset and broken up here and you know to try to develop some kind you know for me to come on a year playing some kind of wild rockist thing this morning would have been inappropriate because I just don't feel that way sure would have yeah there were trouble what does that mean in other words you would have jumped all over me if I would have done that you'd have come in here and say tacky yeah that's what he would have done in other words if I would have tried to lighten things up a little bit and get people laughing you to come in here so there's no way to win say oh we've talked about now you're saying well you know he's really being depressing getting your audience into a model and you said that doing the break now we chuckle a few times here no I didn't chuckle at all you cackled a couple of mini cackles which is the best we've gotten out of and so far today which brings me back isn't it amazing I've always said that you know what goes around comes around or something like that and that these things piece together and we went through that whole convoluted thing to bring me back to what I was going to talk about in terms of that station that I listened to this morning for half hour coming to work and they were cackling it stuff that wasn't even I mean the call letters are not funny okay if they would have said gloves 94 and cackled that would have been funny maybe they'll do that tomorrow yeah come on Greg why don't you say gloves 94 tomorrow that'd be funny that would be a fact I think it'd be hysterical if they could I know those jingles that got cost a lot of money but I think it would be funny if they invested a few bucks and got one that said gloves 94 and that would be that'd be hysterical look at all the attention we'd promote it yeah sure and then Peter would come in here and we'd have another closed door meeting and we don't want any friction between the two stations we all want to get along and the people are not in a good mood up there they're a little sensitive they saw the numbers a little sensitive well they're super sensitive yeah they're foaming at them out they're looking at R and R they're checking the job listings no listen takes a long I was told yesterday takes a long time a long time for that format to get off the ground's gonna take them a good year at least I'm telling you verbatim that's what I was told yesterday all right I was not told to stop raggingy fn that's one thing I'll say because they know if they say that to me that I'll only do it that much more say they finally have learned to understand me here a little bit that is that they have to use reverse psychology in fact if they encourage me to come on year and rip rfn then they know I'll probably cut down a little bit yeah they did not however encourage me so I'm not cutting down they do know that about you by the way and whatever they tell you I do the opposite and look how it's working man it's like a shark look at the ratings do we have to talk about how and that can we what do we have to mention how and they'll know you know and boy as soon as I heard that I knew I was on a right track man I just attacked it full force and look what we did we're like a 99 share with with the stars and the sunny rose and burglars mousosa we got it all in February maybe sunny call us today now we wouldn't talk to that do you know I got a bet get rid of him whatever happened to sunny that's what I mean now that he's the mayor I guess he doesn't have time for us right it's probably blasting out of his office he's too he's too busy doing impotent things he leaven before and he's one of the most impotent officials in all of South Florida I'll guarantee that you leaven before eleven at w i n z and we'll come back after this okay we have a new bumper sticker for owners of pit bulls to display on your automobile bite the hand that feeds you and hopefully your pet will read it now mall the hand that feeds you with that would be disgusting although it sounds pretty good to me in the sun sentinel my favorite newspaper that comes at the sixth thirty in the morning with the yellow wrapper on it um you notice I qualified that because it's not really a good paper but it's sure better than buying that herald although if they're all keeps printing like this now you know the more I look at that that could be a very young man in that picture they really can't tell they've touched the herb with you today well I won't see which one no he's not that young he's about to he's of legal age so I can't get my story out before you talk about this in the prison panel declares hungry dead is this incredible boy what a surprise by Scott A's a most and this is the most disgusting story really this is amazing this is so typical this is like saying you know Hitler is dead now in fact I take that back and there's still those who don't believe that who can we uh who can we use this like saying A Blinken is dead okay is that the controversial is there any debate about that I don't think so it's like saying that the Nero is dead Julius Caesar Abraham unless of course it's Abraham Solomon he's dead too you know he was my grandfather may he rest of the show them as they say in a certain parts of the beach Tours see you don't understand any of that that's good we need a good goeisha couple I came in here because he doesn't understand any of those expressions I know I'm a goe boy as opposed to what what's in your calls Jewish people jubois yeah I'll never forget the time he said on the air to a caller who is referring to me so he's a good jubois jubois I mean this man has his prejudicial tendencies that haven't even been discovered in the human race yet am I right yeah but I said in the human race which it was qualifies it as far as he's concerned but that's like that's an accurate statement about me are I a goe boy that's a disgusting and maybe the boy George I think would be more accurate is it really disgusting no I mean you stick to call me that oh don't tell me she's Jewish yeah oh no ladies and gentlemen all of my Jewish friends on this day monestana hallila haza that we all want to reconsider I mean she's enough to make you want to give it up you told that to Sammy Davis man think oh tell Richard Taylor he'll take that mrs off in no time the rostid you oh boy he'll be rostigoy and he'll be back to eating those grits or whatever it is tourism panel declares spring break dead say goodbye to where the boys are says Scott's a most in the most ridiculous article that's the opinion of Broward County tourism officials who decided on Tuesday and listen to this it took a morning one year to kill something that's been going on for 30 years right in one year they killed it and they told it has it now and as I predicted as I predicted on this show they're going to be ringing their hands saying oh what are we going to do now that's what always goes on in this town like with casino gambling the herald scared the pants off of everybody we don't need it it's horrible the mob okay everybody voted against it now what do we do well don't ask us we don't know you know that's the response same in for Laudadale all those fascist right wing hateful nasty redneck type people who don't like kids who don't want fun who you know who want it to be another geriatric paradise they chase the way all the kid of course we include in that group of fascists the police up there in Broward the sheriff and the for Laudadale police who are probably among the worst in the country in law enforcement the most right wing militant fascistic bootstumping goose stepping other than that they're not bad well listen Broward County tourism officials decided on Tuesday not to advertise spring break after concluding they definitely want the Fort Laudadale institution to end we've lost spring breaks at James Paint and a member of tourist development council's marketing advertising committee if we try to advertise it we are committing suicide there is too much of a negative image in the college community for spring break to to come back Nikki Grossman said oh yeah she's a genius so to simply market spring break on college campuses again would be a waste of money Bob Mottwani owner of the Merrimack Beach resort hotel warned that many small businesses cannot survive without the collegiate business now here comes the book good part when general motors are forward half the discontinue or particular model they spend years to come out with a substituted set here they have no plans to generate any kind of business to replace what we've lost very well said that's right same thing that i said months ago fact i said it last year when they were the process of arresting everybody in chasing the kids away now we don't want them here because they got too much money to spend in their too young if they were old and they only wanted the early bird dinner and they were nasty and miserable and drove ten miles an hour then we'd like them welcome them with open arms yeah exactly with open packages of sweet and low we'd welcome what a disgusting you know this area such a contradiction man you walk out and even in the middle of the summer the sun is shining at 7580 degrees the climate is beautiful the natural beauty the sand and the ocean that everything it's just phenomenal the people that run this state man are maniacs from this governor this fascist governor we've got up there this lying big of a governor all the way down the line i mean what's the hope it's like they've taken paradise and turned it into hell which is why we call Florida of course a tropical depression oh it's really it's frustrating i guess if you can be oblivious and just go ahead and fake your way through life and none of these things are important to you then you can survive but if you're one of these businessmen and you have to come on making you're living from living and breathing people coming and spending their money you're screwed you're screwed and of course our good governor look at all the business we're losing in this state now and we don't want to leave him alone because the democratic leadership and the legislature went right along and oh yeah they were right there good old runs silver and all those great Americans all those douchebags and didn't the jack ordinance hit right on this show with time at first and didn't they say oh don't worry there's no support for this don't worry about it don't make a big deal about it they say right on this show so we just forgot about it and now we're all screwed except for Mike Wolff who's in the other room looking at pictures of me

bigotry is legendary it's unbelievable how in fact when you look up redneck in the dictionary you'll see jayers picture that's it's like desert roo i mean a man is it's incredible uh does he still always saw the new numbers for me by the way uh if uh Craig is listening we don't knock anybody on the air but the don't tell us people on the audience we're making the numbers up because we give all accurately we don't knock uh Craig told some lady on the air at three thirty in the morning we had a report from one of our spies right that uh oh don't pay any attention to those numbers they're just spreading rumors those are only trends and they don't mean anything in the book won't be on for another month trends well you know it's it's two thirds of the book that's right there numbers we didn't just make them up there it's a research drawing indicate and boy i'm telling you those nighttime numbers talking at be cherry by four to one almost you know miniscule jare uh see the problem with

end of his rope with the major through and i don't blame him i mean stand you know it's just right on a log here you know what the spot are you can tell how many breaks you i mean is it complicated of course not care fuck oh i made it in broadcasting look at that look at that here's a big article about uh in lesons say radio sound and fcc's fury and this week's broadcasting you and Gary Gary Lawrence Gary Lawrence oh we both made this yeah well other morning people may not offer quite the same degree of shock but there are those who seek and profit from controversy James Moby Karny on k e glfm fort worth has been quoted as saying i pick on ladies i pick on gays i pick my nose i pick on fad white guys red nexon foreigners well that's on like stand major listeners in the Miami area have complained to the commission that w i n z fm's neorodges and you like that why are they ahead of their time a lot all right let's hear it for broad guys they magazine w i n z o with theater boulders in the building it's gonna be coronary time that's a fm you've got to withers in the Miami area complaint of the commission that w i n z fm's neorodges the grades women malines the pope is racist and anti-semitic one writer who said rodges called one woman in old fart uh only one yeah we called a lot of people old fart you know what every one of them we call that it was exactly that love or meant too now where's about Gary Lawrence is that in here later on who's pictures and yeah okay Gary Lawrence general manager of w i n z fm said rodges style is far removed from a sterns but not so far removed that he cannot be in Lawrence's words insulting in controversial he also noted that rodges is the number one talk show in south florida mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm mm and the rest goes on about uh that simple enough that the Carolyn Fox and Providence all that's who she is a potty mouth idiot house or in clothes yeah exactly she went to the class to copy Howard Stern study this tape yeah brilliant really good kwello lays it out front of broadcast station manager in current FCC commissioner James Kwello he's the one that put all that dead error on w j r years ago touch briefly on the FCC's in decency policy during a speech to the broadcast promotion marketing executives honors lunch in June 13th in Atlanta the commission is caught in a crossfire he said between first amendment and a growing public public outcry for action against indecency on the air the FCC asserted is not an a kind of a Salem witch hunt to exercise evil disjockeys or ludes students and we're not creating a new law we're trying to enforce an established law he said a law made difficult to enforce because of narrow interpretations of past FCC's we are he said just reinterpreting the commission's legal precedent in a broader more practical way personally he said is a strong first amendment man this gives me some problems but he said that the FCC's action was a response to a growing outcry citing 20,000 complaints and not three or four now you see that's a lie okay they had 20,000 complaints that are letters last year but the overwhelming majority of those had nothing to do with indecency speech those were letters from listeners who were complaining about signals being interfering or whatever it might have been I mean there are dozens of different subjects and only a small minority of those had anything to do with indecency speech at the start of that article as a matter of fact there's a breakdown on the actual numbers out of that 20,000 most of them were television yeah complaints about and we're running a lot of interest they did that segment on the today show they had Diane Coloria again in the guy from the ACLU and Maria Schreiber was doing the interview with her something wrong with her job on man she just I'm telling you it's not all there part of it's missing I think Arnold or Mary I think that's how he's married off mr. Mussel can you imagine laying underneath Arnold it's interesting they kept talking about us that radio I'm sorry they kept talking about radio as the never at any time indicated the FCC ruling is anything to do with television which of course it does allegedly but it's obviously it's going to look the other way and isn't this interesting in May after the interest of the public had been stimulated by the publicity given the commissions crackdown the commission received 272 letters regarding obscenity indecency and profanity involving a m and f m stations and a category headed a s all services including television and cable the total was 357 yeah after they stirred everybody up that's what they did they in a while if after they stirred everybody up and and got public response you can imagine what it was like six months before that hello hi yeah welcome to talk to us off the air Winesies vivid service this guy wants to know if you know what W i o d really stands for tell us sir we insist on douchebags that's pretty good another bad call was it Mike Miller yeah okay hello thanks a lot Mike hi hello nobody there it was my can't funny I bet yeah hello oh it's fruke ke ke ke and him off there when you give it a rest already go call running that he needs the call and you're not supposed to talk to me there by the way I thought my fault all right if Mark I did you know everything by the way that's twice already I didn't speak to him either time yeah that's the famous excuse what are you pointing at you're looking for somebody to blame I'm not going to be with this go hello hi it's been I'd love to you yeah you lost my good friend I'm rolling yeah he's doing something I've seen with a hero I can tell oh these call hello credible sir is the Indian pompano mr. ke ke and him off of there and don't dig the fun by using that name hello fruit would be much better I'm going to have to take a break in him yes it is true he's want true I Neil did make a movie Neil does howl and Dale yeah right get hello yes Neil does Vegas this is Glenn two things number one yeah oh how we almost forgot about her in the midst of all these going zone here today yeah and this guy sitting over here always pushing the numbers need those calls we don't need any calls on this show we don't care if anybody calls look at that they're all calling that we don't care this week until you break new ground you don't call it when I come back from vacation I'm going away again and take the call all the time no others talk so that here it is here's the every Wednesday we wait recklessly those of us in the business we wait with baited breath for the Wednesday Linda Thornton radio column in the Miami hero don't wait true now isn't it interesting was it two days ago that we got to it was Monday two days ago and my memory is correct that the arbitrends came out correct and of course nobody anywhere in the country pays any attention to birch because Tom birch of course some of some of the people feel pulled the numbers out of a hat and the birch survey is still questionable at best because all those little prepubes and kids answer the phone at night and we're listening to what power ninety six and we're making scratching sounds on the phone and on each other yeah he rolls the dice and comes up with a numbers and the so far you know he's rolling your snake eyes anyway there's nothing in Linda's column about the arbitrend right but it came out Monday but there is another one of these listings the birch top 10 now she were listing birch beer top 10 that would be more exciting like they're taking shake of course we know that steak and shake is going out of business because my murder told me that it must be true the steak and shake are no fools they're not going to come to this market even crystal won't come to this market you notice that can you blame what is nothing like going to Tampa and going through crystal and just opening the trunk and say fill her up you know I know I agree to you little burgers that's great when you're depressed like if you have a bad show like after Ricky taking leaves wax your everything he should have a chance to drive right through crystal every day he's probably got to go through food Rutgers up there it's right near their studios it waxed he up there where the turn is on sunrise guy am I right yeah federal highway absolutely and one thing about food Rutgers now there's one in my neighborhood I finally did get to go there well first of all I mean talk about standing online for an hour and a half to get a hamburger how good can a hamburger be you know what I'm saying I mean it can be sensational but to wait for an hour and a half I can't believe you had to wait oh you wait for a lifetime and you want to money when you get it it tastes good but about three hours later your stomach is doing the Mexican hat thing oh talk about making a mad dash really after you eat there you want to stay very close to home for a few hours trust me in autumn sand or to a place where they have a very readily available facility in fact for a lot of you people over there a lot of the prunes any audience who haven't had a good movement a long time head for that place because there were a couple of hours it'll be an explosion it'll be like an earthquake but anyway here's Linda with a top 10 Miami for Lutterdale stations in Birch and a give you an idea of who answers the phone okay what do you think's number one it's always a ratchee scratchy wpw power powerless ninety second ten point four share they got a ten point four share like I've got an 87.3 right in fact I may be closer to an 80 say you know what I'm saying 10 point four then life with a 6.1 and it's always there is not one a m station and a list never not one there never is because all these little kids answer the phone here's hot 105 and we know that nobody listens to them anymore time and joyless one oh seven and the ed r and g to r and the waxy and magic one oh 2.758 and that's it from a 10 to 4 down to a 360 in other words what Linda is trying to say is that a m radio is dead of course we know that Linda's listening here right now this is what and at the bottom of the column it says Linda our thorton will be a guest host on your Roger show from 10 into 2 p.m. Tuesday on w i n z 790 a m now they know where we are it's is nine for all right this is not the right nine forty a m her guest from 10 into noon will be radio program and operations directors Peter Bulger of z a 94.9 f m bill tenor of power 96 w p o w f m
