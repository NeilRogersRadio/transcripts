Oh, he didn't. Just door three kaboos. Ha ha ha. Listen to this. I remember you were ready to take the BT. Very vaguely, yeah. Well, if you have, I... Like the audience, very vaguely. They're going to, where it has its side selling time. Oh, no. What do you mean by that broke ring time? No, like airtime. Oh, there was oozy. That was, I was in at the downtown. Ha ha ha. What are you talking about? They're going to start selling airtime. I don't know. They're going to sell time like WVCG. In other words, broke or time was what I said, and you just kind of like ignored me. In other words, you can buy a half-hour. Exactly. In other words, you can buy an hour, couple of hours. Maybe I'll buy some time on air. Yeah. No, I want to be on a station that somebody can hear. I also, that means they're getting rid of King. King. Not the dog, the show. Well, same difference. The show is a dog. OK, I wanted to tell you what's happening at IO-dong. Yeah. I'll see you, could anymore. OK. Jim Frank, the new tanker in the morning. Yeah. Leaving for Chicago. Well, that's where he came from. Well, but I'll throw you going back to work. I'd like to Jim. They really screwed him over good over there, too. Do you? Do you? Yeah. OK. Bill McLeake is going to do after noon news. So somebody's going to be doing in the two. Couldn't be somebody we know who's out of a job, put it. Wait a minute. Go ahead. We're waiting. What's your name? No, not Sam Adrian, not Conan. No, not, not the, well, I know that they wouldn't have offered him anything. That way, let me tell you, my kids and idiot, if I ever knew an idiot. Gee, did you just discover that? Did you just finally discover that? I called them up yesterday. I don't want to speak to him. I like that he knows I'm being fired. Hmm. Oh, I can't wait for that day. Well, hopefully, that hopefully, Gary will get some sense. I want to hear that call personally, yeah. And the last thing is with the, thank God. Who's what? What about Stan? He's going. Is he going to keep that wind? I'll let you know tomorrow. OK. I want to say you were talking about. How long can this call go on with such turnmark, TDman, all this dead air and it's long pause. Which understand this is a major market moring show. OK, there he goes. 23-7 on Zeta 4. We've apologized for that last call from our somewhat zanked-out Kendall Correspondent. Next time we know we'll redeem himself and do a much better job. Somebody told me that somebody was buying K-8. Did you hear that? Mm-hmm. That, uh, a computer. The company, what do you even do? Take a jury, which new lessons are something? The company, Sam, you're in a coma. The company that happens, love, and I'm thinking of buying it. You know, if you look at their numbers by the way, I hate to do that because I sound like somebody called in the early part of the show. Yeah. Well, they've got like all teeny buffers, man. That's it. All those kids that are hooked on that scratch crap. It's always been that way over there. And powerless, 90's. If you took away their teenagers, they'd be off the air. Oh, that's true. That's very true. They do phenomenal in teens. But that's it. That's why I heard that Tanner does phenomenal in teens. Okay, um, we're gonna go to sunrise. Hello sunrise. Hey, good morning. How are you doing here? Hello sunrise. How's my- I made this funeral. I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind. I'm blind. I hear new Roger's from home. Ha ha ha. I'm not nice to be. They there, they're just me. Ha ha. There's just one problem. They don't fall or else to be. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Living in this country. And before these wars of the year, I'm just home. Ha ha ha ha. You're just home. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. You're just home. I think somebody found a hold of figure over there for just a second. Yeah. Nice note. You hit there. I think you had another moving experience by the Fending Machine. Okay, figure out certainly a pleasure to hear from you. That was tight. What's up at me? Sure. Good job this. You must have been gone soon. I want a grab level. I want to help the countries in the war against the Sandin East Hills. Because I don't want the Kummy shit or back to us. You're just by best countries. We're just here some missiles to Iran. We'll say it's all point-dix to his plans. All he knew was a hero. He's like you as he rolled it. But he was told with those weapons he saw for a rainy and gold. Everybody. Ha ha ha. On me, could work well. And on the iron, you're too loud. Let's reflect those tankers. You're coming in a cancels or on his lip or you know that is painful. But you know he deserves it. That towel isn't free because of girlfriends and steaks. We're going to be there. We're going to be there. We're going to be there. We're going to be there. Okay. There goes from the Martin Bormon School of Personality Semitar and on Zeta 4. And I'm not going to get into a big thing about Reagan and about you know these people this morning. Bye-bye. She was nice. She was very nice. A silly child. Did he play Alice Bluegown? I think so. No that was the previous week when he was doing his famous cross dressing. Oh boy that was a show. Yeah. In fact he was running around remember in class where Roblo was dressed up like Jesus and he was carrying that big class. Yeah. And that's exactly what Alice did. And the glass slippers and a big cross and that was it. And it was disgusting. Okay. 26 before 8 on Zeta 4 and I'm going to be so delighted when we get that exercise in whatever you call it. What do you want to call it? Exercise in ratings building over there. Because the people who are listening they couldn't give a damn less about who wins the tickets or about Bottle who's saying or whatever. And you know that's see the problem is that people cater to a small group of selfish phone callers. Do you want to say I've never done that? No. And it's not necessary. No. I'm more interested in the masses out there. So why are you giving this away just to be a good guy? You think we ought to change our mind? Well that would be some people up so. You just try to be a good guy. We're going to get them foaming at the mouth. You know that people would love to have these tickets. Okay. Now ordinarily at this hour ladies gentlemen used to be Mr. Sports. We do the sports and then they took him to Cleveland. They started doing IDs. And then I started doing the sports and I got tired of it. I got sick of it. And I said nobody cares about these stupid scores. And so that's it. If you want this sports call it.
