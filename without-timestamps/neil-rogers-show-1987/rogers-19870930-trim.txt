corns you're from Chicago well you know what an acorn is right well like a chestnut yeah that's all so don't get nervous believe a raisin god is not an equal opportunity a dispenser okay yeah raisin I have a great line about I'm not going to click you with it because you know you're already sensitive today and I'll save it for tomorrow by the way I wonder if this is still there yeah it's still there it's good it's a rowered hello yeah wait a minute wait a minute mine who owns body wrap is on this line sorry pal but the one who runs like you hello how you doing hi is this is this Mr. body wrap this is Neil how you doing pretty good okay so what I just heard you talking about the body rappers someone mentioned it to me and I own the ultra u body slot in Southane I just uh that's one we're talking about oh I just what maybe I could just a mince letter information does kind of a new situation there's a lot of skepticism along with uh 96% right now efficiency factors far as the please in our customers all right now what can you do uh with a big fat slab like me that's the question here for one thing we've learned Neil and that's we the person asked to decide exactly what they want to do I mean are you for me to with body by solar flex no sir I am now you know you don't know that solar flex exercise equipment that they sell oh the exercise equipment okay no and you've probably seen the ad that they do for that with Scott Mads and with a kid with a wonderful body when I get through with your body wrap I want to look just like that no what we basically do is we work on the cellulate which is not even a medically accepted term but it's the fatty talking the positive in your body and we even take place solution and you are rapidly with our secret solutions from your neck down here toes will your secret solution right it's a secret solution and then we have something in it which is rather expensive and totally organic and drug and chemical free and we guarantee that people they must lose a few six inches on their body measurements in one visit or they don't pay a penny and we guarantee in writing that it'll stay up for at least 30 days and it's not a water loss program or a cellulate wrap we even encourage them to drink our crystal springs water and we've been pretty full we haven't we've been full every day we've been open really yes sir I'm full right now as a matter of time that's as we need I'd like to get you and Glenn I listen to you show everything now I'm wrapped up there at 16 hours a day I'll speak to gentlemen down for a complimentary wrap and you can give your unbiased view but now let let me just ask you a couple of questions okay because I'm really excited about this but you know we're skeptical to say the least because most of the stuff is garbage now you know that there've been a lot of comments and a lot of stuff that's been on the price of call you this morning because again your listeners are going to interpret it based on whatever our comments are and I'm again I'm I'm taking you can to be complete the devil's advocate and I'll try to work with you okay now I will come down and do it because I'm excited about it I'm here you said they're guaranteed to land to least 30 days now what happens because we did the first woman we had call said that the stuff works or at least she didn't know specifically which woman we're talking about and she says what happens then is after you start drinking water is that it all comes back it's guaranteed to stay up for at least 30 days and we encourage them which I don't even mention some people are there we encourage you to drink six to eight glasses of water per day after the wrap and if any part of that inch comes back within 30 days if you let us measure you we will wrap you again at no charge and if it doesn't come off then we'll write you a check on the spot for the introductory wrap which is $19.50 if you go to Tahoe or California they're 85 to about 125 and a lot of them are using a different type of solution which is an herbal which does which is about 25 percent less taken off the individual. All right now what how many sessions do you have to go through on this thing? We have people that take anywhere from five wraps up to a year that depends on what we ask you what you want to lose and we base it on losing one pound a week without diet. All right now wait me when you say how much you want to lose how do you lose weight by this thing you're not sweating it off? No you don't it's what you're doing is you're losing the toxins and we're telling you what kind of food to eat without dieting in conjunction we are not we are basically an adjunct we are not a panacea for for diet or exercise and by the way if you exercise every day you're not going to lose any weight most people do not know that and they think they do and they don't they work on we work on the out of post tissue which is above the muscle below the skin and that's filled with the basic fatty talk that the pod is the kidneys cannot excrete and this is just medically accepted information Okay now let's see where is this located this is in the public.

But anyway, the guy who came by who is pushing that Sadie's buffet. Oh yeah. What is his story anyway? I mean, that's a guy whose friends with Chris, over little Chris that was on a show. Well, who's 12 now he had a birthday so he's getting more legal every moment. That's right. But still little child he's 12 year old boy obsessed. And we can talk about him because that's why he was here because David's legal. See, he's in Sadie's buffet now. He's a week and talk about him. He won't hear. Okay, well, let's take the break first and when we come back we'll try to figure out what that's all about, okay? Because he's like, try is right. Yeah, we're going to try to figure out. Hey, he's obsessed with that whole thing. Oh, and it's all he's talking about. There's nothing worse than when somebody becomes obsessed. Listen, we all have our thing. You got your thing. You always got his thing. What a show. What a show. You can say that again. How did I say the WINZ 94.0 on your AM dial? 22 past noon at the home of hysteria. WINZ. Okay, let's should we take some more calls here because they seem to be flashing rather frantically here. Must have a lot of rappers out there. Hopefully you don't want to discuss Sadie's buffet. We can move on. Oh, I forgot about that. Well, you know, there's been a lot of distraction in here in the last two after three minutes. Yeah. The WINZ and the cafeteria San Paya in Hilea. So we were talking about Sadie's buffet. Yeah. It is all the man talks about. I don't know his name. What is his story? He was there and he just goes on and on and on about your coupons. He gives me these coupons and I'm sure it's a very nice place, but I mean, he just, he's got stock in the place or what? I think stuff on Morrison's own that place. If they do, don't think. But what is his story? I've never seen anything like that. I mean, I signed like eight autographs while he was rambling on and on about the Sadie's bowl of eight. Eighty. Yeah, eighty. It's for like it. I mean, he's a nice guy and all of that book. Yeah, there's something there that doesn't meet the eye. Well, he, yeah, he introduced us to Chris. It will always be grateful for Chris was great. And, um, but ever since every time he comes by, he gives me like a pamphlet for Sadie's buffet every time I see him. He'd have any pamphlets this time, did he? Monday night, just coupons? He had some table scraps from just today. Yeah, brunch. Did you tell him you've never been there? Did you tell him that? You don't have the heart. I didn't have time. I had four billion people looking for autographs and pictures there. And I'm getting like a sermon on the mount about Sadie's buffet and about the ropa-deez of the hours and you can do this and you're supposed to go at this time to be to crowd. Why don't you go up there sometime? Like on a Sunday or something? Let's check it out. Stay County, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? Okay, bud. Good. I went up Monday and I saw you guys I had a great time. Good. It was really great. I'll pay you that bird. I love pie and I got my Christmas goose a little early this year. Good. It's serious, sir. I don't know about that guy. I know. I'm thinking, munga, my shirt too. Well, that's possible. Very likely. What do you want to speak of fun? Yeah. Sound. Sound. Good. That's the way we like it. Hey, I saw the movie extremity. You saw it? Yeah. It was a good movie. I thought the ending was really stupid. They should have killed that guy. Are you okay if anybody, if anybody is listening to us and seen it, you just killed all of them. Okay, it's gonna give a voice already, sir. You know, they're gonna turn this guy over to the police and he's gonna get out with some wire on your wall. You know, and he's gonna call nice and film again. So I mean, what's the point of movie? I mean, if she had killed an idiot, I might show on it too. They know what a bit of going movie. What is that sound, you know? Right now? Yeah. You're really excited about this phone call, yeah. Yeah, some exciting eating, is that okay? I'm gonna go, you're, you're, you're more developed. I mean, I'm not a crazy fan, you know, I don't want to piece your body. Well, nobody else does either, Sonori, about that. Where are you calling from, by the way, that background noise is really interesting. I'm going from North Miami. Oh, I work. Well, that explains. That explains it, you know. And, you know, I just want to say, you know, I don't know you near OGIS. Certainly, that you're on Stan and I'm even for the bird and I'm not a little bit... Trillman. Like next time you make a big pot of soup, throw them in, you know. You guys are, uh, cold entertainers, what, what is the toast meaning of the word? You know, you're not these, uh, you know, Madonna, Michael Jackson, Superstar. You guys, 12 to 1st to 1st, but 4 8 hours a day. You bet. It's murder. And, you know, some, you know, many people in this world, but you entertain me. I'm a tough audience. And, uh, I just want to thank you for being here. Well, tell our management that, would you please? I mean, I think a lot of people... They have a motto here when in question, or in doubt, run in circles, scream and shut. I know. No, be, you know. Yuri is running around little circles in the HGM. Ah, the sky is falling. This guy in a calm down, relax, you know. Leave us alone. It's, uh, you know, there are a lot of many people that can entertain us. You know, even, uh, he's so cold comedians. They put on HBO and send him back. So, I mean, they're month. Yeah, you can say that again. You know, you are real. You mean, you know, I didn't really get to talk to you, because I got to a rain, I was soaked, and there was a no-in screaming. Well, crazy people around you. Yeah, there were a lot of screamers there, all right? But, uh, you know, there's a great crowd, and, uh, don't have to kind of people. I really appreciate what you would say and do, because, like I said, you know, I'd true interpainers. And, uh, there's no one that tells you, you know, the media or the record business or show business that can punch you. That really means that. Well, I don't know about that. There's some of them that could touch me, but I don't, I don't think I can... I can't go to a Canadian touch anymore. Yeah, now you're talking. Oh, this is a good call. Yeah, this is a good call. Oh, no. No. Now, Betu, did you put it on freeze frame? Uh, no, I'm not, you know, I don't go that way, but... Oh, listen, I saw I saw the previews for about last night with Roblo. I've heard of movie. And the previews that I saw, he seemed to be rather naked in most of that, like, where is it? Is it? It's not a good one, it's a great movie, but, uh, it's interesting, you know, it's a good action, and I'm in that... Good action, huh? That's what I like. Oh, Jim Belushi, he's really close and funny. Yeah. Which is right up, is no random white film, but, uh... Now, he's just playing out his brother's name, you know, and... Oh, hey, everybody plays on your brother's name. Sure. You know? Look at the bird. I mean Michael Jackson is playing out his sister's name, you know? You know, bad, and how his sister's body, too, but that... Oh, and, uh, one of us think you're getting to the rest of the day, what's the date of his day, is he? Yeah? Yeah, I'm telling you, a real nice guy, but, I mean... I'm not a negative one, I'm just gonna say I think he's kind of dead. I mean, if I was sitting there, I'd be like... They're ignoring me, so they're ignoring me. I don't hear me, so you're from his room. And you ignore it, they're all ignoring me today. I don't know what it is. You know, I mean, I just said you're fucked. Every time you put their jelly linels, they're gone, I'm not gonna be... The mayor's going to be on the other side. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, go ahead. What, what, I go to sleep at night, uh, you know, I got the clock lady of the clock, and I just... It happens to be on WF-H, because I don't listen to what I just need and ride music like you. So the other day, you went to have my laptop, and I was looking for a clock in the morning, and he was calling me as lead, and he must have gone into your... Somebody. Really? First thing I heard of, no. No! No! No! All right, you're on me. No! No! No! What a show! I'm for a white, unpaid radio, and be dry. Sure! Move it across the river.

It's a good call, or it's a good call. Couldn't agree more. I tried on call. Every point he made, actually, when he said you mong gone his leg or something. That's my favorite part of call. That's the honest show. Yeah. Well, I told you, was possible. Do you believe that they're doing cartwheels in the HM? Do you believe that? Why should today? It seems to be under control, and here isn't it? Where's everything fine? Why do you think that? A.B. any different than every other day? Manistana Halalahaze. Me call, hale los. Isn't that the name of somebody used to work for other God for your I think? I don't think so. I've never had any Jews working for him. That ain't it.

And a comment for the bird is if he would have had this day of on when you were gone to serve the day of bury, you might have had a decent bill. Yeah. And also I was going to have to bird. How he knows Michael Jackson? Because I noticed that when you play the beat it song, he talks about holding a Gwen Hill on his hands. So I think you have something that's going around. Glenn Hill disease. Yeah, you've got the one of those rare bird diseases, you know? Glenn Hill disease. Just want to lean next to you for a while. Well, okay, bye, Neil. Wait a minute.

Like this, you're going to have to be reading our minds. He's reading our minds. We didn't know that the operation was over yet, but that's exactly what we had in mind. Doesn't everybody want to have a stuffed bird on their fireplace mantle? And of course most of us in Florida have a fireplace, yeah. Oh, sure. Like, a fairer faucet. Yeah. No, that wasn't. That was LA, wasn't it? Where that movie took place? Yeah, LA. Yeah. You need it there, too. Ooh, look at this in there. Oh, you are going to just mung when you see this.

Excuse us for reading on earphones, but, you know, it's matter of priorities. Let's take a call from Broward. Hello. Hi, Neil. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Just fine. You were talking about a session before. I was just curious, and what your session was with the ice cream. A session? A session? Oh, I'm a session. A session. No, I don't have. I'm all over that now. Oh, you all, you've had your stuff. Yeah. We had, well, so to speak, yeah. Yeah. You had an epivisic cream. Yeah. I just curious if it was a deprivation of some sort. No, we're moving on to bigger and better things now. A lot of, for body wraps, I hear. Yeah. Well, you know, I hope it works out for you. I really don't go for those things. I really strictly go for calories and exercise, but whatever works for anybody. That's what it's all about. Why do you're desperate? You know, I've been on all these different diets. If you could see this dietetic cheesecake that I'm holding in my hand, even as I speak, you would absolutely go into ecstasy. I'm serious. It's got like raisins in it. It's an actual dietetic cheesecake. Yeah, you know what it's like? It's like, it's like, it's, no, seriously. Listen to me. It's like, strutal, strutal wrapped around cheesecake. And there's the other, I mean? Yeah. And it looks sensational. Oh, that's great. Well, I hope it works and I hope to hear from you on the radio about how it happened. Oh, you'll be the first one to know. Sounds great. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Okay, there's a little, oh, not on that. Come on. Oh, my God. If you could see this foul creature behaving like some kind of a nerd from outer space. How about on, uh, stands team magazine. We put it on that. Yeah. Okay. Just don't get it on, uh, what's your name's picture there? What's your name? That little three-year-old girl on the cover? They count, eh, hello? Hello? Now, you're going to, what happened to those forks that we were going to have forks? Oh, I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir. Don't, don't let us bother you. Um, I spoke to the verdict today because I was calling you, but you weren't there, you heard me last night. Oops. And it gets a really cute little laugh, you know? I like that. Really? Yeah. That's an interesting thing. You'll see it inside of it. This could be the big start of something good for you here now. Yeah. Listen, did you get the invitation to the strand? Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Didn't you call and tell them we can't go? No. No. Well, I appreciate it, but short notice, you know. Oh, okay. Then they have something on. Hmm. Wow. It's great. Ah. Oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Sir, I want to tell you something. What was that? I think I just died and went to have it. This is great. Please, cake. Wake up your taste buds. Wake up your taste buds. This is so good that it's orgasmic. This makes sex seem like just a little tickle on the toe. I'm telling you, it's just, uh, unbelievable. You can't eat cheesecake and have an herbal wrap too, you know? Well, that's not sad later in the week. Uh-huh. All things must pass, you know what I mean?

And they've been, uh, rowding ever since. Okay. You know, those green. I know. What a pity you were there. I wasn't going to tell them where they planted those, but I look at that. He's picking through it. They're like, they're raising. They're raising. Yeah. Yeah. Strutal has raisins in it. Is it yummy? Have you ever had apple strutal? Yeah.

Hello, welcome to WINZ. Hi. Hi. Hi, how was lunch? It is phenomenal. It is. Or gazmic. I right now am inspired by. By the career opportunities of broadcasting this site. I got three lunch on the radio. You bet. Three bees everywhere. It's great. I mean, I think I want to run out and become a broadcaster if some sort. That's why Stan got into what he and I just. not even understand they were talking about food though when they said freebies. Well, you know, you got to leave standalone a little bit, you know, you don't want to pick on him. He doesn't eat his lot of be left alone. Well, I got to listen to him in the afternoon, so you know, you want to keep him in a happy mood because when he gets to the bad mood, he's no fun to talk or listen to. That's true. He gets very, certainly. Yeah, sure does. I mean, what I noticed about your show finally is why I've been listening to the past few months. It's actually entertaining. Oh, you're finally discovered that. That's good. Discovered. I have been listening. And today I'm away home from school. I was saying, my, oh, my. This is a fun show today. And you guys are having a good time today. I can hear it's a good time for the rate taste of lunch. Yeah, I guess so, but let's not, let's not play that tape because now. No, let's boycott. Hi, you know, we're going to boycott him. You know, I wouldn't listen to him anyways. I mean, I haven't started listening to your station all day long now. Good. Tell the management that tell the nervous psychotic management that. I think I think we're going to send Gary for a head rat. Oh, I just haven't so much fun today listening. I know. I know. I just had to call in and tell you that today is, I think, one of the better shows I've ever heard really. But, uh, did you hear that must be because Davis here today, huh? He just figured it out. Yeah, I mean, it's just been so much fun. Yeah, Davis just, you know, good spirited souls here to eat a little and a laugh a lot, you know. Yeah, it's, it's a good show. It's, it's really great. I'll call the management for you. I'll look it up in the phone book. OK, so I just, I couldn't, I couldn't restrain myself. Oh, it's an attract me up every time as well as the other caller. I, you know, these these little tapes you have and everything are incredible. All right, now, want to make my last offering. I have one piece of this lift. I'm making it to Kyle. I'm telling you, trust me, saving it for you. If you don't want it, that's okay. I understand. But I wouldn't steer you wrong. OK, there's been a lot of food here over these last three and a half years. But I am telling you, my hand of the sky, that if you eat this, it'll make up for a lot of these calls. Trust me. OK, thanks a lot. All right, thank you. I'll read it there. Hey, bye. 2, 4, 6, 8, hike. By the way, Stan was a little confused yesterday, but it does appear. The networks are going to televised the scab game. Oh, yeah. I know. So those of you who've been picking and scratching out there because of the strike and are just healing up right now, you can kind of match your scabs to the ones on the field this weekend. Yeah, Gary was here from Dough and Digest about an hour ago and he said that the dolphins are definitely getting their scabs together. And they are going to play a scab. Yeah, they shouldn't heal by self. Let's get all the scabs in town together and heal them up for you know. He said it's good. We could get the earnest angely in here to heal up everybody's scabs by the weekend. Right. And of course, they're going to be just tremendous followings for that. I say a plague on all of them. It's going to be what? You know what I say what? It's going to be right up there with a renafootball, I think. Yeah. It's going to be right on the same level. Our resident sports, Mr. sports. And of course, you know, that's my favorite arena football. Yeah. It's almost as good as indoor soccer. Yeah. This I'm Tony and of course the tractor pull. I don't know what to say about this. Am I right? Am I exaggerating? You're not exaggerating. That's the best. It has cheesecake I've ever had. Didn't you have a little sexual excitement when you ate this? Well, yeah, I felt something strange happened. Yeah. Below. Well, just wait. Okay. It's a 741 at WI and Z. We'll go right back. Yeah. And WI and Z. And welcome to Bird Brain Radio. Let's take a call from date County. Hello. One of my favorites. Now is there someone there? No. You told me to just say fingers there. I want to tell you which one. Hello. Hello, Neil. Hi. This is the Annibra Ball Nancy Holly. Nancy, how are you? Fine. They called you for multi-U.I. heard. They certainly did. Right. I want you to know. The gentleman's name is with you as Dave. Yes. I don't need pictures. And you don't need to see him because as long as my family knows and everything knows that. That's not important. That's not important. That was a little shot. I don't know. I didn't know that. That's good. It was a little shot. I don't know if that's our way if I was there. I'd come down and show you pictures before and after. She didn't like what you said. Oh. No, no, no. You're taking him seriously. No, no. Yeah. It's just a radio show. No. But I went down. I'm losing you for some reason. Your ankles all the way up to your bus. I'm going to take everything. Yeah. And I did lose eight and three quarter inches. It was amazing. And how long? Just once. One does it. Oh, boy. One of the girls in the office. One her first visit. She was 17 and three quarter inches. Holy Toledo. And like how many times do you go back? I'm going back again tomorrow. But like it's all stayed off. It stayed off. And the woman that called. It said about the saran wrap. This you're being wrapped like an eighth bandage. Oh, I see. Like a mummy. It's weird. You look like a mummy by the time you're finished. Some of us already look like a mummy. Well, I'm not a mummy, but I look like a mummy that night. But they wrap you and everything. And as they unwrap you, you can see the difference. Really? It was amazing. My family thought it was amazing. People that know me looked at me one day. And then they said, what you doing overnight? I said nothing. And a lot of people don't know where I went. Of course, now they know where I went. But that's why I said it was the crazy horse. Hey, partying. No, just a joke, Nancy. Just a joke. I didn't hear it. I was said to the crazy horse. It's just a joke. Hey, I don't. If I was good enough, I could go on stage. I know. That's why I said it. Well, listen, where news is coming up. But I want to really thank you. I've got your letter. And I wish you the continued good luck. And I'm serious. If this is, you know, if this is it, I'll call you tomorrow. It'll be on stand show and leave the mess with him. I'll let you know it's my alternative. See, you're going back tomorrow. And like it last about an hour. You're in the wrap for about 50 minutes. And the wrap is uncomfortable because it's like having pads on and everything else. Because you look like a football player. But I'm so excited. You feel like a hockey player. But it's wild. But you actually can see in a immediate difference. Fantastic. Okay. Well, listen. Good luck in the check in tomorrow. Okay. Thanks, Nancy. Bye. How do you like that? I'll be darn. You sure will. There's no doubt about that. The whole world is what vote unanimously on that. That you'll be darn. Okay. Mike Wolf is back. How about that? With tomorrow, our favorite local and airy news headlines.

You see, Neil's lost in the burger last. Yeah, he catches on quick. Yeah, very good. Okay, listen, have a wonderful day and tell your partner he's a jerk, okay? Okay, guys, but you take a life. See you later. A lot of important questions of that man's mind. Yeah, well, let's go for it, huh? How did that line get on hold, I wonder, hello? Hello? Were you on hold? Yes, I'm waiting to talk to Neil Rogers. You're speaking to him right now. Hi. Isn't that exciting? That's exciting. I heard you guys talking about lunch earlier today. It was just, be on belief. But, just honestly, you know, you live in plantation I understand. Yes. And I'd run to let you know what happened to a friend of mine today. And myself, we went to a restaurant plantation called Oliver. Have you ever heard of it? Oliver? Yes, it's on. Oh, I know where it is. It's in a little tiny strip shopping center. It's on sunrise? Yeah, and now, University. Yeah. Well, we went there. We were eating lunch. And Oliver's we've enjoyed Oliver for so long for eating lunch. And there was a bug in my friend's soup. So we called the owner of the house? Did they charge him for it? Excuse me? Did they charge him for it? No, we ended up having to walk out. I mean, for the bug. It was so rude. Really? Oh, my God, it was terrible. Are you sure? You mean, there was a bug in a soup and they were rude about it? Yes. There was a plane. It was called tea broccoli soup. That sounds good. It was very good. That's a matter of fact. Until my friend said, oh, there's a bug in my soup. Well, when it made me not want to eat mine either. And we called the waitress. I've earned shelter. The waitress to do it. Yes, that is a bug in your soup. And I don't know if he ever was with no. That's not a bug. She found out to know it. And she walked away. So we called the inn, or again, we said, this is a bug in our soup. What do you mean it's not a bug? Huh? What was it like a look alike? It was a little brown bug. He was laying there on his stomach, which is makes. I mean, you can tell he was a bug. Yeah. And in the dead position, right? In the dead position, exactly. No, but I just think that people should know that this lady was just totally rude about the whole thing. And it's really ridiculous. She wouldn't help us. She didn't offer us anything. She said, she ended up saying, I'm not going to argue with you people about this and walk away. Oh, nice. Well, I guess you'll be going back tomorrow for lunch, huh? Yeah. We're going to go back. Because the math exercise, I think people should know that. It's just terrible the way it's just lady treated us. And they shouldn't go to Oliver's anymore. Okay. Even though their food was alright until then. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, I'm not going to get into it because, you know, I don't want to get into the soup with you. But whatever you say. All right. All right. Okay. Good luck. See you at Fud Rockers. Which is another story. Yeah. They stand online. Have you ever gone there? Yeah. And it didn't impress me too much. No. First of all, I wanted to have a... Well, not only that, but you go in and you see all that dead meat hanging in the window. That's weird. It gives me a good ad. Boy. Yeah, it's like driving by cemetery village. Where's the all that dead meat? It's kind of like that. Yeah. How the too much? And then you go in there and you're like, wait forever. Yeah. All right. You know, what's your name? Joe. Okay. Joe. We'll call your name when it's ready. Yeah. They call your name. They call out every other name in the history of the English language first. Yeah. In fact, I was in there. You're probably going to think I'm making this up. So this is a true story. I was in there and they called out there were like five people in front of me. And they called out five names and I thought, well, I'm going to be next right and a stick. A little mic that they got in there that you speak or system. And they said, they were, see, I have to go shopping downtown from my mother. She needs some tortillas and chili pepper. Unbelievable. So that's a true story. No. Well, listen, you got to use that for something. I don't know how to have a news that had so long since Jorge has been a quiet. The always reminds me of Pat Boo and when I heard it. Yeah, it heard very bad. Okay. I think we're going to take a break now. And then when we come back, the lines are continuing to just do a Mexican tap dance. Right on the phone. They're going to have a great mood. And they really are. Because David's here. Hey, you haven't been talking a lot, but you inspire them. Exactly. All the falls have been good. They know that you're here and they just light up their life. Exactly. Like Debbie Boone. Or a sunny would say like Grandma Boone. 19 past one at WINZ will be right back. Two past one at WINZ Davis here. Mr. Sports is here also. And we're just talking about some of the highlights of the Atlanta Bravesies in this year. What do you think that was? Yeah.

Didn't hear the beginning. But he was talking about, yeah. It's morning. He says something about it. If you say it one more time. What that sunny has a banana in his mouth. He'll be real happy. I think that's right. I hope you're happy sunny. Excellent. He's a vacationing with Grandma Boone this afternoon. Wait. He's always like a snack. You know what I mean? They're awesome. Why, why? Why? Why? Thank you very much. Okay, let's take what to be great if we get sunny and Elvis Jr. do what to do. Oh, oh. Why? They're a mumble together, baby. I'm real sorry I didn't get to meet him Monday. He's a good guy. You didn't come over and say hi. I'm real sorry, Mr. Who was he with? The shower lady. Michelle, the shower lady. Why. What a couple. Boggles of the mind. Oh, I'm seeing the Michael Jackson sock. Howard County, hello. Yeah, sir. Great. Had a good time meeting all you guys yet in night. Great. Got all your autographs? No. No, I said I go for by the bird to get his autographs. And here he's right, not a woman's book. Yeah, that's true. Oh, I'm glad this guy called you know, Stan is usual, it's so full of it. You know, then he said that we didn't write on her bosom. He said that we signed it right in the middle and then when he was a long story about how he was writing for a half an hour. Man, I'm Tony, I left in Delible Marks on her breast. No, here it is. And you know, I ask her why she said, that's okay, you know, so I was writing a sign. I had to help in the middle there and you're hand slipped. Yeah, well, you know, it's understandable. But I ask her how it felt to her. She may have been in the middle because she only had one big breast in the middle of a chance with bizarre. But anyway, she said she loved it. Yeah. I had to feel the saliva running down the smile telling her. That was drool, sir. I don't know. I had to get it. That was a long time. Yeah. When let her go, yeah, three year old. Yeah, it'll three or three. We're stirring. How long? I couldn't get near Sam. Yeah, he kept screaming. He's painted he has parents. Yeah. Sam was stepping down. He started with a jack and long sleeve shirt. And then he's got the shirt off. Then he's got the jack off. And then he said, you want me to take the pants off here. But now I'll keep those. Yeah. Whatever you do, please. Yeah. Hey, pop it up. Park open Thursday night. I know it tomorrow night. It'll be great. All right. All right. I'm going to be there plunging my brains out this year. You watch. Yeah. I want some later, I guess. Good. Well, listen, we all like to contribute to the breed, right? Yep. OK. OK. Are we going to the track day? Yes, several times. Really? Yes. Which one? Pomp. Hey. Pomp? But no. We'll have to go sometime. Absolutely. I'll show you how to lose. It's style. Oh, come on. You can win. Do you do any good? I do all right. I'm with someone that knows what they're doing better than I do. You like it? Yeah, it's fine. The track I mean. Yeah. OK, let's take a call from, no, seriously. That's great. Yeah, we'll go. Absolutely. Did you hear that? Yeah? They've just made a little date. It's a date. You want to start spreading some ugly rumors now? You want me to leave? Yeah. OK. He's back to the enemy. So how he is? He's so insecure. Yeah. But I can't see you. Something. Don't you know, don't you have, I asked this yesterday. And I think it went over the heads of a lot of our horny or callers out there. Don't you have friends? Just friends who are acquaintances with whom you don't have sex. And have no desire to have. I have platonic female friends. Right. Yeah. Platonic female friends. Yeah. And evidently Dave does too. Sure. He has someone that's got them very upset because he has these secret desires. Like, Chrisie. Not so secret desire. She called yesterday and he was just, I want to tell you something. He was doing more than that. It was embarrassing. I can't tell you. Yeah. Did you go to the mice spindle school of confidence? That's what he wants to know. Oh, seriously. I mean, you know, isn't that what life is all about? A variety of different kinds of relationships, right? OK. I'm sure. Right. There's all kinds. You bet. OK. I wouldn't you like to have Dave as a friend? Oh, yeah. I think you made your point. I don't think any further explanation is necessary. Just a friend. I understand. I got it. I got it. Right. I think he likes me now. Yeah. Well, now let's not look crazy. Dave County, hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Good. What's up, bro? You working Saturday again? Oh, yeah. I heard you were not very happy on Saturday. Working. No. I've never been very happy on Saturday, but they don't give it down. Well, you could take a religious holiday break if you don't kipper on Saturday. Well, Saturdays, you don't get to go for it. That's the day. You know what? That's great. Because that means this year it comes on a Saturday instead of on a weekday. So all of these instant Jews around here that take off on you, you know, high holy days, they're not going to get any extra day off. Well, you may not have any Jewish listening audience on Saturday either. Want to bet? I think you just gave me my show. I'm going to have all Jews in the first hour calling in. Well, which would you like some good silver fish? Please. And some potato lockies, too. Well, maybe just some gribbinous. You know, a little plateful of gribbinous. I haven't had those. My mother refuses to make that because it's poison. Well, by the time it got to be cold and rancid anyway. Not at my mother's house. So I'm talking to the studio. Yeah. That's how we like it. Cold and rancid. That's how I like my gribbinous. And that's how I like my men. Cold and rancid. Right. Right. Oh, fat. Fat. Fuy. It's like rice, isn't it? Not exactly. No. More like mung. Do you play the I-95 song anymore? No, we certainly do not. That's correct. That's correct. Okay. My secretary didn't believe it because I- I guess I must have heard it the last time you played it. Well, we only played it about 4,000 times. So, you know, regardless of what they think in Portland, I think we made the impact, you know. I know, but she never heard it. She said, well, yeah, well, that's why it goes. And have a nice day. Well, wait a minute. Are you there? Yeah. If she wants to send the Burtica set, he will send her the cassette with all those goodies we've got. And then that's on the tape. And then she can hear it and have it to play over and over again. Okay, I'll tell her that. That's true. Malatia the studio. Right to the bird. It's the bird. A 90 is best. A 90 minute cassette. 90 minute? Yeah, that's best. Okay. Then he doesn't have to turn it over. Exactly. That'll be terrific. Okay. Alright, have a nice day. Are we a judge? Yeah. Two-four, six-eight. Appreciate that, by the way. I appreciate you having given me more to do. I always am grateful. You know what this means? This means he'll have to bring more of his groupies and he'll be less than working there. He has never ever done a moment's work since they have known him. Howard County, hello. Yeah, the Iraqis place. Speaking. Oh, this is Ron Hachko. How are you? Okay, Ron Hachko. You know, we're meeting some of those, uh, temptation of silence and sandwiches. They are absolutely at this world. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Pardon? Yes. And no calories. Yeah, right. Yeah. It was, was now Kyle and my right was a good, you know, a diet. A diet? A diet? A diet with crab meat. What is that? All out of sight. The baked potatoes are really superb. Good. What is it going?
