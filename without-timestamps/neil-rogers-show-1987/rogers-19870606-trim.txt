You really have no kidney man. This is fair about it. That was your story. That was your favorite garden tariff in public health. So what happened to you give it a magazine? Yes, yes. I bet for 50 bucks worth of groceries, yeah. No, I mean, someone had sent it. But she hadn't heard you all. I'm seeing anything about it. And I wanted her and I said, let me have it going to ring this because I understand her. We'll take me to him. Yeah. I can say it's fun and I can't find a thing about the reaction is. The court kids beyond the question that I know what to say. I think it's against Burstie. I think they're all trying to make a shop at Albertsons. I'll close the up. The bed in the water said, there they're this. There's one girl said, let me see maybe I said you'll be interested in that too because I was on their back breast, but I guess that's kind of dirty to say. I'm the lady's only got to pick out a bit there. Even their sample ice cream cones and missing to us. Okay, babe. Maybe they ought to put them out next to the chicken breasts. I don't know. Okay. I'm just going to be on me. I'll be on somebody's father thought to make a difference. Yeah. Okay. Have a good day. You too. 26 before one and of course next time you go shopping at public. Just remember that FCC ruling. About in decent in decent see with the bag boys, right? And earrings and all the other stuff. Man, they got an excuse for everything over there, don't they? Okay. We have two up at lies in day. Four, 9,400 North Miami Beach, hello. Hello, now. Yes. Hey, I terrific program. But I'm listening to you for long time. Never pulled in but listening to long time. I'm a native here. Well, I wouldn't say a native. I'm a pioneer at 50, 70 years. I don't want to mention who I am but who public don't. But I'll remember that there's one thing that you got to have. Remember, every knock is a boost. And you're doing a hell of a concept of ice here. Show. And it's enjoyable. In fact, I'm sitting here only on a Saturday listening to your program and get my hell of a pick out of all I do for the war stuff. Yeah, they're off the wall, all right. And it's for living a must of all. I do some television work and travel all over the country and I come a contact with people from the East Coast to the West Coast, made America all in the New England. And your program is something else. And it's like, I can do things for now. Four dates. You're getting your great bang, sir. Yeah. Because the way you kind of speak roll up your kind of mind, your kind of way it is. You stick up your principles, your makes sense, amount of time you're, you know, you're far out. What it's, it's refreshing. It's something that you don't get anywhere. And, uh, Jesus, I'm really impressed. But I'm so sticking it out. It's so hot here. I'm wet like a pig. But listening to your program, boys, really something. I don't mind that. Okay. And, uh, you'll just keep on doing what you're doing. You're going to be very kind of icy. You'll miss people here. They don't agree with everything. Of course. You put it on. What do they know? You're different. Yeah. And this is the truth. I know. I don't recognize my voice. No. I call me the two of Shachi, Bunker. I get commisers with nothing but, uh, tell me, so I said, did my own commisers. Are you serious? Yeah. You know who I am, Jack. Yeah. I'll be bugging. You know, Ali from 20-day street, 37 years in one place. Are you kidding? And that's me. Huh. And, uh, I'm, uh, I'm not funny, Calib to myself. I could tell. But you are. I can't. I can't. I know. I know. I love nothing. I mean, based because it's probably coming to my life when I'm, uh, Well, nothing's perfect. You know that. Nothing is perfect. I've been as perfect. God. People don't even like God. Some people love them. Some people don't like God. Exactly. What the hell do they know? I know. They just a bunch of creeps. A bunch of mission go. I'm. That's right. Okay. You have a great life, sir. I get what I told you every night is a boost. Okay. Okay, Sam. Adios. How's the way go? I'm going right now. Okay. And in the course of things, after we had, and that was quite a traumatic thing for me as well. It's time. I saw the stars. There you go. Okay. It's 22 before one. I'm not even stopping the car's well today. That's how disjointed the show has become. Let's do our second break of the hour. If you're keeping track at home, the guys who have the subret hotdog stands are going to be selling hotdogs in the shape of the Pope's Beanie. They're going to call them Beanie Weemies. Nineteen before. Look at that. I think that's an omen. I think that just fell on the floor back there. Nineteen before one at WI and Z are next call in coconut creek. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. You know, this is another, I'm going to call it a disagree as this year. I enjoy listening to you every day. But I just want, I want to ask you a question. I don't want to cut me off. I want to respond to you know, you talk about the people that listen to you. I have super day art and the American public. It's down even at 240 million. And it's all. No, I didn't. I never said that. I didn't say that everybody's in the end or something. At all the time. That's the thing. That's what you mean to imply. Did you ever stop to think that maybe this is the 80s, not the 60s or the 70s anymore? And you're the one that's out of set. People are finally coming to their senses. Yeah. Well, the what are you listening for? Well, because I enjoy. I like to listen to you. I like to listen to you. I like to listen to you. I like to listen to you. Yeah. I like to weigh you cut people off. I disagree with you. 18 before one at WI and Z plantation. Hello. Hello. Yes. Oh, hi. How you doing? What plan was he calling? He said he liked the way that I cut off people to disagree. So I figured I'd give money wanted. So to speak. I don't know about the FCC. I've been looking at pornography while I'm talking to you. Well, the next time you go to public service, just keep that FCC ruling in mind. When you go to the meet department. You have to watch your meet. Is that it? Exactly. Oh, I got it. Those little old ladies out there who've been squeezing the meet at publics look out. The FCC inspector may be standing under the counter. That's right. Well, there are no cast institutions and publics. I was in Sarasota this week. There are no human rights in publics. No human rights. No human. The radio in Sarasota is pretty exciting. Oh, my God. Awful. I used to work there. You're kidding. 14 years ago I worked at WSPB out there on City Island. Doing what? What do you mean doing what I did a morning show? I was program director. I did a talk show for a while and did everything out there. I don't have anything even closely resembling a talk show out there. No. I have a lot of shows like Mike Reneri in the morning. We have guys picked their nose on the ear. That's good. Yeah, play disgusting music. And the FM's awful also. I mean, that's at Miami's great. But their idea of FM is light rock. They have all these stations that play elevator tip of rock and roll. It was awful. Yeah. Like the Hollywood string saying, playing I want your sex. Not well. I don't know about that. Not. But I'm out of that going on. Buy it out there. Oh, how bad can it be without the lyrics? You know. I don't think George Michael makes it to Sarasota. Probably not. Can I say? Yeah. I was listening to Craig Worthing when he was. Well, that's that's obscene in of itself. That's history. But I haven't had a chance to call you. And he used to be on. And he was like the most inane individual in the world. He would get a guest on why I don't know. And ask them about their shoes. Yeah. About the clothes they were wearing. Well, he's big into shoes and clothing. I don't understand. He gets them. People even sit there. They'll talk about a topic. And he talks about his dreams or what he did 20 years ago. I doubt that. The guy. I doubt that very much. You don't think so. No. Anyway. Yeah. He was moving right along. Moving right along. What? What other thing about the Alice and the afternoon? Yes. Is he getting ready to like come out of the closet or something? All his shows seem to be drag queens, etc. etc. What is his new shock type of programming? Yeah. He's a shock jack. He's a shock to listen to. I don't know what the story is there. I'm not really sure. It's kind of like one day the toys on the line. Remember that song one two over the line? Yes. Well, I think that ought to be the theme song. And I'd show. Can't say that on the air. No. Anyway. I really like your Tammy's favor. Yeah. That's a classic. I record or you'll die in hell or something on it. Burn and hell. That's their whole their whole ball game. Exactly. Give me money. I your way to heaven. Die and hell. Let me one last question. What is I know A-O-R? A-O-R means all over the road. Does that mean? What does what mean? What is all over the road mean? No, no. That's just my line all over the road. A-O-R means adult oriented rock album rock. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Okay. Great. Very good. Yeah. Thanks for that. May I do enjoy your program. Okay. Goodbye. See you in Sarah Soda. Goodbye. Okay. Gino is calling. He feels lonely. Who's Gino? Gene Stevens? No. Come on. Get serious. He wants me to talk about him again. Gene Silverman. Eugene Silverman. How you doing? Eugene? He's not really calling, is he? What does he want? He's on the phone? How do you know it was him? Was there silverware dripping from his telephone? Or was it just jewelry dripping from the phone? One of the other. Okay. That's fascinating. Hollywood, hello. Hi, Neil. Yeah. I was watching Blacks and I watched Jimmy Swagger this morning. And you know, you have to watch the enemy so you can come back. I'm having to know what you're doing. I had agreed to do that before I left the room. He asked the question, do you think I could ever come back to PTO? Go ahead, sir. Well, you believe that he had this chart up. And he was showing the enemies of TV evangelists. And he had pornographers. He had you, Minnes, and you know, different columns. Yeah. He had Thomas Payne. He had the Catholic denomination up there. Right along with Pernagre, for his in human life. Yeah, it's true. They were very down on the Catholics. You bet. Can you believe that? Yes. And not only that, he was showing all, you know, how the money is spent, how he spent his money. And he was saying that, you know, he was showing these South American countries. These people in South America, you know, flocking to the stadium to see him. I think they were probably passing off free hot dogs or something to everybody. He knew when he's. Yeah, right. And he says, yeah, even people down in South America, watch our show. And they had the cameras inside like these these straw huts. And there's dirt floors and there's poverty. But they all have a 26 in Sony. Don't you understand? A 26 in the country. Oh, come on. It's a matter of priorities. Can you believe that? Yeah. A joke. What are you joking? And you believe that the people at watch him are goable enough to believe that. Somebody wanted me to talk about jeans Stevens. If I have the guts, what do they want me to talk about? Other than he's a douchebag, what is there to say? I'm sorry. So I'm getting a message here. It's just unbelievable. I go ahead. I'm used to. No, there's nothing to say. I mean, I've already said it all about jeans Stevens. He's a douchebag. I don't know who you didn't steal. Well, I believe me. Nobody else does either. Well, if you don't like him, I probably wouldn't either. He's a misfit and hell and hell. Well, boy, that tells me a lot right there. I'm a president all. Does it all? Hey, but Neil, if you could, could you could you play that. Human gas alert? If you get a chance. Would you please? Human gas alert? Is that, you know, that one that the siren goes off on people. That's gas at that little sticky have there. You mean the worst alert? I haven't heard it till I heard it one time. And I didn't remember exactly what I was. But the point is, though, I mean, if you're going to ask for bits, you got to have the name right. So for future reference, I'm just stalling for time because I can't find it. I'll find it here sooner or later. It's called the worst alert. The worst alert. I'll remember that, Neil. Thank you, a lot, huh? In fact, that comes automatically on your radio just before the leaf I'll show you every morning. And afterwards, too. But I'll just be for Mike Thompson. Oh, here it is. Okay. Boy, I'll tell you, you chuckle just right up to it. Okay, have a good day. Later. See you later. Boy, a great killing hunt. Oh, Mike, Dave. At worst alert, we know the kid is avoiding household accidents. Early warning. Yeah, but where I just loop them beans. Oh, no. Come on, kids. Help me out with the meat, we're there. I hate the one thing. It was an object. When the worst happens, worst alert is there. Constantly sniffing the air for those silent, but deadly. Personnel here. It's the worst amount. Personnel, few, and detective. What, what in your office? Brothers. I need this 200 page report in one hour. What? An open, old window. What one in your car, do? I'm waiting for you to bring a parade of the bull, man. Hey, I beg you. Get automatically lowers your window. Close your windows. The worst alert. Personnel, few, and detective. Available now at Gas Modinal. Cheese, way so. I said, well, Jim, understand the assemblies of God are about to defrock you. Okay, it's nine minutes before one at WI and G. Let's take our last break this hour because I think we're finally. I tell you one thing. It's the one thing you know when people want to hear things. It's another thing when it become militant. You know what I'm talking about? And we have a couple of people. I know we have several people, I guess, for whatever the reason. I want to hear how in the old vise and the leprechaundom today. And I think what we ought to do is play them back to back to get those people off our backs. But I'm a little bit nervous because I don't want to stop these cards. And I'm not sure if Jerry has recued. I would be the disrespectful to him. And I'm a little bit nervous. Can you believe that? They both ended. That's a second time that's happened. It must be the work of the Lord. Both ended simultaneously. There to Miami cops with a hot dubious. There are the streets fighting crime. They pops at the hand you can't face there. You're your hero. In hell and they'll find. We're getting a problem. The great game is a cool trick. We've tended in that the group has seen your citizens who went around trying to get the early birds special after seven. Yeah, they're back and down. Let's go get them. Yes, I've been nervous. Clean out the streets. Hey lady, you can't cross here. You'll have to cross in the line. There's a term as we clean up the smoke in this piece. All right, sister, you're under arrest. Oh, so now you're arresting my wife. What's the charge? Station to powder. I'm going to have a first time. Let's see that white stuff. Yeah, just a dog. She's got over 100 bags in here. Both words. Sweet love. And that restaurant she just came out of. What's that guy man? He's there. He's there. Come on in my becomes. And I'll have to be. Here's hell of a deal. Vise. Today we're in this form on MBC. I'm very interested in the time of year. We're nearly one two week. It's a little bit higher. Say, Colleen, would you be wanting to come over to my place to help me relax my shellily? Ooh, now that I would market Patrick. If you be wearing the clothes. I know there's a smart lassie. Please make sure her lullaby's wearing the Kelly Green Protection of Lepre Condoms. Don't be wishing I'd afford it, Clover. I'll follow them for the gift of gam. Especially if you're planning on kissing some blind stones. Have you ever had your feet doubled in your protection? With the impression of this strong enough for a man? But I like them too. So kick yourself and dip the condoms. And you're worth be catching anything else? Are you going to be pulling my leg? Are you serious? Okay, I wish I could repeat that. I might repeat that on Monday. Five minutes before we want to WI and Z. We have somebody in a pay phone on countyline road. Hello. Hey Neil. Real up with the show. I'm just wondering. Yeah, real positive. I got a question for you. It's kind of a cubic service. You might be doing for the better. It's going to have to call the register back there. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You just got back from there. Post time isn't for another five minutes. Well, no. It's 12 30. The wind is open. Oh, I see other would you better? I went in. That's about to get out of there. Well, I can't believe it. We got an honest guy here. Didn't bet with his book. He went to the track in the advanced bet. I can't believe it. I'm doing it for a bunch of other people. Oh, well, that's okay. That's illegal. That's good. Oh, I know what I'm talking about. I'm going to go make all your bets for you. You know, there's just told me the names. There's what happens. There's a few horses that are coupled together. And I didn't. I'm not touching that line. But what does that mean? I mean, I can win. It's the same trainer, you know, if either the horses win or something like that. Exactly. Of course, there are. You mean in the Belmont. Exactly. That's the only race I've better. Okay, what are you going to? And let's just say, for example, gone west. That comes in or conchistorous comes in. You win, either. Right. But that just seems like you get like two horses to the price of one. You are. It's an entry. Because you got two chances, just like Leo Castelli and Golchard Lee Roy, Jolly entry, Tantista Rose and gone west are the, what do you Steven's entry? Yeah, because I like box also a perfecter. Cryptocurrency Leo Castelli, but also a good golf. You're back comes in with, I guess either there's two horses. Exactly. About that. Okay, so I'll be able to explain it intelligently anyway. Yeah, when you start, when you tell these people you have to tear all or tickets, I'll be able to tell them why. And tell them to hear a lot on the people. For if there's, if they go in with like the line up out of the paper, that it's Tully Wrong, he's going there and say I went to number ten. It's, you know, golf in the paper. It's Tully Wrong. So if there's any right, novice better. Well, those are by post-position. Exactly. And that's not how they listed in the Belmont program. So something. No. Gonna be betting on the Tully Wrong. More to take this cut there, throw a numbers round. That's true. That's why you got a buy a program. I know, you know, cost 50 cents is a big investment, but, but it's a good idea. Yeah, I just kept it in the day County, but now I'm making a mad You're right on the line, huh? Yes, sir. Just like those talk codes to hover on the line. Right here by this beautiful shopping center. Oh, boy. Just a terrible putty down. I'm getting out of here. Okay. Stop it. Well, cancel on the way by that. Change your luck. See, tap it in a minute. Okay. Good luck to you. Okay. They're all plunging their guts out. Man, that's good. He went out there early and plunged and got everybody else's money down, which is, you know, border line illegal, technically, but at least he admits it. Okay. So, we come back after the news break, we're going to really go nuts. And I have no idea what that means, but see, it always sounds good when you say that. Like, we're going to really have a, like last, what the hell, they wasn't. It was like two Saturdays ago on Friday. I said tomorrow, we're really going to have a wild show. Or we've got something wild prepared for you. I have anything prepared as usual. You know, the last few months, you don't prepare anything. You just come in and fly by the seat of your pants, which is why the seat of my pants are so shiny these days. She lorry can't. Uh, no, do I want to get into that again about these chairs now? Well, it's too big of a story to cover in the next 30 seconds. We'll save that for Monday about lorry can't in these chairs in the talk studio. I mean, several of them at the same time. Anyway, we will come back at 106 in the course early Sunday. Neorodges. Yeah, Arlene, I was a one at the watered up that stupid crap and put it in the waste basket. Okay, honey. Can we get her a little therapy before she does the next update? It's 106 at WI and Z. I'm telling you, we've got just incredible. I mean, during the week, it's wild enough, but on the weekend, it's just like I got a control out of control. Like I really have a lot to do with the programming of this radio station, right? I have everything to do with it. You know, anything that go when it rains outside, it's kneels bald. Everything is kneel. Now, I guess we're supposed to forget about the numbers and about the ratings and about listening. We're not here to build an audience. We're here to be a little fraternity, right? Of course. To be just a little psychotic fraternity. And I certainly qualify because I'm a psychotic is almost anybody in a building. I do underline almost because there are some in a class by themselves. Okay, we have one open line at date county 624 9400. 624 9400. Miami, hello. Hello. Yes. Neil, your defensive freedom of speech and self-expression with the FCC is very lottable. But I can't understand. It seems inconsistent with your concern about the folks coming or about selling souvenirs, what's the difference, he has. If they sell souvenirs for his visit, what's different between that and selling Bruce Springsteen pictures and people. What's that difference between selling souvenirs when a pub comes and all those little souvenirs that they sell on the PTO club? Well, you know, if it's a argument that you have though about if you don't like the programming one can turn it off. I didn't say that we're starting a campaign to stop. They can do any damn thing they want. You know, I'm making a joke out of it. And you're obviously taking it very seriously. We can find a music in itself. Well, it maybe it is amusing, but it's really the people whether you believe in them or not. You know, they sell a little souvenir posters anytime of visitor from his real come. No, they don't. No, they don't. Yeah, they did. They sell a little flags in the. No, they don't. Any time a visitor from his real comes. Well, I don't mean to Miami. I mean if they come to New York when when when I'm not in bacon or seen the, No, but it's your when you come over. No, and they don't let the kids out of school when man awesome bacon comes to up or when you talk, shamir comes to New York. They don't let the kids out of school. Are you jealous because they do? No, not jealous. It's got nothing to do with what I'm jealous. It's ridiculous. It's a violation of separation of church and state. I mean, you're approaching like a child in my jealous. It sounds like you're all upset about it. And oh, yeah, sir, I'm so upset about it. You know, I mentioned that. What do we spend about two minutes on that? Well, at least two minutes. When is where things can happen and you turn it off if you don't like it? You don't buy it if you don't like it. What is that cut to do with letting the kids out of school when a Pope comes? Well, if if the kids if people feel that the kids are going to get something out of it, find anything. What are they going to get out of it? Just to go. They're not are they going to get out of it? Get worse things. What are they going to get out of it? You know, it sounds a lot like you're not. You don't want to have a conversation. You said if the kids are going to get something. I asked you a question. You pretend you're deaf. What are they going to get out of it? They're going to get out of it. The kids going to get out of it. Others used to say when the Beatles were new. What does that have to do with getting out of school when a Pope is here? If the Beatles were coming to town, if they were still together, they wouldn't be out of school when the Beatles came. They're there, they did. Oh, sorry. Sir, please spare me the pain, will you? Everybody in the audience, you all remember when the Beatles used to come to town? We used to have a school holiday, right? So all the kids like when Elvis used to come to the convention center. Did he ever come to the convention center? Could be who knows? But certainly if he would have, we would let all the kids out of school. I mean, this guy is just totally irrational. And taking it all so seriously. That's a bottom line, pal. The whole thing is a big joke only. We just don't want to subsidize it. And thank goodness that the school board in Broward County and the, Superintendent of Public Schools has enough guts to say no to the Pope. You know where? First you get down on your knees. That'll with your rosaries. Go your head. We have great respect. And take your flag. Take your flag. Okay, 112 and WI and Z. We've got most of the lines are open now. And of course, that's the kind of day it's been. Not that we haven't had a lot of calls because we did earlier. All the most of them were really depressing. But the audience today, man, they're just, they're on the rag. You know, I don't know if it's the Vatican rag or which rag it is. But they're on some kind of a rack. We have an open line in date, 624, 9400. And our new, new number in Broward is 524, 9400. Deep throat. Hello. How you doing, dude? I'll see. We don't get any meal here on Saturday. So I'm sure it'll show up on Monday. Oh, I'm released. I hope it shows up on Monday. I've also got Jack's dirty. We're meant to on there. You might be able to use. Good. That was long. Oh. We're got about that one. Yeah. Okay. Well, it sounds like I'm in for a real treat on Monday morning. Hey, look, I'm going to call back after this show. I'm through my first time a call there. Really? Yeah. I usually play highlight. And I usually win. I'm going to call her. You got any, you know, I'm going to give anything out today. No, I don't do that anymore. That's right. Okay. Well, all I can tell you is I like the Deliroy Jolly entry in the Belmont and it's not going to pay anything. Okay. I didn't hear that. Leo Castelli and Gulch. Don't keep. But it's not going to pay much. That's okay. One of the pay's my son. Wait a minute. I see perfect parade is running again today in the eighth race on the grass. Okay. Look out. All right. Thanks, Neil. Okay. Good luck. I can't believe that I happen to have the entries right in front of me here. I'm not touting anything, but I gave him out last week and he won. Rather easily. And it looks basically like it's the same field again or at least a lot of the same ones. Textile a Joe and per play ho a beat him before. Long and exchange Canadian winner pretty much the same field. So look out in the eighth race. My name is hello. Hey Neil. How you doing today? Okay. All right. Well, it's amazing. Some of these people that call actually probably have drivers license. I know. Geez. You know, speaking of the Catholics, I just, you know, I went to Catholic school in Ohio. And my buddies, mom used to clean up the rectory or wherever they lived, you know. And she always used to find all kinds of used rubbers and I mean, use condoms in the, in the way spats gets it stuff. And none's used to drop out of school be a pregnant about 25% of the priest were gay. Which I don't have anything to do with. I went away. What percent about 25. Oh, man. It's, you know, which is five with me? That's a low figure. Let me tell you. Hey, you know, speaking of maybe 95% well, I didn't want to go that high. But 25% like New York gay, which is five. And the funniest thing out of all there was the head done. She was the principal of the school. The head none. Yeah, the head none. What kind of meat to pre-seed on Friday? None. Moving right along. Okay. Any other, uh, head none there got knocked up by the basketball coach. I just thought that was funny. It could be two old, two old goobers were good to do it. The head office. Well, have a good day, Neil. What did she give birth to her little basketball? I guess, yeah. My mom told me this. Hmm. Okay. Well, it must be true then. Later. Okay. It's, uh, 1118 at W.I.N.Z. But it's, I feel like I'm on, uh, what about 33 RPM today. Like the show is on 16 or something. You know, maybe it's just me. We have it open line in date. Hmm, it's 624, 9400. Somebody said that he saw on entertainment tonight that Pat and Anita will be doing a music and promo tour for Anita's book rising from the ashes. Well, that's exciting.

Why can't you ever get these things out? If you invite you to come on here and you go on and on and get into everything except the meat of the matter. Why can't you ever get to the point? You're one of the biggest obfuscators. You just dropped his smoke screen. It's cloud. Right. And hang it over the truth. That's like I've just come and write out and delaying it on a line of being a concise and precise specific. Do like they do in the newsroom.

And you ought to see what's going to be in it. A free sample. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm beautiful. Let's get serious. He did a show. He did five hours on being buried in metamusal or something. He wanted to be packed and metamusal. You should have seen we come in this morning. And there's a Mike stand. Oh, well. This big, grotesque. Like a like a crane. You know, with a mic on the end. Like a crane. You know, like you put on those. That was just like you put on a filter fish crane. Through the realm of the scientific. It was there like that. It hooked on the end of the table. You notice how Rick had we put these four holes in the table. And it was this big ugly. It's like really a lamp. Is it a fan magic? I see us. No. It's like a lamp. Well, who put who's putting all this yesterday? There's this big electronic microphone. Maniac Rick Edwards. The corporate chief engineer. It's called job justification. When he comes in the town, he's got to mess up something. You know, they don't know what he's doing on the payroll. We've been wondering for a long time. What he's doing on the payroll. Is he still on the thing? There's been millions over in the panel. They can't check the Saturday morning. Let's, they spent millions over in Penelis Park to improve the signal. And somebody over there, I don't want to mention Bob's name. Told me that all the signal now goes into the bay. They're big in purpose. In dolphins in Tampa Bayman are number one. They're number 16 in the market. Out of the out of the. And the fish don't even listen on purpose. It's the only thing that they can pick up. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Now recapping yesterday.

I do know everything. He told him that our lean was going to be a lot of and Gary Lawrence's office over the weekend. See if we can't come or down. Told her everything. Yeah. Told her everything. Yeah. I did not. Why are you saying that? I didn't. Just for the height. Yeah, I know. Because you're a yenta. We're trying to cure you of this compulsive gossiping. Right. You're in cr... No, it's true. You know, admitted. What? You have a problem. A problem. Yes. You're compulsive. You just chronic. I can tell someone yesterday. You're in the same tool chair. I can tell. Very sick. You're going to be here after this week. You just started. No, this is true. Is it true? No. Is it true? He is a master in office. Yeah. Is that what I'd like to say? Same. They would call it a liar. the president, but in your case we're trying to be nice. I said we call it obfuscation. Why do you think people tell me all these things? And I don't even know. Because they know you're going to repeat them. I know it's just an accident. So they just accidentally. He just bumps into information. He can't get out of the way of it quite a bit of turmoil and radio yesterday. Oh, yeah. Well, I know that wasn't my own. Well, that was an improvement. In fact, even now, I disavow any of the rumors you're going to hear about 20 minutes from now. Me too. But let's hear them anyway. I guess about. When I first we have a commercial break to do, we shall kill three minutes. I'll thank God. And then Ernie is going to come along with, well, that's true, Glenn. Uh, 20 minutes before two. I'm telling you, we got all these paranoid old bags, all these bitty's out there in the audience, all these yentas. And of course, you want to talk to him, because that's where you get most of your information. You're next. I thought I thought I got rid of Kathy West to get you in here, isn't that the popular rumor? Yeah. From those old bitties with all their old wives tales. Did you see Linda thought it was Alta Colbert's case? Well, somebody was just asking me that she was on web. Most complimentary about Neil Rogers, she said, you're the first AM talk host that has actually brought young people to AM radio and that the ratings of Fantastic. Never know it today. Just glowing, glowing reports. And never mentioned my name once. But in Don Webse. Don Webse. Gee, that's nice. Was he a talk host in this? He is. He is now. Oh, are you serious? He must have hired and rehired so many times. There's an explanation. But he's not there now. Yes, he does. What hours? He's overnight on a weekend, like one to five in a morning when all everybody's sleeping. I guess he did. He did overnight when Craig Worthing was doing afternoons. This is an exciting industry. You know, someone's about a tube already. Yeah. Yeah, Don Webse talk about pseudo intellectual. He brings in a rojace to sorrows. I'm serious. And see how many big words he can use. He doesn't even understand what they mean. And then there was a woman on this show last night with you. You know, who she was that was doing the interviews that she was screaming at her guests, just literally screaming at them. Oh, so I'm raised in narrative. Is that, yeah, she's done very pretty, lady. Yeah, Mary. That's on's what? Is that real? Is it a system? No. It's a system. But Linda was most complimentary. Oh, what is going on here? Are we having a private tea? Oh, boy. What does it say to tell you? Have you ever been to a tea? No. I've been to a tea. I've been to a tea. It's just a year. Big one. Luxe, breakfast. He's like that. Never been to a tea. You know, who that was? No. Your friend. Oh, why are you calling him that? Food cake. I know him about his wife. I'm going to call him. I'm going to your friend. He's going to be a real busy for the next couple of months. I would like to go on his vacation real soon. He is the one. He's the one. He's the one. He's the one. He is what he knows. He knows what's going on. And if he says something, I don't question him for one moment. What do you say? See? There he goes. What did he say? He said Glen Hill is the one that gave me all the information. He did not say that. Did he say that? No. He did not. You know what the plural of the answer is, Glen. No. Adossa. That's good. That was your knee that said that. What you're going to finish the Jewish guy, right? Yeah. Why did you ask for my magazine by the way? What is it? Cosmo? Yeah. It had something in here. Do I want to ask? I got some naked breasts in it. Absolutely. This is the June issue of confidence. I tried to do a whole show on it. Yes, sure. But I had no takers. Look at that. These are the girls that need to enhance themselves. Would you believe? How to build a better? This is the magazine. How to build a better mouse trap? That was the caption under the Pat Boone picture. How to build a better mouse trap? Well, that's about the size of it. Yes. This magazine was taken out the shelves. It's several public supermarkets. And when did you come along with the salon? I'll just leave. And this is the right. Never mind. Are you going to tell us the room? I'm going to go concentrate on the TV. I'm going to get into my show, which is too exciting to even bother with you. I think we'll just make it with this. There are a couple of their three pair of breasts. They come in pairs, generally. Yeah. I see that pair on the ground here too. Yeah. But do you see any reason? Would you stop majorizing quite well? First of all, you've got to leave through it desperately to find it first of all. So what difference do you have the magazine on the shelf on the stand? You would have to look through it. Because my copy automatically opens to those pages. Oh, but how do you tell you? Are you on a disease? Oh, phonetically. You want to look at the human shows. I'll show you. You don't have time to leave through there. You're going to have Marie capital where you were yesterday. We were starting all this. We were giving all the gossip. The rumors that we heard not from fruit cake. Yeah. All did not come from kids. Turning into a real. He was right on a borderline. You know, if really, really were accepted, we were about to accept him into our hearts and our minds. And every time you're on the verge of doing that, he just absolutely can't control himself. I'm not that bad. I love to give him credit. He loves to call it. Oh, it's kind of blind. He needs serious. I heard him on, but with Dr. Meltzer the other night, did you hear him? He had him in 2015. More Meltzer going for about a half an hour. And I don't think Meltzer ever realized who was the best real following. Like, terminal cancer. Yeah. So, yes, picking up where you left off 20 minutes ago. We gave all the rumors yesterday. You were here for part of it, or any of you. I got a photo of it. I got a photo of it. I got a photo of it. I got a photo of it. New WIOD lineup when what's the name joins him in July? Right. And we, and you said something about Miss Patons, called Dr. Leaving, her kind of, it expires I think July 11, right? Something like that July 9. And Mike Miller will be gone. Got them all upset over there. Mike Miller is going where. PLP. Look, taking Bob Lashitor's place. Okay. These are real rumors. Now a really rolling. Well, anyway, as I understand a part of the big strategy meeting they had over there yesterday at WIOD, part of the discussion, Neil, was they wanted to put Sandy on with Reneri in the morning, a two-person show. And Reneri. Shaker Cookie. Oh, Michael Shaker. Reneri hit the ceiling. Yeah, I imagine. It's retin' to quit. He must be on the nervous break. Now, just having to do nine to ten. Yeah. So, quit if they put her on with him. That's the latest. Yeah. So, they're not. People not go on in these in the morning. What about the smooth story? Well, not way to make it. But what about the rest of the lineup? The rest of the story is Paul Harvey would say. Well, we covered that yesterday. What's the same Steve will do? Ten to two. And what's the same Paul Lyle? I don't believe that. Well, they do. Even Mike Anthony's not that stupid. Oh, Lyle. He's Paul Lyle has been, all he makes Ron Saxon, like, water crunkite. Okay. Where is he now? He's an actual, just a, he feels any of this financial news. He's got just a terrible voice of no personality. He's pathetic. Perfect for IOD. Yeah. Like I said, well, he has been offered the two to six shift in the afternoon. By whom? My fruit cake? Uh-huh. Fruit cake called him up at home last week. This is a true story. No, he did. Oh, and he said, you better be prepared Paul Lyle. He said, you better be prepared to do two to six to get off you. I hand it as that part is true. I know that for a fact. And he can deny it from here to the end of time. I know it's true. Because I was sitting there in Paul's house when a call came in. And then from six, then they had to spot things. Sports talk for five. Caller or Sylvia. Will is going to be trapped there at night. Yeah. From whenever or at the ballgame ends, he'll three in a morning. Yeah. And what about Snow's? What does that know line up? Uh-huh. Wait a minute. Let's do our last break. It's 12 minutes before two here on Yentah USA. We'll come right back. This way. All right. All right.

Everybody get ready. Stick your finger deep in your throat. And let's go. I'll be all called out. I'll live. But the suit with no mouth. Even though I'll ran, Tellerips, I thought, I'll have me all shows. But then there's the foul line. Who's show gets worse by the hour. It's hard to figure out which way I'll let me go. Push in the woods to find good talk radio. Okay. That's enough. You're rid of that. Okay. The embarrassment factor is too great. Okay. When we left you last here on Yanta USA, Can you imagine this going to be bigger than entertainment tonight? Good be. Could be. Huh? He doesn't have the legs of what I was ringing. Did we miss it? I'll must have been that psychotic kid again. Okay. I'm sorry. When we left during the break, you were right where you were Paul Lyle's house in the living room. That you while frukek was calling. That was your fearing in business again. Yeah, right. Boy. I'm telling you. What a great science. Joseph Gacky. I'm here to want you to.

He's like, you know. Let's see. I think I'll move this guy here. And his mind is no quite doing it. He knows. He knows before the people in the show is a Gacky would pay serious money for that child's home address. Show I got it too. And Joe has all of that sports equipment. You know like hockey sticks.

He was looking at him and Paul was saying, If you just cough up a few more bucks. I was not. That was it. That was all the new room. I already told it. You know about the Sandy and what you were about to tell us about snooze. Oh, well. You just remember that Sandy could easily pop up on W snooze. You know, Lee's been after her for a while. So we hear. Yeah. And I don't know just to just myself personally. I wouldn't be surprised to see Mike Miller go over there. But that's I've heard of you. Are you serious? I have heard anything. Mike Miller at W snooze. I have a feeling he may have gone to the one. He may have seen a call letters to W loos. I wonder if W L S and Chicago would give up their call letters. W loos. Of course they're already doing that. Yeah. I don't know. That's that's just the latest. I'd love to get them up. So it's W K A T is anything happening. Oh, yeah. Let's do it. Let's do about five minutes on that. Any a Jack McDermott. I ripped him this morning. Did you know I read Tom's column this morning in its entirety? You know, Stan a music man is a nice guy too.

He gets all bent out of shape because he came in there with a bird. They were challenging one another and how much donation. Yeah. Yeah. Totally forgot what it was all about. Yeah. He goes to the apartment. And the thing about a Jack McDermott is such a jerk to begin with. Nobody even knows who he is. You know, he called me and you know, said he was against your so far. Yeah.

Belmont. The third one. The third one. Where is all that? Belmont message. I'm really not into horse racing. I never have been. You know, you and Tony Sugretta would get along when you're upset with tennis. That's all you know is from tennis. But only to what to play it. I don't even enjoy watching it. I just don't enjoy sitting back watching tennis or even basketball. Everyone's all excited about this. I like that. I'm not excited about it. I'm just glad to see the Celtics loose. Yeah.
