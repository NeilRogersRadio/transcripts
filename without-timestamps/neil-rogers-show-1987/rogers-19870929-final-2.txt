Yeah, Mr. Greenworks and if it doesn't work out, you can leave. Is that fair enough? I leave. I said Mr. Green doesn't work out. I'm the one who leave. Oh, Dave isn't leaving. When you meet him, you'll understand why. Just go get him. It's 20 minutes past 11 and done. Well, listen, now we can't bring all ugly people in here. Okay, once in a great while, just a humor me. Bring in somebody who looks human. Okay? I mean, there's nobody in this building who looks human since that engineer went to Tampa. We don't want to miss this name. He gets very emotional and all his family starts flicking limp wrists. And I mean, just they can't handle it. You know, even his wife, 20 past 11 and wins will come right back. If you have American or European antiques, they could be worth more than you realize. Now is the story. Okay, now let's try to bring a little order and decorum to this show. Okay, Dave is here. You got a lost probably. Am I right? Do you get lost? Right. Bad directions. Who is that Kyle? Kyle gave you bad direction. He doesn't care. No, no, don't don't use turn on him too already. Everybody's turned on him. All right. I'm still on your side. Hi. Okay. Yeah. Now what's Gene in doing up there? She's up there staring and land is up there. They've got half of the staff staring in here. Do you approve? I mean, is he okay? Is he all right, Gene? Is he meet with your approval? How many fingers? Oh, she's checking him out. Okay. He's turning around. She says fine. 10 fingers. How many? Now on a scale of 10. Scale of 10. 9. Oh, 9. 8. We got a 9. What's the follower got a three-step? Three-step. Yeah. Well, how do you like 10? You give her a 10? Oh, she's nice. Did you want to do something with her now? Well, we're doing the show. I mean, if you guys saw, she's afterwards after the show. I'll tell you what. She's busy. Well, we'll talk about that later. So anyway, you brought Dave in here and your hostel with him already. I want the audience to understand. Is he hostile? Pull that mic up to him. Don't just leave him sitting there like some kind of a nerd, you know, show him the ropes. Um, talking to that. But don't eat it. It's just don't eat into it. Well, I want to sit over there and kneels to you. I want to, other controls. Is that right? What do you mean you want to sit over in this chair? Yeah, you got a nice one. Like in my lap? No, not in lap. We can switch places. Yeah, right. He just came into the room and he's taken over the show already. No chance, Dave. Maybe tomorrow you can sit over here. All right. Is that okay? Yeah. I mean, talk about a pushy guest. See, this is not like Paul who was, he's the opposite. Paul was like, um, laid back. Is that the expression? Are you going to continue harassing my guest? Are you going to continue putting everybody us the bottom line is see the problem I got now is that I got two people in the studio. Both of whom want to be the only person in here. I don't mean with me. I mean just without me. Am I right? No. You're wrong. You're wrong. Now, what would you do, Dave? What would you if you just sat here all alone? There was nobody else in here. What would you talk about? I had talked about you. And what would you say? Uh, only good thing. Oh, yeah. Look at that. He's wencing. Look at the expression on his. He was wencing. I didn't know what was coming there. He probably, uh, repeat some of those conversations. He had with Brian and Josh at the ice cream store. Now we want to talk about that. They were that fan of. Yeah. Hopefully he's not afraid to tell people his name now. Who's that? Brian? Why is that? I don't know. He says he's embarrassed to tell people his name because he is. This could be all worth it in the long run. Yeah. I like this one. I like your drag into it now. I like the direction. Get a real obstacle in that. You're kind of a turn of the right. He's embarrassed to tell people his name because of me. Yep. Why? Let's calm up and ask him. Is it school? He's in school. Do you want to take him out of school? He goes to Nova. Nova high. Now, get him paged. No. Now, now let's not do that. Little tacky. He might be in the middle of biology class. He's got something important learning something. Or gym. Yeah. Gym 102. Yeah. So what else Dave? I don't know. What did I miss? Did I miss anything? No. We're not waiting for you. Yeah. Waiting to follow your lead. All right. Let's take a fun call. Okay. Brower. Okay. Brower.

I came across that the old time tunnel TV series. Remember that? Yeah. Well, this episode, uh, Bill, he pinned to a James Honell, for James Downey, and Lee Mary, whether to take him to the tunnel back to the 50s. That's really good. That's how we get to the door yacht. All of a sudden, I'm getting cold chills up and down my backs. I think it was called Escape the Afterday. Yeah, Escape to the Dark Ages. Right there. Who is it? James Honell, toppling to the tunnel, and he's going to talk up to. What's the new one? Ben, incredible. Okay. It was not a happy anniversary meal. It was late last night too. You were there?

I think I have a banana in your ear? Yeah. Jesus Christ. I saw Sonny Fox this morning. He had a spare banana. I'm like Pepe Seals and drag. Well, I heard that Paul you're a boy. I've first standard. You heard that call about the young lady on the beach. It either one of fixing up with him. He went through this whole thing. It was Pepe Field. Huh? Perfect. Little too young for Stan. I went to ready to write that. No. Mr. What do you want? I know you're so sick. I'm by a bed. You can eat all you want. Yeah. Just on smell. I know. Oh, this is the same guy that called about Pepe Field. Let me explain something to you. You're the same jerk that called about Pepe Field, aren't you? Yeah, you jerk. You want to go back to the Rower's? Yeah. Rower. Rower. Neil. Yeah. Yeah, it's the bird there with yours. Yeah, for lunch. He's here at the... Are you listening to the show or what? Yeah. Well, let me tell you. Who do you listen to come out of my car? On the one turn? Come call you. Okay. Now, real quickly, I'm a royal listener. I've been listening since I don't know if somebody told me about you months ago. And I've been listening to you for that long. I just want to know. Is there some way to get you to take your show on the road? Well, there are a lot of people who would like to have. You know, actually, Toledo and Oklahoma City and places like that. No, I'm not really talking far away. I'm just talking like maybe up to Coral Springs, not to Pe August. No, more like the Melna de Pah. Yeah. Yeah. I get a few plugs. No, I'm not calling for the Melna de Pah. Listen, we've got some really cute kids. And I just thought maybe you'd like to come out. No, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Cute kids. Well, we understand how that sounds. Yeah. We have some very nice young help. seniors and juniors in high school. Uh-oh. Very good looking young men. Really? Yeah. Very fine looking for Stan young women. And I just thought maybe, oh, we also have a very healthy treat for you. We have a diabetic ice cream. Really? Yeah. You also have some help for like kind of in between for the bird. Uh, yeah. Well, we have a college aged young person. Young young thing. Is that about right? Sounds good. I don't know which way the bird goes. Is she looking really good? Real boyish? There are two qualifications. They have to be boyish and goish. Boyish and goish. Yeah. I don't mean either one of those. Don't listen to this man, sir. Trust me, sir. Anyway, I can case you wanted to. Like, layman. Take your show on the road. How about Larry's up in Carl Spring? Well, you know, we, this is a true story in Carl Springs. In Carl Spring? All right. Let me tell you a little bubble mice. Okay, but it's a true story. Okay. Saturday night, uh, stand, of course, being in one of his usual desperate moods. Said, let's go up to the ice cream. Dry said, okay. You know, I always have to humor him. And of course, uh, somebody might have been working there anyway. So we go up there and it was crowded. And there was, we went inside, but we realized we're going to be a long way. And we're not going to stand online to get nice cream. So why don't we find out this Larry's place that everybody's been talking about? And he thought it was like right up the road. Like in Tamarack. And I'm driving around and we're looking and we couldn't find it. He said, well, I think it's just a bum steer. There is no such place. There is such a place. It's at the corner of Atlantic University. You know where this Larry's ice cream? Yeah. Yeah. It's in the prom-nade building by Carl Square-Mau. We have a Carl Spring's expert here in the studio with us. Oh, very good. We looked at him. We brought you up a little early this morning, didn't we? Yes, this morning. We got him up a little bit. Oh, he's so I'm sorry. I apologize. Go ahead, sir. But anyway, in case you ever want to come up there, like Saturday night, we're going to have a real nice crew on. And I'm going to be there myself if you want to stop by. Really? And I'd love to have you in stand-in. You see, it's one of the first ones to show up. You know, for example, last night, you know, all this talk like letters that I've been reading before. You were unbelievable the crowd. I came back. I came back. I came back. I came back. You guys up to the place that had a help. I'm a human. I'm a human. Excuse me, sir. Okay. Thank you, Dave. You know, I really wanted to help you treat me. I helped you. Yeah. So, you know, I just felt, you know, that I would come up. And I didn't fight you. But with the crowd, it was there. It was phenomenal. It was unbelievable. Unbelievable. Right. I was dying to say something only moments ago. Like last night, when I went in, I got one scooper strawberry ice cream with some marshmallow. You know, and that was it. And I went outside and I started signing you autograph. I never got to eat it. I had like three bites. Mm-hmm. So, people who carry on about well, you can't go to all these restaurants in eat, but you're eating ice cream every night. The amount of ice cream that I eat, you could put in a fimble and have them for the Chinese army left over. All right. Understand that. But like if you'd like. I just want to, I just, sir. Don't get defensive. I just wanted to clarify that. Okay. I understand. But no. It's really, it was really, you know, I really have to put it to your credit. Because you had a phenomenon crowd. We did it. And they were all wonderful. I've come to the conclusion that the people who show up, the silent audience out there, they're the great folks. The ones who call, you know, not all of them, because I don't want you to get upset. They wanted to call. I primarily opinion the ass. Not, not Dave called a couple of times, but that's only after we made a moustache. Oh, okay. Am I right? That is that. Absolutely. The melting pot. Do you know him? No. He's a wonderful young man. So he never told me. He is Friday. I love his delicate dressing. Friday. I think his out of this world. Friday night at nine p.m. By the way, it's going to be nine. Is that he had? Did you hear that? Friday night at nine? Nin p.m. We're going to, are you going to make a reservation this time? Because we'll be there. I promise you. Okay. Well, I just said last year I think maybe we'll just make a reservation, too. Well, sure. Wait a minute. Let's slow down. Did I tell you to cancel a reservation? Do I tell you that? But he is right on the floor. Gluttered. Yeah. Friday. See? Now did you hear that? Oh, I know the truth comes out. See? But there will be an ad coming in this. See, that's because you're up in crawl springs, which is halfway to Jacksonville. It's far. It's far. Come on. Play it all. Come on. I'll leave the road. Listen, I want to tell you. I'll leave the player patient. Sure. I live in plantation and to get to crawl springs. I have to take a freight train. Okay. By the time I get there, I want to steal it. He used Kyle's directions. You probably right. Kyle's. He sticks around Pemberg Pines. He's the one who's ready to stay close to home and I can't blame him. By the way, he has control over turning your mic on the floor. So it's a very nice to come out because he's only got a couple of days left on this shift. And then he's the band and he's, you know, the whole deal. It says he weren't paying any attention to the directions. That's what he's writing on a screen. Okay. Were you paying attention? Well, when he said left, it was supposed to be a right. All right. I got an idea. How late is this pain in the ass ice cream stir open that you got? 11 o'clock. 11 o'clock. We're going to be eating at nine. Nine. Nine. I'm going to have to do that. Talk to the finder. Oh, yeah. That sounds a lot better. Yeah. So maybe I'll make you a deal. Why don't I bring it to the melting pot when I go there for dinner? What, Friday? Yeah. Okay. Is that okay with you? So I was making sure. What? Maybe that. Okay. It says it's okay. Dave says it's okay. I'll probably get fired for saying that. It's okay. Okay. We'll look for you. Okay. Okay, Moishi. Okay. Bye-bye. Mr. Food. Right to catch. You know, what are they just bringing? Are you hungry now? There's a little too early for you. Well, I just woke up. Yeah. Why are they setting pizza's over? Pizza's on the way. Don't you love when these people come in here? It's like, you know, what do you want? You know, what can we do for you? That's basically what it is. What what is it we can do for you want lunch? Lunch is what we want. Or is it too early? We could order it now. Yeah. And like in about an hour, you could work up an appetite, right? Right. We could help you work up an appetite. Right. We could make your real hungry. Right. Maybe Elvis Junior would call. Nett and last night for the first time. You really have music. Great. I'm really upset. I didn't get to meet him. He didn't come over to you. He was, uh, it's about his daddy. Every time I got that in, he had that, uh, young lady was in the shower with him, nothing. He did have a picture. He was really good. Okay. But he had to go out for a little, uh, yeah. He's fine. I'm sorry, Mr. 23 before noon at W.Y. And the day is with us and sooner or later, we're going to bring him to a crescendo here. So to speak, we'll come back right after this. Okay.

It's kind of interesting, but Dave's only been here like 20 minutes and he's already given 72 hours. What's this okay? That's all right. Just like how's getting writer's cramp from putting him on the lawn. Okay, go to the carer tractor and they all know about me now. They all know what about you. Did I find another radio and I'm like a star now, Neil. Yeah, probably because he is. But you're not, you're not, it doesn't bother you. You're not thin skin. Like some ice cream scoopers that we know. That's not what you call it. It's just a radio show. Nobody's going to touch you here, right? Probably he's going to attack you. Right. Just a joke. Okay, just a show. And you understand that. I understand that. That's fine. It's like a soap opera. Right. Or is he slower or what? Okay, let's, where are we thinking our next call?

I think I'm back from big kids. Wait a minute, I'm going to put you under the light. Hold on a minute. Let's put her on over here because that sounds like hell. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. I live and I co-round there to vacation. And my mom got me hooked on you. Wow. And everybody in my family listens to you. When I just wanted to tell you that I would cure up here. No, not me. I don't like Albany. Uh, kind of dirty and cold. Thank you. All those hills and, oh, it's just a nasty town, yeah. Yeah, a lot of snow. Yeah, already, probably. I wanted to stay for Monday night, but to meet at the ice cream store. Boy, it was beyond belief. Was it? We had an pouring rain. We had over a thousand people. Did you really? Yeah. Well, I wanted to stay by the name of your child. Not listening to that. Yeah, that's what it sounded like, Debbie. Well, maybe we gave her an autograph for some, yeah, or a hard time. Yeah. My grandmother listens to you. Great. My dad listens to you. Wow. Did you do that? Yes, he doesn't sound. Your husband. Have one of those. You don't have one? Yes, don't listen to me. Yeah. Good. Well, that's good. Stayable. But when are you coming back? I'll be back in December for the holidays. I just become like about once every other month. I got a good job up here. Anyway. Boy, no kidding. Okay. Okay. Well, listen, it's great hearing from you. Give my best to all our good friends and all the name. So well. And Governor Cuomo, give him a big kiss for us. Oh, okay. Bye. Bye. Thanks, Debbie. Bye-bye. Well, that nice. Yes, very. We're big and all the name. I have to big and date. No. Okay. Let's go to Browner. Hello. Hello, Neil. Speak. Say hello to Dave. Somebody say something to me. How are you doing? How you doing? What's your name? Paul. Paul. Paul. Paul. Yes, no. Mm-hmm. Huh? You missed that. I missed right. No. Go ahead. I'll tell you what. No, wait a minute. I'm going to put this gun. You don't have to answer him. But just put him on three when I punch one up. Put him on three or four. This one's on there we go. You're there? I'm back. Okay. Because it sounds better that way. Then you can actually hear what these people are saying. Well, go ahead, Paul. Dave, whatever your name is. Hey. What's going on? No, now he can hear you better. Because so we stuck him in your ear here. I was at the Co-Pro Cup a week ago. And I think I know who that mystery person is. Uh-oh. It's the ambition of added drag. Close. But not a match. No. No, no. There was also divine there. I got the two of them were so much so close together. I can't tell who would it was. Not quite. Your serious divine was there, wasn't he? Yes. War wasn't it. God. The first time I was there at the Co-Pro Cup, I got really trash. It was like six years ago. And I ended up dancing with the divine. It was something that I'll never have. Oh, God. You're Lord. God. Do you know who divine is? No. Good. Something to tell your grandkids about Paul. Yeah. Out, right. Anyway, are you cute, Dave? Excuse me? Are you cute? Am I cute? I don't know. Yeah, he's cute. I don't care. I'm going to tell you what you have up. 12. Sounds good. Trust me. But he's a nice guy. You know, I mean, outside, listen, I got to get this audience over this insanity. You know, this obsession with this external beauty, okay? I'm not thinking about that. I mean, there's internal things too. You know what I'm saying? I'm, you know, I'm, I'm thinking of it's mine. You know? Well, there you go. Now you're talking. I twist it around and I mean, like, can everybody look like Jeff Striker, for example, of course not. They want to check that out. I mean, Jeff's probably, uh, a moron, you know what I'm saying? Now, however, come on to show because I said that. Talks like one. Yeah, he talks like kind of a goofball. Yeah. Anyway, which I got out last night to see if I could get a little bit of a working show. I mean, just because we have all these Jeff Striker pictures in here and now, you know, probably won't hear another word from Dave the rest of the show. I'll fix her that. Yeah. You're mad. No, nobody brought that in. Some, uh, disgusting, pervert brought that in here. Nice. Okay. Well, listen, is that it's her? Are you speechless now? I'm, uh, looking through my own pictures of Jeff Striker. I'll bet you were. You sound like you were breathing a little hard when we punched up the call. That's why. Anyway, Dave stopped at an Albert's and deer film and say hi to Paul. So. All right. Are you going to do that? Huh? Yeah, I'll be there. You can have a busy skate. Now, don't, don't say like in different. You might make some good friends through this show. Right? Right. Unlikely, I know. Okay, Paul. Good luck to you. All right. You're humor them at least. Will you come try? I mean, you're, you're, you're wearing me. So why don't you bring some of them? Um, okay. Where do we go, Dave? Dave's. Okay. Whatever one counts to put on. We'll let him, uh, you know, do a little something. Get involved in the show and he's waning days. You know, do a little something for us before you abandon the ship. Hello. I didn't mean something that little. Okay, there's nobody on that one. Let's try another one. Hello. Hi, Dave. Oh, yeah. I want to take. Who is this? I don't care what you look like. It's like inside it. What do you think? Is this a male or a female? I'm a boy. Somewhere in between, I think. Yeah, and they, so. Can we do anything for you? I think that was the wrong question. Yeah. You could give a lot of something. Yeah. What's your name, sir? Ruggie. Who? Reggie? Reggie. Nice talking to you, Reggie. He's so. Excuse me? He's so, Reggie. He's so, Reggie. He's by. He's by. He's by. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I think it's going to be Dave's last appearance on a show. He's already got one put out the door. And I was like, you know, they're always going to be a few like that. At least one. Okay. Where are we going? Some brown, where are we like? Okay. Hello. Hello. Hi. You had more people at the Ice Cream Store last night. It's been the Polka on this table of art. Yeah, we did. You know, we didn't call it off because you're rain. Yeah. We did it and said all of our prayers and brothels and everything went on as usual, you know. And everybody brought their babies for blessing. Yeah. Yeah, we baptized about 50 people. I have a reason. It was very reminiscent of the Pope. Yeah. You know, I thought about that. One of y'all people showed up. It was throwing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm glad you made a mention that the external beauty isn't. What it's, blind is gorgeous. I mean, I had to go back for a couple of exercise and cone. Yeah. But nobody's home. Well, yeah, that's a very good way. He's a nice kid. I mean, let's not see these are just innocent bystanders. Their people who are not interested in being celebrities. Now, Dave here, for example, wants to be a star. So he's put himself on a line and whatever crappy gets you'll have to take it. But these other people are just innocent bystanders. And if they don't want to be celebrities, far be it from us to, to interfere with their lives, right? Yes. Well, he is Dave is trying. I mean, I'll give him that. He's trying. Well, I'll let you know later how hard he's trying. You out, so to speak, or. Yeah, I bet you'd like to be here with him is what it's all about. Isn't that what it's about? It's, but that's impossible. But I don't know. Yeah. It would be more fun just to talk. Because I don't want to get you really nervous because he makes Brian look like quasi-modal. He's actually the hunchback of Notre Dame. Uh-huh. Okay. True. I mean, I don't think I wanted to ask. Did you want to be done? No. Whether report last night. No, I didn't see that line. Well, he said that it was discussing the probability of rain. Yeah. There was a good chance we'd get nailed off and on. All my, I had a hard time to believe in. Oh, boy. It's a good thing. Brian didn't hear that. I tell you, the weather report is something worth turning on these days. They let. Yes. Okay. Well, listen, have a wonderful time. Good to be there. When you give, go back for ice cream. Give them all my best. And we'll see at the melting pot. Are you going to, well, listen, are you going to come up to the melting pot? Friday night, nine o'clock. Nine o'clock. Cool, spring. I don't know. It's on Sample Road. Yeah. Yeah. I had to have to find a baby's better. Call the ice cream store. They'll probably, uh, spirit somebody that might work. Okay. Yeah. Okay, thanks. Bye-bye. There's a baby. Go on, go on, go on. They're giving me some big baby. Good idea. Now maybe we could call, uh, California for a day, with a later on. How I could speed all on a fly. Go on, go on. Which one? I don't know. We haven't figured that out yet. Yeah. You are a little, uh, mysterious. You do understand that. Am I really? Yeah. And we don't want to pry. Yeah.

So what were your, uh, most lasting impressions of what you saw last night? Hmm. No, what's the name? What's the name? Out there. Why, now why would you say that?

Thank you so much, Jay, and the have a wonderful life. Now that's new material. Hello. Hello. Hi. Um, this is my second day of listening to you. And I was wondering why, um, queer people are sounding in and talking to the days. Why are queer people calling? I think they sound like, like, big, you know what I mean? Fags? Yeah. Like, I don't know. You mean, like, fagalists? I don't know. I'm not going to pretend to sound like a girl. Well, maybe he is. How do you know? He's a guy. Maybe he's a little girl. Or goyish. For I feel so for days. Why? I don't know. He sounds, uh, oh, uh. He sounds what? He's me? Tell me? He sounds what? I know the word to the star. I don't sound good over the radio. Is it a daydive? Yes. How you doing? What's your name? Tan. Tan from where? From what? I'm just visiting here. I'm there with some Canada. Oh, that explains this call, yeah. Okay. And there are very homo, you Canadians. Very homophobic. I know there are no, uh, homo-sexuals in Canada, but that's where it goes. No, let me say he's divine. Is divine? Is this? I know you. Nice guy. Now, he's not a guy. He's a fan. Yeah. He's a Canadian thing. Wait, don't like Canadian people? Oh, some of them, you know, like, uh, the maple Leafs. And that into hockey. I know. Okay. So, what is it that we're doing today? Are you upset? Are you worried about him? No, no, no. Just, you know, I know I feel back from because you guys are in front of him. But how about all the other? How about you? But how about that? And how about the young lady that just called moment ago that was salivated that was drooling on the phone? He's got whatever he wants. Don't you? It's like it. No, it's like a smorgas board. Don't you understand? In other words, whatever turns him on, whatever he wants, the sample, it's all there. Like on sample road, you know? You want it, do you want the fake guy's phone here? Or do you want the phone here? Doesn't matter to me. Yeah, so he's flexible. That's what we try to explain. He's just a guy. He's an easy-going guy who gets along with everybody. Why are you up tight about that? What's wrong with that? Isn't that wonderful? If they want to call me up and say that, that's not a house and care. If it helps them, he's delighted. Okay, that's good. And if we helped you, we're delighted. All right. Are we going to see him Friday? Are we going to see him Friday? Are you coming up to the Melting Pot Friday? Do you have dinner with us? No idea. We're the Melting Pot Friday. It's on sample road, rural springs. Okay. 755. 636. Okay, give it a shot. Okay, enough plugs here today. Okay, we're going to pause now. If anybody wants to bring a little lunch by a little later on, because Dave is a hungry growing boy, that would be okay. Mike Wolf's got the headlines. CBS has the world news, including all of Sponsor. Very good. Neorodges. Probably seven of the WIENZ, and Otis who is conspicuous by their absence. But, yeah, not in the room. He said it was going to live. You know, this has been behaviors been very, very peculiar. Yeah, something's definitely wrong with him. Yeah. You have noticed that, haven't you? Strange. I mean, always strange, but today, a ZAR. He's a little depressed about some. Yeah. Maybe some of the line-lip. And especially two days in a row that we've had, you know, just, yes, listeners pop in here, and just sit in on the shows. Like, no big deal, right? Right. Wouldn't bother me. No way to be found. Now, maybe Brickov, Brickov, Oven, will send over, you know, a little something, because we do have a celebrity guest in the studio. We might, you know, and I'm not going to overdo it after that big speech before about the show. Just speech before about being forspread all that food. You know, maybe a couple of little pizzas and, um, any pasta or one of those big CDs and some stuff like that. And, be available. Thank you. Okay. Now, it's great expense. We're going to play this. Yeah. Boy is one with Xilomor, Xilomor, Xilomor, you know, when I'm not my best one, Xilomor, you know, you're petting and pawing, tearing at my breast. What? Someone who's win, someone you can, someone you want to underplay. Someone to fall on, someone to crawl on, someone have a way. What? That's in the morning, that's in the morning. Covers at my knees want rotten conditions, as if the vision I am a trapping wind. Someone who's sleepy, someone who's keeping nothing into days. Somebody first hands, someone to first, and then go back to sleep. There is nothing I like better than a jalfa now and then, with the hands under the sweater and the back that starts to bend. But before my eyes are open, I don't want to have too high. From a simple turn, still poking with the dimmole of pride. We're both one, Xilomor, you're being fixed in the morning. Soiling the she, Xilomor, you're being fixed while I'm yawning, suddenly falling, when I'm half asleep, someone unconscious, somebody not just waiting for a thrills-wond There is nothing like a lover who can satisfy your needs and the joy when you discover Just how often he looks these, but before my eyes can focus I don't need him to surprise Why does sending lies alone kiss on a field of sleeping fun? The boys want sex in the morning, sex in the morning, when I'm still not fresh Something that strikes them, someone who likes them, under the wind there's mud Someone who take, and someone who break, and comment on their plans Someone who prod, and someone who nod, and then just close her eyes I think that's the last time we're going to hear him on this show because they're not even doing the New Rogers Theatre right in the morning anymore. Do you listen to that station? No, no. Do I want to tell us why? We don't want to pry, you know, now I have sex in the morning. Okay, listen, see now he tells us that it's after noon. Now it's a quarter after twelve. Okay, let's take some more calls, Davis here. There's an empty chair and from what we understand The buildings around the building that the birds beak is in the view of the position. What have we done? Can you explain it to me? I have no idea. I mean Paul said right in the seat that you're in yesterday was a very nice guy He was a little nervous when he first came in and he loosened up a little but I didn't say a lot He ate some lunch which he had a grab away from the sternur at over here And that was about it. There was nothing and we had a good time. I don't recall anything negative about to show what's so every day. Nothing. Even the callers were good, which on this show was a miracle. And he's just, I'm telling you just absolute rective day. And we haven't even got a cacolot of him. Maybe you got him nervous. Is that possible? It could be. I think something happened last night till him actually. Because I noticed that when he put his hand on your leg that he was starting to get tremble. Okay, let's take some more calls and we'll just press on and if that's the way it's going to be, that's the way it's going to be. You know, these emotional people I can't deal with all of it. Hello. Hello. Hi Neil. Hi. How are you doing? Sharon, how are you? Okay, I'm sorry. I wanted to stay out for a while and get to talk to you but it was so insane there. I know it was. I couldn't believe what a scene that was. It was great. It was really good. We had everybody had a really good time. There were so many nice people in one place at one time. That's right. It was really, really a lot of fun and Glenn was really nice. Well, I know more. Not anymore. He's made a quick turn. You know how they say the worm turns? Yes. I think he ate a few of those worms at the ice cream store last night. Tell me how Dave compares to Brian. I you weren't listening before were you. Oh, I came on his share. I said that Dave makes Brian look like quasi modal and a bad day. Oh, well. Yes, he's a very nice looking young man. He's got a very pleasant personality. He's flexible. He's not afraid not to embarrass an uptight. He's very extraordinary. Did he get to speak to Brian last night? In fact, when we leave here, I'm taking him home for a little chat. What's that? Did he get to speak to Brian last night? Brian was not what you'd call in a friendly frame of mind. That's too bad. No. I tell you who's and I don't want to start getting into a whole thing and rehash or killer has or any of that. But one of the nicest people up there is Michelle. I must tell you, she's a just a beautiful young lady and very nice personality. She's pleasant. She's friendly. I get the feeling that there's some of the people on a one-to-measure name. Who are a little uptight about all this like Dave said. You know, the famous they're embarrassed and are afraid of letting by know who they are and all of this other stuff. And you know, I can understand that they're kids. Oh, yeah, that's true. They are kids. But it was such a really warm, nice crowd. They're minors. They're like, Dave at least is 18. Okay, you know what I mean? Yeah. Like there's a line that you draw there between 17 and 18. Right. You know, like the law. No, I mean seriously. Like those people are kids. Where is Dave? Dave is an adult. He's a man. So to speak. Did you try to cook these I gave you? Oh, those are killers. Oh, my god. Shame on you. You shouldn't have done that. You know, I just wanted to try this. You can't eat only 10 of those. Let me tell you right now. Those were just devastating. Okay. Good. I'm glad you liked them. I'll try to make them up to the melting pot Friday night. But we listen. I guarantee you you could bet your life on it. If we have a tornado, we will be there because I wouldn't let Dave down. Can you make Dave? Can you make reservations? I don't want to go to the airport advance. I would make them as says possible. Okay. Real good. Friday at nine. Don't forget. Okay. I'll be there. Have you been there before? Are you with their last week? I went out and he's there. I just went there and looked for you and they said you were. What good is that? They want you to come and spend your money. They want you to come and eat. Somebody was there who ate and was looking for us. They said it was fantastic. Okay. Just come on. No, we're going to be there. Don't say whether we're there or not. We're going to be there. Trust me. Okay. I'll see you then. And only if Dave waits on us. That's absolutely. How do we know that you're going to wait on us? How many waiters were there? I don't know about eight. Well, how do we know we're going to get you? Um, oh, we don't. Well, of course you're going to get me. You just request me. Right? Really? Okay. Do you hear that? I heard that. You're going to be my only table of the night. Oh, you see that? Hmm. Thank you. I'll listen to you. Can I get to sit with you at the table? Yeah. Does there anyone I can do that? Yes. Okay. Because I like you. Okay. It's very sweet for me. Are you not bringing any of those boyfriends or anything? I'll just bring my husband or I'll come myself. Oh, your husband. Yeah, that would be okay. I mean, you know, for once make it legitimate. Okay. I mean, this is the only, you know, I don't want to say tramp would be a terrible word. Oh. Just a joke, Sharon. Come on. Okay. All right. Great. It's great talking to you, Neil. All right. So what should we do? Should we make the reservation for, because I don't want all these other people want to get in the act, because we can't do any more, you know? Okay. But we can certainly have dinner with you. Okay. Sounds good. Okay. You're Friday. Thanks. Hi. How do you like that? Unbelievable. Is this going to be exciting or what? Yeah. It should be a great time. Should be fantastic. Yeah. We'll set you up in a great big table. Great. Yeah. We'll come in and chop the fun, too. They've probably been strained yourself. Okay. All right. Because I have a lot of great lines for that. But it's a family show. It's a family show, you notice this chair empty empty. I don't want you to feel guilty. I got a good idea for you. Wu Bo Renett chair. Because all day yesterday, Paul wanted to sit over here. to sit over here and I said no the bird sits there. See pretty soon I'll have right over here. No but you sit there and now it's that's a hint isn't it? Okay. Doesn't this feel better sitting over an inch here? Yes. Yeah better position.

We're just close friends. Yeah, but I just want to tell them that you're really good. She, I'm getting, I'm getting some mixed signals here. Like, he said you were real close. And he smiled like, um, you know, like there was something there that, uh, you know, now Michael, I'm just joking if you listen. Now I'll be giving you. Oh, well, wait a minute. Oh, boy. Now, see, now we've reached a point in the show where I think we may have no, nowhere to go back to. You know what I mean? Okay, listen, it's great hearing from you. Okay, Neil, I really enjoy your show and I have to see a Friday night. We'll be there with Bells on. Yes, you missed you. Thanks, Krissing. Bye. Bye, bye, bye. No, we'll be there. Trust me. You'll have so many people there. You won't know what to scream or eat a banana. Don't you fight it bizarre that he just kind of waddled out of here and, um, look at Carly's having, uh, his sterics. He's going into a coma from all of that. Just waddled out of here and he just never will be seen again. I mean, what is his story? Mr. jealous of what? I think we need to have a talk, you know, like, let us all. No, don't you think we need to have a talk with him like about the birds and the bees stuff like that? I know, seriously. I'm not joking. 23 past noon at W.I. and Z. Dave is here today and the other, uh, thrown is empty, but life goes on. Well, we have bowling on Monday night. I used to be a good bull or that may come as a shock to you, but I used to have it to 180. I used to bull him three leagues. That's better than me. Back in my Michigan days, many years ago. Well, Neil, we have a league on Monday. But I haven't picked up a ball in years, sir. A bowling ball at it. So it doesn't matter. We have a league on Monday night. It's gay bowling. Gave bowling? Oh boy. About 160 of us. What do you guys do? Bull side saddle or what? No, no, no, it's a lot of fun. I'll bet. And we've all, you know, we've all think it's a good idea for you to come. Now I want to ask you one question. How many holes are there in the ball, sir? Uh, three. The conventional three. Very good. That's excellent. That's bigger, typical. Keep all your fingers on, keep on. Good. Anyway, I think it's a big good idea for you to come by maybe you got least one, but then you'd probably like to invite Dave to come and bowl in the league two. No doubt, but that's not a pizally, so to speak. Oh, you don't have to be gateable, you know. It's really. Uh, both bowlers aren't gay. Is that a fact? Most bowlers are what? A gay? Oh, not gay. No, I'm not gay. Well, I'm glad you said that. I thought we're going to get into professional wrestling. A bowl of bowling, all you know. You know, let me say something to you in all seriousness. Okay, and this is nothing to do with you. It just came to my mind and now is a good time to say it, okay? All right, on the one of the thing, no, I want you to listen. I want you to respond to it. One of the things that people in this audience, many of them, including the dirtiest, minded, sickest one, the ones who think that I'm the pervert, these people don't understand. It's very possible to have friends and not have sex with them, isn't that right? Absolutely. For a four example, all of the straight males in the audience, who got male friends, okay? They got a lot of friends. They don't have sex with them, but they have friends. And some of them are good friends, okay? The women out there who go shopping with their lady friends. When they go home, they don't do what does, let's be in dilidate. I mean, they're just their friends. And it's, life is in rich. For example, Dave here is a nice guy and a incredible personality, which I can't believe. He's just too almost unreal, that he takes all of this. And it doesn't phase him. You know, he's just an easy-going guy. And he's a nice guy. But does he flake? Come on, see, there you go again. See, he got a stop with this, all right? In other words, I would love to have 20 friends just like Dave. Now maybe one of them, of course, you know, you always watch them. You got 40 friends like that. No, I don't know. I know friends like, I love these to think that every guy, I used to do so too. We were sleeping. See, they're in there, you go. And of course, every single, I mean, even the friends of mine that still are, you know, they think that, well, you know, what are you doing? With this guy, you know, be careful. Yeah, what are you doing? Exactly. You know, be careful with all diseases. Right. And in the meantime, you're probably worth doing anything. No, no, it's a matter of fact, it's like, like, maybe three, two, that I even introduced the mob that I have. It's a bit more than right now is only one. Yeah. But, you know, it just goes to show everybody thinks like that. If you're gay, you worry. One moment, even, but even if you're anything, but especially gay, I guess, but anything. I mean, like Stan comes on and he does all this thing about trolling. And yeah, okay, he's desperate. But in the meantime, well, I shouldn't use him as an example. I think that was a bad example. True. But anyway, back to bowling. Okay. Come on, come, come bowl one by the way. We've had Brian up there. Alice has been there once. Brian, I. Brian. Brian. Brian. Brian, are you? I'm not a f**k. Oh, my gosh. I'd love to have seen that. Ha ha. It was wonderful. I think she did neighborhood weather from there, but that's the point. And you had Alice out there? Alice gave me the very same Alice who was at the Copa in this picture? What picture? The one from the weekly news that I have here are the picture from the Copa with these other two very amazing looking people. Oh, no, I missed that. Yes, I have it right in my hand. And the Dave is rolling on the floor looking at it right now as I speak. I have the right up and get that. It's the September 16th issue of the weekly news, page 39 in the upper right hand corner. Oh, blow it up and send it somewhere. All pants. So, you know, if you play middle of the night, I think it's very name-alope. What? Monday nights. I mean, at that night of clock, you can come bowl one game. Pickable ball. You still have your bowling ball? You've got to be kidding me. Why? I sold it, okay, when I was unemployed, I sold my bowling ball in my bag. We have a house ball. We have house ball. I'll bet you do. I'll bet. Anything else that could be interesting, you know, that we all- Well, I'll give it some thought. No, you don't worry, Dad? No. Okay. Well, why don't you tell me that would be- There's a bunch of Dave because Monday night we'll have a hundred people show up and see what the... Wait, what's wrong with that? You're right, it's a vertical. Some of them might be good. At purple Monday night, it's at a clock. And it's a lot of fun, and you know, you don't have to be gay. I want to say that. You know, it's a matter of fact we have... Well, okay, I won't be. Okay, but if that's what you want, I won't be. I'll stop. I'll just stop, it'll make a lot of people happy. Yeah. But think about it, and you know, it's insure up one Monday and give us a throw. Okay, so to speak. But first big. Okay, seal it. Hello, when you ball. Thank you. Thank you. Call 34 at WI and Z. We've had everything from bowling to incest today, and we're moving on, we're in upward. Let's take a call from Broward. You want to? Sure. Yeah. But you just agree, I will see. I get nervous. No, I really do. I get nervous. People are so agreeable to everything. Like, I have the feeling if I asked him seriously. Would you like to... I can't say that on here. I mean, like anything. You just... Just... Have you always been like that? Okay, we'll take one from date, yeah. Now, we're going to take it from Broward. You have to find a spot at which to, you know, take control back of the show. Broward County, speak to us. Unbelievable. I know it really is. It's a good time. Okay, go ahead. Hey, dude. What's happening, dude? What's happening with you? Hi, Dave. Hey, hey, Dom. This is John. John? John? From... Spring. Oh, oh, hey, Dom. Do I know you? Oh, it's an awesome spot. Broward, you're nice.

How you doing, John? You're good. Probably come back off Broward, you know. If Neil's going to be out there, and he'll be there. You'll be there. Definitely be there. What's that sound? The bird will not be there, though, by the way. The bird. You know it. Speaking of the bird. When Dave ought to do is get together and redo your brick oven commercial. We gave it one. Do it the other, but make an emelting pot commercial. Hey, Neil, this is Dave. It's a melting pot. Yeah. Yeah. We have it. That sounds good. Well, if the melting pot wants to buy some advertising, that would be a good way to do it. Okay. Hey, you know what else? Sue, that girl's change. She's got this pot. Oh, my God. Why do you pour this in? You haven't even hired to be in this business. Excuse me for going on, but I just curious. Do you have any desire to do any of this? Why do you have any openings? Oh, boy, that was a terrible thing to say. I can't do you believe he asked me that question. I'm sorry, sir. Go ahead. Dave just said something awful on the radio. No, Neil, you've got a terrific program. I listen to you daily and got caught off. All right, today when I saw an economy and said, David mentioned my name over the year. And I'm kind of busy, so I won't tell you guys up. Neil, I'm trying to get you some. You do. Sure, so you're going to be out there. We'll stop in Dave. We'll make reservations today and see the both of you out there, I guess. Well, let me ask you this question. But I'm always curious about this. Like all these people came by last night. And it was great. I mean, I can't begin to tell you what a positive, because they were all nice. I mean, each person was nicer than the other one, which means the first one may not have been all that great. But by the time we got to the end, they were sensational. But seriously, what is the deal? Because I know there's one host, Mr. Ego, and Tano's used to come watch a seat, come watch a seat. Which I don't, I can't think of very many people. I would love to go watch eat dinner, sit around and watch the meat. What does that mean? The drawers you, the drawers you, Kyle, the burrary. A Kyle's not going to be there. Okay, but not just that in general. You guys, I hear you in the radio. And the birds definitely not going to be there under penalty of death. They have a do a show from the floor. Yeah. Dave, Dave should be in your chair today. And you should be down the floor. You do a great job. Oh, listen. We can get in a lot of trouble with that scenario. I can just see that now. Okay, here we go. We can get in the room. Yeah. The style here about the radio. The features, the oversized heavy set man. The drawer is the easy going talk on the radio. Yeah. The way things happen. It's a gay right. So the, by sexual whatever. Whatever. You know, be whatever you are exactly. Just the drawers and the floor. And we're trying to find out what Dave is. But he won't tell us. So Graham, and then go right into the mung brain over there. Right. But this guy is really just rambling along. And you're your excellence. You're really, uh, out of sight. But he has a shaken. You're what? I can write here. I'm so much. Me too. I have to. Dave, he told me to take a little place. I got your, I'm not going to go. Any minute. Go on. I'm going to go on a go. And a half kiss. Okay, well listen, sir. I think you've really done yourself quite a number here. Okay, Neil. I'm going to swing by there and share in a billion new booth and Brad's. I can take too many to your time and get in the booth with you. I'm not. Well, we don't want all squeeze in there, you know, but we're going to be delighted to say hello and whatever else. Yeah. And Dave will see you all through too. Yeah, great. John, thanks for calling. Okay. See you, John. Take care. In other words, that's bogged by right. Get rid of them. Yeah. Okay, let's take one from Dave next. We do have one open line. I should give these numbers out. I never do when they all flanks like that. Because they just go nuts. And that's because you're here today. They just, uh, you don't believe that? What? That the lines are going nuts here. Can't you see them? They're all flanks. And we got seven lines. They're all? Of course. Is it bad? I don't know what I'll even. Buttons mean? Look at the phone. So can you see the lights flashing? Yeah, I see a lot of empty ones. No, those are business lines. These are the calling lines. What's the idea of open one? Yeah. Now, that's the bat line. That's the inside line. All of these are the talk lines. Seven. Seven. Count them. Are all seven in my line? Why is one not flashing? Because that's the one that we're going to put on the ear. Okay. Any more questions? That's it. Okay. I'm ready to take control. Do you want to sit down over here and I'll sit over there? No, you staying your spot. Why? It'll be a disaster. I mean, I have no idea what any of this is. But you come in here right away. Yeah, too, buttons there. You press them. Yeah, simple. Even a more on could do this, right? Okay. Hello. He has left the room. But hello. Oh. Yes. He, I need your clouds. The clouds that comes with your name. Okay. I need you. What do you do me a favor? I'll do anything for you. Well, thank you. Would you call Grinnell's park and find out what's going on over there? Why? There is lots of movies, the star movers, and cameras, and people. And I'm dying to know who's over there. And I called and they won't tell me. Maybe they're shooting advice over there. Oh, and I say, they had that last time. We don't want to see that. Maybe it's someone important. Maybe it's Jeff Striker. Oh, boy. Oh, couldn't you call him find out? Okay, I'll do that right now. Wait a minute. Wait. Yeah. This. Now that's not it. I think this. They shot vice there last year, and it wasn't as big as this. Ooh, don't wrinkle that up. No, oh, please. Oh, God. Okay, I'll call right now and find out. Okay. Thanks. Okay, this could be something really exciting. It could be un- Un- Be relatable. Okay, or on the other hand, it could be. Total waste of time. Let's find out. Are you excited about this? No, yeah. Yeah. You know, it looks like the excitable type. It looks very common. Layed back. This is nine, seven, six, Jeff. Just a moment, you went up to meet her at the caller. She'll be connected blind with the incredible Jeff striker. She's contacted Jeff. Coabers between two and 10 GM, Monday to Friday. All other kinds, meet her at the caller. She's number, or Jeff was near. Half five. Yeah. I love that voice. No, too. Yeah. He could be on the she. Like in the morning, maybe. When they have that big opening, so to speak. We're waiting. With baited breath. Are you getting nervous, sir? Are you going to sleep? What's going on here? We're waiting. Wait for something to happen on the phone day. Don't panic. Wait. I'm getting worried. Okay. On. Be a label. Okay, well listen, I think at that point we better interject. But that was pretty exciting. Yeah, like this. Did you like it? Yeah, it was interesting. What are you into voyeurism a little bit? I don't even know if that is. You don't want to know what that means. Another way to be like watching people do certain things. Sure. Sure. Yeah, that's going to be a stimulating, right? Right. Okay. Well, let's turn the lights out. And Kyle can watch. Only a joke. Okay, let's go back to the phone. Hello. Hello. Well, I'm speaking to you, please. You got him, sir. How you doing? How you doing, now? Real good. You have no idea. Yeah, I think there's a sheet. Please, a cat to be five out there. Is that it? Yeah, I believe that's what it is. Oh, boy. Another great movie to South Florida's credit boy. We get all the biggies. I hear that. I thought maybe it would be Porkies Nine. Really? Yeah. It's the cat's pick today. You got him. Yes, sir. Yeah, Dave's. Are you done? I think five got some real light. What are you talking about? We do. We do. Oh, there's Chrissy, of course. Oh, okay. And we got Lisa. Yeah. Well, no, I think that's right. I've got to be better to some of the women I saw down at the ice cream place. Oh, come on. Now, there were some really attractive people there last night. There were few, you know. I mean, not everybody can be fantastic. Not everybody can look like Michelle. Michelle was a guy. She was fine. She was fine. You bet. I'm in love with her. I was almost considering making the big switch. All right, well, you bet a lot for that now. Yeah, I know. I may get that operations. Well, I'll still listen to you. Okay, I'll give one. Okay. I'll get you later. There we go with the horny old man. Okay, let's take one from Dave County just because we love our friends and Dave. Hello. See what I mean? We love them, but they hate us. That's the way it's been all my life. Let's try another one, Carl. There's nobody there. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Dale. Yes, sir. How's it going? Okay, wake up, pal. Come on. Well, you know, the film has only been raining for like a 45 minutes. Well, that's okay. You kept y'all in trouble. Yes, sir. You had dude. But they hit you up problems with the bird. But they hit you bringing these young attractive guys on the... So, you know, he's getting a little, well... Yeah, he got, he couldn't handle it. I mean, Paul yesterday, he was nervous about, but when Dave came in today, he just crumbled. He couldn't handle this. Listen, does he got along here? The bird? Yeah. Minimal. Minimal here. Minimal? Yeah. Like he's got about as much hair as you'll Brenner did, but he rest in peace. Hot. Have you ever seen Telly Sivales, sir? Bird straight, right? We don't, uh, we have no idea. He flies a rather crooked path. So we don't, uh, we have no idea. It's bizarre. Uh, you know, you talk about... What, I mean, what difference does it make? In his case, especially. Well, a lot of different. We need like to know? No, not in the leaves, I know. No interest. No interest, sir. Did all? No. All right, so what else is going on? I hear Dave's on the line. Dave is here. What do you mean what else is going on? Well, I want to know what's happening. You don't call you every day. We're just, uh, you call us every day? Every day, I don't get through that. Oh, I see. It is at the phone ring, like, you know, 50, 60 times. Yeah. We're like, what's called a fool and rich life? Ha ha ha. Say what? A fool and rich life? Yeah. No, I know. You're just loyal and devoted, right? Fair. Yeah. Fair. And got it then went nobody else's life. I know. When we really needed you, you were there. Neil. Yeah. What do you think it is for boss training? I'm delighted. I'm so happy about it. You have no idea. But baseball, baseball, play officer coming up now. The twins have clenched. And the giants. It's going to be great because you've got Toronto and Minnesota and San Francisco. And the cartinals. You've got three out of the four teams. Our teams that usually are not in it. OK. Which is great. You know who's talking about baseball fan? Yeah, not. OK. So in other words, you're not going to be impressed by my deal. Murphy plaque that somebody brought over like, oh, I am impressed. Yeah. Yeah. It's impressed. You'd be impressed too if you look like the I'll Murphy. But go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. OK. You know, I don't mind it. As soon as I said that, he dropped the plaque. But I don't think it took his hands off and dropped it. Go ahead. Good. Your friend, Steve, Steve, did other station? Oh, Mr. Eagle? Yeah. What about him? More on. Oh, come on. Oh, my God. I mean, it may be true. But let's not, you know, not for us to say that. That's OK. He is embarrassing to self. I mean, I heard that he's doing something about, let's support the scabs or something. Yeah, let me tell you something. All right. He tells you that there's never a reason how much money they make and all this kind of stuff. It's not getting the personal license. Then he brings up Lori and the three quintelists. Oh, yeah. Then he goes on and on and on. And he called Lori the other day. They were talking about what did he call her? Yeah. Well, not as much as we did. But listen, what he did was he called it because he had a person on the show that was talking about being a show with a stick. Then he called his wife and says, if my wife is showing this thing, he says, yes, you are. And do you know the date wasted? And it was a waste. I mean, if it was a good call, but they wasted like 30 minutes of money every time. Yeah, like we're wasting all this stuff. I should have talking about it. We'd be different. You can pay me here, me talk. Oh, no. What if they pay me by the minute now? That sounds good. What he says. What? He came on and said that he's big five. I was talking about 200. Huh? He makes 200. Oh, he says, uh, he says, you know, I worked 45 years to make 200,000 dogs to get to 100. Well, now he's making two, sir, trust me. Oh, I don't give it to everybody. No, I didn't. For my party can make five because if he makes one or he makes five or 20,000, he still sucks. You know what I mean? I said no, sir. I have a one-hit list and I have a great day. I gotta take this break now or Kyle's gonna get real nervous. Hey, hey. One. Take a break. Okay. Right, I'll read the dirt. Great ghost. Providence, did he kind of will surely at the end of- Are you leaving? Now, where are you going? I'm here. Look like you were about to spring up and everybody's like leaving today. You know what I said? If I- did I use my right card? Did I? Not so. I mean, I left the house forever. I really, but um, did I do something wrong? Now, do I need to apologize? No? Have we offended you? Nope. Do I offend the bird? Yes. Yeah. Can you do that? Can we give a sign? Boy, Bob, lie, sit here. Hang your head and you shame. 10 minutes, put your clothes back. I'll let you place. 10 minutes before one. No, seriously. He's getting up to take his clothes off. This ought to be very exciting. I think we discovered something here today. Were you going to let me have one of those or not? I don't want to take your last cigarette. I don't smoke. And I don't want to encourage anybody to smoke. But I figured if I do everything that Dave does, we're going to week. I'll look just like he does. And then there'll be no more problems. I notice he's not- look at this. Oh. Oh my god, are you serial or what? Holy, Toledo, brick oven pizza is just brought in the whole store. What do you guys do? Posting up for a couple of weeks or one. Nine pies. Boy, boy, do we take care of your what Dave? Unbelievable. What probably if you take the what? You know, you don't have to be bashful in here. Just take over. You know, everybody else does. So just, you know, start waking in. No, drinks with this, sir. Come on, Dave wouldn't buy all the drinks you want. Relax, relax. Look at all this stuff. There's enough- What are we going to do? He's Army. Well, they all we want first. And then we'll let the rest of the people come in. Okay. Those are garlic slices. Those are fantastic. Believe me. Yeah. Never had one. Everything's marked. Okay, let's take a call while our guest is going through a- and a tank of gluttony. Thank you very much. That was beyond my wildest expectations. See, do we take care of your what? They don't want to be tipped. What do you think this is? The melting pot? Yeah. All right. Broward. Hello. Oh, move it. Are you doing now? Okay. Okay. I've got a phone number for you. If we got food here, boy, I wish we could share it with the audience. One, nine hundred, six, six, six, oh, hope. Jim and Tammy Bakers, new phone numbers. Oh, is that it? One, nine hundred. Six, six, oh, hope. Oh, I love that one. One. Two dollars is phone calls. Oh, we don't care. We got like this shows loaded. I know. I mean, money magazine, golf die, just reloaded on this show, you know. How's the pizza? We haven't touched it yet. What's this garlic slice when I found it? Pretty good. Oh, yeah. Those are great. There, it's like a pizza, but it's in slices. It's got garlic. Thank you so much. That was good. All right. I just want to let you know that phone number. That's all I've done. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Hi, how are you? Good day. I'll read the dirt. One, four, three, hike. Ha ha. Great. I feel like I'm back in college. You got him smoking. Here's this smoke, new ports. Three packs a day. Nice stick to cigars. Yeah, now I smoke. Cut cancer sticks. Big ones. Okay, let's take another call from Dave. What do you say? Sound good? Sound good. Sure. Hello. Hey, are you doing it? Good. What's up? Are you doing? Stop. What's up, dude? This is Dave. It's Paul. Oh, how you doing? I'm down to Miami. I'm running the melting pot down here. Wow. You got all your friends calling in, Dave. So, is this the one down in Kendall? This is the one down in Kendall, yes. And what I wanted to know, Neil, is you're making reservations. My manager called me and a lot of people are calling in. And I want to know how many people are going to be on your table. On my table or at my table. I feel explain, we have two different size tables. There will only be one person on the table. And he's sitting to my right, right at the moment. He'll be on the table. You'll be centered directly in the middle. I've recovered with chalk with fun, dude. Oh, you told them about that, huh, Dave? Yes. That's only for special customers. Only for me, trust me. I'd pay serious money. But anyway, uh, guys, we're trying to which I'm not going to lose. I have gold card, green card. I'm going to have an immigration green card. So anything you like. I heard about that. But, uh, I guess they're going to be four of us, because Stan and I and Sharon is bringing one of her elicit relatives or something. I don't know. So I guess four. Listered or elusive? Lusive. Lusive. A lucid relative. Yeah, elusive. Lusive. Okay. So there'll be four of you total. And one person centered in the middle. Yeah. We got it now. You think you can hold it down? I need to clarify that. How many guys does it take to hold him down? Although I guess we can find that out during CBS News. Says to Jeff. Just a joke. It's just a joke. No, I'm serious. Do you know how long have you known Dave? Well, I've known Dave actually. Money's Paul on the owner of the melting pond. Yeah, we know. Cool. Dave, um, Dave started building with it. He started what? Started us to do. Yeah, that's what he told me, yeah. Yeah, he started. We walked in one day and I go, boy. But I mean, you said, oh, boy? He didn't look so good. He didn't. He had a job. Well, what happened to him all of the same? Looks pretty good now. He became a master's stain technician. It's what it was. Well, we don't want to listen. I mean, it's a family show. Oh, no, stain technician. He stained all the wood. Oh, I see. Well, even then, I'm not so sure we can talk about it. Could be actionable. You know what I mean? I understand. I understand. And Dave's been with us about a year now. You're in a half, I guess. But I mean, he's he always had this like kind of disposition. Because I have a very bizarre for people to be just so like, nothing seems to phase him. He's very the thargic, yes. No, I didn't say, let's hard. Come on, Paul. See, you're just using that as an excuse to underpay him. I think you owe him a big raise. Personally. I mean, it's not what off my back now. It's very kickback. Yeah, but he's good. He's got a real good person out of God. Yeah, I does. He gets a lottery quit. How to personally just like to fold up, put in your trunk and take home for a few days. You know, and just sit there and laugh, you know. Am I right? Exactly. You see, I've got to pay perfectly. He's just a Mr. Good time Charlie, you know. Yeah. That's Dave. That's something about that's correct. Yeah, see, I'm a very good judge of character. And what's on the outside? Doesn't always tell you what's on the inside, right? Correct, too. Yeah, some people put on a facade. That's right. And we know what this is the real thing. Right. No, that's the real. You got the real day right there. Absolutely. What you see is what you get. And the cigarette is right hand, right? Yes, he does right now as we speak. Good. I won't tell you what he's got in his left hand, but it's a family show Paul. I understand. So listen, this better, I'm sure this is going to be great, because we've had a very reviews and everybody has said it's sensational and I get another hostile letter from the people at P. August because, you know, I mean, I would have gotten up there eventually, but it's just, you know, life is there. If I were to get you, would have hired some Foxy help up there. I would work, I'd go up there immediately, you know. I understand. If these people would just find out where my team might change your mind about me, after you see Paul that, I don't know. Really? Yes. Why is that? Is it good looking man? How old is he? He's your boss. This is about 25, 25, say? Really? Yeah. Right. 25 years old, I'm a hard work. I'm dedicated to find you. And you're the boss? On the boss, man. It's a young company. It's a young company. What does he do to see, like, force you to do a lot of tacky things up there? Or what? I mean, that you can talk about? Basically, you run a real relaxed group, right? Well, that's a way out of it. Yeah, you really do. I can't, I can't get over it. Maybe that's probably why the bird left the room because you couldn't have to cope, you know, with all this goings on here with somebody who is so us at home, it just seems to fit in here like a glove. So to speak. Fits in everywhere, you know. I don't think he's ever been put in a situation he feels uncomfortable, have you, Dave? Yeah, his matter of fact last night. Why what happened? Anything we can talk about? Now, really? Oh, you may have the ice cream place. I don't know what time you got off work. I was down on my ass. Did you go to the ice cream place? No, I couldn't get what they were talking about. I don't know. I guess it's something we'll have to discuss during the news break, right? Yep. Okay. All right, then, guys. You guys doing a great job. Thank you. What? But promoting the fondue? Yeah, you bet, man. I'm telling you what, they get better be great because, you know. Oh, it is. I'm not even, I'm not even worried about that. As long as you got Dave is away, then nothing can go wrong. Well, that sounds good to me. Okay, Paul. Well, listen, you're going to be there, right? Oh, yeah, I'll be there. Oh, boy. I'm always there Friday, sir. Well, maybe you can hold him down on the table for us. Well, we have special plans that are there. Okay. See you Friday. Take care. Bye. Bye. Okay, well, listen, we're going to eat now and you tell me a couple of little stories. Now, when we come back, we'll take some more calls and we're just, uh, you know, we're all, you're hungry and people in the building came from. Right away from Zader, from the other way to the building. Okay. Well, listen, they have good reason to be hungry, but that's another story. Now, just kidding, Peter. Just a joke. No problem. But we again want to thank Ray because he's feeding the starving here. He's just doing a fantastic job and in your wildest dreams when you came here, did you ever believe that you just mountains of food would be seen to that in front of you that you would be treated like a king or close to it. Okay, let's take some more calls here because the folks seem to be just foaming at the mouth. Don't they? The callers? Okay, probably the callers are for Dave and not for me anymore. Because they forget, you know? Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, that's me. Yes, sir. Hi, how you doing? Let me. Hi, how you doing? Oh, pretty good. Okay, let's just, right. We could do that one day. We could do the time tunnel. I'll just talk to myself or interview myself a lot better than most of the more rides at Gauri. Okay, let's try another one. Hello. Is this going to be going to hold our? I don't know. Hello. I don't think they've wanted to talk to you. All right, one more. And then that's it. That will just go to music. We'll change the format. Go to music. Hello. Hello, Neil. Oh, boy. You saved the show, sir. I bet that's a story of my life. You must listen to me very closely. I don't have much time to listen. Okay, I'm listening very closely. You know, Jamie and Marcy. Yeah. I didn't last night. They were there last night. My brother, if you knew I was listening, I'd be in grave danger. Why? Well, all over the country, Neil, and this has been going on for several years. He doesn't know I'm calling. They were unsuspecting talk show host to their home. For dinner. And they're never heard or seen from again. And said, Neil, it's been said that they forced these in the large kosher bill pickled until they're bustling into gut. And it's sad. It's scary. I don't know what to do. I'd be believable. Yeah. I had to warn you. I had to let you know. I'll take your last. You may have to save a couple of desperate tacos here. You do realize that don't you? They took your picture last night. And I saw it. But we're over at our parents house. He didn't dinner. I just want to straighten you out of one thing though. There were no people at the store last night with giant pickles. They keep them in the house. Trust me. Dr. Pile. Public is all out of him. Go to public. Go to Albert and see if you can get some giant large kosher bill pickled. Yeah. I found some large of bill pickles at Windixie. I don't want to touch that. Okay. Please. I have a question for you though. This is a serious question. Okay. Let's clean it up here a little bit. Yes. I'll be on the list and line in Portland. You know, they give you a good fight. I was talking to Stan a few weeks ago. And it went pretty well. But at the end, I mentioned the radio stage, which I'm not going to do. Another radio station in Chicago. And I wanted to tell a joke, which I had heard of there. And I guess I... Which one, WLS? No. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. No, I won. Why would I cut you off, imagine you've got station in Chicago? Okay. Well, I'll do it in your company. It was a loop. So what's wrong with a loop? I don't know. But I was going to mention a joke. I heard of it. I should have kind of offered it. I can't do it. Go ahead. Well, it's a bad weather joke. It's terrible. You know, it's a thing. Well, what are you doing when it's raining cats and dogs? You know, it don't step on a puddle. But I mean, it would be like the ultimate bad joke at the end of a pretty... I'm talking to that Chicago radio man. It's so good. And it puts that dams thinking Howard Stern to shame. You know what I'm saying? Oh, I'm an airline pilot. So when I'm up there, I listen to it. Well, it figures. You know, what do we're having all these problems? You know what I'm saying? I don't want to do that. It's the right runway. Yeah, it's pretty bad. It's scary actually. Yeah. But like that flight, I took the Pittsburgh. When you landed at all here, I got a little nervous. You know what I mean? I tried me with air. You were on air? Yeah. Oh, but really, I don't work for that. What do you think about that? That's just when I'm down here with a gate C8 down there. It's my own airport where it's... I don't get involved in all these controversial issues. We keep this show very late back. I have no opinions about anything, sir. That's cool. I've got 180 degree chair. I used to be an opinionated son of a bitch. I just have no opinions about anything. I respect that. I respect that. But listen. I don't read the newspaper. I don't watch the news. I want to be left alone. You know what I mean? I had to warn you. I had to warn you. I know Marcy isn't this beautiful. You look like a normal person. She looks normal. She's good looking. Wait a minute. Well, sir. Let me give a little music here. We have our management team in here. Thank you, sir. All right. And where is this run? The beautiful birthday cake. Public. I'm your likes from Peelbix, sir. Thank you so much. You touched my heart. And other body parts. What is it? Is it going to fall? No. No. I hate listening. It's under control. Trust me. Thank you very much. On my one-year anniversary, it says don't buy a house. A little print. Isn't that beautiful? I like it. You didn't realize when you came here today, what are you? Special day. I guess. For me, I just don't leave day. But I got a great idea. Okay, let's take a vote in the building. You know how they like pass out secret ballots. And nobody, they're not marked. Nobody will know who's, you know, like the X. We'll take a little poll. And we'll see. Maybe we can get you a new job. Be great. Okay. I mean, you know, one that really pays. And we can have the bird. Can you just see him at the melting pot, waiting tables? He's kind of floating from one table to another. And you can be here every day. Sounds good. Does that sound good? Sounds good. All right. Shall we hand the secret ballots now? Let's put Gina in charge of the secret ballots. You know, like take a bunch of slips of paper. Can you do that? Is it sometime the next 10 minutes? So, I'm serious about this. Well, they got to do just on each sheet of paper, like make Dave or the bird. And like a check place to check. Seriously, she's laughing. This is a very serious moment on this program. It's our one year anniversary. This could be the turning point. We do pretend. Yeah. Or do perhaps for little change. It'd be shaky him out of his bad mood. And they're in the other room. He seems to be just absolutely. A little too much of that too heavy on a heart's mountain this morning. I think man, he went nuts on that one brand of bird. See, he was going crazy. He's pouting. Well, let's give reasons to do it. You know, I don't know. I don't know that he's got any reason to do it yet. But let's, you know, get about 50 little slips of paper and hand it. Or maybe 100. I don't know. We got so many people to work here or go out into parking lot. There might be a few. And then you can round them all up. They can all be anonymous. And we'll tell him up. Okay. Obviously, it doesn't want to be here. Absolutely. It's right. A quick. So we have nine pies and one great big cake. Boy, I thought you'd know more food on this show. Did I tell you that? Okay. Are you going to, uh, we'll have to cut that cake. How are we going to do that? Rich will supervise that. Okay. I knew you would. Okay. Let's take another call from Dave County while we're cutting up the big cake and having our major celebration. Hello. Yeah. See? Yep. They love me. Okay. Wouldn't hang on. Let's try another one. Dave County. Hello. Yes. This is. How are you doing? Is it Neil? Yeah. Yeah. Neil. I want to ask you a question. I need to find out if you have an extra. Tape of a. Um. Um. You know that month or man that you have. Oh, yeah. So I have an extra tape of it. Yes. No, but I could put it on tape for you. Send me a cassette. Okay. What's the address that? W. I. N. Z. Mm-hm. My. My. Ami. Three. Three. Oh. Five. Five. Five. Five. Very good. He's already practicing. He's becoming, you know, like a part of the act. That's right. Okay. So anyway. Okay. I appreciate. Is that it? That's it. Good luck to you, sir. Okay. Thank you. You bet. Hey, listen. Anything for this audience. They're great. They're wonderful. They turned out any enormous numbers last night through rain and sleep and snow and nothing stops them. Hello. Bubble. Bubble. That's it. Take me. Yeah. Oh, that's Stan. I'm telling you, you got a sense of humor. What? They counted. Hello. The elf? Yeah. How are you, Stan? Great. Welcome to WI and Z. Sir. Yes. I came up last night to see if the ice cream store and it was a pleasure seeing you and there were a lot of very nice people there. It was a manhouse. Right. I wanted to have a chance to give you a few of my observations from up there at the ice cream store. Sure. Our first of all, you were much better looking guys than I had expected. Really? That's about yourself. Is that true, David? Yes, it is. Yeah, he's saying that because he's eating all the food. And I picked you up as being kind of overweight. You didn't bat in the ugly, yeah. And look, particularly, have you? You were sitting down so I couldn't really see you. Yeah, well, I was inhaling the whole time. You've lost some weight, haven't you? No. So I heard. And the bird, he was at a total disappointment. Really? Yeah. Right. Let's attack him now. You know, unmercifully. Let's really let him have it. I just heard that he was very quiet. He was very surprised. He was so bizarre as to be indescribable. I don't know what his story is today. What his problem is. He just came in here. He started, in fact, he got Paul to hang up. He was here yesterday. He was badmouthing him. They came through and taken it back because you and Stan were getting all the attention. Well, we weren't anywhere near him. I don't know how you could say that because we were like in three different groups. He was inside the store. And he was, you know, out of graphing all of my pictures, which was kind of bizarre. And seriously, and then Stan was in one area with all of his been. I was way in the back, luckily, because I had to find somewhere to sit down, because otherwise, everybody was hovering. And we were like in three different groups. It was hard to see you because you were totally surrounded. And it was hard to see Stan because there were a lot of people around him. But Glenn was just sitting out there and nobody was like, and you could tell why after speaking. I always thought he was such a mild manner to easy going, you know, reasonable bird, you know? He was part of a nerd as well as a little bit. Well, it rhymes. It's a man as a concern. He was very nice, very fresh, but I'm good to tell you. He does have a problem with women. He cries that he's a guy who's looking for women as much as he says. He is, there was a young lady there who came up with Stan to get his autograph. And she was absolutely magnificent in every way. Yes. And really, he seemed to acknowledge her, I don't know if he was in a day or he just was. Well, he was probably doing his Brian fixation routine, you know. But a cloth, I say you and I hope you do it again. So thank you. Okay, welcome to Rip the Bird on WINC. It's a new feature we're going to be doing daily from 10 to 2. And don't stop now. I mean, you're just in the middle of an eating friend. It's great. Are you enjoying it? I've had two pies, but are you enjoying it, though, Dave? It is unbelievable. Really? Yes. It's a good time for the great taste. Okay, we'll take a break on that note and get a little peptal, Bismal, little died, Jell. And, you know, we'll see if we can't get you ready for the second course. Okay. Who still is not back in here? Why do keep it up, Dave? So the audience is probably hanging on the edge of their seats, wondering if he's going to come back in here. Ah, wait, I need him, right? Do you think there's any chance? No chance. He's went for in back there. Okay, let's go to Brower, hello. Browering. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Buenas deez. Happy anniversary, Neil. Thank you so much. Are you talking to me? I sure am. You were right about one thing. You know, it's at a bird. Looks just like tweet, man. You hit that nail right on the head. Were you there last night? That was, that's it. Okay. Well, I wouldn't lie to you. It was very nice. It was a nice turnout. It was nice people. Yeah, it was such a fun experience. And then, of course, you come back in here today. And it's life is usual, you know? What is this problem? We, the listener's demand and explanation. Why is he on strike? Well, he's on strike because he's pouting because he's been upstage the last two day. Now, how could he be upstage yesterday? I don't know because Paul was a very nice guy, but he didn't. He didn't. Wasn't overbearing. Didn't have an awful lot to say. Dave, of course, is overwhelmed him because Dave is like a living and breathing human who has a lot, you know, not a lot to say. But it's, uh, what I don't understand is, uh, when he came into small and the first thing he said he is, aren't you going to apologize the yesterday show? Yeah, that was it. I don't understand that. I don't have any idea. And then, of course, Paul did call it and he blew him away in no time. And I said, here with a phone dangling and I don't know what you've got to understand. The big problem that happened when I went in vacation. Since that moment, the bird has become like bigger than life. If you're part of that expression, there are some movies called that. But he's because just overwhelmed with his popularity now. And I guess he's probably going to start his own station and, uh, I think he can handle it. In fact, we saw him yesterday afternoon when he was preparing to go to the Eskimo Street, who's out of the back building a huge nest back there, running at tower number two. So I think he's probably going to start his own station back. That's what he's doing. He's building an F.N. Tower 3. Yeah. A couple of quick questions for you, Neil. The Tower of Power. I watched Larry King last night. Well, listen, life is not perfect, sir. He says that one fourth, re-high. What does that supposed to mean? Well, you know, there are no football games. He wants to make America feel like they still have a little touch, you know, with the NFL. No, that's his big signal to Angie. Is that what that is? One, four, three, or which is the most, the tackiest thing in the world. First of all, the idea that Angie would do anything with any part of Larry King's body. You're so disgusting to begin with. No one would like to imagine. We Larry King could be the ugliest person in the history of the human race. Okay, and Angie, even at her age, is still pretty well built. Very well built. Yeah, you can say that again. Now, if I talk about built, I was the guy who was standing there last night. When you were signing out, woman's t-shirt. Oh, yeah, writing on her boob, yeah. Quite interesting. Yeah. The other question I wanted to ask you, that's, uh... That's all I get. See, the story of my life. Nobody came along and said, you know, can you sign, you know, any were else. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly what you said last night. Yeah. I liked it. I was like, I stand in above you. When you first sat down, I said, okay, Neil, now you can talk to Matt. Oh, yeah. I be honest with you. I was in a fog. I feel... I feel crowed around you, but I tell you Neil first. And then when a woman kept pressing her crotch against my knee, that... Put it around. The heavy woman. No, no, there was a heavy... Oh, yeah. And I thought, oh my god, what is your name, so I can write this in please. I mean, this is not what I had in mind, you know. Yeah. Yeah, really. You'll have a question I wanted to ask you. Is that really Frankie Valley or not, uh, Joey Pinto? Yeah. Turn it off America. Turn it off at the front office. Give Harry a hernia. Yes, it is. Let me tell you a little story about all those things. Joey, I'm sure he's still playing a lot of that crap. Years ago, like way back before the invented the wheel, they used to have a service for this jockey's where groups would record customized show opens, you know, like the charles and... Like that one. The four seasons in Frankie Valley. And all of the stuff that they had, or at least most of the stuff that they had at WKVW and Buffalo was stuff like this that was custom-made for the station. All right. And for their jobs. Right. And that's what that was. It's not like, you know, Frankie Valley came into all my good friend. Like, you know, that thing he plays by Wolfman Jack. I mean, let's get serious. That up. It's like, it's a promo type of deal. It's not really anything legit. I mean, like, Franky Valley really wasn't his friend. Like he said, well, maybe he was his friend. I don't know. But it was just in conjunction with the station bay. What they say, birds of a feather swam together. And that bird really does look like a bird. Yeah. Oh, well, we're not missing them. You're a friend there, Paul. Dave. Dave. Dave. Dave. Is Dave entertaining you today? He's doing a good job. Yeah, he's fine. He's eating up a storm. He's smiling. He's pleasant. He's not making any cost to comment about our other guests. They can illustrate jokes. Is he at the curb joke? Yeah. And the not so straight jokes. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye bye. We're getting ready for reviews already. Right. Okay. Let's take a call from Dave County again, because I know that somebody in Dave loves it. Oh, you got the score sheet? Oh, in other words, you just had a, okay. Gina has gone around the building. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a an incredible moment. Do we have a drum roll? No, we got something better than that, because we had that young lady who called the Canadian. Yeah. Okay. We can never get Joey Reynolds to stop playing on the car machine. We may have a new national bird of Canada in just a moment ladies and gentlemen. I can see so much. This staff. We may have to call in some outside help. You know what I mean? Like my friend, my pie's on over the beach. I have to get him some new help in here. Popular opinion. There are 16 nerds. Okay. In the building. 50. Let's see. 510. 13. What? Well, I didn't vote. 2 are undecided. Jay Michaels voted for himself. There's a little asterisk here. It says this survey's based on the 16 people who are in the building right now. Gene Cashman, of course, is a great programming expert beyond a shadow of a dial. One of our brilliant programming experts. Her expertise probably is unlimited in the broadcasting. Thought that they wasn't exciting enough needs to talk more. Let me see that. There you go. Can you believe that? So shut out. However, we did put it in a call to another brilliant programming expert Rick Sclarer in New York. We put it in a long distance call and he voted for Dave. We put it in a called a built-in or he also voted for Dave. I'm speechless. Wait a minute, but you're not hearing the rest of these things. You're not a panor-voted for you. Bill Tanahadina. Rick Sclarer voted for you. How do you know? Sunny Fox voted for you. You know who else voted for you? It's a good time. There you go. Donald voted for you. So you see the votes are coming in from the real broadcasting people. Well, I think we need the audience as a opinion at the end of the story. Exactly. Good thinking. Well, what a great way to kill the last half hour. Exactly. This guy, listen, I'm telling you, you could be dangerous. You can't be dangerous. I'm just sure. I'll still be sitting here too, but that's another story. Okay, let's go on. What we're going to do in this last half hour. And if you're calling for other reasons, don't run away, but we might just ask in passing. Right? Right. In passing? What they, what a little poll. What you say what? They'd count. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Two things. Number one is, did you know that bird, the two and a half times, around body weight? Yeah, I've seen it. I watched it with my own eyes day after day. Okay. And the other things that heard the caller before about the day bowling league? Yeah. I was on the gay bowling league. Really? I wasn't trying to. And it pulled me. It was us. And there were also a group of backtits that... That... That? Yeah. No, that. Okay, I'm sorry. That took over the phone. Wait, what is it that you're looking for, Gina? That took over the phone, pulling you out. Is there any pizza left? Well, there's a pizza right there. Or no, it's in any pasta. And I ran into my sister. Hey, listen, don't be choosy, Gina. So the price is right. Go ahead, sir. I ran into my little sister. Really? At the bowling alley. Yeah. Panging out there. They've said he would like to run into your little sister. But, uh, uh, um, she said, what are you doing here? I said I'm bowling on a lead. You said, oh no, Ray. Please don't. Tell me. You become a captain? Yeah. You're a captain? Oh, I think he bowling. That's pretty good. Wait, you have a good day. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Do you want to cast your vote? I like it. Thank you. Okay, I hope for that. Thank you. Okay, wait a minute. We have a special call coming in ladies and gentlemen. We have a special call. Are you going to put it on now? Okay. Here's our mystery caller. Hello. Yes. Just one. To let you know that, uh, you know, I'm here. If. Yes. But I'm kind of busy signing autographs right now. For the rest of the staff, no doubt. How about both come out in the building? Well, we don't want to talk to you. We've discovered that we need to survey the outside of the building. What's your vote, sir? How. You say once, sir. Don't let you know that, uh, you know, if, if, if, if, if, if, if, you know, sort of a contingency plan for you, you know, that's all. Okay, sir. Goodbye. Thank you. Okay. Let's continue the more scientific survey. Now, let's, uh, because the phone survey certainly, I'll do the, uh, and the end of the, uh, uh, Broward. Hello. More, it's not first time for all of us.

I heard that song and I automatically thought I'd go ahead. I heard that on a show in town the other morning. I want to say which one. Well we have that tip too. No we don't have that one. We have Larry Bird and here's somewhere I was just looking for it but yeah I got that in the other one but I wouldn't waste the cart. Very keen program for a play that I guess. Yeah. So you last night had a good time. I enjoyed the I got a picture of the girl with the t-shirt you're signing out. Really? That was fun. Yeah she had everybody writing all over her chest was pretty pretty exciting for some. And it won't work where people sign and they could have gotten them weren't just in place.

It's life and death. Life and death. Well my my position does this is that you're happy I'm happy. Well the vote is for Dave then I guess. That is that not commitment or not. Hey listen I want to tell you something I mean you know it is coming every day and have somebody sitting here who is smiling and a good mood and also on a scale of one is about an 800 you know I mean that's not bad just doesn't hurt to look you know. I heard you mentioned for Donia earlier I went to school there. For Donia? I sure did it wasn't the duck soup for Donia either. Wow while there's a big hit movie in Buffalo and I'll call Francis does Fredonia which is coming out next Monday it's going to be fantastic. Pretty wild. Yeah. I got a couple of questions here for you. Yes. What's the deal with Kyle is he leaving you? He's just moving into the mornings and so on my right or did we have another change yet are you still moving in the morning? Okay next next week next week. Is that going to Toledo or is he not going to Toledo or is he not going to Toledo or he may have relatives working in Toledo but that's another story. Did you have a meeting with the higher up as far as you're sadder than you think? Well we have some interesting things. Let's just put it this way. We have some interesting things that may be developing okay? There are one can get no I'm not going to but one can get really well good like to you sir. Also I'm the fellow that arranged you to get those mojo nixon records. Gray where am I see these blinds. I was going to ask you if they showed up because I checked with the records up you get today you said you said you said well we didn't get them. Of course we have somebody who intercepts a lot of the mail and I want to mention a names. Okay. I'll read fluents to pull but okay. If you're interested I'm going to give a call. I know the folks over right old records that you're interested by getting you some kosher club and you know people things to give away. Oh I would love to have those. I mean those would go like like potato pancakes. And I know those guys over there saw see what I can do for it and also mojo nixon is going to be doing a bit of a public relationship type tour and if you're interested or a stand is interested I think we can arrange to have them on the show. I think it's going to be a town October 8th. Great. The Wednesday and the coincidentally it's the first day of suckers. Well if Stan ever comes in here we can find out what the story is. Would you be interested? He may also be bought now we don't have too many get very limited number of guests on this show. Like today yesterday. Like today. Yeah okay. All right well maybe I'll ask Stan Lee T if he's interested in it. Okay. All right now see what I can do for you on the other stuff and one other thing I I've met on agony a bunch of times but he used to be a whaxy. Yes. Is a waste of proto pleasant. He is a great argument for birth control. He is. I think sterilization is a worthy we're looking for. Well you know if you can work out a retroactive abortion he's a good candidate for it. Okay. See you bye. Adios. Okay the poll is just devastating so far in one direction. Date County hello. What box I vote for the bird? Oh okay well you hear the nature of his colors don't you the people who want him? Oh boy. Exactly. Some foul colors on this show today. Let's take another one from Broward. Hello. Yeah sir. Let me let me show my Please. Please. Try to control yourself. Okay I'm back. Great. You're still taking this poll. We're doing whatever the hell you want sir. It's very show it's a great day and the... Well that I Dave sounds like a super guy. Sounds nice but I mean you know we out here listening audience cannot see what he looks like and listening to him is about as exciting as watching concrete hard. So I mean well I got news for you there maybe something else that would harden if you know but that's another story. But we can't we can't see him I mean he said trust me. He sounds like a nice guy. He is he's a great guy. Well I mean I don't know. When he comes here he will never be seen again. I'm what a good bird. Do that I do better than me. Well the bird you don't you don't like jumping enough but you just kind of sit there and wait for me on a kick in the butt and then you say something. I haven't kicked him in the butt once you answer. Well I mean you just sit I mean it's your big day. I'm not into discipline okay. Okay well I'm trying to say it. I just do a fine job. Yeah that's it. And if you think you can do a better job here. Well you just I mean it's your big day. You gotta just jump in there and take charge. I mean he'll be a lot better tomorrow. Okay I mean you know. Are you coming back tomorrow? Yeah I guess it's just I mean. We should all but just as kind of a how do I describe it gently. In other words like a little message you know what I'm saying? I'm gonna be. Yeah. What is saying? Well when somebody gets a little bit personipity and that's a nice word because it's like kind of neuter like the bird. When somebody gets a little bit too big for their bridges then you have to kind of intimidate them a little bit right? Yeah. Now don't you think that if Dave shows up again tomorrow and of course tomorrow he'll be a little loser to probably have a lot more to say that that would be uh represent a threat. I guess basically you're doing a good job. Yeah say you can't. That's a first day. I mean you gotta remember he just walked in here out of the cold and he's at least sounded lucid. He hasn't had a lot to say yet because he's just getting the feel of things so to speak. Well this isn't the best phone call it. Color I throw it either. Yeah. Tell me what do you want me to do? Let me talk about Gabriel. Not at all. Yeah do it. You do best. Okay. All right. Well he already voted for the bird so you know. Okay. We're gonna go next. Probably the date county because that's where they really know what's happening. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Yeah. Yes. It's here's the end-mind anniversary and uh uh and Dave soon. I was wondering uh you know the phone number. Is your anniversary and Dave's? I mean well I hope you guys have a wonderful life for you right now. We would have had a little cake, little something special for Dave. Yeah. What I meant was all three of us is the anniversary you Dave and I. What does that mean? Okay. It's our one-day anniversary together. You've been on the air for a year. Dave's one. Well I have been on the air for a year. I've been on a year for a lifetime. I mean one year in this uh day. Yeah. And uh it's been Dave's first year working at the Nalting Puy. Yeah. And that's my girlfriend's in my anniversary. Wow. All right. Look at your latest sky. A little uh come on. I like to join you but uh I don't want to tell you. That phone number to the Nalting Puy. You'd like to what? We can't find the phone number to the Nalting Puy. You know how to dial a full one one? Full spring. Give him the number. Come on. That one five five. How many? How many? Six three six eight. What is it? That's in cool springs. What is number? What is your road? What's about Miami? Did you get the number? You don't want the Miami one. We're going to be at the cool springs one. All right. Okay. But maybe he wants to take his girlfriend to the one down there. I don't know the number. The Miami one. I think that's a console. Yeah. Sunset. We're used to live. We're the bird lives down there. Yeah. God forbid. And Dave says it's great. Yeah. Did you cast a voter that I miss it? You didn't cast it. You didn't cast a vote yet. Yeah. But is the fun number to the one of the Miami? Well, we don't know but are you going to cast a voter? You're just going to keep like this is 20 questions. Uh I don't know. Undecided. Yeah. Okay. Good call. Good loss. Okay. Can these people dial information? Is it that difficult? Yeah. I don't know. Like we have all the numbers in our fingertips. Boy, you look really wide awake in bushy tales when you do this crawl out of the sack. Oh. I'm still ripped from last night. It was quite an experience. It was not. It was gut wrenching. We have decided now. I don't know how long you've been listening. As you look like you slept in late, which I also did by the way, didn't get up to like eight thirty this morning. Really did it. Really? Yeah. But now our guests celebrity here today has worked out very well. Got cheese fondue off there by the way. And now no. You still have some Friday, though. Okay. Good. You will? You will? Well, he's going to be there too. You don't know. Don't start looking down at him or you're being big trouble. I'll mount it right up for you. He gets you will. Yeah. Chocolate fondue. You mentioned something about that. Yeah. He's going to light down a little bit of the table. Start naked and they're going to cover him with chocolate. Isn't that what you said? Um that's what I said. Yeah. Well, somebody said that. Have a brunette which was a little bit of a crazy, fun. He's obsessed with crazy. I mean, I don't know. That's right. Yeah. But he's not obsessed with you. I think you would like her stand. She's going to be there for any. Yeah. She will. He's not obsessed with you. Did she have a boyfriend? Yes. She does. Oh, I see. And he's like, oh, I got to use it. I've all got a boyfriend. Yeah. But last night, that perfect proof of that. She does up. That one. She didn't get to see you last night. Even Dave said he's going to boyfriend. Just a joke. It's just a joke. Believe me. Guys, just the housing on all those young ladies out there at the emelting pot in his mind. And his mind. Okay. We got now listen. We got a couple of minutes left and this is the pivotal moment. And you missed it. And did you see Mr. Bird anywhere in the building or is he still pounding? He's just talking to him. Is he talking? Boy, I know we were talking about somehow. We were talking about last night. He is a wreck. Is he an absolute wreck? He will got up and walked out of here like the most ejected foul in the history of mankind. I've never seen anything like after all that good food people brought last night. Yeah. And you should have seen him out of food that showed up here from brick oven. He is just, I can't believe that he would pass that up. So he must really be in a foul mood. Okay. Let's take these pivotal last calls. Rowered. Hello. I'm going to hang up now. What do you mean? You're going to hang up now? How does that supposed to be? Good. I'm going to hang up now.
