and uh what else was I obsessed with Donald with that thing for a little but you know life goes on it's a moving evolving process but what's Stan he becomes obsessed and he's obsessed for life oh that was done did you notice that did you hear it I don't care because his hair off at the neck you know what I'm saying I mean who cares already and if he is listening what difference does it matter why is he so obsessed with you for star what is that stupid thing so he really is he's like a almost shook up I'm shook up from that I take a little to give him shook up yeah and now he's got a committee's going to be upset with me they're going to say we're ranging a magenta which we're not now we're just trying to cure him of this obsession oh wait did you hear this one of these a little

keep threatening to take don't say they're master are I watched stand by me on HBO Saturday night you have refused to let the bird give an objective movie review oh I refused to be I've a how many chances have I given you over the last 16 weeks even though we both know he's not a bird but rather one of the leeches under her Phoenix's body I thoroughly enjoyed the flight but they stole most of your material I heard the words douchebag and larnaz and even heard the song by Benny King called stand by me is the credits roll if I were you I would be hotter than one of those roasted marshmallows they were attempting around the campfire I take the movie and replay the leech scene river Phoenix has an acorn for a palace but will weaton has a semi truck what kind of a stick letter is this I know this because I pressed the pause button during that scene my VCR would not respond not freeze the DVDs on the VCR and the leech pulled out enough blood for a three hour godfather scene I now have nightmares about runaway trains over cooked marshmallows and bullies all thanks to you in the bird I trust most of your listening audience saw the show I hope so it is a four star and a star is a day for a four star movie star mr. bird is right on target for a change his purpose has been validated keep him until Michael Jackson's next video or three months which ever come to play Mickey is the mouse that he is a duck what is goofy who be is anybody who doesn't like this movie period great and you know to give you an idea of where is this is coming from and it's from my fan of the real Rogers fund who told us it says river lives acorn and all yeah it's from one of those river Phoenix's group he's at so yeah this was the appropriate just rice thought that was okay 11 25 and w i and z

well I don't think I can say it's on the thing I like and sister will not take any more freebies there I can't handle that all right okay I insist okay although after last night and pompano yes that wasn't too bad though anyone's heard the track of this man I never cast somebody winning tickets nonetheless the balls in my left pocket got smaller and smaller and smaller what is that bulging your left oh the shirt pocket I said I meant your bulging your pants pocket yeah I noticed that kept getting smaller too but that I was another story look I picked eight million winners can I help it if

State he did oh yeah let's do a little sports here with a bird that could be a new feature on this show every day okay well keep Dave occupied because he's gonna say a lot of dirty things to the obviously uh oh you haven't seen Santa I go away to him and let me have Santa for just one second hey I we actually have new batteries for Santa to keep him busy Santa come on hey thank you I'll stand okay that's enough don't exert yourself Santa come on save it for Christmas or you'll uh thinking mung that I think so yeah okay anyway there's where we're gonna get lunch today you think we what is

given you great but we do need some lunch and here today because we have a superstar that came in you we are guest let's take a call from Miami hello oh the charagers yes sir are you today great listen we were wondering if maybe you'd play a little dialogue from moving from just striker now are you another one of those desperate queens sir oh no I haven't even seen the movie so we thought maybe we could dialogue before we see the movie you haven't seen the movie yet oh the dialogue is pretty hard to follow alright well I want you to listen carefully and see what you get out of this sir okay sir you say what how many springs do you give it I don't know I seem to be a green with someone a lot yeah yeah he likes to be a grayable yeah limited vocabulary I give it a force brings for spring oh how about a steam song or is it for player for spring hey you're going to play a thing we're going to be playing bigger than life a little later on we don't like to do it too much at once because you all get for you excited yeah you're right I'm sweating here are you really I believe it sounds like we can hear the your first operation dripping through the phone we hope it's first for a sensor yeah what if you look like actually I really haven't had a chance that you're already in a cold sweat and you don't even know what he looks like oh I I I I look he looks like a greasy kid with a you know gigantic smile he's not he's not as good as you talk about me no just right that's what I've heard that it's got like a big smile but I haven't heard you know I really know what we'll tell her here he has anything he's like he has black hair on his head and the other features we should drop down oh yeah I think which will you recommend by the way bigger than life trust me and leave a lasting impression on your body so with it yep bigger than life yep now what is what is it that you find so humorous about the bird is in a is it a love him asking you these questions and love who just right here though this guy asking you these go ahead and it's never even seen I and you just sort of well you talk about tiptoe around what's that where do you go see this I do the playing like you know you have to go to your nearest video star and I'm sure in date because in Broward you know all of these have been confiscated because Nick Navarro wants to make sure he sees all of them you know first hey hasn't gotten to the exact oh I'm sure he has but he wants to see him a second and third time just to make sure that he can determine our community standards you know one go to video storage staff for a big of a way they look at you funny no they would smile it probably break out laughing I'd be a bearer if they start making noises yeah for start if they start putting some of the dialogue from the movie I would run out of the crew immediately okay I don't know what bobwood probably not like it she probably like it a lot how old is your mom 35 oh yeah mom we're like what do you mean 35 how old are you 18 oh yeah child brides wow what do you mean by the skin of his teeth just barely old enough you need to see the movie oh that's okay all right it would leave the lasting impression believe me I don't you and your mom can watch it together well did it have female for it do they have female but it no okay he isn't new one though that's got everybody in the big switch the big swing like yeah the big switches on or some electrical big foot yeah well good luck to you so you're this call is you know our transmitter is starting to try to what self-destruct but good luck okay well thanks a lot okay good luck to your mom too sounds like you got a pretty cozy relationship there doesn't it just a curious girl yeah 18 year old guy 35 year old mom they're watching portal flicks together and the vcr and they are privacy of their den you know for the 80s are really something they really are and of course used to be our demographic the 80s that's cemetery village hi I'm doing over this go here that's still that's true yeah where's the show each I don't think we haven't picked you out in the show I'm sure this is very nice but Jill is so great yeah and Jill's a little young for you Dave you're a 15 that's okay who's that a guy with sir brother so I love that so that meaningless it says on the back of the picture and by the way the pictures of rob from windyxie uh some people just don't photograph well that's all of those are horrible pictures I must say because he is a very sensational how do I say this without getting upset he won't get upset he wrote me a nice little note isn't he in school right now I hope so he has batteries playing hookie he and Jill are doing horrendous thing uh safely though they're doing unsafely which is all accounts so Dave is going to tell us about his life a little later on in the show which I'll take a bite about 20 seconds see we don't understand that I don't understand that at all you should have no problems you should be able to go out and out if you think going on but oh a few things going on and over there yeah well we're not looking for explosive details when you say a few things but I don't think she'd appreciate it but there is something going on yeah okay okay well we don't care the little something a big something that's not going to work on thing oh really we're back to that again okay the old flame we ought to play that by Elvis what's the name of that record his latest plane I think so I think that's the name of it you don't know anything about Elvis either right we every category we come to he doesn't know anything about whether it's sports movies no question about it the main thing is absolutely nothing about movies but of course the godfather was now part two was on what Friday night is Saturday Saturday I think and sooner or later they're going to come up with the long with the one where they got like a malan you're long there where they kind of put it all together yeah that already ran it's already god oh did run I've already got that but the dub is not good you know when you dub off of um table and get a much better quality right then when you make a dub off of another tape you're no question about for whatever reason yeah a couple of put it all together chronologically years ago back when he was working on a park ellipsen now I obviously know nothing about movies and the whole thing like you agreed with us yeah it's whole thing ran on NBC in order now actually what I'm talking about is the one where they had taken all the fish out they had the um outtakes yes I don't know the outtakes no not be out there what are they had added the movie other words it was about like a seven and a half hour yes and it ran on NBC the whole thing yes from

back together oh we could send him out now that we know you have a busy schedule baby that's a very very close right around you know very it's like in the neighborhood yeah or well we'll see maybe somebody will announce momentarily that someone is bringing lunch by doesn't that usually happen when we beg for food on the off and very often yeah and we're not gonna lose our cloud are we I mean we're still number one half yeah so by the way that card said that it's imminent you know all these people who abandoned the ship is thinking that ship is sinking you know that vigil host the good

Hmm. Fellow boys and girls. This is Mr. Rotterr. Welcome to my neighborhood skit. Oh, how does that smell Russian postman come red McFailock? A calming. You know he's kind of a funny postman. She's here. Not only does he deliver my name. He likes to open it too. I guess he just can't agree. Oh, shit. Hey, red Rogers! How is this to say for policemen? Please do me calling with me. But now. Can you say, times again, date? I think so. And you say, see, I is fine. Oh, shit. I'm on the door. It does for Downey of Oatinger. He needs to be watched. He's the Roger Hebervors. He likes from Siberia. For Nick. For me, yeah. Okay. By the way, this show has been different today. It's been interesting. But that is one thing that's been missing this morning. I just feel like we're insufficient. Like we have let something out. Now I feel a lot better. Okay, well listen to our feathered friends here in the building. Are going out to bring back a lunch. And as a result, when we come back following the news, we're going to be here. We're going to be here. Okay. Well listen, our feathered friends here in the building are going out to bring back a lunch. And as a result, when we come back, following the news break, I may be here all by myself for just a few minutes. So those who really want to capitalize on an occasion, a chance to speak to a superstar who cast 25 tickets to the Capitol last night. And lost his house, his car, everything. We do have a couple of lines open and date. We're some impatient morons hung up. You know, if they would hang around long enough, they would have gotten there just desserts. In date, 624, 9400, Broward 524, 9400, Mike Kowulf is reading right now. The local news section of the Harold trying to come up with some good headlines for the next newscast here. And we're going to see the S at the top of the hour for the World of National News minus the McLaughlin Piven spot in position one. Are you following that now? Look back at 1206. Still, if WI and Z lunch is on the way, and if Glenn and Dave happened to be listening just by accident, make sure that you get tons of farmers on cheese or raise somebody on a would say Parmesan. To bring back with us spaghetti, otherwise it's forgettable. I mean, nobody's going to be spaghetti without Parmesan cheese, right? I mean, like tons of it. Now, I figured since I'm going to go get my body wrapped on Wednesday, I just want to say that I'm going to get my body wrapped on Wednesday. You know, six or seven good meals today, and get prepared for it. Okay, let's go back to the call. Somebody in a day did drop off there. Six, two, four, nine, four, hundred, we'll start the shower and cross our fingers and pepper pines. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. This is his, his, his Highness, yes. His neighborhood, right? Yeah, his neighborhood ski. So, when I never heard that, how that's newer. Oh, you're so smart. That's old stuff. You know, we just bring it back to pacify a couple of people in the audience. But it always always works. It never gets old. Right. So, um, we're in for lunch, huh? You're in a white man's court. I can't let it. Correct. You can handle it? It sounds like you're in the process of handling your right now, sir. Oh, does it? Yep. Yes. Is it better for me now with everyone going? It's very, very common peaceful now. And I'm just curious as to what the dialogue is between David Glenn. In Dave's cars, they had up palm avenue toward Nicole's because there's a lot of potential. Mike, up on in for my advice. Yeah. Oh, did you wait a minute? Did you hear that? Do you hear that? That was done. Uh, I'd recognize it anywhere. I don't have a plan to tape anymore. There was the only reason I listened to the show. It wasn't on the air, but I heard it in my head. I heard this voice and I know it was done. Yeah. Okay. Did you notice that? Wait a minute. That was done. I'm positive. And I'm going to assign over my next 10 years paycheck. You've done we'll call in right now. To my favorite charity, okay? No, you're losing me. No, well, that's good. No, this is a soap opera. This whole station is a soap opera. And if you don't get all the components, you're lost. That's why you must listen. Non-stuff. You can't use me. You can't use me. But to tape it, if I had a four hour tape, I barely get the listen to the show. You throw it in a summer. Yeah. It was awesome. How are you doing these days? It's still awesome, man. Still awesome. Even without you, it's awesome. Without me. I know that's hard to believe, but trust me when I tell you, it's awesome. It's just a, I wish I could still listen to it. It is so awesome. I wonder what all those guys who win and it's called or done. It's Monday and called is not open day. And all those guys who win like 10,000 every day out there. They're jumping up the roof. Yeah, they ought to be on the roof. I'm so tired. He heard about all these guys who win and win. If they want so much money, how come they're still working? How come they're not retired living over on Santa Belor somewhere? Yeah, the top of the top of the top of the top. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, I guess we've a drain you of all your material. I had no material. Yeah. I just called to say hi and you know, well, I can't begin to tell you how wonderful it is to hear the sound of your voice. Just a bit of a long time, hasn't it? It really has. And then you've done something for me. Well, I hope you, I hope you've done a good work with that wrap. And don't, don't really push it on the pot. So take it easy. Okay. Just because, you know, why put us something that you could do today. Right. All right. Don't tell the British and hello. Sure. And I guess we'll talk to you maybe next to you. I'm so curious for how it goes. Yeah, say hi to Anne Sarah and Emily and Esther and the kids. And you know, and really about junior. You should let me a big kiss for us. Okay. See you later. I don't have any idea who that was, but we like, we like to treat all of our callers like members of this family. Like some big psychotic family, like on Dallas or something or like on not slanting. Like the McKenzie's on not slanting. And the save not slanting stuff for Friday because this Thursday night it's really going to be great when, Michelle Lee, this is the night finally when Michelle Lee and Pat Peterson. Prove that incest is best. That's coming up this Thursday night on not slanting. Coconut Grove. Hello. Theo. And I would pay a lot to watch that. Yes. Are you doing the day? Good. I just wanted to play the NFL rap song and honor of the games that went on. Okay. Here's our first football call of the day. I mean, it's after noon already and here's our first call. Obviously America has really been devastated. What did you watch yesterday? I watched it the bear game until they preempted and went to Washington. Wasn't that embarrassing? I mean, it was such a route and they just couldn't handle it anymore. And they went to the St. Louis Washington game. Right. And we got to listen to Joe size. Wasn't he great? Oh, he was almost as good as Terry a Bradshaw. I thought he was really good. And of course, though, you know, the Dick stock and wasn't chilling at all. And either was nerve-cross. No. When Norman Braiman said that they had everything but the Ku Klux plan in Philly, I thought that her was going to drop the microphone and his trousers or something. He just about went nuts. This is a pre-animator about Terry. Pretty heavy comment. Norm, pretty heavy. Yeah. I'm going back inside now. Do you want to retract that? Yeah. Yeah. It was interesting. And my only one to get it comes out on the low end of the story. And the stick. I mean, you know, and like I said, when Hank Goldberg says, the dolphins are on the 20th. And I said, hey, they're not the dolphins. Why are you even saying that? I think that's exactly the trick. So Joe, the whole thing is a big joke. So now we can be equally mad at both of the players for being a bunch of selfish morons who don't care about the fans. And the owners who are trying to pawn off, you know, who are so greedy that they're trying to pawn off this crap on the public and say, hey, this is the National Football League. I mean, who are they kidding? And the networks who, of course, being the total vaults, the worst prostitutes in the history of mankind who will do anything as long as they can sell it. Right. Right. And you know the thing, they should have had replacement announcers yesterday. Yeah. And they would have been, and because sometimes it looked like they had replacement technicians running the cameras. And, you know, the whole thing, what's going to happen if they get what they want is just going to be like the NBA, where the makers are in every year, the Celtics are in every year. Yeah. There's no reason even watch, you know, you just watch those bats you came for here. And I don't know. By the end of the afternoon though, you actually knew some of the people that were playing. That was frightening, yeah. Right. And they, which is right. That's exactly right. So I just wanted you to play that Super Bowl shuffle. The striker's shuffle. Yeah. For all of Jeff Spanes. I'd have probably appreciated. Okay. You got it. Thank you. I'll read the dirt. I'll read the dirt. I'll read the dirt. Drop that ball in the ground with a sign. We're going to walk up a big line. Striker's shuffle. That's the name. Cause the rate's gonna be no football game. Where's the players up to Janette Bell? We go on track to give the owners hell. We live like kings but feel like slaves. They're a couple hundred grand for just a few weeks. Yeah. The striker's shuffle. Uh-huh. The striker's shuffle. Well, the worst four years they've seen a late attack. I'm off the alley. Or a bigger gun track for a five-man passing. And half some fun. Build the policy. Who? Cause I have another one. Yeah. We're going to kick up the fence and hit off the rolls. Gonna move the LA to the end. But the gold. We're like that. I'll give you a call sometime you hear. Yeah. You're on his word. Really an air. So I'm gonna hear. Right. We're all spinning there. We're all the same. We're all the same. We're all the same. We're all the same. We're all the same. We're all the same. We're all the grand times. We set the odds. We got a big opportunity to win the round. And then the word really missed out. We're the fans. We work all week and day. Why didn't we cross for an end zone speed? We waited in line just to see the game benefit through it. All some sweet all the rain. Hey, we're the fan. We're sick of this crap. We just want football for dead all the flat. We buy the tickets. Pen and the shirts. You treat us like sheep and hat like jers. You act like shirts. Right. You're shuffle. You're a striker. You're a striker. Shut up. What a series is coming. You guys can take on. We're doing fine at the moment. Let's see NBA strikes. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. You can play a striker. We're more hazard by the way. Speaking of the striker shuffle at the Rams after their humiliation yesterday. I'm thinking of signing just striker as tight in for next week's game. And that ought to bring out a tremendous crowd in LA. Couldn't even close another seismic tremor in certain parts of the city like West Hollywood. Okay. It's 12.17. It's WIZ. Speaking of tremors, you asked for at least I asked for it. And according to the Herald this morning, so it must be true. The headline on this on the movie page page five. See, parts is now ready to sing different tune. We ordinarily would say tune. And it says Atlantic City New Jersey this time it'll be the men who parade around in bathing suits and formal attire and do quarter turns before a panel of judges. This time it'll be the men who object to being tight cast as sex objects. Because of course they are really simply honestly just role models for the youth of America. How you like that. Bird parks will be the MC, the US, Man of the Year Pagent. Will hit the ballroom of the expansive convention center in Atlantic City December 18 with Huffing and Skits and plenty of beef cake. This Saturday night, it's the annual near Miss of America Pagent. The air is the man who comes. All of his time, my last meal. I'm going to fly that the Atlantic City airport and watch his 50 of America's most beautiful wide bodies try to land on the same runway. You will be on the edge of your suit during the exciting forest landing competition. Then comes the traditional luggage losing contest. And it all wraps up with a breathtaking sudden decompression showdown. So from your seat back to a full and upright position and join us, will the annual near Miss of America Pagent? There's a phone ringing in the background while I reply in the National Anthem in S.O. The backphone. Oh, that must have been Rick's direct line to the ivory soap people. He's got a direct line in them. And it's been ringing and ringing for years and nobody ever picks up the phone at some problem. Okay, 12 night, what I want to clean up is act a little bit. 12 19 at WI and Z, and we'll come back right after this. There's a remarkable product for pain relief called therapeutic mineralize. It's an exclusive deep-cold formula, a penetrating gel that lots of doctors cover practice, clinics and physical therapists now use and recommend. All you do is apply mineralize where you hurt and it helps walk pain. Just stops at fast like the minor aching pains of muscles and joints from arthritis. Simple backage, strains, bruises, frames and related sports injuries. Only mineralize combines a clinically and medically proven ingredient in a deep penetrating, cool blue mineral gel. No grease, no sting, no unpleasant odor. A plymine of the gel is often as needed and let deep-cold pain relief do the rest. You'll feel pain let go. Muscle spasms relax. Then you can start to move and when you move your body does the rest. You'll work play and sleep better. Instead of taking pills, try mineralize to pain fighter.

Simpler is better, which is why med is the most chosen private practice health plan in Florida. So join us. I know that the Lord even loves Neorotters. Okay, I think we'll take this call from Volker because the book is always intriguing. Hello. I told you, just great. All right, great enough. Listen, I'm in the warm. I need it to be bright, and the only person I'd come to is yourself. You're sort of like a goddess or a word. A goddess, yeah. I'm trying to take it away, but forget it. I'm a big fan goddess, yeah. King not cook. The goddess of food. The food goddess. Speaking of it is a food question. You're putting the work of finding a Hungarian restaurant or something at church on Garing food. Yes. Why did I really catch you off guard, didn't I? Can you be a little more specific like a name I really... Well, if you give me a chance, if you calm down a little bit, I mean, is this something great moment in your life? Great moment. I met this Hungarian girl over a modest half unexpected, took me by storm. I went out on the first date, what do you have today? Everything's a success. She told me she likes... She likes... What's your question like, Hungarian food? She's from Hungary. And also, with this part of the second two-point question, it's like a place. I've never been into a play, like a Shakespeare or something similar to that. That was my second point. If you happen to know a good play out, that would have, you know, show a good show. Yeah, that's really nice to go to. All right, let me answer the first part of a question first, okay? Now, you're way up in Volca, you don't expect me to give you one up there, do you? No, no, anyway, don't want to. Okay, the Hungarian Charda... Charda. I think it's... I don't know how you spell it. See... The HR... The HR DA, or there's an SNS or whatever it is. And it's on this game Boulevard, like a North Day, in North Miami. This game, and around 140, or 150, is it right in there? And to believe me, everybody's always had good things to say about it. Okay, that's good. Yeah, and they have like Hungarian musicians in the music and the... The real authentic thing. She'd just freak out. As far as the plays are concerned, like Parker play house with that, I'm definitely out of my realm. Now, when the bird brain gets back, that's right up his alley, so I'll be sure to ask him if he keeps listening. I'd appreciate it. So I'm sure that you could really, you know, have a great evening, a little dinner with the Charda, and then, you know, we'll find a great place for it. You go to a play. But enough, I got two other comments on sports, if I can't really quit. I think the only people I'm probably happy for this strike, would probably be the people from Indianapolis, so they ended up winning yesterday and anyone big time, I know. Yeah. At the take-in by storm. And who do you like in the baseball playoffs right now? Who should take for this series? Well, I like the Tigers. I hate to say it, but, you know, in fact, I did pick the Tigers, even when they had dropped about four games out, and it looked impossible. Charda did one of the great jokes in the history of baseball. Yeah, I remember. And lost their last seven in a row, which is almost unheard of. And they, you know, the Tigers have got them all meant to me. They're getting great pitching, and, you know, I think it's Detroit all the way. With that great weather, too, you know? Yeah. I got one comment. I just was over here bugging me. If you have a chance to put the end of the show, or did you play that song as you dedicated to that sunny Rosenberg? Or did my boyfriend's back or something like that? Oh, yeah. Please, we just appreciate it, honestly. We all appreciate what you already did for us. What did I do for you? I made some great advice. Oh, yeah, I gave you a good restaurant. I'm telling you. Excellent. Excellent. Okay, well, when the Bergams back, we'll see what we can do for you. No, you know. Okay, I'll be standing by. Okay, I'll read the dirt. Audio and stand by me. We're going to vote again to an arrow from Bokeh. Hello. Hi, you guys. Boy, you're just as good as the previous car. I'm a first time caller. Great. And maybe I have a comment, or maybe to question. I can't understand all this controversy. I hear on the news or reading the paper. Why people protest your show. I think you're great. You do a terrific job. You're better than any doctor and in time, any medications. The press. Oh, I do what's called your start. Listen to your station. I just think. Well, there are a lot of people who just can't turn the dial. That's all who want to be censored. And dictate what we can say and what we can do. And I'm just not going to tolerate that. I'm going to keep doing what I've always done. First of all, I have to do. It was turning off. You got it. Well, listen, it's great talking to you. I love your show. Keep up the great work. You're terrific. Thanks a lot. Okay. Bye bye. Boy, two great calls from Volca back to back. That's almost enough to make you say, you know, we can't talk that. Let's just stop it right now and put on some Hungarian melodies or something and just enough is enough because when you reach a certain pinnacle. And having to notice that our feathered friends have a return with lunch here. What is it? 26 past noon. Getting hungry, Bob? Yeah, I can smell. Let's forget it already. And of course, just mounds of parmesan cheese as Mr. Eagle would say on another station Parmesan cheese. As you sniffle and smacks his lips and his all kinds of gutter-roll things on a year. Okay, let's go to Fort Lottodale. Hello? Well, yeah. Yeah, how you doing? Good. What's up? Oh, what? Hey, this is Steve. I called you a couple weeks ago with the definition for an amount of P.F. Oh, yeah. I remember. This must be Arling Wistick's expert. How are you doing, Steve? All right, you all right. I got, uh, you know, K.S.D. How about you? Oh, not bad. How are you doing, yeah? Okay, dude. What's up? That must do. Okay. Um, well, it's been nice talking to you. Yeah. You got the U.V. where you've lowered the capacity. Oh, yeah. Someone who is really sharp and aware. That's right. Someone who can see through all the BSs, someone who can cut through the malange of Mung that kind of vuster rounds our life. I get to the substance of your show, yeah. Yeah, that's it. That's the substance that malange of Mung. And you know, when you mix that up with some Ville Parmesan, you put it in the microwave, boy, you really got something. Hey, you get the equals out the bird. Yeah. Um, do you want to know what it means? Can you see, can you see a vaultress stuff with Ville Parmesan, lightly basted and cooked at 350 in the oven for about 2 1.5 hours. Boy. Yeah, that sounds really good. When you say it when you look at that, that equals that your morning super star. I mean, oh, yeah. Now, I think, I would take about 4 mounds of Mung the equal early, just one cheek, I think. So, you're not doing the news anymore. Well, our lead is going to be a real super star starting next Monday, I think. We've got little new wrinkles in our morning news. This is a matter of fact. And can I give you just a little preview? Do you want to hear it? Yeah, got it. Here's a little preview of the morning news on WI and Z. Six Dye and earthquake in LA. 42 Parisians jet cranks. Suicide on the metro rail. Details in 60 seconds. That's a preview of our new form. I want to get everybody in a good mood, you know. That's pretty good. I like that. Yeah. With one. That's a lot. Hey, listen, we've got it all here. We've got stuff on tape that hasn't been invented yet. We're just waiting for them to invent it so we can play it. Oh, you know that, uh, which, uh, which, Macau, the, uh, striker shuffle? Yeah. I don't like that. That's, that's, it's kind of boring. You should, I like it. Well, somebody wanted to hear it. And the guys, obviously, in, uh, withdraw, had piqued withdraw. Okay. Where, where, where, where, we wanted to be calling from focus? No, that would do. There was another guy from focus. That's the guy with a Hungarian girlfriend. I have to after holding on the phone for so long. I start going into a mental lab. Well, they all start melding in together. Lies in a melding pot. Exactly. I was the next caller. And then, and then I got cut off. Right. Right before the news. What do you mean you for the noon, the news? Uh, I remember the news. All right. Who's your new board off? Board off? Yes. You had a new board off. Didn't you call it was gone? Kyle has gone and Bob Rolland is our new engineer. Don't say board off. That's such a big meaning. You know. I mean, he is only making two and a half bucks an hour, but still board off. This should be meaning, too, or, you know. Okay. These are technical assistant engineer, choreographer, do you sure? Is he off the drive train? Nobody. So, wicked lunch. I'll tell you that. Please, ladies and gentlemen. Yeah. See, one thing I'm a little worried about. Kyle is a, like a finicky eater. It was very picky. And as a result, when we used to get a lot of free meals in here at noon time, we didn't have to worry about him eating us out of a house in home. There was a lot left for everybody else. Bob on the other hand, uh, can, you know, really put it away. I know question about that. See, like, a 200 pounder. No, but he, you know, he has a mismitting meals lately. There's no question. So, we could be in for a lot of trouble. In fact, he and the bird may come new. I was going to say, may come to blows at some point, but I'm sure some people in the audience would misinterpret that. And we don't want to do that. We don't want to remove the image. As far as the birds concerned, what is there to protect? Yes, we see the ring. We understand. That's always a good, uh, front. What's that? All right. I forgot why I was calling. I'm going to start, you know, I'm going to start wearing a wedding ring. Do you think they would help my image? Uh, of course I'm going to wear it in my ears, so that might, uh, my right ear, but that might change something. If you were a wedding ring, that might kill your action. You think so? Yeah, definitely. Well, I don't think there's any to kills, but don't worry about it. Well, listen, have a wonderful life. I'm not so sure I know what we talked about, but it was good for me. Hell, Neil. Yes. I'm down. You're getting ahead of yourself. Was it good for you, Steve? It was great. Okay. Oh, yeah. I'm sure there must have been one. Yeah, the personality. Oh, yes. You wanted to give me the definition of perspicacious. If you don't even remember why I called them. Okay. Well, it seemed like hours ago. Okay. It's, um, it's a keen metal perception. Right. Like, you say that like you already knew what it meant. I don't know what it means. I just already told you moments ago what it means. It did. It means the ability to see through all the BS to be very perceptive. Oh, I, I thought you were just, uh, I was just yanking your nose. Oh, yeah. What I was doing when I told you, you think I would use words that I don't know the meaning of, like, Don Webb. Come on. Or, uh, get there. Get there. Get there, get there. All right. Well, if you know it, then, uh, you know what? To know what is to love it. And to love it is to know it. You got it. Listen, have a wonderful day and the great circus. I'm sure it's coming up almost any day now. Yeah. Thank you, too. Thanks a lot. For what a good group of calls we've had today. I don't know what it is. There must be something in the water in the year. 1232 and W.I.N. Z.R. Next caller. Well, this could break the trend because it's from Fort Latterdale. Hello. Yeah. See, I told you, I just know it. I'm getting, like, psyche lately, like Reverend DeAnima. I'm getting really psychic. I just can always tell when it's at Fort Latterdale. Think I never speak to which and for Latterdale. Probably because there are a bunch of Nazis on the line over there. You know what I'm saying? Some of those brown shirts. Real Nazis in Fort Latterdale. Wanna chase all the young kids out and just generally. I'll bunch of fascist pigs. I think that's fair. Oh, is this caller from Fort Latterdale, too? Hello. It's a lie. I'm not a knife. Okay.

You don't want to tell he ignores. He just knows what tension What I say. He didn't let us last the other day. There was like a little interaction. It's like I'm going in this direction. He's just rising to a clinical exercise. Listen to every word. Like the top of the tower, you know, you said that it's not like some of that other ice cream but other places. Did you ever see them put a new beacon light on top of one of the tower? Hmm. Boy. You're going to be a supervisor up there. Just kind of hover over there. The vaults are hovering over the tower.

Okay. Just reminiscing over some of the waste and blast night at Pomp and all, you know, it's early in the season. You have to wait till the give a little form and they've all been over the track a few times. And you have a chance to, you know, cleanse your soul a little bit. Tung and clean out your wallet and start fresh with new money. They like your new money. And we're going to make a little call out. Bob. I hope she's home. This is the right number. Who is it that Howard's call? He's calling Jessica. Oh, I'm the timer. Donna Rice, please. It's calling. On your Rogers at WINZ? I'm sure not here, but I think that's it. Uh, what time do you expect her? Well, I'm not sure. This is she will be back? I expect her back. She's been a process with moving. Yeah, I know. Okay. We'll just tell her that we call, okay? Okay. Okay. Okay. I'll tell her. Thanks a lot. Okay. Donna's not in, but that was definitely the right number. What is it? Oh, isn't that interesting? I wonder who that lady is there with Donna in her house? Oh, Lee. Oh, Lee. Oh, yes. Something to think about isn't it? You don't have a dog John's phone number there. Uh, that was a couple of things I want to ask him. That was Donna. Uh, is he here that? Is he here that? I think there's going to be a sarcastic message on the other end of this, probably. This is Donna's number. Was given to me by somebody on the inside. No, body home, but if you leave your name, the time you call, then... Hey, that dog get back to the house. That's Donna. Ooh, that's right, can't. Thank you, lot. Hey, Donna. That's so cool. That's not like, I've heard that voice somewhere. Yeah. I can't. I can't put my finger on it. But boy, it sounds familiar. Yeah. Bring the bell of me. Okay. We're going to, well, get that. We're going to, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to, we're going to, We're going to, we're going to play that 700 times. I've reached out. Oh, we're going to, we're going to play that 700 times. Oh, we're going to, we're going to play that 700 times. That's when you get the flavor of it. Yeah. And it sinks in. I think that's the, well, we can dump it if it's bad. Oh, this ought to be going to be so embarrassed. Hi. Celebrity answering phone, a new segment on WI and Z. Where'd be something of was Henry Winkler? There were a lot of lipstick, Henry Winkler. And I don't know movie, just like in regular life. He wears heavy lipstick. Good message on this. Obviously, I'm going to let me sum him more on. Obviously, it doesn't hook up his machine, right? Obviously, I'm home. Very lucky for somebody we all know for you to tell the Mac tonight. A hit, but grounds out the Mac message, it says, And there's a picture of the moon here. And it's a picture of the moon here. It says, look out, old Mac might not be back. The lunar crew in her Mac tonight, who sings the praises of dinner at McDonald's and TV ads, has ended. A five week test run. What a run. We action to the question head character who sings rewritten lyrics to the tune of body Derrick's, I think if you're not hit Mac tonight, was phenomenal. Phenomenal says McDonald's folks will make Terry McCapatocio. As many as 50 hundred people showed up to meet back when he appeared at Asia, Coglorium McDonald's restaurant. And it just goes on forever. But the fast food king might not bring Mac back because he distracted you from the idea. They tried to persuade you about buying dinner there. He might be buying dinner. When that's five plays, it's nauseating to begin with because it's been on eight million times. But when they say dinner at McDonald's, that's when you start just laughing. His story dinner at McDonald's. Oh, yeah, get the whole family. And go on for a big Mac tonight. That'd be dinner. A big Mac and a big fly. Speaking of tedious repetition, here he is ladies and gentlemen. But nothing is going to dissuade him from his appointed rounds because he is an absolute X to see look at the book. It's like a man set free. A man released from every game. We could rip him for hours on end. In fact, maybe that's a good idea. But nothing's going to bring him down. So to speak. Okay, let's take some more calls and we do have that number which I'm saving for a future and others. For Waterdale. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you doing great? My talk's on Saturday. Wait a minute. You recognize this voice? That's done. That's done. I know that voice anywhere. Don't. How are you doing? I'm going on. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I'll get you right away. That was fun. Do you want to stand by me? No. Yeah. Did I watch you? Yeah. Did you want to talk about it? You didn't hear the beginning of the show today. We did like an hour on it. We didn't. Are you good? I had a question. Go ahead. I'll ask you. What's the answer? I don't know. What's the answer, Mr. Expert? I was like a big thing in the movie. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. What's the answer, Mr. Expert? I was like a big thing in the movie. I know the big thing. Wait a minute. Maybe he needs a little inspiration. Hold on. Just one second. I think he needs a little inspiration. Okay. Here we go. Uh. It's Bill McQueen's clock. It's beat the clock. I'm going to have to answer the question. No, the bird. I can't. And I'm stumped. I could have swine her dog up. Wait, didn't I? Yeah. I could have swine her dog up. Wait, didn't I? Yeah. So what's that? He's good, crackling a little, sir. I don't know the answer. No risk, crackle, because I think you stumped him, finally. Yeah. He had no clue. What's the question? No. No. He's a dog, making the mouth down to duck. What's busy? I don't know. Did they answer? They didn't answer? They didn't answer? They couldn't figure it out? Right. I can't figure it out either. Well, listen. Listen, enough of this stupid trivia. I want to direct your question. You can keep you, guys. Um, yeah. By the story. Well, that's what I meant. All right.

Anyways, I was starting to say that's very good. That's a translation. There's a picture of river Phoenix and Will Wheaton. Oh, hey, I thought something not for you. When you mentioned this name is Will Wheaton. Yeah. I said it was a good thing. I'll river. Didn't eat wheat because of that for him. Yeah. A lot of things. I think it's a good thing. I'll river. I think it's a good thing. Yeah. A lot of allergies here. And will he does that with the guy said he's looking for him? Yeah. Like I said, like, late. Pretty late. Was he going to do the shock radio thing? No. Well, they were doing their impression of shock radio. A shock radio? They've been doing that for a long time over there. Can tell the bad joke they've shot themselves. Oh, yeah. So they're going to be a show with the other way. Either way, there's a rumor that four runaway estes escape from the Zeta studio this morning. During the playing of station stuff. And that's all you're right with. No one in your favorites. Yeah. So they're in the YouTube pretty heavy now. I think. Yeah. I think that's where every 15 minutes they got to meet their YouTube quote. By the way, Peter, if Peter Boulders was the one who know what we're playing by Brian Adams and I forgot and he to the night is one of them that I've had planned. But I forget what the other one is. I don't know. The employee one is six strings. Hertz. The employee is that one. It hurts, yeah. Okay. Well, that's new, they're just, you know. They didn't play that much in the movie. Wait a minute.

Listen, I want you to listen to this very carefully. And Alok, are you ready? I... And I want you to try in your mind to envision like all the pieces of the puzzle coming. This might even enable you to answer your own question. All right. All right. No, you. Woo! Have a great work. You're going to be a great one. That's kind of like Harley, and... You're going to eat it. You can eat it. No? Hey, boss, it's pretty good. By the way, Dave, it's an old-fashioned. All right, wait a minute. We're going to add one more element. Okay, this is going to do it now. What's the... I'm fine. I don't get it. You won't get it. I'm going to try and get it here, sir. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Tell me. It hurts. Hello. Okay. Pardon me? I think that was thought. You know what I'm saying? That doesn't sound like it's like... Did you notice that? That sounded like Johnston didment. You're dead. He isn't that incredible. Okay. You could have no changes just like Johnston. Where you going, sir? I think I've decided. Okay, thank you. Hello. Yeah, she did. Oh, you. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. You won't get it. Johnston, she's going to hurt him. Thank you. Thank you. No. Hello. I'm fine. Hello. Only here. Hello. Okay. What? Pardon me? I think that was thought. You know what?

You got the answer to his question. Yeah. Excellent. We finally figured it out. Before I leave, I want to request a question without you by YouTube. Yeah, right. Okay. We'll be playing the Joshua Tree for our ice cream friends a little later on. All right. Are you going to go? Are there any YouTube we don't have you now? Are they? Yeah. And PTO, the door is never forget the door. CCR. CCR. Then that's about it. But more do you need. A little Bruce brings thing every now and then. The boss. Yeah. Is the new one. Yeah. I hear the boss and it makes me toss my lunch. You like the boss? I hate the boss. Good. Yeah. Good thinking. I knew Dave had good taste. Oh, wait a minute. The door is opening and lady. The gentleman here is, the door is creaking open to the WIZ. Talk studio and here he is. I know all of us already. This is old news about the church we talked about this Saturday. And my show where we had substance. We weren't clenching and carrying on about. Should somebody cut their hair. We'd by the way, I need to haircut very bad. Yeah. There we are. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That would be in the same statement. That would be pretty exciting day. Delete, funded. What are you doing with that mic? Look at that. He's just dumb. What? What's wrong with it? Take it over. Take it over. Take it over. Ha ha ha. So he said, let's not what I'm doing. Ha ha ha. I will hear it. We heard there was something deep news coming to the stand major audience today. Look at that. He's even got a little he can't resist. There's a little smirk on his face. Notice that he just is trying to play it this way. So to speak. Big news. I'm sure that you can, you know, That Marshall Moore, he comes in here on his own. He's like, we're still like in a tornado. Like we have like a 9.3 on the Richter scale. We're still putting the room back together. This mic's so loud. Oh, wait till you hear this car. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah, the hips just keep on coming. Oh, okay. I want to I'm reading this. I'm not making it up. It says. Wait a minute. I love it. When you start to crusade like you did Thursday, Your little eyes flash and your voice becomes high. I've pitched and shrill. Into the veneer comes off your homosexuality Or your underwear is too tight. Forget the heavy issues and continue your Voyerism and making up excuses to not meet women. Unsyme. We're. Yeah. P.S. did you like the veil? Ha ha ha ha. Why? Chet they say about you? No. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Long brains. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There were the tube big, long brains. And this is right after he came running out to Shake our hands and apologize. I don't know what that was a positive. We've got them being an idiot. I can push me out of the way. Did he? Poor Marcy. Oh, yeah. It's all his fault. She's perfect. She's nice. Yeah. Yeah. He's my fault. See this man is so overcome by his hormones. He just came to control himself. Just a walking hormone. Did. Don Johnson call Glenn? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh, you. On time. I don't care. You won't. You don't care. Yes. Don Johnson is a good haircut. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Hello. Hello. Only it. Hello. Okay. Pardon me? I say I was done. You know what that? That's not a lie. John's been dead. He's on the camera with another hot nymph in there. Okay. Well listen, it makes you happy. I'm sure it was done. Yeah. Let's think of both. We all think it was done. Absolutely. Okay. West Boca. Hello. What do you think? I think it was Joe Joe. Oh, I was. Post but not a minute. Joe, you're rental and the board goes back. I'm like that. So hey, how about the chains? Yeah. I told you the chains were going to win all the way. I didn't think it was going to happen the way it did. But you know, the winners are win. You know that that will weaken from that step by the end of the do start track. Oh, forget it. Forget it. He's an ugly little kid. All right. Did you see who was on the end of the weekend, by the way? I'm afraid to ask small potatoes. Oh, you mean this past weekend. Yeah. Mr. Mr. Mr. Potato. Is he good? Was it contrived? It was so when you would expect pretty much. It was him and Robert Dova, you know, of evidence and no back. What were they arguing about? What do you want to guess? The football strike. Oh, of course. And we know that Mr. Potato is very objective. And this SST or whatever. I thought that was an aircraft as some combat. Anyway, this SST thing is has really got so much credibility. It's so apparent. Mr. Robby, you know, support the scabs come out pay 26 bucks a game to watch a bunch of lungheads play football because naturally Mr. Robby is always right. And of course, his crusade has nothing to do with the fact that they run the game. So yeah. No. No, when for coincidence exactly, one another one of those strange coincidences. Thanks. It was pretty bizarre. Did you hear Joey by the other day trying to do the only you because you were playing the wrong version of the state? He anchors that yeah. It's not actually like the Beast people are just up to like a raft kind of scratch. You know, it is the Beast people are just up to like a raft kind of scratch. It is the Beast people are just the Beast people are just doing Frankie Valley. If you listen to me, you're just a beast. Yeah, that's my favorite. I'm going to sing a vibe but I want to play you a little something here. So just stand by me. Is that me? Is that me? Is that me? Is that me? Is that me? Is that me? I'm tired. I'm tired. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's me. It's Superman. Hey, it's a little bit of a silent presser. The case works with power that the authorities find the arms closed and start a man. Superman who can be found building something to buy. They can see the bullet switch targets. They can see that it's air-hand. And we'll just die just first. I'll find a good boy and it's a good paper. Fight, let's never anything that will. Let's do it. It's a nonsense. A normal story. Hey, that's a better thought. It's been a nice 30-30-30. Okay, well, listen, it's been great, but... I can't wait for Bud Carrier to come back. Stay in. I used to listen to you when you first came out in June, but lately, have been listening to Alice Rental. Today, I told you when and heard you screaming about the new gun law. I could not believe how you were hanging up on people and calling them jerks. Really, stand being rude to people is very unbecoming of you. If you think it will help your enemic ratings, I'm afraid you may be very mistaken. Since, surely, a sporadic listener, PS, are you and Neil Rogers lovers? Can't quite figure you out. The thought of that is just so mind-boggling that it's like an understatement. Oh boy, mind-boggling. I mean, with all due respect. Let's get serious, okay? It's 18-2-2, a W-Y-N-Z. Dave is here just by adjusting a wonderful lunch. He's ready. You're going to go to work at what time now? Five o'clock. Yep. So everybody is going to be heading for the Melping Pot in the cross-brings, so I can ask for Dave to wait on them. Of course you can't wait on everybody. No, I can't. But I'll wait on you, Dave. I'll wait on you, Dave. I'll wait on you, Dave. I'll wait on you, Dave. You'll take them on. Well, don't put nanos via me, sir. Yeah. Well, maybe go come and invite you next. You're next. It was in the way you know what he's pushing for, don't you? You know, now we know already where is a little chain. They like to have his name and gold, you know, by 18 pounds of gold, I ain't from his neck. Okay, so while you hear that, and of course, to eight o'clock tonight, we don't want any pain and he asked by a standard. Bugging, I'm going with an old friend of mine and his friend. We're going to have a nice quiet dinner for a couple of hours. Physi-old. older than I am. He's not old, but he's older. A friend of long standing. I was bad. Okay. Is it ongoing?

Last night they were talking about making him manager of the Croll Springs location. Lord. Why? Why? Yeah. Because of as Robby Low always says, Robby Low, where did that come from? As Rob Low loves to say, you notice in every one of his movies he has a little French line throws in like an Oxford Blues. He's a little sudie there on the sun. Hmm. And if you haven't seen about last night with Rob Low and. You haven't seen it. You haven't seen it. You're a big favor and watch it. You'll enjoy it. There are a lot of fleshy scenes in there. They can call us when tomorrow. We're going to have people call up a weather. They like that movie or not. It's not even a contest. It's a good movie. No, and with my crowd would Rob Low and their naked. Do you think you have any chance? I would just be kidding. Do you think you have any chance with my audience at the. This audience isn't going to be just here. Even the straight guys in the audience are following that the mouth over that movie over. Oh, if you over. Did they more? Yeah. Yeah. He's okay. But she just the sex list. You know, Phoebe Cage was up for that role. She and Michael J. Fox. Phoebe Cage. That was actually what? That was Rob Low and her would look a lot alike. Yeah. Yeah. It would have almost been like standby me two boys. Okay. It's 145 out of your. No, not out of my mind. Phoebe Cage was like a guy. I'm sorry. I can't help it. Did that. Do you like Phoebe Cage too? Yes. I beautiful. You got that one picture of her with a hair short. She looks just like Robby Benson or somebody. Robby Benson is retired. Well, he's a what a thing that it wouldn't tell her. Thing that is to say, Robby Benson is retired. I hate that guy. Hit him. Oh, you like him. Oh, he's a movie. He had the monkey. What was that movie? Where he had the pet monkey. And he was running right. Every movie. And he directs like his own. You know, he's like a flasher. Robby. He always has to have his underwear on. At least one thing. You know, monkey. Yeah, he had the monkey. And they got running around with that girl and chasing through the Arabs and the Tent and all business. Strange, sick movie. I think he hallucinated. Oh, not hallucinating that movie. He had a pet monkey in that movie. The monkey was in his underwear. It was incredible. Well, I must have missed that one. Yeah. And I don't miss any of them. Robby Benson will be. Yeah. I'm sure that. Oh, I. Pembley of death. It's 14th. You're right. You're right. It's 11 before two at WI and Z. Stan is feverishly hunting for the. Don John. I don't know if that's not an omen for what's going to happen next for hours. I'll put this show there. Is that what he said? He's going to need promise to be swear and blood. For waterdale. Hello. A voice from Fort Waterdale. Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no. Yeah. Yeah. But never. But never the last week. Yeah. And it was whiskey. And you played a small segment of having a while weekend by rock and rebels. And then she swore on records. And I don't know. And then she's killed. And then she's killed. And then she's killed. Yeah. Yes. What's all I got to do with anything? Nothing. No, I don't know. Wait a minute. You said there was no contact controversy with. Swore records. Oh, there is. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know the amount of while we can in a rock and rebels? I know that. Yeah. What's all I'm feeling about that? I don't know. What's all I'm feeling about that? The whole field is that they never got a diamond royalties from that record. You're kidding me. No, I'm not kidding you. And they had many of it. So it's one. Did they? Yeah. Well, not like that one. No, that one sold over a million copies. Why did they get just out of that guy? Because Tommy Shannon and Joey Reynolds were like involved with the contract. There's something or their manager. Something like that. You're playing the record. You play in the record. You was Tommy Shannon's theme song. You're kidding. And they never got a dime. And I know that because one of the members of the band told that to me in a little bar in Buffalo, New York. No, kidding. Many moons are good. They have to be seen anyway. They'll look at it. In fact, we're going to give them Joey's home address in plantation. They want to make them an offery can't review. I'm trying that decision. Yeah, I was Tommy Shannon's theme song. He used it in Detroit, too. It's a key element. I'm sorry. I'm trying to get the player there. I haven't heard of play. Probably too embarrassed to play that on the show. I haven't lived the long enough. Because then he'd have to talk about the rock and rebels. And we'd have to find out the real story behind this story. And the whole host of people who got screwed by certain folks from Buffalo, record promoters, concert promoters. The list is legendary. Yeah. Yeah. Back to that. Back to the rest of the story. In fact, maybe we'll get Joey to catch a check for Larry King. What do you think? Okay. Good luck to you, sir. Thank you. And now you have the rest of the story. Boy, that's Paul Harvey. You see boring or what? Very boring. Terminal. Comotose. Not a big fan of him. Other than that, he's not a bad guy. Call of you. Well, he's from Chicago. He's got one good thing. Call of Jebel, Silo. Well, yes, sir. I want to start this phone call by saying, can you do me a favor for... Don. Wait a minute. I just don't hang up. Wait. Say something, sir. Get a play with you that is now. Yeah, we got that here. I went to E-Macaboyo. Oh, boy. Now, who did you molest up there, sir? Go all the way up there. Yes. And you're talking about a bubble bursting party. This person I saw was damn major. That'll do it. Looks like the leprechaun on a leaky torn cereal box. Now that you mentioned it, he does. He doesn't look like the leprechaun. You know, kind of blown up a little bit. I can personally saw, was the bird. Yes? But it's not like the bird. It looks like the other part of Leechillet. Not the cannellops. Shame on you, sir. Fucking penis. Oh. What a shot. That didn't kneel. Yeah. Oh. You look like a human hammer. Yes, that's me. Then you got that 48. Yep. This man wanted us to play something for him. He just insulted all of us something here. Say I think about me. No. But you weren't there. That's true. You weren't there. He would be ripping you too. I don't think. And what do you look like? Mr. Mong. Beautiful. Just beautiful. Put you look like clawed rains. Long shainy and the hunchback of notes for a dime. I mean, who do you look like? Just beautiful. Probably looks like sunny fox with the banana of his mom. That's like just right. Well, listen, you've been so complimentary to us. We have to play this for you. You think this will win you over? Maybe. Unlikely. Hey, young man. That's not seeing you hanging around my house in the night. I want to talk to you about what you need to be. Listen here now. I want to put it this way. Yeah. Wasn't you who did the push-in? Put the same, the palm of the push-in. Put Prince on the dashboard upside down. Hey, what? Who wasn't you? You brought up a bill. Been messing with my daughter Jill. If it was, you'd better leave this town. Well, I'm gonna say. If you just stood down. You did your push-in. Put your things here, phone. You could even put your tongue. You could even put your tongue. You guys bowed up that day. Yeah. Yeah. You were so familiar with your daughter. I had a terrible passing water. So I guess we're just laying all around. What are you waiting for? Come on. Come on. No, no, no. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hey, people, we've talked about it at the water cooler. And that's what we all strive for every day. You know, good. I don't have anything related to this. How about a can? Let's just go to a pay phone and Ojas, hello. I have to follow this. Yeah. Oh. Oh. Okay. Well, when requested a pay phone and Ojas, so I... Well, when you will live in Ojas, you have a heavy cross to be yourself. Are heavy load to carry. Get right. I understand that. As a matter of fact, I've been hanging on so long. Is it that you can do policy keep him hanging to a driver? That's it. You got it. I've only got down to my knees so far, but anyway. Let's see. What kind of material do I have for you today? Nothing. Nothing very good. Nothing you're striking. Well, listen. Oh, really? Won't be the first. From coin from a pay phone and a mobile station, Is that count as a mobile call? No, only from Amico. Oh. Amico or Xson? I got you. Is it a win there? No, what is busy looking for a phone number for Stan? Oh. I probably looking for Marcie's home number. I hesitate to say anything about Stan because I mean, I listen to the show Friday. Yeah. And I heard him do that poll. The only hey, he said he had 120 calls. They were only three of them. They were only good. I said, this week, followers. Yeah. They're who cares. And what did the third guy say? I don't know. So did I get such a doubt? It really. But anyway. Yeah. Moving right along. Right along, right? Uh, gee, I had so many things to talk to. Go in about it. I guess we're not going to get a chance for them. I'm going to have to talk to you about it. They've even said about the turn. Is Mike Ovee? You can talk to Dave about it. Dave? Yes. The last one. I dare it. Go ahead. Hello? Yes. You can talk to me about that. About what I was going to talk to Glenn about? Yeah. I don't think that's uh... Yes, it is. He speaks for Glenn. I don't think that's. Is he that? Give it a shot. Well, no. Well, Glenn likes to find out things about Ogeus. You know, and I was wondering if he had any more questions about Ogeus. Do you have any questions about Ogeus? No questions. No. A question with non-speechless. Well, actually, you know, while we're thankful that Glenn isn't here right now. I'm not originally from Ogeus. If you were from medley, we might get into that. No, no, no. Actually, I'm from the state of New York just like you, New York. We're about. I grew up in the city of. In what? The city of. Do you understand what he said? The city of. You never heard of the city in New York? The city of New York. Boy, this guy's a real irregular comedian. Well, you know, it's not just... Another one of those New York wise guys. You know, we know your types. Probably from the Bronx. Anyway, I have to say that I... I... Well, when Stan thought it to show Saturday, I had to turn it off. Really? Yeah, because he was playing that thing. Oh, but you should have left it on because you would have been astonished if how many more times he played both? No, you wouldn't have imagined anybody would have had to go to do it. I mean, just over and over and over and over and over. I mean, at the point where the statement was trying to shut itself off. I caught it, fly the frocking. He was still doing it. No, no. I got on stuff. I think he's assadored. Oh, he's gonna think I'm trashing him on your phone. That's okay. No problem. He's an ex-discivenation. I understand he finally broke a long drought and he's all excited. Oh, and that's... A long drought. A long drought. Nothing will upset him now. Yeah, does that give you a little hint? No. Well, okay. Have you had it enough of this today? More than enough. More than enough. Yeah. I've got the material I haven't even thought of yet. Well, give us, call tomorrow. We'll see. You know, you're still a warning. And, you know, we'll see how long we can keep you on hold tomorrow. I took when I said, well, okay. Thank you so much. Look at that. There's the big bad wolf. Isn't that cute, boy? With his mask and all, but he's practicing now. He's getting ready for that big morning thing. And the hell never be the same again. You know, he thinks one hour with our lead is something that he can sure find. But we'll start to pull it down. Tens will tell you everything. Yeah, pulling down your pants, maybe. But that's about it. Anyway, we think day for stopping by for another indescribable lunch. No problem. Yeah, no problem. Sure. Easy for you to say. Lunch was great. In fact, the aroma of the marinara sauce and the meatball. It made you almost want some meal promised yarn. And it made you get in the mood for that. So, Jimmy and the mustard. Maybe some more jewelry by the melting pot tonight. Yeah, that's for day. He's the one who wants all the heavy jewelry. And I'd like well for the headlines. He'd be asked for the world news and stand major is going to be, boy, he got some wild stories for you. If you believe him.
