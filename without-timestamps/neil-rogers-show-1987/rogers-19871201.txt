Speaking of that, you know, the beauty shop in the, uh, Volkertown Center. Well, uh, they've dorked got his hair done at that beauty shop. And I was sitting there waiting.

And I tell you, it was like, like I see it out of L'acashap full. It was one of the most incredible experiences of my lifetime. And one of the guys, one of the hair stylist was getting his hair done. Uh-huh. And he had his hair all up in curlers and was just camping it up something fierce. And I was sitting there cracking up. And then one of the young ladies, one of his customers came in. She had an appointment to get her hair done. So he aches out all the curlers and he's got all these wild curls flowing around. And he's just, uh, doing a tap dance up and down that place. You wouldn't have believed it. It was the most incredible experience. Look like I had, we were getting his haircut at the copa or something. I'm sorry. What's phenomenal. And you know what station they were listening to? No. What station? How many guesses do you need? This station. This station. Yeah. You'll find all the queens on Zeta 4. Trust me. I don't know why.

All your listeners are all butch and macho man and they lift weights and a hangout together in the steam room in the shower. 17 before eight on Zeta 4, where should we go next? As Lee has got that, like macho hangup. Oh, I see. He is like, uh, geez. This show freaked him out. Yeah. He couldn't handle this. He saw that Jeff Stryker picture and he got excited. That's what bothered him. Okay. Let's go to a day county. Hello. Hello, man. Yes sir. Yeah. I can't believe you're getting away with what you're doing on that. Readiest station. What is that sir? Uh, talking about, uh, uh, well about the queen. Can't believe it. What, why not? Well, you can't do that. Where I'm from, man. Can't talk about royalty on your show on your stations. Well, uh, yeah, royalty. Yeah, don't. Don't the British worship the queen. Yeah, that's right. And don't the Canadians still have a soft spot in their heart for the queen. Uh, soft spot. Yeah. Yeah. That's it. Soft spot. That's right. Precisely. So as we've always said, an issue, sir, God saved the queen. Uh, that's true. So how are you doing Neil? Great. You having a wonderful life. So far. How about a new sir? I just want doing a survey right now. I'm trying to find out how many radio stations play themselves on hold. Really? Yeah. Okay. Well, let's put you back on hold. You'll all find out. Uh, uh, it's a 744. That's a different word. No, I have no idea who that was. Okay. Thunderlead. Power number one has more information on that Pirate station. Pirate station. Hello. There's an email. I've always thought yes. Oh, wait a minute. Is that you? Yeah. I know all about who that. Now wait a minute. What do you want to slow down a little bit? What are you talking about? You heard what? Well, anyways, you know, Mr. Gray. Now don't start with the accent. Would you please? Oh, I don't know. Wow. That's all right. Believe me. Well, anyways. Okay. The Pirate station. He has like a network of Pirate stations all over the SMBN. Who? Who? What? What? You slow down a little bit? Put the dog. Put the dog. He upper his away and relax him. And then, will you? Okay. I'll do something. I could deep breath. Yeah. Now, the Steven Gray. Yeah. He works at EDR. Oh, geez. And you remember he was a good friend with Willie B. You? Oh, that is natural. I'm going through it. That equals four, right? Well, in their case, yeah. Is that an age? They were on the air the other night. And I don't know how much power they're putting out, but you could pick him up even in a row and in parts of the And he had this guy who claimed to have done things with you on the air. Really? Yes. That's it. It was interesting. And then, believe it or not, Roby Young called in. Oh, boy. This is all tied together now. Yeah, it is now. It's all in. And just in case anybody's listening. Do you know what seed is the Lebanon is? Hmm. If you want to, you know, fix the trends, but it's right on top. It is. Yeah. So, anybody from seed is the Lebanon is listening. The Pirate Station is their trend. Well, if anybody at the FCC is listening, instead of wasting your time waiting for me to say something that I'm not going to say, why don't you get the Pirate Station off the air you heard it? Oh, it's three. There's even a talk one. There's one talk one coming up on 1,600 down on the beach. 1,600? That is going to be a talk show on there. I don't know what to see. I was asked for some tape, but the... Well, in the interest thing thing, is they're all going to show up in the book. That's the best part. I heard they did. Yeah, they're going to beat KAT. I know that. Well, that's the story. And he was talking about chewing. They were doing all sorts of strange stuff on the air. I'm surprised that Paul mentioned that. I have a feeling with the setup, but I don't know if they want me to mention it. The trends were on. He was of Lebanon. I'm sure they did. I think you should plug that a few times because I don't interfere with some other stations. I understand that. 1,917 and 919. Well, if we know who the person is, why do we even have to waste that he's time to look worried about where the transmitter is. Well, the FCC, they've known this is going... This station has been on the air for years. Why aren't they doing something about it? Well, they're busy monitoring. Yeah, they're too busy monitoring me. Waiting for that magical day that's never going to happen. They claim that there's still trying to catch the person that's been interfering with the traffic control of the towers. Yeah. But that's over in the gone with. And I don't know what their problem is. But that station has been on like a long time. And they're mad effect even in tribal casting. And they're in the other stations. Every day they're simultaneously having a feature or a thing on the gondola show. They feature a certain radio station every day in Hanukkah. Oh, terrific. One day they play Risen 98, although they did play Zayt. I've heard a Y100 on there. And they play all that kind of good stuff. Oh. I look. And if anybody's listening for the FCC, he doesn't have Lebanon right on top of the building. He's probably supposed to be high security building too. Yeah, great. Well, obviously kept them out. Obviously. Well, look, have a nice life. And Glenn, I don't know why you've not called Barbeap yet. But that's I'm sure you'll explain that like in the near future. Uh, should I call her? I think I don't, I think you should do it on here. Can I give her a call? Call her out there. Do you want to do this? Sure. Go ahead. Go ahead. Oh, when 12 minutes till late on Zaytah 4?
