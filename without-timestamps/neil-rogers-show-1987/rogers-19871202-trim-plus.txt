Thanks somebody messed with some of the stuff over here. Let me punch a few buttons. How's that now? I didn't do anything. That's what this is. This is what? Hello. This is what the end does, right? Yeah. Comes in here in the punches those buttons. Yeah, they have, they have one to two of those meetings a week. That works really good. You're gonna like, on a one channel? And how about this one? Yeah. See, with this one, you can change channels. I'm gun. I can't hear you. You can't hear me at all. Not my phone. Now I can hear you. But now you can't hear me at all. And that might work like that. That's kind of sexy. Yeah. Okay. It's eight minutes after six on Zeta 4. We might do the weather. Do a little break here. We actually have a couple of breaks this hour. Like what? We're getting back into the swing of things slowly. We don't want to overdo it. All right. We don't have to take a break if you don't want. Okay. Let's skip it. What do we still do the weather? Mostly cloudy today. Uh, high about 72 again today. And low to night, 57. It's 62 degrees now. Okay. You don't have to give the time and do all that other stuff. We're not going into a break. So like loosen up a little bit. Do a little more casually. 62 degrees. Yeah. Feels good outside. Does it really? The cool. Okay. Let's um. We're going to check on me. Let me check this weather out here. Let's see if your temperature is even close. 30% chance of showers today. Oh, look at that. Somebody is somebody's listening and they don't believe your weather. Don't Greg and has him the temperature. Now we want to call him this early in the morning. Just ask the temperature. Just guys your voice. It is 62. It is? Yeah. 30%. Now how did you look in the here? Well, did not prove that it's 62. That's not. I'm just saying that. You know something we don't? It's the final edition. Oh, I see. Okay. That's the good answer. Well, thanks. The levels are this fun. He had me. This tragic. Is this gloves 94? Wait a minute. I thought you wanted to fool him. Pretty early in the morning. Yeah. What's the temperature? Come on, Greg. We can't fool you guys. Can we? You know, we were we just found out that you've been putting us on your air without our permission and you know that's illegal to. Oh, yeah, that's probably against the FCC regulation, right? It is so therefore I'm very sorry. We are not allowed to talk to you. Oh, according. Do you believe that? He hung up. What a jerk. Who? That must be a John Moe. He knows that he's been on the air here. Everything. He ran to his boss and cried to. Oh, my God. I mean, they've been putting on that whole routine for us every day for a week with the cackling and the catching boy boy. Oh, boy. He's been waiting to tell you that for a day. Like he was laughing and all of a sudden. We've been putting them on the air without their knowledge. Who are you kidding? Mr. Mung. Oh, do you believe that? This man. That's brave. It sounds like. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It sounds like a John Moe and who? John Moe and the PD. Remember what we used to call him? I understand. He's the operations manager. Are you going to call all Captain David? He's going to call the warm line. Well, I have enough. Oh, I've been doing it. You can tell around the end of minute. Are you going to tell them around the ear? I can't believe these guys. This is what friends are for. Are you guys kidding or what? That's what we were told. Now come on. Are you guys joking? Are you pulling our legs? And that's not kidding. You're not kidding. I don't can't do it. Somebody over there's upset? Yes. You're not upset, Gloria. No, no, no. Okay, as long as you're not upset, we don't care. Okay, you know, you know better than that. Because we know your management people are more on just like ours. Okay? Am I right? Yeah, I've had some experience with them. Don't forget. Well, we don't want to get into that. I really, I saw bad having to even say that. But I was, you know, given the directive and uh... Wait, why are you talking to me now? We're on the air. Come on, Greg. Fight for your rights. Don't be a whimp. Don't just whimp out and roll over and play. Come on, baby. Donald, you're going to have to give us a... Don't do it, Donald. Don't do it. Oh, sorry, we can't play anymore. There's a whole lot of... Hey, Donald. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. I do it! I do it! He did it! I knew he had it in him. I knew he had it. Gee, I don't want to touch that line with a gentleman. Oh, oh. Okay, boys and girls is 13 past six on Zeta4. I just, uh, can you believe that last conversation? Now that was, uh, I'm an emotional wreck. Now I would say that Mr. Mr. Moron, their P.D. is going to have that, that warmline change. You think so? Yeah. Because from one lousy call, I bet. Well, you're still fine out what it is. Oh, yeah. That's been, uh, that's been their warmline for about two years. Oh, good. And the tears you call, I bet they'll change it. Don't you think so? The warmline. Yeah. In other words, like a hotline, but not so hot. Like their numbers. It's kind of a privilege for that station. They're not that hotline. They have a warmline. Yeah. And after the next book comes out, they're going to call it the loop. The loop warmline. Oh, jeez. Oh, jeez. We need a little less respect from all of us. And now, here with a special Christmas message, the immortal Elvis. Although he, like everybody, is here his scheme. I don't know how to build around with for a while, but I want you all to know what up here in Rockerville, although I think it'll be a Christmas. And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message. I'd like to do a piece like, uh, come out a little, please let our high-gown bond. Thank you. I know a lot. Block whole sun. Christmas is a time of hope. Time of joy. We're turning for love and I'm sure we're love. Thanks last night, Peter, you got there. I can't. But we're more like, no more love. Oh yeah, Christmas. And Christmas to me means family. And family means friends. And friends means getting together. And getting together means, eat. I'll pass me that thumbs-take, which is what you call it, like it's a very, very much. And I'll just move to the lady right now. You know, I may be a big star, maybe too bad. But ain't nobody still better, because you can't reach out a helping hand. I don't know, helping hand. Oh, yeah, hand may help with those match-staters over there, which I believe, like it, like very much. Now I will explain them. Ain't nobody still big, you can't. Stoop to help a friend and need over the holiday season. A speaking of season. You won't pass me that thumbs-saker, and you get the chance, like it. Yeah, just, just don't screw the cover, that's right. Like, I don't know. So this Christmas, why don't you all take it to you for mold, A.O. Now, I'll leave those, stay to your fried-worthy art. You know what I mean? I appreciate it, thank you. I want you to remember, for all part of God's great big family, and you know God made man into his own image. And looking at the mirror, I have to say God must be, I'm big, big, soon of we're gonna get a little mean. I like it, dude. But I especially want you all to remember this one last thing. And you're all of whom is Christmas, stringing that popcorn up on the tree, save a big, big bowl for the can, extra butter, or my, like it is. Like it, like it, like it, or my. Meal with a spoon. With a smile, yeah. Drink my coffee, punchin' on my donut. With two four-way-dod. Get ready to go to school with me. With two four-on-a-dile. Do it if you're too working my walls, but the dole, you know. With two four-on-a-dile. Ooh, we're the... Meal, meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal. Meal. Meal, meal. Meal, meal. Meal. Meal. Meal. Meal. All right. Six, six, eight, on Zeta4. And I wonder about that. And it's too bad somebody doesn't have a key to this room, because that Elvis thing that we just played, the Christmas message from Elvis. I bet you that would be big on AM, don't you think so? Why do you think that? Yeah. Of course, we don't have time to play, because we don't play music. We just talk about it a lot. And that should be our poll today. Do we talk too much about music? I like yesterday, and I'm really did we not talk about music. We hardly play it any. Water, too. Maybe a couple of songs, and that was it. A whole four hours. And then, of course, we played our usual eight minute cut to go home by it. That's the longest cut you could find. No. Good and finding, longer. I was close. Anyway, let's give those numbers out, because I bet you we got a lot of people in the audience who have something to say today. And like that show I heard yesterday, or do you have to know on the AM? No, what do you think to say? Wow, what a show that was. Do you like the guy I really enjoyed? I don't know what he's doing. And then he goes out about how we have no competition. I mean, who the hell is he kidding? He's got Alice and Steve O'Neill and that's his that's all his competition. Nothing else. Look at his guy. We've got Tanner and we've got Sunny Fox and we've got our two good friends who just said goodbye by the way. We got them. And we got, uh, Rick and Spuds and we got Herman and McQueen. And she's good. Enjoy the show. That's pretty stiff. And you're a pinto. Here you're talking yesterday again about how the show is different. Oh, yeah. It sounds different on that. And that's another question in our poll today is the show different on FM that it was on AM. You know, we've been through this a million times, but we've just got to get it out of our system is for good old you know who. Yeah. What is his story anyway? He's getting really like, sirly and hostile. Maybe he sees the hand writing on the wall. Oh. You think that's possible? Six to 0 3600. They'd seven seven nine 3600 and Broward and we want to know where the how the mobile colors are too. So we can say. We've had a minimal number of mobile colors ever since we started over here. There's something to arrange about that. Out of the desire. Well, we'll fight out, right? Dave County. Good morning. Hi. This is Abram. Again. Oh, yeah. You're getting to be a chronic regular Abram. Yeah. Well, I've run. You know, I used to listen to you on the AM. I just, I don't know. I just liked it better. It, you played more of the joke songs and I don't know. I just liked it better. But anyway, and for this thing, now you know, I have my way to it. Wait a minute. Let me ask you a question. How old are you? 14. Would you like to get to 15? Well, I don't know, Neil. I don't know. It's, it's still a really good show. And I listen all the time. But it's not as good, right? And I don't know. I, this tell would be very popular in my house. I don't know. I can't listen to it. I'm glad because I couldn't listen to it because I'm at school during that. But in the afternoon, I'm at school. No, you know, I used to listen to it during the summer. You have to know. But now that it's on in the morning, I can listen to it during that. Ray, that's excellent. I'm so happy. Even if you don't like it. I know. That's good. Okay. So I was really happy. But, you know, I have my radio on there. No, I don't. He's saying that the show is different in the morning. Aren't you? And now what you're saying? I don't know what he's saying. He's like battling a whole bunch of people. Oh, it is different. I'm feeling weird. So he says, it's not different. It's the same show. Okay? It's the same show. And he's on FM. And we play a little bit more music. And some, once in a great while, we play a lot of music. But very, really. It's the same show, okay? Come on. I've wrong. Let's get with it. Okay? Okay. Better be nice. It will change your last name to lip shots. Okay. So there's no time to lip shots. You know what I mean? No time to lip shots. This is the big, composing. Oh, I see. No time to lip shots. Sorry. Yeah. Have a nice day of run. You, you know, you say goodbye, I've wrong. Hey. Say goodbye. Say goodbye. Really? Really?

I rate viewers protesting the preemption of Alph to run an interview with Soviet Premier Gorbachev. Yeah, some nerve they got. Don't they? And you believe that an exclusive interview with a Soviet leader. In the 15 city overnight ratings, Tom Brokals, much valleyhood interview with Gorbachev, pulled only a 13 share of the audience and placed third. Now, in its time period, it lost out to ABC's the ultimate stuntman, a tribute to Dar Robinson and CBS's Kate Nalley and Frank's place.

And just the show in the morning is just as good as it after one. Of course it is. All these people, you know, it becomes like fashionable to talk about how they show is different.

Oh, there's nothing on it. But it is printing. I was trying to answer your question. You asked me a question. How about if I just do the show in the park? I'll just talk about the background. Like Captain Dave. Come on. We off mic the rest of the show. Ask me a question. What was I starting to say before I was so rudely interrupted? What was it? I don't even remember now. Something like, no, it was something very important. Like somebody came in here and messed with this mic again. And if you can't hear it, then you must be brain dead. I'm saying it doesn't sound as good. It sounds hollow and tinny. And like there's something like it's turned around or something. There's something wrong with this. Cheese. I mean, just wouldn't it be nice if two days in a row things could sound the same in here? Well, what the hell is wrong? I'm telling you that goofball engineer was in here. Guaranteed. I'm telling you. He was in here. I can feel it. You may be right. Boy, okay, let's take one from the Broward County. There's something wrong with this. It sounds like crap. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. Now you sound okay. Yeah, I live up here in court for you to have the melting pot. Really? Yeah. All right. What way do you live behind the melting pot? Do you mean like not in a house? No, the apartment's behind it. Oh, I see. I think you met like maybe in a little tent. Yeah. Okay. Listen. I work at a grocery store up here. Alberts and so on. Yeah.

No. I can't be safe as a host or something. I don't know. And that's a good idea. You know, I mean, because I just can't handle it. All these bags. Mm-hmm. And I just want to know what to do or you're thinking with the melting pot. I must have not been listening today. You explain it. What do you mean what's my deal? Well, it's a sponsor. It's a sponsor. It's a sponsor. Awesome. What's the big deal? Well, there are no big deal.

You see what I'm looking? No. No, it's the old. I guess I'm not being so clear. I'm not talking about happy customers. I'm talking about gay customers. I'm talking about a special kind of men's story. A story from men who like to be with other men. Men better than men. Sure. Oh, no. You're not talking a story. Oh, talking a men's club. Oh. You're talking something like what? The Kivana is there. It's been a bit of a men's club. That's the issue. I like it. I like it. You can sell clothes and take clothes.

Should I call them one more time and say you're on the air? I mean, that was the complaint. Right? You didn't tell them they were on the air. There's so. Did you notice though when we called back? It was obvious that that was such garbage. Oh, it's from there. It is. He worked. Came down from up above from John moron. The word came down. I can't say what we used to call.

So it is running on other stations. Yes. I thought you like Channel 33. That's correct. That's pretty exciting. It was about. That means we might have some people listening today who have no idea what the show is on it. That's correct. Like the regular listeners. Okay. We have an open line in a Broward at 7 7 9 3600. Two lines in day. We're just going to forget the music today. Okay. Let's just cut out all the music and see if that passifies it. Now that'll break my heart. It will. Yeah. I like the music. You have about. I got a whole bunch of CDs. I wouldn't say 15 more like about 8. Mr. Monch. A bunch of CDs. I'm going to play some stuff. But the audience doesn't want the music. And that top one looks like you're going to play like your all time favorite beetle record. Oh, was I? Were you? Well, I'll tell you which one I was going to play. And it's not my all time favorite beetle record. I'm looking through you. Oh, I heard that a lot. What do you think I was going to play drive my car? Uh-huh. That's not my favorite beetle record.

See, we got a real problem here now. We have a very serious problem. Guns are pulled out of here yesterday and it's nowhere to be found because you're going to get back in here. So it's got to be somewhere in there with his crap. Mm-hmm. Places just, it's impossible. That's right. He did play it. And here's Perry come on with its impossible on Zeta 4, part of our new format. Why is he playing? If two open lines and Dave by the way, did I say that? I'm going to go. You brain dead morons? I thought I said that. 620, 3600. See, one thing about this group in the morning. They have no opinions about anything. If you notice that, they have no opinion about anything. They call, but they have no opinions. No matter what the question is, they have no answer. Or are you people something else that I'll tell you? Where are we going to a Broward County? Hello? Hello. How are you doing this morning? Okay. I can't I'll give you an opinion. I didn't hear your show ever on a AM. Really? I really have nothing to compare to. I see. I see people, I mean, news people, newspaper clippings. I came talk this morning. Don't ask me why I'm calling because I can't talk. Okay. I just want to tell you that what I hear on that family to bed, you're doing okay. Oh, okay. Isn't to bed. You have any other people you could call up and go on the radio? No. I'd tell you, you're not going to call him. I wouldn't dignify you by making the call, okay? Okay. And I wanted to ask what they, how come now when I listen to you on hold? It's, it's staying for the same with the radio. Uh-oh. It does? Uh-huh. I don't understand. Why would you hear, uh, air on hold? You have to be as opposed to hear pre-delegant hold. I know. Well, you know why? You know why? Because we're not in delay. Oh, well, good. I'm glad you're not in delay today. We're not in delay. I just looked over there. The delay's not working. You maniac in there. What do you mean what happened? Do you never punched it off? Yes, I did. No, you, well, we got out of it. We're out of it. I'm glad you called you. You just saved the life. Remember it's six o'clock. Okay. You could have played one Harry Chaypin song today for me one. We'll try. Okay. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. It's time. Well, I'm switching power off and on and it's gone. Well, it's probably the fuse, okay? Well, let me, let me give my screwdriver out and not check this out. Oh, geez. Do you believe this? What? Every day on this radio station, you get a new load for technical or is it new highs for technical and competence? Hmm. It's dead. He says. I don't like that. How about the fuse captain? Okay. He's here's a little play by play ladies and gentlemen. On the $80 billion Zeta digital delay. Captain Dave is pulling the cord out of the wall first. That's always good. We don't want you to get a shock. Pulling the cord out. Now he's tying the cord. Oh, geez. I can't tell you. Now where's the fuse? There ought to be a little fuse in about what else could it possibly be that the power just like it disappeared? What was it? I think today you ought to just talk to nice people. Oh, shit. You know, I'm going to tell you something. This new engineer, we're going to have to hire a hitman. I think you're something. What the hell is his story? Okay. Wait. Wait. I turned it on. None of the lights come on, but I feel a vibration. Oh, you feel it. Yeah. See, it's off. No vibration. There's a vibration. Oh, I see. So it's doing something. But there's no lights or anything on. I think, basically, the transformers coming on. But it's not going into the icy circuits. Oh. The what? Remember Van Lingo, Mongo. Twenty before seven on Zeta 4. I apologize, but I don't know. Should we take some more calls? I don't think so. It scares me. No, I don't think so. See, I didn't have to say that. But once you brought that up, it was pretty obvious that we were not in delay. Mm-hmm. So like I said, we're going to add a lot of music to the show today. We're going to play. Yes, it is. See, no, that is one thing that's different from the AM show. And that is that even with all their problems up there in the RF, at least most of the time, we were on the year. Yeah. There was when 10 o'clock six came after CBS news. I had a pretty good idea that when I opened my mic, I would be on the air and that the show would be on in its entirety. And there wouldn't be all of these idiotic problems that the lay were. But generally speaking, this is a disaster area up here in this part of the building. It's an unmitigated disaster. And of course, when you're operating with management that's brain dead from the neck up, you know, request for the New Year Rogers disease. That's got to hopefully had a lot of requests. Because, well, I've grown was right. We don't play enough bits on FM. And we've got like thousands of them that we're going to play today. Gillian's of them. Some of me even brand new. There he is. He's diddling with the delay again. He's in the back of it with a screwdriver. Diddling. Yeah. And he's just like poking. You know what I mean? He's like poking stuff around with a screwdriver. Not really doing anything useful. To watch him is to be totally confounded and confused. And be Wilder ladies and gentlemen, I cannot believe some of the things that he's doing to that machine. It's a 642 on Zeta. What the hell do we do now? You know, I just feel like we had a little momentum going and we were taking a lot of calls. And now I feel like all of a sudden as usual, the show is in limbo. Well, we do the limbo rock. Yeah. Yeah. And of course, if I wanted to play a CD, we couldn't do that because he's in there diddling with the digital delay. You weren't going to play any anyway. What? Well, we're going to have to now. Are you out of your mind? We don't have to, but I'm not going to sit here in squawk for four hours. No? No. You don't play yes it is, but... All the Beatles? But we have that in there somewhere. How could you not know yes it is? I think I remember it. Oh, gee. I believe I remember it from the other side of ticket to ride you idiot. Well, that was a big hit. So as yes it is, they were both in the top... Where is it? I don't believe you. Oh, I do remember the record though now. But I'm not major major's going to come on today and say, Oh, there he was going. Show everybody how much he knows about music again. Mm-hmm. Now, I didn't remember it at first. It's been a long time since I heard him by talking about their work. But I think I do know what you're talking about. How you could be sitting there saying those things with the straight face. Just boggles my mind, okay? Okay, let's hear it. Number 9. Number 9. Tangery. Okay, where's ticket to ride? Ticket to ride? Where is yes it is? Uh-huh. There's on her rigby. Mm-hmm. How can this be possible? Mm-hmm. It never made. Now what are these? What are the ones that are in here? The top 35, top 40? I don't know. Not possible. Mm-hmm. Is that right? Well, all I said was it was a great record. The weather had made the top 100. Now, nothing. A minute ago, you said it was as big a hit as ticket to ride. No, I didn't say as big. You said it with it. Well, it was as big. It was seven inches across. It was on the same 45. Well, you didn't get specific. Oh, I see. Now, is that Pacific enough for you? So, another word. It was not a hit. He's still diddling. It was the digital delay. It was not a hit. Right? And my cry house it was. Okay. What are you doing back there? Are you going to find that record for us? You're going to just diddle all day. Oh, God. Is this a radio show or is this some kind of a joke? And is Mike Ketchew here that? I mean, you're looking me like a mod of my mind. It's so titty. It sounds like I'm in a time tunnel. You're looking me like a mod of my mind. It's so titty. It sounds like I'm in a time tunnel. You can't hear the difference? Yeah. No, I can't. Oh, no. You can and he can. Not in here. Sounds jay. It sounds. It sounds jake to me. Jake? All right. Now, do we have yesterday's by the Beatles? I can look at that. Please. Have you something constructive? Would you please? Is that it just standing there like a moron? Do something useful? Oh, God. Is he frustrating or what? Now, it sounds better now because I turned the my head sets down. But that didn't accomplish anything. All that means is I can't hear all the distortion. It's not to say. Couldn't they go out and get a real engineering here just for a couple of days? And whatever happened to that Richard Van Schnuck by the way, have you seen him? Haven't seen him. He hasn't come anywhere near this part of the building. He must listen to the show. Oh, I see. Six forty five on Zeta four. We apologize as usual. I don't know why I'm apologizing because I have nothing to do with it. I didn't touch the delay. I didn't do anything. I just showed up this morning as usual. That was my first mistake. That'll be. Then we talked to Avroom that was really something. He misses the time tunnel. Yeah. Well, I'm going to take some calls. I don't give a damn whether it's on the layer not. Okay. Date County. Hello. Yeah. Stand right about you in that music. Oh, yeah. I also want other opinions. Do you want to hear him? Yeah. It shows not as good. It's not as good. You know why? Why is that? Don't hang up on cars anymore. How are you? I'm up on him. No kidding. Six forty six on Zeta four. Is that in other words, is that what? What? I don't see anything. Oh, come on. How could it not be in here? Is this a radio station or what? Wait. There's a note on the back of this one. Because of lack of interest. Yes, it is. Oh, stop. What would you please? But I do. I do. I do. But I do. I do. I do. But I do know what you talk. I do know the right. No, you don't. Yes, I do. And he's going. He says it goes. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. What the hell does that mean? What does that mean? You idiot. At the end of the chorus. It goes. Yes, it is. You're not the way you're singing. And I mean, you're not even in the ballpark. I know what you're talking about. It sounds more like one fine day by the chef. Fonsor is something. I'm hanging around with Ringo Star stealing the chef. Fons music. Six forty six. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I'm talking about music again. I apologize. We can't be music. Mavans like those people who play Brian Ferrie and smoke. It's in your eyes every day and lady and red. I mean, if I hear lady and red one more time, Stan, it's all over. Okay. Let's just plot a long and pretend we know what we're doing here. Okay. Broward County. Hello. He's complaint Wednesday, Neil. Yeah, what do you want? Uh, I want to complain about your home show. Okay. Call the guy wanted us to talk about the show. Okay. Call the guy wanted us to hang up on people, right? Yeah. He's got it. Now, these are complaints from people who are obviously, obviously listening to show. He's actually this last kid who sounded really wide awake to me, didn't he? Oh, it's not the same, but he's not the same. Well, I'm telling you, some of you people, if they were handing out this count on the bottom, he's been standing online for six months, okay? And deservedly so. They'd count. Hello. Hi, how are you? Great. I totally disagree with your last two callers. I think your show is superior to when you were on am. I don't care. Hang on up on you. Oh, my god. They want me to hang up on people. That's what they want. That's why they listen to the show. They don't listen because they like me. They just want to hear somebody be rude on the radio. But he was tinkling on. I don't care. Okay. All right. Now what did Captain Dave accomplish here this morning? Didn't find yesterday's. He has no idea what happened to the digital delay. And this place is turning into a parking lot rapidly. Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children, a summer home in Opa Laca, and a chain of radio stations. Well, normal that isn't till just three weeks ago. Hi, honey. How was your day? Un... believable. Terminal! There's nothing but subhuman douchebags out there. Alan Box is suffering from... Neal Rogers disease. Have you canceled the Miami Heraldia? But honey, we don't subscribe to the Heraldia. Oh, no. That's a cop-out. What kind of a lame excuse is that? Just say no to El Heralds, sir. Huh? People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings. What's the matter with you? Blue Herald bags from femoral pines. You know, the infants who say... All kneel. How can you say those nasty things? Running around stealing sweet and low. Can I get you anything? How about those bag boys at Windixie? You know, it doesn't hurt to look. In... credible. Neal Rogers disease. A growing South Florida epidemic. Please help us find a cure. Honey, it's Friday night. You know what that means? Hey, you know what? I got a night. A night! What's the father got? Three points on things? Send your tax deductible contributions today. In Caribote 105. Terminal. Unbelivable. It's $6.49 already. It's $6.50 to me. I'm a clock in the control room. But again, you know, I could be... I'm always close. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the Olsen's are out today. And for the first time since July 85, the cause be show finished out of the top 10 in BC attributes, Cosby's 12th place rating to low viewership on Thanksgiving night. And 60 minutes was number one for the first time since December 86. In fact, CBS saw its Sunday night line up virtually replace in BC's Thursday night line up at the top. Murder she wrote was number two. And a movie called The Long Journey Home was number four. And by the way, Yes. What? Dan Rath? What do we do it again? No. Dan Rather came in number one in the evening news. Great. Good old Dan. What's the frequency, Kenneth? And now this will enter. Finally something that will interest you. I finally found something. You're interested in. One event. Foxes 21 Jump Street. Oh yeah. I'm interested in Big Time in that show. Tied. It's highest ever national rating Sunday. It had a 6.1 attention share. And it, uh, Dr. Joe. Tied the lowest rated network show, which was the Charmings. But that was good for Fox. And Jump Street's high ratings. And the all important team female demographic was very good this. Oh, but you know, I wonder why they were watching. Ah, probably the same reason that I was watching. Are we going to get an engineering here this morning or what? Because I'm not going to sit here all the way till 10 o'clock with the delay not working. Sitting on pins and needles. Are we going to do something about this? Or are we just going to sit here like we're brain dead? You don't like living dangerously like that? I don't like not having anything working on this show. Okay. In other words, I'm getting to the point where I'm getting just a little bit tired. I see. You know what I'm saying? Like a little pissed off that here we are like after 8 or 9 weeks, whatever now it's been. And we still can't make this place work. Okay. Okay. You understand what I'm saying? Yes, I do. I don't want to get emotional, but, uh, getting a little little second tired of this Mickey Mouse jury rig piece of garbage. Okay. Jerry rig. Jerry rig. Okay. As in 12 angry men, mostly crowded by the way with Henry Fonda and mostly cloudy 30% chance of rain today with a high about 72, low to night 57. And my bridges 60. No, he wasn't in that. No. 62 degrees. As Zeta 4. 6. 52. Okay. 6. 54. And while you listen to Steve Wood, when I'm going to think about getting back into the business. So I'm talking about. There must be a chronic callers. We're going to do whatever the hell we want to do here, you know? Or do you knew that? Oh, okay. I thought that was like a major bulletin. But really? Seven of the clock I'd say before the big news is of course. Wait a minute, did you hear that? Wow. What a noise on that cart. I didn't dub it by the way. That was already here when I came here. I didn't dub it either. A lot of noisy scratchy crap on FM and this market. I was listening. I was playing something yesterday. And it was a scratchy. Now wait a minute. If you can't hear that echo. Did you hear that? That's heard. What the hell is that all about? I don't have the headphones up loud. What is going on here? I sound like I'm a swimming in a time tunnel or something. And they, oh, we don't hear anything. Was that the CBS bomb? How about some cotton swabs or something to clean you guys ears out? I heard this. These engineers are morons. You know what? And we got two of them on the way in here now. They are. Yes. He says we have two engineers coming in. Then he tells me who it is. And I say, that's not even one. I mean Richard Vegas and I is kid, but he's an engineer like I'm a brain surgeon. Okay. And then is this who's the other one it's coming? Are there new engineers? Oh no. God help us. Are you serious? Oh, gee. Don't let him in the door. Tell me. Tell me is it the wrong place. Send him over to gloves. Don't let him in here. I'm telling you at least at least we're on the air. That's something. Not a bunch, but at least that's a start. Every day, every damn day, every God, damn day. It's something new in this place. You know what I'm saying? This isn't how the song by Bobby Gold. It sure is. And it's coming up in five minutes on Zeta 4 as part of our 18,000 in a row. Is part of our block head. I mean, this is this is not acceptable. Don't don't they understand. This is not the way you do a radio show. Like Dr. Frankenstein's laboratory. We come in every day and we have no poor couple of potions. Is it going to work? Will we be on? And then this maniac over here. I start talking and I'm never on. He's never even on the days when this works. This board is never on. You know, and I just keep are we on? We on yet. Go ahead, do the ID of us. And then we have a big musical surprise for you, by the way. It's no delay Wednesday on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale of the Palm Beach The Neil Rogers Show with Neil Glenn the Bird Hill and Captain Day. And Patty Murray. Okay. I'll see. Stan Major's just jealous. He just upset because he can't do that. He can't do it. He couldn't do that if his life depended upon it. If they threatened to take four of those stokees and put them where the moon don't shine, he still couldn't do it. And don't I'm saying? Pretty warm. Okay. I rest my case. I mean, it may not be a great show, but at least I can do it. Talk up. Okay. At least I can hit the split queue. I love. Or as Captain Day would say the post. He's been watching Tony hockey game. They hit the post in a hockey game, not on a record. Don't you enjoy Stan's talk ups, though? Oh, yeah. I really enjoy him because you never know where they're going when he's going to stop talking. I mean, it had on some great either now. It has nothing to do with it. It's not a little bit hollow, but not quite like I do. But Stan's talk ups have nothing whatsoever to do with when they guys start singing. All right. Now we have a musical surprise coming up in a moment. But first. You're not really sure. You're not really sure. You're not really sure. So fun. Don't take it away. Close your hand. It's not just so surprise. It's a surprise with me. I'm afraid it can't be up right. Who said no, it's not the same. You said no, it's not the same. I'm really, really, really. But if you're doing okay, you're doing okay. I'm feeling all of him move. Six with him bow. Feeling all of him bow. Be bold. I'm much as a trustee move. I'm much as a trustee move. From a dialer ice, there's a half of him bow. She's spent the night on her coat. Go and some gold and ship bow. Come on and take your visit, your fools around. He wins the race. He wins the race. Now you're wearing no excuses. Now you've got no excuses. You've got no class. You've got no shame. Lots of fame. Be bold, be bold. Hard in the bow. Be bold, be bold. Be bold. Be bold. Be bold. There's a list of the greats. Who's that? Well, it's Rita. And Rita, Rita, Jen, Red. We love you. It's on the island mass, here's sweetheart. We're top of the hospital, and we're really. And who's that over there? And as you go on, we go on. We go on. We go on. We look so pretty, so you have to keep praying. And then you'll sign the green Mars. And you want to be a TV news reporter. We're a good, really qualified. We're going to spread the news going. And he's out over there. It's grand enough. And why are you on the way to do another match? It's commercial. That's great. I love your autobiography. Good for the town. Oh, and I love that playboy lingerie. Yeah, okay. See you around. You're off to a door, another line of women's clothing. Good. Good. Make the money while you can. Good. See you, Vanna. Boy boy. Okay, 706 on Zeta 4. Now that wasn't bad. That was good. Did you think I was pretty cute? Yeah. Sounded new. And it was new. We haven't played that before. I know that's frightening. Maybe Dennis Collins is monitoring today. And since we had a big meeting yesterday, we ought to say a special Zeta 4 hello to buddy nevens. At the slum Sentinel, you idiot, you douchebag, you moron. With all these wonderful, he's the only guy in America who's written 75 stories about a non-story about something that's not happening. The investigation of the neorodger show and all is in decent broadcasting and smut. And mong. He can't give you any examples because he doesn't know of any, but the man is dangerous, okay? An absolute total idiot. In fact, I always thought my mother told me when I was a kid that nobody was perfect, but buddy nevens disproves that he's a perfect idiot. A perfect jackass, okay? I just wonder where he came from. Why are you dribbling again? Where he came from? Hunger. Can I dribbling? The FCC is investigating the neorodger show. Investigating what? We can't even get the damn delay to work on their investigating the show. They should investigate the engineer. Exactly. Now we're talking now. You're coming up with a good idea. Let's have an FCC investigation of this engineering department. Where did these guys get their license high and a cracker jacks box no less? What do what mail order school is new engineer came from, huh? From the hard knocks school of engineering in Knoxville, Tennessee, no doubt. Boy, these guys are frightening. Nothing works in this place. And it's interesting that I saw that telltale sign. You see, they thought I would come in and believe because the door was still like the nobody had been in here. They were in here, tinkering again. Because the cassette function button right there. That's the evidence. I feel like Perry Mason. Or Marsha Mason. Yeah. Or Dolly Madison. Anyway, he just, they just can't leave this room alone. You know, as of yesterday, everything was fine again. There were no problems. Now the mic is all tinny and watery and running. In fact, look at that. It's running. Looks like it's got some kind of a STD. Seriously, it looks like it's got herpes or something. It's like dripping and running or gonorrhea. I just wish someone could tell me what the attraction. Yeah. What is there in this room that you can't keep your paws off? What is it? What is in here that they have to come in here? Boy, it's like number one priority is they have to have access to this room. It's the most important thing in this place. They can't live without it. They can't function. Okay, now do we have a break to do now? Oh, yeah, we better. We better check on the temperature. We did it on the temperature. It's 63. Would you check in the library? I went to, hey, I'm a check on the temp. And it's 63. You want to vent? I checked it. I went over at 7 o'clock and checked it. Mostly cloudy today. There'll be a 30% chance of rain. High about 72. Look at it. About 57. And it is 63 degrees. I'd say to four. It's 709. Where does a used car deal get used cars? Maybe at a used car auction. The collection doesn't rely on auctions. We get about 500 customer trade-ins every month. Fantastic cars. Pre-owned volvos, BMWs and Porsche's. Pre-owned Toyota's. Nissan's and Honda's. Pre-owned Chevy's, old-smobile's and Ford's. How does the collection sell so many trades? Quite simply. Price. The collection has discounted use car centers at every showroom. Bird Road in US-1. Southwest 158 street in US-1. 9200 Northwest 27th Avenue. PS. The collection doesn't keep every trade. We keep the best and wholesale the rest. Where? At those used car auctions. Why buy from a used car dealer? You can get a pre-owned car from the collection. Deal Rogers. The Rock and Roll Monster. 10 past seven on Z4. We apologize profusely and we certainly want to thank you for your indulgence. And if you believe that. There's that tone again. You can't hear that? Say, yeah, my dear. Oh, geez. You know this. You engineers. We're going to take you and hang each one of you from a separate tower. But better, fact, from the same tower. We wouldn't even waste the rope. You know what the tone is. What is it? Because I hear it sometimes when you get through playing a bit. Yeah. It's the Q-tone returning to the beginning of the cart. That is what it is. Oh, wait a minute. All right, hold on. Deal Rogers. The Rock and Roll Monster. Okay, listen. You believe that? How can that be on the air? Ladies and gentlemen. You're right. We have to have an FCC investigation into the engineering department here at the WI and ZWZTA. Immediately if not sooner. How can that go on the air? Does it do it on all of them? On every cart of them. Especially when you talk after him. You can hear it. Well, what am I supposed to do? Do you leave dead air? What do you mean after I talk after? I mean, when there's no use going in a music. Yeah. On most of them it does. Yeah. Great. But I never wanted to tell you. Good. Okay, boys and girls. Welcome to a make believe radio station. All right. It's 12 past seven on Zeta 4 and I have no idea what you know, what the show is all about today. Okay. Nothing to do with this. I totally disavow any responsibility for anything that goes on here today. Unless something comes up good. We have a little musical surprise if you got it. Cute up now. I want you to listen carefully to this and maybe your brain will do something. You were ready tonight. Remember what I said tonight. For it is the color that my baby want. And what's more is true. Yes, it is. Scott, where the clothes she wore. Everybody knows and show. I would remember all the things we planned. I understand it's true. Yes, it is it's true. Yes, it is. I could be happy with you by my side. If I could forget her, but I'm running against it. Yes, it is. Yes. Yes. Please don't worry. I would say, it's the way to pray. So if I could forget my baby, I'm running against it. I will remember all the things we planned. You were ready to go. This is what I said tonight. This is what I said tonight. For it is the color that will make me blue. In spite of you is true. With you by my side If I could forget her But it's alright, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes Please don't worry, tonight This is what I said tonight For as is the color that will make me blue It's by the view it's true Yes, it is it's true Yes, it is it's true I especially like the scratches in that copy of it And the record is so worn out that the S's are all real civilint did you notice that? You mean cuts has been played so much? Yes, it is. What you're saying? Yes, it is. I like that though. But is it an at a great record? Oh, yeah. How could you deny that that's a fit that that's one of my favorite beatle records Whether it was a hit or not is not even worth any hits? It's like I'm a man by Chicago. Oh, did I say that? Can we play that? No, no changes. No changes. I remember that. What? Yes, it is. But it's a fantastic. It's just beautiful record. The first things they ever did. The harmonies are incredible. It's just a wonderful record. Just when you first set it, it didn't click in my brain. Yeah, if I would have said yes it is. You had to relate it in a lot of words. Like those kids at Teravila High in Coral Square wherever the hell it is. I noticed we didn't have anybody from that the lame school calling this morning. Of course, we haven't taken many calls. Savoy. Well, you think there might be a reason for that? You don't want to take your life in your hand? No. Okay. Good. Right if you like. I like the RF. Do you like that? Yeah. Who said it's Ron Harrison, ladies and gentlemen, what we ought to do is start identifying the players. So when you hear all that RF bleeding through, I mean, these engineers here, I'm telling you. They are just morons. What do you think they do? Well, that's not. I don't have any idea. They just tinker as in tinkerbell. They just come in and they tinker around with crap and they mess it all up and they give us heartburn and they're just hopeless. There are a bunch of morons. Of course, the audience thinks, well, well, everybody's a moron. I got news for you. Okay. Trust me on this one. They're not just like regular ordinary everyday morons. They're like some kind of special morons. And a class by themselves. Because I flip around the dial and I listen to other stations occasionally. And I don't hear at them having problems getting on the air or doing anything that you will do during the normal course of a radio show. I don't hear that. Now speaking of that, that reminds me about you were talking about Howard Stern. Well, the other day, how he doesn't have any problems. Oh, I'm going to call you. And we're supposed to call him this morning. Oh, he aren't. So I'll be by calling us. All right. We can call how he. All right. We had a question to ask him. Remember? Okay. What was that kid's name? Was it Mitch? Mitch? What was Mitch? Mitch? 717. What? Why are you talking? He's gave the time. Oh, I see. That's how that was the number. This is the morning. 17 after 7. Infinity Broadcasting? I wonder why they answer the phone like that. Now you're trusting you can talk to him without delay. Oh, yeah. I wouldn't talk to Howard without delay. I'll tell you that. No. But we can talk to Mitch. We're not. Infinity Broadcasting. Yeah, Mitch. Yeah. Yeah. This is Neil Rogers. And Miami. Remember we talked yesterday? Yeah. How are you doing? I'm with you friend to last all time. On here. See Howard won't put Mitch on here. So we've got to. Now listen, there are all kinds of rumors. What are you shut up? There are all kinds of rumors going around about Howard show that he's going to be on the satellite. The two minutes satellite. He is? Uh, no. I never heard anything about that. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Uh, we figured it was probably a lie, you know? Yeah. Like starting December 21st. I mean, these people who make these lies up. They even had like a start date and stuff like that. No. No chances are there's no satellite. Oh, I see. So in other words, Howard's not going to be on the air and all these 18 other markets that allegedly he was going to be on in six. Not that I know of. Not that Howard knows of either, right? And what happened with that, uh, I hate to mention a delicate thing. But because we really like Howard a lot, I hate to admit it, but we do. And, uh, whatever happened to the fox show. What happened to the fox show? Yeah. Well, geez, I don't know. You know, that's, that's, uh, apparently, uh, dead in the water. You know, in the water. Did you watch him on the lake show? No, I've got it on tape. Somebody sent it to me. I didn't see it, but I haven't on. Oh, I saw that. Did you see it? Yeah. Yeah. You liked it. I know. I mentioned your name to Howard just on the air. And he doesn't like you guys. Oh, really? Why not? Well, no. He just doesn't like you. What? Well, I don't know. No special reason. All right. He just got on his nerves. Oh, okay. Well, that's all right. We enjoy getting on Howard's nerves. Yeah. So I don't understand something though. He might need us someday. In order to say, it's not very likely, but somebody when he's really desperate, you know? But don't you think it's sort of pathetic that you guys have to call our show? And then we have our own show here. We don't have to call the people shows. You don't have to call other people shows. I mean, you call Howard calls like Jessica. Jessica Han for crying out loud. I mean, that's pretty desperate. Let's see. It's just a cheap hooker. You know, anybody can do that. We can go down to Biscayne in 79 street here and get a cheap hooker and put her on the air. No, no, listen to me. Yes, Matt. Show. We're getting serious. I'm sorry. Don't you think it's sort of weird that you guys have to call our show from material. I mean, that's a bit of a way to make it calling your show from material. What material are you giving us, Mitch? What I'm a way to make it. Can that be felt? What material are is Howard giving us? I mean, let's get serious. You know, you know, what? Get real, Neil. Come on, Mitch. What's your up, little, will you please? What's that? I said, the guest series. What I'm saying, Neil, is this? What we were talking about on the air, yes, we talked about your show. Oh, you did. How are you, did? Yeah, we are told in the at your call. Yeah, he doesn't even know who I am. He knows the name. Oh, he knows the name. He was told about it by someone. Yeah, by probably by Grandpa, L Lewis told him. Yeah, come on. Let me say. And the question that we have that we came up is, is Howard does four hours of his own show. Yeah, and I do four hours of my own show. How do you like that? I know it's a miracle. I can just of calling us. So, I mean, in the sort of my show, can just of calling you by Mitch. Call him one time. Call him once. I said yesterday, he didn't sound like a New Yorker. He is in New York. He's up not just, Absolutely, disgusting. And just because he doesn't have the accent, man, he doesn't need it. He doesn't need the accent. He's a jerk. Sure is. And you know, one thing about Howard, he, I grant you, we show his funny at times, not every day, but I like his show. But for example, remember when we had the so far campaign, and we tried to get him to go along and have a hug. He's the biggest loser when it comes to really, you know, he's like in a cocoon at his agents. They like keep him that way. You know, like, well, Howard doesn't need anybody else. You know, Howard's like, can take on the whole world. Well, we got a good insight into the people around him this morning. Yeah. We call it to say hi. Yeah, we try to be friendly. We just ask one question. How you did all your material from our show, right? That's all we do is call it. I got news for it. It'll be a cold day in hell when you hear Howard Stern on this show again. Just like you said. Yeah. See? Yeah. See? See? See? You told the truth. I can't believe it. I just, I don't know whether the screamer eat a banana. 721 now, and say to four, and a boy who wanted to get even with a cat that pestered his own pet. Good for him. Was sentenced to 100 hours of community service. This is in Graham, North Carolina. And the reason is because he set the animal ablaze. Oh, visual said Jeffrey Todd Nantes 16 persuaded a 12 year old boy to abduct a neighbor's cat, which was taken to some woods near the youth house in Burlington, North Carolina, doused with gasoline and set a fire. It was really funny, but not when the log out here said Nantes. A couple hours after the cat died. It was real funny. At first, he thought it was real funny, but not when the log out. How about if we said him ablaze? I'm not going to support you. Mr. Recelebrity? Yeah, right. You won't hear him again. Mysterious firewalls and flashes of light seen over the Atlantic coast from New Jersey to Virginia. Apparently we're from a meteor shower according to officials. Petty Officer Cameron McCladen of the Coast Guards, West Virginia Sessions said people, as far north as Kaitman New Jersey and as far south as Virginia's eastern shore reported seeing strange streaks of light. I saw one Saturday night. Good night, good morning. Yeah, but you see those every night, Captain. I swear to God, I saw one of those. It was late Saturday night. A long, streak of white meteor coming toward the radio station. Good night. Mostly cloudy today with a 30% chance of rain. Hi 72, low 57. It is 63 degrees at say to four. I've done it 723. The meal, Roger Scho. I'm say to four. Okay, now wonder if that tone is going to be on this cart, wait a minute. There it is. You hear it? Yeah. The time at the tone. 725. And it just wait a minute. You hear that? It like wobbled. I hear Mike. There's a higher tone with steady windwood. Here's higher tone on say to four. And then like kind of disappears. Boy, I'm telling you, this is they are so out of touch with what it takes to put a show on the ear on this station. You know what I'm saying? They're so out of touch. They have no clue. And I hear Paul Kangus and Bambing away to back. And we have sounds that haven't been invented yet. Okay, on Zeta 4. Yes, listen to this show closely. Yeah, and you're going to hear things that are just going to make you blow your mind. Turn it up loud. Trust me when I tell you. It's the old new lever to be heard. Starring, bond, revealing's late. You blow on me. Tony Donn. And Clint Eastwood as the beaver. That's all for now, children. Recent. Everyone except the adorn. Oh, crap. What I do now. Beaver. I brought you to my friend. Well, I am your friend, Miss Landers. But that's all it is, friends. But then how can I be your friend? Ah, geez. You're not going to ask me out again, are you? But I have to ask you. Look, we've gone all through this before. I'm not taking you out again. I'm going to see you, door. I'm afraid I'm going to have to write a note to your father. You're going to write a note to my dad. Seeing you got the hot for any erode boy. You know the ador. I've always thought to her one of the nicest boys in this class. No, no, Miss Landers. Say no more. Look, you're fun to go out and have a few beers with and everything. But why don't you save it? Make a move on me and one of my next dirty hairy movies to something, huh? All right, the ador. Nothing personal. I mean, you got a nice bond and everything. Okay. Tony. Tony, Tony, he's going to be our special in studio guest tomorrow. Boy, that's going to be exciting. No, he's not going to be here. He's holding CD looking now. Yeah. He doesn't wear those thin plastic belts. 28 past seven on Z84 and on Zany for that's going to be our new logo here. Might as well be because or is it Zany? Zany, that's where they say it gloves. Is it really? Zany. Are they're pretty Zany guys of the Zany morning show? If you missed it earlier, we placed our usual early morning call to Greg and Donald. And unfortunately, we were met with some resistance the first time around on the regular line. And then the second time when we called the war line, we got a warmer reception. But unfortunately, we cannot speak to them because the powers that pay me over at the glove 94 are getting real nervous. What do they nervous about that PD John Moron? You know, they're PD. Yeah. Another one on. Yeah. Jesus. And he does all the calls we placed this morning. We have met with resistance. That's right. Like even Howard. Yeah. What does Howard got to be worried about is making a million bucks a year? I don't even remember why we called him yesterday. Do you? What do we call for? I just for the hell of it. You got to look a card from a list. Or that's right. And he gave us a number. And then today we call just to ask a simple question about a room for straight not all these ugly rumors that Howard's going to be on the ear in Miami and all these other cities. Which I told you yesterday was ridiculous. No way in the world. First of all, Howard wouldn't last in this market for five minutes. Okay. No. They wouldn't tolerate it. And that's not my judgment because I enjoy Howard. But this market is just too immature, too childish. And there are too many maniacs out there. Busing monitoring every word that everybody says. And it just would not fly here. I'm telling you. There's no way. Can you imagine? I mean, who would put him on the ear? Someone desperate. No, no. You, you name me one station in this market that would put him on the ear. I can't think of any. No, I really can't. I really can't. So that's the way. There are all these. Yeah, besides this one. Oh, yeah. I can just see it now. Here's Bob Gilbert's and Howard Bob would like to have a couple of words with you. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. Oh, cool. I mean, he doesn't want to hear how big your private parts are, Howard. Can you imagine how we're doing the search for the biggest man of Miami? Maybe Howard would like to hear how big Bob's private parts are. Yeah, this smallest man in Portland. Seven, thirty on Zeta 4. By the way, do you know that there are, this is pretty interesting. They're getting so paranoid around here. There was more to the story than meets the eye with yesterday's meeting about the FCC ruling on indecency. Mm-hmm. There's more to the story. They didn't tell us. Did they tell you? No. About the fact that somebody in Portland whose name I mentioned only moments ago is having another nervous breakdown. By the, oh, he's does. And finally Gary and Mark and Paul. Oh, yeah. The powers to be here at, uh, stand told that. Yeah. They finally said, hey, you know, we're putting our feet down. Mm-hmm. They were Gary puts his foot down. They overreacted. And it's I6 shoe. It's really something. Yeah. It's the usual of a reaction of Portland. That's what I'm looking at this. Are we lucky this morning? Have Captain Dave off Mike with us here in the studio? Now, you're just putting me on the air because you don't have your own show and your desk. That's right. In fact, we call, uh, Love 94. We call the K-Rock. Who else can we call it? Let's see. What a call Rick and Spuds? No, they're not. They're boring. Okay. Can you put up a ring? Tanner. We can call, uh, McKeon in the morning. You know, the number over there? Oh, I sure don't. Oh, but I'm sure Captain Dave will be happy to look it up for us. Or you can call 411. Well, in other words, they just answer the call in line? I don't know. We probably don't have a call in line. I mean, you're all automated. Oh, not in the morning. No, I understand that. But I'm saying they're automated so much of the day. They probably ain't all the phones out to save money or something. Oh, I don't know. You don't like here. 731 on Zeta 4 and one of those engineers did they say which year they were coming? By the way, how long have you had that earring? Since August? I never saw that before. Did you ever notice that? Yes. We've been doing this show now for, uh, over for about two months. I never noticed that before. I thought that the summer get rid of it. It was a gift from my daughter. No, it's all right. It was a thing. Did you get it from your daughter? Yes, you did. She tried to tell you something. Do you know Captain Dave has a, like, a 15 year old daughter? Really? Well, she had a 16 in March. Oh, boy. So, be moving down here? No, she's not. Yes, she is. You're just when you have. Oh, boy. Oh, all these stories about all these young girls who are moving down here. Okay. I don't want any. We've got plenty of young girls here already. Okay. You understand? There are plenty of young girls there. All right. We don't need any new ones moving down. Do we need anything? Yeah, long rest in my house. That's what we need. Long rest. He's an quiet and tranquility. That's why I signed this already. I already, I immediately signed and headed back to my Reddit. And it's so innocuous. I said, hey, here you go. Yeah, I want to know that this is a momentous occasion in my professional life. Yeah, I wanted to sign it on the air. Go on. So I have read the policy regarding FCC. And that means you're going to stop doing all those indecent intros to the show. It's a clown. But it's always signed. I agree. Policy of the station has got nothing to do with the ruling. Oh, can other words, they can say it's okay to put an indecent broadcasting on it any time. We do not subscribe to that. Okay. Correct. That's correct. As we be. Upstanding broadcast. You betcha. Now we can't get the show on the air. Engineers are brain dead. But I'm just saying the pets are not relevant. That's not particularly relevant to anything. And we're just stalling for time. Basically is what we're doing. Because if you think I'm taking any more calls, you are in a dream world, baby. You are in, oh, you don't what we found? Mm-hmm. Look at that. Did you find this? Oh, yeah, I pulled that out of the game. Yeah, well, I tried to play this yesterday while Elvis Jr. was here. And E.J. I'm sorry we couldn't find it. But a certain unnamed tacos who tried to play it yesterday after you know his show. I've got some shun. And couldn't find it. Oh, W.I.N.C. Okay, that's just a little musical hand. Okay. I want to mention his name. But a certain host was in here sometime between Friday and yesterday Didling around with carts again. See, actually the whole reason he's become so surly on the year last few days. This is like Neil's material with draw syndrome that he's going through. No, it is. And he can't get in here. And he can't steal all of our stuff. For example, there are a couple of things we played today for the first time that I know he would have loved. Like the Elvis Christmas thing. Mm-hmm. And the love Bimbo. Oh, yeah. Yeah, he would have certainly loved. Even though he wouldn't understand it. He would have loved another thing. Uh, by gay. He would have liked. Or whatever that thing is. Oh, go ahead. Yeah. He'd have loved it. He still would have loved it. Yeah. Because he never heard it before. That was real funny. It was funny. You write about the with draw symptoms. Like when somebody stops smoking. Mm-hmm. They get real grumpy. Yeah. And of course, we're going to go through the same thing. There's no code. We're not going to call Howard anymore. We can't use any of his material. And we can't call Donald. And Greg. Gregory. We can't. We can't get him tomorrow. Great. Well, call him every day. Great. No, the warm line. I think we ought to have a little thing. Well, some of us already do. Now, I think we ought to have a thing. And I think we ought to see if they can most of the courage to buck the management over there. Don't you? By the way, you sound good this morning, Tom. There's Tom Gallagher with the news in the background. I love the nerve. And when you call him the nervous laughter at the beginning. Yeah. Yeah. The figure's out who it is, which usually doesn't take very long. It's that very paranoid. It's a laughter. Like a Jack Nichols. Yeah. Well, I know that directly. Across between Tony Perkins and Jack Nichols. Now, that's my mind. Yeah, really is. I know that came from John Moran. Is that a fact? You know that when Greg was in Chicago over the holiday week any state of the Bates Motel? That's true. That's a true story. And so you're trying to call the warm line tomorrow. I bet you get that DDD. No, it's been changing. First of all, it couldn't change it that fast. This is a week. This week. I think this week not change it one day. If they start at about nine this morning. No. And it doesn't. Hey, listen, I want all you bureaucrats over there. And it makes no difference. What number you're changing to? Because we'll have it the same day. That's right. Okay. So it doesn't make any difference. Just not the only thing that you could accomplish. You put a line in there with no number on it. You know what I mean? How did you know that number from when you worked there? Yeah, that's been the warm line. Ever since they've been in that building like two years. Right? I mean, that lane excuse you gave us. We put them on the air and they didn't know it. Oh, who was he kidding? They were listening. He said it's so mean too. Yeah. I'm sorry. We cannot talk to you because it's not a real deal. Yeah, you're violating FCC rules and regulations. You're putting us on the air without telling us. Ron Reagan's last thing. What did we think we were doing? Just calling him the chat off the air? Just calling him to see how they're feeling. What the temperature was. Yeah. Oh, gee. Can't believe those guys. Well, it's not their fault though. He did admit that he was he felt badly about it. Yeah. He has no problem with it. No, he felt bad about it. Not badly. Yeah. He felt lousy about it. They have, um, idiots for, uh, management. Do they really? Oh, God. Hmm. You think it's bad here? Yes. Oh. This is nothing. This is child's play. Okay. Now, these two engineers who are allegedly on their way over here, we don't see them yet, but I'm sure that any moment to show ends at 10 o'clock. I just mentioned that in passing. We got to play commercials. Oh, we do. Okay. I wonder why he got up and was halfway out the room. It certainly wasn't because he wanted to. 737 on Zeta 4. Let's do one of these big commercial breaks when we end. If you're wondering why we're not taking a lot of calls, uh, we give you five guesses. And the first four don't count. Okay. There's something about most $5,000 imports. The manufacturers don't want me to say. But you already know the truth. Models of the advertised price often don't exist. Until now. Chevy in what centers have hundreds of 54.95 cars. In stock. Chevy in port centers now open at all day-browered Chevy dealers. See the new 88 Chevy imports like Chevy's brain Metro with an MSRP of just 54.95. Not one or two hundreds of 54.95 imports in stock. But hurry to a day-browered Chevy dealer. At our grand opening sale, you can't even pay less. Chevy imports centers. 54.95 cars that exist. Okay. It's a 22 before 8 on Zeta 4. And we continue to apologize for other people's ineptness. I guess that's our job, right? We have to keep apologizing. We're sorry. We're sorry. And here's Brangalig on Zeta 4. You have that somewhere. Yeah, we do. Probably in the other room. It's in the other room. It is interesting that the lines finally they finally got the message that we're not going to be taking any calls. Look at that. That's pretty depressing when you have to sit here and look at a dead board because you can't put any calls on the air. And you keep looking out the window waiting for the engineers to come in. And you don't see them. I don't see them. I don't see them anywhere. They know where to be found. Did they live in South Florida? There's probably only one guy in the business more incompetent technically than our engineering staff. Stand with you. Okay, it's 21 before 8 on Zeta 4. We're just playing a lot of bits and that's good because our one of our early callers of rum earlier in the morning. He said that we don't play enough bits like we used to on a. And now we got like an epidemic, many epidemic of callers who started critiquing again and doing their amateur program director bit. And it's not the same as it was on a. I'm an on and on. How long is that going to go on? It probably go on as long. You remember what I used to ask how many people want the news back midday on a. And I had been on for 10 months. Yeah, but when gigantic numbers and I sit down, okay, all you people want the news back and aligns their friend. Okay, listen, all you people want the breakfast club back on Zeta 4. We're not going to answer the phone. Let's just see those phones flash. Okay, 620 3600 and date and 779 3600 and Broward. Come on. Let's see you folks wake up and do something important here on the phone. Uh, all you people who want there. They go, okay. That's great. You I could screen a couple of these and know you couldn't. And then you can't do that. You may need you can't screen them. Make them promise that they won't fall in. Make them promise right. Those are be the first ones to blur it out about six in a row. Okay. Six in a row on Zeta 4. Right after we sign that agreement. Yeah. Wouldn't that be classic? Uh, Hey, now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Isn't that pretty interesting? I don't want to sound paranoid, but isn't that interesting? Like we signed our lives away yesterday and we promised. We, uh, we, in fact, they made sure that nobody had their fingers crossed or their legs crossed. And Gene Kaspen was upset about that. They made sure that everybody was under best behavior and signed that little sheet. And we weren't going to do anything in decent. And we were going to follow FCC guidelines. And today we come in and just by coincidence that the lay isn't working today. Okay. So if we hadn't caught it, thanks to that nice lady who called an ass. How come on hold she was hearing the same as she was on the radio. Right. Wasn't for her. And the fact that I looked over there with my John this eye and noticed there were no lights. Lighting on the delay. Uh, we could have done something something going to happen for which we would have been given responsibility. So you're suggesting. Saps of time. Oh boy. So you think there's someone in this building. Yeah. Who shouldn't wait here. Okay. Here comes two automobiles now, frantically in the gate in the wins. Zeta gate ladies and gentlemen. Let's take a look. Okay. The first one looks like who is it? Oh, that's, is that that maniac from the AM sales? Who is it? I can't tell you. Okay. It's a government license plate. Is it really? Oh, it's the FCC. They're here to investigate our engineering department. Good. It's about time. Once, Jan. Oh, one is Jan. She can't help us. No. It looks nice to see her. She probably could do a better job than the engineers. Could pull hate. Like maybe putting the plug in the wall would be a good start on the digital Do other's Wendy Harmon. The other's Wendy Harmon who's not going to do us well. So that's not the engineers we were looking for and the show continues to drag on on this Wednesday. I like this conspiracy theory. Yeah. I didn't have a feeling. In fact, what we ought to do is call up our own spectators. Senator and Pennsylvania. What's the guy from New Orleans? What was his name? Jim Garrison. Oh, great idea. You know, let's check out the assassination conspiracy theories on the New Roger show on Zeta 4. Okay? Because there's somebody in this building who's trying to deep-six this program. So you don't buy that. This was just a coincidence. No, you don't buy that. No, you don't buy that. Too many coincidences in this part of the building. They surround me. Yeah. I used to never notice coincidences. Now they're all around me. Yeah. Like when I came in this morning in the microphone sounded like we were doing the show of 16 feet under water. You know, I don't look upon that as a coincidence. Uh-huh. And when the cart button was popped off there, I don't look upon that as a coincidence. I look upon it with great disdain. Now let's take this gun. That's the real thing. Two words. Okay. We'll put coincidences over here. Yeah. And we'll put in neppness over there. And then you have to have a third category, which would be a... Oh, no. Well, you said in neppness. Yeah. I couldn't resist. I know it comes to mind. Hurricane. It's still the month of May. Let's take up a fund for students. The old age fund. I guess you say, what can make me feel that way. I think the stand major synality fund is just building. He's, I don't know what his problem is, boy. But he called last night. It was no problem. I mean, like, off the air, we're fine. But on the air, it's like he wants to have World War III man. He's not joking. He's serious. Oh, I know. He's talking about all that music and trying to prove how much he knows about me. He doesn't have to do that. I didn't have to prove anything. He just do the damn show. And at a meantime, all he's doing is talking about me. He doesn't have any shows. He doesn't have any calls. I mean, he's got some cranks. But he has just like nothing left. He's a shell of the man he used to be. Well, the other thing he's real upset about. And he's like, we had EJ on here. Just to Elvis Junior. Yeah. And we didn't give him any credit. Oh, yeah, I heard that. He said, how come they don't? He invented EJ and the Don Jr. He discovered. Yeah. He discovered that. Yeah. Did we ask them to come on this show? I mean, I like both of them. And it's fine that they wanted to be in it. Did I, do we need them? No, it's not that. But that you did have Elvis Junior on. No, wait a minute. He came in here to cut a spot. But you asked him to come in here. But he was funny. And we enjoyed him coming in. And he was great. And he just said, Oh, thank you, Stan. Yeah, that's what he was. Thank you so much. Okay. That now he's happy. You're a system, I think. We just give credit that's. So, the next two is they when we have Michael Talboton. We have to give him credit for that, too. Did you hear a door? I heard a jar. I didn't hear it. A door is a jar. I love that in your car when you have all that digital stuff. You know what I'm saying? Your door is a jar. Your keys are in the evening. Wouldn't that be some kind of a car if your door was a jar? Maybe it would be a specimen jar. Let's go back to that. Let's not. And say we did. Okay. Oh, no. This is in monochrome. It's from AAM. Of course. It's in plano. It's in AAM. This has been quite a day so far. And it's not even eight o'clock yet. That's right, Glenn, as a matter of fact, it's 746. Yeah, isn't it exciting? Well, let's preempt that. I'm going to call Jeff Stryker, okay? Jeff Stryker. We're not just gonna take me to Asmaro today. I've never done anything I knew about. I've found my inner heart.
