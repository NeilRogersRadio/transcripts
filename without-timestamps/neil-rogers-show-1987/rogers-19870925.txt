And it'll know man's land. All right, we go to that publics and stay and immediately says, look at all of these incredible people coming out of this store. Even one of the bag boys approached me in that store and said, our union roggies, I couldn't believe it. Now, it might not necessarily have been the one that I was hoping for, but that was the first. We're starting to move in the right direction. One of the bag boys in that publics recognized me. Listen to the show. His brother listened to it. It was just in credible. Then stay went into a little store and that same shopping center called scoop to nuts, or they sell coffee and nuts and stuff like that. And the kid who was working behind a counter was sitting there on a Hershey's chocolate milk telephone. You ever see one of those? I mean, it really is impressive when you walk into a place of business. And a guy sitting there behind a cash register talking on a, what looks like a big container of chocolate milk. You know, that's impressive. Like maybe they belong in a rubber room or something in this store. And he also had a very interesting companion sitting there next to him, which was, I don't know what function he was serving other than perhaps the boost morale, but that was a really interesting experience. And Stan was grinding the coffee and I was hanging out at the counter. And then came the moment of truth. Because finally, he's got his scooped his coffee and I've scooped everything I can get my hands on in there. And now he says, you want to go up for some ice cream to e-mac and bullios. And I said, well, boy, this could be embarrassing. And then I said, that's a good enough reason in itself. Let's go. And we drive up there and who's behind a counter, but a young lady that I've never seen before. No Brian, no Josh, not even Susette. Oh, I shouldn't have said it that way. Should I? Susette will take except for all I don't mean not even. But I mean, we know, Susette. Here's this new young lady. And of course, Stan is now at this point, salivating, foaming at the mouth, crawling over the counter, carrying on in his usual subhuman barbaric behavior, right? And it comes to find out that this young lady is... Misha. Not the one from Channel 10, though. Misha. My bell. These are words that go together well. Okay, so now we get the ice cream. Stan is just dribbling and drooling over the counter. We go outside. Almost nobody there last night, by the way. Look like a ghost town. There was a couple that came in while we were there. We go outside. Now this couple comes out and it turns out that it's Dan and Lisa. Not David and Lisa, but Dan from Chicago and Lisa. Okay? And this just, it kind of starts to snowball now. And now there are other people who know us who are showing up. Not at whole lot. And it turns out that Michelle knew who we were assumed that we were very upset because Brian wasn't there. Stan of course took great homage to that because his image is rapidly wilting. But anyway, to make a long story short, we didn't sue that finally showed up a little bit later on. Everybody is happy. Nobody's upset. They did take my name off the blackboard. I will mention that. They did for some bizarre reason take Uncle Neill's name off the blackboard. And as a piece offering because I like there, I've always liked the Rice Cream stand who really wasn't that crazy until he saw Michelle last night. Now has suddenly taken a great turn. And loves. He earns for their ice cream. Okay? He salivates for it. And at about 330 this afternoon, he's going to make such a jackass out of my want you whatever you do. Make a note on your calendar now at about 330 this afternoon. Be sure to be listening to the stand major show because he's going to just totally humiliate and degrade himself on the air for this little high school girl. Now would we do that on this show? No. For Brian, for example, of course not. Just a radio show. When I go there, I go for the ice cream. If there are any other amusements to look at, that's great. But you know, Stan, he takes all of this very seriously. I mean super seriously. So Monday night, we decided that there are no football games on Monday night, right? No, no, no football games on Monday. Now while I'm getting choked up about it, you know, I'm one of those people who can't survive without my football. And so we thought that we would try it again. Now last Monday was very spontaneous. And even though it was just a couple of mentions, look at the crowd we had. We had people from everywhere who showed up. And this Monday night at about seven o'clock, not only will Stan major in the O'Rangers be at the ice cream store, but for his first pelvic appearance ladies and gentlemen, the bird. Now we know that it's a mistake. We know that his image will never be the same again. And those of you who want to bring your cameras, those of you or an anthologist out there, bird watchers, bring your binoculars, your cameras, whatever else, your little Twitty bird glasses. And all you got to do is envision Twitty bird before you come out, then you'll never be disappointed. I guarantee you that he will not disappoint if you keep Twitty bird and Elmer Fud in mind. You'll be all set. You'll be ready to go. And I have a feeling we could to redeem ourselves. We might even see our names up in the lights again. Black, Black, Black board and Susette asked us for the schedule. I don't want to get any of you desperate queens upset out there because I know there are a lot of you in this audience who are almost as desperate as I am. And we suggested a nice schedule, a nice balance would be Josh and Michelle to work on Monday. Because it got to be more than one if there's a crowd like there was last Monday, right? We don't want to have to subject Brian to all of that oogling and all of that embarrassment again because it's obviously having a negative effect on his life. And in addition to that, there probably be a lot of dirty old men who would come out and try to reach across the counter and say, can that be felt? We don't want that. We just want a nice peaceful ice cream face. That's all. Some marshmallow, the fubanan is little whipped cream, a couple of nuts. That's all we expect. And of course with the bird there, there is no telling. There may be really strain. Now we had a lot of wonderful people who came out last Monday, very normal looking, some of them very nice looking. Now that we've announced an advance that he's coming out, there's no telling. What's going to happen? There probably be 30 river Phoenix lookalikes. We'll just show up just for the hell of it. Maybe 30 Phoebe Kate's lookalikes will show up on Monday. Who knows? That's going to be about seven o'clock Monday night. I don't think we're going to go and eat the melting pot that I don't know saying if Dave is listening, we appreciate it. But I just, I'm just a little bit leery about opening up any new avenues. So after the ice cream, we're on the way. I'm back to drop standoff at his car and he says, I hate to say this, but I got to go to Windixie. How many supermarkets can you go to in one evening, right? To hell of a pastime, and you can't really spend all that much money, unless you're loading up on groceries, which I don't really buy in it. I buy a couple of bottles of diet, cherry, seven up, and make it look good. And sure enough, we're going to Windixie and there's Roberto is there last night. And all of these other wonderful, great people and a couple of young ladies who are shopping there that had Stanley crawling around on the floor, making barnyard noises, just another night at the local supermarket. So if I sound a little bit worn out, it's because it was a rough rough evening. And of course, there are probably some of the folks in the audience who, since we spoke to the Monstan show yesterday, at six o'clock, have been making some of these phone calls. Now we did do our damn visit to get through the Jeff Stryker yesterday afternoon. We had a couple of really desperate people on the phone. I mean, desperate who almost got in touch with them. And we did finally get in on it. They see what you find out with all of these numbers. And that's a big come on. Like you're going to call Michael Jackson or something. I don't know why anybody would want to. You're going to call some big celebrity. And it turns out that those celebrities are never there. But it's always the other part of the offer. It's one of those group deals where they're whole bunch of people get on the line, which they love, because everybody who's calling in is paying the charge. So they get like a dozen people on there at the same time. And they're all paying the two bucks for a couple of minutes. And then they got to call back. They're just like they're feeding the quarters into the machine, like crazy. And we did have a whole bunch of people. I was really fascinating to watch John McLaughlin last night up there. Kyle should have been here to oversee that, because it was one of the most incredible jobs in the history. I would say no more than 10, 15 minutes to get the two people on together at the very most. It was a little nerve wracking to say the best. But we did our best. We tried. We did get Jeff muttering somewhere in the background. He said something like, oh, God, that's good. And that was it. So probably we'll hear from some people who got through on that line. And then we had the guy who called in who gave us these other numbers for day. And we gave the sweet blues number up. So we probably have a lot of satisfied customers this morning who have been calling these numbers all over the country. And they just have in a hell of a great time, okay? It's a good time 24 before 11 in WI and Z. Our first caller this morning, we are very honored to have on a mobile phone. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? Neil, listen, I was listening to your show yesterday. You mentioned Michael Jackson's video. Yeah. Yeah. The spurs on his boots, those like silver things. Yeah. I want to get a pair. You know, I can get some. Yeah, I think the Olympus Corral, I think you're having a sale on them this weekend in Miramar. They look pretty good at me. Yeah. I want to get a pair of my own. Listen. How that bird, if he belongs in that wing being for Y100. The wing being? Yeah, that's what they're having over that. They're having a wing being? Yeah. That's the wing being. It's not one person to ask me. Okay, well, listen, have a wonderful life, my friend. How much is this called costume? I don't know. We'll find out when I get to build. Okay. Well, send it to the bird. He'll take care of it for you, sir. Okay? Okay. He'll go on. Someone mailed you a cart again. You know, I don't know what's going on, but you know, they're like listeners who are mailing us cartridges from radio stations. If all you engineers are wondering where the cars are disappearing to in South Florida, don't blame us. Yeah. Look at that, 7279. That's an old cart. It's not at all off. It was really well. How long is it? It's a four minute. That's good. We like those. We can use those. Who is this from? Mike Future, Broadcaster. Do you know Mike Future? I guess that's a disjucky name. Mike Future, like Linda Energy and I see it came from a broadcasting school. Charlie Dark. Now, there's radio name. He's the one who sent a sex over the phone. Oh, your mama. That's yo mama. Yo mama. Yo mama. Okay, we'd be good and you'd be bad. Okay, should I try this on the ear? Should I play it? Coli says it's playing it's by Cheechen Chang'nl. Could be good. It could be disgusting. Could be filthy. Well, Cheechen Chang'nl. Did Vanna pick me a letter? That's Cheechen Chang'nl. It is? Yeah. Obviously. Cheechen Chang'nl. How do you know that? Can tell by the sound. By the voice? You know it's them for sure. Absolutely. Positive. Sure. You bet your life on it. You bet. A man of the payphone said the WKPX need $6,000 to repair the damage it was done by the lightning strike. What are we supposed to do? Take donate. Hey, well raise the money for him. We can't afford to go non-directional in the daytime because we have all of the equipment sitting back on the FM. But we certainly would be delighted to raise money for WKPX so they can be very nice to us again. What can we do for you, Mr. Rogers? You do? Would you like to send them a couple of noise? If you'd like to make a donation call the business line at WKPX 748286. You know, if they're deep into your pocket because we know that the students in Piper High always have their hands deep in their pockets. And it's morning class. Good morning class. Here's the biology class this morning at Piper High. Thank you. As you know, your regular teacher, Sister Rosetta Stone, is on a small vacation. However, he does send her love and these finger paintings and thus cloths she's making. I am your substitute teacher, Sister Mary Elephant. Okay, I think we'll be joining that in progress. I wonder, wouldn't that be good? We can join that back and forth throughout the day. I want to overdo it. That was a minor hit. I think they used to play that on Wyland 100 back in the 70s. Yeah. Are you serious? I think Sister Mary Elephant. Okay, what was this about crazy creamer that somebody was saying the other day? The music man? Crazy creamer. Crazy man. What about him? What about the old guy? Somebody made some kind of a psycho sexual in you window the other day when I was on with staying. Oh, yes. Are creamer and me as a matter of fact, we were going to do something with the cheerleaders like what? Not much. Sorry about the sounds like creamer to me. I'd like to hear what you're odd couple. We'll check with Tanner and see what he has to say about it. Let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Mobile. Go on in. Hello. Hello. Mobile. Good job. Thank you for the outmired seat there today in the mail. Okay, now let me ask you this. Was it all folded up and crinkled like the one that the other guy called in about? I checked that out. First thing I was figuring out the girl said he post office. Did something with it? Yeah. But I looked at the postmark and you didn't want to say? Oh, Barack. Oh, yeah. That's all our mail goes through. Oh, it goes through, Barack. Yeah. Oh, that explains it. You know, by the way, the soul tonight gets funny. Wait, it did come to the mail and I've done it. No, you'd be good and you'd be bad. Okay. What's that? Okay. Okay. Is that it? That's it. You know, people can talk in a water cooler, you know. Are you going to come up and see us at the ice cream store on Monday? That's the question. Probably not. What time? 7 o'clock. 7, 8, you know, rounded in there. Oh, yeah, I might do that. Sure. You might fall for me. Can't you? Can't you relate to this? Tanner can relate to this. He dealt and the Rick and Spuds, you bet. You would. He dealt it. I'm going to get the dead ear again. Okay. How to go. Wait a minute. You were probably waiting for response, weren't you? What? And one of the ways, one of the very easy and inexpensive underlying in red ways of doing that, is doing what you is doing. I know. Okay. Listen. Okay. These presents yesterday were from power 96. No. They stole to a freight train. We didn't get the joke. But that's what the train. What do you mean they were from power 96? They called yesterday. Well, who are these people at Brottom Inn? That was that magazine, right? That was from the people. You mean inches? One that you were telling you a Terry about in the hall is I was leaving. He asked me. You are the worst gentleman. He asked me. I'm leaving the studio. He's got me. Terry cornered up against the wall. He's saying, no. She has the magazine today called inches. No. She came to me and asked me about it. About what? It's just a picture of Jeff Stryker again on the cover with his beautiful, deep tan body. That's what I told her. I mean, who cares about that? The people brought you that. And if you open it up to the center fold, it's got another picture of Jeff Stryker with this is a beautifully tan body. And his motor cycle. And what a motor cycle. That's disgusting. I mean, I hate to say that too. But that's it's just it's wrong for him. Okay. He needs to have a transplant. That does not belong on his body. It doesn't fit. Now, first of all, it looks very red and swollen first of all. And it just does not belong on his body. The rest of everything is great. They can't help it. But that's no, that does not belong there. I'm sorry. Am I right Terry? That doesn't. No, it doesn't. It doesn't fit. It's disgusting. Now I could recommend him to a great surgeon. You know, that I saw last night for the we did the preliminarys. And this weekend, I'm having the surgery finished. From an on Monday, he said, My more voice might be a little higher, but that's Michael Jackson, such a big hit already. That's just a genetic accident. Yeah, like the rest of us, a genetic accident. So you have to take the good with a bat. Right? Right? You can't help. Have to take the thick with the lean. Point and beach, hello. Hello, Neil. On his dime, I can't believe it. What a nice day. Okay. Last of the big times. I'm right too. Huh? I'm running on you last night too. What do you mean by that? I spoke to Jeff Strikker for you. Okay. Did you didn't get to really talk to him, did you? Yes, I did. Actually. I have a way. There wasn't it. No. I swear. I'd listen. Maybe you're not breathing hard, but I am. I didn't normal, they don't conversation. On normal, literate, articulate conversation. Eight very nice person. What did he have to say? I'm well, I spoke about you. Ooh. And he would like to speak to you. Oh. And he gave me a number and he'd like me to get some number to new. And call him back and he'd like to come. He'd like to what? Oh, you are in the air. Do you realize what we did? We did have an 89 share on that. They even a straight guy's in town. Our now obsessed with Jeff Strikker. I found that. Is it true? He offered to send you an autograph picture. Oh. I offered to send me one, but I didn't want to give him my address. Why not? Why not? Oh, you. So what's wrong with that? Because he said he's coming to Miami. He's going to be spending a lot of time down here. And you didn't give him your number? I got his number to call him back. When's he coming to town? I got my. Hi. Hi. When's he coming? I'm actually out on there. He's getting accepted to come down here. He's got a lot of work to do. I'll bet. He said, you know, he worked there. My audience alone could keep him busy for days on end. That's what I told him. I didn't think he's got devoted fans all over the place. Oh, boy. I asked him. I said, are you getting an inordinate amount of phone calls from Miami? And he said, yes. He said, you know why? I said, well, this person, the old Rogers. And you said this person. You didn't say that, did you? Yeah. I don't want you to spoil my image. Try to blow chop a little bit. Come on. It's just a coincidence. So how did you get through to him? You just dialed a number? Yeah. I'll tell you what. I was going to movie last night. I got dressed. I was standing around waiting for my ride. What was it? Power tool, part six? The big easy. Okay. Close. Yeah. Anyway, so I'm standing there waiting. And I said, what the heck? I'll call him up. And I, the phone rang through. And I thought it'd be when these stupid recordings. Yeah. And the phone rang in it clicked over. And I didn't say anything. And I heard this hello. I said hello. He said, who says? I said, well, who's that? He said, yes. I said, is this really just right? I think it's a really calling. I'm going to ask me my name and all this stuff. And then it clicked off and I had to call him back. You know, you had your little two minutes. And then I started talking to me. And we'll hear a call me back at this number. Yeah. And it won't be interrupted. Are you serious, boy? No. And noninterrupted. An interrupted. We talked about. Jet was not interrupted. As the Greeks used to say, yes. But he would, very much, like to speak to you on the, I think you wanted to promote his new movie. Of course. We need to light it up about his new movie. I'll strike her for us. Strike her for us? I can't. Oh, yeah. That's the, by one. Is it where he teaches you if you want it. You got a buy it. Yeah. So what are all these numbers? Do you want to give him the Kyle? Um, because we don't want to give money here. He told me not to give them out. He asked me to get the numbers from you and call him back. To do what? He wanted me to call him with the number. Oh, with what number? Oh, we can give him the hotline. Yeah, you have that number that he wouldn't have to wait on. Hold like a kiss. Oh, yeah. Yeah. But she in other words, you don't want to give us his private number. Oh, yes, we not can. Oh, but we can give him how much, how much would it cost? Oh, we have my prizes to give away. Oh, I'll copy last week's TV guy. Sure. The Brooke Shields on the covers. How about teen magazine, 16? Kirk Cameron on the cover. I'm telling you. No. Okay, we can't. This guy can't be bought. River Phoenix inside. Right. No. No. Be stuff. This guy's tough. Hmm. Not even the whole peanut family. Really? Rainbow River. Not a bunch. All right. How about Jason get Rick's home phone number? You have to. Oh, I think we're getting close. Everyone has close. Right. They're from one Jason Gadgetray. Okay. How about the Pat Peterson's own Michael Jackson Glove? You used. No. Pat's going to get kicked off on the show. Why do you say that? He was on your last night. They were having his birthday party. Yeah. And we didn't get to see anything. Did you see it? I didn't see. I did. How do you know he's getting kicked off the show? I don't know that. No, no change. Sure. They're going to replace him with probably red. Red. Red button. Red button. That red button has never had Bob Hogan. Yeah, right. The bring back thing. Yeah. Yeah. Well, things not to sing into well. They're both about as excited. Yeah. Donna Mills and Bing both. They shoot them both through the same screen as matter. Right. Well, listen, how are we going to do this? He's on a four. So give him the hotline number. And then you can pass it on. Now, how are you sure you're going to get through to him again? Oh, you've got the good number. Yeah. Wow. Oh, boy. You don't realize what it is. You don't seem to understand that if you do. And then the position. People. The position you're in, well, we don't want to get into that. Okay. And it's a family show and they're monitoring important. So now you don't want to get into that position. That's your. Huh? It's three hours early. So how do they sound? I mean, can you give us a little, a little something? How do they sound? It's very nice. Because in the movies to be honest with you, he has a rather limited vocabulary, you know? He doesn't seem all that bright, but he's very nice. He's very friendly. Oh, yeah. Very friendly. Is he related to Brian the ice cream store by any chance? Are they mine? No, him. Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. What do you mean, where are you? Pointing gate. Oh, he's, that's right. He's in boit and this is on his dime. Good Lord. Well, this is important. You mean, there are Jeff striker fans in boit and beach? Holy cow. Now they are. Holy Toledo. They're my own fan club. So how long did you talk to them? About 15 minutes. Oh, my God. Just long enough, huh? No. No. No. You wouldn't do anything like that. No, no, no. Of course, when you can have the real thing. I know. Can I wait? If we all wait a lifetime. Okay. Well, I guess we're not going to squeeze any more out of you. So hold on a minute and Kyle will give you the bat line number. Then you give it to, you know, and tell them, now listen, a problem is we're on 10 to two eastern time. That's like seven in a morning till 11. 11 11 11 11. 11 11. 11 11. 12. 11. Yeah. He keep those numbers in my 7 11. You know, he's a 7 11. 11. 11 11. Yeah. In between there. Like he's probably up by 10. Yeah. Maybe even after a long rough night's work. He knew W.I. and V. He did. Oh, that's because he comes down here all the time. He said he's down there a lot. I said I know. Yeah, he said 21. I understand. I don't want to mention Alice's name. But somebody ran down there. Don't pick on him. Okay. Oh, I'm sorry. Did we do something to offend you? Okay. I'm trying to be very nice and you're tipping on her. Okay. Okay. Okay. He's on four. And if you would just give him the bat line, it will be all set. One of these days when we've used expected. Hmm. We'll come this voice on the radio. Hello. Is this Neil? Now, just to just a joke, Jeff, don't get upset. We know that you're a good. We've seen them movie. And he sounds okay to me. Limited of vocabulary. But talent. But certain talents and certain ability to stimulate this crowd. Exactly. That's hilarious. Even the straight guys like this Dan who brought his girlfriend. It was very beautiful, by the way. The girlfriend that is, um, Lisa. Although it was interesting. Gustand did not end. Of course she was blonde. Oh, well, Stan has no taste anyway. But she was really nice. But the Dan of course has a little earring. But he's a straight. You know, but he seemed to know who Jeff Stryker was. Sort of like me. It's eight minutes before 11. I wouldn't dignify that. Come. We'll come right back. Oh, you're never going to believe this letter. And it's just the one that came with the little button here. It's a good time. Put that right on. Put that right on. Yeah, I'll put it right on your beat. You don't just got up. And um, I'm just reading letters. Don't change a thing. Sooner or later, you will score. I wonder what he means by that. Would someone who can handle reality. Don't stop trusting people because of why. We should stop picking on boin. It wasn't his. He's okay. And his own way. He don't need the brain dead anyway. Keep up the great work. Your bababa. And it says, P.S. I changed my opinion of the bird while you were on vacation. He ran a hell of a show and gained much credibility and respect. He's worth keeping around. No, isn't that what I told you? And you laughed in my face. Yeah. Okay, we did have a call. It is after all yesterday was the first day of the observance of the Jewish New Year. New Year. Russia, Shana. We're in the year one. We're starting over again. We're just in the news about a tough history. And we just had a lady who called. Rather elderly lady who called Kyle upstairs was a little upset. She wants to get the place. I'm wonderful Jewish music. We would just love to hear some. You and me. When some show me all tries to put me down and says he has a lot of communication. I tell him right away. Now listen here to the kitchen. I heard a lot of you. This is not the word in the nation. I'll say give a call to friends of people. I'll show them how to talk to my smile. You smile, you'll tell them you're a smile. You smile, you smile, you smile, you smile. You smile, you smile, you smile. You smile, you smile. You smile, you smile. You smile, you smile. You smile. I knew Bob Yamoki and broiler didn't go. It's your info. I wear it everywhere. I go round to other hazelnuts. They don't know what to say. So be true to your show. I'm a friend of mine. I'll be jacked up on the sound and service. I'll be ready to pray. I'll be standing out my door presents me off the roof. I'll be in the choir now. She'll be singing away. Be true to your show. I'm a friend of mine. I'll be sure to tell them you're a smile. You smile, you smile, you smile. You smile, you smile, you smile. You smile, you smile, you smile. You smile, you smile. You smile, you smile. Good yon, just wherever you are. Happy New Year. Happy Lucas. And all out of the good stuff. I don't understand what this is. It's an open-on-year and a couple of cassettes in here with a $5 bill. I don't understand. What is this? What's it saying? It says, Mike Wolf is back from a couple of days on the cyclist. It says, I know the guy in this bill isn't big jam, but if you look at the serial number, you'll see he's packing a full house. I don't understand what this is. I guess they want to pay you five bucks for dubbing the cassettes. So I'll give you the cassettes. Well, fine. Sounds like a good deal to me. Mike is back and it's certainly wonderful to have a real great American and backwards men in the studio here. Bring you the headlines. World news from CBS with all the spots at 11. And we'll come back to lift your spirits. And whatever else you can get up at 1106. Now we've got double trouble. Neil Rogers tend to do and stand major two to six. Exclusively on 94 news wins. 70 YMZ Miami for Notre Dame. Thank you for my news. In the mail today, among other things, we have a beautiful car that somebody said, I'm not making this up. So don't accuse me of using foul language on the air. But it has a photograph. This is an actual photo of the sign at a restaurant in Ocean City, Maryland. And there's a picture. In fact, it looks like a member of your family. It's a very reminiscent, very familiar of a big bird. And it says, big peckers, barren, real. And I write that right off the sign in Ocean City, Maryland. And how do you spell that? It's something they're not here because they would not be allowed to advertise on this show.

And then just before the show started, it said, and also appearing. And it said, the Pat Peterson is Michael. And I was screaming in the living room. I was cheering. And there was nobody else there. But I was applauding and cheering. And it was very exciting. Very emotional time of my life. Yeah, we thought you would enjoy that last night. Yeah.
