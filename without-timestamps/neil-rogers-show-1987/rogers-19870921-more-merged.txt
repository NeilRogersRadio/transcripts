They're going to be in town Saturday night and I want to know if you can give some take a toy on the air. Why have you got some? Yeah, got a few. Oh sure. Oh great. Would you better get him out here tomorrow? Well can I bring him by today? Yeah. Oh. Okay. They're going to be at the cameo theater. No? No. Not the cameo. Oh. The colony. Oh, the colony. Well close to the gas. Right down the street from one another. Very good. Yeah, they're right. Right by each other. And also what I was thinking about is you don't play a penis at the anymore. So I tried to get a why. And I figured it's okay for adults to hear it. And I know it's okay for people to preach in this to hear it because they're too young but for teenagers like the crowd on Saturday that was calling. I never went to the Einstein's store and I have no desire to do it. But you had a lot of people across that at a who went to that ice cream store. Yes. And that is a real young crowd and I don't think that would be a good crowd to listen to. That's right. So I think it's because they never heard that word before I'm sure you know penis. Yeah. Well yeah. So often I get so many times and one time. Yeah. Too much. Yeah. Okay. So I think I'll come by this afternoon and give you what they say too much penis is too much. Too much. Yeah. That's what they say. Yeah. That's what they say. Yeah. I think that's exactly what they say. Okay. That's okay. I thought I heard that somewhere. Are you going to bring the tickets by or you're going to just torment us? No. Why may do you want? Well I'll say how about 10. That's okay. That's a nice even number. Okay. And I'll stop by this afternoon and who knows? I might be able to give you all your on the air. Or that too much. We'll see what happens. Okay. Just show up and we'll see what happens. Okay. All right. Thank you so much. First call is always. That wasn't the first call. It wasn't. But I always the lady right at the beginning of the show talking about ice cream. We started right in. She must have stock in that company. Are we giving them promotion or what? And what am I giving? What am I getting? I don't even get to look anymore. They keep giving me the wrong information. We drive all the way up there last night. It's got to be at least a seven minute ride for more of it. Boy, oh and you're no chance that they're going to buy any time because we're giving them all the street publicity. No chance. No chance. No chance. And you would even be thrilled to cut their stock form when you know they know chance. Okay. So like when I said how about the sending Brian over to co-host the show. No chance. Okay. I'm I'm Tonya. I just there's no hope just surrounded by mortal enemies. Broward. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. How are you doing? Okay. This is Dan. I moved down here from Chicago in January. I'm going to tell you I love your show. Good good taste, Dan. I took my girlfriend Lisa that you mac and boy was last night because I just moved in with her and I figured if I could pass the Brian and Josh test like a past any minute. Wait a minute. This is not from David and Lisa. This is Dan and Lisa from Chicago. Right. I just missed you. The girl behind the corner said I missed you by about a half hour. Well, what are the odds on that because David and Lisa both of whom are from Chicago were there earlier? Yeah. I know. That's what you said about my girlfriend's actually a sport. Oh, I see. I just met her down here. Yeah. Hey, what happened to this burden? Don't you understand that reason for the whole people trip? Oh, I'm honest. For the game. Don't you understand that? I mean, are you that slow? No, I guess that was that was one thing to beat Notre Dame but to beat them and the Pope. But no chance. No chance. Hey, you know, the WIND in Chicago. You would have put a curse on all of East Lansing if they would have won that fan. Yes, I do know if they placed this Spanish now. Right. Oh, it's fun. You'll talk about deserts, cousin on his brother side. Well, I just want to call it today. I like your show and we'll try to see the night. You mean you're coming back again? Well, I don't know. No, no Brian or cash. When I wait a minute, you said that you went there with your fiance, your girlfriend? Right. Then what do you want to see Brian and Josh for? Why figure if I can pass that then I can make it through anything? He's insecure. Insecured. Does he have primal doubts? Sounds like it. I think so. Hey, bird with up. Oh, I was just thinking about the big wind here that you were talking about. Hey, and we think about those bears. Stan? Oh, these people from Chicago are so cute. You guys know. Oh, confused. Well, you got to watch the couple some along. Yeah, we got to have someone that went from. Yeah, well, your season's over. So congratulations. He had the bears that had great season. I get it. To it all. Boy, that's a good season. And at Tom's act, boy, what a quarter back here. Is that? Yeah. You know what, 12 years old that kid? Yeah, I think you just turned 13 last Friday. Yeah, okay. All right, listen, we'll be looking for it tonight. And if Brian's not there, you'll see there'll be a little bloodletting. I'll be bringing my own razor blade tonight. Okay. Nice target. Okay. Let's see. We got David and Lisa and Dan and Lisa. Yeah. Boy, I'm going to get confused. We're just developing like a cult following at the ice cream store. When we do have a couple of deadlines, still not flashing there and at hurt like hell. I'll tell you that right now. That is just subhuman. That's my most people in Dave County. No, it's not a long day. It just whatever it is. They just don't want to play the game. No excuses today. The busy colon Joey's not even on the air anymore. Hey, dude, she's rocking role. Boy, that was so embarrassing. To have to pander to that kind of mentality. Talk about beer, all three of them. Yeah, beer. Oh, guysling that tiger stuff. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah, especially at his age. Dave County, good morning and welcome to WIN's E's Neil Rogers Show. Ben. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Phil. You know who this is? No. Make it good. How many guests are doing? Yes. You're going to give me the other day on 17 euros. Oh, yeah. Well, listen, once a king always a king, but once a king's not. We're Howard. Hello. Hello. Oh, are you? Good. I want, I know you're okay. I want to ask you a couple of things about you know I'm okay. I don't know. Because you're in a good mood. You got the bird there. Not in a good mood. I wasn't a good mood. And then they're touching around with a longer tape again here. And I know that somebody in the buildings up to know good again. You know. Always like when somebody's looking at your behind you know that. I'm not even going to say hello again. I'm just going to move out to the next one. What is this man thought? What in God's name is he talking about? We talk about the embassy. We send the truck for one minute. Sure. It's a great place to visit. You happen to meet the chef there. Oh, sure. Yeah. And the janitorial service. Of course I did now. And there for boxes. I didn't even eat there. Not once. I even have a banana there. Okay? Because it happened that I was in the hotel that we kind of, uh, you were up there. And I thought it was also a very good hotel. I want to tell you something that happened this weekend with it's a good time for the great taste. I was joking around with my wife and I was using the famous yellow rots of expression of which I do not know the roots. And I said it's a good time for the great taste. And then my little four-year-old girl goes, at McDonald's. So where did that come from? You don't have a clue? I really honestly, I would assume from a guy. I said good time. Where are you? Oh, yeah. Oh, he does great taste. It's their new slogan. Burger King. For me, how you want? It is for McDonald's. It's a good time. I like that. Listen, I haven't even eaten. It's their new slogan. That's been their slogan for about 400 years. What is wrong with all of you people? Are you all on some heavy, uh, I don't understand what's going on here today. You know, you talk about qualities like they've been around. They haven't been around for Hey, Ludes. Not following. Well, you're from. It's not like we're here. I'm not going to think here. You know what I'm saying? It's like you don't want to go synthesize or something. Well, Ludes. Wait, is that the way? Met the clay alone. All right. Farms, if you'll never be. Playside. Did you happen to get a picture of Pope John Paul on the mail from the pre-press? Yeah. Did you like it? Beautiful. Is it up in the studio? His dress was magnificent. His flowing gown. He looks better in green. Yeah. Yeah. He did. He looked a lot more butch and green. That was the piece colors. That's when he's out looking for a day. Oh, come on. Leave El Papa alone. Will you please? He had a rough time up there in Canada. You know, there's Canadian. He was very high in the Atlantic too. So I want to understand. Yeah. It was a rough day. He took off with silk first. He had to go to Canada where he'd have a reason for having a first crowd. Because nobody lives there. Nobody says, right. He's in the middle of, uh, I can't say where he was. We're over the heck you are. Well, Ludes and you're you love to try. You're never going back and I'm doing it. Go back and I'm sober. Well, good luck to you. Hey, it's a big mistake. It's another wedding. You can hang out at Bonnie Brook. I'm going to hang out at the embassy suite. I'm going to talk to Melvin the cook. He's going to make me some good breakfast over there on North West. And I'm going to have a good time with the big curtain. Good. He's great. Great. But you never went to greens. Why you went to a castle, uh, a place I can understand. They make good hamburger because it was right down the road and it was pouring. And I wasn't going to drive all over town to go get a greens hamburger. I had to go and what's happened. I did pass by top had on eight mile and liver. No, it'll make you very happy. But I didn't go in. Did you ever go see the movie? Stayed out a few about a month ago. I asked you to go see. I don't go to movies with Emilio Estevez. I'm starring. Okay. I won't go to see it. Go like people name Emilio. I just don't like Emilio Estevez. There's something wrong with him. In fact, I think you and he have been hanging out together. He's like he's like about a brick and a half short. Okay. How's the bird man treat you today? As usual, I've these questions. This guy has really got some questions. Would you like me to kiss a man? There's a question. No. All right. Well, then let's talk about the untimely death of Peter Tach. You know, there's stuff missing in the rack again here today. Like what? Like the Neorodges disease. Oh, I know what it is. Major came in. He said he he messed with all the labels again. Now I can find nothing. It's got a new label on it. Is all it does? Well, where the hell is it? Oh, Stan. This man. I'm telling you. The vein of my existence. There is no finding anything when he gets done. It's gone. It's just not in here. Okay. It's not in here. That's fair. Yeah, these are boy. Real problem. It's got to be there. Say what we call a major problem. And we come on and say we have made your problems today. That should give you a little clue. That's not in here. It's gone. A personal problem show like Steve. Yeah, I won't mention the last name. Oh, I saw about two minutes in him last night. He was out with another one of those contrived debates with Tomas Regalado on Channel 10. They were doing their usual pointless counterpointless. But like to see the Q and I'm not to see if they disagree. Now that we're talking about the Pope and abortion and some, you know, some dead topic. I don't know what it was. That card is gone. It has disappeared. The map and major is a dead man. Okay. The guy's probably found that show that you were talking about in the morning. And she Joey Joey Illuminum foil. Joey Reynolds. Yeah. He was very harsh on you today because somebody called up and told him his show to think and he started to and he had mentioned your name and he started to pick on you as it turns out that you're a homosexual. Yeah. Yeah. Pretty heavy news. It's a it was a shock. One thing about Joey man. He's the master of the understatement. Master of the obvious. Well, my cart is gone. So I'm going to just to turn this whole rack over during the news. Have a great life, sir. All right. Okay. It's gone. Oh, go look for it. The man comes in here and just can't stop playing with the cart. Okay. Every day. Every day. Every minute. Every moment. Every second. Trying to make him better. Like the right. Better. What he says. Another posth good. Niock messing with my life. Michael is here with some headline. CBS has the news. Minus the Liberty Mutual spot is 11 o'clock. And we'll come back at 11 o'clock. Just when you thought it was safe to go back to the radio, stand major. After noon two to six on 94 news wins. W. I. M. V. Miami Ford Latterdown. Good morning from the 94 news room. The legislature is back in session and no one is sure how long this session will last. Special session open this morning at nine. The schedule run scheduled for one. I should say for two days. But it might not be long enough to iron out all the arguments over consumer services tax in an effort. Alan Box was a normal man with a wife, children, a summer home in Opalaca, and a chain of radio stations. Well, normal that is until just three weeks ago. Hi, honey. How was your day? Unbelievable. There's nothing but subhuman do spags out there. Alan Box is suffering from Neal Rogers disease. Have you canceled the Miami Herald yet? That honey we don't subscribe to the Herald. Oh, no. That's a cop-up. What kind of a lame excuse is that? Just say no to L. Herald, sir. Huh? People afflicted with Neal Rogers disease have lost the ability to communicate like normal human beings. What's the matter with you? Blue hair don't bag from femoral pine. You know big gen pencils. I'm you know how can you say those nasty things running around stealing sweet and rough. I get you anything. How about those bad noise that went missing? You know it doesn't hurt to what? In the credible Neal Rogers disease of growing South Florida epidemic, please help us find a cure. Honey, it's Friday night. You know what that mean? Hey, you know what I got a nice a nine. What's we follow got three points on Facebook? Send your tax deductible contributions today in Kairov Hot 105. Permanent. Un-alatable. It's got a label with all the ACN stuff. You know, the blue of the man just doesn't understand. Okay. His intentions are good, but the end results. An unmitigated disaster. And I'm losing. I'm getting a little scratchy throat here this morning. I may be up for a few days, but you know, to where it goes. And then this Bob Markey, who is the publisher of another one of these great newspapers, the town cryer. Oh god. In West Palm Beach, Captain Jack and Sergeant Marky put on a good show. He talks about being a guest with Jack Cole and arguing about the Pope. And he says, so I listened to Cole, other talk host on W. J. And some weirdo on a Miami station make fun of Pope John Paul the second visit to area. And it rang my bell. Some weirdo on some Miami station. The widow's got no name. The station got no callators. And God forbid that Bob Markey, who's a, you know, a big time guy up there publisher of the town cryer. Because this is addressed to, I want to know one thing. I want to know where is our Jeff striker poster? I think it's a threatening, threatening, and threatening. And it still hasn't shown the island clean. He said he mailed it two years ago. So could I, you know, it never, oh, he said he mailed it two days. Help today's money? Yeah. What did you do? Just think it on the point he's back. This is the second one. I highly, all from the highly opposed office, but I don't ever get here. I think we know about those guys who work at the highly opposed office, all those macho birds. No way Jose, whatever arrive here. Okay. See if that's addressed to. Roger, so what's wrong with that? Now why would I get this be smell and my mail? Because it says the laughing jacket. And it's obvious that for you. Let me see that a minute. It's addressed to the laughing. Why actually open it yet? I wanted to hear how many of this is it. If I decide what opened it up immediately and he did on a year and it says, get out of town. You've managed to ruin the best talk show. How do you like that? Get, they told me you were laughing jackass. Why would they put that in mind? You in sippid iBus? Maybe we could have the down iBus show. There's a pot. Let's, let's fix some calls and just please go off into corner and play an egg or something. Will you? Broward County. Hello. How are you doing Neil? Okay. Great. I'm on new listener to your show. I just started listening about two weeks ago. Really? Yeah and I really like a lot. I've never listened to any radio before. Okay. But I was listening to your day during the week while I was at work. He had one guy on and was talking about, he was really knowledgeable about all the radio stations and the format of all the shows. I was wondering what his name was. Tom Jickins. Okay. Yeah. He was really good. He had a lot of great ideas and I want to really agree with what he said was, where do these people get the ideas for the shows? I'm some of these other stations. Like he talked about the one guy who came and talked about the car. Where do they get the ideas for this? Who's thought is that? It's their own fault. See, they would blame their producers because they all got producers that booked their guests. But anybody who's got his own show who allows a producer to book that kind of guests who got nobody to blame but himself. But when, of course, then, of course, you go beyond that and you blame the management for hiring board operators to do talk shows. All right. But what about the guy who was taking you kind of sympathize with the guy who's kind of between a rock and a hard place with if there's producer doesn't see that. What would you do if you couldn't do the type format you want to do with your rockers? Yeah. We definitely work. Of course. That's good. Okay. One of the things I wanted to happen at any moment, sir. People who are calling like the rat guy that you thought people 40 want to your news breaks. Yeah. That's that energy. I don't know what it has to be for anybody else. But it seems like he just gives none of the energy to have time to hear himself on the radio. Well, I'd say that's about 90 percent of the people who call. All right. Just want to hear the sound of their own voice on the radio. Right. Okay. All right. Neil, thank you very much and I really like your show. Okay. Thanks for the great call. Okay. Okay. Got a couple of Broward lines open. Now five, two, four, 9,400. But my pop at O Park press pass just arrived in the mail this morning. And my life has changed dramatically. So we also want to thank Mary Lou from Hylia who has sent little tiny ceramic cat to go with Stan's alligator. And the cat is looking at lunch right now aimed in your direction. So look out. Looks like a hungry pussy cat. Dave County good morning. Hello. Yes. Yes. Yes. Where's still there? Of course. Well, we have to be quiet. We couldn't get rid of him for love or money. Where's the purpose of you, they didn't connect us? Good question. That's a very good question. They public affairs show. They have to do public affairs every week. Well, I don't know they don't. Yeah. They told they don't. Well, I heard one would lead to that on the Kibba, Stan with his surface of their fork. He didn't even talk about him. Basically, he talked about his end of the week. That's what the show is. We talk about some events of the week. Yeah. You don't? I thought that you sent you that in the guess you spent with that talking about you know, when back to the thing as well, we started getting again the show. You can get anything out of the show. I really accept the fact that you guys got that that rocker five thing wrong. Baby. Yeah. We didn't play the original. I know. The original was about my post. Oh, yeah. Right. I see. Yeah. You're right. We couldn't find the original. So, I apologize for that. No problem. No problem at all. Well, it's supposed to be like a fun show. You know. Yeah. I had to follow that. You had your moments. And then at one point you mentioned the fact that you're going to talk about his career or whatever. You did better than that. Oh, I guess we ran out of time. We were having such a good time, you know. But it's supposed to be. It's a public affairs show, but we want it to be kind of a different public affairs show that it is listable and you have a good time with it. No, it was a bad system. I can have things with this purpose. What? Well, I have him on again. He's so out of fun to have. So, let me give you the offer to answer to your question. There is no purpose to that show. Okay. There is no purpose. Believe me. We were still trying to figure it out, sir. Yeah. All right. You got to take care. All right. You too. Good light. Excellent. Good color. Yeah. And right to the point. You best. I look over again from Fort Myers this morning. Copy of 16 magazine. Oh, boy. Oh, boy. With Kirk Cameron on the cover. Oh, my God. You're going to be okay. Now, here's someone who understands and active listener who understands this program sent this obviously. Okay. Just keep talking. That's all right. Oh, my God. It looks who's in the magazine. All over the place is he at ugly boy or is he a really ugly boy? I mean ugly. All those kids with those ugly pug mows is man. They look like they ran into one too many brick walls. River Phoenix. He's eligible. It's like six years old. He's eligible. Who's that? Let's cut that out. All wait a minute. Here he is again. Right next to Manudo. What kind of a disgusting magazine is this? What kind of a child molester would send this magazine to us? Holy cow. Hmm. I don't know. What's the other page? 14 and 87 boy. We got to go all the way to the back of the magazine. 87. I don't see him again. Oh, there he is. River Phoenix. He's about three years old. From your favorite movie, little clip and no, I'm not going to play that again. These are all little, simply disgusting kids with acne and smelly armpits. You know, let's cut it out. Let's get serious. Look at those lines now. All of a sudden, boy, do they want to speak to us today? Look at that. Now, there's one. What are you reaching for over there? Okay. Well, listen, you don't want to talk to us anymore. What do we just do? All of a sudden that, you know, constant, they all ran out to buy 16 magazine. I guess I have no idea. Can you believe that? Everything was going right along. And I'll look at this. Here's one for staying. I guess team magazine with all these young ladies with all the lipstick and to make up on way too much lipstick. Boy, is this your getting famous or what? There's another cassette for you. Why don't you people stop already with a cassette? Why don't you stop and they got a list of 8 million things that they want on a cassette? What are you going to stop? What is this? This is another dirty magazine? World gaming. Oh, yeah, winners. I've already seen this stupid magazine. When okay, there's that for the tape. This is getting to be ridiculous. All we got to do is play post office in hero care, spin the bottle, one of the other. People are just demanding and demanding and demanding and probably that woman that sends in about 14 envelopes every day. She's probably got at least three or four in here today, you know, just to start the week off. Yeah, get rid of it. Go away. Jump on a ceiling. It's 1118 at WINZ. The phones are frantically flashing now, but when we're doing a break, we'll decide if we want to continue talking to these people or not. They just don't seem to be really into what today. Do they? Do they? The bird has a dangling cord, ladies and gentlemen, it will come right back. I'm sitting with Bill Hayburn. What is their problem today? We'll just sit here and wait. There are two Broward lines still flashing. We'll wait for those to go out. They're now we're down to one and we'll just wait for them all to go out. Would you put those magazines away? I'm telling you, this bird has gotten me to the point. I'm just about ready to have a stroke in here. You know what I'm saying? Let's run. Put the mail away. Okay. Put it away. All right. What a discre. I think you better call you, Bill, back and tell them I was a good idea. Get Donald over here. At least he gets into the show. At least he's aware he's involved. He's not pawing and bigging and getting into the waste basket and being a professional yenta. They don't get mail like this. That's good. I can handle it. Trust me. No problem. No problem. Okay. He's even got majors mail open. No, no, no, no. I'm sure you do. Was this a drastic home? I didn't realize that. The teen magazine? He'll love it. He's going to be very happy. Okay. It's put away. All right. Is that better? Okay. And who plugged his mic back in? What happened? Did it just like a worm? Did it just kind of slide back into the receptacle again? You know, there's no one commented on my hoods for idea at all. No, not one come. No, they don't want to talk to us today again anyway. And I don't want to say that it's anybody else's fault. They're very, very surly today, very independent like a cat. One minute, they're all ringing the next minute. They're all out. It's like, you know, get to us right away. Now it's like those women who call staying and hang on for 10 seconds and they end their hang up. They're busy. Don't you understand? They're real busy. They're county. Hello. Yeah. See what I mean? Yeah, I get your point. They're real busy. Hello. Yeah. I might be talking to new Rogers. You're speaking to him, sir. Yeah. Yeah. I just was calling because I was listening last week to the local oil and the show and another station. Yeah. And I, I think the guy out the other station, the talk show holes was the public relation man for coroio. He did national women single question about all the problem that Joe coroio has called here. This man, you know, are you aware that coroio had three police and they're by the city watching his house? Yeah. Well, what about? What in the world could that possibly have to do with the show? Well, just have to talk about coroio. You know, he's a such a guy, you know. Yeah. Okay, sir. Royale, have a wonderful day. That's a guy going to start taking these calls again, giving it a real wicked mood by about 130 and become a suicide old by 145. No question about it. Howard County, hello. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You're speaking to him, sir. I'm speaking to him. It sure feels like it. It's a good. You know, the young lady, the other day, what you're talking about? Yeah. You're boy, it's sort of the big. You should tell her it's about four hours. Excellent. Very good, sir. Goodbye. Okay. Yeah. Are they good or are they good? I thought about that. They're very good at the time that I didn't even use that line. So what does that tell you? The how-and-tailed blue hairs. Look at that. Marie Jane and Dot. With lipstick all of the envelope. Looks like Sine Rosenberg shamed to me. I'm recognizing anywhere is sunny. Howard, hello. Let me try it one more time. Oh, Neil. Yeah. To go on. Are these people all like either deaf or brain dead today? What's going on today? No substance. Yeah, right. Is that your problem? I want to thank for the album. I won lastly. You're welcome. You did all having got it yet. At the bird-on strike or what? They were sent out the day you wanted. I heard a collar calling you Saturday thanking me for it. Yeah. Like the Montnell box and then wasn't there. You've gotten Neil today already? Hello? Yeah. Oh, I don't know. No, he hasn't got his mail yet today. It'll probably be there today, but you know he just is nervous. He's nervous. Very. There was Sineau. No problem. All right. Well, I hope you enjoy it. Well, I hope I do too. If it ever shows up. That's right. Okay. Thank you. You bet you. Bye bye. Hello. Thanks for your order for the great reputation contest.

I've been caught the other day to court hearing and they have a guy in the jury's office who's on charges for grand theft and what he had done was he had good read the novel calls out the David and he had the stuff for stakes from WIndixia down his hand and then tried to flee the store. Well, the security manager caught him and packed all the mouth by the store and they found the fake Miss pants and the judge started laughing like crazy because after he read that he said that they took the stakes out and put him back right back in the freezer.

Where does he play what position? Not tight end. Center. Center field. Of course. This is course Larry. Good. So he knew what he was just a little incomplete. Like most of most of those passes that got a Gary Huggable. I got it. By the way, that Gary Huggable now. There's a pretty interesting quarterback for the Indian App. What are you laughing about? It's laughing at me. Well, when he took his helmet off there to the end of the game, I said, I didn't you play the whole game without that. I played a lot more attention. Great. Since he left the Cowboys, he's looking a lot better. I'll tell you that. And Danny White, by the way, talking about aging badly, Danny White looks like he's about Joey Reynolds, age. I'll leave him about 60. Not that much. I'm a serious boy. He is really aging rapidly. I guess if you played for Tom Landry, you would do. But boy. Yeah. Now, I'm talking about his face. I mean, he looks like he's been through World War 7 or something. He used to be a good looking guy, Danny White, about like a couple of years ago. And he looks like how he just aged and wrinkled and battered. And, uh, oh, gosh. Dreadful. He's getting to look like Gary Lawrence. I just say that in passing. Gary is in the building today. And we want to let him know that we're aware that he's here with us. You with us? Yeah. Far away Guinness. Far as I know. Is he going to be in the Guinness Book of Rectives for what? That's the Queen. So swift. This guy I'm telling you, this bird is about a swift as molasses on a bad day. Or every part of his body is injured really. Danny White from head to toe, from stem to stern, inside and out. Mm. Donald, uh, tomorrow morning about 945. Hello. Hello. Yes. Hi. This is talking to Neil. Yes, sir. Okay. I have a question, Neil. About 10 days ago when I saw you on, uh, choosing him your Hawaiian shirt. And as a cam of pull back, uh, so the across the desk was a slightly dope. Followed with a fringe around his, uh, sort of a ball. Was that please? Is that the bird? Oh yeah. Good one. Yeah. The story with the fringe on top. Or as we call him the sorry with the fringe on top. You just put it out of my mouth. Yeah. Well, I wanted a description. Yeah. An nerd with the fringe. Do you want to give us that again? But no, don't give it to us again. I'll just ignore him, sir. Pay no attention. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Put a call. Or your behavior today is just absolutely unconscionable. How do I know what unconscionable? What's wrong? What? Why do you think it would be much easier to ask what's right? Between you and these pullers. Okay. So like some kind of punishment. It's like the programming department set this up ahead of time. I want to tape a very show in here. I want to take get the rich in here to double tape of what's going on in the programming office. Howard County good morning. Yeah. You doing Neil? Well, it doesn't sound like that. I know. I know. Just really bizarre here today, sir. Yeah. Well, I just wanted to call up. Nobody's really called up. mentioned. I don't know if these people are unaware. But Jaco Pastaurius was hospitalized. What was about? A week and a half ago? Who? Jaco Pastaurius about the greatest base plan in the world. He played for webtoe report. Have you ever heard anything by them? Jaco Pastaurius. I know he's a local jazz musician. Well, he was local and he would have been around a few years back. What is this? The suit hour now? What suit hour? What do you mean? I don't have any idea who you're talking about. I do. He made it in for a window. So I guess he's a suit. Do any of you? I really do. I just wanted to say, you know, any place with higher advantage, you're like that guy Luke that beats the living hell out of a drunk in musician. You know, ought to be nominated for the rambo the year award. So I had just for any other colors that appreciate music and appreciate art. I just wanted to, you know, don't try to understand that don't sir. Don't you understand that Daffy hasn't been here for over three months now? It was Daffy. Yeah. Well, this story must have really been high stuff. I haven't heard a thing about it. Yeah. Yeah. You know, that's kind of thing. It's not the man who just by story. They put a red shirt on the guy with his money, grandmothers. Who cares? Who cares? I mean, you might as well be talking about professional wrestling for all I know. Oh, I thought I thought maybe you knew something about, you know, I don't know anything about anything, sir. Yeah. Well, maybe the. Okay. Okay. Meal. Fine. Good luck, Mr. Have a wonderful life and don't ever call this a okay. But I almost said ball bust your luck can't say. They county. Hello. Yes, hi. Hi. Yes. Yes. I was curious to see I was right. I knew this was going to be a great call. Go ahead. We haven't ace anybody from the show. Sir, we just tried to get him to cool it. That's all. Well, I thought he was kind of clever. It was kind of clever once in a while, but he was getting to the point of being a chronic regular. That's on the, and not only that, but he was watering down his material at the point that were days he was calling when he was not funny. I don't know what I'm saying. Yeah. How much of a good thing? I'm telling you over exposure like in Alaska. Over exposure is a sure way to, you know, why do you do that? No one should get off stage. Right. Okay. Just curious to let him back out eventually. Oh, yeah. He has been on he called here a couple of days ago. Okay. I mean, are you going through withdrawal symptoms, sir? No, no, no. He'll be he'll be around. I believe me. I'd also just curious to see what the story was like. Exactly. Did you get rid of him? You already told me. I thought we just went to a place. I thought you were about to have his one specific incident. I thought that brought it down. No. Are you understanding, Mr? I mean, didn't I? Did we just have an interesting conversation about a brief one, but did I just answer the question you had seen to me that you responded in such a way as the indicator you understood in the answer? I know. And now all of a sudden I'll be clear, but well, why exactly did you, um, I agree that he was getting boring. Yeah. I thought there was something else. No, that was it. That's all there was. It's a great nothing sinister, nothing hidden. We don't have to monitor your loggerate. That's all that believe me, sir. Okay. Do you believe me? I got it. Okay. Thanks. Boy, feel like I'm not. Where's Judge Lopner when we need him? You know? I come on trial here. Why exactly did you get that call or off? And when did you do it? And what did he say? And what was the date? What was the time? Well, we don't know, but as long as Richard Dr. Lopter has a few days in longer days. Check him out. Boy, this is getting to be like an inquisition. One almost would suspect that the Pope is still in the country. Now it's like an inquisition here today. God Almighty. Broward. Hello. Yeah. You got father. Well, how you doing? Listen, you're not to put up with all this crap. I'm not alone island. I'll make you a couple of James. That's your venture to work with you in some, you know, like you little butt. Now you still there. What what? Okay. There he goes. Probably figured the CIA tap was on him just to flew away. flew away. Never to be seen again. Probably wound up in your nest at the end of the day. Boy, this I'm telling you this show is getting the point of just draining like a draining experience. I went to bed last night. The earliest I've gone to bed in years quarter to 10. Good. Law. And I slept till 8 o'clock this morning. Well, see, realize how long that is? Well, you needed it. Obviously. You're probably. Oh, my mind needed it. And my brain. Yeah. And now here it is Monday again. See, it's those six day weeks. I keep telling you. I hope that he's going to listen to that half hour again from Saturday. It just might, you know, a peer-saved dense mind that I mentioned about working six days again, unacceptable, unconscionable, cruel and unusual punishment, not accepted in the industry, even the Shlobs on the FM. Card up a bunch of crap and they put it on, you know, and pay, they don't show up. They're not going to get up six days to come in here. Even guys who are desperate for a job. What is that? Tell you. Okay. Let's take one from Brown. Hello. Welcome to WIOD. Happy. WIOD. See, we caught your off guard. Welcome to W snooze. Good morning. I'd like to order breadcrumbs. What can we get for you, sir? Scrambled eggs raw. Mm-hmm. That should be good for the week. Well, it's a good time for the great taste. Excellent. You got your stuff? Never. Good one. Is that it? That's it. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Be right over in about ten minutes. You're going to be delivering today? Mm-hmm. You're flying right over to them. You bet. Or this is so good. Well, there's you know that the Zeta people ate up all the good food from the machine this morning. They did. And your good friend Dave Caprizi was reading the labels of all at mong on the year. Any well? Yeah. No wonder you what a performance is morning. See, I see out all fit together now. This is all I'm left with. It's an Italian mong sandwich. That's all that's in there. They just cleaned the whole machine up. It says the bird has yet to place the real all from Saturday for God to replace it. I forgot. Yeah, you have a little something to do, right? Good sour. Good. I'll be done this hour. Go do it. I will do it. Dave County, hello. Is this another one of those tinklers? Wow, it's hello. Dave County, hello. Yeah, Neil, you're on? No. Okay. This might be considered another call for today, but I was really in favor about them still playing the scats to run the scat players. Hold on, the strike. Yeah. Are you going to just let that ride and not touch that? Demand make a comment about that earlier in the journey of the show. Oh, sorry. I had it. I might have missed that. Now, we'll be glad to get it off the longer tape for you because we're working very hard on longer tapes today. I'd like to, I'd like to take a tape for him in the building today, sir. We're just waving everything. Like the shows from the first to the 12 just to review. Yeah. Okay, no problem. Tell Richard when he comes back in there. No problem. Anybody watching tapes? Fine. Then they can hassle me over and you know, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Come to those come tight out or just you have to do your own transcript. After that you own transcript, sir. Yeah, a little work. You have to go out and buy your own longer machine, as a matter of fact. I thought cost about 10,000. You know, but the, uh, Collabs, they said, they'll send you one over. They got all much as fair as any piece of equipment that's ever been invented. They got about five or six just hanging around up there. Well, that's because that's been good on that money. You got it. All those spots, all those big numbers. You are going to, I was just wondering, are you intend to get more involved with that? Because you're figuring what a cost you to go to a game at the stadium and they're going to be able to intend to get involved with what? With these mung brains that are walking out, no, I'm not going to get involved. I'm just counting my blessings. I'm delighted. I'm delirious. You have no idea how pleased I am. For the mung brains that we go watch a game for $26 a pick up. Yes, so they could subsidize all these good loyal players. All right. Yeah. All right. Just the thoughts. I said you want to Monday. Screw them. All right. Well, it might be enjoyable. Well, maybe on a Tuesday. See you later. Okay. By the way, they didn't waste any time. They must be awfully desperate with that Uncle Banzai concert at the colony theater. This Saturday, September 26 8 PM. You're like, stand. Mobile. We have to have a call from a mobile phone today. They're having, you know, it's good they have to let them ring and they charge. That's the reason. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, tenets. About five pairs. Just about close more or less five pair of tickets for the Uncle Banzai concert at the colony theater, Miami Beach. One of America's great theaters at 1040 Lincoln Road. Just a block East of Altman between 15th and 16th streets for those of you who are taking down directions. That's correct. Is that great? Real escape salesman is the opening act. Uncle Banzai on focused acoustic music Saturdays 2 to 5 on WLRM. Yeah, the guy in LRN even took a shot at me the other day. I was told by a sued. No. Yep. Yep. Now, what is this football selection is called the bird. 976 tops. When would sports select your 250 per call? Should we call it on here? Okay, let's take a break. When we come back, we can make the bird two and a half bucks. And you may have to finish the show by the way. Let's go to a Broward County, hello. Uh-huh, hello. Yes. And Neil? Yes. Oh, I'm off. We have to cook to you. I'll bet. I'm a little lady. I'm a lady and my husband's 85 and we're both blind. You're special. Hello, Neil. Yes, May. And now for three days now, ever since I heard about you giving out the records and the one in particular that I was interested in would be the Neil the Elvis. But I couldn't get you there. I tried to get you a three day. But now I've got you and I want to wish you a lot of luck. Thank you and I'll stand you. A day down. Hello. And on the eye. Okay. Boy, who's a heck was that the glossary? Absolutely awful. Yeah, I know. I think they're coming from inside the building. He's an cracker anyway. Um, he's the topic. Uh-huh. What's the subject? I know we're not by the way giving these tickets away until tomorrow. So, any free loaders out there that are calling for the tickets? Got a home. My free load experience from up in New Jersey, it came down here. Hi, Vinnie and so. And I told him this is the Neil Rockies. It's a great choice. Got a pop-up up and oh my god, this is like, monk's city. I was like, like, this one for instance. But I don't know what's what is happening over here. You used to have a subject matter that he's a carrier before whether it was a pick and on the old ladies or pick and on a pick or whatever it is. Yeah. You know, in essence, really, what is the topic and what can we talk about? What is what is the, what is the, the quality supposed to be the show now? Because we're waiting for you Neil to throw something out of the sun and we can get involved with. I got news for you. I could throw a wet dish rag at this audience and it would make a bit of difference. Okay, I said down here and I went through the MAs and the football strike and about, I don't know how many other things we talked about. It doesn't make any difference what I talk about because they're not interested in what I talk about. Okay, they don't care. They don't care. I had an extraordinary number of little notes at the bottom of the log that I usually don't even talk about Heather Lockleer Courtney Kyle. Which is all these wonderful, macho guys out there. They have nothing to say. They're busy. They're otherwise occupied now. Well, they didn't, they told me that, um, um, what's this out there? How are the sternons in New York? It's really bombing out now. I mean, it's not always not who told you that? He's friends of mine from, uh, well, maybe he's that's his opinion. Oh, they're out of their mind. He's not bombing. I'd he dropped like about a third of a point or something. He's not bombing. You should be bombing like he's bombing. I know I'm bombing right now myself. Well, I didn't say that. You did. Of course it's true, but anywhere where I don't know. It's just sounds like the show is dragging along over here and we don't want to do it. We're in a lot. What do you mean it's dragging along? I don't know. It's almost 1230 already. I know, but, uh, and before you know, it'll be too close. It'll be up front of the general manager's office rearranging his furniture and throwing things and it'll be business usual. You know, okay. Well, uh, I mean, you know, we're doing the best we can underderrest. They're harassing us here and they're creating a lot of mischief in the program trying to give me to we don't walk out or something and they're working on it. They're getting very close. They're hard-assing you. For the, exactly. They're giving us our rough time. They're just creating a poor up a pattern of hard-ass. And what's here is those idiots going strike all those football players. Of course, who gives a damn about that, right? I mean nobody. Let them go on strike. I mean, the one that won $1,000 a year now. Yeah, they're uh, they're owning half of the world now with their salaries. Let them all go to hell. You know, it's all like Mickey Mouse anyway. It's all minor league. I mean, here that cowboys with hercial walker and Tony Dorset and the same backfield, and they look like a sandlot team, okay? So who needs, who needs the NFL? It's watered down to the point. It's like Tony League football. They should bring up like Darrell Hall ought to be playing for the cowboys. National League presentation contest. That'll be great. I watch that. Yeah. They can do another one of those contrived things like they did with the arm, the Indian wrestling, and the slam dunk, get all that other stupidishos. What great talent they've got. Right. You know, damn, dunk, uh, Indian. Yeah, they can see who does the best ivory soapspot. I don't think anybody can beat Steve Lardjum, but you know, they're working on it. Keep it for. Yeah. So and okay. Wonderful life. Okay. Sure, we move along. Should we take our lives in our hands? I guess sounds like some of the people in the audience already have. Broward. Hello. Yes, Neil. Yeah. Love you, show. I know. It's great. Well, better listen real fast, sir. But that you better listen real fast. Not on it. I don't know if the air can. A minute could be the last. Because if you won't go up here. There's like there's like a cloud hanging over it inside the building. You know what I mean? Like a dark cloud hanging over this program. One question. Yes. That cloud raining. Be it any minute. I'm big trouble. Yeah. Any minute. In fact, Brian North Cross is going to call and give the uh, give the atmospheric conditions inside the building a little later on. Well, listen, your shallow city. Million times I don't know that. Did you tell me, Rhino? I happened to have the unfortunate lock of catching his show this morning. Well, I've, I've stopped doing that. And it's pure for you know, or you have. And he has the nerve to find no problem as long as he pronounces it right, even my real name. I wish he pronounces it right. But the guy's desperate, you know, even his combacks are so weak. They really are. So weak. He should, his picture should be in the dictionary for soft work. Yeah. Anyway, how about going to the time tunnel? No. No. No way. Finally, okay. We've had another enough sound effects already today to last a lifetime. Okay. Jackie. Anyway, listen, keep up the good work. Okay, sir. Please, must you go on that man's show that follows you. Now, here he goes with the shot. It's a why. What did he ever do to you? He did nothing to me. But I'm really, maybe that's a problem. He just, he's just not funny. I'm sorry, sorry. That's not what they say at the ice cream store. Well, that's probably only two. They take one look at Stan and they're rolling on the ground, holding their son. That's a thing. That might be maybe he needs to go and come on. Now, be nice. Okay. Be nice. He's sensitive. Yes? Very sensitive guy. He doesn't like anything, but he's very sensitive. Okay. I just say one thing. Please, it's not time. I'll tell you on the shot, be in Hollywood. That's a good message. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot, Neil. I'll read it. No personal messages, ladies and gentlemen. It's against FCC regulation. That's true. And you'll get me in big trouble with all these personal messages, especially to Mr. Sharpe, say violation of FCC law. That's right. And they're just all sitting out there in the atrium waiting for us to do something wrong. You know, they're just itching, just waiting for the opportunity to come flying in here. Okay. That's it, bud. You'll have it. But you might write. Yeah, but, but, but, I think we're going to take another break right now, you know? Well, I think we'll do it just out of spite. I just out of spite. And if it sounds in, you know, the minutes to come, I don't want to say days to come because we don't work that far ahead. I'm going to show we never plan ahead anymore. True. But if in the minutes to come, it sounds like I'm getting mean, nasty and spiteful. You're right. Other than that, raw to the, uh, tender box, you know, what does he want? And the answer according to Kyle is what he can't get. Yeah. Oh, try. Never were true or were it spoken. Howard County, good afternoon. Welcome to WNWS. All right. Yes. Yeah. Welcome to joy 10107. Do we want to 7? Yeah. What can we play for you, sir? Maybe a little amount of money today. Oh, I'm hearing like a delayed reaction on myself on the radio. I know. Well, when you call this show, there's always a delay reaction. This is something fun, by no. Um, you sound like you're about radio say uncle, but that's about it. You know, I wanted to ask you, uh, what is going to be the situation here with these golf and tickets is, is Scott football does come to the J. R. Estenium. Well, what you see is what you get. That's it. That's it. That's what we're paying for. Do you think that Joe Robby's going to give you a refund? No, I guess not. No way Jose. It's called screw the fans. All right. Do they get refunds on if the strike is total in a game's aren't played? Did they get a refund? We don't think it's been decided yet. We don't know. Probably not. Oh, boy.

During his cell, SOJ, OURM. Oh, sunny, sunny. What have we done to deserve this? Let me take. Oh, there is sunny. What do you reason why it knows what it means is because it's a name of the seventh movie, Blue's up. I can call out desperate I am that I'm leaving sunny on. Have you noticed that I had even, I haven't even got my figure near the button. How you doing, Sunny? Well, I don't. Let's put the call. If I did anyway. How come your sound so you can go and go here and play, Sunny? Well, because you're drunk, Joe. Don't stand the old pony. He's got nothing better. At least you're funny when you put somebody down. Did you know that Joey Reynolds is a homo sapienne? What is his, what is his, his, his, his last name, or what? Yeah, Joseph A. Pinto as in that great Ford car, you know? Well, I would have been better in Reynolds. I think is that well, I think Edso would have been a better name for him. You know, why he chose a name Reynolds? Why is that, Sunny? So he made him prove his rap. Oh, I thought he was playing heavy metal. Oh, boy. So what's up, Sunny? Is that it? I'm not talking to you. Oh, I'm sorry. I apologize. He's all take it all back. He's all right. I wasn't hanging up because you're under about me, but I don't want to be rude. No, don't do that. You got a lot of your listeners will listen to the show. You do realize that, don't you? Yeah, heard that. Paul, you know that. Yeah, you got it. Did you? You were monitoring us? No, someone did it for me. Okay. I thank you one of the Paul, Sunny. Yeah, I don't want to Paul. No, you won. I think. Yeah, I think so. I think Tanner called it a couple of times devoted for you. I just told him because you're right, but this is a desperate show and I love it. Okay, well, it's a desperate town. Have you seen this town lately? No, I said it's just a bit of a... I don't blame you. I don't blame you. Well, listen, Sunny, have a wonderful life and say how to grandma boom. Thanks, Bill. Okay. See, we were so desperate. We'll even let Sunny Fox on today, boy. That's desperate. I like Sunny. I've come around on him. Are you not happy? No. He's okay. He's a good guy. He's got a great girl. At least he's funny. Yeah, okay, and Tanner's funny. Yeah. And the guys on how one-of-five are they have their moments? But boy, other than that. Yeah. Other than that. We haven't given this guy any your time today. He's going to get upset. It's a good time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Boy, that great taste. Yeah, he's a good guy now. He's all right now. Poor Donald boy. Another thick. He and Greg are in heat with each other. 14 to 11 at WINZ. We apologize for the be-entempered behavior of the audience on his program, but don't blame me. They're all getting excited because they all are hungry for ice cream again, you know? Disgusting. What a display of pedophilia. I've never seen anything like it in my- Did you see the expression on his face? Well, of that word. I saw one of Phoebe's hair is just come out of the right corner of his lip. I can't believe. Yeah, we really hit a nerve with a wrong ear. By the way, have you ever seen a bird? I mean, somewhere they must have something, you know? Way up inside those feathers there. That's the wrong nerve. I think we just hit. Yeah, thanks. Oh, I want to look when I said pedophilia. Oh, like a little too close to home. Can you hear your proud stick correct? Yes, I did. Well, I'd like me. Yeah. Well, you get too nervous to say it. Because it strikes a little too close to the bone. I never hear a stand say that word. Well, he just thinks that he doesn't say it. Wait till he sees that magazine boy. He is going to freak out. I know. Teen magazine. Oh, he's got to be in heaven. So anyway, all you pedophiles, all you pedaress cut the crap. Well, you'll please and leave my good friends alone up there at the ice cream store. You can go in. You can buy ice cream. You can look. You can dream. You can fantasize, but don't touch period, right? Now when I go up there, okay, let's go to a brown county. Hello, brown. Oh, I knew it. It's still good to be true. We had time. But not today. We only did. We did your down left. I'm looking through you. Why don't you let me be right? I don't have a last few days of the period of the night. I'm looking through you. Why did you go? I thought I knew you. What did I know? You don't have to be friends, but you have changed. I'm looking through you. You love the baby. Yeah, I'm looking through you. It's a good time for the great taste. The old this is not a reminder you that it's always a good time for the great taste. Okay. Sick. Real sick. What have you gotten more little prepubescent children? Now wait a minute. What is this? The green guy contest? Can I enter this? How come you work? And most of the kids are very ugly. Ugly. I mean, yeah, serious. As one kid here from Ripley, Tennessee, looks like a girl. And as kid from Plainville, Kansas, he looks like Fran talking in with a broken nose. Lot of very ugly kids in here. Although John's truck from Chico, California, I think the obvious question is, has John been struck? Maybe that's the October semi finalist for teen magazine, the dream guy contest. And obviously whoever picked these kids has the same taste as Dan Major, they're all ugly. Okay, let's go back to the calls to some of these people have been waiting for a lifetime. And I bet you some of these are Ripley orders. Broward County, welcome to WINZ. How you doing? Okay. How you doing Neil? Pretty good. I also want to talk today. You ended at that time? Are you in an echo chamber, sir? No, I'm speaking out of both. But it fooled me. Could have pulled you, eh? You're on a speaker phone, sir. But, uh, but, uh, what do you think about the two blow this year? You're just gonna win. And what about the empaudres? This is a real good this year, I think. Hey, listen, don't knock the pod raise man. They're gonna slip right by the Dodgers and the Braves like lightning. No, no, no, yeah, I bet this leads to red to dice and the answer. Now I'm looking forward to maybe a pod raise mayor and his work series. Yeah, that sounds good to me. Or maybe the pod raise in the Texas Rangers? Yeah, that could be true too. So, uh, what do it say? If the football season's over with, the one that I mean basketballs would be tried as long as you're maybe the pirates in the Indians. That could be true, too. Or the pirates in the Toronto Maple leaves. Yeah, it's a good time. Yeah. So, no, if you like the way the edges are Detroit. Are you what do you mean the Yankees? Is this man in a dream world? I know the edges are out of this. Finished. Let's hear it. The George Steinbrenner, all right. How you doing, on the other folks? Okay. I like the stuff that the between you and Gwen and the Brick of the Maria. Yeah, you notice how it sounded so much better. You know why? Because we cut it in the FM production studio. Really? And then they get nervous when you walk over the door. Oh, real nervous. Understatement. Really? Understood. But, may I sit on it's question? Okay, ask me an honest question. You have a, if you're getting hi-radius. And I'll give you like dishonest answer. Why do I, why does the, the other end of the building always get no hassle and you always get all the hassle? Because they love the FM and don't understand that they're brain child. It's there. It's like they're baby. Okay. And if you had a baby, did you see the movie? It's alive? No, I didn't. Okay. Well, at any rate, the story, you know, the woman had this disgusting grotesque monster baby with claws. It looked like something you'd get a baby, no-in-win crab house, you know. And anyway, in the end, when they were about to destroy it, her instincts were such you wanted to save it because it was her baby. Okay? I see everything that goes on here, I've done contrary to what they've told me to do. In other words, if they tell me, don't do this. I go ahead and do it because I know exactly because I know that their instincts are all about that. What the address? The word is located. Is he gonna let me finish that story? He just, the only reason you called, because you're, come on, the only reason you called is because you want to go up there and rub your elbows with the ice cream kids. Isn't that it? Come on. I know your type. You're not admitted. You're a peterist. What? Peterist? I'm gonna go, I'm not tired. You want to go and look and Brian and Joshua, right? No, not Susette. Susette. Oh, okay. Is that yet by one of the 10? You're one of those 10 straight guys. Yeah. What can I say? You know, you could have fooled me. Go for a few words, it's like, anyways. So on the university, we're giving them a lot of free publicity and we're giving nothing out of it. I'm getting absolutely, I don't even get a little note. Stand of these guys. No, I'm not. Just a little friendship, you know. Okay. And whatever else. Come on. It's on university drive in Latter Hill. It's just north of Oakland Park Boulevard. North of Oakland Park. The East on the other side of the little shopping center there. Little strip shopping center. In fact, there's a big strip shopping center. There's a crab, a Maryland crab house or something which is horrendous. Just off of the Vatican. And just what? Just off of the Vatican. No, it's not anywhere near Benagans. No, no, it's north of there. Oh, God, this guy I'm going to such a hard burn. Oh, David, I'd be on the other side. It's north of there. I know where you're talking about now. Okay. Hey, thank you. There's a there's a sporting good, Lombardo sporting goods. Okay. Whatever the hell it is. Well, if and maybe the uh, it was the bullet we played by next table and maybe we can have basketball play off the football next summer. Maybe Brian and Joshua can play in the Super Bowl. We'll see. It's that she can be the cherry on top of the ice cream. No, okay. Well, listen, you get up there and let me know how it all made out. Definitely. Okay. Bye. Hopefully, if any guy who's on a speaker phone pretending to be in two suzette. Maybe into crates. Suzette. Okay. We want to thank Rich Pactor for the Brian Adams and the Danny Wilson L. P. He says he's going to be sending some mojo men CD. This is a mojo man. I mean, mojo nicks. Mojo man. What was the record by the mojo man? You're the dead there. Oh, they had a big record. I know. I'll think of it. Oh, Mr. Records. Here we go. Mr. Music is putting his lip to his brain. Well, I was a you know, mojo man. The mojo man. Oh, not like incense and peppermint. That's a very long car. But it was like that. Yeah. The mojo man. Game of love by the mind vendor. Mind vendors. Okay. At least I'm in the ends. A groovy kind of love with the mind vendors. The game of love was by not the mojo man. No, wasn't. Oh, he started us on one of these. You never come back from this. It's hope you're hurting my head. Oh, I had a hurt. I had to think of that. The mojo and july at by reflection. The reflection is very good. Excellent. I'm in game of love by. This is like trivial. True. True. You've sort of like build a quick show. Right. Profit in Friday on my mind by easy beats. Right. I got Friday on my mind. One of my favorite. The mojo man. Anyway, any over some mojo. And then skid rope or skid row CDs will give them away whenever they come in. And tomorrow will give away these tickets. Because lately we may give it a lot of stuff away. Yeah. You know, that's where we are lately. We figure it's like time to clean up clean out the shelves and clean out our desk and everything ready to leave. And this so we're giving a lot of stuff away. If they have a few bureaucrats we're going to be giving away on Wednesday, tune in for that. You don't want to miss it. Broward County. Hello. Okay. This is your big chance and you're blowing it. Okay. It's your big. Okay. How do you go? Hello. Hello. Broward County. Yes. Oh, boy. Are they good or what? Grace? Who don't they get on the air? They come psychotic. That's Broward for you. The mojo man. Wait a minute. No, that's no fear. You're going to look it up. Give me that book. Drive me crazy. Give me that book. What a disgrace. That was going to cheat. Mr. Records. Okay. All right. In 1961, Roger Maris had 61 homerons. Yeah. Who had 54 homerons in 1961? Mickey Mappell. Oh. Is that right? That right. Wild guess. Is it right? How in the world did you know that? I told no. I'm incredible at Trivial pursuit. I have a head full of completely useless information. Yeah. And I just those things. I don't even know where they come from. They just like come out of my mouth. You know, answers like that or somewhere. Yeah. And when I play Trivial pursuit, everyone wants me on their team. It's true. Kyle's like the two. He's got a head full of useless information also. More than me. No matter of fact. It was the right answer. That's what we covered yet. You're in shock. No, I would have expected him to say Joe Demagio or a babe Ruth, you know, or Lou Gehrick. I happened to know a lot of impermanent. Yeah. And I don't know why. I have no idea why, but I can't come up with maybe the module man at 54. This will pop into my head. By the way, before the hours over, I guarantee it. Mickey Andre Dawson leads the National League in home runs in my right with 44 of this current to my right. Second in the National League with 41. I don't know. Is this current? Yeah. I don't have a clue. No idea. He plays right field for the Atlanta Braves. He does milk commercials on WTS. Or you know that you'll know it. You don't have to put it on the screen. I don't know. I honestly don't know. He looks like God and plays like nice and good. You don't know Dale Murphy. Never heard that name. I have heard the name. If I said Robin Murphy. Now, if I said Declan Murphy, now, if I said Bob Murphy does the meds games on radio that he also doesn't add for the sporting news and he does milk spots and God when he takes his cap off I have to shut off my eyes like a very nervous. Okay, we'll look up the module man. We'll take a break here when we come back for, you know, talks some more to these misfits on the air. And they have been watching it when your best collar is sunny fog. That's a very good heavy comment on the show. Go, go, go, go. Go, go, go, go, go, go. This is Jerry Liner. Jerry Liner is a great amount of me. I mean, he did. Said and, you know, or a million dollars even Jerry's 358 bagged them wouldn't have done it. Or even his 357 bagged them. Our gun expert. What he knows about music. Now, there is something pretty interesting in his book. Yeah. Oh, I heard a record of the other day. I couldn't believe it on an unmanned jacket. I couldn't believe it. Chris Montez and the more I see. Oh boy. Now he had two hit record. The first was let's dance, which was okay. Not great, but pretty good. But the more I see you, great. But more I see you. Okay. So I did just like Michael Jackson. Now, if you ever seen Chris Montez and Michael Jackson together, never, never believe me. But my see you. And the whole record is like, off, keep you remember that right? Oh, oh, oh, yeah. Holy, holy Toledo. But anyway, this, why album here is pretty strange, Danny Wilson, there must be some reason that was said. I don't know what it would be. Denise to play quarterback. Oh, go, go, go, go, go. Not Danny Wilson. But anyway, Danny Wilson are. See, you always know there's something wrong because it says Danny Wilson are, right? It's a group, which is kind of like soldier. Mm. Gary Clark, Gerard Grimes, Kit Clark, with Lester Bois, Brass Fantasy, and David Palmer, Knills, Tuxen, Allen McGloan, and just like 8 million names on here. Yeah, it's a group. And Jeff Doug Moore, that sounds like a porno actor. Jeff Doug Moore. So anyway, it might be pretty interesting and that of course we've got the Brian Adams and the Heads of the Night. Excellent. Not like that Brian Fairy crap like fan place. Hmm. If he plays that one record, how does that over? It's in your old God. Oh, and the other reason he plays it is because smoke gets in his throat all during the show. Mobile. Oh, okay. Let's go to the, Dave County, relax. Will you please? Hello. Yeah, what's up? Okay. What's up? That's the definitive question, sir. Yeah, I just had to get in a comment. And if we ever find it, boy, are we in big trouble? Well, we can all hunt. Listen, you think the end cause you're out of it, huh? You never believe that Sean Cassidy and very manalow are on facing pictures in this book we got. The number one hits of billboard. Sean Cassidy and very manalow together in stereo. The Yankees are finished, sir. Don't you understand that? I did. I think they're almost mathematically out already. I heard New York fans come on. How about those giants? I went to that to start. Maybe I went to after the next six weeks, who knows who knows. And how about those met yesterday, huh? Well, I can't say that. What a joke, Java. Mr Steinberg is in a view. He feels that he is not taken an active part because when he stopped taking an active part, they were four games ahead. Yeah. And now he says, we're doing some changes in midseason. You know what his philosophy is? Right. Mess with success. Listen, you have been doing the ungame next year. No. Not at all. No, Channel 10's got all the UM sports locked up. So I'm out again, you know. That's a shame. In again, out again. I thought you'd have find Java. I appreciate that. I thought so too. I think you got the good work. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. I think I'm going to have you over. No. Here's the weather for the hurricane. That's all, Dean. So we have plenty of prizes a second time. You realize six years I've been you of M. Baseball in both times now. They've stuck it to me. Right in the back a little stools. Which I'm used to, my, my back looks like Swiss cheese. I got more holes in my back in this time. One over here for MedCon. Several over here from our killin. A lot of oil these in this time, but I really stick by you. Hmm. In fact, this town ought to have a theme song. This is the definitive theme song for oil these in South Florida. I bet you if we were doing that show on the FM, you'd want me to do the talk up on this. And I would step all over it and we'd all be real embarrassed. Okay. That's enough of that. I don't want to get carried away. You'll pull out the river Phoenix pictures again. With all the lines going here, you'll destroy the tempo of the whole show. What do we do? Tim is up there now. It is diet soda and everything. What are we done? To deserve your presence in the control room. And we done something right. Watch him say no. Yeah. What is it? I mean, we feel like we've done something so evil and so almost unspeakable, haven't we? Well. Okay. Don't worry. We'll get back to Medioperty again and then everything will be okay. I have to think of a calm down. Okay. Let's take some calls from Broward because when it comes to Medioperty. Hello. Hi, Neil. Hey, how you doing? Okay. I just wanted to thank you for the album. I received the Saturday. What a beautiful voice. Oh, thank you. Doesn't she have a beautiful voice? Thank you. I'd like the little Gickle. You mean, all these people got their albums on Saturday except that one guy that cold earlier who hasn't gotten it. Now we don't want to make him nervous, but if he didn't get it by Saturday, I would see his mind Saturday. Now which one did you get? Elvis is everywhere. Wow. Yeah. In stereo. Yeah. Yeah. That's a very nice. Great. Well, thank you, Neil. Well, that is nice call. Yes. I mean, you just called the thank us. I just called the thank you. That was really thoughtful. Thanks a lot. Oh, bye. Bye. Bye. Wonderful. Wonderful. Young lady from Broward. I told you, Broward is where it's at, right? I didn't say what. I can't believe her Sean Cassidy and very manalow on opposite pages here. Is that enough to make you just want to scream? Yeah. It's mind boggling. He screams already. That's not over here. And there's a certain talk host in town. If we sent this picture, I did not be able to do his show this afternoon. Trust me. This afternoon, he would not be able to do his show. He would be uncontrollable. So it must be an afternoon. He, they'd count. He, hello. Yeah. Neil Major's please. Okay. No, I'll just stand Rogers. Well, I do sir. Listen, um, leave the humor to us sir. Okay. Sorry about that. That's okay. I was going to make an appointment as a doctor. He's going to make an appointment as a doctor. He's going to make an appointment. He prescribes. No, nice for those areas that hurt you. Why don't you stop and see Dr. Bend over. Okay. Okay. Good luck. They count. He, hello. Are you doing good? What's up? I like to thank the birds. The football begins with the Sunday coming up. It'll be a strike. Have a. Yeah. He comes up with some real useful stuff, doesn't he? Yeah. He should work things keep going that way. You can have she can take it to. Are you, and now wait a minute. Let me ask you a question. Are you upset about the fact that we're obviously going to have the strike? No. I don't watch football. I'm doing good for you. Good for you. I mean, there are a lot of us who are finally outgrown all of that. You know what I'm saying? Maybe a little world federation wrestling. Yeah. How has it been? All in the wrong places here. It's just piled high. You're in the pool for bam bam. No, no. I don't think so, sir. He's not my type. Droward, hello. Hello. Yeah. This is the mobile. I talked to Neil. A mobile, you're on the air right now, sir. Look at all the money we're saving you. Right now, this is unbelievable. Incredible. Yeah. It's incredible. I had to. Especially with a level of conversation so far as unbelievable. I can't believe this. I can't. I can't. I can't. Because I'm trying to figure out where this ice cream is. I'm using a first city. I'm not driving up and down like a crazy. Oh, I'm going to tell you, if I don't get a piece of the action in that store, well, depending of what kind of action it is, I guess. Just a joke, Brian. Don't get nervous now. Listen, I live and I will go up there and put them under my wing. You know, but he will get anywhere near that child, believe me. They closed the ice cream parlour in days. He can handle himself. And they, and that's what he told me the other day. He said, uh, leave me alone. I can handle myself. And they said, can I watch? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just a joke. Just a joke. It closed the other ice cream parlour. Well, when I pay a lot of money to see that, go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. They closed once. Of course, they're going to close down all the other ice cream parlors because there's only one that counts. I know that's Neil and Stans ice cream joint. I'm university. Right. Oh, where? Where are you? Where are you? Where are you? A fridge. Now, why is it you sound so before I give you the information, I'm a little nervous because you sound a little too anxious. I mean, you know, a little ice cream Sunday is fine, but it's not the beginning and end of the world. You know what I mean? Important to me though. Yeah. In other words, it's an emotional issue with you. It's like, well, I can't believe I'm many miles I've been riding. It's driving around like a man man. I'm in down university, right? And I can't find it. You know, it's, it's a big line that's ice cream right on the corner of that part of the strip shopping center. I mean, any Dumbo who couldn't find it has got to be a mental case. Is it near Oakland? Is it near? It's north of Oakland on the east side. Well, north of Oakland, the next main light, I think is 44th. Okay. Well, north of that on a right hand side, there's that strip shopping center that goes on forever. And about in the first third, there's the Maryland Oyster, Mung Place, Cluster-Opte Palace, and just beyond that, there's a spreading that store and just beyond that. It says ice cream and big letters, E-Mac and Volios. If your favorite place got ice cream. What's that? He, he tastes the top. What? He caves. Burger King. Oh, yeah. I still got ice cream from this morning. Let's thank you for a direction. Well, wait a minute. Now, why are you so hot? The cold out immediately. Why? The hat too. Why? So, you said so much about it. Me, it's not. Anyway, I got to go. Okay. Good luck to you. They're not there right now. They're in school, but that's how I get them out of the way. Really? Then they'll be able to see who this guy is and then later on they can kick him out. What the hell is this? The center is called Promenade of Inverry. Well, La de D'A. In La de Heal. But it's in La de Heal. You know, that whole part of Howard County is so incredible. Remember what we did the thing about that publics? And we went on for hours and nobody would admit that that particular public is in their neighborhood. I mean, all it's in sunrise. No, it's in Inverry. Right. Now, I would think that a lot of people would want to take credit for the ice cream stand. It's in La de Heal. But it says Inverry. But it says the Promenade of Inverry. And on the opposite on the west side of the street is a strip shopping center that looks the same. Yeah. It's got a little Italian restaurant and there's a Japanese restaurant, a sushi place in there. I mean, how can I be any more specific than this? Well, if it's north of Oakland Park, it would be in Vray. Wouldn't it? Well, seems to me like it would. And any kind of sewer in my audience who can't even just sniff it away, I agree on a door. Good luck to you. Well, yeah, we have a lot of people in this audience who can't find it. Well, obviously there was a reason. You know, all those people that have those bumper stickers that say, I found it. Our listeners have bumper stickers that say, we lost it. Sorry. Well, this guy sounded like he was trying. That's hard. Yeah, he was desperate. Look out Brian. Yeah. Yeah. Okay, there's a little takeoff from the Notre Dame game on Saturday. Or those Spartans are they good or what? They are tough. Okay, let's go to a browner, hello. Good call. Yeah. Yes, sir. All right. All right. What's the time? Yeah, this is right from the beach down at Marriott Harbidillo. Oh, no, I've been listening to you show us my first call in. Yeah, Ray, what's going on over there on the beach anyway? Well, I mean, that's those that dig that takeoff just coming into the portal here for L.A. He's not the F. Iron off his gun. He's got the squirt in water and all that. A lot of boats out there and pass the old helicopters. Night's day down here. Yeah. Yeah. You stopped downtown. Okay. Sure. Sounds good to me, Ray. You dig it. Yeah, I bet. All right. All right. Just wanted to call in and say hi. I enjoyed your show. I was just quite a bit. I know. I need to have the beach and uh, well, let me can I ask you again one more time. Saturday night I was over on the beach and it was like spring break over there. I just was sorry that I went over. Yeah. I don't go to the beach too much on the week and especially at night. I work down here during the day. I got you. I enjoyed the beach during the day. Right. I say, you know, it's uh, I can really can tell you what goes on there. Good. Well, we probably couldn't put it on the air either. Okay, Ray. Thanks a lot. Okay. Good. Is it a good? Okay. Bye. Bye. Now I'm curious about one thing. Now spring break of course is like um, or was in the past tense was like a ritual. So we can understand all those kids walking back and for the up and down on the streets and on the side while everywhere. But like Saturday night, it's the same thing in all these kids who are obviously local and area kids and some of them indescribable by the way, but that's another story. But anyway, they're walking up and down and back and forth and they're then they're the ones of course who are sitting like on the balconies and sitting in the various bars and just looking down and watching everybody walking up and back. But the hell are they doing? Nothing's going on. Nobody's, you know, doing anything. It reminds me of almost like staying in me in a Broward Mall. You know what I mean? I mean, there's a lot of looking going on and there's a lot of great bodies there, but nobody's doing anything. Sweet always is. Boy. Yeah. You know what reminds me of reminds me of going into a bar, which is why I've always hated bars and I don't go into them because what you see is a lot of other people standing around looking at each other. I mean forever. And then like maybe a 3.34 in a morning when it's all cleaned out, you know, then people the most desperate of the desperate are still there. And generally what happens is that the most desperate people kind of pair off and they all go and you know, and of course I'm still there at five and there's nobody left. So what is it? But like what I was in high school in gym class and kids for the basketball, not for the regular basketball team, but just in gym class. And it would pair off, you know, and it would pick you and it would always be a couple of us. We'd be the last kids chosen because we weren't what you call super athlete. Right. Right. I was never picked last though. Right. See you'll never pick last. Where they always put you. It was a left feel. They put you in the if you're playing in the basketball game. Oh, I think they have left. You. Okay, cross out the Mickey mantle on this four card ladies and gentlemen that was just strictly an aboration that they're ever was. Well, actually, that's do that. Yeah. And put down Hank Bower as they said around your basketball team. And Gene Woodling is it forward? And Yogi Barra is the goalie. We've got to saw straight enough. And the quarterback can be whitey for it. Yeah. That's good to be one not. Twenty before two and our on WY and Z your sports station. Listen, we got enough sports. We got IOD is going nutswood sports. Right. UAM now. They got the sports exchange and the sports this. I mean, it's great that they got the meds games even if we do have to listen to Bob Murphy. But but boy, they have got more sports talk in this town in a non sports town. Yeah. Just obsessed. So I think what we need is another good sports station. Let's take our last break. And when we come back, maybe we'll even break out into our new format. Flame a woman and a smoker that used to be a sophisticated combination. Men got long cancer. We just got cigarette breath. Now we get both. If you're a woman who smokes and wants to stop the quit, Jullo Joey Tempest, one with the earrings down to his public. And John Levane, Levane, Levane, kneeling Ian Howgland, winners for Guy's standing in one guy kneeling, look out. Really? But they're a pretty interesting group. Joey Tempest. And of course, if we could team him up with our production lady, we could have a Tempest in the T-Pot. Although I don't think he would stay in the T-Pot. He might come out like an I-Dream of Genie, you know, he might come flying out. Okay, let's take some more calls because we're getting short on time and no one has seen a hide and error of Mr. Major. Now could it be that? I told you you got a number. He got a number. No. No, you don't think so. Could they could be the magic day? He could come in here with a big smile on his face. We can only hope smoking two cigars. Can only hope. We just went into the office. Told you. Okay. Told you it'd be here. Any amenities going to come in with the exciting tale? Howard County. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, you, uh, redeem yourself in my eyes today. What, well, what did I do, Nasser? Please tell me something good. You mentioned Heather Lockler. Oh, boy. Now we're so hot. She is. Yeah, she is also something on TV. Can't tell you to let Glambley see. Let him be Joe and dynasty. Say there you go. Well, I'll watch the show, but I do know. I want to tell you if I were so inclined, if you know what I mean. If I were so inclined, I would just I'd be fantasizing about her round the clock. I would have every picture every fold out. I mean, she is I don't understand what these people get up all excited about fawn haul and these washed out really. Itkabod crane looking type. Right. Am I right? And Joan Collins is another one. You know, she looks like your grandmother. Yeah. She's Joe Collins is way past. What a bang. There is one thing that I had there last year that kind of steel fan is, you know, if you ever saw the Hudson she married. Yeah, we have a picture. One of these team. And why these magazine is a picture. He's from not Lee crew. Let me see it. Right. He's a guy from the crew. The video. Maybe I'm missing out on something here. Is that why? And one, it's in the marriage. There's a section on. Oh, yeah. That's one that had Dural Oats and that other guy. Yeah, the married section. Well, it's something about any any woman named Heather. Don't you agree? Well, just the way she looks at that space. She could have almost any kind of a body, but she has that first all American farm girl face. She just too pretty for yeah, but she matches her name, you know, she looks like her. Oh, you got her name, Master Faith. Yeah, that's the real name. Yeah, exactly. I don't even, but she looks like her face. Oh, here's her. Alley, she'd be in Steve Ross. There's John Revoltah and Mary Lou Hennard. Tony Danes is enough to make you want to never go to the Brooklyn again. There's Pat Peterson and Nicolae Sheridan from Not Slanting. Oh, I'll tell you something. I can hear the soap. Pat Peterson and Nicolae Sheridan. I think either one of them would do it for you. But where's the, where's this picture you were telling me about? Couples we would like to see. Is that it? Are they here somewhere? There's Brian Bloom and Allison Smith. No, baby. No. Corey Feldman and Holly Dross. No, that's not that's not it. That's not it. I'm going to have to. Oh, boy. We've only got ten minutes left in the show. Well, we'll find it. Yeah, I'll find it. Anybody I know can find it. Oh, there they are. Daryl Hall and Corey Hart. I know many. Okay. Well, I can commend you on your good taste. Sir. All right. Hey, does your phone system have the capability to let a caller go out through your PA system? No. Oh, two bears. Oh, here they are. Tommy Lee and Heather Lockleer. Now, what are you talking about? He's road test. But I mean, oh, and he's got all these tattoos on his arms. He looks like mong. I'll let the seat of look what a parent face. And she put him on the front. Oh, my God. And he's got an earring down to his public. I know how the good one. Each year hard out. Okay. Good. God. Now, I hear Stan talking about that a lot and it's so true. These couplings where one of the two people is really incredible looking and the other one looks like just deadly. Oh, no. horrendous. It's the prime example. Well, here he is, ladies and gentlemen, with the big word, we're looking at of a space very carefully. The answer is no. There is Tom Cruise and Meanie Rogers. Right. And there's another example. She's okay. She's fine. But he can do better than right. And there's a mealy O. S. Trevez. Oh, boy, who's he would? And Demi Moore from about last night. Did he more Demi? Yeah, did he more. Yeah. He belongs with Demi Moore. I'll tell you. She's real cute. Oh, and look at the earring that this Emilio has got to his ear. It's a size of a walrus. Oh, my God. What is this thing with the earrings? And here's here's Kevin Bacon who looks like he's been making bacon. Yeah, Bruce Willis, I said on the Emmys. Tracy Paul earrings is hanging. Bruce Willis is one of the most disgusting, no-tallid people in the history of mankind. I don't understand that at all. Emilio looks pretty good here. I'll be honest with you. He would just keep his mouth shut. You know, but he doesn't he have that same psychotic look that he always says. Psychotic is something wrong with that child. I don't know what it is. But I sure be willing to find out. I have a fad crush on Tracy Pond. Oh, and here's the section for you, bird here. The good said with all little three-year-old kids in here. Here's Danny Pond's from Valerie. When I was in the fifth grade, these are all for you. Great. Now Martin Schene is in the psychotic is this kid. No way. He's like normal compared to Emilio. Am I right? Well, Charlie Schene. Oh, yeah, who's that we heard today he's getting married to or something? Pat Peterson. Let's take a call from Broward. Hello. Hello, Emil. The man that's on the air with you to the F. She could pay for sitting there laughing. No, we try to pay him to get out of here, but he'd rather volunteer. He likes to do volunteer work. Well, the letter that you received this morning addressed. It was addressed to the right person. The laughing, what was it, Jack asked? Something like that, right? Yeah, I think they were right on target. Great. Hi. What are your relatives going down here? No, no, no. They'd count. Hello. That was an incredible call, wasn't it? Yeah, it was. Anyway, I want to congratulate you and stand for a wonderful true off. Yeah, that was quite a kind of enjoyable. I can't believe our winner, Russ, or past the Guinness Booker record, there was a new record right on the radio. Sure was. Yeah, he was great, except for one thing, Neil. What's that? Last off of major portion of our population, young Jewish men, don't you think we should have a, uh, well, after the holidays, we don't want to do it now because it would be deemed as being sacrilegious and far beyond for me to be sacrilegious. After the holidays, we're going to have the great hoods book on this. Exactly what I was going to suggest. You know, where have we heard that idea? It's probably subliminal. He didn't really hear you say it earlier, but it just, you know, you bounced off the wall. Yeah, the bird actually suggested that this morning. I think we can probably get a good 20 second Yeah, I wasn't going to do it when it was his idea, but now that a fairly much honest on the caller suggests that it why not go for it. What does that say? As they say in Lauderdale, go for it. Are you ready? Don't you think Thursday would be the perfect day to do it? No, I don't. Okay. And don't start getting our Jewish friends upset. I go your friend. Let's go to rock or in hell out. Yeah. Yeah. What's with the voice? Put your not the little. Yeah, I know. Come on. How about the empire? Yeah, that's good. Yeah. He's one of the road and let it be coming out on CD. This is one of those guys who was in boys in the band. I think. Yo, speaking about it. So this great bag. Like last night. Come on. Now it's your book up a little. Oh, bag. Yeah, I bet. We're not that all male. We're out of the seat. You're listening to hung and the restless. You're everything. This is probably one of those guys that goes up for ice cream every hour on the hour. Speaking about a human stand going up to you, Max tonight. You bet. But what time eight o'clock? You guys give out autographs. Yeah. You're going to bring the bird with you. Stan will give out on. No, we wouldn't bring him up there to pollute the neighborhood. Are you kidding me? How about bringing Jean Cashman along? Oh, come on. Sir. Are you really that desperate? I switch it down in that. Oh, boy. Swish it. I think is what you meant. Jean Cashman. What is it? What is it? Are you in the girls that look like guys? Oh, Jean, Jean's that bad looking. G. E. N. E. Hardly just a judge. Stan's such a look by Stephen X. No more like Stevie Wonder. Okay. Let me get it. Come on. Come on. Come on. I'm not going to do this just for you today. What do you think this is? I can't give my version of what is it almost era of Russia, Shana, and you're, you know, you're starting to be sacrilegious, sir. Okay. Can I complain about Stan? Yes. He's sitting right here. Uh-huh. Don't do it, sir. Don't do it. He's already in a early mood. He's upset Monday. I just wanted to talk about reading the TV guy. Call that phone number last night to turn out to be a guy. He's very upset. How about the reading TV guy from cover to cover? That's going to be the show today. How well, telling me what you do. How about telling me what you listen to on the afternoon fellow? So, you can. You like that excitement? You want to know the truth, Stan? Yeah. I listened to an hour of you, and then I switch over to hours. That's how bad it is. Oh my god. Well, believe me. Believe me. But let me, let me tell you something, fellow. There are a couple of people who stick around and have a great time. Okay. Yeah. Try one or two of them. Yeah. And there's our lean. Yeah. Rintin was. Well, you're for Alice. Yeah. Okay. I hope you have a good life together. Oh, is he surely? Oh, oh, oh, well, every time I turn the radio on to try to listen to your show, you only had lunch going and he had one shot. Sonny Fox, even not me. Now, what have I ever done to Sonny Fox? Something about Stan? Yeah. Now, what the hell of a, I, I've let him on my show like four or five times since I came back to Miami. And I was a show. Why do you do that? Screw Sonny. Well, don't go that far. Boy, is he surely there? Well, I told him. It can be, uh, it's kind of I'm sick again. I'm still feeling that thing from, uh, I told you I still had it yesterday. God. Yeah. Well, that's the last dinner we're going to have. You know where. Wow. We had a real moving experience. You know, I'd rather it would hit me all at one time. Yeah. And get it out of your effort. You know, this is like three days. Yeah. Well, it comes in spurts. Okay. Let's go to, we want. She'll be sick tonight. I guarantee he'll be sick tonight. And there's no way that I'm going up there alone. I don't blame you. I'm not going up there alone. So it the question is, will you make the ultimate sacrifice? You don't even have to eat anything. You're not speaking. Yeah. Well, because you're the only one that you go in there. You know me. I am so sick and I'm not going to go in. No, Brian doesn't even know who I am. I'll go in every time that we can be right there. Yeah. I know that. What are you going to do if he's not there? If Brian is not working tonight, you'll never hear the name of that ice cream place on his I'm serious. We'll go right to Larry. So yeah, we'll start promoting a new place. I mean, I don't want to get surly, but that's who's that is given as so much bad information. He's given us a lot of crate. So that they got a hello. Hello, you are. Who you're making put on your couple? Oh, Brian. I was trying out it. I was trying out it. Cool there. I got very sick. You make it sort of me and Mr. Ambition. Come on, Brian. Put you up a little baby. Okay. Bye. Bye. Incredible. What? And then he took a shot at Stan. He did take a shot at Stan. You know, these FM Jocks. Who needs money anyway? He's a jerk. Like that Joey took a shot at me the other day again. You know, he just can't resist. Yeah, Mr. Hasn't he? He was a big chronic color for Sandy's show when he was doing those TV repairman and I especially do all these voices come naturally or what. I mean, boy, this is so bad that it's frightening. I think this is the color is from the Emilio Estoviz School of Life. Yes, me. I mean, really manic. You watch manic by the way. One of my favorite shows. Okay. Well, listen, so you have a great weekend because before you know it, it'll be here. Boy, this has been an experience. I can't believe I survived it. I won't congratulate you again. Please don't for surviving the four hours. Please don't. Why don't you just take a little soldier and up to the other and have a wonderful life. Okay. Well, that's going to do it. And of course tonight around 8 o'clock, probably some of our royalty, the royal family from the O'Rodger show, began to ring around the ice cream joint. Some of our kings and princes and princesses and all the rest of the royal family with their crowns on. And you know what I said. Some of our friends had better be there working than I'm going to have a lot of ice cream. Might even get a big banana split just in honor of the occasion. Stay tuned out for a stay and because it sounds like he is in a great home. There ought to be a four-hour room. That will go down in history.
