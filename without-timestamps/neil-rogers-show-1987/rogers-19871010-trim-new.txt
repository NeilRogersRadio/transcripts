I'm not gonna use sighted about it. I could be over-infused about it and Monday morning. How do we now? How do we explain this in a way that they can relate to because the audience seem to be very slow during the week? Monday morning I'll be on Zeta 4 at 94.9 on FM 6 to 10 Monday through Friday every morning no more Saturdays. This is not only my last show on WINZ My last show on Saturday, which is a lot more important to me Ever never again That's our battle cry never again and So basically that's it and of course the bird will be over there. We fought tooth and elbow. We still had to take him and The lead you'll let will be on the show this every morning to I've buch it up a little bit and that's gonna be at them We'll be doing a talk show Not gonna be playing 18 in a row or 20 in a row. It's not gonna be a music intensive show Every now and then to passify the program director will play a record. You know like maybe once an hour and that'll be it And I did hear all of those words of doom boy, you know once you walk out of this building All of a sudden they turn on you even stand turned on me. Oh, yeah, he's gonna have trouble with those phone numbers I'm gonna be really rough and You know, I just couldn't believe it all these. Wow. I'm not gonna go out by an FM for him I'm not gonna buy an FM all these guys with their cheap company radio I got news for you not only when you go out and buy an FM, but you'll be listening to it Religiously you'll be getting up an hour earlier than you ever got up in your life before it So if you can protest all you want But starting in a few days you'll be you'll finally break in you'll need your fix and you go on You buy your FM radio. It's really pretty pathetic when you hear guys like that because everybody has got an FM radio I mean even little kids have FM radio. You know, so all you big spenders out there Good luck to you. I heard about four calls in a row when I left here on Yesterday and I just couldn't believe it boy the minute you are why not got a bottle of FM? Good luck to them Good luck to you you know what I'm saying so anyway, we're just gonna kind of reminisce a little bit today We got some of the old stuff from the past year that really Kind of touched the hearts of people all over South Florida like Helen Dale vice and wasting away in Helen Dale And we even have something a little special. They be on a plate now We only do this on very special days on this show Okay, but this is all so far campaign and our desperate attempts to fend off the FCC and Portland Maine and all these other lunatics Only on three special days ladies and gentlemen that you get to hear this You'll never hear this on the sandy paint and show you can go to the bank on We are all being screwed. I say listen Why is this happening to us? We want the everything to get There's no place for us now even All around in the mouth you can listen But now you will find anywhere And we're all No fun to be There's nothing less for us to enjoy we'll soon be playing with children No fun to be We need to try to make love Listen to on i think Help And maybe we won't get the sun just while we're still If this is what I used to win too, I'd see what I used to do Or waiting for a smile, in fact they might lie Because of the FCC, you watch a band what we can do If this is you then watch a blue candy You be even tried to fan the record that the DJ played You are, I am talking to you, I stand here Stand and fight for what truth and your honor Into so far so we can tell you, MCC, what the end of our day are near Roger And so far outside, we both We have nothing to hide, y'all can't bear Yet your pinning's out and maybe the empty sea will take out Oh, a city in the morning now Oh, a city in the evening now, no one knows what we're trying to say We are the FCC to play The FCC, go away, and see me Get off our backs, let's see, let us live our lives forever A performance that will live an infinite, ungly Well, I'd say thank you, Marlon Marlon Bailey, of course, found that somewhere in a trash can And the broader, in the course, Marlon was a big part of the last year We had our ups and downs with Marlon didn't wait Provided a lot of laughs and a lot of heartburn, a lot of grief, a lot of jackets Oh, oh yeah, it's been quite a year So we're going to just kind of reminisce here today, talk to some of the usual Saturday mists fits And there shouldn't be too many complaints today, okay? Because generally on Saturday we get this crap about Well, you got to keep working Saturday because we can't hear you doing a week Because we're in school, we're working, we're doing important things during, you know, this midday hours And now that you'll be on the morning, everybody here on Saturday ought to be an ecstasy We shouldn't get any more of this crap like we had yesterday all of these can diffuse people What are you going to be on Monday? What about what one day? Boy, they are a little slow out there folks, okay? But we do have a couple of guys that the management has hired with sandwich boards We're going to be walking the beaches Some very heavy promotion going to be involved in this change And I guess I should mention that Jay Michaels is going to be here starting on Monday morning Let's see Monday through Friday from 10 to 2 on AM right here now and Like the real sucker that he is Saturday morning from 6 to 10 You know, it's not bad enough Jay that you agreed to do six days, but six to 10 on Saturday morning I mean you got to be kidding a real massacist and My think you like Jay We all like him and we wish him good luck and our numbers in date County We're just going to play a real mellow here today and I mean like get it over with already in date County 624 9400 in Broward 524 9400 I do want to caution you in advance that someone we all know and love has threatened to come in around noon And Well, I guess you want to give his last cackles in before speaking of last cackles. How could I forget? We also have another change on wins You know we had this great summer book so we figured we'll screw up the whole station now and we have a big change coming Monday morning from 6 to 10 I guess this is going to be my competition now and a little new wrinkle in the news business and we thought we'd give you a little bit of preview here for those of you Arlene Ross fans who are waiting salivating at the mall Okay, I want to I want to I wish you Now the pros and directors having a Oh Preview of Arlene Ross and Mike's will from the new Monday morning news show here on wins You'll never be any bad news even in plain crashes Ten car wrecks Instant fatalities drug wars Nuclear bombings They'll always be a little chuckle in your morning when you listen to the news on wins So that's a little preview what's coming up on Monday and I think what we ought to do Bob is take our first break Those of you probably have moreial wins logs for today show at home those of you who keep track and You want to frame this probably have a golden frame and You know save it for posterity ten eighteen at one thing for me.

How do I agency that advertiser is normally by? They by 25 to 54 generally and I had a seven in men in moon 25 to 54 Which is about probably the biggest number in the history of this radio station so we're very proud about that That's right now where do you like how many did you wait a number one in what in 25 54 no Where number three I think well you got to understand this kind of like WQBA in fact if anybody wants to see these things and see the Incredible way that the Hispanic community fills out their diaries. It's unbelievable The length of listeners here once they start listening if you believe them they never turn it off I mean they're just a glued in their on QBA in our HC But now we did very well it did three that was number two number two What are you writing a book or what I mean? I do have all of this but I'm sure the audience Like just who's who's out delivering you there? Well, let's see number one in 25 to 54 was waxy They did very well. They had a good book and number two Number two listen if we got along enough. I'll find it. I am have any idea who was number two Oh here it is life Life life I thought they have all those old listeners. No. I take that back life was number one and waxy was number two and 25 to 54 now Gotcha, yeah, all right, but of course live nobody listens to life. They just when you get trapped in an elevator you'll listen to it Yeah, that that that that that the radio doesn't work that station does no But all right, they guy want to know what was going on with the rating system.

I'll become very religious Really why Because Jews don't work on Saturday. Oh, I really I see well, I'm just working for No reason I don't work me too. I made too. Absolutely. That's why I felt every Saturday for the last year Huh Listen, we're calling some of the world great as type of cleaning company really Yeah, looking for a free plug probably right. No, okay. Oh no free plug. All right. What's the call and say hi? Good. That's all that's very nice. Yeah, my name's Terry. Okay. Are you are you gonna be listening Monday morning Terry? Yeah, on Zeta. Yeah. Great. It's already on there. Next one. So we've got two radio So one on yours and one on Zeta. Now you're talking yeah, and you can listen to the one on Zeta Pretend you're listening to the one over here. Okay, Terry. It's great hearing from you. Yeah, you have a good weekend. Bye bye Nice what a nice lady. It's 27 past 10 at WI and Z Do want to remind you by the way those of you groupies out there that stand and I will be eating at the melting pot around midnight tonight Of course they close them at night, but Now sometime this weekend we will be eating there. I'm not gonna give you the time because we're tired Of some of the groupies who just want to come around and claw at the end of the table You know, would like to be friendly to everybody but enough is enough and when you're having that kind of a meal You want to be left alone to sit there and salivate and to enjoy every last drop of that white chocolate and the cheese and Sit there and watch Dave stick his finger into the Griner cheese and just add that extra touch that makes it so sensational Pop a no hell hello Hi Neil. How you doing? All right congratulations on all your success. Thank you and I know you'll do well with Zeta And in fact, you know with the ratings that you've been talking about it seems like a lot of people in this market included the putting the media Seems to feel like it's only in the last year that you've had good ratings. Yeah, what are they now? Well, you see when you're on a night you're buried it like nobody pays any attention to it Well, you know the fact of the matter is I know when you were on W snooze You had double digits ratings at night and yeah, well even at the beginning when that station I think at a five thousand What signal which you could even hear and And then when you moved to W i and Z at night, I mean, you know you managed to take the whole audience with you Yeah, with our big nighttime signal that goes almost all the way to Pembroke Pines was an unbelievable signal Yeah, you can say that again In fact, where I live we picked up I think W let me see better than we did I and Z yeah That's a station to make enjoy. I know on 940. I know yeah, but you know getting back to I want to get back to Zeta for a second now I just I kind of hope that you do very very well So that maybe about another year from now they'll really make a change and make an FM talk a Rathom it Well, you know there's an interesting pattern that takes place and that is when I first came here Shortly thereafter I was really hot to try to do midday to go on the daytime because I felt that you know They were wasting their time with the all news which is kind of a passive format in most markets and The word was they will never ever Never take news after in the daytime on Wions And you saw what happened to that right? Yeah, and we proved it with the numbers then the word was that they are committed to music Unzeta they will never put talk on FM ever every day will never do it now Monday morning We're gonna do it so the more they denied that they're gonna do something the more I'm confident that it's gonna happen So you know yeah, but I like to see you give some of these people who run for the money because you know as far as morning FM is concerned the only one that I think that has any degree of being a radio person is built-in Yeah, Tanner and the guys on hot 105 Dan McKin and Jim Scala. They are really funny They're really work hard in their creative and they do a lot of funny stuff Don't hand her head music that I could listen to I'd listen to them, but you know I know he's a talent a guy Well, that's why when he called in yesterday I said Hey, we're not really competing because you're playing all that scratch crap and you're appealing to ethnic Young ethnic people and you know that's not our audience so we're not competitors Yeah, and the reason I said that is I hope mostly keeps sending all that stuff over, you know Exactly well good luck Neil. Thanks a lot. We'll be listening. Thanks. Okay 10 30 right on the nose It winds his little clammy in here is at my imagination See, no, it's not clammy it must be me. Okay. Well probably I'm flushed from all the excitement and every you're cold up there. Are you cold? Luke warm but not cold now Maybe just a couple of degrees you know I'm sorry when you get a chance, Bob So don't hit listen that could say 60 and it could be 100 degrees in here that doesn't work That's like they put that in there to law you wouldable false sense of security, but it doesn't do anything trust me This studio has been kind of interesting they built this two years ago May Is that right or no three years ago may three years ago may And it's a beautiful studio. It's probably one of the best anywhere in the business not not just in this market anywhere in the country It's a magnificent studio and One of the good things of it is that you can kind of dim the lights you don't have to look at anybody which is very good With all of this space age equipment most of which doesn't work, but it looks great But I will say this we've never quite been able to get the air To work right and here either it's like freezing in fact we have some guests may they rest in peace Who didn't quite make it through this show? In fact Jack Quarkheimer almost you know got into outer space for real one night on this show Because it was 100 degrees below zero and Then once in a while when I guess we come in we didn't like we would you know make it very cold because doesn't bother me I got enough insulation it could be 20 below it doesn't bother me and It's never quite arrived now. I'm looking forward. I'm very anxiously looking forward to finding out how the air works up front I have a feeling at that end of the building It probably works a lot better because all the management people sit up in that end of the building So probably it works a lot better sky like mall hello Oh, we all hi. I've never listened to a fan and you must help me to find this station It's your gonna be on well SM that says from 88 to 100 that's FM frequency modulation. It sounds so much better doesn't it in stereo? That's where you're going to be right on that band and it's 94 0.9 Now I have tried every station this morning is nobody the talks No, well, they're not doing talk they're playing music right now. They've been playing the beetles all morning But how do I know that it's 94 nine? I don't have 94. I have 90. Well because you'll hear my voice You sure well if you don't hear my voice then you got a pretty lousy radio You must have when it stops like at 90 or something. Oh, I have a stand-in. It's very good Well and believe me it I mean Zeta's 100,000 watts it'll come in so loud and you'll say that's that crazy kneel right there I think you saw a point nine and you're not crazy right in the matter fact you'll hear this Kacling sound in the background then you'll know who it is which I love now there's run as a sing yes Any possibility that you might change your hours to a little later after on the program well what would be good for you? Well, I think around nine They won't get enough of you in that morning. I don't get up that early. Yeah, why don't you mind kid up a little chance no Start going to bed earlier when I do but Hey listen me too. I'm talking I'm not you know I'm getting up there. Well, tell you Listen, I welcome everybody who wants to listen to this show everybody if they're nine or 90 But anyway, I'll stand would say if they're nine I'm not good at this or a thing When you think I could call you You can't meet again. Yeah, I'm terrible. I'll ready to be got a pencil. Yes. All right right down this number 550 94 90 In Monday morning when you get up soon as you get up just call in the world chat No, when a nine o'clock.

Oh yeah, he's big and that area. Very big. I like this. Okay, 21 till 1 at WINC and we're going to come right back. This weekend, oh, I'm a Spencer. Titi tough guy. Let's take a call from Volca. Hello. How are you doing? Good. Are you paying for this call? That's certainly a. Wow. And I see on Monday, you won't have to do that anymore. We have a Boko line. Oh, I know. And I hate. How are you doing? Chronic. Would you like a slice of pizza? This is a candy. Can you say kinky? Oh, I see. Brick of this. This is our chronic collar from Boko. Yeah. Oh, I shouldn't have told him about that. And that Boko line. Well, it's pretty good. Look, I haven't even told you about three weeks. Okay. Oh, yeah. Sure. Tell me you're not the good one. It's a treat. Okay. Are you? Yeah. He just got us to be related to Martin Luther King. He had a dream. Yeah. In your case, I think it was a fantasy. Did you talk to your buddy, Steve Kane about his ratings? You're talking about my. You're Kane. You're Pell. I Pell Steve Kane. No, I don't. I don't talk to Steve Kane. I talked to Mike Miller. Oh, now you're talking. How's Mike. Michael? Mike. He doing. I don't know why. He loves us. But he's going to roll up there. He's having a great time and he's I heard that he started a petition drive to bring the dolphins to West Frown Beach. Is that true? He's trying to bring the Minnesota North Star. Oh, yeah, that'll be good Stanley Cup playoffs for council. Excellent. A Florida's gonna be great. Good hockey is so big and Florida. Yeah, yeah Like an L.A. Yeah, but anyway, I think I'll throw him a quag with also on that Elvis is a North heart. Very possible. He's right. He's sniffing around and get us to play it. No, no. Good. Cause we're not. Oh, did you watch Blue Velvet? No, I turned on the movie channel for it spashing out on me last night. They couldn't watch it. Really? Yeah, it's just about the part where the year was deteriorating in the woods. Oh, yeah. I told you it was your kind of movie. And then it went crazy and I just had to turn it way up to here and I'm done. Well, it's understandable with the movie that it would start spashing out as you say. I'm trying to conjure up in my mind to movie channel spashing out. You know, it's an interesting, well, that's it. No, you got to backwards. That's a new movie. It's gonna be on the movie channel. Spashing out. Right. We'll go to the Sissy space second and the media went to it. Spashing out. Well, you know, since we'll play with all the great and, uh, and you're great. I can tell me why isn't the bell call they're gonna be on the INZ. I hate listen because do they ever do anything here that makes sense? Okay. Do they ever do anything here that makes sense? No. Did they move to the FM? That makes sense. Well, no, I'm not talking about that. But I mean, you know, that wasn't, um, that wasn't the end part of the building. I don't want to take a couple of books to hear about a dashing. Yeah, and that was under great duress. Yeah, they weren't happy about that. They weren't happy about leaving her go. Well, I know well. By the way, and if that maniac that called Stan yesterday, just before the numbers, uh, uh, sour and nasty thing of that rude right wing douchebag called in, and I don't know why he's upset with Stan because Stan is even more right wing than he is. But, uh, you know, Stan had a four one. That's a big, that's a big afternoon number and a bar bigger than that he had even when I had that nine share. She had like a three six in that book and standard a four one. And I guarantee when the hour by hour comes out, he's going to just pulverize the number she had. So, um, you know, we'll never hear from that guy again. Now, we're with all that all in or stuff, too. Yeah, a miracle. Um, actually, and I without your lead and for that six o'clock hour, and they're bringing it down, bring that baby dad counts the six o'clock hour cable seven in that four one. You want to have to look through that anymore now that she's on in the morning, so that'll be good. Bring that baby down, Arlene. Since you got the book, they're how to, uh, I would do. I would fix them. I would ever. I would just sell. Come on. Still, you know, it's interesting. Did I look at the, I don't think there's any weekend stuff on here. Now that you mentioned that, I mean, Mark, you gave me numbers that haven't been in. Look at all this. This must be like a going away present page after page. Now, it just has the total weekend. It doesn't not see what are we doing a weekend. I had a god only knows if I took the time to find that, it would be two o'clock already. I got that first call. So, uh, hold it. Yeah, he got the call. What did you really? Yeah, you want to know, uh, at the end. Yeah. How much soda you drink and birch beer, yeah. How many glasses of soda you've had in the last week? Really? Well, they figured that affects your brain. So, then they wait the ratings based on how many glasses you've had. Well, look at that weekend. We had a, I had a four one. Mm-hmm. NWN said a two nine and I have a two five. So, we must have done very well in the weekend. I don't have to break down, but we did a very well in the weekend. They'll brought them up from a, like a two. It did real well with Doug Yang and yeah, he's good. He's my favorite. If you've got anything to sell, boy, okay, listen, have a great life and we'll talk to you on Zeta. You're out of my mind. Once in a great while. Okay. I guess he had nothing to sell today. Nobody's buying that's surprising. Yeah. Mirror more. Hello. Hi, Neil. Hi, how are you doing? I love your show. Um, I'm having a problem though. My husband and I are among those people who don't have FM in their cars. Oh, come on, now listen, I want you out, and a lot of other people, you know, it's not really that expensive. The head for sound advice, their sponsor vars this weekend, and go in and say, look, I don't have a ton of money to spend, but, you know, just an inexpensive radio and in the now a couple hours, you have all set, probably an hour. How much have we talked in here? Well, I'm not selling them for them, but you know, it's not that much. What, couple hundred hundred bucks for a real cheapie? I guess would be a hundred and fifty for a real cheapo, yeah. But it's not worth it to put in my car. It isn't. My car is about to die. Oh, or then buy in a car. Well, wait a minute. Tell me, ask you this question. How about if she just had an AMFM affordable radio in a car? I think FAM is very difficult. But I think FM will come in on that. I'm not talking about a walkman because it's illegal to wear those even a lot of these morons do. But I'm just talking about a radio you can sit on the seat. That we've got one. We have to get another one. Sure. Yeah. There's no problem. FM will come in the car or, and that's real chaz FM is line of sight. Yeah. I got to tell you, I think I have one of your youngest fans. My five-year-old daughter loves to listen to your show. Great. When we're in the car, he loves that joe song. Really? And he loves the other song. I'm just going to say. Uh-huh. And I just want to ask you one more thing. I want to know when they're going to put something decent on for the AM drive time. Something to listen to in my car if I don't get an FM radio. Well, she misses all the FM. Oh, no, no. No, you just, you've just got to get the FM radio Trust me. Yeah. I mean, you don't have any. It's 1987. Yeah. I mean, you've got to come in. Hi, I'm here in some but don't you think you need to put something good on the AM drive time? What do you mean in a morning? Yeah. No, it's not not what you want. Well, listen, if you want some laughs. Well, what about putting Jay Michael home? Six to ten. Well, you'd have to discuss that with him. He'll be on Saturday morning, six to ten. And I'm sure he'll have to regret that. Yeah. I used to listen to him on B.S.S. Yeah. He's good. Yeah. He's got a lot of B.S. One more thing. I got to go. But I've been hearing a lot about this I-95 song. And I've only been listening to you for about six weeks. So I never heard it. Well, you allowed to put that on anymore. No, no, no. They came down from Portland, Maine and they specifically, they were yanked out. They did a lobotomy on the building and they yanked it out. You don't have it. No. Is it clear they took it out of your building? Well, out of this room, anyway. Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Congratulations on your move. I hope I get an FM radio. I don't miss two months. Please. Love you, so. Thanks a lot. Bye. Two requests for that to sour. That's what's right. The I-95 song. That's the second request to sour. Well, I'll tell you what. If you're really desperate, there is one guy in town playing it. But we're not going to tell you who that worth it. It's, you know, it's old material by now. It's rehashed, we've played it about four million turns out. And if you're really desperate to get it, I have a feeling it's on that cassette tape. It is on the tape tape tape. If you want to have it not just here at once, but have it for your own. Send the bird to watch it. I walk into that one. Just send the bird to cassette and I'll tell you why. I'm not going to find it with that record. Just send it to hard. I must be asleep. Or Droid WZTA Miami. Free 3055. Thank you. I'm self-adressed envelope. There's no charge.

Then it must be a pet shop. How can I help you? I want to get a dog for my wife. Oh, sorry. No trades. You have any blood hounds? Sure. Pete here is a blood hounds. Oh, look at blood hounds. Lead for the man Pete. I also heard something about the thing called pep care. Oh, it's great. Pet care will take care of virtually all your animals that are in their expenses and replace him with one surprising, the affordable animal payment. Oh, yeah. I'm not just 130. Eight minutes till one at WI and Z. The last hour and eight minutes. The Neo Roger show on wins moving month, Monday to a morning. Sun Z4 94.9 on FM on the through Friday 6 to 10 AM. Did I leave it? I can A M. No morning on the FM. On FM. Yeah. You got to be very clear. You should not have done run now. Now it's all over right now. We confused him FM on AM.

He talked about when he got thrown off of the late. Oh, my Fox. Yeah. We're inferring that they had something to do with Edgar Rosenberg's death. Yeah. So going to have it. He said something about it. He. Yeah, obviously. Let me said something to Richard on Fox. Yeah. He did that tasteful thing about the genre of his husband. Oh, my God. And they said that they, they needed him in the dressing room or something and they never appeared again. They wished him away or something. Yeah. It physically removed. Did they really on camera? Well, that's no. That's what he. I love it. I told you the world was not ready for Howard. Only in New York. When on New York is a different world all again, but not not here. They only believed one thing he said, but I really don't know what he said. Yeah. I'd like to find out. I'm a good lip reader. I guarantee you know it. Knowing his material. I'm able to. Yeah. So I'm glad you're going on that. Because we can't get M where I work. Right. At the southeast financial centers. Oh, no. Not a chance. Oh, unfortunately, the only one we get is IOT. Oh, well, I guarantee you the FM will really penetrate. We're going to be some strong penetration into all of those buildings for Marcy. It's about time. Yeah. Trust me. I was wondering if I could do an impersonation of the bird for you. Please. Great. My mom says I sound just like them. Okay. Very good. Well, you sound like somebody in the nest, maybe not know the big bird, but like a little bird. I have to keep working on it. Okay. You work on it. I congratulate you. Thanks a lot. Oh, it's a lie.

I'm a competing station and you had the dating program. Oh, yeah. So, that's good. So you bet it was. We had a lot of fun. We married 38 couples. That's right. And then and then some very nasty rumors dotted flying around. The station couldn't handle the rumors. I don't mention what they are because I don't think it's my place. But you mentioned themselves several times. And you're a bad station that came to this station. And someone took over the dating program. Wait a minute. Could the rumors have had anything to do with the closet? Yes. Very much so. Yeah. And I don't know how many listeners out there remember all of those, all of those things. I don't even know what you're talking about. You don't know. He said there were rumors started to fly around the station. Yeah. Something about you uh, stepping out of some closet or things. There were papers and the whole community was up in arms. I mean these nasty things on this show. I don't know. I don't know. I'm talking over and uh, there were no rumors about him. And of course the show very quickly degenerated into a the kiki hour. Oh yeah. That was the sticky hour. Yeah. I'm over that. And one day it just disappeared. Yeah. I like that dating show they did on Fridays for words. There's a beer here. Oh my god. And they would not even, as they would cut people that mentioned it. Yeah. It even came on and said a question. Why don't you bring that back? What? The dating show? No way. Well, I don't want to say no way. We'll see what happens. Does that might be big on FM? In any case, no, no, no. The thing that real thing I want to tell you besides to. For a moment you for your many years of service to the community. And we're still a more positive people like you around.

And as you get to know her, she comes more and more attractive. As you get to know her and lighter. And then that mole sort of becomes a beauty mark. I'm kind of how you are. Oh, I see. Well, you'll be interested to know sir that it was one year ago that they fired me at my previous radius. I thought that was yesterday. Well, yesterday was the day. Today is the date. October 10th. It was last October 10th. It fired me. And it was the best thing that ever happened. Absolutely. They couldn't deal with me over there. They just couldn't take it. We've learned to see. Nice edition. Yes. Thank you very much. Have a wonderful life. Okay. It's a good time. It's a great taste. Yeah. Neal, this is noodles. Reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste. Okay. 117 at WI and Z. That is not the song that he harms during that scene. We're working up at the F. Crazy. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Don't know. Now we're beginning to sound like they're like those guys on it. Just we heard moments ago. They seem to wet. Like in the shower. They seem to gather those two. That's what they are. Look out. They go in that cruise and then I'm like, oh yeah. I'm in the straining. But they're all. They're everywhere together. I mean, everywhere. Can't get enough of each other. Evidently. Yeah. Margie. Hello. How you doing? Good. Fine. All right. I'm the first time calling Neil. Does that bug you when something you try to remember something and somebody plants the seed and you just can't remember it. Yeah. And it drives you nuts. Absolutely. I wanted to be in the last hour. A couple questions for you. I'm by someone. That's a dead. Go ahead. Give me a Joey Reynolds update. I mean, where's the skydiving? It's the actual hour. She's walking in the York. I think just to the east of Buffalo on Route 5 and 20, sir. Can't you see? Huh? Has he been canned? What? That's he been canned? He just got here. I know. But he's still. I always hear he's talking about him. Didn't hit in the road. I wanted to be tapping here. Well, I do know that he bought a house. But the rumor is he hasn't unpacked. Okay. I'm the next thing. I don't know if you can remember back away. But the guy that's being pain-replating on IOD. He even do it better than their guy. Mike Miller. Well, he's in West Palm Beach. Mike Miller? Yeah. He's getting better rating for him. Because he would know. No. He doesn't see one done. As a matter of fact, interesting. You should ask that. Because among all the other crap that Mark left me here, the numbers going back all year as a matter of all. For all the day parts. I mean, he left me everything. You know, I'd like to see that. And let's see. 3 to 7 p.m. Here it is. WIOD. Like. And the afternoon. Yeah. Okay. Like April May and June. That's it. They had a 3.1. Okay. Mike Miller. Okay. Most of that is Mike Miller. Steve came on a year like, what? June 8. June 8. So most of that is Mike though. Then they went down to a 2-8. 2-9. And now the full book. A 2-6. So he's gone down a half a point in just like three months. It's great. I hate the guy. Yeah. He's a real pompous ass. No talent goofballers. He's a self-inegle that's bigger than the whole community. And he's never had a number. He's never had a giant audience. He's never had a big following. And he's just a great BS artist. You know, he's done this great con job. And more power to him. If they're dumb enough to pay him that kind of money. And to think that he's going to really build him an audience. You know, it's typical. They're just a bunch of morons. I said the other day what he made out. Listen to him much because I don't like him. But he said he makes 600 grand. Well, that's for three years. Oh, now he's got these combined in earlier. Yeah. Yeah. That was a maze. I like the guy Mike Miller. That's the first. Well, let me just say this to you. The audience is not interested in how much the talent is making. Their interest in whether the show is good. I'm a show staff. And the show does still have excellent words. Stank is exactly what I was thinking of. You know, I listened to Mike Miller. He was the first. I am guy I listened to and I drank him off. Yeah. And I worked when you have your show. But during my one-half hour I listened. Well, that means you'll be listening more in the morning again. All right. And then I listened to Stan and he afternoon. But I think you guys are absolutely great. I never thought after turn on FM again, but it'll go on Monday morning. Thanks a lot. You have a good one now too. Good light. Okay. Great. Good call. Yeah. Great Americans. It's a good time. Get him out of here. Will you please? I'm sorry, Donald. There's no room for you in this studio. Like Marcus. Yeah. He's auditioning. Broke his heart. They were trying to auction him off. I think it was yesterday morning. They were trying to sell him. When they got up to a buck and a half, they quit. They gave up. Remember the big switch they wanted to do. Have me come over there. Yeah. Let's take a break. And this is our, let's see, second to last break. Right. I am on the Neil Rogers Show in WINZ. July. I am not. I'm not saying. Okay. 124 WINZ. We have a celebrity call standing by. Hello. That was a nice lead in. Well, that's why we played it for you Rick. Oh, I knew. This is Rick of Rick and Spod. Rick and Spod. On WACC, you 105.9. And we congratulate you on a sensational summer book. Well, thank you. And likewise. Well, thank you. And listen. And I, if I sound tired, we've been working really hard. I heard that you wanted us to contribute some stuff for your show. We finally got some stuff done. The hardest part was working 94 INZ every day. But we finally got it done. And I can make it already time. Excellent. We'll just take the 94 INZ out. We'll just to splice that out. Put in Zeta. That was a funny part. Yeah. Well, you get on and you start saying these things and playing those songs that you play. We have the lyrics that are in there. If you die, it's shocking. I know. Well, listen, I'm not going to be able to listen to anymore. How come? I don't have it out there. Okay. Well, that's a good excuse. I don't either as a matter of fact. But I might spring for it. If they give me the contract I'm looking for, I can probably get a Sony Walkman. Listen, they all want to tell you seriously. Please. First of all, I'm serious. Okay. You've to listen to you in the office when we get off the air every day. I'll bet. I have a voice activated fish. I might laugh. And if we adjusted it just right, when it's laugh would make the fish wiggle. Excellent. I do it is good for something. I have that serious. We've been trying to figure out what we're going to miss that. Great. But I want to tell you, you're a great personality. I've enjoyed listening to you. That's why I wanted to get ahold of you when we first came down here because we used to work over in Zeta's soda at the same time. Yeah. But that's what things are getting kind of sick. We just kind of stood back and watched, but you're a tremendous catalyst and do your extremely articulate, very smart and it's been very enjoyable. And we're really going to miss you. Thank you. Well, listen, I know we're going to see there. Those of us who can be a little bit civilized in the morning. We don't have to be hostile with each other. And of course, there's the other fact. Which we don't want to mention a name. But they're able to figure it out. Welcome to the Bate Tank. Okay. All right. Thanks Rick. Good luck. Good luck. Okay. Well, listen, we really made it now. Rick and Spuds from Waxi 101. I'll tell you this. We're not paranoid. We, uh, there's enough to share out there for everybody. Because we were going to take about half of their 25 or 54. I think it was nice. They had a great book. They really did. The whole station had a good. See, we don't come on and say, like, we're the only station in America, the only station in the market. You know, so we're addicted. Give credit. We're credit. We will be after Monday. No. We just, we don't believe in that. I think a Tanner will continue climbing and sunny will continue, you know, whatever everyone's doing. Yeah. And the Rick and Spuds will continue doing very well. And, um, you know, will continue over Donald and the happy relationship. And, uh, I know. And then there's that other show. And, uh, but we left out our friends at how 105.

I'll read the dirt. Okay, so those of you who may have missed it a little earlier on, not so I can't believe I did that. But I put it away. Are you ripping off all the carts? Is that what all these things are not all of them? Just the ones you see and the ones I get to live. I'm not going to have anything to do with them. Yeah, right. You dumb anything you like. Anything you like my opioid friend. Exactly the response you predicted. Good. Lower immediate paranoid. You know, I've been all my done John. We're even in your body. No, I've been. I've been. They're not listening to me now. I've been raving about his ratings all morning long. I made my bonus, by the way. Of course you made your bonus. Well, you can say congratulations. Not of course. Been raving about his ratings. And in fact, that a four one in the afternoon driving this market is a gigantic number. I saw an addition to which if you take out the six o'clock hour and two, the probably have about a four eight. That's right. So that's the highest number. I think an afternoon drive since Jerry Williams left. Well, that's right. They're really seriously. And that's seven years ago three to seven. So two there weren't as many stations on here when Jerry was here. Not to take anything away from Jerry, but he had a five six. But of course it's all over a Monday. Oh, yeah. Get that Reathbag here, Steve O. Steve, what happened, baby? Oh, the fun begins. Do you need the fun begins? Yeah. Remember that? Fun begins. You two do the 30th on the market in timeless. That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. That's what we're going to do. Two breaks. That's right. They wrote one in. So I'm sorry. I lied to you. We have two more breaks. So let's do one now. And then we'll do a big build up for the last break. It's 138 on the 136 on wins. Okay. Now listen, granted on Monday morning. We're going to be over on FM and Z4 94.9 6 to 10 a.m. Monday, two Friday. We just want to keep repeating that because we know that once we leave, this side of the building will never get another mention. That's not true. Like a AM is going to be doing something really big starting Monday morning at 5 30. So those of you really early risers who want to get into a good mood have a few Chuckles before you turn over to Zeta. Here's a little preview again. Okay. I won't try one. I'm just going to tell you. I'm going to try another program director. I'm going to have a good time with you. I'm going to try another program director. I'm going to have a good time with you. I'm going to try another program director. Now let's go. Roddy News on Wednesday. Newzing with class. Under is long as I live, I will never forget that rocking with class for that was on the longer bullet, you know, rocking with class. 95, yeah, I am Z. Losing with class. Well, failing desperately with class. That's what I used to work on the. I'm going to do the Bahamas. No, actually we had a call earlier and he said that he can hear the FM in the Bahamas. Really? So I guess depending on which point they live in, some of them hear it. Well, somebody could pick it up on their side like. Sure. Listen, we don't want the Bahamas. Okay. You can have that you have a lot of fans. Yeah. Good luck to them. You know, you have the Bahamas and you're very big done. I remember having a run. Just stay in major voodoo dollars in black wood. You're very important to them down there. Miami, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I'd like to make a few final remarks, Neil. Okay. Okay. The honors and our management of WID were absent when they passed out brain matter. Excellent comments. The next I'd like to say that I also offer my sympathy to you as you will be on the weakest power Transmanic stations. A restaurant pre-configurations in this area. It's a good one. Go ahead, sir. I have tried it out on three different radios. The GE, a magnabox and an emerson. And I'm very sorry. Well, I'd like to have with some batteries in them. I've got a buy new radio till I really get to get you in strong. And they're one of the say that I hope that when you bring Zeta up from the Doldrums, so they're 1.2 and 1.4 ratings. Yes. That they will increase their transmitting power. When you're talking about their 100,000 watts, they're having a high-rounder click across the highway. Wait a minute. Let me just say this to you that they was a problem on the FM tower and all the FMs are down. They're operating 20% power right now. But tonight they're going to go out and fix it. So if you've done that any time very recently, like today, that's why. Or I see, well, I'm in the area. I guess you're familiar with, you know, the Jocquit tribe, the Kicked tribe, Quay Side 114, this came board of work. All right. Now, we haven't been to Hocquit all different. What was that mean? In other words, we're not 100,000 watts. Well, we are. We're like 2 billion watts. No, they tell me that the signal is just gangbusters. Well, Sally is back. Everybody who comes in, we can Sally. Okay. I wish you the recommended. Thank you. And also, Ray, back to future news. Fast future change to a more productive, salary and a powerful radio station. Excellent. Thank you. Thank you. They don't listen to that. Yeah. Why don't you think that alone? His intentions were good. You know, wishes us the best. Like the lady wants me to go on at nine because it fits your schedule. And we're going to do that. We've got to accommodate everybody. Sure. Okay. Well, we're getting really right out of the nitty gritty. Now, are we 18 till getting nervous? Getting very nervous. The tension is building. Wait till Monday morning. What's that? Well, I have a few. I have a few things I wanted to discuss with you about my mother. By the way, that crap about the phones that I heard is so ridiculous. I've dialed it up. No problem. There are no fast busy. They've, it's a lot better than it used to be. You know, and it is, we said before, you can only talk to one person at a time. Right. Don't, don't flick up. Not because you've got the signal. Yeah. I'm day to numbers. Come out. We're all in a state of view for you. And I hear yesterday I leave here and he's agreeing with all these. Well, there is doom, doom, tears. One thing that you do have to remember. Yeah. Doing morning drive. And I've done it on a talk story. Yes. That you're at length of holding on a much tougher phone. Much less would not be holding on. By lines. We don't need 8 million lines over there. And we're not going to put them on hold. Courage. I'm punch him up. I punch him up when we feel like it. No, we are going to put them on hold. Really? That changed. Oh, okay. I didn't get the word. Oh, by the way, well, until you have to go. You're in the wild. Live by the city of Pennsylvania, Monday, that's why this show is fun. We don't sit down for a pair of things. We had a time. No prep. And do all this stupid little stuff. And lay it all out. We don't do that. Whatever. And who fought? Coconut Grove. Hello. Hi, bud.

I mean, to say what your first song is going to be. Well, we'll have to mull that over this afternoon. We don't want to tip our head. You don't give the competition any.

gentlemen those of you with your gold-impost score cards we're gonna be having to get up earlier our last break now on winsy this is a monumental moment we want you to get out your red pens mark off the last spots and hold your breath the other participation may have to go what do you mean that's what you've been reading all morning your mike's not on that's okay it's still not on one two there's you'll notice the headline o-linda cut now poor linda I know she has to write those wl yf still tops spanish talk rise and you've been reading the song morning and I didn't even know it was in the harrel does I don't get it I assume you did did you think about why no at the same thing in there depressing while Rogers fails yeah not the headline you want to see it fails almost that's what it said yeah right loses loses yeah you talking I get it the thick ally on radio listening cast its sights in slightly different directions this summer says linda easy listing life kept its number one while in the spring English language news talk stations rupor over all spanish language news talked down that trend was reversed in the summer w qba landed in second place with a six five w i and z dropped a third place with a five oh all three c-h r stations were down little bit yeah three a-o r stations gained audience most adult contemporary stations rose most I guess you left love ninety now there it obviously despite its average ratings lost w i and z ratings decline for w i and z's Rogers what kind of a headline is that eight and uh you're a m uh career on the depressing note but uh what that is all way to the earth is by bill Kelly this indicates a leveling off in Rogers popularity following the controversy and predictable leap in ratings he received during the shock radio hey they have early summer yet even a seven point five ratings impressive for a cultural host in this market a bit what this guy knows about radio you can put another fimble i would have had this early i did on the whole show on this jackass he didn't talk to any of this not only didn't talk to anybody unless and to this Rogers moved to w i and z's sister stations eight of four is regarded by the competition is a desperate move to boost data's flagging ratings at the expensive w i and z a m which will surely suffer from Rogers absence oh what a what an article this is what an article what a mung piece of crap couldn't even bother to call anyway you'll Kelly yeah what you know about radio now we're sliding you know i wish wait till we get the break done in September i figured out we had about an eleven share in September the biggest month i've ever had in daytime maybe anybody's had in the modern history of this market in daytime and the reason that went down with seven five is because in June and July was on vacation for three weeks and alineore took us into the toilet for the month in uh July guess what unbelievable what this man knows uh is nothing and they got him writing this column and the middle of the sun sent no like the other guy what's his name on k-t no no no no no no the other idiot the one that writes uh buddy nevin's who doesn't know where we are in the dial memory can put him seven ninety the who I am uh oh this sun sent no i'm gonna tell you just say no to the sun sent no friends but he needs a newspaper in his town you know well that's not anything anyway what is Linda Gunner's specific day part and hourly ratings cannot be confirmed at press of a white-in-she-colleys yesterday we would have given it to her all in mid days the top five were life neorodges joy 101-07 qba and Ellen jaffey on waxy that a great book of it waxy did yeah lucky no no no no no say the lucky yeah yeah they were lucky the kind of kidding and they had a what do they have a four five wow yeah they were up a whole well it's great there's no forget enough in the summertime the music music stations was that then go up and the not talk go down I know figure that I'm telling you I just I still can't believe this I couldn't do it I'm reading it that time for w-I'm saying that you know what this is from the school of wishful thinking and we're all desperate a desperate move to save Zeta Rogers is desperate on and on and on it goes and where it stops nobody knows what's I tell you the print media in this town so bushly gets embarrassing now you know why we thank the miss for Linda and for Tom jika for them we'd really be in trouble Miami likes could be our very last call on w-I-N-Z hello how does this deal to make history I'm just thrilled to be your last call in my first call to you wow I'm just glad to make you one all year's to say thank you and see I want to say is that it really takes a person to have a good summer steam to listen to you
