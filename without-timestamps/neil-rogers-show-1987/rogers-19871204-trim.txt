I do it Neo. Okay, sir Rick and I really enjoy your show. I listen to it every morning. I get up about four or 30 About the same time you do yeah, and well that's good but not in my house down In Darcy, oh night, put that video on and I listen to it as I'm cooking my eggs in the morning. Yeah, well the show will fry your eggs There's no question about that Now I think it's just great now. I love all the guys on there and You got great humor great humor yeah, and it really gets me up in the morning. Let me tell you. Well that's good. That's the idea So speak okay, well you've been a great call or certainly an improvement over the couple we've had so far See you later. Okay, I'll read the Darcy 27 past six and we might as well give this one last try Uh-oh, huh? But I don't give up easily and I just throw it a towel now. Are you not gonna call Greg and though? Yes, I am They're gonna hang up on well he has no choice. He's been he's got a directive for management Let me tell you something we get directive for management too and we go on the air We tell it like it is we announced the audience that management is brain dead and We fight for our rights don't we? But you're not great. We fight for our rights. No, that's true. We're not nervous and insecure yeah and We were Greg and had his number The nervous and insecure I'm telling he's just gonna All right, well giving him one more chance that's what I'm gonna tell him we it's 28 last six on Zeta four And now these guys have been They've been under a lot of pressure, okay? We do what that by by tape though. Yeah, Darl could do what you know I want to talk to us the least you could do is cut us an Okay, now don't don't hang up right away come on Please What you can't play anymore and I don't hang up right away just think about it. Okay If I be oralons did they hang up they hung up don't hang up by the oralons remember that record Sure don't hang up. Yeah, they hung up they hung up no got no balls Greg Jesus Play anymore that sounds like something out of a sandbox doesn't it? I gave him one last chance. I will call Donald after 10 for one and see if he'll cut that tape for it He won't do it the tape is not the important thing the important thing is that we during these last few days on this show Have developed something just totally unique. I mean on the AM was a different story because we were not competing We weren't even on the same band We were not in the same day part But here in the last few days we've developed something that's just unheard of And we've got all a competition on the show at the same time right? And they want to destroy it. They want to ruin a good thing Well, they're the elixirers showing you realize they have no act you would think that they want anything innovative and new they do it's the bandage But You want you to run it by again I'm gonna say it to again management and this business is all incompetent and brain dead. Well, I know that all underline all Okay, exactly in any color you like in technical In the color all right They're all brain dead. They're a bunch of morons, all right, and the way you deal first of all he's got a contract over there He's the he's the program director for crying out loud. They letting play what he wants to Exactly like they let him play with Donald So what kind of a gutless wonder is this but del turning into anyway? We can't play anymore, but boy he's the program director. It's they in name only Obviously he's got about as much cloud as Irma Ladoos has over here John moron They had to give him that title though. Yeah, let's give the title they promoted I got this or if they wanted to pay me that amount I wouldn't need any title Okay, well, we were tomorrow Tomorrow and if John moron is listening, I think you're a pretty good guy 630 on Zeta 4 and Where do we have that open line is in date counting it 620 what would happen to us? 3600 you're on your own Go back to the breakfast club 620 3600 notice all of people from the YouTube concert who we're just uh one yeah See that's the plot right how many people were there about 70 thousand something like that 75 thousand okay Well, this is a market of 4 million people So all the rest of the 3 million 925 thousand people who were not there yesterday They don't give two hoots about the YouTube concert all right and they didn't care about all that hype and all that hysteria Did they absolutely not in fact most of them probably don't even like you too? Well, they're very popular. They're very they're very big but they're probably overdone no overdone That bottle of vox I mean he looks like walking death He really does I realize at most of the rock groups that they look decadent and grow test and just discussed it But what is the big deal with him? He really he's like a walking scuss ball So that's another one of those groups that is to be listened to but never to be seen oh yeah like John Cougar Listen to him. Don't watch him. Barbara Streisand for what you would joy 101.7 fans Listen to her music, but don't ever look at her cross-eyed. You know what I'm saying See if you look at Barbara cross-eyed You know what happens if you look come it even's out Really and you think you're looking at her regular because she's no seriously she's looking back at you cross-eyed And it's like It's hard to explain on radio if we had like a on TV we could draw a diagram and show how like the Eye patterns cross oh I see what I'm saying yeah kind of like diagonally Okay 632 on Zader let's take a call from date County this time hello Listen to the level on these calls, man. You can barely hear this guy. Yeah, how you doing? Go ahead. It's not it's not your fault, sir. It's our fault And Listen, I heard you talk about about Rand Telly of the day. Alice yeah, and I had to call because you're not gonna believe this but I believe it a couple of weeks ago And I know what to send To listen to Alice, but I was Macarons, you know, no, it's not a Senate's an active desperation Over a couple of weeks ago someone mentioned your name Yes, and he said that that you were obsessed with this show I'm obsessed with this show that's funny because I never I never listened to it But then on top of that he says that you do pretty well You know considering that you've been stealing his materials for the last seven years Oh, yeah Oh, yeah, I mean That does I mean I don't know if you're aware of that, but this guy uses a lot of your phrases No kidding yeah unbelievable It's just a coincidence, sir.

He's like from the dark ages And you know one last thing if you're gonna play Elvis, you know play some concert cut Yeah, but you do stuff that's crap like Elvis in Vegas, right?

Let's all reruns. Yeah, well and he show is not worth watching the first time Why disagree I want you would I don't I don't understand the humor. I guess I must be very stupid. Yeah, right? No You just you probably just aren't have a watch and add into it and if you need get a it's like any other Cutting you got to watch it for a while right and also I understand that there was a major episode of not slanting you Talked about a yesterday morning last night and somehow it didn't make it in my house You were on the side Someone was watching reruns of Sanford and son or something and I was just you know have passed out and not paying any attention Then about 11 30 a dawned on me a little light bulb lit up over my head You've lost that show I've lost control of my TV said well is your TV said yeah, and yeah You bought it you paid for it. Yes, you say my cable. It's your cable that you pay every month for correct So how did you lose control well? I don't have the clicker box No, that's not yours.

Thank you and a great life Okay, I think that was the same guy that called the beginning of the show Just rising his voice six thirty six on Zeta four and I guess we'll do this now because I'm sure we'll get requests to play it again later It's the old new leave it to be there starring Bob Robillingsley You boba Tony down and Clint Eastwood as the beaver Yeah, yeah mom. What is it? I was a package done here fire just came in the mail Looks like it's from bubbles. Isn't that that doggie know what school? No, she's a hooker She's hooky. She plays hooky from school a lot. That's where I know her from Later up in the boys room hey, Wally look I got a package from bubbles. Oh, yeah, what did she send you? I see Ah, geez, she sent me her underwear I got a quick hang it around those kind of women Suppose I couldn't say I told you so but guess this is not time to be rubbing it in well as long as mom and dad don't find out I'll just hide him in the drawer here Later that same episode What look what I found in beaver's drawer Where did that come from? Oh, I think I'm in trouble big trouble Mom dad those underwear belong to To Wally You're talking about yeah, there he is he wears them Precious around in them like like tinkerbell isn't that right big brother Yeah Oh Can I yesterday we call Luke kelp and maybe today we can call Tony Dow And that piece something I know a lot of guys get excited a lot of people will get excited about people Most of you guys 638 on Zeta 4 will be right back Pamator cat so come to the sports authority you've never seen anything quite like it the sports authority Oakland Park Boulevard and root 441 Perfect Drive I wonder why Dan McKay and Jim Schuyler talked to us for about 10 minutes and they didn't seem to be suffering from any kind of insecurity, hysteria, or juvenile behavior. And yet when we called Donald and noodles, they seem to be some serious problems over there. Yeah, at how well if they didn't seem to care about it. And like what we called Bill Tanner yesterday, in Power 96, he did like a five-minute showy brought Carmen on and Dr. Root and all his characters and it were great, far close. And when we called even Joey yesterday, we had a great, a classic call, one of the greats in the history of Broadcast, and he was super. And we have on tape, if anybody would like to send a cassette in. Yeah, you like your very own copy of the Joey Reynolds call. It's a joke, for example, if you got a talk show and you don't have any material left, stand. We'll be more than happy to supply you with your own copy so you can do like about a half an hour on it like he did yesterday. He knew, believe that. I mean, what relevance is there? In all seriousness, what relevance is there between the Stan Major show and my call to Joey? Oh, can you see the connection? The reason he gave was that Joey talked about him. You know, Joey mentioned Stan. So? Well, that's not happening with anything. Well, you have to ask Stan, but that's the reason he gave. Okay. Now who are we calling? Yeah. It's a wonderful day. And they've been putting it 780 to 470 on say to 4 and you're just sneezing up a storm. I'm a little stuffed up. Another one of those people has a cold and doesn't want to admit it. No, I do something wrong. No. I didn't. I think you only hit six buttons. And I don't have a cold. You don't have a cold? No. I'm just just keep saying that. I'm just a stuffed up. Hey, here we go. I was stuffed up. Now this is going to be kind of interesting to see what kind of reception we get here on this phone call. Oh my god. No, it's going to be fascinating to me. In fact, it'll be really fascinating if they ever picked a damn phone up. That's what's going to be really exciting. Is this like a hotline? This is like another loop or loop count in war law. Dennis Collins. Yeah. Oh, I'd love to have that in the road to the... We'd start calling him if I'd come in early about 430 in a morning. And we play all our new material for it over the phone. How can they not be answering the warm lives? Is that possible? Is this another radio station? Well, just could be. I think I know who this is. Do you really? Yeah. What's your guess? Oh, I'm so excited. Oh, I'm so excited. How can they really live? Really? Oh, wow. Are you doing something on your ear? Yeah, well they're listening to those suggestions to improve the story. Yeah, I got that number to date. I still haven't had a chance to organize. Which is good because we're getting new numbers every day. Now, did these numbers all come from our friend and Kendall from fruit cake? Uh, it might have been him. I'm not that familiar with this voice. It will be. There was like about three different calls and I think two of them were from different people. Oh, I'm sure buddy, this is a big fan of you. Yeah. He tapes my show every day and I wouldn't have to tape it if he talked to us directly. You can hear it live while it's on the air. Come on, Sunny. Pick up the phone. Would you please? Would somebody over there tell Sunny that we're calling him for a cryo loud? Hey, Sunny. There's a phone call. Yeah, Sunny. It's that phone. Try to clear the cobwebs out of your eyes, Sunny, and answer that phone. Thank you, dialed correctly. I am positive that I dialed the correct number. Hello. Very excited. Very excited. I'm excited. I'm here. I'm excited. I'm here. But I do a link, Sunny. Maybe he's doing one of the bits that I did a few days ago that he heard on the year. Always the one that he liked. Oh, he heard he was just obsessed with Captain Dave saying called a police while he talked about the specimen. Bonno. Yeah, he loved that. That was a great moment in radio history. You requested about it. So like with a hidden bird. Yeah, exactly. Right there. If you'd like you're very on the Tupperware specimen container, we're going to be selling those here at the center. The fog is going to be burning off. It's like you're just hovering over the ground. Like being at a movie. You think that's an element? You see that? I think that has something to do with that article about Bob Lassiter that he's on it. There's a dense fog rolling out. So he's a deep, dank, deep pression setting in. It's like being at a horrible, really hard. I expect Bellalagosi to come out at any moment to make some biting comments on Zeta Four. It'll burn off with this. Well, I'm really sure. Gave this stiff number plenty of time to ring. Didn't we? I bet you he knows that we're calling. Is that possible? Yes, it is. Why would you think of him? Well, why would he answer that? How about if we rang the number in David Ross's office? Well, that he's not there. He's not there, but it would be kind of interesting to see what we've got. That thing. You can save things. Save sleep and other things. Yeah, maybe David is in there checking out the license and see what that renewal date is. Okay, 646, Zeta Four. It couldn't happen in nicer folks, David. Let me tell you that. Okay, where are we going next to? Don't even think about calling me, sure again. What the hell was that about? Two people called and said that they talked to the people with sunny studio. And they told him that you were trying to get through and they said they think you have the wrong number because there was no number ringing like that. It didn't make any sense. So I had the wrong number. Maybe. So they suggested calling the 550 line because they are answered. 550, why would 100? Why would I? Yeah, 550, why would I hear it? Why would I hear it? What if you... When you cut it out already, I know you don't have a cold. So what's the experience? It would better. We might have to pre-empt a new one. Did you hear what I said? Why 100 is Sunny in the morning show? Hey, this is the Neo Rogers on Zeta Four. I knew how you doing. Okay, we're on the air. What's Sunny doing? Is he eating a banana or what? Oh, Sunny's busy right now because he plans to show out an advance. Oh, does he really? Yes, that's a novel idea. Why don't you do that, Neil? You never know that from listening. That's a real busy. In other words, you're going to shine this, is that it? No, I'd like to talk, but I've got really important things to do. Like, like a radio show? Hey, you got an explainer advance, see a Neil. Okay, bye. Oh, plan to advance. You know what that is? It's like Joey says the same thing. He sits in bright. If you don't have any kind of a mind, and if you can't have any spontaneous humor or any kind of, you know, then you need to sit down and write all that stuff out. We don't do that. And I would never do it. I just couldn't do that because it's contrived. Like writing a script for a plane. Now, that's a different thing. Most of the funniest stuff is like why you're on your own. Spontaneous, of course, if you're quick on your feet or quick on your ass is the case maybe, that's what it's all about. Now, you know, Joey sidekick Bill Marshall. Yeah, you know who that is? He was, that's Penny Marshall's brother, I think. Right, and he was also Johnny Dark's boardop. Oh, when you would be saved. She's in my impression that the radio trivia. Another boardop. The boardops are doing so well in this city. He's basically Johnny Dark's boardops. They're making money. He's on the beat somewhere. He can't even find himself a job. That's all true. I know it is. 10 to 7 hours. It's an incredibly so. A 30s for comedian Joan Rivers say they know who Bert Kacker is. Now, Hacker was a pseudonym for the author of the article in gentlemen's quarterly that prompted Rivers to threaten a 50 million dollar lawsuit. Rivers denounced the article earlier this week during a tearful news conference in LA and demanded a retraction. The story painted a bleak picture of Rivers marriage to the late Edgar Rosenberg, a spokesman to climb to name names. But says the ID will be revealed when the suit is. You know, when you stop and think about this, wacko who answered the phone for a sunny and you think back to all of the mobile calls at sunny made to me while I went. I was on in midday on A.M. Oh, yeah. Now, how did we manage to take those and put them on the air spontaneously? Because I guess the show should have all been planned out ahead of time. Like every call should have been contrived or something. Oh, what's this set up? It wasn't. I don't remember. I don't think so. It doesn't ring any bells with me. So in other words, what this guy is saying is that sunny just doesn't have enough sense of humor isn't, you know, our spontaneity to do a bit on the year unprepared without writing it out longhand. Wow. Sort of like Joey. Yeah. Well, let's not carry it away. Let's look at the number. We like Joey. You're okay, Joey. Yeah. But I have a feeling that that first call we had this morning. I think that was from Joey's people. You do. Well, we'll find out what we call Roger. We'll call him again, little later. Okay. Joey's, he loves us. I know. He only wishes he had a piece of that nine. And I thought sunny loved you, too. Well, we thought so while sunny likes taping it. So then he can then he can sit down and listen to it slowly. He and grandma Boon can sit down and listen to it together. And if he listens slowly and off, he can comprehend what we're saying. Well, I'm sorry. Bartley cloudy becoming breezy later, a small crafted vice real good. We're going to get a light to pick your hand. Hi to the 76. Loadedite 49. And it's 54. Add Zeta 4, 652. And he found Hollywood Honda. Yeah. No, let's hope the customers can find us. Yeah. Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster. 654 on Zeta 4. It's pretty easy to see who the people are on the air in this market, at least in the morning who are secure. Well, I don't think secure is necessarily the right word, but who are not insecure, who are not bitten by this deep paranoia. Am I right? Those are the people who talk to us. And the people like brushes off and have all these excuses. Oh, we plan all our stuff ahead. We don't have time to talk to you. It's all laid out like a road map. What the hell is that all about? Sounded like it was kind of like a shot or something. It's like a shot? I mean, the way he's. He's slow. I know, but it was a shot. That was the whole idea. He must have read that thing in South Florida Magazine because Joey said the same thing. But how he sits for hours in the afternoon and writes out all this material, you'd never know it. Well, listening to the show. Or maybe it's he listens to old tapes and gets all this material. Is that possible? Like from New York, maybe listen to old Howard Stern and Scott Shannon tapes or something? I'm his tapes. I think about producing bits and advance or like before the show or the day before the show is a 90% of the time, you know, the spontaneous stuff is much better. Much funnier. So I've certainly got an all written on him. He's got all laid out. And I guess probably Sonny only see he does that in the afternoon and by that time he's tanked anyways. The busy signal complex and if all the lines aren't lit, I cannot the show cannot go on. Where did he get that? He hurt him the last few days. He's been something those numbers. Yes, I have. Pumping them, Fredically. He said early the week it was going to be a numberless week. He was not going to give them the number all week within 20 minutes. I'm saying here when one lousy caught, I think we're going to talk about mixed marriage. And what's pain doing now? I'll do what he's doing. He did do that. Yeah. You hear him call my answer, machine yesterday? I got some shun. On W-I-N-Z. By the way, Jay's got a big party tonight and I know that's a bullet gun. When there's a hurricane blowing baby, it's still the month of May. We have any ticket left for the hurricane game this week and in South Carolina. I guess. Yeah, he's ready to give him away look at the law. What can make me feel that's way to stand by Jay? Talking about sandwiches. Who's that? Okay, you know the interesting part of it is people are calling stand up and telling him that people are singing that song. Like there's had some movie. Oh, three bit of the baby. Is it? And the people are breaking out and singing that because the song, my girl is in the house. Yeah, now the guy said that he was at the movie theater watching three minute of baby and apparently Ted Dance and sings my girl. Yeah. And when they came to that, the crowd starts saying you stand major. The only thing stand doesn't tell you is what were they're hearing it. They're not hearing it on his show. They're getting it on this show. Oh, because he thinks my guy by Mary Wells is what the original song was anyway. So they're getting it from the day. We played the my girl by Smokey Robinson in America. I was in an air of the temptations. I'm sorry. Same difference. And we played this at the same time. We did it that whole bit. And we are the ones who have put that jingle on the map. Or ignore number three. He just called to listen to the show on the phone. What the hell kind of a message is that? Are you listening on hold? Yes. What, what do you have a radio? I radio upstairs. I'm in a tent with care and hospital. Okay, hold on. Okay. I did you hear him telling everyone yesterday that if you wanted. If you send material to Neil. Yes. That you're going to have to send. Oh, do you? I doubt they have to hear about that. What nonsense. Because he can't get in here anymore. And there's some things he thinks would be good. I told you the other day. He's suffering from Neil's material with draw syndrome. Uh-huh. He cannot steal the material in here. He doesn't know what to do now. He doesn't know whether the scream or eat a banana. I understand why because he's got EJ doing stuff for him. He's got Don Jr doing stuff for him. He's got Mike Wolf doing intros for him. What does he need with our stuff? It's another. He's got like two years of ACN stuff and he's wrecked there. What is it that he needs besides an act besides a show? There's something in this building. If they can't, if they don't have access to this room. I've got so much honey. I've got so much honey. I've got so much honey. I've got so much honey. I've got so much honey. I've got so much honey. You check the bubble colors. While he's slicking on a sterky. Okay. Oh, you got a call. You got a little more. Little, that's about it. Little, that's about it. Little, the rep site. 7-0-4 on Zeta. We're not going to play a lot of music today. I'm just not in the mood for music. Even though we've been ordered according to Buddy Nevens, one of America's great journalists. We've been ordered to play lots more rock and roll music. This guy just makes it up as he goes along. That you admitted that on the air. I'm missing. I wonder how that explains the fact that yesterday we played three records in four hours. I missed the day. And one of them was like a going home record. I mean, it was a good one. It was filling off your freedom. Yeah. Going home record. Yeah. Yeah. Buddy Nevens was, was he jad or jethro? I always get confused when I see the show. Which one he played? Yeah. He's a kind of jethro doll. Zeta forecast. Partly cloudy becoming breezy later. Just keep making it up, buddy. That's awesome. Okay. They we admitted that we're leaving the air on the week from next Suke. Okay. You can put that in a paper. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's a 706. Look at it. 40. And we don't prepare the show ahead of time either. We fly by the scene of your pants. It's 54 degrees. Currently it's a to four 705. The following. Okay. It's a 706 on Zeta 4. The new Roger show on a Friday morning. And it's a low half Friday. That's right. I got a bottle show. I took a shot. Joey had a great hit. He had a great line a few days ago. I was driving home. And Gonser was playing some obnoxious records. And he had what did he call Jay Michaels. He called him a quailude sucking homosexual. Good Lord. And I'll be honest with you. I never knew about the quailudes. Hey, nail. This is down Junior. I know you don't like my old man, pal. But hey, you're still a pal of mine. Your new girl, Ohno, babe. And now. Here with a special Christmas message. The immortal Elvis. Oh, like you. Like a room. As here is the king. I don't know I haven't been around much for a while. But I want you all to know what up here in the Rocker room. I'll be able to think of you as Christmas. And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message. I'll be as a jeep piece. Like, uh, how about a little piece of that to hack on old Bob? Thank you. I got one. A lot of old slain. Christmas is a time of hope. Time of joy. It's time for love. And I'll share with love. Thanks for that feature you got there. I can't. What will you want? No, we're going like. Holy, I Christmas. The Christmas to me means family. If everything means friends, the friends means getting together. And getting together means. Eat. While passing it at home, take which will you all thank you. I'm going to remorse. Now, just won't say to you right now. You know, I may be a big star. Maybe too big. But ain't nobody stupid. I can't reach out to help in the hand. I don't know. Helping. I can. Well, you can't. Hell, but it was my status over there. Which is really. Like, like, very much. Now like, I was playing with. Ain't nobody stupid. I can't. Stoop to help a friend of the needle with a holiday season. Speaking of season, we'll pass me that self-circuit. And get the chance. Like you. Yeah, just, just how screw the cover. That's right. Like, I don't know. So this Christmas, why don't you all take a tip from old nails? No, no, leave those steak tips right where they are. You know what I mean? You'll appreciate it, thank you. I wish they remember. We're all part of God's great big family. And you know, God made man into his own living. And look at the mirror. I have to say God must be a big big, big, silly thing. You know what I mean? I like it, dude. But especially once you all remember this one last thing. And you're all as home as Christmas. You're just throwing that popcorn up on the tree. Save a big, big bowl for the Kennedy. Extra blood, I don't know what I mean? I like it either. Okay. Like I learned that. Is he eating on the air? I bet you're sure you're home. I would have never spoke to him. I've seen her an LVs eating on the air on Zeta 4. Would that be disgusting or what? We've been flooded with people who enjoyed the E2 concert last night. We've had one call. You know, they spent the whole day on this station yesterday. Just going ape over that E2 concert in that Bono Vox. And I'm telling you, I mean, you know, some of their music is okay, but I wouldn't get excited about them. I wouldn't walk from here to the edge of the fog to see you too. Right. I wouldn't. Would you? No, I enjoyed their music, but I would not go to the other end. That's all I can kind of go to see. First of all, like I said before. Now the music's fine, but I wouldn't go to the orange bowl. Or the sport of time. I wouldn't go to any bowl. Anyone should be good. Who's at the sting constant? Sting ought to be excellent. And the January. And that's the night center. See, I will go to the night center. Yeah, that's nice. Okay, here's every breath you take on Zeta 4 by the police. Okay, let's go to date County. Hello. You be there? Okay, this caller either be illin or be ill? Yeah, see? I told you they were still there. Yes, sir. This video. Yeah. No, no. I was, what I do was I call you and I put the phone down and just listen on the video and now. And then you wait to find out if it's your turn. Yeah, yeah, and just as you pick up the phone, I'm hanging it up, right? Yeah, and I rush to the phone for you and hang up on me. I wouldn't do that to you, sound like a great American. You have your right hand. When you call up the other radio stations, that's probably one of the best parts in your show. It's pretty revealing though, isn't it? To see which stations respond and have a good time with us and which ones are just testy and won't play the game. I wonder why people don't do that. They just think a couple of minutes and at least, you know, you're a few at least. I like this guy in one hundred this morning telling, he's so busy in this and that. Yeah, that's sunny box. You, uh, how do you call those dudes, uh, why are you up here? Yeah, I called. Didn't you hear that? No, I didn't. I called him about the quarter to seven. I think I said, don't hang up. Give us a chance here and they started singing, don't hang up. Yeah, well, they're, it's not them. They're under a lot of pressure over there. They manage, but it's just totally psychotic. They are very good. And when the next numbers come out in about ten days, they're really, they're going to be an intensive therapy for weeks. Hey, listen, I'm about numbers. I'll hold your station doing this one. Yeah. Well, we're on the up or on the up swing. Let's put it that way. On the up swing? Yeah. That's good. Of course when you start, because you're the rock and roll monster. When you start at zero, though, you have to go up. You keep going down. It's true. Now listen, man. It was nice talking to you. Like what? Like what? You're pretty good. And I was going in the morning. I was going to the wake up. Well, that's good, because that's what time it's on. So that's a good start. Okay, buddy. Thanks a lot. Bye, boy. Boy boy. Hey, that's starting to catch on. Yeah, not Joey's going to accuse us of stealing that from him. You know, I was high a high end. Then we turned that into boy and boy. And now ours is boy boys. It's pretty close. It's like, you know, those lawsuits against George Harrison and all these other and Stevie Wonder. Yeah. But I'm not concerned about that. I would Stevie Wonder steal somebody else's material. Something to think about. Okay, we have it open. No, we don't. Boy, the lines are hot today. The lot was we punch your buttons on ZF4. You know what I'm saying? I'm really getting choked up a bit. Okay. Let's move right along. He does have a big party tonight. I can't believe it. He was from all of you yesterday. That's right. And he is the party animal. Oh, yeah. Well, he at least didn't sit. He nonstop party guy. Oh, yeah. It's got that little boom box. I guess the big boom box he takes like the major events like if he's in the orange bowl or the night center. And the little boom box is like to take to your house or, you know, the holiday in something like the Marriott. The Dipperware party. Yeah, they, they've, they've County. Hello. Hello, me. Good morning. I want to tell you thanks. I got my cassette. Great. Which was excellent. And I said a copy out to Hawaii to my brother. Beautiful. And he sent it back and said, It was a life with letting him listen to it. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Anyway, I got two now. And also got my buttons on the bird. Beautiful. Well, sounds like you're in good shape. Yeah, except let me tell you something about that choosler stand. You know, he said right in send in material. Make a program. I'll send you a poke t-shirt. He stole my material and didn't send me a t-shirt. Do you believe that? Yes, I do. I swear to God, he called up on it. I called up the program. I'm going over there. The switchboard and told me was stealing my material. Yeah. I got hung up on me. What, one of the worst free loaders in the history of broadcast. And then who is this guy? They're working the board over there. Not Kyle anymore. Well, you mean Roland? Oh, I don't know who he was. You know, there's, I have an interesting question about that. His name is Bob Roland. And when he used to run the board for all of us, we used to call him Bob, which is generally what you call people. You don't call him by their life. For example, we don't, we didn't call Kyle Isley. Hey, Isley, how you doing? Exactly. And now all of a sudden that he's become a superstar, he they call him by his last name. Hey, Roland, what's, what is that all about? That's what he was. Why? If you call him Bob, he gets all upset. Why? I don't know. Roland? Roland? This is Dr. Roland. Roland? Your CCR on Zeta 4. The bird, did you get my letter? Which one? One, I left a dollar in for bird's seat. Appreciate it. No, anyway. I wrote you a letter. May was a long time ago. Listen, you know that beaver song about the underwear? Yeah. I was somewhere problem with a friend of mine. She's too embarrassed to go on by herself underwear. And she's still wearing this stuff when I think she's about 14. Believe that. Yeah, I do believe it. You don't want any putty that might be able to help her, maybe like, stand or something. No, I think my roommate is big on girls underwear. So in fact, he was wearing some blue ones yesterday. They were amazing. Anyways, with nice. I don't really hang up. She didn't want to go in a bin. I've been trying to get her to do that. And I've tried to see and deras some ducks on her butt all the time. Well, you can buy them for. Oh, no. I'm too embarrassed to do that. Are you really? Yeah. I don't even buy my own underwear. No, I did. Anyway, maybe some of these listening out there they give me an idea how to get her into a store. I know. I got an idea for you. Why don't you buy them? Yeah, whatever. No, that didn't get on the air. No, I'm sorry. No, just don't do it again. I won't. That's not usually really. That was the right word though. Yeah, well, I mean, I bring out one of the thing too is that you're your friend Steven, and you had a cut of tape for that guy. He's such a jerk. Who's that? He, you know, he was calling you Mr. Dirty mouth yesterday. Oh, yeah. I get anyway, but you had to cut a little tape and tease him. He's so open for a bit. I'm happy. I don't know. It does. I mean, I love listening to you. I'm sure. I might get keys to Rippie. Hello. You're okay. I'm sorry. That's right. You went. Okay. One last thought. He was telling the guy how bad it is to give a little boy gun and expose them to that. Yeah. And I wonder what his daughter started when he's to walk around the house and they expose them to what he was. So that little pistol. Yeah. Thank you. It's worth it. All right. Goodbye. Okay. Goodbye. Ooh. And that interesting. What he said that like, all of a sudden, there are some people who are like that in the morning. Like you'd be talking, no, not necessarily. Really talking to everything he's trying to do. And all of a sudden, Goodbye. Oh yeah. Maybe sell some. You don't like your ass. This one. You don't like that. I can't handle. You like the back out. Yeah. I think they're just kind of like, slink out the door. Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, imagine doing something about the guys at intensive care for crying out, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like I heard talking about the guys in intensive care for crying out, like I heard talking about the guys in intensive care for crying out and out, like, like, like, like what you'm saying, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like. Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like,اح-اح-اح-اح, like, if I didn't do something, like, like, like, like ago, actually like, like like, like interacting like like that. How are you? Hello? Hello? Me? Yeah. Oh, goodness. Are you called from Bay, and I called the Broward Line? Oh, board, you sound excited. I am. You sound dumb. I'm waiting to talk to you. You sound like all nervous and gooseen now. I am. I've never talked to an radio before. Wow. So how is it? It's a great I guess. Yeah, it sounds good. You got it's a great. I know. Boston, this is the first time I've ever heard your show. Are you serial how long have you been here? Oh, eight months. Eight months. And what the heck have you been listening to? I don't know. I guess. I don't know. Oh, no. Oh, the door. Do you know Scott was here? This must be Scott Sister. I don't know. It's quality rock and roll. I'm Zayla for. Or are you auditioning for your own show? Oh, no. But I come on yours. How would that be? That would be fine one day. One day. Some day. One day. One day. And here are the chiffons on Zayla for. Are you following any of this? Yeah, do you remember the chiffons? Oh, gosh. That must be for my time. Yeah, he's so fine. That was a record that George Harrison stole for my sweet Lord. Did you find? I don't know. But I'd like to find out. Who are we talking about? Is your fun? Yeah. I can't follow this. No, I don't need them. Like, let me show you the story. I'm not really in the morning for me. Or shoe fly pie. Obviously. It's too bad we didn't write all of this up. Can you imagine how good this call would be when you write it out? See, that's another thing I don't understand. Sonny is when you're doing a talk show like we do. How do you write it all out? I mean, the calls are spontaneous. You idiot. Not you, man. Just sunny. Sunny Fox with the V. I know my goodness. When you get up the early in the morning, how do you guys get up the early in the morning and have such it so to humor? Very easy. The alarm goes off and you get up and you bang it a couple of times. You jump out of bed, hop in the car and here you are like magic. One or two points up. For all eyes open up. That's my question. Yes, they do. You'd be amazed. I guess I would be. Yeah. Teach me how to do that someday. Oh, I don't think so. I think you're barking. I think you'd better listen to the show a little longer. Okay, listen. Have a wonderful have a wonderful weekend and call us again. Okay. I sure will. Okay. Thank you much, please. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. She was nice. Oh, yeah. I've no idea what she was talking about, but I enjoyed the call. That's kind of call we like. That's absolutely correct. 720 now on Zeta 4. Now we were talking about this written out now. Is it prepared? Wow. Kind of. Yeah, we were talking about three minutes of baby. The song with my girl and it that people and some theaters Yeah, you. That's what. While the original my girl is in this movie three minutes of baby, which is the Ted Dance movie that some people and some theaters are breaking into the Stan Major song and it is number one in the country this film. What is the Stan Major song? Yeah. Well, that's number one. Here. Stan's not getting any calls and he's depressed about that. But he finds out his song is number one. That'll make him feel a lot better. Well, three minute of baby is the number one film in the country. And it's first five days of release. It sold nearly $14 million in tickets. That's almost double. The number two film, which is Cinderella. The rerelease of the Walt Disney animated classic. You know what we went to see last night? Plains, trains and automobiles? How did you know that? That's number three. Well, that's what we went. That's the see Martin and John and Andy. It's funny. Yeah, fatal attraction is edging its way out of this number four and last week's number one film.

Potty mouth or whatever at least alleged because I don't listen to him at all Anymore and I don't listen to Alice any more so I don't know what stands bitchin about because he may not be getting a lot of calls But there's these got no competition there's nothing else to listen to the only thing I was zero is stand Yeah, I think the list to in the afternoon my radio is either on I'll put it this way if I'm in a car it's either on stand on FM listening to music hopefully this station except when we're playing CCR or in the off position Right that those are the only three options. I never think of any of the Now in the afternoon no because they're still doing that same tired old craft that is it's it's beyond passe Kane had Jack Sturdion the other day so I mean you know what is that tell you that's excited Did he have built comfort out at the same time? Bill Caspard was on Jeff Charles show. Oh god And then it too George Kapel was he on with Alice?

Is it between midnight and six? No, okay, where we can okay. They're intimate Let's leave it at that. Intimence. Oh, no tell Stan that man Antimence now I think maybe that's what's affecting his show I don't think he's eating as much Antimence as he used to well, that's probably what the big problem is Also if my good friends in windyxie up in plantation of a jack around our square are listening You know, I know you guys have got a good sense of humor, but these 95-year-old bag boys have got to go Yeah, okay That's not an ultimatale, but they got to go.
