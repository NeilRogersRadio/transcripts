Now you're being bad. Please hang up and dial again. Oh, fuck. Did I have you sort of? Oh, okay. Oh boy. I just, I'm obsessed. You know me? You know how I get into these things? We're probably wouldn't even be hearing joy again after that. I'm just obsessed with that piece. I don't think it's going to take the place at joy. You don't think so? Okay. Let's take one from day. Hello. Yes. Good morning. Mr. Rogers please. Yes. Speaking. How are you? I have to say that I've never had the opportunity to listen to you on the end of the photo, but my husband has. Yes. And so we come home in the evening. Say boy, you should have heard what Neil Rogers said today. And so I have been exated listener for as long as I can remember. Right. And when they told us that Neil Rogers was going to come on, I was so anxious. I could not wait. Are you still anxious? Well, not really. Oh. I have to say that I was kind of disappointed. And I turned the station to another station. Unfortunately, I'm not listening to another radio station. Which one? I turned data back on. Which one are you listening to right now? W. What's with that hard rock station? I need motivational music in the morning. Oh, good. I get up at six and work till noon. So I need some of that motivated stuff. Yeah. This sounds like that other lady says we've got to hear music in the morning. Yes, but I'm going to say that this morning when I turned you on and I heard the Spanish. Yeah. That has really got me cracked up. And I'm going to go back to listening to you and you are very good. Right. In other words, we're going to wait for you. We weren't getting yesterday. I worked on and I just can't wait to turn on the before. It doesn't add something. Voice circle. Yeah. It can't a day. It takes all the credit for that. I said Captain David is all the credit for that. But I really do enjoy listening to you. Sure. Be so excited. I'm really great. Wow. Thank you so much. You all have one too. Oh. Oh. We stopped yesterday, but they were great. We're great. Yeah. Now, what are we doing different today? Estacion. Oh yeah. True. Ten minutes after eight, and let's take another call here from Rower County. Good morning. Hello. Hello. Jack, make me some ears. Oh, Jack. Jack. And I've been to get my movie last night. Little bits and pieces, Jack. Little bits and pieces. Yeah. Like the one they left on a floor, the pieces of nurse ranched, right? It's a friend of mine. They used to be right. How's the chief doing? The chief. The him to pretty good. No, he's been there makes me. He's not all here. You don't you know when the best scenes in a movie is whether getting ready to go in for shock therapy? I do have a head shock therapy. No. No, not yet. No, not yet. No, not good to have tried. You have? Absolutely. Look at that. He just puts a head shock. It's on the floor. No, seriously. They're sitting outside the room and he offers him a piece of gum. Yeah. And the chief says, thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Any looks at him? My new movie, Heartburn. Oh yeah. That's correct. My favorite, Jack. That's my wife's work and I'm out looking for her. You know what I mean? I had a respect. I did find a few good hands. I bet you did. Well, listen, Jack. It's great hearing from you. And it's too bad they had to clean up your act last night. But you know, one of these days it'll be back on the cable we can all look good words. Neo, can I answer one little favor? What's that, Jack? I'd love to hear that piece of the version with you and Glenn. Oh, that may be coming up. But it's the only commercial mystery of radio that gets requests. Oh, no. When you click, you know it. You can say that again. Okay, Jack. We'll see you around a range. Have a good line. You too. That's true. Well, you'll never guess who's online one now. Oh, this is going to get Eric very upset. Hello. Hello, Neo. Yes. Deep throat. Yeah. See what I said? Very upset. If I went through all the dials, I finally found you. Okay. I hope you got some good material today, throat. I said, I hope your material has improved since last week. Just said that. Yeah. Let me say it again. Listen, no, you guys are on great today's back to the normal show. The first couple days, like, I think Glenn thought he was Ron George. He playing with us. Get a form for again, see you. Yeah. I kind of have them. Yeah. Now everyone sees the calm down. The pregnant pauses would make sure so. Don't listen to anybody else about the morning drive. Well, he does look at you all these times. He does look a little like a scam, but that's another story. Oh, no. I just wanted to tell a, uh, Leeds a left since he's a bunch of million, which just strike her. The difference between just strike her and other men is most men carry a condom in their wallet. Jeff carries a wallet in his condom. You guys really do sound good. And I'm listening. I'm up at six o'clock. You're on goes off. I wake up to you. So for the six seconds the other day when no one had a mic on. Yeah. Let me ask you this question. Are we narrow or wide on your radio? Yeah. Good thing. I think it'll be for me in narrow. Okay. You sound great, really. Thank you. Bye bye. Thank you, your son. Why he was, uh, on his best behavior in the answer. Thank you. Yeah. He was good time for the good time for the good time for the great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Good time for the great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. Great. We were unfair to our AM colleagues by the way, even though they did scare the crap out of the whole time. We were unfair last couple of days. And we've been picking on poor Arlene Ross, who is a superstar in her own mind. And, uh, you know, today is the third day. Just like he just said about this show the first couple of days. It's going to be a rocker. Not that comfortable. You try to figure out what the house wrong with all this damn ancient equipment in here. Of course. And now we figured it out and we're used to it, right? Isn't any better but we used to. So we figured that this morning I came in early and I taped a little bit right at five thirty of Arlene's newscast with Michael. But I thought we'd give him another chance, right? Good. To redeem himself. Okay. Well, try one more. I wish I would. Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Can I? Faith. Eight, fifteen. On Zeta Four. You know what can I say? They're just having a good time of there. We're having a good time back here, right? Sure. That's what Gary's here at at a clocking up on. I knew they'd have to be a reason for this. Yeah. I think those people were from an employment service. Quite a way. Some of those illegal aliens who came in, you notice there's more stuff going out of the building? The carpeting is coming in the front. a diversion in the back door. It is like equipment going out and all kinds of good stuff. Okay, let's take another call here from a bulk of by the way is open in case you get a fast busy. That's the way we had no mobile colors again today. You're gonna say no. I don't want max to get upset because I know he's hovering in there, but we are gonna have to replace these lines. Aren't we? Are we gonna have to get to the UFO? You know it's just, you know, you can prolong it as long as you like like another couple of days till we walk down. But sooner or later you're gonna have to get some real numbers and some real lines and like what do we go? I want to like couple extra lines on there, right? Stand warned you about the 550 exchange. Well we haven't had any problem in dating brown that's because there are enough people calling from enough different places. Oh he's listing on delay. Well, I'll tell you what we'll start listing on delay. Is that confusing to you? I'll be honest with you that that's better. It's a little confusing at first. Are you, are you, can you keep up with it? Okay, how's that? Is that? I went into a time war. I enjoyed that. You can't relate to that in other words. You can't walk and chew gum at the same time. You're gonna do that again. And we're just one more time. You see, if you if you just keep going and you don't pay any attention that you can hear how good you sound. Not now you're back to this. Boy, I like that. My head. You can't do that to me. Okay, let's take, I'm just getting even Broward Kelly. Good morning. Welcome to Zeta. Hi, Neale. I followed you over from A.M. Okay, here's not seen. There are a few of these people who actually are A.M. listeners and know what the hell we're talking about. That's great. Now I'm just curious. Do you have to play a certain number of songs? No, no, no, it's matter of fact if you don't like the music, we will delete the one from this hour. Okay. Because it's heart and who will you run doing it? Yeah, we can live without that. Yeah, I'm sorry. Does I think it's ridiculous if you're all your talks. So why would they make you someone want to listen to me? No, wait, wait, they're not making me play a but don't you know that on the A.M. show last several months, we've been playing little music in there? Yeah, well fun songs. No, we also played every now and then something serious. Sure. Okay, no, we remember that. Not too much. Come on. I just thought they were making you do it. No, they don't make me do anything. Okay, that's good. Well, anyway, I'm glad to have you early in the morning when I go to work and I'm going to be leaving now. But you are happy, though, right? Yeah, yeah. We don't we don't sound narrow on the radio and it's not buzzing and you don't have any problems, right? Excellent. Our kind of caller. Okay. Thanks a lot. Hi. Okay. It's 18 on Z. It only a minute ago. It seemed like it was 18 17. It will take one from date County next good morning. Good morning, Neil. Hey, how are you? Okay, I was wondering that just like a song. Is that a bill on a record? I was at the town. Oh, that's a nice young CD on sheety. No, actually, it's from the soundtrack of bigger than life, which I think is on channel six tonight. 33. Yeah, one of those. Okay. Yes, I was interested in buying it. I bet you are. What does the police on pretty good? At least you put you up the show a little bit. That's why he's here. You know viewer discretion is a player. I'm sure there's about 40 birds. Pretty bird. Yeah. But, you know, you sound really good on the air from now to happen. Let's do it for a long time. How come we let that go? Did you notice we just said, yeah, it's okay. Is that it? Okay, thanks a lot. Okay. And don't ever say that disgusting word again. That would have been dumped. I heard. Wouldn't it? No. You wouldn't have dumped out of my show. Okay. Just curious. What do you say? I said, birds. I'm just a bird. All you see, he didn't hear what he said. I heard. I'll tell you later. I'm not going to say it again. It's right. It's right. It's down. Can you spell it, Glenn? Can't he pronounce it? Oh, I see. Can't be very nice. It's like 20 bird. That's what I heard. Yes. It's cool. Like listening. See, we're listening like, uh, off the... I don't. I like my life. Go to that for a second. Does that aggravate you? Well, I go back and do that aggravates you. I'm just not doing it. Well, I tell you, I love it. Anything we can do to make your life worth a dime or less is good with me. Okay. Let's get serious. Now let's vote you up a little bit because it's 20. Oh, those levels I love. I don't want to wake me up a little bit. Okay. Clared my sinuses. Yeah. My wax is all out of my ears. I appreciate that. Oh, no. This is not better. Watch it. I'm going to put you back on delay. You'll be sorry. What a threat. Yeah. Get those headlars down. Is this this worker? Because I don't we call any other than the calling me to max to wake him up yesterday. No, it's busy. Fast busy. Not a fast busy. I think that you. That was a slow business at medium. One more try. It's worth it. Come on. Hey. Well, you know what? I probably will work if I down a right number. Well, you know, it's worth a try. worth a try. This is one of these nine seven six numbers. No, 900. I'll see that's where you're supposed to put your longest in sex. Cascade in. Want to make certain noise? See, he. We're into it. We're dialing instructions. Or ask your an house operator for assistance. This is a recording. I don't want to go for it. Yeah. Same to you. Those those numbers at the best game today. Wait, wait. Look at that. J is got is that a lemon jacket that he's wearing? Yes. You can tell he's been in Florida too long. Can't you? We're going to lemon jacket. What you love when you go into shopping? Well, you see these old guys wearing a lime green pants and a lemon jacket. Oh, boy. It's really something in it. Of course the blue cap that's part of you in a four. Oh, yeah. They're a little blue cap. But like Jimmy Hummel with his green cap. So you see what I mean, Max, get rid of these folks. We can't dial out. We can't have any fun in here. We can't do a damn thing. You know, I mean, so great. He got a new clock. He fixed a pot here. What was it? And put music on hold. Talk on hold. Steps in the right direction. Yeah. But we need more a lot more like to be able to hear ourselves. Or like maybe just, uh, and it's better. I'm telling you, if we could hear ourselves sounding like that, predally, imagine how good the show could be. It sounds great when we hear the delay. Doesn't it? Is it just our match? No, listen to it like that or I could just leave dead air. But like, yeah, it really sounds fantastic. Oh, God. And it's not narrow either in here. It's wide. It's like spacious planes and whatever. Whatever. Yeah. Okay. 27 past date on say to four. Our number is 550 94. Sorry. 550 9490. Just in case and the book align is available. Just in case you don't get a fast busy. And if you're on a mobile phone, don't even try because you're going to get a fast busy. Okay. Just a little advice. Broward. Good morning. How you doing? Great. How what's up? Oh, I'm doing fine. Listen, a couple of things here real quick. What? I have to agree with a guy that says it's so to crazy trying to listen to the delay and the other because I've been doing that now for five minutes that I've been on hold and it is a little nut. Yeah. The other Neil is I'm generally a music person on the FM dial and all that and I just have enjoyed the show a little more than I expected. Let me throw one idea. If you want to put a combined your style with putting out a little music, go for this song that are sort of messages or whatever along the way. Yeah. Like HTC maybe. I don't know. Just crazy things. Harry, Neil's in son of Neil's in got a couple of three. You can pull off it there that I'm sure haven't gotten my care play anywhere. And it's a little like I say political songs or whatever. The ones with more messages and music that you let say. And just counter culture. As they say in a wind cafford, Theria, counter coach. Hey guys, one quick question. Go ahead. Just that it's area. Yopper, you ask a lot of people there, Rachel. I'm 34. You mind telling us how old you are. Me? Yeah. I'm 44. That's not that far off that. Yeah, I'm not that old. Not like Joey. Oh, guy. Like 74. Yeah. I was just sort of curious because I've noticed that there's certain hard rock music that you do like and some that you don't. So I was just trying to figure out where the dividing line. No, no, I like good music, okay? Right. I understand. Now like some of these groups that I want to mention, get Lee upset. But some of the groups are, they just suck. He's a bottom line. Okay. I like most of the music were playing. Yeah. But I guess that I just just there was a couple of things you'd plan that I don't know if you were really serious about painting them or not. Like what? Like what? Oh, what was it? Is that something that you said? No, I like Led Zeppelin. Okay. There was somebody I figured it was someone that I thought was decent that when you said that was the last time maybe you get in play to whatever on your show. Pink Floyd. No, Pink Floyd's okay. It's just a joke with our program. Our program director is obsessed with Pink Floyd. In fact, we got we got money coming up in a couple of minutes by Pink Floyd. Well, with the one that we're talking about. Yeah, all the way. It's all the way. It's all the way. It got fun. It's still a good song. And what was the group that I was ripping last hour? Steela. Oh, yes. Steela. They did it. They suck. Okay. Oh, you're going to love people not with that one. That terrible. Oh, the worst. I heard. I'll enjoy your show. I have a very conservative friend that listens all day long. There's nothing but the talk shows. You were told him that you were coming on. It was like, oh, I said he's rather conservative. And as soon as he told me, you weren't his favorite. I figured you would be decent for me to listen to. Yeah. What is he a Nazi? No, no. Now he's just like I said, he just rather conservative. He's very Republican. Oh, yeah. Like I said, not in a way to be before you write the letters, not all Republicans are Nazis. Okay. Most of them, but not all. I don't know who his favorite talk show host. I don't know who his favorite. I, um, John, but I'm always sort of avoided the talk show. Death of a can. Can't get one. Let's say. So you like Steela, Dan? Not so much. I'm not a favorite. You know, I just, I would look into them. Yeah. Let me ask him about a record. I'm a man by Chicago. Never heard of it, right? Um, not by Chicago. No, see. I told you. I never heard of it either. Everybody here is like, oh, you're no, I think, well, music. You know, and I'm sure I've got it, because I got all our albums. But it's an obscure cut. Yeah. And these people are like, oh, it's a big AOR hit. It was a big EOR hit. Into the road. Okay. EOR. I see these people in, and these AOR stations, they think you got to play obscure cuts that nobody ever heard of before. And that's why they got like fractional shares of the audience, because nobody understands the music. Well, like I said, some of the things that I've, um, oh, what do you laugh about it? It's true. I don't know anything about hearing the help that. Or his means. Of course. Okay. I got the album here. Or not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I should have played take this before. I mean, that's the heck, you know? Sure. That's if you can't come down that hard. Right after we play Frank Zapho, okay? Uh, no. Actually, I can go along with not liking Zapho. I used to like his music and all of that. But I heard him do an interview on another station about 10 years ago. Yeah. And he has such a whole year's in Val attitude. Well, he is probably, uh, he is whole year than we are. We have to according to him. He is. Yeah. That's why his daughter's name is Moon. Yeah. Right. Oh, yeah. Well, listen. I guess I should let you guys get back to it. Yeah. Let's get back to the show. Okay. Yeah. Right. Have a good one. Okay. And don't forget one thing. What's that? Steely Dan sucks. Okay. Okay. Okay. Bye. A 32 and say to four that probably got a lot of the music intensive listeners very upset. We are not music intensive on a show. We have no intention of being music intensive and we play a record when we feel like it. You know, that's it. This hour. We're going to skip it because that lady had a point. We play it when we feel like it. Right. Exactly. Right. And what's wrong with that? Right. Do you want to hear tons of music turn on GTR? You know, Herman and McBeen. They got them out of out of the ocean somewhere. They were hanging out for a couple of months. They put them back onto your head. They said, these guys suck. So don't let them say anything. You know, play a lot of music where they were correct. They were correct in both cases. That's right. So if you want to hear lots of music all on Compagdisk and that's another bunch of crap. Okay. I want Peter to get up said when you're listening to your radio. I've got a great stereo in my car and I got a good stereo in the house. I don't care whether it's on CD whether it's off a record in Edison, cylinder or cassette, a cartridge. If it sounds good, you can't tell. Like that crap we played by the stones last time. Okay, Mother's Little Helper. That sounded like it was come off of a wax Edison cylinder. And it was on a Compagdisk. Big deal, right? I'm on impressed. Are you impressed? No. Are you impressed? Absolutely not. No, it's no difference. It really is an afternoon. It goes through all the processing and all that. It all sounds the same. Yeah, on radio. It's just shock. Great. Okay. We do the radio highlights quickly before Mr. Sports. No, let's even for after Mr. Sports. You always got to hold a little something back. Okay. Okay. That's a good today. And in your case, well, you've got a little intro for Mr. Yes. Yeah, about Mr. Sports. Sure. Do Zeta Foyce, Mr. Sports is brought to you by Carl's Bird and Carl's Bird Lightbear. St. Louis Cardinals in the San Francisco Giants will decide the National League Penetrate tonight when I meet a Bush Stadium in St. Louis. I read. Listen, I want you to listen the audience very carefully and in those of you who are calling in, you're going to be on the spot. I want you to listen to a little music here. How does this on compact this cassette? The scratches is at the record. Is it off cartridge? I'm playing it with art. Thumb nail. See, now I'm just doing this as a demonstration. I still didn't want to step on it. Good record too. Woodstock. She went out playing good stuff like this and a little two-counter cartridge. Crossbow stills an excellent little two-recognizable. So when you call in, you want to tell us if that was on CD, you're a little more maybe. Okay. That's enough. So you get no prizes by the way. They're not giving us anything big yet. Not yet. But boy, any second. You can't hear the, I could hear it. The RF? That's just leaning my head. Just shut up a minute. Is that incredible? Why? Yeah. Why? What a technical disaster. This isn't it? Perfect. Why like RF? Do you? Good. Okay. Let's go back to a Broward County and say good morning. Good morning. Good morning. I got one question. Yeah. What happened to morning radio? Oh. You don't even hear the mic. You don't even hear the music anymore. I like the old record club on Zeta. Oh, good. You're, let's see. What's his number two? We mean number two. You're the second one. I like the old breakfast club on Zeta. This is here the music. You know, this is not a music show, sir. Can you understand that? There are eight million stations playing music intensive formats in a morning. Why? If you guys, because everybody's going to talk in the morning. Oh, yeah, right. There are. Most of the new, most of the stations now. You can't even get 15 minutes of music. You, you have a stereo, sir. Do you have a cassette deck in your car? I do. So what's the problem? I've loaded up. Get some good stuff on it. Like listening to the morning. Yeah. There was a lot of humor in at you, all right. All that intentional. Yeah. Come on. Let's get serious. Will you please? Another ring. They're not going to bring them back. Sir, I hate to break the news. They're not coming back. Not tomorrow. Not a week from circus. They're not coming back. Oh, this is, this is one of the cassette. Yes, slipping the cassette and I hope it doesn't fall out. You want me? You want me to go off? Huh? The 10 o'clock all the morning. Go off? Yeah. Yeah. That's not okay. I can handle it. I just come into work for it. Oh, boy. I mean, this guy likes psychotic. If we don't, if we describe your life, if we disrupted your whole life, sir? It's a little, but that's okay. I mean, you sound like you're having a good time. How long have you been calling in here this morning? I've been on for about 10 minutes and I don't think I heard one song. We're not playing. This is not a music show. Well, that's a M radio. This is not all. That's a M radio. See, Mr. stereo type. That's not a M radio. There's a there's a talk station of Philadelphia that doesn't play one record all week long and they've been doing it for seven years and they've got big numbers. See, you're like, you're like one of those management people. You're locked into this narrow mentality. You think that FL is one thing only. Okay? And up until recently, it was one thing only. We can't say it on the air. You know, we play music from 10 in a morning until six in a morning. 20 hours a day on this radio. Isn't that enough for you to get your fix? 20 hours a day, man. While they rock and roll, banging out the doors and CCR and the stones and the doors and the stones and CCR. 20 hours a day of that crap and pink Floyd and the hurricane Floyd. I mean, you got no sense of humor. You just want to hear the same bapty, bapty, you know enough is enough already. I just knocked my headphones. It's not a good one. Yeah, it was a good. Bapty, bapty. There we go. Hey, we finally got the equipment working. Okay. Thanks a lot, sir. Okay. Good call or you got listen to that. He sound good now. Oh, that's a bad bapty. Bapty. Bapty.

Anyway, I know you're not a big fan of this person, but I did want to let you know that Linda Thornton, right? A good article about you this morning. What do you mean I'm not a big fan? I love Linda Thornton. She's a good fan. I know. You know, she doesn't like to write too many articles about you. But hey, you know, she wrote a nice article on how Zeta was was, you know, how they made a good choice. Yeah, but how am I how my ego better stand only a five share? I'll tell you what if we get a five share in the first book in the morning. We will kiss the walls and kiss Linda over every part of her body. Well, she also really good piece on Stan too. Yeah. You know, Linda's okay. Yeah, she did pretty it. Also, I was to listen to you. She said you want, you know, anybody that wanted to send in a tape. I was in the car.

Just put him back on his perch. Yeah, give us some work to do. So, if anybody else out there wants a cassette of some of Neal's greatest hits. Some of these wonderful little crazy things we play in the morning. On the show, just send us a blank cassette 90 minutes preferred. Blank a set with a stamped self-adressed large envelope, too. The bird. Caravoy WXT and WZTA. There are some x-rated pieces on it. WZTA Miami 33055, okay? Did you get it? WZTA Miami 33055. Gray, and that's to what the hell are the callators of this station? And that's to the bird. To the bird. Ah, no problem. Okay. Maybe self-agree life and keep it up. Okay, thanks a lot. It's soft spot. Dana, Amy Soda. You can now that's good, but not quite enough reverb on there, can't be that. We can't, we can't have reverb in here. I like that. I would love reverb. Okay, is that good? Little feedback?
