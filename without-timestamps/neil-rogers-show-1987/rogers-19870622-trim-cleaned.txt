But just w1, the Miami 33055 and we'll see that you get yours. Okay, we have two open lines in data again, man. The rush is on at base side 624-9400. I'm going to tell you something. We probably ought to have about seven Broward lines, you know? It's going to be as the months go on. It's going to be a lot of diminishing return in date. There are very, very few people who speak at the English in Dave County. Call Gables, hello. Hello, Neil. Here's one of them, yes. Say it, you know, all the line. I never listened to this, what's it doing? Power. A friend of mine called me and said that he's just tune in on the foulery. So he's defending Walton. Oh, no. I call, no. He will, I call up an I2C calls. He was arguing with callers who, and I Walton. So I call them up and I said, say, Mr. Fowler, you say there is no evidence against, oh, against Walton. I said, are you aware of the fact that the files in the garden in Washington show that he signed the instructions to expel 50,000 Greek and Greek Jews? Yeah. To Auschwitz, right? Yeah. He said, I'd like to see that signature to see if it's a common. No evidence against the middle. Don't get me wrong, Mr. Mr. Fowler. I'm not discussing the pulse, business, or anything like that. It's just, just good claim there's no evidence against it. Yeah. And you're disputing it. Don't you understand, wait a minute, sir. Hello. Listen, I want to tell you something. Fowler never met a fascist he didn't like, okay? I gotta say one more thing. In fact, if you hold on one second, we have a little bit of least comments that one of our spies taped today. Yeah. Did you post the desk? Say in Mark. Haven't you not found the desk? For the Zedin sort. Those were some of least comments today. Well, I'm out there with the same thing. I can prove it. I should not follow. Are you sure you don't have a stream of anti-semiters? Oh, little strain. Yeah. He has zero. Get me hung up on. Yeah. Let me tell you something. If you look up anti-semitism in the dictionary, you'll see Lee's picture next to it. I don't know. And I'm not apologizing for that one because I've heard all of his comments over the last two or three years he's been in this market. He is unbelievable. Yeah. I don't doubt it. When will you be patient? The end of the week. We'll miss you. Okay. I'll think of you. Okay. 20 minutes before one at WI and Z stand majors in the building. Stan's going to be here to set the record. Stradies going to be attacking Ernest Sochin and that group of 90-year-old geriatric misfits who Ernest has developed over the last several months. A spy in Boka. Okay. Should we take Tamarack first or Boka? Well, let's take Boka first. Hello. Yeah. Don't take Tamarack at all. Okay. I got the latest scoop. I'm listening to WI of the 1230 update. The upshot. Up there. Here's the latest fish. Rick Weaver has kidnapped Sandy Pays. He's demanding a starting fullback in a bar of toast for her. Safety leaps. That's often this wins by. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. Thank you sir. Okay. Oh boy. There's a stranger role-mo coming from the 79th street causeway. And it's not from Benny Hanna either. I'll tell you that. Unbelievable. Okay. We have an open line. Indeed. Of course. 624. 9400. See what thing about Fowler? You know, I don't think I think he means it. I don't think he's doing it out of desk all the way is desperate from these numbers. But I think he really means it because he's such a douchebag. He's always defending these criminals of one kind or another like this guy. I never can think of this guy's name because he's such a repulsive subhuman individual. They let out a jail in California who raped the girl, a 14 year old girl, and cut off her arms and left her to die. And he's always defending this guy. He did like a week's worth of shows on that before he went away and vacation. He comes back and he's defending the Pope's meeting with Kurt Waldheim. Of course we know that Lee is a practicing Catholic and we do mean practicing. And that, you know, he runs the church every Sunday. If that's going to, you know, they're going to forgive him for the sins that he's doing on that station. Even the Pope himself couldn't give you special dispensation Lee for what you've done to that radio station. Okay. Even the Holy Father can't forgive you for that. So does it come as any surprise that he would defend anything that them, a Pope does. Okay. We have an open line in date. I think I said that 624 9400. The island queen is desperate to hear anything but Glenn's voice. If it's Glenn's voice, no chance. No way. No way Jose. Okay. Stan majors in the building now he's going to decide which Mike Bullm he's going to be using it too. And these ratings are so astronomical now that I just, I don't even know where to begin. Stan takes a lot of credit for the afternoon's of course. Because the gossip, now it's true that gossip was out on the street that he was coming here and there can be no question that the got a gigantic tune in audience, especially in a Haitian community. And all of those people of course have dire reason if they could fill them out. Can you imagine the number we could end? Now that's only a joke. See are they going to be sensitive about that? Huh? No. They accepted their fill. Don't agree. Oh, that's okay. But here we're sitting here. We only had a 977 share in May in midday. And I don't know what we're going to do about that in Alice. Man, you've got some stiff competition in the afternoon stand. I mean stiff. And if Alice drops the dating show, what are they going to do then? They're really going to be floundering and desperate. You heard about Sandy? Boy, what's going on in this market, boys and girls, it's just more than we can handle. It's more than they can handle. That's obvious. Joe. Oh, yeah. Joe Johnson's doing a big job. As a matter of fact, those of you who want to pick on Glenn and his incipit behavior and idiotic Kackle, how about our good friend, Joe Johnson? I'll see, Joe's okay if you put him in a recording studio all by himself for about a half an hour. Let him put together something clever. Fine. But put him on the air live and it's a disaster. It's the end of the world. That's a new format. E.O.W. End of the world. Speaking of the end of the world, the FM numbers are out. Okay. You'll sound good on FM. I'm telling you. You won't have to worry about a mic boom. Congratulations. They have incredible equipment up there. You've seen it. And they have that voice synthesizer. We could make Glenn sound good on the FM. He could sound like lead Gillette. Why aren't you using your new boom? I like the old boom. They asked me this morning when I came in. The first thing I saw in the morning was Rick Edwards walking into the building. And I sat there pondering whether I should go home or come in. What do you mean you ordered it for me? It's exactly the same microphone now. See, we changed the microphone. But it's had big, grotesque boom. Yeah, but that's what it's there for. What? Because it's away from the cart rack and you can move it around when you get your cards and stuff like that. See? I mean, that whole thing is for you. Yeah, I'm sure you're ignoring it. You used the two for stereo. Could we put them on together? Well, no, it's not plugged in. Why don't you plug it in over here on number one? And you're also going to have to look at this. Everything was just fine. See, this is practicing for FM. Wait a minute, don't pull a microwave away. You doosh bag? What a maniac he is. I had it all set. The man just is here. I think it's sabotage. I think Tom like his is paying him off to come back and messed up my show. Okay, now do we have both mics open? How does it sound? Does it sound like FM yet? Yes, you're an A. FF, they show Ellie. And don't you try to play with it on me. You deserve all the credit. You're an asshole tonight. You're an asshole yesterday. You're an asshole tonight. You're an asshole tonight. I've got a feeling. You'll be an asshole the rest of your life. I was talking to you. I was talking to you mother. Just the other night. I told her I thought you were an asshole. She said yes. I think you're right. And all your friends are asshole. Because you know that you're whole life. And somebody told me you've got an asshole for life. Where you born an asshole or did you work at it your whole life? Either way, work not by because you're an asshole. And you're an asshole. Okay, that's number one half. I don't know which one of these to talk into now. They both on. Is this one on to? The guy who came by the day we did the show on a front lawn and had all those needles and all the drugs and was shooting up with everybody on a front lawn. That's the guy he sent this by. Okay, where are we going next? Tamarack. Hello. How are you doing? Okay. I was doing interesting news today. I was down at the sunshine Plaza and low and behold. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. In sunshine Plaza? Yes. Sunshine Plaza. What the hell is that? Well, it's a place for where publics is and a lot of other shops. The quarter four, 41 and all of them. Oh, yeah. Okay. And I was mostly gone down there and normally one sees papers. You know, they give away papers. Yes, but paper never give away. The Harold. Hey, great. Right. And I think I will go there every day, perhaps and get a free house. Anyway, that's very interesting. But once you're more interested, you've got the news on home and down. Please, I know. I'm citing elderly people for. Oh, right. J walking by the dozen, yeah. Yes. And two or three were killed or something like that. Like about a half a dozen since the beginning of the year. Yes. Well, maybe they want to meet the Malcolm Mama's real quick. Evidently, it's the Kamikaze Crossing Sir. It is. Do I personally, they have a new slogan at the Harold. We can't give it away. I was wondering, is this really a gag or a lost little bit of business? No, they lost a lot of business. They're desperate. Their circulation was way down to begin with. And since we've been doing our just saying, no, to the Harold campaign, we have really heard him badly. Oh, that's seriously. That's, that's really. What's the way to do is about standing? You haven't heard? What do you mean the latest news? Go on, even do is I ever heard. That's that she's going to be pumped. She's going to be going with where least place is possibly. What do you mean she's going to be pumped? She's gone. Today? She, oh, you're so far behind. Where have you been hiding all day in a cocoon? I get the latest news last. Okay, okay, here it is. This morning from one of our spies, we got a little bit late about 10 30. Yeah. But it turns out that Doug Young, who is the producer. In other words, he books the guest. He's not a talk host. He's not an on the air person. He's doing her show today because Sandy, you know, they've been jerking her around. Really giving her a rough time. Right. And so she evidently must have got another job somewhere because she told them that she wants to be released from her contract. She had a year and a half to go on a contract. And evidently, the response was, I was at the level. So she's gone. She has gone. And Mike Miller, of course, is finishing out his last week and a half. So they're like, um, flattened to say, floundering would be a compliment. Yes, but there goes a star is going to be a rising in July. Who's that? Don't you know? No, we don't say his name. I know. The great man. He may not, he may not come back from one of those restaurants in Italy. He may not be on vacation. Oh, yeah. He's been over in Italy. I got a card of naked, the statues from him. Every time he goes over there, he sends me a postcard of naked statues. Oh, well, who's going to be selling in for his beyond his time? They got between two and four. We're going to go a stroll in the morning. You're asking me? Maybe Lee's father might move over. Do you need a job? Oh, I, I gladly volunteer. Well, I'm going to start a rumor. This is totally unsubstantiated. But since there's so many rumors flying, I heard in, through the grape mind, I just made it up. The new midday host on Wiod. Harvey from Kendall. Well, let's put it this way. You can find them for $2,000 a year. Yeah, sounds good to me. That's good to do everything. But isn't she going to be moving over to? I would think so, yeah. Well, maybe they can hire Ron Sacks. Are you here trying to be going? Well, if they hire Sandy, wouldn't you think that, I mean, who the hell knows? You know, they all keep changing and changing and changing. It's enough to make it dizzy. Just can't keep track of what's going on in this town. Well, maybe the good news might be that maybe there might be some way to, a lot of the control support. Maybe they might want to buy W News to make it a Spanish station. Yeah. Sounds good to me. And then there would only be Sandy Payton. And then there would be WS and Wions. And basically that's it. Okay. Okay, that's terrible. No, it was fine. Boy, that's this. Danya, hello. Hi, Niel. First of all, I am not a new listener. I have been following you all over the doll for years. I'm surprised you haven't noticed by now. Yeah, I can tell. Really? I see your trail everywhere I go. Yeah, you probably can't. But I'd like to tell you, it's just been fresh about I can't for the herald years ago. And it took me about six months to get in to stop delivering it. I finally had to go down to the office. Yeah, they're like the sun sentinel in reverse. The sun sentinel it takes six months to start showing up with a paper. The herode you can't sell it. And for six months they insist on delivering it. Absolutely. I couldn't turn them off. They just kept bringing it every day, every day. It was ridiculous. Yeah. But the second thing I wanted to tell you is we've had something happened to us. My family and I in a restaurant last week that brought you to mind. It was unbelievable in a restaurant in Emerald Hills. And New Delhi that opened up in Emerald Hills. Yeah. We went in just for dinner. We didn't know anything about it in the early bird or anything. We just went in for dinner. The only thing we discovered about the early bird was they had it listed on the menu. So we sat there. We ordered sandwiches and other things. Well, wait a minute. Is that the early bird chirping in the background? I believe. I have a lot of early birds here. So we're sitting there eating our dinner about seven o'clock and just sitting there eating it like you normally wouldn't. All of a sudden, over a loudspeaker that was just enormous. Chicken croaking noise. And they announced the early bird of all for the early bird. Yeah. And we looked at each other and we said new rogers. He said no, but that was good. God. It was either the end of the early bird of the beginning of the Santa Rear ritual. One of the other. It scared us. Yeah. We're going to be like, oh, people jumped on believable. That is telling you. Anyway, if you ever want to go there, it's the Hills Valley and it will heal. And it's a lot of sun. It's seven o'clock in the evening. Okay. Okay. I'll see you there. Okay. Don't write that down because I didn't give them a plug. Okay. We have one open line in Broward 524-9400. Oh, we had another elderly fatality this weekend. And Helen Dale Beach Boulevard. We just had that from our J walking patrol. And we had another tragedy in Helen Dale as the Kamikaze crossing continues as popular as ever. Okay. We're going to come back for one more hour after Mike Wolf brings us those award winning headlines. CBS with the news at the top of the hour. And don't forget. Like it. Participate on today's program. You can call Neil on 624-9400 in date or 524-9400 in Broward. And now here again, Neil Rogers. Hey, baby. I'm feeling cattle home. Neil has never seen I think you'll enjoy it. Excellent. I'll look for it. Okay. Thanks a lot. One-on-one at Winds. Let's take a collect call from Stan Major's favorite resort from the Bahamas. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. This is my second down call of how are you? How are you? Good. And then you go on vacation next. You coming to the Bahamas? Yeah. I'm coming to NASA as a matter of fact, the gamble my brains out. What about free board? Then I'm coming to free port with all my winnings. Neil, one day I was listening to you, right? And you were ripping this guy in size. I'd like to know who he is. Sighoy? No. Sighoy. Oh, yeah. He's an insurance salesman in Broward who doesn't like me, but can't turn off the show. Guy knows that the sister you was calling them on. Missed it. I stopped human fart. No, I didn't say that. You said it. I might have said a subhuman missfit. What about a moron in the jerk? No, I didn't say that. Neil, I have to save what's right here. Okay. What would have happened? I had trouble things to ask you. How do you think he felt if he was listening to this? They probably felt natural. Huh? Well, if he'd stopped calling us and bugging us and stopped whining in Kyle's ear, we wouldn't talk about. I mean, you can only judge people by the way they behave. And he behaves like a moron in a jerk. I just was cured because this day I was listed. I said, I'm mad of Guy. I'm really amazed that you would bring him up. He's so obscure and he hasn't called us in a long time. I think he has, oh, no. He hasn't. Cause that he hasn't called. So let's sleep in dogs lie as they say in high. Yeah, when we can go down to the sun, as we're a lot of play tennis and you always listen to you down there. Excellent. While I were big in the Bahamas, they love Stan Major down there too. No, we like you better. I would hope so. And I don't know. I don't know. Some wrong with him. I know it. Well, he just has bad taste. You got to understand if Stan knocks you, that's like a boost. A-ha. Because Stan likes a Don Johnson and Madonna. And these horrible live performance records. You know, Stan has just got bad taste. So Stan says that Bahamas is bad. You're probably getting hold big influx of business. What are we going with Madonna? What's wrong with her? She just looks like her. That's all. She's a slob. Am I wrong? She's a tramp. Hi, Neil. Is this Madonna? Go. Okay. It sounds a little bit like her. This is Nicole. How you doing, Nicole? Fine. How are you? Good. How are you doing? What's happening, darling? Making a lot of money from all those suckered tourists? Bill? Yes. I deal with them all wrong. What? I deal with them all wrong. Oh, boy. I like to you. I mean, they do have early birth specials down here. You should see them caving in on that. Good. Well, we got a whole bunch of people from Helendale. We're going to send down to see you. They come from, we get a lot of them from Miami from Florida and Holland. They'll come. Yeah. I work in a hotel. And I have to deal with them. They always ask me where the early births are. Oh, boy. That's those are from Florida. Yeah. They own the road. Don't you understand that. They own the world. Yeah. They like the whole world is just a big early bird special. Uh-huh. They like to run these moped and they don't know how to ride them. Yeah, we have a few of them laying up in the hospital right now. I would think so. Yeah. Well, that's a good idea. We might be a sense of moped's over to Helendale. You might have had the suggestion for our problem. Yeah. I can just see all the AKs in Helendale, writing their moped's across Helendale Beach, Boulevard. That makes them a much easier target. Okay. Well, listen. It's good hearing from you. Okay. And I hope you make a lot of money off all those suckers today. Oh, that's not suckers. Okay. Have a good time. Whatever you say. Bye-bye. One-third-teen at WI and C here is speaking of Helendale, a young man trapped in the city of choice. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay. You're right. You know? I guess people like me just learn to avoid, you know, avoid the city, and you know, kind of get away, go to Palm Beach or Miami or whatever. What do they do? Lock you up in a cage when you're in Helendale? I kind of like myself up. Yeah. Yeah. Good thing. Get out to the button. Sounds nice and a while. All right. What I called the Ask You Bought is totally different from the subject here. I want to know what you think of Pat Boone taking Jim Baker's place for the PTO. Oh, I think it would be great. I think when we release 8 million of those pictures with the Boone in the box, I think it could be one of the great scandals in a history of America. I mean, I can't believe what I'm seeing on TV here. Yeah. You know, Jim Baker's scandal, and then I saw the Pat Boone picture like two years ago, even before you came out of it. And I'm watching, I say, Pap Boone replacing Jim Baker. My God, what's happening to you? You know, evangelistic TV. Uh, and you get my point? Yeah, I get your point. It's getting smaller by the minute. Yeah. But anyway, um, I was wondering about that. I think what they need to do is hire John Holmes to be on a PTO. Well, that's probably the next step I got, right? Going from one extreme to another. You know what Jerry Falwell said. He said that the donations were down to peanuts. So that's probably why they're thinking of Pat Boone. It was probably a subliminal suggestion. I can't, you too much, Neil. You really are. You're great. I love you. That's what Pat Boone said, too. Well, sorry. I don't have any scar boxes around. So I can help you out. That's a good suggestion, by the way. Maybe we can send Jim Baker or a cigar box. And we can have a Jim and a box. That would be great. Maybe that's the way Jim's going to get his, um, his, uh, ministry back. He and Pat are going to have a Boonoff on TV. Okay. Well, listen, hang in there. Okay, babe. Stay tuned for the latest. Okay. Okay. Another call from the city of choice. To an arrow. This must be sunny Rosenberg. Hello. Hello. Yes. Hi, Neil. Yes. I think I have a problem to your early bird's special in city of Hellendale. Okay. Well, I've been hearing that you've been coming down hard on sunset. He all morning long. Not me. Huh? Not me. I love it. Oh, I know. I said, why? Only when they use pan. You know, they're going to get mad at you. And what they're going to do is, uh, they're going to sacrifice a lot of chickens. Okay. And that means you, there's not going to be any more early bird's specials. Yeah. It's a good point. Isn't it? Yeah. Well, just, you know, I just thought I know. Just a thought. I know it is. It's a thought. Okay. Maybe we can promote Santaria and Hellendale. Yeah. How about that? We can put the early bird right out of business. That's for fuck. Okay. All right. Thank you. We have a real creative audience. Okay. Good name. I'm going to be admit it on between 10 and 2 in the morning. I sure hope so. I mean, your room a mill hasn't come up with that yet, have you? Yeah. All we've had every room around the sun, yeah, the room is that he can do 10. I thought he'd see that one come true. Yeah, I would too. Because you were languish him. I would think so. Now listen, I have another grime. Unless there's a run on the Michael Disisto school. Oh, yeah, that's another merry. Sorry, if they guide him with him. This Michael Disisto doesn't come on the program. He has no program. Or professional wrestling is one of the other. Oh, please. Anyway, I have a gripe to pick with you. When is that article coming out and people magazine? Well, evidently, it's not. Don't pick it with me. Pick it with them as my cranary would shape. Pick it with them. Huh? They dumped it. They did. Yeah. For some stupor, you're time. For some stupid thing, like, you know, Gary Hart and Donna Rice, or some little thing like that. I guess they dumped us. Oh, too. I'm sorry to hear that. I was thankful with the reader. Well, what can I tell you? Okay. You take it easy, kid, and if your room becomes up with that suggestion, I'd be glad to hear about it. I can't wait. See you later. Right. Okay, 118 at WI and Z. We have an open line in date, 624, 9400, 624, 9400. Let's take our first break of this last hour, and then we'll come right back. 121 at Wins are next call from the Latterdale Lake. Hello. Hi. Hi. Oh, no. Are you talking about Madonna? The, uh, what, I wanted to see if you could help the settle on arguing around here. They hear under our, right? Yeah. Road test. Hey. We're slow. I was going to ask you about, so may I use to feel the same way. But now it's like neither here nor there. I don't know. No, no. It's neither here nor there. It's all over the place. Right. Or a condition on that though, right? I mean, we are under 150 years ago, women didn't shave on it. They thought they were still alone. Yeah. Well, she would have been great 150, no, maybe like 500 years ago. But you think it's just ugly in itself for, well, to each zone. I mean, if there are people like body here, you know, she's got to be the catch me out. This is the argument. I'm saying that, um, you know, it's not just a naturally ugly thing. Otherwise, uh, oh, come on. It's like that or something. You know, we would why? The women would have evolved with her to put not under their own emotional, but we, you know, the culture started. Yeah, but you wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Human beings are evolving into having a lot less here. You do realize that, don't you? Yeah. I hope. Yeah. But while coming in aren't, uh, you've all been once less here than that. They are. Are they are? Huh? Are they Irish? No, on their bodies. I mean, it all depends, you know, depending upon the gender, it depends on how much you've got. But she evidently is very butcher. I don't know. Okay. One, one out of a little question. I mean, I mean, probably the way to find out if you run into a female truck driver, you know, I see check out her armpits that she's got a lot of hair. You'll find out maybe you're right. Well, not necessarily a turn on, but I don't know. He's not such a big turn on. Well, first of all, even if you wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's slow down. Slow down a minute. If you took all the hair off of her body, everywhere. Yeah. Okay. For the sake of argument. Just look at her face. Look at her from the neck up. She's a slut. She's ugly. Well, I guess it's a gallon of shit. Oh, come on. Let's be honest. She's ugly. Well, she's not beautiful like Grace Kelly, but she's not beautiful like, like, like any of her, like Dr. Ruth. She's gross. I don't know. No, you gotta understand with that. I'm glad to be objective. With today's generation, decadence is in. That's what it's all about. So the more gross test you look, the more they like it. It's, you know, it's their idea of like the 60s of rebellion, counter culture. This is their idea of looking gross. I saw a couple of young girls who could have been attractive by the way in the, in the, in the Broward Mall the other day. And they had, you know, the mall hawk and the whole business and this growth test, the punk, the horrible look. And they look like something from out of a freak show and they think that's great. Yeah, I see that. Oh, forget it. Well, anyway, can I ask you a quickie here? Who is that person that I can't remember his name right now? Would you do just a short impersonation of his, it sounded kind of like Bruce Williams at first, but it's one of the people that worked there, I think. Anyway, it's hilarious. Yeah, I wish you'd do more of it. I don't know who you're talking about. He kind of talks like, yeah, well. Oh, Jerry Witchner doesn't work here. Yeah. You're a Witchner. Yeah. Now he, he works at W. snooze. Okay. I wish you'd expand about that, and that's hilarious. Okay. Thanks a lot. Thanks, Ola. Yeah, Jerry is going to go into the butchering business when he gets off the areas. He's already butchering the English language. But boy, things are not good in his numbers. I'll tell you that. Talk that destroyed him in the month of May. I mean, just put him to sleep. Destroyed. I mean, they're doing average quarter hours of about 41,000. And he's doing 12,000. Come on, Jerry, get serious. Miami, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. It's the Donna Wright's picture in the paper today. No, I sure didn't. What did I miss sir? Oh, it's in the Miami news. And she's at the Grand Prix in Palm Beach with Bruce Jenner. Oh, boy. What an exciting team they make. Yeah, it says they're conversing while watching the Grand Prix. What were they doing eating weedies together? It's probably checking his Grand Prix. Yeah. Well, she's big on those. So just be here. Yeah. I agree with you about base. Why don't you think to fail on Miami? Or anything to fail to bring it to Miami? Absolutely. Wait till we have the Miami heat. I mean, I'm going to tell you something on a scale of zero. Their chances are minus infinity. They might have turned the arena into a warehouse. Exactly. Forget it. Or something that sounds like warehouse. All right. All right. All right. I'll see you at base side. 26 past one had very little comment about base side. That's a big story in the news today. That's the everybody's gnashing their teeth and ringing their hands. Like it's some kind of a big surprise. They don't understand. This is a flash town. Period. People get excited about something for a short period of time. That's it. It's audio. A reaver there. Adios. And it's just like this show today. We got three open lines on the board now, which is a very bad sign. I mean, it's a sign that just enough to make you go into cartwheels. We have one open line in Broward 524-9400. And we have a couple of open lines in date. We have six 24-9400. And we better get them all lit up. Otherwise, major will come on here at two. And I'll say that I did something in the last hour to drive away his whole audience. He's got to have somebody to blame every day. It's frightening. Now, you just came racing in here with your WI and Z coffee cup. As if we're going to open your microphone. Tweety bird will not give up today. All I got an idea. These are very directional mics. Here's a good idea. Now, seriously. Let's do this kind of like step by step. It's like a little tease. You know how when they do the news, they like to tease the big stories of the day. They tease the audience. Oh, first before we do that, let's take this collect call from Nassauk as we're paying a fortune for it. Hello? Hi. Hello? Hello? Are you in Nassauk? Yeah, I'm first time calling. Great. How you doing? All right. What's up? That's it? Good. I just want to sound like the beginning of an exciting call. I just call the tell you that I listen to your show. Every day, me and my dad beats it down. Listen to your show every day. Fantastic. Well, we love you, Bahamas people. Man, it's great. Yeah. It's really hot down here. It's hot? Yeah. How does hell I bet? Yeah. No, I know. So how's business? This is all right. We all look a store. Oh, I bet you do. I bet you do a big business, huh? Yeah. I bet after all those Americans come down there and plunge their brains out in paradise island in the casino. They come over and get smashed out of their mind, right? Yeah. Well, now we're at a summertime. It's coming. We've gotten even more customers than last year. Really? My God. Well, those are probably all the people who left the base side. They're on the way to the Bahamas now. We got like four thousand customers last year. And this year's like about six hours. Because we keep a racket of everything. Holy moly. As they say in high allia. Mm-hmm. Well, that's great. I'm glad that business is booming and we're going to be down to see you. Okay. What's the name of your store? No, we better not do it, huh? No, we're not. Okay. Well, whatever works for you. Okay. Okay. Good luck to you. All right. Bye-bye. Well, we're big down there at the Bahamas. No, when I was starting to say only moments ago. The only reason I took the call and said, collect on the screen. And we're very cheap out there. We're not going to, you know, sitting here with an 85 share. And open line in each county. If you'd like to join us ladies and gentlemen in date county, 624-9400. And in Broward, 524-9400. Let's keep them filled for Stan. In fact, if you want to talk to Stan, you can call in now and put John Hold. And then Kyle will clear the board it to a clock. I had an idea. Turn on his mic for a minute. No, no, we're not going to turn it around. Okay. Because these are very directional mics. Is it on? It's on. And it's useless. Because they can't hear you. It's face the other way. Don't touch it under penalty of death. Under penalty of tackle removal. Now, you might tap on it a little bit. Yeah, that's good. That's as close to hearing Glenn today as you're going to get. Oh, your, is this his boyfriend? What's a matter? He wants to bribe us. What are you going to give us to put Glenn on the air? What's the deal? What? Come on. What is it? Well, I'm going to give you a Neil Rogers Voodoo doll from his Santa Rea priest. It will put you on the air. No, that's not good enough. How about if you bring us a live Jason Getrick doll? Would that be okay? Front page of the Miami. And the Harold? A hastened daily news. Yeah, and he made the front page of Santa Rea, Richard. He did. All right, so come on down. Stand next week on Friday evening. We're having a little ritual down. I know. He'll be there. And by the way, send us a couple clippings of your hair and two. We need to figure nails in an envelope. Okay. Okay. I'll leave. See you later. 24 before two at WI and see Mr. Kackel over here. Just starting the loser. He's starting to do absolutely fall apart at the seams. He is. He's losing it because we've kept him off mic for four almost four hours today. Let's see a show on the phone of all the people who are delighted that we've kept Kackel box. Well, hey, listen, that's net picking. They're already all lit. Now there's one in Broward. It's not lit. Come on. Let's see from all those people who really are tickled a death. That the S.E.S.E.L. It's lit already immediately. And immediate show of strength from the Broward audience. Boy, they are thankful. They're grateful. They're going to be sending us gifts. Finkens in some mirror. Just for keeping you off the year for one day. It's like we give them a bonus. Sweetwater. Hello. Yeah, I'm sorry. I had you on speakerphone. Okay. You say what, sir. I just called. I had never listened to your show. This is the first time I really enjoy it. Are you serious? Where have you been? Guess where. WI-O-D. Oh, my God. Another Sandy. You must be in hysterics. Well, I'm not exactly. No. I'm not getting all tired of it. Anyway, because just like a lot of other people say the switch switch switch you never know when you turn the radio on. Exactly. Exactly. You have to have a big score card and a gigantic rubber eraser with the IOD lineup. And it was getting to be a pain in the neck. It almost seemed like Chuck Tanner is the manager over there at IOD. But I just, or I'll say, I like your format. I like the way you're running your show. Very similar to the Will callers. Exactly. And I, you know, he likes it. I can't say I played tell us in him anymore. So I'm going to have to start listening to your show. Well, I'll tell him that you said so. Okay, don't keep. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. You hear that bill? There's somebody out there who likes you. Caller doesn't carry. He had a big day at the track yesterday. By the way, speaking of the ball games in Chuck Tanner, I heard the shot that both of you took at Meera was on Friday, I think. When Stan was so desperate that he brought the invited big Kackel box to come in a studio. Watching ball games on the cable. No. For watching ball games. I loved watching ball games. That's wrong with that. I was not desperate. You had not allowed him on your program. Yeah. Well, that's a man. Then today you ought to have him on for four hours. I would know. You're sticking around today. For briefly. What is this briefly, Jazz? You made it come up my last week. You haven't been on my show lately. I haven't been on my show lately. I can't be. That's not true. The first day I was almost the whole show. When you were begging, when you were in security. No, I just want to know what my mission to push. In addition to push. In addition to which most of your callers don't like me anyway. I hear all that stuff. Oh, man. How did he have a purse? I hear all that stuff. No, I don't have a purse. Although, you know who used to work here. Who does have a little purse? Larry Kent has a little purse. He does. Jerry Williams has one. Jerry Williams has a purse. I think Don Johnson has one. Oh, yeah. We know Don Johnson's got one. You can see it in that picture. Oh, you mean a purse? That's what we're going to do tomorrow. What do you think about guys with earrings and purses? That would be a good show and tattoos. What do you think about women with tattoos and earrings and bones in their nose? Are you better put plan on shows dying? What's wrong with? No, it only died since you came in. What's wrong with watching? What's wrong with watching baseball? Mr. Sports, Chuck, over here. Oh, watching the exciting Atlanta brave. I like the brave. Oh, brazer. Good ball club. No, I don't just like the humor. That's a sexual thing for the humor. That's very true. There's no question about it. I admit it. And if you've got a song number, we'll call him right now. We'll call him and Steve Isherman. We'll get him on together. And I can have a little excitement on the show. Finally. I even like the ugly players on the brave. It's how's that for being an equal opportunity fan? You don't become a fan of a team because the players are good looking. How could I be a pirate's fan all these years? One of the prerequisites are playing for the pirates. You've got to be extra ugly. I'm having a tough time this year though because I'm still a Phillies fan. Oh, good luck to you. I know. I love the match and I watched a lot of the match. Well, that's why I can't love the Cubs or former Phillies. See, the Phillies have some good looking players. That's why they never do anything. You have to get ugly players. At the end, more guys like Mike Schmidt who are real ugly. And at Guy and Wright Field with the glasses.
