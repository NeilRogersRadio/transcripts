You Get their voices on them there really makes my balls That chrome man. He's harder than my bread brothers Show it. So let me ask you the first question what the hell time is Chris more on anyway It's 1003 on 560 QAM and we got a Coxies army in here to Lex you've never seen anything like this You think there was something going on here today, which they're just might be and it's a major miracle Let me say it again George Corso is God now. Would we be here today for work for this one poor guy? That's right even our George is like got the clap in there for me's clapping in the acumen And this man did five people's work nine o'clock last night We finally got the last well not the last but close to the last piece of equipment in here and It's a major miracle one man so powerful so amazing so miraculous and he wears an earring to how do you like that? So we got the seven months worth of material to cover here. You know Ellie Brecker I had all the other stuff I want to talk about that. Of course. We got the Harold and we know how much we love the Harold There are favorites and she comes up with Ellie. I mean seriously could you ever get anything right? I love you you're a sweet person, but stay to hell away. You know what I mean? This is just unbelievable. She has an article in here this morning Little bit late, but better late than ever, but Ellie Brecker that's fucking bitch has got a thing in here That says I'm talking about the fact that you know There was a few delays here over these past they only had seven months to get this done not a long time Not a long time for a project that you'd take about three weeks But they only had seven months to do it and they kept giving us one day. It's gonna be done December 1st It's gonna be done December 8th. It's gonna be done December 15th positively December 16th 9 o'clock last night the 29th or freaking December We get the last piece of equipment here so we can do the show see their idea of doing a show is you walk into a Delapidated old flea bag like Hank keeps telling you it is over there a QAM you sit down with a mic and a board that Mark Kony would be embarrassed by and You flip the stuff open and you're trying to look good then that's being on a radio, okay? We are here to drag the beastly read people out of the Stone Age of broadcasting into at least a 19th century anyway 20th would be a little bit too much, but how about the 19th okay? How about those big old final tubes that glow real bright? You know the ones it we used to see in the transmitter K. T. Artsmith Rreston Be's by the way, you'll be excited to know I was a little bit down because we you know I'll tell you this John do you expect from Channel 4 this man is obsessed Obsessed we even came in here today. Let him press our buttons and we're all over the TV all you got to do is let these TV people come in press your button and Man you get all the free time you want four was all over at Hank testicle a channel 6. He was all over this thing One minute the editor from Channel 7 he was here on something called by the way. He's both call back who did Ricky Sanchez or Ricky Tickey Yeah, that's another exciting worth it, but at any rate So all these other in Channel 10 nowhere to be found come to find out and left it in her will you know, and that's fucking bitch She's another one left it in her will that anybody a channel 10 gives Neil Rogers that fat-fag Look who's talking sweetheart any publicity is out is out. How do you like that? So from her grave, but I noticed that there's a pretty cheap mic too by the way Channel 10 finally made it here today They're all here the TV people are here. You think that something was actually going on then Ellie Brecker comes to a If there's nothing else going on just keep in mind We might even have to subscribe to the Harold you can always get a copy of the Harold and go for four hours non stop on the crap That's in this pain non stop crap She says Says a resign Greg. Oh, he resigned. No what are he's not here this week a resigned Greg Reed QAIM's vice president General manager. He's gonna carve me up It's been a lot of discussion about stuff he thought was major that we thought was minor Everything to him is life and death. He had a lot of time on his hands. Yeah I got something on my hands all right Greg and eight time you know I'm talking about a lot of masturbation what I mean Yeah minor things minor things like are we gonna have a studio to work in that you promised you know I mean when somebody comes to you and makes all kinds of representations You know come to work for me. I'm gonna build your studio We're gonna do this we're gonna give you all this money and then you have to go stand on your head to get them to live up to the promises Then I guess it's only minor things you know like nine o'clock last night We're in here practically are we gonna go on when when do you back from channel four was here yesterday morning And I said to him I said you know if we go down tomorrow will be a miracle and it is a miracle It's a freaking miracle ladies and gentlemen that we're on a year here today It's one of the most astonishing things the pyramids was a piece of cake compared to this Because basically what they did was they had one guy do the job of five people and then they gave them like half the equipment Which of course wasn't block brand new? I mean some of the real cheap stuff Yeah brand do but the expensive stuff came from the other beesleast stations in places like Norfolk, Virginia and Canada, England, New York some of the big bee'sley markets and so they shipped down to us a little bit here a little bit there And that was basically it so poor George Corso had to work a one-man engineering department We're gonna build a statue to him Of course the main problem is we might not be on the layer long enough to finish it all depending on a damn new that competition I mean the stupid talk network this thing yeah I thought seriously after Paxon I thought I could never see any more incompetence stupid people in my life Guess what surprise first I came over here and then Then we see what clear channel is doing don't let me forget that I would do thing that's got to be on immediately if not sooner Here is the death of one of America's most unique amazing radio stations in history in fact today in honor of Wiodeader They came Paxon butchered it slaughtered it ripped it raped it tortured it Harry Valentine Harry penis Walter Sabo Peter Bolger nice ass socket by the way, you know, it's how Peter Bolger started with with the I-N-Z he was with that other cup Whatever the hell the name was with the guy Gannett then he moved on to Paxon and now thank God He's still with clear channel as he continues sucking his way up the corporate ladder destroying everything in his way Pete you're not fooling anybody sweetheart on freaking believable So clear channel comes in and their infinite wisdom They take a station that's been talk and entertainment for like the last 4,000 years and they're gonna make it the New station did you see Mike Wolf and that by the way Mike is a good guy's got a great voice good news man married to the boss a good guy He is his married to the boss. He's married to Rhana Wolf. Okay. I think a jewel like her changing name to wolf just for the hell of it God get with it, but anyway, he's on the news last night explaining the new format and why they made the big Swayesh between the I-O-D and I-N-Z and about how the signal about Papa and moon up your ass I mean Kimmy a break already. What year this is the dumbest damn thing and of course we're not complaining And that stupid talk network lineup. I feel sorry for Suds. I almost said Rick and Suds. I don't feel sorry for Rick. Oh, sorry Rick. No, I actually to show you what a decent guy I am in what a good mood. I'm in from the great time I had for several months I even feel sorry for Rick which is saying a hell of a lot Yeah, exactly. Oh, man, is he gonna be pissed Rick we just thought this is payback. He stole all my stuff for the last this seven years Why not steal one thing from his show? Yeah, he's gonna say we stole that too. You can have it back, okay? But I feel sorry for those guys following. Let's see four Six nine hours of dead air. How'd you like to come on following nine hours of dead air? Mr. Ego doing his old tired lightbulb stick and then of course they have to explain I have to take like a half an hour to explain you well if you're driving on the coast between A1A in this street like a turn to fourteen hundred if you're like two blocks south to nine forty and if I mean What they hello these people talking about only clear channel? They have put packs in the shame even though that packs a stock's down to seven or three quarters by the way But they they have put them to shame But packs in is a moron and he's a genius Compared to the people are clear channel. So thank you God. Thank you Lord. Thank you Whatever the hell is out there for getting me the hell out of there just in time and for all those wonderful times the last seven months You know what I'm talking about a lot of masturbation. What I think exactly? Love it after ten on five sixty QA and my first sponsor and this is great because we're always talking about food And I've got a sponsor that you're gonna go nuts about Mama Mary's gourmet pizza crust now you can go to Italy and go all over the world And you know, it least got some pretty damn good pizza. I'm not gonna lie about that But if you want some great tasting pizza right there at home now There's another another company begins with a bee. I don't want to say who's with a bee. Well, let Mickey Dane do that But you know the one I'm talking about where they make those airzots pizza crust that pretty weak But mama Mary's that when I first came into the studio about a month ago And I met with these people and they said well, you know, they showed me the pizza crust They have a 12 inch big one. They have got a seven inch small one. I said I got a smaller one than that and They're amazing. I took them home and actually tried them. Mama Mary's pizza crust Have a no spill edge so you put the assauce on there. You put your mozzarella and then whatever you like You put your pepperoni and anchovies whatever toppings you like ten minutes You're ready to eat on the best pizza you've ever had right in your house even better than delivery Much much better a million times better than frozen you will be amazed they're faster They're easier they're better for you because they're made with honey and the pure ingredients instead of sugar and Much less expensive than the competition like I said You'll find two sizes to choose from the 12 inch party pizza or the seven inch personal size pizza and if you want to find it and believe me You're gonna love it. All you have to do is look in the deli-silus section of your local supermarket or ask for it by name Mama Mary's gourmet pizza crusts Goodbye, I owe thee the memories of all that's left of a station that once had been and for a Am that was quite a clean All the taxi were insane To blow it all in when they build those condos and blocked that tower off You'll be lower down into your grave and You were great at one time, but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind And you'll never see numbers you can sell again You hurt yet clear channel those what they're doing But no one's listening anymore Because they really Are you sure Goodbye, I owe thee let go a Gregor Skip the plupor in the rest of that retarded team that remains attacks and so will receive Oh Clear channel has a scheme But it's clear to see that despite all their corporate and big names they can't hide the fact without Theo they got a crappy deal And you look great at one time, but now you sound more like a signal drifting in the wind And you'll never see numbers you can sell again That clear channel knows what they're doing Also they think But no one's listening anymore Because they really Easy Oh, thank God for clear channel, baby.

What was the big story with princess Diana? That f***ing bitch.

You know under her breath She's muddering because they hated each other like poison which they did and the media people you people are crazy Oh, that's right channel 10. He's the rabbit not don't take it personal But the people in the media are crazy and they're spreading their sickness all over the world because they got the NBC stupid channel And not affiliated with a stupid talk network by the way and they got CNN international they got C-C-N-B-C is all over the world so the spew them that they spread here in America They spread all over the world simultaneously so they're telling the public basically what is important and what you should be excited about and what is not?

Now, you notice what I said before about the fact that my being off the year for seven months, much more significant to the despratos out there than it was to me, even though I enjoyed it very much, it was a real bonus in my life to get paid. Oh my god, are these people starting to look a lot better every day of my life? God bless you, full. You know, there's an old saying, the grasses greener on the other side. What I'm talking about, and green there it is. It's pretty green right there. Bob Green and Cheryl and the old entourage from the real WOD, which by the way, they're glad that they changed the format, but which they would change the call it, which by what queer channel is doing, to what formerly was a wonderful, in fact just one more time for the West Coast. Unbelievable. What's happened? How many months it was like 12 months? And not even two years. In two years, they've gone from great to mediocre to non-freaking existence. Thank you so much, buddy, PUD and queer channel. Man, you guys are just absolutely incredible. I've never seen anything in a business like in my life. I've seen everything.

The March of Dimes gave Greg O and award for what? Talk to how his girlfriend smelled and looked in the consistency of it. They don't pick the people. They just collect the money for the Dinders. Man, oh man, outside of the day, they have really put a new Kink into a radio over there and make no mistake about that. The bad part about this is we're not going to be able to hear a large ass. Here is a, here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes. God. How you doing, sir? I've been counting it since you left. A lot of masturbation went on. Yeah. Neil, I've missed you so much. I've been waiting. That's why there's been so much more moisture in the ears since I was off the year. People are looking for something to do to keep busy, I guess. Oh, man, Neil, it's great to hear you back. I mean, that's really all I call the tell you. And, you know, I hope that they go down in flames. Everybody but Rick and Suss. Yeah. Don't you feel, I mean, let me ask you something. Seriously, I'm not suggesting you're a programmer, but in this business anybody can be a programmer. You're dragging them off the street. That's what they used to do with IOD. But at any rate, you, you, you, I mean, if we've had an IQ bigger than your little finger, I mean, look at this lineup, they got Mr. Ego doing jury-electric talk in a morning. And, of course, he's on 14, 100, he's on 12, 90's. I mean, you got to have a roadmap and a compass to find out which station which one is on. And, of course, you don't want to hear any of them in the first place except maybe Rick and Suss. And, by the time they come on, every radio and town is off the way. Well, the thing that was funny is yesterday, by camp, I just happened to turn on and like the lemon and clock. And, you know, I heard something about, you know, like, like, you just missed you just that. I was like, ah, ah, ah, ah. Well, don't tell me, pex and bought the thing back. I have no idea. But, um, Neil, I, what, you were just saying about being a programmer? I knew, met Rick Riley and, uh, I don't remember who the guy the program manager was, um, before they went. We only went first went to clear channel. Yeah, you mean, but, you know, me Peter Bullard. Yeah, they did. No, wait a minute. Harry Valentine? Yes. It was Harry Valentine. By the way, thank you again, Harry Valentine for having that moment. As dinner would be a Burton Jackson convincing me, even though you didn't intend to do it. That you're a complete asshole. A water-sabbo clone. And that's what convinced me not to sign the Pax and deal. And thank the Lord if there is one which I doubt. But thank goodness, any of that I, I, I, I, I, I did it with Harry penis. But I met them and I met them and, uh, that sweet tomato place that used to be across the way from, uh, I, I, I, I always knew deep in my mind that if I ever had a great experience in my life, it would be with a Harry penis. Well. If you, if you can't see it, it would be with you. If you can't see it, it would be with you. If you can't see it, it would be with you. But anyway, you're great. I always can see it. I just don't try to find it. Yeah. Well, not we get a chance to see if that thing works. That was great. You'll have that on the, we'll have that for promo sur promo excellent job. I think that was an inside job. That was probably a great calling from out of town as you see if the dump works. Anyway, it's 11. 20 on 5. 60, Q.

It was kind of like an obligatory thing on a change between the queer channel thing between I and Z and IOD. And they had a piece and Alice Rand tell was sitting there like a loan in his big room. Neil Rogers midday, 10 to 2. Hank Goldberg, afternoons now from 2 to 6. The new Chris and Boogie Knights, 6 to 10. And then it's game night with Ed Kaplan from 10 till the last game news. Have a great 98 from Sports Radio 560 QA and Neil Rogers got. That's why I bought some cardums today. You don't have to fight in. And careful not to bite in. Maybe all you have to do is just listen to what I say. You're not ready to eat that this clip you might need. I'll turn up my eat. Come all over me. You're a huge turn, you give me a sin. I went you wear that song. Come all over me. Stroke on my picker right. I'll rub your breast line. You got a nice rack. Got you down on your bed. Baby, come over me. Baby, come over me. See ya. Okay Bob and Cheryl, I'll tell you like I said things always look greener on the other side, but man, they were pretty damn good. You know what? Even Georgia smiling in. Not too bad. Anyway, it's 11 30 at 5 60 QAM and we're having a little picnic here. Wayne Arnold's silver food. Murray is here. Wings and things. Wings and curls. Rather brought us the, well I said, like I said, Wings and curls. Brought us wings and those poppers or whatever. The holiday colors things. You can't say, oh yeah, jalapeno popper peppers. And we got course pizza law. Let's mention him again 20 or 30 times. So you don't got a business. And it's just a big party here today. Two bad Greg ain't here to see it, right? Here's a tamarack. Hello. How are you doing, sir? It's great. Have you back, man. Mr. Thank you. And then can you play Ross to do? Okay, no problem in about six weeks. Okay, it's all requested Tuesday. And if you believe that anybody who thinks first of all, that we would play request on the first day. But of course this guy's only joking, but some of them are serious. Some of them are serious. What are you disshaveling in your posts? These are the drumats from uh, win-arms. Oh, we got drumats also, huh? And we got major rats. That's for the a jocks out here. Like I said before, why don't you people lighten up a little bit with it? I mean, one dimensional market, one dimensional marino. I mean, even my good friend, Rimmer, who's a great guy. I always wife's a lot nicer. But even Rimmer, that day that he was on for a hang on a marino. Good guy. As he all done, as he washed up, I think it's terrible. Let's keep him for another 20 years. Who cares? You know what I'm saying? They haven't developed another quarterback. Anyway, Craig Erris and couldn't quarterback a little, a midget, little league team. And they haven't developed another quarterback to replace this guy. Like he's going to be there forever. And you guys can hawk a chanick from now until the year 2050 is Danny Dunn. Is he great? I mean, forget it already enough. Narotic repetition. Narotic. Here's plantation. Hello. Hey, New God. Yes, sir. How you doing? Hey, man. What makes you such a hockey expert? What do you mean what makes me such an expert? Yeah, you come on. You say that you're hockey expert. Because I've been a hockey fan for 40 years. You're in most of the people down here. Don't know how hockey from a lender's bagel. Just because you know the difference between the length of the stick and the width of the pot. It doesn't make you a hockey expert. Yes, are you an expert? I'm nope. Nope. I'm just wondering what makes you so much for sharing your knowledge about hockey with a server. See at the game tonight. Not see one thing about our crowd is one thing they know and thank goodness not on my side. Not on the side. We're, I said on the other side, it's hey, ref you suck. You know one of our guys trips another guy flagrly sticks out his stick or maybe Spears him in the gut with a stick and a referee and off goes to the arm. Here's the penalty. Hey, ref you suck. It's a great to have that knowledgeable crowd out there at the arena, but at least we show up. We may not stay as long as we use to which really pissed off Wayne But in fact, how did it take me an hour and a half to mention about my friend Doug McLean and in the beginning I thought well You know, I was out of the country. I read it in the papers. I was shocked that it happened so soon But I did predict to everyone who would listen that he would never last the season because Doug he was like crumbling from the pressure He was getting psychotic with the officials the referees wouldn't even talk to him anymore And it just seemed that the team wouldn't play for him anymore for whatever the reason That's what I thought but then his time has gone on after the initial Brian Murray game You know, they'd be Boston 10 to 5 which I couldn't believe and After that and things have been really a rocky road until he's last two road games They still can't win it home so the verdict is still out but to me Doug McLean was the scapegoat and part of this whole Wayne business This is a matter of fact. Is that in here by the way George? Oh, please don't tell me it's not in here yet. Oh, geez It's not in there yet. So like I said, we'll play it tomorrow. Okay. Let's do my Emmy. Hello Leo God.

Okay 5 670 560. I'm real disturbed about that line three You know me you know me. I just look at it and it's sitting there and it's just the kind of an annoying little irritant like a like a mild hemorrhode Speaking of that by the way I want to tell you about the biggest scam or at least one of the biggest scams going anywhere and that is magnets Magnets now I don't want to go into a big long thing about this, but I might anyway I have been in incredible pain on my foot. Thank God. Maybe it's psychological. Maybe it's a Greg Reed pain but the last two months in the heel of my foot They took X-rays. There's nothing in there. It might be a tiny bones for baloney. I went. I went listen to this Hemorrhides okay, cuz you're traveling all over the world. You're eating bad diet and you know you're irritating a lot of candy I scream and crap and I didn't even the right foods. Possible very weird tomato sauce irritating Bad hemorrhides real bad, okay? A real pan in the ass. I go to my proctologist Which I will not mention their names on the air for obvious reasons because they're sitting monitoring right now but anyway Check everything out you got piles, okay. Thank you so much. Just to after he looks deep inside my friend I got piles. Thank you. That's a bulletin then he sits me down in his orifice and he's peddling me on oh the greatest thing magnets Magnets magnetic in-soles for my feet, okay? $65 he pedals made for magnets which everybody oh Dan marino's wearing him on his back look what it's doing for him hot nice going Danny and race horses. They're putting blankets on race horses with magnets for their backs for their days for their ass So I buy these in-soles for my shoes. We go out to Vegas. I'm out there three or four days walking around running around losing my ass and my foot is starting to kill me from these goddamn magnets in my shoes I Take the magnets out because now at least I can walk a little bit and as the days progressed I realized I've got a serious problem in the hill of my foot that hurts like a mother Which only in Alaska play two months of agony because of these freaking magnets so let me just alert all of you out there You know first it's you know the the pill that's gonna make it how's the land energy doing by the way?

Oh well, it's so you know everything is a pyramid Exxon is a pyramid the whole world is a pyramid, but it's great for you got to learn up on it I learned up on it all right my foot is killing me already. Okay? You know, I think that my proctologist will look into branch out in other areas so to speak because if you ever wondered What kind of a practice? What kind of a young man who goes to medical school? chooses proctology to be his profession to be his area of endeavor so to speak as in rectum. You know, I mean what is that? What kind of person wants to look inside other people's rectum all day? I mean let's get serious okay doc so it's no wonder he's looking to branch out a little bit get off my ass doc It's 12 25 magnets.

And I'm here to tell you that with the new packed and management in place, we feel we no longer need a talent such as Neil Rogers. But we do have some very exciting changes in store for you here at Wild that we believe will emulate the enormous success of our Orlando station. And John, John, you can stop rubbing my legs now. Okay. Yes. You did a fine job down there. Oh, there's no doubt about it in my mind. In fact, you know what I think I'll do? Oh, I think I'll make you the creative services director. How's that sound? Wow, great. Hey, how about those old jingles? Pretty funny stuff, huh? Yes, yes, very funny. And you know what, John? And a couple of hours you'll have a year's worth of production done. Oh, well, looks like I'm going to hit the garage for another smoke. I just go, man, they don't make him anymore like that. Harry penis, I'll tell you that. I want to wear a hell of you wound up. I wonder what AA meeting he's at this week, huh? Boy, boy, do they know how to pick him at Paxon that John M and Wilder's Sabo? And Harry Valentine all cut out of the same cookie cutter.

I could set you like a $4 car machine for 600 bucks. Yeah, that is an adornado. No, be yeah. Well, I didn't take it personally, Roby. Well, I guess we won't make any difference now. Why we sure probably want a bucket of crap there, didn't we? Alright, Roby. Bring him back. They're going to put him on the stupid talk network by the way. Most of their hosts are dead anyway. Here's the show, Shurar. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Welcome back, Neil. Thank you. And it's been hell without you. You're right. Oh, man. Shurar is hell for me, man. Have a nice time for seven months. Take a nice big fat paycheck every week. Oh, yeah. Super tall. I'll be looking at a big fat one every week. That's an oxymoron. Yep. Well, just to call. Welcome back, Neil. Great show. Thank you. Okay. Short and sweet. 5.6.7. Oh, look, I like Ray Whitney. Short and sweet. 5.6.7. 0.5.6.5. Boy, I can't wait for that game tonight, man. That San Jose game. What a grudge. Max. The Panthers are going to kick their ass or else tonight. No more excuses, man. And that Fitsy who rhymes with something else that starts with an S at an H. Fitsy, bad attitude. Looks like he's on a way out. None too soon. Here's a mobile and haven't sure. Hello. Neil, I've been on home for seven months. So good to hear you. How about that latrine's free well, by the way. We forgot to talk about that. What a guy. Yeah. I just want to welcome you back. I can do digs. I'm going to have a break. I want to grab that on Greg Reed. If he ever shows up in town again. Yes, sir. And you got a nice place there. A nice board. Fine. All great stuff. You're different. Except for the old, uh, measly discards. Everything else is great. There you go. Welcome back and it's good to hear you voice. Neil and Whitney. God. Thank you. Excellent company to be in. By the way, Ray Whitney is in Gades. I was asking Remor about that last night. His Ray Whitney married yet. And he said he's engaged in any minute. But it's not too late. Here's his. Here's my me spring. Hello. My me springs. Going once. Going twice. I know they're on there. But, uh, you know, we got a little bit of a quality on the phone thing. We got one line. Not working. They can't hear us. I can't hear them. But hey, it's only a radio show. Who cares. Let's take the money. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi. Yes, man. Betty. And welcome you back. Hi, Betty. I had a phone. We have a rider who's sitting on the beach listening to you. He couldn't wait for you to get. Hey, Roger. You're a new one, Roger. You may be. He's been to low to you all the time. At the pants. There's not. This is not. Oh, God. He's not the one that's Brian Scrootland's former neighbor. No. Oh, thank God. By the way, that guy is listening. Brian Scrootland's former neighbor. I get the same message. You don't have to come and say hi to me before the game tonight and tell me the same thing. And about your wife is sitting over there. Wave to your wife. And she's scared to me. Nice seeing you go away. You know, when he said to you, he came up to you when I said, uh, kneel. There's X amount of days until you're back on the air. He was one of the first ones that said it to you. Excellent. At least you got a boyfriend who can count. That's a good. Okay, so we thank thank you. Thank you so much. There she goes. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I forgot to give our facts number out. Thank God because that saved us a lot of money on that paper. But our facts number, we do have our own facts line, which is a major, major accomplishment. Here, thank God, the beastly is don't know about that yet. It's, uh, oh, you know what else I have forgotten about? Bill. We're on in the Fort Myers now, right? On the, um, on that margin we think so. We're on a station over there that is so marginal that even if we were on the air, even the beastly people don't know for on here. That's how it might be that old WWC and member George, 770 that we ran for about five minutes. That was a boy Gary idea back in a good old days. I think we got three calls from over there from the people under the age of 100, who weren't, uh, who weren't parking their account. But at any rate, we might be on WWCN or some station in Fort Myers, which I don't think they can call us on these lines, but wouldn't that be an exciting, a momentous thing? But our facts number is 305 area code 650198 305650198. So if you want to set us a facts and, uh, I got one from Brian Andrews, she's floating around over there at Channel 7 and says, hey, Neil, great to you back on here. We show all the best you're friend in theplex, Ryan Andrew. Myth going nice here and for me Brian, good guy. Little strange, but aren't we all? Okay, that's why we're in broadcasting. Here's, uh, Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil, yes sir. Hello. How you doing? How you doing, buddy? Great. I just got to have you back, man. Get, uh, got tired of listening to Zeta. I don't blame you. Yep. Um, one more thing, um, I need to hear a boundless man. Otherwise, uh, something else might happen, and still a capability. Uh-huh. I might just, I might just do it, you know? I just want to make a good road. I'm going right now. Got no water. Okay. Thanks a million, pal. See ya. Okay. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5. So let me ask you Neil, are you really still, uh, yeah. Okay. Let's go to a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Oh, my goodness. I've been judging for you for seven months now. Here you go. Oh, I'm just going to show you that the best things in life are worth waiting for. I'm just having a great time. Like, great Whitney. I took my, uh, little portable radio into the Dr. Gopped. Take my son to the doctor and he always hates that because I sit there and snicker and chuckle and nobody knows what I'm laughing at. Uh-huh. Great. Get him all ready, yo. You doctor's not a proctologist, is he? No. This was a back specialist. My kid has a rupture, d�. He plays hockey. Really? Yes, he does. Great. Get those kids out there. Hey, listen, last, uh, you, uh, you, by the time you, you know, every time you get transported to the hospital across from a pine bison arena, they know him by name. They're going to put a new wing on that hospital. It's about two blocks from the ice arena. In fact, we might have to sign him up all the petting and how things go. If we don't want to look up, if we don't want to look up, if we don't want to home game pretty soon, the panthers may have to sign him up. He's ready. I can have them suited up in an hour. Okay. Number nine. I already got his uniform number nine. What is your seat number at the arena? I'm in a section 106 in rural R. It's a seven. We've got to have gone and, you know, we've sat there and everybody else is looking at the game. I'm looking at the stands trying to find you. Well, they're right. I'm so glad you're back. You know, I'll be there tonight. I'll be there bright and early. Oh, cab a great game. Well, thank you. We'll see you tonight. Bye. Bye. Yeah, I'll be there in Denise Pothand's breathing a big sigh. I really haven't ripped him and asked too much today. Yet. And of course, some of the other people. I mean, you know, I don't have a personal problem with Denise. There are other people who do, but, you know, I can't. I can't find other people's battles for them. I'm sure. There are other people that want to develop a small pair. Be my guest. Go ahead. Have a great life. Do your thing. But don't expect me to start coming on the air and talking about Denise Pothand and talking about the fact that he contributes nothing to the broadcast. As nothing to say is a dumb frog far beyond for me to say those things because Denise is my buddy to my face. And, uh, never the twain shall me. What do you want from a frog? Anyway. It's 109. 109 already? God. It seems like we've only been here for 15 20 hours. You know, I'll tell you these first shows or anniversary shows any of these like special events, which thank God don't have it in this time much. But these things are draining especially after seven months of a life of luxury. Get up in the morning whenever you feel like it until your dog wants to start peeing on the floor that you know it's time to get up. But I mean, this is the way to go. This is a preview of retirement. The only thing is lurking in the back of your mind at all times knowing that you have to come back to work at a certain place. It's, uh, there's a little something missing there. But once you got a few bucks dashed away, you know, I mean, these people say, wow, you know, I don't know about this retirement. I'd be bored to death. Get a life. Get a clue man. They'd be bored to death. Like Dick Clark and that other Dick Edmick Manor running around ringing people's goddamn doorbells. What is the story with them already? Get a life. The two of them have got enough money to buy Ed enough boost to last a year. And I've got to get a hundred. And Dick Clark to get a facelift. By the way, looking pretty old. Thank God. We like you, Dick. But thank God he started age rapidly. He's making up for about those 30 years when he looked the same. When Steve Kane surgery was working good on his push. Given the Steve's number, William. 10 after one on 560 QAN. Are you feeling lucky? Hollywood's seminal gaming opened in 1979.

That's right, look for goodbye FDR. And I can't even limit the Kremlin. A tribute to Joseph Stalin. Elton John's tribute album, their droppy-like flies on sale now. Okay, good time to give lots of credit to the FBI to my mev's police for a great job on a Klanan in business over there with Gianni Versace man. Great job really alerted the community. They knew he was in town for like weeks and weeks before the murder. And while they were handing out flyers in the Fag bar so they said bull crap baby. They dropped the ball. How come this guy was one of the 10 most wanted on the FBI list? Why was his picture not on the front page of the Harold? The Diario, Delas, whatever that Fag Spanish paper is. And the Sun Sentinel. Nobody knew he was here except the FBI and the police. And then of course you notice like three or four days ago they did this thing where they changed the way they on the pawn shops and they had to change the way they do that. And they actually have a computer. They must, they might be a police must be run by the measly people. Because they just don't believe money in spending money for equipment. No, we don't want to have no computers. And here it takes us a few weeks and then of course maybe the guy got out of the town. He gives them his signs, his real name. Here's El Paso Porto. Here's the whole thing. This is who I am. Come take me away. We haven't got around the video because we haven't takes us days to get to that pile of crap over there. Besides, he was only killing Fag. That's true. That's a good point. He was only killing Fag except that guy Lee Miglid and Chicago. He was no Fag. We don't think. But they, you know, and they cared the guy the undertaker there and the jersey. He was no Fag. So I mean, you know, we don't think but you never know. You know what those undertakers do out there and those dark cemeteries laid at night. You know what I'm saying? Correct, I'm exactly. So watch out for them. Look at what Crossey moto did. Anyway, it's 115 and it's better not look at what Crossey moto did. Welcome back, Neil from Juliet. Chronic Juliet. Mr. You can't call him on the swish board at work. Thank you, Juliet. That's for you. Fag is ought to be pouring in. Aren't they pouring in? Pouring? They are way out. They're dribbling. They're kind of like me. They're dribbling in 305. 650. Oh, 190. I shouldn't give an app to the beginning of the show. We could have wasted a lot of paper and spent lots and lots of their money, which I'm going to be doing. Here's one from Barbara Cabrera. Oh, Barbara Cabrera. You know, Barbara from La Prenza. I'll really, really. I'll really appreciate it. Wishing you the best and you newest and never to kill him. Thank God you are back. The Osmio, she says, have missed you in Jorge like hell. Love you. Thank you. Barbara, we love you. Sweetheart. God, do we love her? Here they come. Here's, uh, yeah, this is from Barbara. La Prenza. She's got the, uh, Horus scopes. Let's see. What does it do for, uh, scor, scorpios, not unless. So I guess I don't count. Thanks a lot, Barbara. Like I said, I take it back. Here's Miami. Hello. Oh, yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. You know, I sell magnets in the problem with the, uh, heal. They gave you the wrong magnets. Now, I have a set here. It's in the positive way to do. And it's reusable if to bowel movements. Yeah, I'd like to take your order. It's reusable one after it's in the positive story form. Uh, you use it. It's reusable after bowel movements. Yeah. I'd like to take your order. Okay. How many did I'll give you my proctologist address. You said him right over. Uh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Here's scorpio. It's as the worst of the lot. You are shrewd and business and cannot be trusted. You shall achieve the pinnacle of success because of your total lack of ethics. You are perfect son of a bitch. Oh, I see this is all comedy thing from Barbara. I thought this was like a real low horrendous like a terminal. It is kind of terminal Barbara. We'd love you anyway. Here's uh, how come no one is flashing on here? Oh, I see. It's a lady in Key West. Hello. Lady in Key West. Hi there. How are you being doing? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, Neil. How's that? Everyone. Good. I'm so happy. It's heavy back. Even with a bag like me, it works, huh? Oh, easy. All the holiday foods you know. Yeah. I just can't help it. That was a better way. Pardon me. I have a question for you. Yes. I heard this nasty rumor that all that money that Elton John made. Did not go where was supposed to. Absolutely correct. I mean, I thought the kids had enough money. And that's a wrong cut. Sorry about that. I'm glad you died below that. That's what Elton said. Yeah. Well, I really need to go now. Okay. Yeah. I really need to go down to my spot. Don't just go on. You're buying those rose. Me, whoever. You're holding our hearts. You were the greatest place. Oh, we're lives. We're torn apart. You called that, isn't it? You called out to our country. Oh, roar. And you whispered to those who made it now. You belong to him. Oh, my God. And the stars fill out your name. Yeah. And it seems to me, you live your life. Like a candle in the wind. Okay. Never played with the sunset when the rain city. Are you sure? And your footsteps will always fall here. A longing and green as here. You've heard your candles burned out long before. Oh, oh. You're living in the wind. I don't know if you do know what her last words were. I don't know if you do know what her last words were. Okay. It's 118. By the way, that was all a bunch of baloney. There were no last words. That was all made up. They had, I guess it was zero whack. You know, they got it. One of the things we talked shows. Who was in the Kennedy thing. From Dallas, Robert Helis from. But anyway, he said that as soon as the heart separates from the chess cavity, you'll be dead. There are no final words. There's no like emoting and no instructions. She was dead. Once they had the record or heart was, but we don't want to spoil it for you. Because after all, ferry princess, ferry tacos, it all works out together. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, it's great to have talk radio back on here. Thank God. God, that's alive. And that's it. You're trying to force feed stupid ass topics down to the throats of the public. When, you know, when the day or not is Auburn going to win the game against the high next week. God, I was a little worried about you when Fernando was on the list. If that made it, he would be on his list. Who? Fernando. He was on the small potatoes. He's after the big guys. Oh, well, it's good to, you know, he didn't hit you. And great to have you back on the air. You know, it was too old for me anyway. After you left, it's just, it was nothing but news, news. I mean, William Robert, Wilhelm Robert, Wilford of third, third time in the future. And just great to have you back. Thanks a lot. So yeah, you know, you know why Koonan and this is a story that you're only here on this show. Do you know why Koonan and Blue is brain's out? Because you got turned down by Jack Campbell, okay? Anybody that's, no, seriously, getting that old and ugly and I mean, not all that old, but that's out of shape that gets turned out by Jack Campbell. Immediate suicide. No question. That was it. Here's the fact this is land to have you back. If you wanted to know, I wanted to know if I could sue Joe Rose for calling me a Mexican idiot. Sure. I wasn't going to do it, but he stuck his, he stuck his, his, uh, up my dogs, Rectom. Okay, what should I do? Ah, you Mexican's are all the same. Okay, always bitching, complaining, looking for more welfare. Okay, let's take a call from homestead. Hello homestead. Got it. I was so excited. We had a call from homestead there long gone. Forget about them. Here's a Hollywood. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. Let's see if seven months of being off the air. If you affected your recognizing voices at all. You know who this is? Who this is? Yeah, wouldn't be the same show unless one of your chronic squalned in, right? Yeah, I've recognized the voice, but I, you know, This is, don't be the Kirby man. The real stubby? The real life stubby. Oh, my God. Oh, you're glad. Wow. Being so good to have you back. Talk about ponderous radio, man. Don't be sure. I've been off the air for seven months and I'm in such a good mood. I don't even mind hearing from you, Stumpy. Don't you? I'm surprised you haven't hung up on me yet. Fine. You're not even near it in the blanket. I do like that. It's so great to hear your man. It's so good to have the new year coming in with Uncle Neil on the radio again. So I think we can all agree on one thing that Marvelle brought. I mean, everybody's kinky. Everybody's got their thing. And not all of us guys dressed up in panties, even the fact it's. But if you just would not have come on a year and lied so much, well, I did it, but I didn't do it. And you know, Marvelle get a new wig and get out of our face already. Everybody now hates Marvelle, but like poison. Well, and at kiddo is that Kenny Albert with a moon with a moon head. He's got one eye in his forehead and the other one where his left iris supposed to be. I mean, get that kid off of there. Maybe he came in O.J. You guys are the Chris Moore School of Broadcasting. Could have called a game if you stuck an O.J. deep inside his back. I mean, forget it. Marvin O.J. will get back together and then be feel higher and back. There you go. Wouldn't surprise me get an 90. She's easy. All right. Don't forget. I don't tell her. I just wanted to see if you hang up on me and I feel like a hockey game. But I'm almost, I'm almost ready to say it's great hearing from you, but I don't want to be a liar in the first day. I was like, when that piece of crap can more conks out on you, give me, give me a call. We get a real vacuum. Ken Moore. Yeah, you, I remember you said you bought a new Ken Moore for your clean and lady. Yeah, boy, you went up the air on I. But you ought to see what she's doing with it. She's talking to me. Okay, see you. And out of your stuff, try to pedal crap. They come on here. It's not fed enough that the chronic syring. They're going to find that the interpedaling crap. They got magnets. They got the vacuums. Who knows what they're doing with those. Rectom. Vacuum hoses. Got only knows. And even he's afraid to look. But once in a while, does take a peek. I understand. Here's homestead. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I just wanted to say now you're back in the radio. Why don't you use it as a public forum to discuss issues like gun control and a Porsche. Right. That's right. Let me do that. I'm going to be doing this. You're going to be doing this. It's very important because there's so much community environment that needs to be reached here throughout the whole country. It changes the whole world here on a radio. Right. Okay. It starts tomorrow, pal. 940, 1290, 1417, 2595, come three. I mean, let's get serious. Okay. Crap that went out with knickers with high button shoes with guys where and the stripe tops at the beach. Okay. That's how old the stuff is that they're doing on this stupid talk network. The queer channel people destroying tool butchering two one-sgrade radio stations with a single wipe of their hand on even Mr. Whipple never wiped like their wipe in it. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Steve, this is, do you know what the peanutland plant doctor's not like? No. Yes, sir. It's no good. Have a good time. I call. I just think, just think, just think, just think, just think, just tell me what your problem is. I got a lot of problems, but not your back. You know, we all think a lot about them. I'll tell you, you've been, you've been sorely missed. I tell you, I called suds yesterday. I said, suds, I hope you guys have good lawyers at that station. We're not only drove up the road in a coma in the morning program. He started cracking up. Yeah. And I just, I told so sorry for that guy. I feel sorry for suds. I even feel sorry for Rick. I mean, I know it's hard for me to say that because most of the people have worked with Rick Hated and Mike Poison. I wasn't what I'm George Hated him badly, deeply, seriously. I never worked. I was one of the people I was. I haven't been feeling feelings about Rick. No, Rick never seemed like a bad guy. He's not a bad guy. He's just a redneck. If he would admit to be in a redneck for more in county, it would be fine. We'd have no problem, but he didn't deny. We don't have anything to do. We don't have anything to do with kids before the next two, many more years roll by with his, you know, with all those dirt bikes and all that other redneck crap. But he means well. Well, you know, I did hold, you know, buddy for B.C. and against some slimy. But you know, everywhere's a ton of tools to stay. You know, we have where I guess, you know, we're back out. We looked in a little closer, right? By the way, ease up, Adam, okay. So we stole one. We had to only piece a material. I Rick Haden, like seven years and we stole it. Okay, there pissed off. Hey, maybe you can make it over there. Here is good for you. I like Chinese. I'm sorry. Maybe you get up at afternoon, try factor with Rick, suds and hang. We love suds. Yeah. Hang in suds. Maybe suds can just put a cat over there. Got a good ring to it. Hank, right. I got to talk to you later. Somebody's coming up to my car. Okay. Watch out. Roll it into up. Open line at 560, 560, 560, 560, 560, Hank, and suds. Got kind of a nice sound to it, huh? For Rick. Rick takes things. He, that's a problem. He takes things to hearty. He takes him so seriously. It's just business. Rick, it's most definitely personal. Here's a Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Welcome to hell. Welcome back. Thank you. Can you hit the nail on the head with Linda energy and Dr. Who? You must have been last in life and last one. No, it was a physician. A physician. Dr. Who? Yeah. And Dr. Who? And then I was probably with so weak doubt. She's sending us clippings of how fan fan was killing people. And about all this stuff that was going out with the lawsuits. And it was like a big joke to her. You must be physical. You started people at happened. Yeah. Well, I couldn't wait for you to come back to get on her case. In fact, I think that's what the Harold meant when they said no Moss. I think it was the fan fan article. And they put in the Jorge Mosque, no, the article by mistake. That's what we're talking about. Little bit of a typo. But you got, let me, I want you to think about this. It was the week before Christmas, OK? Yeah. Now, let's say you're an advertiser. And you put a big multi-thousand dollar ad in traffic magazine to peddle your crap for Christmas, right? Yeah. And the Harold cancels the goddamn magazine because they're so afraid that no Moss is going to offend a few old Cuban planned dominoes in domino park who don't buy your stuff anyway, who knows picketing ways. You got to be foaming at them off. I see a lot of lawsuits to the Harold. Another revolution in Miami. I can see a lot of people canceling that Harold immediately. Welcome back, Uncle Mio. OK, thanks. See ya. We don't want to start another campaign with people canceling the Harold, do we? We do. OK, 127 on 560 QAM.

Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes sir. Hey, how you doing? Great. Welcome back. Feels like only 20-30 hours ago we started this show right? Yeah. It's been a workout. Making up for seven months in one day. Listen, I had a question a little surprised is the bird contract still under negotiation or what? Oh yeah. No, we brought him back but he's sitting outside eating the food. We did this part of the meal. We didn't put him on here. We're just letting him eat the food. Anyway, look, you sound great. Welcome back and I'm be tuning in. Okay. Later. See ya. Thanks. 5-6-7-05-60. Actually this has gone by pretty fast. We had a lot of pinnanyS people hanging around here earlier today. Most of them have moved out and it's a piece of cake now but man, early in the show, frantic. Frantic, so I caught it. That John Dutzman, man. John Ducebag needs therapy. He needs to be locked in a member in Clockwork Orange when they locked him in a room and they had the Beethoven blasting. That's what they needed to do with John Ducebag from Channel 4. Lock him in a room with Neil Rogers tapes just blaring and blasting if there's any chance to cure him of his Neil hysteria. Man is obsessed. He's got Neil Rogers disease. It is terminal. Here's kind of like the shows on the stupid talk that worked terminal. Here's Voka. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, it's great to have you back. I cannot believe the quality of this call. Why? Are you like on a real phone? Yeah. You're the first guy I've been able to hear all day. I've got to show for three and a half hours. I've got to take my way through. I can't hear a goddamn thing. And you sound like you're right next door and you're in Boka. Well, I'm the first caller then. There you go. I just. Right in your diarrhea. I just can't believe. I mean, I wanted to talk you back and when Diana died and I couldn't get it. You weren't there. I guess I agree with you. What was the big deal? What is the big simist with her? I mean, did anybody give a flying crap about her before she died? Well, I don't know. I mean, the British we understand because they're so desperate for anybody who might have the slightest touch of humanity, which I guess she did, we can understand that. But all around the rest of the world who can, and no matter where I was, Amsterdam, Rome, Berlin, no matter where I was, you turn on the TV and every local channel. They're hockin' a Chinatonic in Dutch and in German. And Italian about I beat by the bull, but Diana, Diana, the NHK, the Japanese, and all those little gooks. They're bop bop bop bop. I mean, what is that? What the hell did she ever do? I mean, she never stole a freight train, but what was the big story with her? I meant to be honest with you, and I know people might disagree because they've got this thing they've been brainwashed. She wasn't all out of attractive. No, she was. You can walk into the Saudras mall, of course you got to look at their green cards and see where they're from. But you walk in the Saudras and see a thousand women look better than she is on any given Tuesday. Right, she had a big, the birds landed on, but it, right. But I don't get a hunker, like very man-alone man, I should play that damn thing. I'm a, you know, if you're a billionaire, I'm glad you're giving away some money. You should give away money to people. And not only that put all of this charity stuff, it was all arranged. Then in a whole royal family, I'm not saying she didn't do some good things, but nevertheless, it was all prearranged, it was all PR stuff. And in the meantime, she was spending money like it was coming out of a faucet. Right, and everybody's telling me about it, don't want you to kill a star for the kids in the winter, man. They're all in there. Everybody's kids out there should have a rough future like they're going to have man. I want to get these 15 years old. They're already saying that he's got figures. We hate his guts. We're not around off with what's your name at bitch and make him the king. I'm not too sure. I think maybe that'll make him the queen. I'm not too sure about him. He's a little too pretty to be the king. How many kids lose their mother and they're not, you know? Yeah. I mean, what happened to me today? Oh, I'm tired. And then of course, the same thing with this broad end-winged limb with the baby sitter, the old pair. Same thing. The media people decide, I mean, there are kids getting killed every goddamn day. And the media doesn't care for five minutes. And this story for whatever reason they decided this was the big deal. And they were going to, of course, then the guy would have been very direct head of getting involved in any of his stick. His nose. And then we got Johnny Cochran sticking his nose and latrine's free well out there in a West Coast. I mean, it's just unbelievable. The media has created all these assholes and we can't get rid of them. The old J thing is what done it. The old J thing is what really started this. It started the whole court TV thing. All these guys have got jobs. The guy that's on MSNBC, John, what is his name? The guy with the glasses from the West Coast. He's on there like constantly with the carrot collar here. John Gibson. He's on there because he was on the OJ thing. These two fakers, the 1230 on CNN, they're sitting there, they're doing their point counterpoint, the two lawyers, El Frieda von Norge, whatever in hell, their name is Eva Brown. And the other guy, Roger Cas, Roger Cas. Roger Casacre, whatever in hell is his name is. They got all of a sudden their stars because they were on with the OJ thing. Right, and everybody's got to have a career because of OJ. God, be given us a break already. That's right. Okay, okay. Okay, bye. This two show pass. Okay, oh the pass. You give me cool. You give me cool. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, okay, okay. You give me cool. You give me cool. I've been you two. I've been you two.

We would have to even back to where he came from to the hurricane. You know, maybe they would have scored a touchdown. Back to the Hurculans for Gary Steven. That's what I say. In the seven months you've been off the air. I got a sad story. I gained about 22 pounds. Yeah. And the main reason was because I lost the address. I can especially source slimy. Okay, just head east on Helen Dale Beach Boulevard to the water gets up to the steering wheel and call us back when you get there. Five six seven. Oh, five sixty. And that's that was one of the great moments to show you how stupid these old Farts are in his town. Sloimy's which doesn't exist. They were going for the Appkins Cheesecake. And I gave them an address that was like seven miles off the Atlantic coast into the middle of the ocean. And they were going there. And thank God for me because they probably wound up there. And never came back. Oh, man. I'll tell you if they could have an IQ test for an entire community. This place would be in a minus column. Hey, hey guys. Don't you think this would be a good trade? I'd bread headache it for the bees are. Yeah, right. Whatever you say, man. How about Tim Horton for the bees are now we're talking. Butch up that deep fence. At least he had a good haircut. Here's a mobile in the keys. Hello. And make a first child be a manly child. Ha ha ha. Okay, remember. Thank you, remember. Excellent call. Five, six, seven, oh five, six, the five, six, seven. See how I have these people program. I can't imagine how some of these people survived during the seven months. Because their entire lives are based around the crap that they hear on their show. The Godfather and the network and this and that. But I've been every once in a while. A little one of those. You know, I mean, their entire lives are. So thank God for me coming back. You welcome. Here's two bad Greg Reads out of town. It can be here to enjoy all the excitement. Here is Boca. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, I'm glad you back. Because I was listening to Boca and Chris Moore for the past. Come on. Bad Boca. And talk about. I mean Boca, okay. Who's Chris? I think right now. Chris Moore is the he thinks he's funnier and he's not funny. Yeah. It is imitation. I ask you what time is Chris? More on. But here's a meeting with you. Neil. I didn't turn on the radio more than six times. All summer and all during the fall. I can assure you. He's show was not one of those six times. Okay. Well, I'm just. But I do hear the rumors that you know the guys a little bit out of shape and while Neil's not speaking. I never liked the guy to begin with. He's a no-tality. Couldn't broadcast the hockey game of his life dependent on it. And every time he comes, slump it up those stairs at the arena because I get there early. I'm sitting in my seat and he you know, do this funny to my face. Right. Like people who put on an act of your face and pretend to be your friend and then go on a year and rip you. I mean, I got something to say to you. I'll say it to your face. I never took one step out of the way to say hello to Chris Moore. And I don't wish him any yellow and I wasn't out to try to destroy his career such as it is, whatever it is. But this guy is in La La Land. He fances and often like on major talent, which he is not. He should put all his concentration into learning how to call a hockey game. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, like even if he would just once described 30 seconds of the game, it would be no seriously. They would put it in a hockey hall of fame. Don't you, I would stand there proudly and say, for 30 seconds, this man actually called a hockey game. And you know what though, but about Chris Moore, Boog at least has something to say. And Chris Moore would kind of bring Boog down to his level, unfortunately. And Boog would get sucked into trying to do that. Exactly. What I was going to say, he's been more eyes. Exactly. All right, my brother. Have a great day. Yeah, it was funny because it wanted to be for one of the games. And this was a lot of an amount of ago. Boog's, you know, who I've only, you know, seen from a distance high, how you do and you got orange here. But other than that, he came up and started a conversation with me and defending Chris Moore and Bappa. And I'm saying to him, I don't really, in the, of course, the, this is, practice is going on the loud music and arena and I'm getting a horse. I'm screaming trying to have a conversation while all this is going on. Like I have to get into a debate with the Boog Shambi about what Chris Moore is a broadcaster like this kid knows a hockey broadcaster. Okay, give me a freaking break. Now, where the hell is the very important thing that we're just going to, all I know what it is. I know what it is because I want to get everybody in the mood for tonight again, because it is San Jose, the team from which our guy came and I have the wrong damn, this is going to thing. How do you like that, George? I'm so disorganized, it's terrifying. I'll find it. Okay, let's go to a lady in Pemberg Pines. Hello. Yeah, I'm so sorry, but we're just like in the bedroom. We'll have to stop like a baby girl. I just think you're just like the inside of my hair. We're going to be in you, baby. I'm going to say the baby, I can do anything I want to do. I can't do this, don't keep all that. And I'm going to be the same, don't keep that. I'm going to rap show. Yeah, what do you like? I'm going to rap show. I've got some hours to go to show. I'm going to rap show. I have a way to get your own show. I'm going to say it down on Hollywood. I'm going to stop like a baby girl. I'm going to show you the piece. I'm going to say it down baby. I can't do anything I want to do. I can't do this, don't keep all that. I can't make this, I can't do this. I'm going to blow you up. I'm going to blow you up. I'm going to blow you up.

Catch all the NFL post season action and Super Bowl 32. On the home of your Miami Dolphins, what radio 5 60 QAM. Welcome to the Clear Channel Collective. You have been assimilated, resistance is futile, and will result in your termination. We know what's best for radio, and you will be required to assist in the assimilation of all relevant radio stations. A relevant radio stations will become all news and left to die. Since talent is expensive, they will be transported to what we believe are relevant radio stations with smaller voltages and scattered in a network of confusion. And by the time they are rendered helpless, the collective will have already disposed of them for profit. Now, grab that frying band and repeat after us. We know what we're doing, we know what we're doing, we know what we're doing, but you. Alright, 157, and a good leap in everybody. On 5 60 QAM Hank. Hello? How you doing? Does this work? Is it, are we on? Then you hear me? Do you know that they were going to have a billboard campaign since you moved up to two and were on like back to back. They were going to have a billboard with you and me standing back to back and it couldn't find billboards. Bring it up for the two of us. Hey, did they run a billboard for anybody? Yeah, exactly. I've been here now for, uh, and here about five years have not had one promo outside the radio station. I'm going to club not a plaque, not a street sign with my name on it. Not a sandwich board. Nothing. sandwich board. That would be appropriate. Seriously, you guys are going to thank me in a long run because if you could see, well, I don't want you to see you. You'll be in tears, but I mean, this is a pretty good joy to over here. I'm just sitting here squatting flies. That toilet that festering sewer that you're working in over there, you will be out of there. Uh, hell of a lot of fun. In fact, you never would have been out of there. They tried to con me into a building a studio and a broom closet over there. I went up and out of the closet for 20 years through that. We were going to be adding here two years ago, April. Yeah. How's it coming over there? We fooled everybody. Things here are coming along. Thank God for George Corso. This man is the best engineer single-handedly. He did the work of five for the pay of like about one half. And if it weren't for him, we never would have got this thing on. How was your first day? Pretty good. Pretty panless. Yeah, everything worked. What's everything worked? We got the PINDS media people out of here. John Dooshbag, this guy's out of control. And things actually work over here. It's, um, it'll stop working soon. Oh yeah. Well, well, I have one question for you. Well, you see the cart deck over here. You'll know that those are words of wisdom. You're right. I have one question for you. How many vacation days did you get? Uh, 298. Plus Jewish holidays. I know. I know. I know. You know, people are saying, well, you demanded this. Look, if somebody promises you that they're going to do a bunch of things, you say, hey, no problem. I'll take it. I'll take the studio and then you hold their feet to the fire, which, of course, in this case, we never had to do. Because the guy is always out of town. How do you like this great act of courage on a part of our general manager? Greg Reed, everybody else is in the studio. The boss, he left town. He high-tailed it. Yeah, he's, uh, he has some things he's supposed to give me this week. He's not around. There you go. Typical. Couldn't be a coincidence. Could it? No. So how do you like moving up to the six? Um, I don't know yet. I haven't tried it. But I, I think it'll be okay. I, I miss that, uh, I missed across over with cramarty. Yeah. There you go. Now you, okay. Yeah. That was funny. All right. I always like when you used to say to him, hey, stupid. And he said yes. That was my favorite part of the show. I think that's history. Okay, Hank. We'll, uh, we'll be with you. This two to six will work, you know. I think since I have, uh, I have a, I have a lead in. Since you have a lead in and we have no, how does it feel now to have no competition? Not weak competition? No competition. Well, thank you, queer channel, for doing what nobody else could ever do. Well, actually, that started a few months ago. And, uh, not, uh, I'm not blown smoke at you, but, uh, when you went off the year, that, that was the end of that station. And nobody enjoyed it more tonight. It's sticking at the packs in and now our good friend David Ross. Yeah. And by the way, and I don't feel sorry for Rick Rally. But I do feel sorry for such. And I want you to be up front and honest. You don't feel sorry for that guy. Not at least. Not at all. See you, Hank. Hey, me, welcome. Thank you. So that dispels all those rumors. But I can't, we'll take a 30-sex issue. We have no format on this station. I just got to play this again in honor of tonight's big game with San Jose, the Panthers, 730 in Irina Don Cherry says.

Unbelievable. 13 golds. He's done with it. Nobody's talking about him. All spare that the two barns has gone that Ray would come in. Unbelievable. Guys, just a little guy worth a map.

He says to me is, so Neil Rogers really getting a million dollars from your area of station. First thing out of his mouth, good I hadn't seen him in a couple years. Don't be fristed.
