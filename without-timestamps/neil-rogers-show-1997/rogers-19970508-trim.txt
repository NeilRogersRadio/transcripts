How much could I have missed? I can't flip it over there In the 10 o'clock hour Just to watch a couple of minutes During breaks in a hockey game Right And every time I went over there They were still in the same break So finally between second and third period I saw 20 minutes worth And then I saw the last 15, huh?

No Okay I know you're too sweet You're too nice That's what they always said You're too nice So I guess Friday night see I got another dilemma now Oh, for sure Because first of all I got a tanning class And of course I can always tape it But I can't I can't tape off my big dish And have the hockey game on too It's one or the other You know about that I want me to tape it Oh, that would be nice Okay That would be great And you could leave it in my front door I sure could Without knocking on the door But you know me I take an episode for a hour But that would be very sweet Because I got this Edmonton collar ryanocere Turn into something Sure, well I'll do that and I'll drop it off over the weekend So we can talk Monday Great Okay Have a great weekend Bye bye There's the not sliding lady back Because we had not sliding back on CBS last night One of the great shows in the history of TV If I do say so myself Wither without Pat Peterson How do you like that So I saw a little bit of that last night But the Edmonton collar ryanocere How about that? The oilers when everybody counted them out And it's pretty unlikely they're going to make a comeback in a series But pretty nice for them to win a game And they're going to be the first to the flat The Os Saber is oh man That's the game that ESPN the Dush You got the Dush all right You got the vinegar without whatever goes with it On that awful man Oh man talk about coma and dozing I watched the first period of that Because that was before the other game started And then periodically during the breaks In action I would turn over and see if Buffalo was making any Any kind of a ripple any kind of a rumble Anything whatsoever I mean nothing And then you read the article in the paper this morning No had a big game for the flyers made Seventeen save or 15 saves 15 saves Woo 16 shots they had in the whole game That's like the old Roger Nielsen Panthers in the years gone by Pretty weak Pretty weak if you ask me those sabers Why is it that the sabers even in years when they play We'll do a regular regular season like this here And the playoffs they are in incredible choke team An incredible choke team They just barely squeaked by Ottawa And the first round and now looks like Down and out And the worst rate Oh boy what are we going to do about them But Edmonton like I said a real shocker man He played a hell of a game They've been playing great in the series They're young they're hung they're unsung heroes They don't have a lot of big names Jason Arnett Curtis Joseph in the net But other net it's a lot of journeymen out there A lot of young promising stars for the future Including Doug wait I'm sorry I shouldn't have said that We'll get Brian Murray upset Don't get back on that Jack again So anyway we got another video to give away Did you want to give away?

Countdown Oh 3 2 10 W-I-O-D Oh, Crab like Here are the springs of the fions in the bleachers ride It's the time of the year When the skit flies You watch this big ass swing in your mother grandma's In your morning loaded from a six pack Oh Oh, you're raised by a space ball You're raised by a space ball But there's a never so-so there's a matter of fact Oh I play better than you And play as hold up the thing The set-up Oh I have no life 1019 W-I-O-D Georgia is insisting that all these colors we have are just called a snore for the free uh silly uh space jam video i don't believe that for a second So anyway, well, as soon as we take care of that we'll get into this survey now this is very important stuff no fool and matter and you and I are going to lose out in fact those of us in the building who almost unanimously except for Rick Riley Think that this new news guy we got in the afternoon William Robert Millhouse Nixon the third that this guy is kind of the award winning from the head of the world Yes, the world winning journalist right broadcast We're in the minority because remember we took the thing weeks ago and that was like 50 50 And now he's just uh he's more popular than Jesus Moses my hampered and Michael Jackson put together how do you like that? I insist those were just a bunch of O-Junna. No way you're wrong they audience this audience these needleheads man they love him But as far as the other categories that remains to be seen that but I think we're gonna come out on the short end of this stick on that one To be able we don't have John M on this survey but he hasn't been here long enough to really hate here's the sunrise hello Neil yes sir are you doing great hey, I don't know if you heard about how we're going off on you today Howard Stern no, I did not he has been about 20 minutes pretty much ragging on you about what he said You're a rip off I guess his Melrose guy calls you the other day. Yeah, he called him this morning And they ended up getting let me let me say this to you, okay Okay, okay The thing that I found first of all when that guy called it was so obviously a set-up deal to begin with when I started finding out what he does new years But the the interest that the thing that I find pathetic is that here's a guy who just finished with a major motion picture Which granted was only big for one week and then faded but but nevertheless had money by the way and lost a lot of money But had a millions of dollars worth of publicity they ran spots in the Super Bowl for that movie to promote it He's had more promotion than got he had a gigantic spike in the ratings in this market and every other one because of all that promotion And he feels compelled to talk about me which let me ask you how how many of his listeners and all those markets he's on all across the country how many of them even know who the hell I am Great question. Yeah, but you know then he goes on that you he goes oh, it's that flag and Florida that uses his celebrity to get little boys and bedroom Oh, really that sounds actionable to me. You're laughing, but I'm serious. Yeah, it was real sad and real disappointing. Yeah, but that's Howard Howard's got a big don't you understand? I think it has to do with all the stories about that contract and all the alleged numbers in there how much I'm making There are some people who are so petty and so jealous if they're making a hundred million year Third jealous of anybody else is making 10,000 years. You see what I'm saying? Yeah, and so Howard that's always been Howard stick He'll never tell you anything good about anybody else on the ear anywhere whether it's I miss or anyone he's the only person who needs to be on ear And that's that's the one thing and Howard's the one big chicken is armor that's always bothered me is that his ego is bigger than his nose Yeah, yeah, let me ask you one other thing. I'm not to change the subject too much But a while back you played a tape on about Ron and Ron the original Ron's talking together Yeah, it was basically they're going away. Oh, hi, goodbye to each other. Yeah, you still have that or trade again Well, we got time it's pretty ponderous now, but I got it. Alright. I'll work on it. Alright. Thanks for the good news. Thank you. Okay. Oh my god talk about desperate It must be really boring and our last couple of days. We haven't said to world on fire, but to be talking about me to millions potentially of people I haven't got any ID who I am. That's really productive. Well, thanks for the publicity by the way, how are we? We have an open line of day at 6221 at Broward 767. Here's Davy. Hello. Davy. Yes, yes sir. Yes, I am. Good morning. When is Diaz? Hey, listen. Got a question for you. Yeah, that's just trying to give you a form at nish structure and whole thing I don't know if you're not trying to give me anything. They're not going to mess with this show. You supposed Steve came might be coming back to take your place. That's the popular rumor. Really. Yeah, we're just peeing in our pants about it. Yeah, he's pitching heavy duty for this gig. Yeah, I was thinking he will want to be back at a radio station again. Yeah, right. And he works with the peanut, right? Uh huh. Kind of mum on that. What would you be by that? Well, you're not really doing okay. He makes a few bucks. He's doing all right for being on the make believe radio station. All right. Awesome. Great. I'm really happy you're going to other stations. Now I never have to change the bow. Good for you. Thank you so much. Also, I want space down. Well, that's going to mean everybody else is going to vanish, but you got it. Okay, great. Hold on. That'll hear it all up. Pay in line five. They'll hear it at the pin of the S. Free loaders. I think you're wrong George. These people are on their free loading for that stupid tape. They are well, we'll find out. Here's a lady in North Miami Beach. Hello. Hi, I was holding for that tape. I knew you were. But you didn't hang up though. But I heard him. I could have hung up. I just want to tell you one thing. Yeah. Well, you said it. You said. Hi. My husband. My ex. Yeah. Hi. My ex husband used to listen to this station about 13 years ago. And I used to think he was off the wall. He was like, she's like, I'd alized you. I want you to know that I just started to listen to you about two weeks ago. And I want you to know that I think you're phenomenal. I am. Thank you. Thank you. We're so sorry. We don't have 100 copies of the tape. No problem. Have a great day. Bye. Bye. Bye. Okay. We have two open lines in date. Now all of a sudden. 6229463. 6222Wiod. Maybe Howard's got me confused with the fruity gourmet. So at any rate, our survey today is going to be like basically a thumbs up and thumbs down. Bob Lassard would be really, really proud of you heard about us doing this. But it's something that I've been commissioned to do. And I mean, you know, you got to do your duty to do your thing. And it might be kind of interesting too. To see if maybe it's just us, maybe we're bitter because we're on a way out. You're a jolly certainly very voluntarily and very happily. But maybe we're bitter. We have a John this view of all really good stuff that's going on in this joint. Is that possible? There you go. So it's like thumbs up or thumbs down or of course, maybe you don't have it depending because maybe you haven't heard some of the elements in this survey. There's like one, two, three, four, five categories listed on here. Ron and Ron is the first one. William Mammilford, Newhouse, Nixon Schwartz, the third. The new news guy is the second one. The broctanial show is the third one. Karen K, the unmensitable one is number four, the consultants girlfriend. And the new jingles and rejoins, the great John Ford productions, the old moldy stuff that's number five. So this five are easy categories there. And I'm sure we're going to get a phenomenal response from the audience who like to a stick there knows the stations business and calling up and telling me what you think doesn't count. Yeah, calling up and telling George is not going to get to job done. If you want to participate in this very important survey, which may help determine the future of the station if it has one. You're better talk to me, okay, or else. I don't want to start playing Boach boss, but that's the end of your right. Most of the people on those lines were there because of the tape. We got like two, four, five open lines now because they were there to free load for some silly stupid cartoon tape with the bugs bunny and Michael Jordan for their little pain in the S kid. Isn't that said? And just here when I thought after two desperate days when they really cared about me, isn't that pathetic, huh? Two open lines in Broward, 7679, 463, 1026 at WIOD. Let's tell you about Pomp and O Park. Let's see what's the day today? New, well, I'm glad you asked. It's the eighth. That means we got tons and tons of simultaneous action for it. It ate Pomp and O Park. Noon today, we got Daniel Highly. I want to clock, we got freehold raceway with harness racing and Jackie Lee. Tonight, Daniel Highly at 715 for the night time racing. Meadowlands at 730, Hazel Park at 730 with Kevin Wallace and all those goham. The meadows with a great day, polonate 730, Saio Doughdowns from Columbus, Ohio at 730 and who's your park from Indiana 8 o'clock? So you got all kinds of good stuff going on. You got your polka room opening at 530 and don't forget now that the summer meet is going on again. The International buffet is back on the fourth floor of the clubhouse 1495 for all you care to shove down your gut and cloning chef. I was fabulous dessert. So even though the fall meeting is over, the summer meet is on. We got Samuel casting. We got live racing Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday. Something great going on all the time at Papadoharnas, Powerline and Atlantic in Papadoh beat. 6th, WIOD. The topic today? Why don't we get fun calls? Play right there. Oh, hold that for 6th, 10. WIOD. Hey, and how it? How it's spam. So we just had a spy report that the same guy who just called me about two minutes ago to give us the song and a dance about Howard and that's by report called Howard and with a whole song and a dance but just reversed. Ripping me. So twisting it all around and whatever it was that he said, another Ojo on provocateur. How do you like that? Nice going. Thank you so much and go back to New York. Okay. Okay. Let's start our survey here. We got more important fish to fry here than we're in about Howard. He's doing okay. We've got to move. We lost millions of dollars. He's doing all right. Here's a bokeh. Hello. Hello, Uncle Nelson. Yes, sir. I am here to participate fully in the race. Right. The first one of the day, this could be the turning point. You can set the trend. Okay. Thumbs up or thumbs down. Ron and Ron. Down. Okay. And of course, you can make any comments that you like to briefly. They are the terminal and we can do better than that. The news guy, William, the new news guy. Hi, I like him. Okay. Tony George. Brook Daniels. I like her. Karen K. Down. And shouldn't be on the air. It's just wasting everybody's time including her own and how about the consultants. And I don't know. I don't know how she looks. He might not be wasting her his time. She's not too good either. And how about the jingles and the rejoins. Bad, down. I like what you had before. Okay. Thank you, sir. And wait. I wanted to say a few things. We'll right ahead. Take your time. Well, I just. You still there? Yeah. Okay. I just want to say that we'll all follow you when you go down there. I've never seen a radio station get decimated like this, but it's the way it goes. Okay. And anyway, Jerry, she's a goddess. Okay. Whatever you say, I believe you. See you. Okay. There we go. Okay. And I want to make very sure because I know that when we get through with this, like it noon or one or however long we do this here in five minutes, that people say, well, they're just because we always get this even from that idiot, the Ian or whatever it's a house name is yet. Puts, you know, with no life who is in mourning and we've got a real sour edit two thousands Kelvin walked out on them, but the same crap like my opinions about the hockey games. Well, they all call in just to say to agree with you just to suck up. And of course, there is some truth to that. We don't want that. We want your honest to God cross your heart, hope to croak and burn it, purgatory, or whatever it hell they're supposed to be burning for a long time if you don't tell us the truth. That's it. We can handle it. What's all the week here? And you notice I'm not on there and Rick and Sudson out on there because obviously where the only components of the station left from before the big sale from before this is this is strictly a packs and research thing. This is strictly to a determine the let's see October. It's like seven months now. And to find out just with the audience we got left of course, two open lines in the Palm Beach and out of town lines on a survey, that's pretty damn insulting to us not one triple eight four seven four nine four six three one eight eight eight four seven four Wild. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Mr. sir. That survey is easy. Thumbs up on the news guy and thumbs down everybody else. They do got that list. Yeah, but you know what you're going to do. Thumbs down on everybody. Everybody except for that news guy. No, not on you and Rick and Sudson. Well, I'm not talking. We're not on the survey. Everybody loves me and Rick and Sudson. But I called about hockey. Yes. Coach is corner last night. Yeah. The 10 overtime goals that would have been called back. Right. That's stupid rule. That was pretty good. Yeah, that was good. Now, what about, you know, I'm a big dish owner and I was watching a little bit about that ESPN 2. I was wondering what you think about that bottom line crap. You mean that the bottom of the screen when they squashed the screen. So it looks like you're watching. Exactly. I hated it. Is there any way we can get rid of that or is that something that's going to be there? That's going to be there forever. That's that. That's see. There's this big pissing contest going on between ESPN and Fox and headline news to try to see who gets the scores on their to fastest. What I can't believe is that we're getting more, we're getting more graphics on the other than the game. You know, you have to score. Exactly. And then, of course, you get some, they got some of the paid sponsor in the upper corner and they got the score scrolling in the bottom of the screen. And they got the game squeezed down to about an inch and a half. It's like letter box sports. You know, I mean, who the hell wants it? I hated it. I want to tell you the CBC has it over everybody though. And by the way, I talked to John Shannon yesterday. My good friend at the CBC who if I live long enough is sending me a mobile. He would tapes, but I told him I'm not holding my breath. And he said, don't worry. With the big dish on a CBC, it probably be 10 years before they digitize. I think all of us all said disappointed Panther fans out of jump on the Edmonton Bandwagon right now. I love a man. They're great. They're an exciting team to watch. She must request. Yes, sir. Fred Cuse, a calling a goal for the Bruins guy. Okay. Thanks a lot. See you. Okay. We have an open line in Broward, 7679, 4663767. We're going to find Fred Cusek with this mess that we got here. We used to have tons and tons. And then of course, that one disc. How are we ever going to recover from that? I guess that's just a lost stuff. How George? That this number 13 we spoke to the. And of course, we can't even do anything with the many discs now because it's all to Broughlin and our engineers are running around wearing when Wayne Arnold's come with a free food. I'll find Fred Cusek here somewhere. If it's the last thing I do and it might just be, I'll find a Fred Cusek goal. A great Fred Cusek. One of the all time greats retired after this last season. You're on a keeper. Scott by Heinz is wide. Philan's the out great. Trying to put it on that miss. That was taken by Heinz. Scott's score. He's got them for a two-to-one growing. Okay. Now one of the greatest calls. But it'll have to do for the moment. I'll find some more. We have an open line on the out of town. We're doing our survey now. So what did I tell you about the new news guy? They love him, George. They love William Millford award winning. Et cetera. They love him. Here's my M.E. Hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Great. I take the survey. Okay. Ron and Ron. No. Okay. He said no. William Robert Millford, Millhouse Nixon, the Jones Schwartz III. No. Don't like him. Broke Daniels. Okay. Okay. Karen K. No. And double no. Oh, double no. I can only put down one. Well, I might put no. And the new jingles and rejoins? No. Do you hate them? I hate them. Do you hate them like poison? I don't want to put words in anybody's mouth. Do you despise them to the point of wanting to blow somebody's brains out? It's like slamming your knee in the door. Okay. Thank you so much. Oh, Neil. Yes. Go on for the part two. The part when the center is in Michael office. My offer is this, Senator. Nothing. No, before them. He said when the center said that he knew about him trying to take over one of the casino. Right. Right. Michael, look at Tom, the way he did when he said that. Well, you're really nitpicking now. I mean, George even George has got a furrowed brow at this point. Because he looked at him as if how did he had a person in the norm I did, and he's your father from somebody there. Yeah. You know what I'm talking about? Well, I have to have to be watched that part. Yeah, that's that. I'm going to spend my whole weekend We're watching that part in analizing it for you. Yeah. But also, I'm sorry. Senator, you wanted to get in the end, though, did he? No, he did. But also the other night, I'm a white came home. And she told me about the Karen K. The thing that you talked about yesterday is getting to yourself. Yeah. And she was going off about how stupid that was for how the lady doesn't like anybody who was opinion-difors with her. She liked to cut them off and tell them that they're wrong. But whatever, it was just so funny that how the next day you come on there talking about the same thing. There you go. So, okay, Neil. Well, what do you think about that guy with at $9,000 engagement ring? It's just a joke. Have a great day, pal. All right. See ya. My client demands an apology, Senator. I didn't know no Godfather. Frankie Pentangely, man, one of the hidden stars. Only through this show, do you realize what a great character in the Godfather Frankie Pentangely was? Nobody else who talks Godfather probably hardly ever mentioned Frankie Pentangely, Frankie 5-ang angels. Great. He could probably play for the angels. That's how bad they are. But we do like those new uniforms. That's what Mark Hoffman said this morning. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'd like to participate in survey. Okay. Ron and Ron. No. News guy, William, the third. The worst. Really? Yep. Brooked Daniels. All right. He's good. Karen K. The new jingles and rejoins. He didn't work, then William Robert douchebag. That's saying a lot. And also before I go? Yes. Here he got. Okay. I'll write. Here's the guy that knows which side is up. Thank you. And John M says thank you too. What did John M say? He always says that. We have an open line in day. 6-2-2-9-4-6. Get him some scope by the way. If he's got to sit that close to him. Get him some scope. Something at rhymes with the like soap. He's all right. He's just, yeah. Sure he is. He's tight with a PD though. He's tight with this hairy penis guy. And that's what it's all about. If you're tight with a PD wherever you go. And by the way, the people over the other outfit down the dial, the one that I'm going to, it would be nice if you return some of the people's calls once and why I didn't understand. They have this fetish with not returning anybody's phone calls. It's like a little game that they played on there, which they seem like very nice people. They seem. But you know, return some of these people's calls once and why the prices right. It's free. Last time I checked. Even if you tell them, blow it out your ass. At least return somebody's phone call and stop being such enigma's. And so like, that seems to be their whole thing. They even enjoy that. Being like out of contact. Of course I shouldn't be upset. They only turn my phone calls either. So why, you know, at least they're consistent. Here's for a lot of day. Hello. Morning. Yes, sir. Are you doing great? You had mentioned this about you could only pick up the Edmonton Oilers game on the big dish. How come you can't pick it up on the smile dish? Because I, you know, ordered the playoff games. And it wasn't on last night. I know. Well, I've an outly Colorado. They're playoff games. Have all been. I believe. They're all on like over the over the year channels. In other words, not a cable channels. Right. And so the small dish doesn't have any contract with whoever that might be. In fact, they might even be on pay. I don't know how that's working. But they're definitely not on sports channel. Arizona or Colorado. Whatever the whole thing is. And so the small dish, direct TV can't get it. So it doesn't have the contract. Another with the NHL doesn't. I, I don't know, contract out to have a satellite feed. To all across the country. So Colorado can black out there. Signal to different parts of the country. Even though I've paid to see all the playoff games. What do you mean black it out? They're not blacking anything out. It's just on the local TV. There. It wasn't on their cable thing. Oh, that's right, too. Yeah. But what I don't understand is I know that during the Edmonton Dallas series, the same thing was true with Dallas. They showed several other games on the local channel instead of sports channel. Right. And so what they did was they put the CBC telecast on two different times on a small dish. And people loved it. It was great. And I have no idea why they didn't do that last night. I haven't seen a CBC broadcast. But by the way, you talk about it. I'd like to see it. Then you'd see a real game. You would have seen Don Cherry in the coaches corner thing last night. And he would have paid in your pants. He's great. Did you see that saved by Patrick Ruah when they was a penalty being called on Colorado. And the Colorado guy was deep in the attacking zone. And he cleared the puck. And the penalty was being called. And Patrick Ruah was going to the bench. But the. Yeah. And he was the net was empty. He was going to the bench. And he had an almost put it in their own net and he came diving back. And just got it. He was like somebody sliding in a third base. He went sliding across the crease and just got a stick on it knocked it away. How embarrassing that would have been. It was pretty interesting twice in that game. It happened with both teams. Edmonton almost put it in their own net on a delayed penalty. And the avalanche almost did the same thing on that one. Right. Exactly. How come management's not on that survey? He should be. Have a great day. Thanks. See ya. I'm going to play it about our management. And what's what's that business that Wayne is in? Waste management. By the way, nice going. Wayne. We got republic up to 28 in the quarter now. A hundred people aren't too happy within their soon. They don't want to buy an up all their hundred dealerships. They're pissed off. We have an open line on the out of town line. One triple eight four seven four nine four six three. You know what I say about investing in the stock market. It's like going to the track without the entertainment. Make no mistake about that. I mean, if you want to invest in the market. If you want your mutual funds. If you want your stocks. If you want to dittler round. If you want to gamble. That's what it is. It's called gambling. It's pseudo intellectual gambling for the people minded like me. I wish I had time. You know, to sit around and just play the market all day. Just get on the internet. Oh, by the way, John Shannon told me yesterday very interestingly within five years. Now, he may be full of crap. And usually he has, based on within five years. Don't even worry about big dismal. She said everything will be on the internet. You'll be watching your TV. And you'll be able to get whatever you want through the internet. It'll all be right there. Great quality picture. And I'm wondering to myself, well, that sounds great. But what about this DHTV thing? That's coming out. I guess they have to accommodate that. What do you mean by that? HD TV. I bought it. I call it. DH. Well, HD DH. Come on. HD TV. I'm sure the weather is coming. Which is spending by the way of fortune. The government is spending a fortune to subsidize the television stations. So they can change overall equipment. So by the year 2006, I think it is that everybody's got HD TV. Which means you'll, I heard Rick talking about this. You'll have to throw your TV sets out and go out and buy a new TV set. But 2006, nine years away, I mean, who cares? You know, who cares right now? So anyway, we got all kinds of great new technologies that's going to cost us a lot of money. But boy, it's you're going to be great. That's what I care. I would like to be able to watch whatever I want to watch. If I want to watch Rick Jenner, right through the Buffalo game last night. Instead of watching ESPN with that Dave Strader who I can't stand. I hate like poison. I want to see Rick Jenner Red. Even though it was a boring game, I mean, the first period I was going to watch because the other game didn't start to leave 30. I want to see Rick Jenner Red. La la la la la, Jenner Red. Whatever the hell this name is, that's what I want to see. And you can't do it or it's blocked out in your area because, yeah, because everything is a monopoly now. If I want to pay for it, if I'm willing to pay extra to see it, I still can't see it. Trust me what I tell you, that's going away the win. Because there's untold billions of dollars sitting in there. And they just have to finger out a way to do it so they can get their eyes slice of the pie. Everybody gets a piece. What I've always said, if everybody gets a piece, everybody's happy. So how about that old John Provocca Terracell from New York that's looking to start a big son. Oh, it was somebody from inside the company? Aha. We just traced the caller came from the conference room where they're having another corporate meeting and they're also listening to the survey we're doing. So give it to him good. 1045 at WIOD, Hey Marlins fans, they lost last night. By the way, three to two intending, what a heartbreaker. How would a shame? Sunshine Networks fifth season Marlins coverage continues tonight. The defending nationally champion Atlanta Braves are in town featuring Chipper Jones, Kenny Lofton and a staff of Saeyong winners. And they got of course, what's his name? They don't look too bad either. What the hell is his name? Orion Clesco. Thank you, Neil. Jim Leeland's Marlins are loaded this season with Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield, Moishi, Aloo and Jeff Kohnon. The road to the pentacos through Atlanta and the Marlins have their sights set on the Division leading Braves. Keep his straight face. Sunshine Network will showcase 14 Marlins games this month. So in May, if you're looking for Marlins, look to Sunshine. The same place you'll find, the Atlantic Division champion, Miami Heat, who had a rough night last night, Ed Popes as they choked. The National Champion Florida Gators and the Florida State Semitals watched the Marlins and the Braves tonight on Sunshine Network starting at 7 o'clock and see why Sunshine be the leader in Florida Sports coverage. 6.10 WIOD. The 50-50 Hicks of today's hit. My grandfather was a professional firefighter. He's a constantly say, if your house is on fire, won't you jump and out the wind on him? I'm like, I live on the third floor here. I mean, he on me at the point, I could even lay the match in times like in six square. And yesterday's favorites. There are a lot of talk stations that are successful without Neil Rogers. We've had to be one of those stations. The best variety in South Florida. 6.10 WIOD. 6.10 WIOD. I recall when a webjays son came to see my husband Carl Fisher and told him that radio was the coming thing in America. And that it seemed a likely thing to have for my image. Of course, Mr Fisher was always looking for something to publicise his Miami Beach. And so he took to the idea. And he said, all right, I'll build you an island and you can put a radio station there. And he said, let's see, I'll lay in the island for John Levi. We'll call it John's island. And he said, what do you want to call your radio station? And web said, well, I don't know. But I've always thought that Miami Beach was a wonderful island of dreams. And my husband said, that's funny. Rectown WIOD. Then it was this station was moved over to Miami. And I remember that it was the year of the Big Blue by 1926. And the wonderful, beautiful tower was blown off by the hurricane. But WIOD has been one of the landmarks of this entire area. And here we are, 71 years later, and it's blue and bigger than ever. 1051, a WIOD. This is Carl Jane Fisher. There brings a tear to our fly. I'll tell you that right now. So here's a facts from when in Miami. He says, I can't wait until you get to that other station. I don't want to say QM. Even with the GE Super Radio, it's almost impossible to get to your station without a high pitch wine. Too much wine, going on on this diet. Totally, there's a lot of wine in Go and I didn't believe me. Did you? They're all wine in over here. He says, WQM comes in like an FM. This is the crap out everybody.

Oh, they're just saying this because Neil, I have, you know, I have no interest in the outcome of this one way or the other because I'm not going to be here anyway. We're just trying to find out because this I've been commissioned to do a study here. Because maybe they're going to get serious about it. I have very serious doubts about that because I have to equip an eight working. But maybe they're going to get serious one of these days. Or maybe the new owners when they sell it might want to get serious. They'll get serious one by one. But if they want to keep anybody because the new owners probably are going to be really smart. We have an open line in day at 622 and we have one on the out of town line. One triple eight four seven four nine four six three and of course, if you're listening on the audio net, I don't call us because you don't know what's going on here anyway. Mind your own business.

Gilbert going to another market and calling up Bob Blanceter and tapots and oh Bob hi you really great yeah of course Gilbert would do that he'd Gilbert would do with anybody to put him on here and I don't know why would Gilbert be invited on that show anyway I mean are we inviting these people for who we don't even know to call us next thing we'll be getting the call from what's his from a start of English but we figure that we screen our calls the same way that he does as an only but you know when I was on Zeta one time we used to call Tanner and we used to call Joey and when he was on she we called the Sunny Park and even the Greg Vidal who at the time liked it and later on got pissed off and blamed us for getting a point to share but everybody would talk to us on here and all the competing shows and we called Howard one morning and they got very very up at Ian Snottie is producer like boy Gary and well we don't need you know we don't need to talk to you because you're just

And the food too. Anyway, so I'm factoring in some of these<|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|><|zh|> too, so if the numbers don't drive, those of you who are busy bodies keep in track at home and try to make sure that I'm giving you the right numbers. I'm not going to waste my time going through all the facts since I got a pile over here and facts as to. We got piles. Believe me. So let's see, give you an interim update so far. In case you're joining us in midstream we're doing a very important scientific research here that I've been commissioned to do to find out the new W-I-D. We're not, you know, I mean, for you to do on your own show and ask you like me, I'm at self-aggrandizing anyway, in addition to which we don't want no negative votes. And the same with the Rick and Sides, they're like them and yours truly, they were the only things left from the older Ray G. So it don't count. We're talking about all these great new things, the new packs and things like Ron and Ron. So far, three thumbs up and 13 thumbs down. As in, they're starting slow, but they're building. William, it's tied, I better take another facts here. Okay, let's take the next facts and untie that. Ron and Ron thumbs down. William Robert thumbs up. He's ahead, 98. Just to piss off George with the mouthful of food. Brooke Daniels, a small thumb up. We'll take any thumb. Karen K th uh, thumbs down. Same boring topic, the entire show. And the jingle thumbs down. Let's see, Karen K so far, she's got, oh, thumbs up, none and 15 down. Brooke is doing well. She's got 12 up and four down. And the jingle is two up and 15 down. Okay. All right, it's 1135 at W-I-O-D. At least we got the audience involved in the radio station. Again, we know that this is much too inside. And it's much too, you know what I'm saying? It's too in like everything else I do. But at least we're getting them involved again in this place. Even though they've learned to hate it. Here's Miami Beach, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Meal? Yes, I am. Good morning. Are you calling to participate in our scientific survey? Yes, and then you made me hungry. I'm going to have to go over the bread. Cause we're right through the wings. Excellent. Good choice. You're all man. There you go. And give my big kiss for us. Okay. Okay. You're still your picture still there. I know. That old fat picture makes me feel better.

Because there ain't nothing is good. Man, oh man. It's like that sausage lady that we had that bid before. These white hots. Oh, man. Woo. We, in fact, I have to. I have to sit here and think really twice. You know, I'm sitting here looking at that big cardboard cutout of Enrique. And I got this white hot here right on my plate in front of me. And I have to really think very, very long and hard about which one is perfect. So hard. Yeah, kind of looks that way. Here is Fort Pierce. Hello. Okay. Hello. Yes, sir. I want to participate. In Fort Pierce. Yes. A great place to be fraught. I have to drive around old during the day just to catch your signal. Well, good for you. How about the other stage?

The worst. And the jingles and rejoins. The old, the oldy, moldy 50s music jingles. Terrible. Give them an ax. Okay. Good luck, pal. Thank you. Have a great life. This guy called. I'd like that because he cares enough to try to save W. I. O. D. I think we ought to be really honored and impressed by the fact that there were so many people see this is what it's all about. I hate to break the news to people like Walter Sabo all these experts. All these people think they see this ain't Orlando. This ain't Tampa, not Orlando. It's not clear water. It's not Jacksonville. It's not Jacksonville. Florida or Sarah Carolina. It's not Memphis. It's not even because of him. This is Miami. He makes the audience. This is a part of their lives. It's so boring here and believe me when I tell you that we make this a very important part of their lives. That's what it's all about. So you can think it's really inside. You can think it's so whatever you want to think, but believe me, this is the bread and butter. This is the meat and potatoes. I think I'm choking on that right now. Or is it just a bacon? Oh boy, these are good. Man, oh man. Yeah, I started to gag it on a white hud just a second ago in the middle of that call before we tried to apologize profusely. Although I noticed a cardboard cutout started smiling. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, now are you doing great. I like to participate in you, sir. Okay, sir. Ron and Ron. I love him. All right. William Robert Schwartz III. Hey, he's okay. Okay. Broke Daniels. I like him. Karen Kaye. He's a sick bitch. And the jingles and read joins. Ah, throw him away. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you.

When is the as Joe? Jose. Ron and Ron thumbs down. The news third guy thumbs up. Brook Daniels down. So I wonder why Rick Riley was sucking around with him so much yesterday. He must have taken his own survey. I have never heard such shameless suction. I told Rimmer on the phone yesterday. Even he has never sucked anything so hard. As Rick Riley sucked William shorts his Jones turds the a turd yesterday. That's really a clock. What was supposed to be like a two minute newscast turned into a ten minute newscast because Rick insisted out reading a story about how William milled for the turd saved somebody's life with a home. Whatever that was with home deep. Was that what it was? With the kidney? Oh, with the kidney thing. And just just herniating the suction. I am embarrassed for Rick Riley. Okay. In other words, it's one thing to come on and say good job. And I realize he's praying and hoping that he might continue to be around here after next February. But I wouldn't count on it. But I mean for him to get on here and tell William mill for the turd. Enjoy your penis. I mean, I thought that was going a little bit too far. Brook Daniels thumbs down on this one and jingles and Karen Kay also a big, big fat. No. On this one. Okay. Thank you so much Joe Jose. This is fun. This is more fun. And we've had last two days. I'll tell you that. We're looking. We're having a good meal. Harry Venus is walking around. Have a great time eating some free food. Trying to get the lay of the land here.

It was an error in communication No, no, but you said it wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. You I want you to apologize for saying it wrong If I understood that I had to look at your schedule to see when you were out of town use you spot I would have slept the car running with the keys in and of course my 97 vet I would have just left it running out on the road there. I would have run in check with 85 secretaries and seen if you were out of town or not Why didn't you tell me that okay? I cannot apologize for your failure to understand what I was saying But I will say it's a big sand squid Well, you didn't understand what the school board did get nice.

No, no, no, no, you want to put the light bulb off the map No wonder buddy, but got rid of that thing you said something on Passover on pace off. Yeah, that was in there Right pace of is pretend to be a real Jew pace off. Yes, you said something that was inaccurate like what? You failed to tell the public when you did your show that I reason that the school board's a liar and the reason to school board Selected that day to be a teacher's worth nothing worse than because they knew that so many people Just got the street to shoot the corner of a sterling there in the 440 want to talk to the Indians There's nothing worse than being an Indian giver. I want an apology right now from you that you know They that you got all been under shape. I mean even if you were upset that I was probably going there in a wrong day Why didn't you at least come me some slack and say he misunderstood? Instead of putting a note on my beautiful car on my beautiful Corvette and running around a building like an Napoleon here like a Jewish Napoleon Well, I got your attention tonight. You got my attention so you could come in here and plug your radio station and good luck to it Well, I appreciate that, but I will say this about parking space because it wasn't misunderstood. Yeah, I'm gonna give my secretary my schedule And I meant what I told you I didn't mean park for the whole shift meal.

And the news guy by the way, William, Milhaos, Nick's in the third. Who will not acknowledge me because I said yesterday. Because I said yesterday something that he got very uptight and upset about. Okay. Like. What an absolute asshole you are. Which I thought. If you write into that particular newscast. There's almost anyone he does. And he got all been out of shape about that. But they still love him. He's way ahead, George. I'll give you the number the next hour. But just suffice it to say he's going to win big. Yeah. Too bad. Okay. Quit playing a crap in there. I'm telling you. You better watch yourself, Mr. Little Spick. Little grease ball. That that CT. He's looking for a job out here. Yeah.

Just until you leave. And then after that burn up. So that they don't have them. So what does that mean? Well for now. Okay. And what else? Oh. Avalanche, order thing. Wouldn't it be the advantage to the defending team who was actually getting a goal put into the, you know, into their net to push the opposing player into the crease so that the goal doesn't get allowed? Good point. Another reason that the rule sucks. All right. See you. Good night. Later. I'll read it out. Sure. Good night. See you. Okay. Let's get to these other ones here. Oh, look who we got.

I mean, I would put it down if he was sincere, but you could tell. He almost broke in a laughter. Okay. Couldn't keep a straight push on the phone. It's one thing you can't keep a straight face. You know, face to post. But he couldn't keep a straight face on a phone. Speaking of a straight push. Okay. I like to take the survey. Yeah. Bet you would. How about taking two aspirin instead? Let's go. You ready? I'm going to be handle a pressure. Yes. I doubt it. Ron and Ron. Down. Wait in the third. Excellent. Rook Daniels. No way. Keren K.

I mean, you can't possibly strike out. Every dog has its day. There's an old saying. If you throw enough crap up here sooner or later or some of it. We'll come down and hit the ground. I mean, there's got to be somebody out there. Somebody. We just hope they don't get in the next minute. Here's Hiley. Hello. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, sir. I like to take the survey. Put on in that.

The worst park radio ever heard in my life. And the jingles. Okay. That's it. I mean, I tried. I tried like here like milk as long as I could. I squeezed it. I acted. That's it. Nothing left. So we'll tabulate the molder in the newscast with award winning journalist. Now he didn't even know what award he wanted. He won the seal of approval from the IOD audience award. In spite of the fact that George is highly pissed off about it. Adam is not too happy about it. Wayne is foaming at the mouth about it. And Rick is like tickling himself. He's so happy. Rick loves him. In fact, I heard him yesterday say. I wanted it. He likes it because there's a wife likes it. Oh, Rick's wife likes like he's a Rick's former. Oh, I see. She is wife thinks that he's Jesus and drag. You don't mean Rick's wife to former cheerleader, do you? Karen. 1257 a W.I.O.D. Hey, let me tell you right now. If your bank is screwing your own like Rick Riley's bank is screwing him around. Hey, grow up here. Go in there and say I'm a big shot. Blow it out your ass. Give me my money. I'm going to family bank. That's what I did several months ago. And I realize your deposits will not be quite as large as mine. But nevertheless, you got a substantial amount of cash you're making here. Take it to a bank where they're not going to screw up all your uh, I can't believe that story. Yes, I can. I can't believe it because I've had my own horrible nightmare stories. And you all have to. Big banks are impersonal. They don't care no matter what their slogans are no matter what they tell you. You're just a number in a computer. Even if you got millions, you just a small tiny wheel in their big thing. Do you know what I'm saying? Exactly. So get your ass over there. Tell them, give me all my money. Have a great life. I'm going to family bank. Family bank offers you the lowest service fee in Broward. They got all the features of even the big big shot banks. They got ATMs at all locations. They got drive-throughs that open every day of the week except Sunday. Monday through Friday at 8 o'clock in the morning even Saturday morning nine to noon. They got seven convenient Broward locations. And they treat you like a man. They treat you like a real human being. They treat you with care and kindness. Go into the sawgrass branch there. And if you treat him real nice, Matt will even patch you on the head. Family bank. Do a business the way you like personal and friendly. Member FDIC. 6th-hand WIOD. Neal Rogers. While you're goofing off it work. But what I, but when I'm not so friendly either, 6th-hand WIOD. If you want to do our... I like it. How do you like this so far? Let's take a poll on it. Okay. I'm telling you the machines acted up today. You just can't get nothing to play. Well that's okay. It gives us more time. Give us more time to sink our teeth into this important thing. It does. It does. It was a little reluctant I guess. Oh my, it's 5,288V. 5,288V. 5,288V. And everybody knows that a foot is 12 inches. 12 inches in length. That's 63,360 inches. And I'm like 63,360 inches in a while. Oh the average body has 45 miles of nerve. 45 miles. That's 2,855. And you are getting all never eight inches. You are getting all never eight inches. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. You are getting all never eight inches. Oh, alright. One way to WIT. Maybe we can make a special dedication from that, huh? I don't want to mention anybody by name. Okay, here's the results. Here are the results. Of our massive commission study this morning of the WIOD audience or what's left of it. Here we go. The Ron and Ron show. Man, they have a lot of work to. It's so embarrassing to do. Look at that 12 plus votes. Only one person to wait and never listen. And 51 in the negative to recall. 12 plus 51 thumbs way down. And like I said, lots of work to do. Unbelievable. William Henry Milford, Nixon Schwartz, public goldstein the third. Like I predicted, the big winner. And spite of all your outrageous comments and your refusal to deal with. I predicted it. I predicted it. Man, I was right on target as usual. The third out 47 years and only 18 days. That's just stupid. They love him. William Milford, Milhouse Nixon Schwartz the third is a smash. Make no mistake about it. And if Rick Ron could have gotten a vote, it would have been 547 away. Brooke Daniels, she was like up and down and back and forth. But in a stretch like a great racehorse, like a real thoroughbred she came through. Just pounding her hoofs down a stretch. And she could have ordered a couple of thumbs. 37 years, 25 days and one who'd all listen to that hour. 37, 25, not bad, not bad for this very, you know, kind of picky audience. I'm going to save this one here. The one I'm going to move to the bottom of the list now. Jingles and rejoins, all those real fancy, fancy things that you just absolutely see the stuff that Boca Bryant does. Like this. They say go, go, go, go. They say go, go, go. They say go, go, go, go. That would probably got 100 rating. And do you know, you're going to be a good one. But anyway, so we had 10 positive and 49 negative on the new Jingles on his John Ford. Because after all, you know, he's a creative monster. He's a creative freaking genius. 10 years and 49 days. Now we get down to the, we get down to the one category that I must confess. I, you know, I read this. I announced it. I passed it along with considerable reservation, you know what I'm saying? Because it is so embarrassing. It is so mortifying. Now, what are these facts? Let's see. WMD should try a carnival atmosphere of the next personal appearance. You could put current K in the dunk tank. Tie her to Jeff Heye. It says, every. Everything is fine, except her. How do you like that? Woo! Even the facts here is our getting psychotic. They're pit-off. Here's another one. Tell Jack Mark. There's an opening for a way to read corkies. And I'm sure they mean the one in North Miami Beach on 160 Tertis been closed for a year. Here's another one. It says, I heard the care and casheo for the first time a few days ago. I hate to say. Now you're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. You're not being selective when you go through these. It's a really scary way. Okay, thank you Sheery for your first vacation's observation. Okay, here's one. Okay, no more votes. Somebody's out of what's there for. And is this one? This guy only sends us 4,500 faxes. Okay, so blow it out your ass. Okay, did I get to the caring key number? The worst talker you ever heard in my life on WOT. Okay, let's start with the people who never heard of you. Okay, let's try to do this as gently as we can. Six people just don't listen to night. Okay, that's understandable. 59 people voted in the negative to 59 people said thumbs down and most of them they very heated in passionate matter. Most of them said like that. Various forms of pain. And in the plus column we've got a big fat. Oh, let me say it again. And the positive column in the thumbs up column we've got the big. Oh, how do you like that? Now what what the hell does that mean? What are we going to do about this, huh? What are we going to do? I got you down. How about this ridiculous situation here? Well, it rest, you know, speaks for itself. That's it. It speaks for itself. So there you go. And you certainly can't say our influence that because the news guy was the big winner. He was the big winner, George hands down going away. Champion 4718. That was the overwhelming, the big, the hot shot. That was the big success story today. Was William Preston, mill for a Joan Schwartz, Billy Bob the third. He won hands down. OK, let's get some instant analysis on this from our Perseplication Saudi Insuffer. They're date county 622Wild, Broward 767, toll free outside 1884, 740, Purple Line, Pau Nio de Etc. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Neil, God. Yes, sir. Got to figure it out. We're based on your poll. I now know who's going to replace you when you go down the dial. All Karen. Now Robert Milster, the tight. Robert Milford, the turn. He'll be great in like two minutes at a time. He'll be dynamite. He's doing stand-up comedy now, isn't he? He's sitting down. He's hunched over. He's doing hunch-over comedy. Neil, between that and the jingles, I mean, the word you use, soft mark. Yeah. I mean, it's a joke. It's great. It's got to stop. Yeah. I hear the people down the end of the dial are pretty excited about it. Hey, let me ask you this, Neil. It also says there. Yes. Being that Wayne's running the station over there. No, he is not.

Absolutely not from ten to two. You can go to the bank on that. Well, you're ten to two, but all the other stuff like now is he, you said something other day about Marlins or they can't talk about the heat or something. That was a hundred years ago. It was like months ago. OK, but that's not telling the Humper what to say. The Humper has been ripping him up ballspot. OK, good, good. I good close friend the Humper. Is he going to buy that station or not? No, he's not. What does he have to buy it for when he can, you know, get all this free crap out of them and they're paying him for the rights? No, because now I see, you know, sports channel and then the radio station and then what the hell's next? Let me say it again. They're paying him 35. May you're watching he buy it. OK. There you go. God bless. I rest my case. My great day. OK. What is he saying? One 14 at W. I. OD on a great Thursday, man.

Today on the flat black bit show, Sheldon Kennedy is going to be on. Oh no. She's going to make them cry. Isn't that something? Well, that shouldn't be too hard. Is he going to be wearing that little Roman Faggy haircut again? Yeah. Oh, God. Crying in the commercial. Oh, do we have to hear those stories about it? Is wrecked toolman all that stuff again? Exactly. It's going to be great though. Okay. I never watched the show. I saw the commercial. I'm going to watch it just for that. Robb say that what to watch is a littleBC that dipping Just around here. Yeah. It won't end up going. Well, there is also some money on the market. Sprinkle something. Is this the standard 101? Yeah. I специously picked one because the amount is wrong. It's gone 있어서. What did you do? And the jingles? Okay, thank you so much. Yes, I hear the thing from Fato with the jelly donut. The thing from Fato, you mean that he ate the feeding frenzy? Yeah, with the jelly donut. Oh, you got it. Oh, see ya. Oh, God. We don't want to play that. We'll get everybody frantic. I like lobster and koggle. Part of her? Little pie with chocolate chip ice cream. Okay, we'll chocolate chip ice cream is good. Ring ding. Ah. And chocolate surprise. Wait, chocolate swirl ice cream, even better. That's nothing. Did you ever suck the jelly out of a jelly donut and then fell with chocolate swirl ice cream? Ah. I like to stuff a jelly donut for the Reese's Pinot Buttercup. Then put it in a warm oven and lift the chocolate and everything melted into the dough. Hmm. How about peanut butter and jelly? Or a chocolate-covered grey mcracket. Within my years of demand around time. Mmm. Could I have a little lemon in my water, please? I make chocolate chip cookies with eminems. It's not a chocolate chip. They don't melt me. Yeah. So, you can have a little more lemon in my hot water, please. Just a lot of lemon. Uh, no, I'd like a little fresh orange juice squeezed in my end if you got it. No, sorry. Okay, that lemon. The Croes, they got chocolate-covered orange, which is the juice just dribbles down your chin. Oh. Junior, could I have just a drop of honey in this, please? Just a drop. Which of the actual fruit is covered with that thick dark chocolate? You know? Oh, boy. I'd like to write this stuff on an amin' a donut. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Get the honey, Junior. Give me the honey, Junior. It's in the cover, though. Well, get it. What else did they cover with that chocolate? It means besides the orange, which is grapes, peaches, strawberries. Junior, the honey. Those big juicy stem strawberries are dipped into that dark dark chocolate. Mmm. Jack, the honey. Jack, the honey. Oh, we know. Oh, there ain't nothing like it. Baby, gritty. Get that. Grab my Junior, honey. Exactly. One of the great movies of all times, if you're sitting around bored to, oh, I guess what's going to be on Sunday by the way. The last dawn, if you've seen the previous for that, Mary O'Poozo, thumbs up or thumbs down. We'll find out Monday. Is that a one-drop party or is that like, uh, we'll find out, like I said. Here's Tamarack. Hello. Tamarack. You know how they just, did you crank that up or did they do it? I believe, and the future won't stop. And then he growled. Oh, great. Okay. There's a stock item. It means we better turn on the CNBC. That must be, that's probably a silent, uh, oh, look at that market's up 119, the Nasdaq's up 14. And the standard in poor isn't out, we all, uh, 12 points. So, big deal. That's basically, uh, yesterday, Ying and Yang, it went down yesterday. It took a crap today. It's going back up. Like I said, like, one of the track, but they don't put on a good show. Two open lines in Broward, 767 Wild, one in day, 6229463. Steve came, thumbs up or thumbs down. Here's you new midday host. He'll be starting any day now. Steve came produced by Nick Lawrence. It's going to be like old times. Sake. Here's the sunny hours on a mobile. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil, but see me, Rogers. See, uh, William Millhouse, the direct is a pimps. Yeah. Garbage. Can I ask you to find a pole is over sir. He went out. He won hands down. He won overwhelmingly. But I got on the line officially before the one A. Well, don't count too bad. We closed the crew. I got my point across. Okay. Let's send Neil question for you. At piece of garbage that called you a couple weeks ago from Pembro, uh, an African from Central Village. Which piece of garbage was that? Well, let me give you an example. You have your chronic factors and quarters. Correct. You want to even get my time of day. Yeah. Make mention of this direct on the phone and direct on the facts. And you just blow it off. Yeah. Well, Howard, he basically treats this guy. Or this is the same thing with Howard. However, he gives him at least 30 to 40 seconds of airtime. He at least does him that favor. The treatment that you've heard him receive from Howard that you played Yeah. He's the exact kind of treatment that gets this guy's guard. But he's not associated with that show at all. Yeah. And I think the hostility of Howard has more towards him as opposed to the poor victim that he victimizes such as you or any other radio station. Yeah. The guy is a nut. Well, that's what it sounded like to me because he was denying that he said all this crap to me, which we all heard him say it. And then Howard said, yes, you did, etc. And so on. Oh, paste this. This is mentally retarded. Well, the guy that called here just called to try to stir up a bunch of crap. Yes, you said, you had one of our spies out there as you heard. Headed on tape, and we headed like in a heartbeat. I wish I had on texts with the ton of dialogue that is really carried across with this guy. Melrose, you know, the guy who is such a loop is very given some material. Yeah. People can see how he treats the guy like garbage. Yeah, it's true. You can spit on him. It's not over the first two hundred times. We know he's all loose. Already? worse than William the Tird. Well, in the turn at least as a professional. This guy is nothing. He's just an amateur chronic. In other words, Howard Stone will send him out to you know, events and he'll get arrested for example when the O. J. trial was going on in LA. Yeah. The second trial. Do you remember there was a guy carrying like a skeleton hanging up? Tell me if he's the news report to you guy with a skeleton. Not really. Or or cross behind O. J. Yelling murder or murder. Yeah. That was this. That's really. Yeah. And he had a good point anyway. I like that. He had a good point. But yeah. I'm starting to like this guy. Exactly. But that's what he is. So he's a chronic and you know, he gives you him time on the air. He loves it. You know, they never again ever happen again. Please, if you can do that, you know, you make me very happy. Okay. Go Sabers. Okay. See you later. Good luck. Good luck to you, pal. Oh, man. And by the way, I guess he didn't get my message yesterday. O. J. We don't want you here. They got this big celebrity golf tournament coming up this weekend and for a very good reason, which is a good cause. One of those charities. And it's going to get all screwed up. It's already getting screwed up, screwed, screwed, screwed up. It's screwed up. It's screwed up. Because they got the cancellations because O. J. Well, he was a part of a group that paid to be in a well, that's a pretty lame excuse. Tom, to give him his money back. We don't want him here. Okay. Nobody wants to be associated with him with that murdering piece of direct. Oh, well, the juicer. And then of course, they had they had these three black guys were involved with the charity thing with a golf part of it. And they didn't want to talk. They did that. Nothing to do with the juice. Anybody that calls him the juice. He ought to be getting the juice. This is what he ought to be getting. Boy, did that frost my ass. Get him out of town. We don't want him here. Send him someplace else. And I noticed they kept showing all these shots of him playing golf out there the other day. And man, he was just running around and wacking it in the ball too. Didn't look like that. Our throitis was bothering him in the least bit. Do we know the name of that golf course that let us in there? No, we do not. Well, we'll find out. And then, in fact, we're, we're the third just got through saying that it was supposed to be at the rail. And they've moved it to an undisclosed place because they don't want somebody off of them there. Or for whatever reason, because they're probably to embarrass at this point. Get out of here, OJ, go find somebody who likes you somewhere. Like maybe the heavens gate people know where to go. 1, 29 at Wild. He's got him boiling at Kendall Toyota. Well, kind of like Luke warm today. The heat keeps on rolling. Right? That's what it says here, even only lost last night. Edwin Pope says they choked. Well, they've choked those prices down to a very minimum of Kendall Toyota. See, I told you we did something in here. Kendall's got prices that will knock your thing right off. Just listen to these ridiculously though prices on great brand new 1997 Toyota's 97 to ourselves from just 99 91 brand new Corolla's from just 10,0991 brand new 97 to Colmas from just 10,091 and brand new beautiful cameras starting at just 15,091. You can't beat the prices anywhere. You can't beat the service. You can't beat their TV show. You just can't beat it. So instead of sitting around trying to beat it, get your car and head for Kendall Toyota just out the day land on US one. Prices include all rebates and incentives on a pro credit quantity is limited. So hurry on down. The opinions expressed on Wild are those of Neil Rogers. Okay, Amen. You got it. You got it. Down perfect, man. You got the formula. There are other opinions, but not for long. 610. Wild. and doa doahh. N<|en|> over.
