What an absolute asshole you are. Hey guys, how do you like your steak? I want something with a little kid. Something with some bowl. I want something so spicy, it gets me right over here. And over here. Yeah, here, here. And even here, right in my... In fresh steak. Yeah, something bowl. The steak's so bold that if I bought it over my... I couldn't fit for a week. Yeah, bowl. The steak's so bold that if I shoved it up my... I could breathe fire for a month. Hey, that's pretty f*** bold. Each one bowl steak sauce. For guys who like their steak with big flavor. Each one bowl is for you. I want to steak sauce so bold. So boldly that if I eat a whole bottle, I'll have a flame coming out of my... Like the freaking space shuttle. Hey, come down over there. Just the f*** steak sauce. Each one bowl steak sauce. Now that's bold. Funny after a ten a WOD, pour some on your apple sauce and you're putting by the way, before you off yourself. By the way, he didn't have cancer. Oh, sorry. Damn it. Too late now. And they were all castrated too by the way. Because that's all of them are just most of them. I think all of them. Well, maybe not the women. They were castrated. They had their things cut off. What do you mean most of them? I thought they were all finished. The initial report said that some of them may all work castrated. I didn't hear the... But in here with the coroner said... You call that a penis? Exactly. They were castrated, man. They were ballas and brainless. But they were very nice people. When is the media going to stop with this crap Thomas about what? They were morons. They were idiots. They were people with no lives. The one guy for crying out loud even went to U of M. Do you need to know any more than that? No life. Morons. Idiots. Dummies. They're going to get on the... The... Comments coming. And they're all of a sudden going to shed these bodies. And they're going to wind up on serious. And they're going to... What are they going to do up there? Now that they're castrated, they're evidently not going to have a two bit of a time up there. So what's the point when you come right down to it? Of course he was a fact. Here's my amy. Hello. Hi Uncle Neil. Yes sir. Actually the castration was based on a coin toss. No why. No. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Well that's the question. Isn't it. That's what Marshall Apple what used to as tails or head. One of the survivors actually was on the news. I had to go. One guy didn't go the hallway I guess. And he said he was one of the lucky ones because he just had a daughter I guess. So yeah. Got a crazy. But I called it actually. One of the things I think is funny. You know how every few years they have these people and statues that have Stick-monna and they have blood from their palms etc. Yeah. You know the stupid thing about that is that Jesus was nailed and is rusted his hands. So he wouldn't be bleeding from the palms of his hands. But how could he have palms Sunday? What are you going to have wrists? How about limprist Sunday? First thing I like hash Wednesday. Live limprist Sunday ain't bad that they were celebrating the Vatican. I'll guarantee you that. Sure. Uh-huh. They got that right close for it. Uh-huh. Anyway, I can be. You have people believe this crap. You know what? Like people. I mean, the people who lived then 2000 years ago, they said, who the hell are you kidding? And those were the dumbest superstitious people of all, and they didn't believe it. Keep barnavint in. Oh, my. Ripley were the ones. We're in the right line of business. Jesus, God and Joseph. There he ain't good people's money. Okay, God bless you, my son. See ya. Dave County, 62, come on. Let's get some spiry ports on that simulating game on Saturday. Let's go. Go out of town for a couple of days for a nice weekend. I don't want to mention I had Laura Seekord ice cream at the Eaton Center. That would be bad. But go out of town for a couple of days. Come back and wait and get filled in. I'm sure I missed a dynamic performance in section 124. Hey, ref, you suck. Yeah, right. We're going to lynch that damn rat guy today. Or what was the next home game? Uh, what is the next week? God, we're on the road all week. What a pleasure. What a myhaya. We have like a little break now. Next home game. We're lynching the rat man up there in 124. I still think it's a good idea. Instead of having the amaz got, instead of having Stanley Seep Panthers slide down that thing before the game. We're just going to let them. We're going to grease that thing up real good. Let the rat man slide down it. On a date, you go. One day the rat man is about 600 feet above. Hey, rat man, use suck. What an asshole I guess. I mean, it was great during the playoffs all the enthusiasm. But this guy's out of control doesn't have any idea. He fits in like a glove because he has no idea what the game's all about. And these people, the loudest ones are the ones who don't know what they're talking about. Ever noticed that? Like I know his talk shows. Oh, sorry. Here's plantation. Hello. Plantation. Hello. Yes, sir. Have a meal. are you today wonderful come a style I think you forgot me I forgot you what you remember in the end guy came to your car oh you said I got a place something I said I'm gonna play it

what does that mean that they're circumcised what what is that what's the significance I'm sure it means something is it like putting the ashes on your forehead oh thank God we don't do those ridiculous barbaric stupid idiotic things anymore in the world today thank the Lord thank God that the Orthodox Jews aren't the and then that course I haven't even commented on that because it's so typical where the Orthodox Jews now are they had a big thing on the CNN over the weekend about that that's right if you're not real super orthodox you're not like a real Jew no matter how close they cut it to the bone no matter how well a little you got left like in my case you're still not know how many how many home and touch you wait you're still out of real Jew only they got the answers and you want to know why because they're just like the right wing Christians man they're crazy in a bedbug well we don't like your views on both sexuality and about abortion all the so the crap sounds for me you're huh so when you talk and religious fanatics it don't make any difference whether the Jews or Goi and were Arabs or whatever they are in fact when you talk in religion general why is he

Park in the park Sheridan Plaza got it when I was 23 I was married to a widow who was pretty as could be this widow had a grown-up daughter who had hair a friend my father fell in love with her and soon they two were wed this made my dad my son and law and changed my very life for my daughter was my mother because she was my father's wife to complicate the matter even though it broke me joy I soon became the father of the bouncing baby boy my little baby them became a brother and lot of dad and soon became my uncle though it made me very sad where if he was my uncle then that also made him brother of the widows grown a daughter who of course was my step mother fathers wife then had a son who kept them on the run and he became my grandchild because he was my daughter son my wife is now my mother's mother and it makes me blue because although she is my wife she's my grandmother too if my wife is my grandmother then I'm her grandchild and every time I think of it it nearly drives me wild for now I have become the strangers case you ever saw as husband of my grandmother I am my own grandfathers I'm my own grandfathers I'm my own grandfathers it sounds funny I know but it really is so yes I'm my own grandfathers 1032 W.I.O.D. at Wonder why that is your 20th week I think the reason for that be I don't know I have no idea quite frankly couldn't care less we have an open line at a mobile one purple line pound I.O.D. let's hear about that game Saturday not oh my god so Michael Mayow by the way has a big column in the paper I knew sooner or later he'd come around not that's right guess what he's writing about this morning in a son Sentinel he's writing about and I would check the weekend papers just to make sure okay what is with this overhead by the way George this thing sounds like crap it sounds like direct today what the hell I love these weekends I love coming on Monday and over the weekend Friday everything was great it was sensational and you come in on a Monday no matter where you work and it's like everything's been reconfigured and reshrewed around and it sounds bizarre man it sounds bizarre so what is Michael Mayow right about a whole big column on the back page of course on a son Sentinel sports section today where it belongs so he can wipe his ass with it mustard's revenge sweet as apple pie Tomas Mooster mustard booster whatever the hell his name is a bunch of tennis crap now we know that wants to find a time when he was like a little boy Michael Mayow used to write about tennis before he like graduated beyond that and wrote about real sports but now it is you write a whole column look at that the whole damn page long about tennis does he mention anything in there I noticed Tom jicker wrote a big column about David Halberstam and what a great guy he is and how Eddie Kaplan likes him and he never stole a freight train I was going Tom by the way get rid of that picture you look like it all far down the chemo therapy if you see that picture a jicker in the paper the one where he looks like he's done 20 years of chemo I'm serious I mean I know we're all getting older Tom could come on talk about unflaidering so nice job Michael Mayow's you continue not to do what you promised you would do and you just don't have the scrotum to do it man it pisses me off is there anybody in this town who's not a bull crap artist that's what I'd like to know just one bull crap artist after another oh yeah I'm gonna write a retraction I'm gonna least write that I wish I wouldn't have written that last thing and I don't want to see the guy fired well he's not getting fired I realized that but why don't you live up to what you promised we heard it right here on the show you jack as you why can't you do it I mean if you got that much space why can't you like why we you know they put the little stars near the little ass to risk maybe you don't want to risk his ass maybe the sunset and I won't let him put it in there that's what I'm hearing are you that much of a pussy that you're letting the newspaper dictate what you're gonna put in your column I noticed they didn't have any objections to the first column when you ripped David Halberstam and asked and asked for him to be fired which I think we ought to get a firing squad from Michael Mayo get him into guy the rat guy from the hockey games get the two of them together and take care of their ass right now there you go the rat guy and speaking of newspapers and bizarre things and how can we have an out of call about this yet this morning Chris we haven't had a call about too much it's Monday what do you expect there's a thing in the living arts section in the world that they would say don't read the hill though it was laying around the price was right it was free and I look in here and it says play ball is the cops take the pro player field on opening day we compare the goods and vads of South Florida versus those of the windy city and it's got a list it doesn't see who wrote this crap it just says the list okay and if I were whoever responsible for this column I wouldn't put my name on his piece of crap either and it goes on about opening day 1997 the cup is visit the marlins at your Robbie stadium papa papa papa this and it says let's not fall into rampant homerism here even though the cups have about as much chance of reaching the world series this year as Neil Rogers and the marlins look like fierce fish indeed what is that mean they have about as much chance of reaching the world series this year as Neil Rogers I got news for you guys I'm probably gonna be going to the world series whether anybody knows you're not and then it goes on to compare you know what they got in Chicago what we got here like as if there's some comparison between the two cities other than the weather taken a weather out which we can't control like it says they have deep dish of Kagustal pizza we got rice and beans okay we got arroz con uh not that's chicken we got rice and beans they got deep dish pizza the greatest if you like that stuff which weighs about 85 pounds of pie and we got rice and beans as in great I rest my case they got here we Carter we got rid of Gary Carter they got holy cow we have in the wind column oh geez not your angel with that contrived excitement again but anyway it's in the they have Sally fits we had Sally fits as in so it any right great column again and what tell my name I guess it's just a gratuitous way to drop my name in as if saying we got new arroz isn't they don't which is the only thing beside the weather that we got here that's worthwhile because the rest of it tried to compare this town as Chicago is a joke I mean Chicago is one of the few big cities in his country where it's like clean clean I'm not talking about Cicero now I'm talking about downtown the loop like most of the city you know where the white people are it's clean it's beautiful it's great the food is great rush street is great everything is great but hey but we got a nice weather here's Miami hello hello yes sir I went to the game Saturday alright here we go here's the report I've had missed the game in four years yes of worst crowd in history of the world what do you mean size no Yahoo I mean they were cheering and you suck and they were cheering for miss checks yeah I mean it was terrible I don't think anybody knew about hockey they don't they I mean the fourth year almost over now and they still know nothing is crowd I mean I said here day after day try to just have even if I take 10 minutes out of the day to have a meaningful conversation about the greatest sport in the world and these people here know nothing they don't know what they're watching out there and half of them left during the third period I could with 20 minutes I was like 15 minutes left ago nice well it was a boring game too by the way notice another short-handed goal against the star Robbie Zameter yeah hell of a player by the way and did you know that our Robbie New Year mayor was a member of having skate call he doesn't have a pair yeah I know that he's he's waiting to get in by the way he could make it in yeah thanks for the good news sorry I missed that sorry it wasn't here for that game Saturday and by the way who was that sitting in your seats probably Jeff Rimmer's wife and some friend I guess since I gave Ferole the seats because I knew I was gonna be here I don't want no empty seats I wanted some asses in those seats okay but evidently I missed a real coma inducing performance and the rumor has it that Eddie Joe is a getting benched or got benched for that game or or whatever the deal is and long overdue was all I can say oh and we had a guy get a home from the getting the car to airport last night and turn on this radio station in theirs guess who was on here doing sports talk it was right as it was in fact it was the post game show it was that's me yeah doing a post game show after the heat cave didn't lost to the raptors no less in Toronto to the raptors no less and then they come on at six o'clock with sports talk which I keep winning every every few days we keep hearing that this is the last sports talk show on IOD the way keep you're in that they keep threatening this is the last sports talk show ever ever well maybe and then you're doing it on the weekend and there's another one so feel that's been as I would some guy and I'm thinking who is this guy that he's got on with him and what are they arguing about again I shouldn't even mention it about the stew barn straightened about Chris Wells and I'm thinking Jesus are you still with that and the guy's name he had on with him you won't are you ready for this was Saul Steinberg Saul Steinberg don't we have any glam doing sports in this town just one just one besides Joe Rose and Jim and which okay can we have one goy in this town doing sports we got Steinberg in Goldberg and what's what's the and Goldie what's his name Goldstein and the forest who's got a Goyish name but he's another what you did and Robin and and yeah him too another Jew and he says this is the Jew crew because it's Easter Sunday night just one Jew after another doing sports in this town would be like Michael Mayo there's another one what he says name was Moskovitz I agree with that Orthodox rabbi he ain't Jewish I don't care what the hell that what his name was he ain't Jewish but what a disgrace this guy is rambling on I guess they were trying to stir up some controversy or something and maybe get a call which didn't happen but this guy had no idea what a guy from channel 10 I guess who does isn't on the year thank God but he's like the sports what he's he is to channel 10 what Bernie Rose used to be the channel 4 like an impediment

concerned depot said he did in a paper but they run today maybe some college may give you some more juice on that so check it out what was the point though I mean that that people accused of a friend

everybody out yeah one of them right now all right okay I just want to commend you I'm one thing good about a column line you like you made a reference to about the difference between Italians and Italy and Guido yes for so long I've been trying to explain to people the difference and finally someone finally made it clear to everyone and that is you yeah and I just you know I've heard it that day it just made everything come together I mean you go to Italy you don't find anybody who's even remotely like the Guido's you find in New York I mean that's that's not what being Italian is all about traditional which they bastardize the language and this uh material and uh cup of gold and that there are just like all New Yorkers they're very arrogant and they insist that that's the way that wheel Italians pronounce those words and it is not exactly they know nothing about being a Titan in fact most of them probably never been to Italy in their lives and probably wouldn't even get a Visa or a Master Card there exactly and the other thing I want to talk I have two God proud of the question yeah now I bought this book in the book store it's about the Godfather legacy and it said there's a a whole thing together it's called the Godfather trilogy which seems that we're coming out yeah watch board do you know anything about this what do we do I know anything about it I got it yeah you go to a real video store in your pocket that's what you do it work getting of course of course if you got forty fifty hours some day when it's a real boring day when it's raining like hell which any day in the summer here like on a weekend and you sit there and you're pop it in night in the morning and you're all set till about three forty after no it goes on forever it's great okay and the other question I had and like it says they've done it in chronological order so it makes sense right uh the other question I had when the senator in the second movie is in the hotel I offered to you senator is this nothing yes yeah when the girls you know more than the best someone had told me now I disregard this that he killed her my whole thing the whole time was that they set him up that who killed her that uh that he did he was he was in a rage and he killed her and what the hell is that all about a course not that they were what is that they made him an offer they couldn't refuse the the bottom right well I don't know what this person was they were on they were on heavy drugs tell him to take some of tepio computing some apple sauce pheno barbittal be okay there you go well okay can I call someone to do you spend go ahead and you're sour wet do you spend okay all right I'll read it out you okay read it out you child deadlines wide open here this morning it's a typical Monday have had no women call this morning the first hour we're gonna get a woman on during this first hour or not he has no what oh yes we are here's a lady in Hollywood hello I want to know why you're like constantly ripping the fans at the Panther games I mean at least they're the fans that show up consistently and keep selling out that arena because they don't know what tell us going on just showing up you're showing up there and putting your ass in the seat doesn't mean you have any idea what's going on that that's great that it's great that we're to want to answer you want to answer you just want to scream I'm just running the game but at least I show up and I try to get a better knowledge all I ever had here with football yeah I have to educate myself how many years does it take me for people start understanding what's going on in front of them how many years I couldn't afford tickets for a while and I haven't been able to go to the hockey seminars at the Panthers present and another thing is a Chris Wells has been improving well sucks well hockey player Chris Wells blows I mean without Chris Wells there were some games we would have lost because he could up the scoring opportunity oh Mike are you dreaming are you on heavy medication no not at all are you sleeping with Bill Cosby are you eating jello putting by the graceful no but you're never saying anything positive you're Chris Wells blows Chris Wells blows okay when somebody plays good out there I'll tell you go but be very objective you're trying to make a case for a kid that can't play the game no he's talking kaka there was a good bit memorized hard work against the board is gave me a break is first you admit that you don't know anything about the game and how all of a sudden because you like

player we don't need no project so okay we can't we were the Stanley Cup finals last year you don't trade away established good players that score a lot of goals especially when you got a team that can't score well I admit that that we can't score any goals we don't score how many goals did we score how many do we score I'm on Saturday getting rid of one was a mistake okay because it's through all the players off but still we've got to destroy the chemistry of the team destroy the chemistry of the team there's no point in rehashing it it's it was a bad deal and these people out there who

piece and one of the papers over the weekend about all the kids at Michigan now you can't get a ticket to a university of Michigan hockey game whereas of course football used to be the only thing on campus and he has to still jam 170,000 people in the and our brand of stadium but nevertheless hockey is next to football is the hottest thing going on at campus because a lot of the students have discovered this is where the action is this is the greatest sport in the world and I'm the one that turned everybody on to what Panol of a sudden they're the experts and because they just won't go

Now I'm standing 50 floors above where I'll be landing. Oh, I'm family, I will be stranded. Come and jump with me. Okay. Oh, the economy. Wow. This is care. Hundred me. That's the thing that you're always dropping so fast that you can leap your leas getting the hemorrhoids. Okay, it's down 136. You can't even follow the bouncing arrow on CNBC. On the NASDAQs down 22, this could be the day, baby. By the end of the day, we're all wiped out. Okay, look at those phones, man. Speaking of wiped out, we got all the deadlines. We're open 622Wild. We have all the Broward lines. We're open 767Wild. We got one call on the board here at 11 o'clock. On a Monday, is this beautiful or what? No wonder we had Sawsteinburg on the earth the other night. We are just desperate. We're gasping for oxygen here, reaching out to testicles and tentacles. And what do we get that one-sour bitch on there? How come? I don't know what to think about the game. Give me a chance. But, but, but, but, but, but, but, then she goes on to elect you about what a great player number 23 is, which I don't want to mention his game and name again. Anyway screw these people. Okay, I got a great three-page facts here with an naked picture of Josh Moro, who plays Nick on a young and a horny. It says many of you know him as Nick on the CBS soap opera, the young and arrestless, but I knew Josh way before that big break happened. I mean, I was just from a guy or a whatever, doesn't say. But it does say he's straight. Damn it. I'm getting on a soap change as your life suddenly you've got money, people start recognizing you start getting strange letters from Waktao fans. I'll tell you what secret being on a soap isn't really any big deal, not out here. It's great because it's work and actors want to work, but it's considered pretty low on the entertainment of food chain. Personally, I have a group of friends who are working actors, several of them on soap, some of them drop the soap. We think of, uh, it is a job and we don't think of our friends and celebrities, or any of that foolishness. Josh loves to perform. It says. He loves to camera. He used to do a theater out in the valley, anything to have an audience. He used to call me up all the time and say, let's go shoot. Squared, squirt. He'd say, I remember he always used to say, Marco, you're the man, you to man. Bruce Weber also like Josh. Bruce loved Andre, too. He used to call my house in the middle of night to talk to Andre. Anyway, Bruce had, uh, had money to Josh, so he'd eat, uh, right and work out. Josh liked getting naked for pictures. It says he has, uh, had a freedom about that. He's a big flirt and a very girl crazy guy. Most of the time, he has he's straight. And it goes on and on and on. Josh and I shot pictures many times. We shot together. Squared, squirt many times. That Griffin Griffith Park. We shot at the nude beach and in my backyard. We shot out at Medidor Beach one time, too. This must be somebody that knows the J.C. by the way. And you notice, uh, we don't see him around here no more. Since he got to haircut that, he end to him. Since he looks that good, you'll never see that trial again, no more. So, evidently, this is some fact model out there who, uh, used to get naked with Josh and look a lot. He made county six to two nine four six three six two two. W-I-O-D. Here's Portland, hello. Hey. Main or Oregon. Oregon. Oh, boy. I've glad to be the hell out of there. Yeah, I don't blame you. Congratulations, sir. Thank you. When you say, uh, living a breathing people, that leaves this place out. It's not a joke. I mean, it's for real. There aren't any old, crabby old people here. They've taken every deadhead in the universe and they've jandabullied in here. The south of southern part of this, Pini Sala. There's only one thing that's missing here. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, well, and I thought I'm on the internet, man. I'm all over the place. Can you tell me that? Can I tell you what? The website page. Yeah, all you got to do is do the real radio thing on, uh, what is it, George? George. What's the website now? Because I get confused with the old one. The, uh, are you nuts? Yeah. W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-W-O-O-D. Audio-net.com. Dot com. Anything for W-I-O-D? I think it's a good under-live radio on a talk for you talk. And we're there. All right. Hey, thank you. You'd be amazed at the response we get. Not. Hey, um, can you leave me at home and play in one little bit for me? What is that? Young meal. Oh, have a great day, pal. Okay. Leave me at home, please. Okay. I almost talked his way out of that. Leave my home for about a minute. We have two open lines in date, six to two nine, four, six, three, six, two, two, two. Boy, I'll tell you. Easter is, of course, you got to understand something. I hope you're ready for this. This is the beginning of the summer yet. You don't realize this. A lot of people think it's a beginning of the spring. Wrong. Once Easter is over, and then especially, pace off, the season's over, the party's over, baby. I see highly apart. They had 6,500 people there yesterday on a Sunday, no less. On a Sunday. Oh, my God, man. Deader than dead. Now the season's over. Now, I'm sorry, I was for making the Emerald Coast as popular as it is now. I couldn't get in there myself last night. Actually, if they knew who to hell I was, if they knew who I was when John went in there, if they knew us, they would have said, hey, well, clear a table aside for you now, Mr. Hot Shot. Here you go. You go right in there and your heart's content. If they realized I'm making a millionaires, the richest chinks in town. But do they have any ID who I am? Do I look for any special treatment there? You damn right, I do. Am I getting it? No. Am I pissed off? Yes. They should be treating me with velvet gloves and I join. I'm packing at joint. Morning, noon, and night. Every month I can don't stick. And of course, with publics decide to be very firm yesterday on Easter Sunday and closing, a lot of people, you know, they were eating out. All the Jews, all the kids were eating out there yesterday. All the real old ancient, geriatric blue hairs. Date County, 6229, 463, every line in debt is a debt is a date, date is a Dorneal. Here's plantation, hello. Why are you picking one might? Oh, God. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Hi. Yes, sir. I'm along with your Portland West Coast call. I was just out in California. I thought I told her, I heard your old Phil Hendry out there. Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations. Good for getting out of here. What's that? He's no dummy. He got there a lot of here. Yeah, he was on late at night out there, but uh... Well, he is on late at night. You need to get on out there somewhere. I mean, they have a lot of mediocre shows, but I tell you, people here don't realize what we got with you now. But their dead heads here. That's the thing. The only thing besides working for this company, that's the only thing that's a negative is the fact that these people are impossible to get through. You have to beat them over the head with a sledgehammer. I mean, out there. If you try to have an intelligent or even a goofball conversation with these people about anything, it's not just talking. It's anything. They don't know from nothing. Other than early bird dinners, that's the only thing they know about. They know nothing here. I tell you, with that stuff that went down in Rancho, I was dying to come back here just to hear your talk, she looks. I missed all that. Yeah. You missed what? There's nobody talking about it. No. There's nobody talking about that here. They think this guy's name is Apple Sauce. They don't know who the hell he is. Yeah. Well, good luck in it. Thanks. I need a pal. Thanks a lot. What about asking the question for 100 years? It'll never change. Never change. Don't get all worked up about it, especially on a Monday. Just relax. How that you're finally getting your health back. Now that you're mouth and you're tongue and your ears and your nose, that the pieces of your head are finally starting to fall back into place again. Don't get all worked up about these bastards. That bitch that calls before, giving me a lecture because she don't like what I have to say about the team who knows nothing about it. But now she's an expert because she went to a couple of games. So now she knows everything and how dare I say all of this and that's that or even though it is true, of course. They can't handle the truth, okay? It's just like the religion bull crap. They can't handle. They can't cope with the fact that they've been lied to all of their lives and they've been so stupid that they never just took five minutes to sit down and think to themselves, is this possible? All these bubble micees? Is there any logic? Is there any sense to it? Oh, there's no logic. You have to have faith. Yeah, that's what Ralph Reed says. You have to have faith to be as much of a bigoted little prick as he is. That's what you have to do. You have to have faith. And now I see speaking of bigoted little prick. They put the f*** you cannon. He ain't got nothing to run for. Now he's back on CNN. And by the way, how come David Halberstam gets an all kind of trouble because he said something that I thought was like much to do about nothing about Tom Jefferson and the slaves. He gets into a big jackpot. Ted Turner, he says the other day that it's great that I agree with them by the way, but he comes out and he says that it's great that these people often themselves. They didn't run into McDonald's and shoot anybody else. They killed themselves. So we got rid of 39 assholes. And I go and Ted, nobody got pissed off about that. I don't see anybody saying Ted Turner ought to get fired. Of course he's the boss so we can't get fired. I don't see anybody getting all bent out of shape about it. Screaming. Ha? That was an irrational thing. Oh. So in other words, if Tom Jefferson had white slaves who would have been all right, is that what you're saying? Or if he had crazy slaves. You can insult crazy people. How do you know they weren't crazy? After you go out there and pick all that cotton man in that hot summer sun, trust me. You wind up in plantation. We have a broad lines wide open here. This is brutal to the man. If this is the best you guys can do, I'm a heavened at music on it. We're playing Gacy, the rest of the day. We're going to play disco all day long until this audience finally gets with it. 7679, 463, 3 open lines and brought. We got people killing themselves out there in the name of religion. We got people killing each other. Let's hear about the Middle East peace talks. Talk about an oxy moron. Every day we got another story about people killing kids, killing each other. The Jews and the Arabs and the Arabs and the Jews. And then the Orthodox Jews here are hawk and a China. Unless you eat the right kind of humontation, you're not quite a real Jew. And they're eating the little a cookie ones. They're eating the little triangle cookie ones. And they think they know something about being a real Jew. They know nothing about it. And it just goes on and on. And these people here, man, they got nothing to say because they don't want to be bothered with the truth and reality because it's a two annoying. It's two annoying. They don't want to be annoyed. 622, Wiod in date, 767, Wiod in Brown. We got the one guy on the level there. He's on hold. So we got like basically nothing going on here today as usual on a Monday. Why does anybody like I said congratulations to Ron and Fizz and Bill and whatever their names are for taking off this morning. Maybe that's going to be their new format. Every Monday, all tape Monday. What? They took this morning off because they didn't take Friday off. So they're taking their Easter holiday tape. Well, what did they take Friday off? Did we take Friday off? Did he even get a Rick Riley? Riley, take Friday off? No. The other company people did. Yeah. So I guess they felt they weren't titled. Oh my god, it got. Like I said, good choice guys. 1114 at Wiod if you. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1113. 1114. 1113. 1113. When you're brave, her doctor has been says it's okay. A sensation gives his name. My forces up, down, my head spinning all around and round. How this lesson for three days now. Whoa! Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! Ben, Ben, your attorney's only been. Ben, your attorney's only been. Ben, whoa! What a pussy. Okay, it's 11.18 at WIOT. We have two open lines in day, six, two, two, 140, open lines in Broward. 65,225 open lines on the upper lines and 52,684,000 open lines. So the guy in 11, we blew him off finally. Thank you. Or he'll finally hung up and found a life out there in Portland. Probably. Here's Bointon Beach on a mobile. Hello. Yes. I thought my battery was going to die on you. Yeah. I just want to let you know that some real people up here in Palm Beach County who got some balls in 85 years old who like Blizzard's. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you're absolutely right about every line being open. I called on four different lines. And everything was right. Well, what was the point of that? Are you a line checker now, is that it? No, I was just, you know, sometimes I think not you, but some radio stations. I'm going to tell you something. When I tell you, because I'm the one I tell you how many there are in date, how many brown. To give the audience an idea of how, you know, what's going on here? I don't sit here and make things up. This is not contrived radio. That's you got the wrong station for that. Oh, I know. It's right. We don't sit here and say if you move quickly, you might get in here when we got every line open. You know, like certain people that try to psych out the audience. Right. I don't think you're a psych out the audience kind of guy. You're just straight up. I'm just a straight guy, right? You're straight up guy. Yeah. You keep going and screw up my taxes. Okay. All right. You first. Okay. We have an open line on the purple line at some mobile one in the out of town line. Or whatever it is, the mobile line at Pond IOD. And we have two in Broward 7679463 767WIOD. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, you know how you doing? Okay. Listen, did you see that movie yet, Donnie Rask? No, I did not. Oh, save yourself, man. I had to walk out of it. I think it was sleep. Well, it rings. Yeah, Adam Adam said it was very weak. Very weak. Oh, oh. What are you doing? There's it. What do you think? Yeah, Pondris. And just talk. Yeah. Pop, pop, pop, pop. Yeah. I heard you talking about it. Do you think I'm like, I got a save on from that. Yeah. Now that it's another godfather wannabe. And everybody's running out there to see that. And the meantime, they should be going to see the godfather and only 95 year old blue hairs are going. I don't understand that. I don't know. It goes to show you that this so called generation X lacks, they don't go to anything unless it's hyped sufficiently. If it has the proper hype, you can manipulate them to go to whatever you want. But unless you're hyped it, right, they just can't be bothered with it. Well, what I don't understand is why won't they put the second movie, which is the better movie to me. You know, right? No way. Oh, yeah. No way. No way. You don't think so? Godfather, two is better than Uno. Yeah. Oh, my god. I can't believe you said that you're going to purgatory now, sir. Oh, man. You're going to be there for a long time. I can want to be better. Huh? You don't like it better. No way. Godfather, one is the definitive, I mean. Oh. But number two is so much. I mean, you understand so much better where they come from and everything, you know. Yeah. I just like. Well, I mean, Godfather, three is the worst maid movie, but it's not the right minute. Wait a minute. No, it was not. It was the worst acting. It was the worst acting. But nevertheless, it had the most important story about the murder of the Pope and the Vatican Banking scandal. But you see, people don't care about the story. All they care about was the Sophie had a big nose, you know, totally know. They're not drinking canoli. Right, exactly. She made a hell of a canoli that Connie, I'll tell you. I tell you, he just flipped down, huh? Yeah. How do you like the way you did? Oh, I was beautiful. I loved it. That was the best acting that Eli Wallock didn't know home movie. It was when he choked on it. It was awesome. It was. That part was good. I loved when he said I have a stone in my shoe and the assassins said, solo una espina. I love that. I like that. That was my first Italian lesson. Solo una espina. I like the part with Apatino says that they should be afraid of a sister. Yeah, they should be afraid of you. Yeah. Notice how there was almost like a comedy routine there. I know. Now they will fear you. Yeah, right. You're going to bring that line back. Okay, bitch. Give me a break. All right, Naomi. Okay. Thanks. I'll save my, I'll save my eyesight. Okay. Thank you. So Donnie Brasco sucks is what everybody generally says, even though the lovely Johnny Depp is in it. Boy, do I need that boy? I used to like Johnny Depp when he was like an actual guy when he was on a show on Zeta, but that was nine years ago. Wayne says it sucks. Wayne said it sucks. Adam said it sucks. Everybody said Donnie Brasco bites the big one. Okay. So whatever you do, stay home. Go see the Godfather. Well, yeah, what else wrong with yous? We have a day lines. Why don't open six, two, two, another very aggravating day here on a Monday. Another very tooth pulling day six to two, W. I.O.D. Two open lines in Broward. 7, 6, 7, 9, 4, 6, 3. They don't care about Marshall Applegate. Apple sauce. They don't care about that. They don't want to deal with the fact that really, and you see the mainstream media are presenting this like, well, they are all just very nice people. They just happen to be led down to Garden Path and Yadiyadiyaya. But this has nothing to do with religion, of course. Right. In fact, this morning on that CBS morning abortion with the five minutes of local cut-in that we wind up, they show about two minutes of the network here of the hour. And the rest of the time is like local cut-ins with the guy with the suspenders. And then, of course, Mark McEwen comes on and the other guy that owes ADS, blow our shorts and you thank the Lord that they're only giving you two minutes an hour of that. And they're going out about there's over two, how many of these say 2,000 in the middle of these cults in America today and over a thousand of them have to do with flying saucers? Which brings us back to another great scene in the Godfather when Carlo went nuts and he was throwing all the saucers in everything. Talking about flying. So remember that? She's throwing all the silverware. She's throwing the dishes. Go ahead, you're getting basted. Go ahead, you spoiled, getting brat. Flying cups and sauce. Right. Flying cups. How do you like that? I got a cup of fatigue just from watching that scene. Dave County, last call for calls in Dave 622Wild. This is useless. This is Miami for you, man. This is this town. Hopeless and lifeless. That is a Dorneal. And now that Easter is gone, you might as well just roll up between now and the what? You're going to be sober between now and Christmas and Khanica forget about it. It's all done. Here's Fairfax Virginia, hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Have you heard Bill Henry lately? Can't hear you, sir. Hello. Can't hear you. You got either a bad phone or you got to like buried somewhere. You got to the Arkile Sok on it. Bill Henry. Yeah. Hello. Hello. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Oh my God, do you believe this? Let's just leave this guy until 2 o'clock in the 90s. Here, easy.

Here's Delray on a mobile. Hello. Hey, Neil, that guy must be on top of a pole. I can green acres out there in Virginia. Sounds like it to me. How are you doing? All right. Hey, you got a thanker for the Akins here, but on his about eight, eight months, he lost 26 pounds. Oh, are you still looking like Luke O'Broad Sea, you know? Yeah. But I'm doing a lot better with it. Excellent. Yeah, it's really helped me out. Godfather 1, definitely the better movie. I can't believe, I mean, that guy was doing so well until he got to that point. Yeah. Try to tell me that 2 was better than 1. Yeah, the wife and I are going to go see it probably this weekend. Yeah, it's like to see it on the big screen again. Yeah, bring back the whole army off. Yeah, but I don't go see it. I want people to go see it who've never seen it before. What's the point? Yeah. I've never seen the video eight million times already. I know, it should be. Yeah, the music is just so beautiful on that. You know, if you got the good stereo in the house or crank it up, that's just gorgeous, you know? Yeah. It really is there. Oh. Oh. There's makes my heart cry, Neil. Hey, I got one for you. Whatever happened to a boom from science doll. Whatever happened to him? Yeah, I've got a bad mistake. He moved up to Lake Worth with all the dead people and I think, uh, out of business. Yeah, I got one. There are a couple years ago. A bad mistake of all that. He was in a bad location in Broward. So he goes up to Lake Worth and I try to tell him the median agent Lake Worth is 195. Yeah, when I'm a song twice up there, you know, and uh, boy, he was something else. Yeah, I always had a picture of you in the wall. Yeah, he was he was a great guy, but uh, horrendous bad business man, bad business man, great family, great guy, bad business man. Yeah, a nice guy though. Well, I'm not a material, Neil. Okay, pal. But uh, thanks for your music there. Okay, have a great life. Whatever you say, we have an open line in the mobile one line, the purple line, the pound line, pick it up and pound it. Pound IOD, we pay for it. Two on the out of town lines, including Fairfax Virginia, but don't call me back, please. And one triple eight four seven four nine four six three one triple eight four seven four. How's that market doing? Make it a big comeback. Oh, thank God. Thank the Lord. God can't be bothered with all these people that are off in themselves. And these stupid cuffs, cause he's too busy trying to keep, take care of that delicate balance, which is the world economy. That's all God cares about. Let me first you like the rest of us. That's right. His money money money money. Forget about all this other bull crap. Don't let that Ralph Reed tell you that he cares about anything besides money. It's roll at money and all those for a business. Goi, I'm there. The so-called religious right, who ain't neither. Now down 92.15 the Dow, big recovery cover was down 130 moments ago. I thought we were going to like have to run out of here screaming naked in the streets today. So don't panic, okay. Just relax.

And when they're going to serious the reason that they got castrated here is because they eliminate all of that. That's right, get rid of the sex. And now all of a sudden we're pure and wonderful and it's great in boring. Really boring. And by the way, he didn't have cancer. Oh, damn it.

I need a lot of, I'm gonna wait to keep weft and you're waking up on 1111, my markup. Sorry about that. But I agree with you with Ted Turner. Yeah. I just wanted to ask him, listening to you all along. How come Ted Turner who's like a big hot shot, says something that's very true, but nobody gets upset about it. Nobody got all bent out of shape and called for his ass. Why is that? He can do anything he wants to do. He's the last week. He told his company to do whatever he can do whatever he wants. Of course. Good for him. Good for him. All we started was kind of illiterate but not a bad guy. Exactly. I'm listening to a lot when I'm out here. Excellent. Normally from Palm Beach, but one thing I'm Swedish and I want to, I want to watch those pandas. But if I can, yeah. One thing I don't understand is why they shoot when they have one month man more. I mean, when they, you know, I mean, this is, hey, listen, the last seven power plays. They got seven goals, of course, five for the other team. That's good. Five short hand. Yeah. It's so easy to do. It's just make a box and there's one more left. They don't know how to make a box. That's the problem. If you ever talked to Eddie Jovenoski, you understand, is I cute like that good? You don't know how to make a box. Okay. I said, Eddie, it was a box when he sees one. Okay, pal. Max Andean is God. Thanks. See ya. And boy assuming he too bad either. We're bringing boy assuming back for the leaves and Bill Hewitt. I don't care what that John Shannon says from the CBC. And by the way, no, I still don't have my tapes. Oh, brother. I'm sorry. I think we're going to take John Shannon from the CBC and Michael Mayow, Mosquevitz from the Sun Sentinel and make a match made in heaven. God, all mighty talk about bull crap artists to pop up. Give you a song and a dance. Here's a lady in Davy. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. I was at the game on Saturday night. It was so boring. It was way boring. And we had a good seat where we could see Beezer's face. Yeah. He was mad. He was jumping up and down. He screamed and left and right. Probably taking an absolute part to that game. But if you would have been there, I guarantee you would have had a great time. Why? I was sitting between Dave and 2014 and Jose from the pizza loft. No. Yes. Oh, no. Yeah. We brought him to see you. He was talking about nudity and everything. Jose was there. Yep. Oh, my God. If I would have only not known it. He was looking fine. He had a tight black shirt on. A smell real good. And he smelled real good. What did you look at your head under his armpit on? He felt melt. He felt melt. But they, uh, he went down to see you. God, I'm not going to be pressed. First they wouldn't let him in. Yeah. They thought they just wouldn't let him in. I'm going to straighten. You know, they're very nice those, uh, usheres are very nice and they come over before the game. And always ask me the same question to many times, which is the first 500 times should, you know, let them know. And I'd tell them if people want to come over before the game or between pures, I don't mind that. And especially Dave and Jose and, uh, and, uh, and, uh, what's his name Jacob? Yeah. What is wrong with those guys? There are two, but he doesn't count. No. He's that big hairy guy that Dave brought down there. Yeah. We show whatever you say. But anyway, we, we, we, we, so Jose was there and you were there. You were squeezed right in between Dave and Jose, huh? That's right. And you went home with your husband, poor baby. Yeah, well. You're always dream. Yeah. But anyway, we got into a game and you weren't there. Damn it. I don't know what to tell you. I'm turning the clock back now. Thanks for the bad news. All right. Have a great day. Oh, how deep pressing. How deep pressing. I'm there at almost every stinking game. Come on, Dave and two, four, team, get with it. We have an open line in date, 629463, a parent, Broward 767 Wild. The out of town of worldwide web, the Palm Beach lines. One trip, a late 4, 7, 4, 9, 4, 6, 3. So like she said, what the hell would there be to talk about that game? One nothing, Tampa on a short handed goal by the lovely Rob Sam and her early in the game. Tommy fits cereal ties it up with a minute, 25 to go in regulation. And they wind up with a one-one tie against a very mediocre team. In a snoozer, snoozer rhymes with loser and cruiser and booser. Oh, and if guy up in 124, they're the rat man. I'm telling you, we're going to get his ass. We're going to get the rat man before the season before the playoff start. We're going to straighten his ugly ass out. Here's Fort Lauderdale on a mobile. Hello. Yeah, I'm doing the deal. Okay, sir. I want to thank you first of all for turning me on through the Atkins thing. Three pounds, two months. How great. Sounded in two months. That's outstanding. No, there's one question. I know you're still doing it, but I know you're still doing it. Yeah, who said I'm still doing it? I'm still doing it. I'm just big as a house. I'm just big as a stadium. But are you still doing the Atkins thing? Yeah, right. Are you? No, I'm not. Oh, you're not. Oh, why? Because I fell off the wagon. Okay, question. Yeah. I can't get the strips to get dark. What do I mean? I can look at a car about high-grade and I can't get the damn strips to get dark. I can't get dark. I ask you a question. Absolutely. You're losing weight. You're feeling great. You're doing good. Oh, forget about the strips. Okay. I'm just going to tell you about it. Well, I've kind of tapered off the line. I'm not losing much weight. Lean on, and I'm really being good, man. 32 pounds in two months in your fetching. Well, I was pretty big. I was 248. Just keep doing it. Just keep doing what you're doing. Okay. You're obviously doing it right. Hey, listen. You got a great show. The only way to improve it. But I realize why you got to do it. You got to take all these stupid sports calls. You got to feel material for four hours. So I understand that. But like you say, nobody knows the damn thing. And when you're going to start talking sports, and I'm a reasonably intelligent person. I don't know what the hell's going on. But I know you got to do it. Meaning what? Well, I don't know. It's just wish you could feel it with something else other than talk about sports. When you run, you know, get people like me to run on a maturation. So I shouldn't talk about sports? No, no, no. It's a true case. It's a percentage of why. How much, how much have I talked about sports today? I mentioned, I mentioned that. I missed a game the other night. And this woman just called. And the only sports he was talking about was having her head stuck under Jose's armpit, which is a good sport to me. What's wrong with that? What's wrong with that? I'm not in general. Okay, pal. Have a great day. Get a new phone. Oh, that's it. Yep. Okay, we have two open lines in bright. I love those cell phones. Man, I love them. They're my favorite. 767, 9463, 767, WIOD.

All right. You are God. Yes. You're God. Yes. And my wife is going on the street. I can call because she hates you like boys. Why would she explain that to me? What is it with the humorless women? What is her problem? She's from Jacksonville, South Carolina. So she's a redneck is at it. Exactly. That's big. First of all, I live in the candle and my cable was out for the first two pairs of the hockey game. Yeah, I think I was lucky. Probably sounds like it from these reports I'm getting. They can't give me reports about the highlights because they weren't any. Exactly. Except for the one goal, that was nice. But of course you knew that they were going to tie it. You did? I think. You know, it's not losing. Yeah. Well, anyway, this and I have a few questions. You play two cards. You used to that are quite interesting. One with the guy. I think one of them is and the other one is those are the ones. Those are great. But this one actually says the guy who says you were once a feast. Yeah. What's that all about? Who was that? This was some jackass who was making a speech at one of these right to life things. What are these anti-abortion fanatics? And he was everybody who was for abortion was at one time themselves at feast. And that's enclosed all of you out there. You're one for feasting. Yeah. So we thank you Mr. President and now in a will be served. Yeah. What do you expect from us right to life thanks to zero I'm saying? That's great. It's beautiful.

And about the fact that there were not only in 124, but now was 204 to 05, 205. Another bunch of assholes up there in that section who are starting the same thing. See, the monkey seem monkey do it because they don't understand what's going on. So if somebody else starts something that they think knows something like the rat man, all these assholes start doing the same thing. And they're all mocking at the end. And until a minute and a half left of the game, Darren Pup has got a shoutout going through the Tampa. And there are Pup! They're mocking him and he's playing a great game. See, they just... they don't get it. They're just doing under... they's zigg when they're supposed to zag. And they zigg palpy when they're supposed to... you know what I'm saying? They don't get it. They don't understand it. And nothing I do where say is going to change that. Here's a lady in Vointin' Beach. Hello. Hey, be real. Yes, man. Oh, I had to get that.

Too bad the audience has said you're a bunch of deadheads. You know what? I'm having the time of my life. And these people are like, they're all waiting to drink the cool aid. You put us all in the good news. What time do we pass the pudding out is what they're waiting for? The ones that love you.

Okay, sweetheart. Bye. Bye bye. My now. Too open lines of day. 6, 2, 2, 2, W, I, O, D, one at Broward. 7, 6, 7, 7, W, I, O, D, two on a green lines of Palm Beach lines. The other town lines. I'm, I'm doing it. I'm on top of the world. I'm singing a song. I'm rolling along. I was here this morning with my check. Which he was so, uh, she was so far tumult this morning. She hands me a paycheck. I opened it up and she's wandering down the hall. I look at it. And it was like, uh, Adam, not Adam, uh, our Adam. Like, what other Adam do we have working here, by the way, in the building? Not here. Somebody I never heard of. So, wasn't even for an Adam in this building? Right. How do you like that? And it was like for about $1.75. I said, hey, Wendy, Ron, check. As I followed it on the hall, tackled it right there in the middle of the kitchen and said, Give me the right checks, we'd art. Okay, here you go. But other than that, I mean, what the hell, what more could you want? What could you possibly want more than that? Here's a mobile in Pompano. Hello. I got mixed emotions about the spectators. I call them instead of fans over there in the, Chronic. Chronic. Chronic. Chronic. Chronic. I can't get a ticket for nothing. Yeah. No, you didn't really have to pay for it. It's pretty hard to get a ticket for nothing. I don't mind paying for it. I like what my name is thinking. What do you think I press fans for nothing? Yeah, right. What you got on this board and he is. When you got these guys in the only spectators that go there, it's incredible. That's why they start with the poop bottle. But they have no idea what it's like to be a fan of anything. Right. But at least they're consistent. At least they're consistent. Yeah, you're right there. J.B. Brown. He was one of the best. What are we going to do without him? Okay. Get out of here. Two open lines in day six two two Wild. Two and Brad. We're going to be doing music from noon to two ladies in gentlemen. Welcome to our new Wild format. Walter Wall. We're doing it. So tonight we got Brooke from six to nine. I think tonight's like the official last week was just a warm-up. The night and midnight we got Kathy. Okay. Karen. Karen. Karen. With passion clones. Now tonight is she going to talk about something different. She's doing Walter Sabo. Please do it, Karen, because everybody tells me you're a wonderful person and they love you profusely and they're pulling for you and praying for you, etc. and so on. So we want you to do a bang up. I mean, a real solid fantastic great job for else. So that's tonight nine to midnight. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I was one of my favorites to take on tonight's game with the ping with the net. What does that mean? My take on the game. What does that mean? Well, what you think about it and the fact that we'll be planning against our former teammates, William, and two Barnes. Yeah. And I was just wondering in your opinion, do you think we should rather you'd rather see the ping with you in the first round of the Rangers? Now that Yagres back out on all, they played a pretty good game on Saturday. All of a sudden with him back he had two assists and Mario had two assists and they're it's hard to figure them. It's really hard to figure them out. Okay. I also wanted to go. But I still say I'd rather play them because they got no defense. We might actually be able to score some goals on him. Whereas if Richter gets hot with those Rangers, look out. You know, I sound agree with the German. I just called before you know, you know, it's hard enough to get a ticket right here, especially with all these people who jump on the band wearing whatever they win. But you know, leave some tickets for the real fans for those who support the team when they won't. They lose on the way all the paraphernalia. Right. That's his spectators. Amen. All right. And back to you. All right. Well, let's get somebody's phone is out of there that don't even know what they're going on. Just to stand there and have everybody see that there there. You know what I'm saying? Like the silver fox. There's a good example. Just stand there and is anybody looking at me? You're looking my big ring. I'm very impressive. Here's my silver hair. And I'm a real hot shot. I'm a very important guy. And I got passes to the to the big team box there. Whatever it is. Who cares? Nobody cares. We didn't come there to see you. They're all there looking. It's like the old luck I said before. The women with the main coach that used to come in Toronto and Montreal and sitting the first three or four in the luxury seats. Oh, look here. I am. Here I am. I don't know what's going on. But I'm here with my main coach. Same thing. Let's get some main coach for somebody's guys. Dave County. Okay.

Yeah, no matter what was going on on the ice if we were if there was scoring chance No matter what was going on there Yeah, there's holes morons I understand it. I don't and the guy up to like you said up to the point of minute 25 left He was pitching a shut up right he was pitching it Probably pitching a fit but I swear I use one of your lines in the in the stadium when I got really His ball everybody started back enough It was like when we had three consecutive shots right at him right that point blank Yeah, I like I said man these guys could score Kathy Willa's house right now and it was drumming They had good chance Yeah, they had good chances to get that bucket man They just couldn't stick it in it couldn't they could not stick it in I couldn't believe it And I hear the rumor that Eddie got benched a Saturday night.

And even when you do that it's like tinny Boy, there is something really uh f-dupped up in this joint today. Hey, but it's a technical thing don't get started on that The tip off on the technical prowess around this joint is that Ron and Ron were on tape this morning And about half of the especially when they had the guest on on the phone it was like the whole gang was like We're seeing him roll out the barrel As we can barely understand what the hell was going on two open lines in day six two two nine four six three six two two W-I-O-D our pull question today is is there anybody alive in his town of wait doing putting in the apple sauce Two open lines in Broward 767 W-I-O-D Here's Kendall.

Oh, and yesterday we're driving over to Emerald Coast Which unfortunately was aligned from here to you. You was lobbya But at any rate, there's this old old bunch of Canadians in a jucanoo Quebec plate in a big big Cadillac. I mean a big ugly brown jucanoo going about two miles an hour And I can't get around this ass. Well, here I am in my beautiful 1996 purple corvette and I'm following this old older than Mithuysla And finally he makes the left turn and thank goodness. He was going you know that seafood you don't know where it is They got a seafood joint too, which must be a real jury at your place The Florida seafood something around the right in the same place with Emerald Coast So at any rate, he's gonna make the turn into that plaza and he gets about halfway in there He gets this big jucanoo his halfway in there My ass is still sticking out on the street and now he stops because somebody is like a coming across, you know He's got all the room in the world that just make a little move around them and let me get my ass off the street and I lean on the horn And now he gives me a tuted back Give me a little tuted back You miserable old frog go back where you came from and thank the Lord.

Sonny uniform wายen Z Zagu If I was bak petsin And fathers Oh, they longed be the medieval. If I was the begs and going, I'd buy up all the stations. Like the life of Lovin Zeta, I am the anild. Don't be frustrated. I've heard loads of money in the bank. A knowing once I go in like right, I'd have a radio network that nobody carries, but everyone has thought on the spots. TV cable, real estate, I vote home. I'd have a half a dozen big ep stations and 607 AM stations too. Oh, and that's Justin Hall and Delo Lovin. If I was the begs and, we're the leather, you're the leather. All day long, I'd fiddle with my number. If I was my begs and going, I'd be a angel for man. Together, together, together, together, together, together. I've had shackles, you know what I mean. I'd be richer than the freakin' queen. When high Zango would be turning cream, if I was that begs and going. I'd be a 48W IOD, a pair of open lines and brawler. We're not too happy about that. I'm gonna tell you right now, 767-9463. 767-W IOD, if the one thing you take away from the show today is the knowledge that Walter Sabo is the anti-Christ. It'll have been well worth my effort coming in here this morning, okay? Don't ever forget it. Walt Sabo is the anti-Christ. Here's Pompato B, Chilo. How's going? Great. I hear you talking about some guy, a rat man or something? Yeah, asshole. Is that the same guy? That's the guy that was wearing a rat suit and they play off last year. I hear somebody yelling from up in the upper deck. That's him. That's him. Other side of the arena. Yeah. And then I hear everybody say, you suck. Right. That's right. Hey, ref, you suck. They're all a bunch of sheep that's rat man and sheep over there at 124. What's the story with that? What's the story with what? They're a bunch of idiots. They don't understand the game. Even if we come in a flagrant penalty, okay? And they call up penalty on us. Hey, ref, you suck. Or if one of our guys, you know, if the other team comes up with a great body check and just belts one of our guys with a clean hit. Hey, ref, you suck. The whole game is it's like holding up a big sign saying, we haven't got any idea what's going on out there. We don't understand the game we're dumb, but we're loud. We're dumb, but we're loud. From section 220, where I said, I can hear that guy. Yeah. I first only heard you sucked. And now I can hear him. Somebody screaming. I couldn't tell exactly where we've come up with.

Let's not go into these playoffs on a real downbeat note. Let's score maybe more than one goal would be nice against the team with no defense. Everybody's kicking ass right now except Broward. Broward is in a deep blue funk. Okay. They're all searching for that. We're going to see if we can get a good team.

He wasn't living with the other broad. And it just really said thing. To sad story that they just keep trying all these fags man. They just keep trying desperately to put over on the public. And it just isn't working. It's not working. Maybe Tom Cruise. That's an exception. I didn't say Tom Cruise was a fact. I didn't say it. I may have hinted it. I didn't say Troy Eggman. Who cares? Okay. Let him go do each other. Whatever they're doing. Mind your own business. Get a life. Who cares what they're doing. Who cares if Ellen's a degenerate. Who cares about that boring sick ass stupid show. Okay. Ever seen Ellen with Randy Rhodes? I don't mean like nine in that way. Open line and braward 7679463. How's old Randy doing by the way? She's still up there. I thought she'd be long out of there. That's what she was saying. That's what she was saying for a long time. She's getting out of that dump up there. That's what I heard. Here's Miami. Hello. Right. Yes, ma'am. Neil. Yes. It's like. It's what? Yes sir. It's Mike. Okay. Those people that yell that stuff like soup and all. I think they're pathetic. They are. Right.

That's Mike. We have an open line of day at 62294636222WioD. So what about that new 97 vet? Neil, if you made up your mind, that no I have not. I'm glad you asked, but I haven't made up my mind yet. I'm still, you know, feeling it. And the car too. I'm still examining and exploring it. Isn't that the way it is when you got a new play toy? You got to examine it, explore it, find it, feel it, squeeze it, dittle around with it. And then you decide, hey, this is not too bad or it's okay or maybe it's great. It looks great. It looks really neat. Everybody gets a lot of looks. I now I got a new deal. I'm driving to work this morning in my new Corvette. Now I got these people that kind of like look out of the side. You don't want to say they don't want to look directly. You know they're staring at the car, but when you turn in you look at them because you know that they're eyeballing your car. Then although they kind of like, oh, that wasn't really looking okay. Especially if they're driving like a red Mustang GT, like one guy was this morning and believe me, I saw your drive it out here on Shuren Street when I turned the corner. No wonder you're driving a Mustang, okay. You couldn't drive your finger up your recto. That's why you're driving a Mustang, you loser. God, a red Mustang actually look pretty good. Yeah, the new Mustang, I got to be honest with you, not that I would ever want one, but you must think people that got a new Mustang, the new real sharp look and what they don't look too bad for like a little kitty car. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. Hey, Neil, this is Robert, a hydroponic broder from Alvin, so far. And I'm a huge fan. That was good, wasn't it? That was a good call. No kitty, can you tell me about the life of Sponning? I think when you spoke too much, it makes your voice cool up like Mickey Mouse. No shoot, right? Anyways. Yeah. Oh great. Yeah. I'll give her a ticket, will you? Right. I'm running a red light. Give that bitch a ticket right now. She almost crashed right into a cop. Come on, Porkey. Give that bitch a ticket now. Or at least get her number, yeah. I guess he was going to the donut shop. Probably. Yeah, didn't pull her. Probably, Runchles, yes. Anyways, he closed. I just wanna call my mother on our douchebag. Okay. She believes that crap with the world's Emary on the bank building. Oh my god. And I get to the point, I just say, okay, you believe what you want. I believe what I want. I go, how about the cinnamon roll, too? Well, that could happen to our gold guys. That's right. I didn't get into it because I wanted to get late last night. I put my wife off. By your mother-in-law? I'm alive. Okay. I don't know if I would've got into it, where there I would've not gotten any so far. You wouldn't have gotten into it right. Okay, pal. Good luck there. Congratulations. Oh god, that's good. Okay. Two open lines in date, six, two, two, two, W-Y-O-D. Why the hell can't the Virgin Mary show up on a cinnamon on a cinnamon on a cinnamon? Oh, man. Isn't that what you say when you eat a cinnamon? Oh, god, that's good. That's right. I don't think I ever had a cinnamon, but I smelt him. You know how in all the airports they have, and like in Vegas and the Vegas airport. You remember? They have the cinnamon on his, that's the only thing I hate about Vegas is the airport. Oh, I mean, it's not a bad airport, but it's just a walk. No matter what gate you come in on, the slept from the gate to the, to get out of there. It's like 100 miles. 100 miles. And of course, you got a pass 4,000 crappy slot machines out of way out of there. But god, is that a long slept to get out of that McKeirin International Airport. You're just dying to get in your reddit car or on the limo or the bus or whatever and get to the casino and start losing right away. But man, it is the longest slept. And then you got to walk by that cinnamon and the aroma of that, oh god, is that stuff smelled good? Man. And you can hear people like they're practically swooning in there. So you know that they're seeing the virgin Mary on the bun. They're seeing her buns on the roll. They're saying, oh god. The roast are doing it in the back room. One of the other. At cinnamon, boy, that's good stuff. We should have them, don't bring any over here, please. It's not on the Atkins, baby. Not even on a Skatkins that's cinnamon, but are you just smelling it is good enough for me. And that's what I told the Josh Moro, just smelling it's okay for me. 1258 at W.Y. a day told J.C. that a couple of weeks who asked why we don't see him no more. Hey, if you want to sniff out a great bank, here's family bank. If at my buddy Matt was there on Friday morning when I deposited a certain check George on Friday morning and he was there like real early he had to clock in the drive through like naked. I'm not naked, but I mean, didn't have a suit in the tie-on. And I said, hey Matt, you're looking pretty good this morning. He kept taking more clothes off and more. I don't know if he'll do it for you, but he kind of enjoys when I go through there. You know, especially when I put enough money can make the pay roll. You're going to love family bank. They're like members of your family. That's why I ought to be called family bank and it is. CAUTION. A Delta Linkling Sick Worth. 610 W.I.O.D. Miami Fort Launderede.

Big article, Republic's Yellow Break Road in Business Sunday. Big song of the dance about Republican history is a Wayne did this. And Wayne did that. Wayne's going to do this. And that's it. And it doesn't say a damn thing. It doesn't tell me whether the cell is stuck, whether it's going up to 500. Whether it's going to go down to 10. Doesn't say anything. How's the market doing, by the way. I don't want you to panic, okay? You're a DSS. 275 is the new location for CNBC. All are good at it. It's not even down 100. 96.31. And then as Dex down 20, which that's like about 100 points, it's not too good. Not too good. Today would be a real good day to sell. Get on a phone with your broker and Haka Machinic. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Hello, Doctor. Yes? Any other going? Great. Listen, I just got back for the best. The best. Huh? I just got back from the New York area. Yeah. Watch my elders a kick from the outside of the air. Eight to two, eight to two, what a thrashing. Zigman Palfi gets the hat trick just in the second period no less. More three in the second. Right. The best thing. Do I know what's going on or do I know what's going on, Mr. I got my thumb on it. Listen, the best thing you could have been to that team was for a military group and I wanted to take over the team there. That's right. But Tuesday is. And you know something they're not out of it? No. We're only one point behind it. I don't believe it. Well, there is the I have never seen anything like this. There's like 150 teams vying for the last three spots. Yeah. In the east. Yeah. We got a shot up. And then I went over to the middlelands and I caught the third game. Yeah. Which was kind of nice to see Billy Gurr. I had a pretty good game. Right. Good player. I like Billy Gurr and Hello Player. Yeah. I think the devil can somehow squeeze the pass fully. And we can squeeze the H-border. I think we've got a shot. And how about St. Louis knocking off Philly last night? I saw that game. They beat him three to two. That was a hell of a game. Yes. It was. Grant Fierre actually played some damn game last night. He was unbelievable. Yeah. I didn't. Didn't watch. He made a save off Lindros and last couple of months of that game. Would show you had to see it to believe it. Yeah. Hey. We caught the. The replay of the. If you're game, Saturday, you name when we got back in the game. Don't say your game. Huh? There game. Yeah. Let's try. Don't blame me for that. I had nothing to do with that. That was. That was pathetic. Coma. How many of these coma games we're going to keep playing now, man? I don't know. You guys are offensive. We got to get it going tonight. That's right. Got to stick some in there against the team that has no defense. Not a bad defense. No defense. We better score about five or six tonight. Or I'm going to want answers in the morning. Hey. You think we're going to be pumped up for this game tonight? I hope it gets five. All right. Deal. Have a great day, pal. Yeah. In closing. I have a request. Yes. Can I have the David Vala go over time goal gets to pass? Pretty please. Who? Oh, where the hell am I going to find that? Come on, Neil. I'll look for it. David Vola, at least pronounce it right. Do you think there's any chance I'm going to find that? George. Little kill some good time looking. Oh my god. Where the hell? I know I got it. I must have threw it out. You know something. I'm pretty pissed off about all those cars that we threw out. When Roy was holding a gun to our head, I don't know more cars. You've been to give it all those cars. You got a month to give it to the cars. That was another part of the ass. The ass holding of WIOD was right. Pressmen in here, telling us that we had a certain like the time that we had to get rid of the carts. Talk about an interpret act that was totally unacceptable and grow test. I can't find it right now. This guy's requested hockey calls for like three years ago for quite a lot by the grow test, a Chris Cuthbert of CBC. And what's going on with this? What's going on with this? We had these bastards going again. And now. We're going to be a real problem. Check it out, check it out. No, even I can't listen to bad. Check it out, check it out. You know, I'm going to tell you something. And I want I'm going to say it. If you get pissed off too bad, I have a real problem. Not with black people because black people are like any of these good black people. There's bad black people like white, like anybody else. But with black culture in America, I got a real serious, serious problem with black culture. Many black still call that black culture. You realize what? The normal people don't consider that to be black culture and are offended by it. What? 3T? All that 3T? Check it out, check it out. But that's like 10 steps above rap music. That's like about 10 steps on a food chain above rap crap. It's just slow, small T rap. Check it out. Oh, I guess this is not only 3T, it's featuring Prince Cuthbert. Oh, my God. Is it literate as they want to be? When are you going to stop with the illiterate bull crap already? Check it out. I can't stand it. I have a problem with it. Please help me. We have an open line in date. 6222Wild. We have a parent-brower. 7679. 463. We have an unimobile line. We have a real flurry there. Even Calgary never had a flurry like that. Then the guy called here started talking hockey. They all disappeared. We have a real flurry. We have a real flurry there. Even Calgary never had a flurry like that. Then the guy called here started talking hockey. They all disappeared. I think that's it. No more hockey talk man. These people. They not only don't they know anything about it. They don't want to hear it because they don't understand it. Even if they like it or they think they like it, they don't get it. They wouldn't know Zigman, Palfi from the Zigfield Follies. These people. They're cool as insurers. And by the way, saw Schultell at that game last week. Which game was that? That was that awful Ottawa game, eh? Where we lost three to nothing but we made it look like three to two. It was really the final score but it was really three nothing. Could have been five nothing. It was really pathetic again. Another comment performance. That's why they don't care because we're playing pretty crappy these days. That's why they don't care. Cooper City. Hello. Yellow. Yes sir. Yo dog, what's up, G? K. No, I have to change a piece on here but I was going to ask about the Marla. What is it? I hope it's going to ask you about the Marla. I'm not into fishing. Not at all. You're going to get out to watch anything. I might. Norm Kent called me before he's got tickets for opening date and tomorrow four o'clock against the cubs. What do you think? Do you think I should go? Absolutely. I don't think so. You can sit up there by your buddy Harry. Are you going to be in town? Yes sir. No, I don't know. I don't think Harry's making any of the road trips this year. None. And if he's not there, it's not even worth going. It's right. He's going to get up there in the cemetery and sitting for it. But he doesn't do that. No, not out of town. He doesn't do it. He did that one time and some people got pent out of shape. Why? He's the best. He is. You're right. You're right. I'm a cubsan. I know but bad. But I trust you, Arthur. Right. Well, I guess I answered my next question. I was going to see if you were going to have more of the show while he's in town. But I guess if you have a town that's going to be hard to do. Not really. It was a frost my asshole little girl. Yeah. He's up there having himself a good time. Anyway, my next question. He's only going to be going to Florence, Italy in May. Really? And I was going to ask you how the weather is in May. It'll be a decent. It'll be a, you know, it'd be okay. It'll be in the probably 65 to 75 range. No kidding. Yeah. It'll be like spring. You want it to be. Because it'll be spring. Perfect. It'll be nice. It'll be if you ever been there. No, never. Oh, man. Are you in for a real, sir? You'd never been to Europe. Never been to Europe. Oh, my God, you better strap yourself in tight. You'll find out what the real world's all about. Trust me. Okay. I want to full report. How long are you going for it? I'm going for two and a half weeks. All in Florence? Well, no. I mean, I want to go around. From there, but that's where we're going to be centrally. What were else you going? Um, basically anywhere we need to go. A Roma. I'll go. I'm sure we'll go. I'm sure. And probably, let's see if you're going to be. Probably want to check out Bolonia. I'm going to check out wherever they take me. And maybe Vanice, Venice. Venice? Take your hip boots. What's the best place in the going, Italy? The best place? The best place. Rome. Rome. The best place to be. Like, no much take about. Florence is beautiful. It's great. Uh, well, I mean, I haven't been all these other places, but Rome, you will love Rome. You'll just, you will kiss the ground. You'll kiss the earth. Yeah. So you haven't been there in the pizza loft. The food, that little bit. Yeah. Have a great time, pal. Alright. There's a lucky camp right there. He's going to Rome. He's going to Florence. He's going to Sicilia. Palermo. He's going to a scolidia. Pacheno. Yeah. That's right. A scolidia. He's going to Tadino. He might even sneak across the upstairs, the Switzerland, the Schwarz, the Schwarz. Two open lines on the green lines there. Whatever those lines are, Broward 767-463-767-WI-O-D on a great Monday. God is it a good day. I'm going to tell you something. I get out of bed in the morning now, and I say, every day is a good day. I can't imagine why. But I'm thinking at myself. 610 WI-O-T. Stand major, huh? Okay. One 16 at WI-D. So it was just tell me amazing, stand major stories. I think the only person around here more amazing than stand major is. You're what? That's me. We have an open line in day. 622-WI-O-D. We have two-and-Broward 767-463. In fact, I'm just dealing around not looking for some music to play, because we only got two or three calls on a board. I know we're never going to make it until two without music. I just know what I can feel it. Open line on a mobile, purple one mobile one line. Whatever the hell out is, pound I-O-D. Two-and-Broward 767-WI-D. Two-and-Broward 9-2-2. We had a call. Where was it from? From. And he wasn't even listening on the internet. Portland. Portland, Oregon. Yes, thank you. So, my thought you said parkland. Here's a picture. Remember the guy called about the event that the guy backed over the Corvette? Here's a picture of it. It says, if you think you had a rough day, last week this brand new Corvette owner was in Pembroke Pines to pick up some of John the Baker's great food. When he came out, he couldn't believe his eyes. A mercury stable was actually parked on top of his beautiful car, which as you can see had temporary plates. Oh my, they just got this car. Brand new! Do you know what I would do? Seriously, no questions asked. Oh my god, it says the food at John the Baker is so good. People seem to be willing to park any place to be the first to tell you about, etc. In the Flamingo Pines' pleasant-extra Home Depot. And his jacket is backed up over the top of this beautiful brand new Corvette that still had the dealer plates on it. Yeah, we had a call about it. They've seen it. They were there when it happened. Talk about absolutely unacceptable grotesque life-ending of behavior. That's it. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Great. Great. And we can all right? The best. I've brought you the yoga last week. Oh thank you so much, by the way. I think it may have helped a little bit. I've been here. It's very slow, but I'm getting there. I'm glad to hear it. I think I can't recall you the last week, but did you see who Luis McGill was with at the Oscars? Somebody called, but it slips my mind. Yeah, the girl that was in the Sparado. Some bitch. Last name Haydich. There's some left to go to news. I think it was Greg Fedic. Cheyenne is used to be in Manudo. Oh Cheyenne, I know who that is. Yeah, you're saying Cheyenne, you're saying Aurora. Oh, he was doing that Cheyenne. He was doing that like Chinese. Cheyenne. Exactly. So yeah, they were in Manudo together. Cheyenne's okay. Yeah. Yeah. I just got called. He ain't no here. No Flavio sees her. I'll tell you that. Nobody is. Flavio sees her and his brother biggest dickest man. Look out for them. Have a great day. I'm sorry. See, he's slays me. Two open lines in date. Six to two nine four six three. In fact, Flavio sees her on some. Holy Osopopra. Every afternoon for those of you who speak real. Professional Spick's out there. They're watching 23 and or 51. He's on some soap. And they said that he's having a hard time hanging out with. 767. 463. 767. Well, it is kind of a Roman name. You know, Flavio. He looks Roman. He looks like he's Roman all over the place. I wonder if he knows Luis real well. Here's a lady in Miramar. Hello. Lady in Miramar. Neil. Yes, ma'am. Hi. Is Christy Hawaii? How are you doing? Good. Neil. I hear that. They're going to take you off the radio. No, they're not. What's going on? What's going on with what? I keep hearing this thing that. Who tells you that they're taking me off the radio. Who told you that? Who told you that? I'm asking you the question. Where? My friends. Well, your friends don't know what they're asked from their elbow. They don't. They don't know. They're Adam's apple from their thing. I wanted to let you know that my husband listens to you all day. Yes. And he's always writing around. Right. And I have all my girls here and they want to scream something out to you. Okay. We're ready. One, two, three. One, two, three. One, two, three. I'm here. I'm here. I'm here. All right. I need to take care of you. I'm not going nowhere. I'm not going nowhere. Okay. Great. See you. They're taking me off the air. Not you or any other damn stupid thing will take me off the air. Remember Howard Beal? And they said. So anyway, we have, well, he had that thing with birds. Remember said I have this relationship with nature and birds and so on? 6, 2, 2, 9, 4, 6, 3, and day. And we got nothing in day. We got not one call. There's two million people in Dave County. There's over too many people. Not everyone came in on a rubber raft. And we don't have one of them on the phone right now. That to me indicates that a, there's nobody is listening, which I know is not the case. Or b, there are a bunch of deadheads, which I know is the case. Or see there are two busy on a Monday for us, which is also the case. 6, 2, 2, W, I, O, D. You better get with it right now, man. Are you going to have tapes up the ass? Open line on the purple line. That's the mobile one purple line at pound I, O, D. Where's my good friend, Jacob, for crying out loud? Come on, Jacob. Where are you hiding it? Here's Weston. Hello. Hey, good morning. How you doing? Good evening. Well, what happened was you and you moved up to Hollywood, all the day people fell off. They did? I, I imagine. I don't think so. That was a fourth possibility. Okay. I'm, I'm really annoyed, Neil. What do you annoyed about, sir? State police, sir. Yeah. They sucked there. It's gone. You mean the FHP pigs? That is correct. Fort highway pigs, yeah. That's right. They have nothing better to do. There's no reason for them to be in existence. You to understand that because we've already discovered that if we need people to write speeding tickets and other those stupid tickets, we got more than enough to go around to write those. So there's no reason for us to have the Florida highway pigs. Well, you know, if you're broken down, they're not going to do anything for you. That's right. They don't even stop. They don't even stop. They just laugh as they go by with their big 10 gallon Texas hat on. As a matter of fact, when I tried calling you Friday afternoon on my way home at 130 in the afternoon, I paced a floor to pig FHP number 1778. Yeah. And this scumbag. Du Spag. Slime ball. Yeah. He was doing quarter than the speed limit up 75. Yeah. I followed him from where I got on the palm metal all the way up to when he got off at Sheridan Street. Yeah. And all this jerk off did was crawl up people. That's his tailgated. He made people panic and kept the flow of traffic. He came to Sheridan Street and crawled up people's asses, huh? That's right. Okay. So his speed was nowhere less than at least 73 miles an hour. And at times he topped over 80. Right, com. So I just reporting that I lost my case. I know Randy and his folks did the best they could. You lost a case with the ticket defense team. I never heard of that. I did. But that's a rarity. I know it is. Wow. Well, what happened was I was on my way to work in the morning. Yeah. It was a day before Thanksgiving. You know they got that construction. Yeah. All right. You know that the pigs can now pace you. They don't need radar. They can do something that they write on the ticket. They can tell you anything they want. They've always been able to do that. Well, I wasn't aware of that. Sure. They can say whatever they want. Basically these guys. Yeah. And I got it, man. You should have mentioned my name. You should have told them an uncle. Leo. You still be on the inside. Maybe on the inside. Look it out. But yeah. Okay. Don't do it again, pal. All right, pal. Okay. Broward County wide open now. We find a good date straight. Now it's an out-broward goes into a big deep blue. Funking. We're not too sure why. But we think we have a pretty good answer. 767, 463, 767, WOD. I'm in a hallway here talking to a fat boy before. How about that panter game Saturday? And he goes like that. He said, where's the food? If you take a weekend off and you miss a home game and it turns out to be a really bad, bad, grow test, disgusting game. Even if Delta does suck the big one, you think, hey, that was a pretty good choice I made. Nice going Neil. Thank you so much. All I can say is, Oh God. Exactly. Here's a mobile in candle. Hello. Mobile in candle. Let's go through radio away up real loud. Oh, sorry. I need help. That's okay. How's it going? Great. Listen, I just wanted to tell you first I'm calling a long time listener. Excellent. I've been for years. I paid all this crap that I'm here. You're going to stay on. I spent the last year and a half in Kentucky suffering with the draw in like the fetal position. But I let you go. All right. Okay. All right. There you go. Okay. Just blew him a big one and it cares too. We have an open line of day. 6 2 2 9 4 6 3. Okay. Look at Broward. Broward's having a problem. I wonder when. 7 6 7 Wild. Welcome to my car. I think tomorrow we're playing all oldies by request. Okay. And if we don't have what you want, we'll just play what I want. Oh. Holy in the hand. What? Okay. No job. Who did this? Oh Johnny. Oh sorry. I know can't live where I'd will it. Work hard. He got a cool little tick. Came rock in there. King and walk and stroke. What do I hate this? Do I hate this particular brain? Oh. Here's that my one. So anyway, look at that Broward thing there. Look at this Broward problem man. 7 6 7 9 4 6 3 7 6 7. This has been one of the most excruciating Mondays. I can recall in recent memory. This has been hard. It has been brutally hard. I can't even put it in the words. It is so hard. God like a rock like a brick. Just like a brick. Like a lot of those shots that were thrown up in the NCAAs. By the way, he's a little tip for all new betters out there. Wildcat's going to win the NCAA championship. I'll ride. And thank God that Arizona. Thank God they didn't blow that game in the end. They gave it a damn good shot. I'm so sick and North Carolina and Dean Smith. I mean he's a great coach in the yada yada. He's been there 100 years already. Go away, Dean. Go find a life. Go play Majong. Go retire already. He's been a coach there for 100 years already. Go away. And Arizona, how bad can they be with a coach who plays the skin loot? He's got white hair. He's a sweet. He's a sweet this guy, the coach of Arizona. And they actually got a couple of white guys on their team, but they sit on the sideline of course. And they've got three black guys who are very, very light-complexed. Who I think might be related to three T. Why is that when you think it's just a coincidence? There are zone where we recruit black guys, but they can't be like over certain degree of darkness. Because there's all those real bigots out there in Arizona, all those John birds types out there. We'll support your baseball team as long as you don't got no darkies that are like two dark over a scale of three on a Richter scale. So like I said, three team might play for them pretty soon. Broward County, we're waiting on you. I'm going to put this microphone down. I'm going to walk around the room and wait. I want to see an explosion in Broward, likes of which has never been seen. Everybody else is a smoking. 7679463 767W IOD. Our poll question today is, how do you like Ron and Ron? How do you like Rick and SUDS? How do you like the new Vitch at nighttime?

Yeah, let me say it again, in case you missed it earlier. Michael Mayo writes a big column this morning about 10 is 10 is about a pansy sport. About Tomas Fuster, most of what I'm going to tell you guys is, and still refuses to apologize. Michael Mayo, I'm going to talk about this every day on his show. For the rest of my life, I'm going to mention this until you write the apology that you promised. You promised right here. We got it on tape. If we have to dig the tape out. Okay. If I have to dig that tape out and play it every day. You made a pledge to retract that line about trying to get David Halberstam fire just because you ran my time at the time. Because your grandma's name was Mosquevitz or whatever it is, you better get with it, Michael. We're going to start getting pissed off. And when we get pissed off, we might actually start buying the Harold, but I doubt it. 128 to WIOD. 610 WIOD. These are the hearty stations of the American family Federation.

It's on there every morning with his radio show. Yeah. And it's just sitting around. Cron is bored. It's in everybody bastards. He looks at the desk. You never. I read a thing about the last week of the week before he was under a forgot the fact that he was on the on camera and he was like blurt not every four letter. Warden here in the thing. He just like, cue and gun looking at it. Looking at his desk. The whole show. That's what I like to wake up in the morning is watch. Don't I miss who lose a funny guy. But it looks like a dead man. I'm going. Hey, I never have seen the see a see. I see. Can't contact you about putting your show on. Are you kidding me? Come on. For what? For the world. I don't chew gum, pal. We have an open line on the out of town line. One triple A, four seven four nine four six three. One triple A, four seven four W. I. O. D on a great Monday. Every day's a great day here at Paxon Inc. Here's a mobile in North Miami Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. Good. Good. This is a me. I've been listening to you quite a while. I hear a lot of talk about the tickets and your your colors and you talking about how unfair a lot of this is. I'm sure. Wait a minute. I want to hear what is. Well, that people are receiving traffic tickets. You know, and. You know, you stay keep in mind that are you a cop. I'm sorry. Are you a cop? I'm not a cop. I'm not coming here. I'm piloting. Not for Delta. I hope not for Delta. No, not for Delta from America. Thank God. You know, you've got people. You got 50, almost 50,000, 40,000 people a year. Dying on the Americas. I waste. You know, look at that number. Look at the numbers and cram. And you've got it. And that's because of speed. Is that what you're saying? Well, no, it's for a lot of causes. Yeah. I mean, let me ask you this question. When's the last time you saw one of these old 90 year old drivers who should never have a driver's license? Once the last time you saw one of them pulled over for going too slow or impeding traffic. When's the last time? Well, you're right. I'm not never saw it. Never saw it in my life. I lived here. I lived here for 21 years. I've never seen it once. Well, it's you're right. It should be tell we should have a system in place where these elderly drivers are. They have to be periodically tested when they reach a certain age. But they've got so much. We're talking about people in their 90s. We're talking about people in their mid 80s and 90s. Where getting me noodles by mail for six years. I don't have any problem with that. You wonder why people are getting killed on the highway out there? People deserve to get tickets because they're going because they're going 10 miles over the speed limit. Accidents and their cars and people to get killed. Let me say this to you. If you're going 10 miles over the speed limit, 11 o'clock at night on a road where there's absolutely no other traffic in either direction. I've got to take it for that. I routinely go 10 miles over the speed limit. Right by cops and I have never received a ticket for that. That's not the kind of ticket I'm talking about. Those tickets are written every day. Every day. A little bit of the number of people that are running red lights in this town. How about the people that are driving around Stona? How about the people that are driving around Stona? They're in his town. Well, that's true, too. There we go. The point is, is what is the point? Who deserve to get tickets? Very often. And some people don't deserve it. It's certainly nothing to do with some dough. And sometimes it's just as well. You know, I mean, you know, look at the media attention. We have an airplane crashes and God knows any any airplane It crashes and the kill somebody is a tragic event. Yeah. It hasn't been seven or seven or eight thousand people or less have been killed in the entire history of aviation. Yeah. We have 40,000 people per year. That's right. Because you also got a lot of dough. You got a lot of dumb people out there driving too. You realize that, don't you? Of course. And the dumb are you are the more dangerous you are. Well, that's very much. I say, let's get everybody off the road or step you and me. How's that? Well, I don't think that's going to work. And you start on day now listening. I'll stay in Broward. There's folks that definitely need to be thick of it and you can't always blame the cops. Right. Not always. Just most of the time. All right. Okay. I'll see you next time. I'll see you in those friendly skies. All right. Okay. We have an open line. Not Delta. No more Delta for me. Open line and Broward 7679463. Two open lines in the green lines. The Palm Beach lines.

Hello. Hey. Neil. Great. What's going on? Not much. I got a question about that comment. You just may. We're about to honey Browsco. You don't like that movie.

Didn't you see that in the paper today? I was a familiar with that. Guy from UM was one of the cult members who drank the stuff and ate the pudding and the apple so us and the vata story and then turns out the guy didn't have cancer after all. But he didn't have cancer. He didn't have cancer. He's over there anyways. Huh? A bunch of liberal fruity bastards over there anyway. Where? You, UM. Liberal? There's liberal people at UM? Yeah, sure. Well, if you find one, let us know. I will. I'll search one out for you. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. The guy's name was David Cabot von Sender in his 48 and he's one of the guys that come and then off himself. He drank the crap. So you think he was influenced by the hurricane? I think he was because he was a hirku. Yeah, that's enough to be enough to make me blow my brains out. Uh, come on. Okay. One more thing. Yeah. I got this dog over here. Yeah. There's a little puppy. Yeah. You know how to dog by what he called it? How's break him? Yes, I do. What should I do? Do you want the real answer? Yeah. You're going to laugh. You're not going to do it. You go to the drug store. Yeah. You get some infants depositories. Oh, see? I know you're going to laugh. Okay. You don't want to have him do this works. The great it's instant. It's immediate within days that dog will never do it in the house again. Infants depositors. The little support. Don't get how what kind of a dog is it? The other tree.

You take him outside immediately. And with an amount of moments that pressure there on his. Reck him. We'll cause him to do the number outside. And then he'll realize that when you go outside. That's where you do your thing. I'm telling you, I know but he wants to believe me. It's the sureest way to house break a dog. You're a victim at the person. Okay. Or a matchstick will do. Okay. Good luck to him. And don't forget it's up to dogs as. Okay. We have an open line a day. I can just see this guy's going to be sticking matchsticks up his. Reck him or suppose it to race.

To find out about them. If you can buy them for below things value, these guys are going to take the ticket away from you. Yeah. The guy who sells them to you just kind of like just wanders off. Yeah. And you know, officer friendly there takes tickets. The ticket is fine. It gives you a few exposures and on to the next corner. He passes them off to Mr. Joe scalper. That's interesting because they do confiscate the tickets. You're right. Oh, they confiscate it. And they also save you got any other ones there. And of course, if you're stupid enough to say, yes, and you give it to them, you're making them some big bucks. I'll take everything you've got and clean your short rack.

Always wanted to be somebody else. Brad Pitt in seven was desperately trying to be Marlon. Everybody wants to be Marlon Brando. Which is only one Marlon Brando. And this is which why do you want to be Marlon Brando anyway? That damn fact that I can't stand him. God, he must wait like 700 pounds, not us any? In fact, he's so big they were going to make Godfather four five and six all at the same time with Marlon doing all the roles. Eat and all the roles. Poor Marlon man, they had to kill him off in the first movie. Don Koyong. I am Marlon and grateful that you have invited me to your daughter's wedding. Exactly. One fifty seven of W.Y.D. Do yourself a favor and go see by the way, February's like Donny Brasco. There's one vote from our movie review crowd.
