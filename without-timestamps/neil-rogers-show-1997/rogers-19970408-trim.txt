I am a positive, the feds he's done for a drive, that's 610 WIOD Miami Ford Lonerdale. 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers Show, to talk with you all, call 622 WIOD and date, 767 WIOD and Broward, Mobile 1 and 18 team wireless customers can call toll free at pound IOD, and now not only across the nation and Canada to call toll free at 1 888-474 WIOD and now the Neil Rogers Show. The next day, the Neil Rogers Show, to talk with you all, a ride with high-zinga such an asshole, I like the Neil that managed that creature, because he would take a shower with a headgovert, a asshole, asshole, you turk. He's a high-zinga such an asshole, he's just like Hitler and a Abarron, what's that he's pounding on? He's a high-zinga such an asshole, he's just like a thief, just like a thief, just like a thief, new format, what do you laugh at about I think it would be get about an 80-year easy, it's 1002 WIOD happy Tuesday, very Jackson and Ellie Brecker of just a low-pate run off together, nobody can fight them, get a live guys, put it up crap, I like the way we need don't return her calls, they just make it up numbers, they throw all kinds of numbers in there about, from your mouth to God's ears, Ellie about that phone is okay, I know somebody who knows somebody else at that bank, anybody makes up stories like these so close to pace off, you know it's going to go to purgatory forever, and probably have to buy a lot of expensive moths at too. No, I'm not going to return your calls, Ellie Brecker because last time I talked to you and you wrote that big long-sung advance, the Miami-Herald, like, bought you it all up and twisted the story, and by the way, I just found out that the arrow is spending a lot of money advertising on the station, and the deal is that none of the spots can go in this show, which is a lot more incentive for me to talk to the people, yeah, it's true, true story. It's been in thousands of dollars advertising that rag on his station, but very specifically none of the spots are to run in that show. And then he'll ride your show, even though our whole paper today is devoted to that fat slob. I mean, the whole paper must be something going on, huh? But far-bisoned Jew over there that BB Netanyahu, he was on her yesterday with President Day, all the, yeah, peace, they're going to have peace, all right, a piece of this, a piece of that piece of my mind, they're wailing at the wall, the Arabs, the Jews, they're doing it. There must be something else going on besides the arrogance is going to, you know, where? Huh? There's got to be something else. See, Eleanor Brecker and the Barry Jackson evidently are bored. I mean, really bored. Of course, if you listen to the most of the radio in this town, you'd be bored too. But they're really bored. And so their thing now is they're going to stir the pot. Then maybe later on, somebody also smoke it, certainly not them. But they're going to stir it. They're going to pick out the seeds, the twigs, etc. And then they're going to get it already for somebody to smoke. Maybe buddy, but who knows? So anyway, about that meeting I had, you know, I wanted to retract something. I said, I yesterday said something really awful. I said that I've had diarrhea for an hour and a half that was more productive than the hour and a half meeting I had with Bud Paxon. I want to retract that by, and I want to replace it by saying, I've had diarrhea all day that was more enjoyable. In fact, I've had diarrhea for two days at a time in my life. That was more enjoyable and much more productive than the hour and a half meeting I had with Bud Paxon three weeks ago. Do you think that's soft in the blow there, any? Huh? It was kind of soft. But at any rate, sooner or later, just stick with it. So anyway, all these stories, then of course, very, we got Ellie Brecker calling. It's going to be a favor. What do you please, Ellie Brecker? It's just quick calling Harry Peanus up there in Orlando. I don't need any more phone calls from this guy. It's killing me. Oh, well, what does he want from me? What does this man want from me? I'm sitting there yesterday, minding my own business, having just watched a gut wrenching episode of the guiding light. And it's like 405 in the afternoon. The stock market is closed. I'm looking at the market at a good day, but Wayne Stock went in the crap or again for a change down seven eight to again. Nice going, Wayne. Your stock blows. Get a haircut and get something going with that stock. And the phone rings. I knew Harry and it's Harry Peanus again from Orlando with that same syrupy sound. I mean, you know, never stole a freight train, but what do you want at this point? And it seems that Ellie Brecker from the Harold calls him up again, trying to stir the pot stir up a big controversy here. Really whip everybody up into a frenzy, which you can see by the phone here. Nobody cares because nobody has audience reads the Harold anyway. But yeah, well, understand you were talking about me this morning. And Ellie, you know, she wanted to get a quote. She tried like crazy to get me to say something nasty about you, which I wouldn't do. So this is this is the idea of news at the Harold. It's call up this one and try to get them to say something nasty about Neil, then call up the other station, try to get them to say nasty, and try to create some kind of a war going on over here, okay? I mean, I don't really care so long as the paychecks keep coming. You know, it's it's very a material at this point of my life. But I mean, talk about desperate and talk about fabricating so-called news. And so I finished reading this so long thing here in the living section. Neil Rogers talking, taking show to QAM, top rated talker signs five million dollar five year deal. And where these numbers are coming from, I have no idea, especially about the bonus, sweeten by a signing bonus of nearly five hundred thousand dollars. There was a nice signing bonus, but it sure wasn't a five hundred thousand dollars. And if you use Eleanor Brecker at Barry Jackson with the facts, because they just make it up, I think it was more like five billion dollars. I'm buying your newspaper. How do you like that? And you're both fired. I mean, just keep making it up. So I figured that's astonishing enough that there's nothing else going on. And yet another article about Neil is leaving some day. We don't know when. Then I'm looking on the sports section here and here Barry Jackson again. He just can't. He can't stop. He's out of control. Rogers unlikely to let up on Hizenga at WQAM, which is why we started this morning by my favorite song. And then I look on a second page on page 90 is the article continues in the world. Will Hizenga use WQAM out clause is the headline and that part of the article. And it goes on to say about how they have an easy out with all three of their sports franchises. And if I dare to criticize them over there, will they very Jackson's speculating, well, they're going to withdraw the rights and the marlins and the panties and whoever else in the dolphins, which is absolutely untrue, which have already said that the Wayne people are not going to try to interfere. They didn't remove the dolphins from this station because of me. It was because of one thing. Money, baby. That's what it was all about. That's right. It had absolutely nothing to do with me or anything that I've ever said. But don't tell Barry Jackson that because Barry and Ellie, they're going to create. They are going to concoct some kind of a crisis here. They're going to concoct some kind of a, what will battle of the radio wars? That's what we call it years ago. The radio wars. They're going to bring that back again. Because it's boring time here, man. They have 3000 people at high LE yesterday. I see 3000 people. Woo. They're just ain't nothing going on here. The season is over with. There's charging too much for months all over town. I mean, you know that this is a really dead time when the big stories are like for the 80. I mean, it would be a big story. I guess, having been here all these years that I'm going elsewhere in a few months. But the story is old. It's going back in the last Friday. It was already confirmed here at Tuesday and their hyper ventilating and making up numbers. And the other big story, Surge and Mots of Price triggers an inquiry by the attorney general. That's the big story. That's what we ought to sink our teeth into. You can see this audience is all worked up into a frenzy by the arrow. Man, if you created a controversy here. Nothing. There is a one line even even blinking, winking, blinking or not, I guess. So. One Pommetage, your host, to work for that. One journal. Exactly. That's right. They're charging too much for Motsa and the old Jews are getting really pissed off about that. When is a pace off by the way? Do we know? Let me take a look at the, do we know George when Passover starts? Let's take a look. Oh, this is still on March. Let's get with it over here, huh? The 21st. 21st of April. And today's the 8th. So less than two weeks and a pace off starts, which brought you going out there. Passover, which is where they had the last supper. Isn't that where Yosuke was having his last supper? That's right. Paisach. I wonder if he was eating Motsa. Do you think so? And if so, was it buttered and salted? That's the question. We, we, we, we, we do know anyway, the same five pound box of Motsa that sells for $4.95 in pricey Manhattan goes for as much as 12.95 in softload of supermarkets according to Abe Asafski of coconut creek and Malaymal. Oh, how do you like that? With two weeks before Paisach beginning, state officials have decided to find out whether more goes into Florida Motsa prices than just flower and water. There's a big inquiry now, okay? This is what's going on. We don't have any crime. Everything is a hunky dory. Wayne Stock is in the toilet. This company is terrorizing people all over the radio dial. And what, what are they worried about? They're worried whether the Motsa prices are too high. Maurice Ribsteen of coconut creek, who's daughter recently brought him a five pound box. She bought it in New Jersey for just $6. I just want to make sure they don't take advantage of us. Oh, God forbid they should do that. And it goes on and on. When Dixie currently charges 1198 for a five pound box of strikes is Motsa, but supermarkets officials say they may discount their product as the holiday draws nearer. Using it as a loss leader to attract old Jews to attract customers. But that's what it says here to attract, yeah. I got a solution for you. And Maurice, I got a solution for it. Don't eat Motsa, okay. Who needs bread? Who needs bread anyway? So, and say, well, what else are you going to eat? I don't know. What are you going to eat? I don't want to eat the Jeld stuff in a jar, please. And what else do we need at the Pazza? Drixie wine? So, Manachiev, it's wine at the corner. That corner has all instructions. Detailed to come. I'm not interested in any of that barberica ancient crap, okay? And all these bubble icees. Next thing we'll be getting instructions on how to late to fill in. Which I don't think we can say on the air anymore, by the way. But it's tradition. Hey, that, yeah. So is human sacrifice. So why stop now? Exactly. So anyway, did I tell you about that bad boud of diarrhea that I had for an hour and a half? Here is Miami on a mobile. Hello. Yeah, I knew I had the power 96 by report. Power 96 by report, yes. Bogriff took the time this morning to announce the terms of your contract. Yeah. And how does she know the terms of my contracts? I'll get that of course. She's out by the hell, I guess. Uh-huh. But she went ahead and announced it to welcome you and then she proceeded to say that her contract was up in July. And that she was hoping to get something sort of like what you got. Right. Making a reference about it. And Mark Mosley was on doing some voice. Yeah. And he kept referring to you as the fat man. Also then she said that all the employees of our contract made or something like that. Yeah. So our Greg reads employees were all looking at your terms. She compared the looks on their faces to that of a blow up doll in a porno migrating. That was funny. So anyway, I just thought you like to know that. Outstanding. All right. Thanks for the good news, pal. Bye-bye. See you. Loan me $50 million. We have no, I mean, you could believe those numbers that are in there or not. And especially the thing about the bonus part, which again, you know, that's way off. But don't confuse these people with the facts. You know, it's been heard. In fact, somewhere in the one article, it says, um, it's been, it's been written, you know, it's been written like it says in the, uh, in the old testament. Oh, it's been written. Yeah. Right. By whom? Well, we don't know. But it's been written. Where the hell does that say? It's been reported in the media that his salary was in the, uh, you know, here it is. Published reports in the past have estimated a salary to be the mid six figures. Published reports. Well, what does that mean? Published by whom? Where did they get it from? Did they get it from me? No, did they get from anybody I know? No, but, uh, published reports. Therefore, it must be true. I read it in the freaking newspaper. So if you wonder, if you think that there's any degree of journalism, especially at the Miami Herald, forget it. And if they don't care, they just make it up. And if you don't talk to them, they'll even make more stuff up. And then they'll start calling around to try to create a verbal fist fight. Can't, uh, can't I get you to say, you know, something derogatory? We said all these terrible things about you, Mr. penis. He probably told her, quit calling me, Mr. penis first of all. God, I'll mighty that, Ellie. I wonder, I, they ought to charge her 30 bucks for a box of moths. I ought to be like that. I mean, Ellie, who's obsessed with this, uh, New York Japping thing. Hahaha. Whaaah! Exactly. And by the way, Randy's Brazilian. 1015 at Wiod. 610 Wiod. I'd play a king and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. If I was but Texan, y'all are real, you're real, you're real. All day long, guys, be the beautiful. Here I was that Texan going. Boy, I'd buy up all the stations. Like the life of love and Zeta, I can see an IOT. I've had lots of money in the bank. A knowing was a go-in like Roy. I'd have a radio network that nobody carries, but everyone has done on the spots. TV cable, real estate, I bought home. I'd have a half a dozen big epistations and 607 AM stations too. Let me first hear us. And that's just in hell and they're low. Roy! If I was but Texan, y'all are real, you're real. All day long, guys, be the little with my number. If I was more Texan's boy, I'd have a half a dozen big epistations. I'd have a half a dozen big epistations. I'd have shacles, you know what I mean. I'd be richer than the freakin' queen. When I thinker would be for an increem, if I was that Texan going. Roy! Hey, happy pays off, but 1020 at W.I.O.D. Happy Tuesday to all. Very, very quiet day. And time we're going to investigate the price of MOTSA. I think in fact, they would be making great payphone challenges. I think for Rick and Spud. Send Adam who naturally is Jewish. Send him out to all the stores. And you know, secretly find out the prices of MOTSA. And then start like carrying on on hyperventilating. And whip up all the old Jews into a frenzy in every supermarket in town. You're getting ripped off. Here's a lady mobile and hell and Dale. Hello. Yes, ma'am. You were leaving so I figured I was on my house. Am I, I can't hear you? You're not, do you guys pick up? Okay. Are you really leaving? Am I really leaving what? Are you going to QAM? Yes. Did I have a hearty thing you haven't been in town? And I just heard you briefly this morning. That's just wonder. Yes, I am. I wonder if I could take place. I know when they change. I don't know. In a few months. Okay. TBA, will you be listening? Yes, sir. Oh, thank God. Oh, follow you. Thank you, sweetheart. Okay. Have a great day. Bye-bye. We have an open line of day at 629463. We have two open lines in Broward 767. We have one on a purple line at poundiod on a mobile one line. We have one on the other town line. The world wide, the wicked web line. One triple eight, four seven four nine four six three. Here's what's going on with that run and run business, by the way. This big meeting is going on with that deal. Oh, you want to speak? Even as we speak, there's big meetings Ellen Mason. Who's another one of the corporate to haunt shows. He's in a building. Tommy Cramer's in a building trying to find the other three pounds of that white here. And, uh, boy, boy, just amazing. It's astonishing what's going on here. Who could have ever predicted that in just a handful of months this, a mid this, decimation would have taken place so quickly and so painfully. Here's a homestead. Hello. Neo. Yes, sir. Who are they going to get to replace you? You're asking me like, I know, like they're going to tell me or like, I would have any idea. How do I know? They're driving. Just wondering, I mean, there's the station going to help. Yeah. And. First, go ahead and read how you. Yeah. What about the dolphin? What about the dolphins in Jim Manage and Jeff DeForce and Kim Babou, Camperoon, I was nothing about hockey. By the way, quick try to talk about hockey. Kim, by her, you last night, I'm embarrassed for you. What about all those people? What's left? Do you realize that the only on the air people left after I leave here from my last September, Rick and says, nobody else, nobody else, that maybe even, you know, Steven J. Gay on a weekend and other net, nobody, nobody. Hopefully Rick and said, follow you down there. And it's like nice to be able to turn on one station in the morning. Yeah. It's kind of difficult to twist that dial all the way down to the 50 kilo cycles. It's pretty tough. Move. Yeah. Okay. Pal, thanks. Yeah. These people all, you know, it's kind of nice leaving on one spot. How about your TV? Let me ask you this. How many of you turn on your TV and leave it on one spot all day? Yeah, but who's got a remote control for their radio? Well, you better get it. As whole. God, dang. Yeah, I know the first two words I'm going to say when I go on a year over there. Okay. God is the first one and dang, eight to second one. See, I'm the reason I'm sticking to that promise because I want to go out of here whether it's like in six months or six minutes or six days or six weeks with that least having to be able to say, I lived up to my end of the bargain. Okay. So now I'm not sure if that's a little bit about the good work. I can't remember the whole thing. There was no other people I at least lived up to what I was asked to do. Unlike some other people with course kept trying to change the ground rules all the time and coming up with pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, all kind of other stories, which is all a bunch of ballooning anyway. But don't believe them. And I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, that that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that is, that I said don't say that because I didn't get my last check yet. Here's a mirror more. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I was wondering if you were trying to do you job as a volunteer. Because I called the Mayor's office here at Mermore and as you know, they're using they're going to start construction or something because they're going to start construction or something? Yeah, because these are not going to work. They're going to start construction. They're going to start construction. Yeah, because these are not going to work. They're going to work. They've been saying that they're going to do something. Eastern Mermore hasn't been touched with what? With an ugly stick? I wouldn't touch it with your thing. Well, anyway. With your fingers. Anyway, I haven't tried you to job as a volunteer. What do you mean trying to get a job as a volunteer? What does that mean? What kind of a job is that? Well, a volunteer to do what? And construction or anything, you're helping help with it. It's impossible. Yeah. So what do you sound so bummed out about? In other words, you want to be the guy that's going to put Mermore back together again? Even after all the King's horses and all the Queen's men couldn't do it. I guess. So far, man. OK, George, give this guy Humpty Dumpty's number. OK. We have two open lines in Broward, 7679, 460, we've talked about the press. This guy sounds like he's going to blow his brains out. Because he can't get a volunteer. There's people out there that want to get a paycheck. They would like some money. OK? There's people like to get a real job. Like getting a few bucks or they put food on a table. This guy's like suicidal because he can't get a volunteer job to put Eastern Miramar back together again. I'm going to tell you something, friends. Everybody all over the state is sitting on pins and needles waiting to fight out if Eastern freaking Miramar is going to get put back together again or not. Forget about the Mata. Forget about Neorodges and all the money. Forget about Ellie Brecker. Forget about Harry's penis. Forget about all this stuff. OK? The big thing is his Eastern Miramar will never be the same again he asked. And look where this box is this morning, by the way. No. Oh, God. Come in here and potchiki around. Let me ask you something. What goes on here at night now? Why is it necessary? I mean, I realize that it's a very ugly question for me to ask. But why is it necessary now that Ron and Ron got their own studio back? There is something they're still going to be here. We still have it a big meeting right now. Maybe they won't. But at any rate, why does anybody need to move this stuff out of the way here? Even if they don't use the DCS, is this like bothering somebody over here that we have to keep potchiki around and push and stuff back and forth and pushing this box over here? I think that's the problem. And we got too many people patchking around with stuff here at night. Somebody's going to get their box pushed pretty soon. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Sorry, well. We have an open line in day. It's six, two, two. She's weak. Nice person, but God is she weak. Six, two, two, nine, four, six, three. Two open line. And you know what? It is those topics. Oh, God. Now, if Neil Rogers went out and bought a Brazil that was too big, that would be a big story. It'd be on the front page of the paper again tomorrow. Ellie Brecker and very jacks will be at bird ions investigating. Neil's bra was too big. I'm telling ya, that would be a story. But because she went out and bought a bra that was too big, I mean, is that a topic for a talk show? What is with these topics? I'm telling you, call up Harry Peanus right now. Time to take those topics and drop him in Lake Okeechobee on a way down. Get rid of those boring, terminal, co-inducing topics. You want to get the audience on fire. You want to get those peaks of 20 shares. You just watched what we're doing here this morning. We got a couple of calls on there, not too many. We got a couple. We're working on a rehabilitating Easter in Miramar. We're going to put that piece of crap back together again. It's the last thing we do. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. Maltzie. I'm sorry. It was, uh, is that still in that movie theater or what? That probably not. Who knows? The same old farts that saw me for when I saw it again and the abysiliants of people out there that wouldn't know the godfather if he stuck or can only up their ass. They didn't bother going to see it. Because it didn't have the hype and you know what, Merricka Man unless you got the hype, they don't respond. Sorry. 1028 at Wild. Wild. Wild. It's not your radio. It's just real static. The work not ready to have an hour now I've been on Wild. And now, language lab, the show that teaches you a four language in less than 60 seconds. Today's lesson Greek. Listen one. Strawberry pie. Strawberry pie. Listen two. Apple pie. Apple pie. Listen three. Pumpkin pie. Pumpkin pie. The customer. What kind of pie do you have? Answer. Apple a pie. The long Betty and Pumpkin. Language lab is a public service and we not be copied or authorized for yourself. Thank you. You're welcome. 1033 at Wild and a very marginal Tuesday morning. We have an open line of day, 622. We have a parent, Broward 767. We have two on the other town lines. So you see Eleanor Brecker and Barry Jackson. Nobody cares. It's old news already. It's old news and the numbers are all wrong anyway. But hey, don't worry about the facts. Just continue making stuff up. And call Harry Peanison Orlando by the way. Get him all whipped up into a frenzy. If that's possible, which I doubt. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Neil. Yes, sir. First time caller. Okay. I wanted to give you some more information on that. Spire report on the book, Griffin. Yes. 96. Call. Uh-huh. It happened at 654 in which he stated that not only is the seller you're getting disgusting. Yeah. So he said that because power 96, I guess, is also owned by WQA. Easily. Yeah. Okay. They say that now they're going to have to put on spots to pay for your salary. And until all the listeners that, and they're going to be playing spots are how they're going to be able to play music. So if they have any complaints about that, it will be AKS Neil to give McCallon complain about that. She didn't say that. She said it. It was at 64. So if you have a report here, what's that? That's so big. S.O.V. Yeah. Okay. And then by 735, she was already saying that she changed the parking bit. And like you were to say, profate so that way she can make the money. Okay. Okay. Great clever. Very brilliant, bro. Very good. So where's we going to be working next week? And if I could call someone to do Spac. Yeah. Mario and Carrie Hurrah, you're both too specs. Okay. But if you can't play hockey like Mario, thank you so much. For more Spire reports from Power 96, they got some listeners anyway over there that miserable, bold Griffin bitch. That's fucking bitch. See, even the audience wants to start stuff up now. Okay. Everybody wants to start a big semester. I don't give a crap about that. I'm going to do it there and do my show period period. And Barry Jackson, he's all worried about this door roast care and what does man just think of what? Who cares what anybody thinks? We're all in business. This is a radio show. Barry, I hate to break the news to you. It's called making a living. And in this case, a fairly decent one, thank God. And it's also called for me getting out of here. Which I'm counting the minutes. I'm counting the seconds. And then I'll write my encyclopedia about the passion people about a corporation that is just destined to destroy everything in its path. Open line in date, 6222 at Broward 767, 20 out of town lines, 1 AAA-474, 9463. Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. All right. Yes, sir. Jim Anwich. You know what was the happiest of animals, Miami is right now? The happiest man in Miami is next to me is whom? Fat Hague. dizzy? Yeah. How do you know that? Some people will actually be listening when he gets on the air. Yeah, that would be good. Yeah. What do you say? I got a question for you. He dealt. That wasn't a knock-in-christ. More was it? Why not? You thought I have a side that. I have a question in honor of you leaving I O D. Yes? I haven't heard of you. Let me just say something. According to plan, my plan through September 30th, I'm going to be here. This is the 8th of April. I know. We're going to be saying goodbye for the next six months. It's going to be the longest. Not that I'm leaving town like Phil Henry had to do for four months, but it's going to be a long ponderous and monotonous, but what do you want? Take your bolts, but I have a little time. What a whole bit. I play the every day the last week. Get out of here. Get a life. And what does that have to do with anything anyway? What does that have to do with anything about QAM or I O D. Or anything except we're not doing Larry King Tributes today. Okay? He's not the one to just did the thing. The O Rogers God. That's right. I don't read nothing about Larry King and Ellie Brecker in the Barry Jackson's columns today. The 85 columns they got, which spills up about two thirds of the hero, which don't run around nor are spots on this show. Isn't that amazing? Talk about holding a grudge. Okay? The fact that we got more audience on this show than they're whole rest of the town put together. Forget about that. We don't care. We'll spend the hero's money. We just don't want nothing to do with that. Okay. Two open lines and browards. I mean, it could have been no money out of my pocket. I'll still be able to pay that electric bill whether they are subsidizes me or not. How do you like that? How have I managed to reach this apex of my career of my life, of my fading life without the help of the hero without their asses? Then, huh? And I see that tonight, Ritter Stock, by the way, has been downgraded. Oh, that's a bad break. Two open lines and browards, 7679, because they bought a couple of losing companies. 7679, 463, 767, W. I. Oh, D. Kennis, Moss, Macho, Wayne, or the people at night, Ritter. How about Tony, Ritter? Let's use him specifically, huh? Kennis, Moss, Macho, Wayne, Ipinga, Mickey, Erison, Tony, Ritter, buddy, bud, Paxon, or Tommy Cramer? There's a poll for you. Here's a coral spring, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. Great. Listen, I wasn't able to listen to your show yesterday. Why not? Well, I was working. Pretty weak, excuse. No, I couldn't. They don't listen to me. Listen to you. Why not? Can you tie some? They're assholes. They're probably the ones that are charging Jews 15 bucks per box of $6.00 bucks a box of moths. I think you're right. And by the way, my mother's going bananas about that kind of money for that. My own something bananas. Sliced bananas on moths is sounds pretty good. Now that you mentioned it, would maybe some strawberry jam, some nice old fashioned Jewish preserves. There you go. Oh, sure for pace off, yes, from the circle you ran. That's delicious. But listen, you know, um, that's a song with that. Yeah. Hmm. Anyway, the today show I was watching my dish yesterday, the delayed telecast. And they were in our favorite city. They went Vegas. Yeah. Yes, sir. That's our favorite city. Well, I mean, in the U.S. In your favorite city, okay. In the U.S. Okay. Yeah. Well, anyway, I just wanted to tell you that. And how does that mean? And there's got to be more to the story than that. Well, I mean, the fact that we've, that you've told me about Vegas, I've been out there and I've experienced great things out there. Yeah. I was just, uh, wanting to take off the show. No, I did not. I don't watch that show. Underpendently a death. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Have a great day, pal. And the smoke one for us. We have all the Broward lines wide open. Now 767 9463 767 W. I. Oh, D. God Almighty. It's a great day for the Irish and the Jewish and the Chinese. Love the chinacy. The Japanese say, and all of those other strange people, which there are an awful lot of them to, by the way, you notice, here's a cutlerage. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Great. First of all, congratulations. Thank you, I guess. Let me tell you, if another station wouldn't think you weren't worth it, they wouldn't have offer you the job and give you the extra cash. Uh-huh. So, you know, screw me that can't think of it. What's not to like? Huh? What's not to like? Well, I'm saying you, you feel, you feel, you're getting an increasing your salary. You know, I'll tell you one thing if they were giving me even a small decrease in the salary. So I can say it now. I wish they, they wish they would have known this before. They wouldn't have given me all the money. If they were giving me a small decrease and said, hey, we'll let you work over here. I'd still go. They would just to get out of here, just to get away from here. I mean, this place is like a major cancer on our lives. Well, you know, paint the walls. Think for now. Do you leave? I mean, make you relax a little bit. Yeah. You know, now about this mobsus. How about if I just wear a pink shirt every day? No. I have several. Yes. Well, that's your point. The mobsus. Why are they too expensive? You mean to tell me that the juice now are exploding juice with mobsibose? No. Goiama are exploiting juice. The manufacturer, the man of shivets people, if you read the hero article, the man of shivets people said that they have one wholesale price, that they sell it to everybody. And after that, the distributors and the retailers, they make up their own retail price. That's right. So it's not to manage shivets people. It's not the Yidlach that are ripping off the other juice. In this case, it's Goiama ripping off juice. Yeah. That's what is. Because I don't think that the people that are on win dixie are Jewish. I think they should completely rip. Yeah. They should complain to the rat by. They should complain to be met in Yahoo. Forget about all this peace talks. They're going to be no peace. Everybody with a brain knows that. Let's get the price of mobsidown in time for pace off. At least do something that's possible. Yeah. Probably probably my share of his people had to increase the price because he said of shortening now they had to put pork fat. You know what I mean? Yeah. That's it. That's pork. Okay, pal. Good luck to you. Oh, and have a great life. Don't eat too many beans. We have an open line in date. 62294636222Wild. And we have two open lines in Broward. 767 and two in Palm Beach on the out of town lines. Our topic today is have you bought a bra that's too big guys. And are you going to take it back? That's our topic today. Come on. Let's come up with a good topic today. Let's do topics from now on. These next six long, excruciating months. Let's come up with a topic of the day. In fact, let's call Roger Krauch. Maybe come up with a quote of the day and a topic of the day. What do you think? Let's just pick up any section of the news. Here you go. Stay to travelers. Is bullet train worth building? Our topic today. What do you think? Is the bullet train worth building? How about a bullet forever wrote this article, Angela? That's right. Don't be alarmed if you open your mailbox and find a letter informing you that your license tag was recently photographed on i95. It's just an inquiry from the Florida Department of Transportation, which is researching the travel habits of those who fly and drive between Miami or Lando and Tampa. Officials want to know if any of those travelers would climb on a proposed bullet train instead. Of course, what do you do when you get there? That's the obvious question. What would you do when you get there? Since there's such great mass transportation in Tampa in Orlando and Miami? Not. See, one thing that's a little bit difficult about building like underground subways in Florida. I mean, I don't know if you've noticed that, but when you're like one foot above sea level, it's a little difficult to build those underground subways. Unless they're all going to be gigantic tunnels like the whatever it is. Callahantonela is that what it is in Boston? What do you know? You never been there. No, they have two tunnels, but they have different names, which I find very interesting in Boston. The one tunnel is like the Sumner tunnel going north, I think. And then coming back into the city from like north of the city from the airport is the Calahantonela, which why is that? Why is that just like the one one name and it happens to be going both ways? Sorry, that's too easy. 1043 a WIOD. 610 WIOD. What? We have a WIOD. You can tell your 6-fat. 8-F. We have no white-talk religion, because he is a pirate, and he is not what we have to buy thinking. Tonight, get ready for a show that'll have the critics talking. God, check out that feed-o. He does spill it out nicely. Oh, God. Just think it. Oh, God, if he started to drown. Oh, and I'd like to give him out from out. Oh, God, I'd like to save him. And look at his blood. Mm-hmm. Oh, God. Look at the torso. You watch. Tonight. I turned my radio on the other day and cut down from the program, whatever it was. It is a still-feet thing I've ever heard in my life. If the children were around, it's horrifying. I'm surprised. If the duty you let that go on the air, I've heard other complaints about it, even from the health care. I wish I'd rectify that and do something about it. I need you. I'm taking guard's name and vain and it's gratifying women. Well, I hope what you need to mention. Thank you very much. I like it. I like it. 1049 at WIOD. We have an open line of day at 6-2-2-9-463. A lot of uptight old farts here. Now, they're really going to be pissed off because the moths are like, ah, it's just insane. It's just ridiculous. How can you afford to go eat at the air-mold coast and go hopping all that for those 3rd and 4th and 5th and 6th helping's off the buffet if you... How can you afford that if you've got to pay 1295 for a stinkin' five pound box of moths, huh? I like how I said before who the hell needs moths? It tastes like cardboard. I'm not sure if you slather it with butter and a lot of salt to get your blood pressure way up. And maybe some strawberry preserves sounds really good. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Neo. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. You know, I hope this doesn't draw an out till September. This is long goodbye. Because I think that killed the last four months and they'll show... Yeah, but Phil was leading the market. I know that's what I'm saying. You're not. That's right. There's nothing to say. There's nothing to say. And he's people that keep writing these articles day after day after day. Filling up the Miami, Harold is if there's nothing else in the world going on and trying to stir up a bunch of controversy where there isn't really any that exist. It's pathetic and embarrassing. But it sure kills him good time. That's right. You're going to... Or would you talk about the bullet train? You're going to speak when I tell you this, but I finally saw the gun father. Yeah. And reason being is that I grew up in a highly religious home where the movies were a no-no. But however, now the church has this thinking that, well, the movies were bad, but you can see videos at home. Uh-huh. Yeah. It's a beautiful double standard. I mean, I walked away from that insanity many, many years ago. But it was great. I mean, it was incredible. I could... you know, and the thing is that I had... I hear you all the time. So I hear all the parts that you were playing. Right. And I would see like that guy, um... The producer. What he said he... he can't be made to look ridiculous. That was. Yes. I never knew what that was problem when I heard it. I knew exactly where it was from. It was great. I mean, um... And a man in my position can't afford to be made to look ridiculous. Oh, it was great. Right. I know that. They told me that part 2 is really good too. It is. Uh, that something we would say that it's better to part 1. I would not say that, but it's great. Does it go farther back? Yes. Is it farther back in the family? Yeah. Well, when does he part... The best way to do it is to get the video where it's all in chronological order with parts 1, 2, and 3 in a row. Right. So on a day when you're like really bored, you got about 15 hours when it's pouring down right outside. You just sit down and get about a 25 pack and then enjoy it. I can't sit for that long. No way. Hey, you knew I just wanted to mention something. It was funny. You were just mentioning that, you know, you're trying to make a living. And, uh... And you know, you're making good money. And then you see the word, thank God. And it's really funny how you just pluck that in. And, uh, you really don't believe it, God. But yeah, you thank him. So, man, a speech about thanking anybody. It's an expression. What do you mean it's an expression? Just like when you say God, dang it. It's just an expression. Does that make anything to you with any God? Just an expression of sentiment. That's all. So, if you say, I'll chip peek you. It doesn't have anything to do with, uh, I'll chip or peek you. It's just an expression. Okay. You feel good about that? About what? About saying that? Do I feel good about it? Yeah. It's just part of speech. What does that mean do I feel good about it? Do you feel good about whatever you just said? Yeah. What, based on what? What is there to feel good or bad about? Or have it a conversation? I know you are. Yeah. But I just want to try to inject it. See, one minute, you're telling me that you've gotten away from this brainwashing and his God bull crap. And now you're giving me a lecture on the use of the word God. No, I'm not giving you a lecture. I just think it's comical. Why? Everybody says that. It's just a manner of speech. It doesn't have anything to do with anything. Thank God. I would have to thank the Lord. I'll say thank the Lord. It's just being sarcastic. That's all. Okay. Okay. By the way, I didn't say I got away from the God concept. I just got a little confused. Please get, you know, I mean, you made a, first good step. Now take another little step. You know, pretty soon you'll be walking. Have a great day, pal. And God bless you. God bless you, my child. Oh, thank God. That's that coming. Thank God. But that that calls over. How does he know which God you're talking about? Well, that's the point. That's the whole point. It's just it's a word. All these God people that can't even begin to tell you what it is or he is or she is. Everybody's God stuff. Enough with the God bull crap. We're already. Well, yeah. What an insult to the whole concept of there being a God that there could be a God responsible for this. Even for this place, just look what we go through here the last six months. There could be a God and we could go through this. All my goodness. Open line in day six to two nine four six three six two two two WOD and one in Broward seven six seven nine four six three. Here's Miami on a mobile. Hello. Okay, sir. I'm trying to be Tuesday. Who's it you? I'm wondering where that guy was headed. He was being on a nice day. Oh, man. The Godfather is there. And then Danny comes up with this. Yeah, does it make you feel good to say that? What does that mean? Does it make me feel good to say it? No, it does not. I don't understand. I mean, if I want to feel good instantly, I'll just take a pill now. I mean, who needs to say thank God? Maybe that's the real thing. And then if you take the pill and you say the good God, that's good. Maybe that's a good topic for the day God. Right. Now let's stay away from that. Anyways, what I really want. But packs in one of the other. What I really don't know. God dang, one we want to speak about. What I really call about me was the heat. Inditored against. Think of them. And the piston's also. You know, they got a W last night. Yeah. So who cares? Well, I'm. Yeah. I mean, don't feel bad, but nobody cares. I mean, I'm happy to hear that. That's wonderful. And everybody waiting for the playoffs to get excited. What's going on? They're not going to get excited. Don't you get it? I mean, you're little slow on the uptake. They don't care. I don't know. I don't get it. It's not a sports town. They don't care. And everybody's all worked up because we played six games with the Marlins. And we've had great crowds. And everybody is pretending to be real enthused. We'll see. I'm reserving judgment because we're obviously not going to win five out of every six. We're going to have some rough spots there ahead. And who knows what's going to happen with this team? Well, the football draft's coming up. Anyway, there you go. Football draft. Now we're talking. Now there's something that can be seen as teeth and do. There we can really get focus. One more thing, Neil. Neil. Yeah, I'm here. Okay. I just want to. I just hope you weren't going to hang up. No, you're supposed to say, Yeah. Good. Yeah. But do you feel good when you say that? I feel real good. Okay. What about you got? I feel. I can't. Yes. We can have Pittsburgh. You know, you have these lines of, you know, Francis Lemue and Yager. That's the most potent line in the NHL is that correct? They're pretty potent to me. Does that mean Tom Cruise can play with them? That's right. I have a request. I don't know if Tom wants to play with them. What is it? Can it not be his type? Can I get, can I request something to please? What? What? What? You may be in Tom Cruise. You've been gotten it. I thank you very much. Neil, you have a great take. I'm not going over there down to the aisle. Thanks a lot. God bless you. And that's a bad other thing. Well, they had the thing with breakout. They got a chance here. Here comes six on the right side. They could get any of this right across and down. He's, wait, he's got a man open here and five. He's standing. Stove on. Sales, we're going. And the penguins laid.

I saw the, uh, some of the flyer game. I saw some of the Hartford game. Wow. Wow. Was that a game Hartford and Buffalo as Jeff Sanderson scores two goals in the third period Hartford wins and that was really something. I was watching the range again. Which game are you talking about? The range again. They had a commercial drawing. Couldn't you just smell an F game though? The range has just got on fire and they scored those, uh, they scored like three goals and about five seconds there was just unbelievable. Yeah. I was rooting for so many, bud. Well, anybody. But you had to like the cheap shot that Lundra us took. It's old fee there at the end of the game. That was good when the game was over and he like whack them right in the head and all Samuel St. just lay there on the ice. I was given a standing salute. I loved it. I love it too. But they had a commercial that's too, uh, withdrawing. I still have the commercial was about except that they were throwing Canadian on the ice. Like we were throwing a rat. Yeah. They just started throwing Canadians as flopping around the ice. Yeah. I love it. I also saw part of that game too much. I'll beat the islanders to the one. I get down to this part of the season.

And then Chris Wells get that bonehead spearing penalty. And a game is conduct, which takes that one slot on the, which he shouldn't have been in a lineup anyway. But it takes that slot on a lineup and just vacates it. And now what have we got? We got Kirk Monter at Deadman out there. What is the, what's the story? I mean, was this team going out there just looking for fights? Or what was the story? Two minutes into the game. We had five minute major. Well, if you can't, if you're not playing good at least to beat the crap out of Mats, you know, just like Eric at the end of that game last night, you know, they lost a game. So if you're against the least, I'll get old Samuelson and give him a cheap shot and put his ass on the ice. And I score an Eric. Joven, I was killed. I forgot who it was that he was fighting.

Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi, it's Bill. I just moved to Florida and I love it. He actually want to tell you I'm early enjoying your show. Thank you so much, Bill. I moved here from the West Ocean. There's only two things that kind of bother me. I had more NASCAR news and I've ever had my life. Oh god, what's the Yahoo factor man? I've got to factor that in. And I'm getting a little freaked out about the prospect of Monday football starting at 9 o'clock at night on the East Coast. I see not much productivity going on Tuesday mornings in the East Coast. That's for damn sure. And of course, the fact that it starts nine o'clock on East Coast, it gives them a good solid three hours to tailgate and get plastered out of their mind so that if you do have an agotable game on a Monday night, forget it, you'll never get out of their life. That's right. Well, I just enjoy your show and keep up the good. Thanks a lot, Bill. And God bless you, man. Make this tiny Tim said, what a tiny Tim say anyway in Christmas, Carola? What the hell did tiny Tim say that was such a big deal? But I don't think you've got to be saying it no more. Come on, one more time, tiny Tim. Oh, too late. Open line at Broward 767-9463 767-Wiod. Ebony's her screw. Do I think he had the right idea? Forget the monster. That's what he said. He said, let's eat something goyish. You're like a Christmas goose. You know what I always said, don't ever pass up a Christmas goose. In fact, last Christmas, we had somebody in here. I wanted it. But I didn't get it. Here's Carl Springs, hello. That's up to a Christmas goose. Uh huh. That was I was on the internet last night. Yes. And I found something here. I have it on tape right now. I think you may be able to hear it. I think you enjoy it. Okay, Phil Henry, I bet. No. Better than that. Her boss, Miranda, soon. Absolutely. WBC. ABC. It's Chime time, baby. WBC. Hello again. Here's my best to you. Now, there was a guy who was like the Carl the Susan of New York. I think that the 41 seconds of him singing hello again. Oh, my God. That just makes my spinkier twitch. They also have on there a thing when Roby Young was fired. Yeah. That he was on the air, spreading the thing about the Beatles being dead. Yeah. And then they came in and they said to him, you're off the air. He was gone like that. All right. I'm waiting for that. I mean, uh huh. So you can collect a big fat check. A big fat one right. I'll never get that lucky man. I'll never get paid for five minutes for not working. I'll just never get that lucky. No, I've never had that either. You'll give you two. You notice and you're gone.

So to speak. Well, you're going to have to change you from what it's said in the paper today. You can have to change your Larry King thing to say loan me $500. There you go. Have a great day, Pat. Come on. See you. We have an open line in day. It's 6229463. We have one in Broward. 7679463. Thanks to Ellie Brecker and what's his name there that puts Barry Jackson for all the free publicity even if most of the info was inaccurate. But who cares? It's the Harold. Or they run on spots on our station. Like I said, we love the Harold. Not running those spots on a show. Not that they're petty or that they hold a grudge. But they don't run those spots on the knee or I'm just showing up proud of that. We may have dionetics. We may have El Ron Hubbub, but we sure don't have their freaking Miami Harold on a show. Thank the Lord for that. Thank God. Thank Dick Kepon for that. Remember Dick Kepon? Here's a guy. Dick Kepon used to be the publisher of the Miami and the editor. Whatever it was. Another far-bis in a guy. Dick Kepon. He was one of the accruesators against casino gambling. Like that whole family out there who happened to be in bed with Mickey Harrison and his cruise ships were gambling is okay. It's kosher on the cruise ships. It's a cent of fits in town. Just keep that in mind. Because the cruise ships of course happen to be over there by the port of Miami, which is right by the Harold building one Harold Plaza, and they're going to make a lot of money when they clean up that whole area. Their property value is going to go skyrocketing, which will not offset the downgrading of Knight Riders stock. But too bad. They'll squeak their way through. I was out of a Chapman doing dead. We have an open line at Broward 7679, 4663, 767. I've been in this town 21 years. I've seen him come and go. I've seen the media equity. I've seen the cesspool of politics. I've seen the corruption, the bullcrap. I've seen the old people running this town. I've seen the just destroying everything that might have been good like spring break, for example, chasing everybody out under the age of 100 out of this town. I've seen it. I've seen all those crazy old Cubans out there in Domino Park playing with their Domino's in singing La Bamba. And then when they hear the wrong music on the radio drop, La Bamba every now and then here and there. And by the way, I can smell it. I think he's cigar all the way through in here. You know who that's going to upset? You don't want to leave on a bed. No with him, do we? It's not stinky. This is a great cigar. It does smell very good by the way. It's coming right through the vents. Oh, one of a higher. I think it's the cigar. Oh, maybe it's fat boy again. 1145 had Wild. Boy, talk about the enter. He was in here this morning. Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, bop, wow. He just wound up like a damn tighter than a snare drum. And he's going to die. I'm telling. He's going to die unless he stops eating. Any minute now. Any minute now. We're going to have a report that fat boy just croaked. Unless you stop eating. Stop shove it on all that stuff down your gullet. Will you? Down your gulliver. By the way, let's just play the, let's play the soundtrack from a clockwork or in junior year now. Huh, speaking to me, gulliver. I wonder how his snake is coming. Anyway, so I'm one. Bassel. Right. Basil like Beethoven. Anything with a B. As in Beat Somebody Up. 1145 at Wild. 16 Wild. A. You done worse. Holy cow, Aaron's coming. There's only 10 bears again. Oh, yelling. What's this rule up on? I said, Ellen, they said that you're coming out. I said, Ellen, Felix just shut your mouth. There's no need to be offended. Ellen, there's only for suspense. I said, Ellen, you are really intense about women in the biblical sense and the whole life. Well, well, no is. Just a lick of you came right out of your proud to be a you came right out of you. A proud to be a right. Don't worry, folks people heard your career. Help me, Jones come both ways for years. I don't suppose that you are proud to be a tagger and boy did it. I'll be a little bit of a gift. I'll give you a gift. I'll give you a gift. I'll give you a gift. Katie, please don't sing in the blues. I said Katie, did you hear the good news? I said Ellen.

Maybe we can work something out. We have all the Broward lines open. 7679463. 767Wild. Let's see. We got Matt Waden. Because all that money I brought into his bank over there. And we got Jacob waiting for that request. And then of course, you know who else is waiting in the wings? I wanted it. Yeah. CT. Formerly known. The production assistant formerly known as J.C.

There is such a great fresh feeling here in sunny South Florida. Is there really? Yeah. There is in my life. I'll tell you that. We've got a great baseball team. We've got a fantastic hockey team. I'm going to do one. Okay. Sort of a carry now. Yeah. We've got a great football team. Basically everything. And festival. Neil Rogers is moving to a radio station. You're just going to be great there. I've won question for you. Yes. Is there going to be a lot of friction with a lot of the host there? I'm not proud. Based on what? Well, I know. You've been reading too much. Very Jackson, I think. Well, maybe Boone, Chris Moore and. Well, well, well, let me ask you. What are they going to be on? Well, obviously, I know you go. You say your eyes and eyes and you do your show. And that's basically, you know, the extent of the relationship. But I mean, they friendly towards you and in general. Yes, they are. Oh, that's my face. Okay. Everybody's friendly to your face. I see them into games all the time at the hockey games. Always friendly to my face. Even to these pop fans is friendly to my face. Right. Even though he runs around telling everybody else what an asshole I am, he's very friendly to my face. So as long as people are friendly to your face, you know, you kind of store it away in the back of your mind. You know what the score really is. And you just go in and you do your thing. It's take your check and say, thank you very much. And you go home and don't have a real life. I'm sure that they offer a little bit of intimidated that Mr. Neil Rogers is coming over there. And from what I gather, I understand that they're pretty much, you know, all jumping for joy. Well, you have to get on there. I'm sure you'll. And if they're not too bad, like a boat Griffin, I don't know about those by reports from power very early in the morning. This morning, we had two spy reports that Bo Griffin was on there, Hocken and a Chinese and Bop Bop Bop Bop Bop. And who knows? Maybe she wasn't. Maybe she said what they said. She said, maybe she did not say what they said. She said, maybe she said what she said, what she said was something different than what they said. What she said, what I'm saying, I don't. How do I know? I don't listen to that station anyway. Just because I'm going to work for Beesley. I'm going to stare listening to power 96. Are you kidding me? No. I mean, that'll be the day. That'd be like my listen to the hot one of five because he used to work for Cox. That would be my luck by listening to the light bulb because I worked for Practices. And see, that's part of the thing with this company. It would be like my go to work for Beesley. I'm going to stare listening to kiss. I love country music. I mean, give me a break.

Yeah, but, but, but, yes, you know, you would expect a book two thousand years old to have a lot of misconceptions. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers. Yeah. And, but, you know, that was like about the fact that every time of early time there was a storm or was an active God. You think that to be written by primitive people who didn't understand what that was going on. In fact, then when they thought the earth was written on the back of a turtle, yeah, sitting on two elephants. Yeah. In Job, it says God is hanging the earth upon nothing. Yeah. You know, just kind of interesting. And also, uh, two thousand years before. What is it? What does that mean? In other words, you're twisting that and manipulating that to mean whatever it had you wanted to mean? Oh, look at that. Look how bright they were. Look how brilliant they were. It's just interesting that, you know, these things are said, you know, and you would hear, Michael, a lot of it says that the best thing about you moved to QAM is the fact that none of your listeners will ever have to hear. I'm not just news reader again. That's what Mike Fax is. Yes, sir. Good. What are you trying to say? Are you giving me another one of these religious pictures now? No, I'm because you're really wasting the energy path. You're pitching the wrong guy. An answer to what? An answer to what? An answer to what? An answer to what? An answer to what? Well, just try to figure out why the Bible is so consistent. You know, he's just an integral crap about stoning or disobedient kids to that. Is that sound consistent with a loving God? Well, loving God that kept on the Jews to go back and finish the job and kill off the men and women and children that they didn't kill in every tower in the Arab's work. Is that a loving God that you're talking about? I need to agree with that. But you know, 2000 years before they discovered the earth was around. No, but what? You're talking the same crap.

Great. I'm just wondering, Did you get J.C. written into the contract that you am? Oh yeah. Now I got better than that. Good job. Greg Reed is the general manager over there. He lives in Bay Harbor is it? Uh, or Bay Point? Bay Point? In what, In R.K. at G.C.C. He bought his house. Uh, So it's in the deal. I was the day I started and R.K. Moves in with me. I wanted it. That's right. I'm off of J.C.C.C. We match up better against the Rangers or the penguins. A lot of people are asking that question. Right now I don't think it makes any difference. Especially if you watch the Rangers beat Flyers last night. Yeah. I don't think it makes any difference. If we're playing like we are right now, it'll be four and out and goodbye and good luck to us. I mean, we're, You know, I just, I don't see anything happening. And I know last year we went into the tank. But I got news for you. You know, I watched that team play and I saw the dynamics that were involved there. I watched this team play up until about the day. I've been told about the end of November. And this is not the same team anymore consistently poor performance. That's right. I mean, every game in a game out. Even as matter of fact, there was one point a couple of months ago when we, I think we won four in a row. And those were four of the most mediocre wins this franchise has ever had. We just got very lucky at that point. We were starting to play poorly then. And then it went downhill from there. Do I think our last great game was it was it the Buffalo game? No, the devil's game up in New Jersey. That was a great game. We played well in the Buffalo game, but those two games in the last two, two and a half months. I mean, how many other games can you say we really played great? Right. Absolutely. Can I call a couple of you'll do space? Yes, sir. Bruce and Colby, you're great. Okay, pal. Thank you. See you. To our nights the big night we got New Jersey here, baby. We better kick some ass. Of course, you don't have to worry about scoring a lot of goals against them because they got a new deal. They just don't give up any. They just give up the same number every game. Oh, that's right. But maybe tomorrow will wake up. Maybe somebody will light a fire on gigantic forest fire under the wreck homes of the players on our Panther team. And they'll do it again. They'll shock the hell out of us. And maybe Chris Wells will have his ass sitting on the bench again tomorrow. We hope we have an open line at Broward 7679463 767 W.I. O.D. Always in that lovely. Who's that from Alan Mason?

And the restaurant that we had the great food from yesterday, and I was given them a hard time and I forgot about that. And I'm thinking about myself, I was driving the last night home from dinner. And I'm thinking, boy, Kim is going to hate me like poison now, because I was given him a bunch of crap because the food didn't show up as early as we wanted. And it was well worth waiting for because it turned out to be great. And then I, then I, I don't know. I mean, she told me like, our, see, it was our earlier. We're so long before that I forgot it. You know me. Lisa, I mean, Leslie. And so I'm sorry about that. I came on. I never do it again. I'm not getting more food from them. I like that I said. So what is the message on here?

Very nice young lady. Of course, much to do. Much made. I mean, that whole Rick and such thing. That was kind of well, I was like a substitute for a show in those days.

It's almost as great radio as when you open it. We just come to the side of the door there. Like during the, right in the middle of the show and she, like kind of cracks did open it, looks in here and I yell back at her. Hi, hello, you're welcome. Yeah, now it pay back is a bit sweetheart. One more time. Hi, hello, you're welcome. I love it. Here's a lady in the Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Oh. Oh. A lady. You just said you don't want to hear from the women. I was just joking.

From good source? Not source. It's the source. They're being bought by Barnett Bank? Yes. Well, I got to find out if that's true. If they aren't going to blow my brains out. Well, that's why I'm telling you could because of you. I wanted to go to family bank. And I spoke to someone. And in fact, I was afraid to stay it over the phone. I don't know.

Wouldn't that be bad? That would be really bad. 767, 463. But of course, that's the way the business world goes. You know, that's just a rumor. It's a rumor which hopefully will be able to eliminate that rumor. It's not true. I pray. I hope. Just like the radio business. They're all getting gobbled up by the same bunch of, no nothings. It's a lot of things. There's a lot of things going on in this growing stations, destroying People's entertainment, destroying properties, destroying everything in their path, like a gigantic big, like big food. Just Trump just plotting on everything in front of a man. Just stopping now with those big ugly, grotesque steps and squishing everything in his path. Just extending their tentacles and testicles as far as they can, and squishing and squeezing everything that they get their glands and hands on. That's what's going on in his business now, and like, I told you a year or two ago when started this crap. This is the end as we know it. This was a disaster. This was an move of insanity by the FCC. It was Bastards up in Congress who are supposed to be concerned about the airwaves and about the public's right and the right. Give me a break. They couldn't give a crap lesson about anything now. It's like trading cards. That's all. Like a deck of baseball cards here. I'll give you an FM over here and I'll give you two stand. It's 101.

Yes, sir. Good. Do you see that? Good. Do you see it? Do you see it? Do you know I have not? I have no focus. I've got a whole different format. Different day. That's what I hear now. It's somebody we had a Spirey Portiota. They got a new set. They got the coach. I think it's the old news set. The new old set because they had that before a long time ago. Yeah, but he comes out. He does a little monologue. Oh, no. No. Mark Jacobson is doing a monologue now. He's kind of... Oh my God. Geez. He comes out. He looks like he's directing planes under the aircraft carrier. That would be perfect for him, yeah. How much he moves his arms around. Maybe he likes to else sunshine. He's hot in it. Are you turning your back on the other town people? Like, you're not going to be on the audience in that area? We're not. Sure we are. They're on it. The other stations that all you're in there? Yeah. But they don't have like a total free number. So, the country do they? Well, I'm sure that if we if I jump up and down in screen, we'll have a damn toll free number around the country. How do you like that? I feel like give you whatever you want. Get on that right away, guys. Right over there right now, like by the end of the hour. I hope you don't get free up to the training early baseball games. I mean, probably. I don't want to do great water. My big game that starts at one o'clock. You know something? So if I have to leave like an hour earlier someday, oh, what a bad break. Right. It's not too bad. What a bad break. Okay. We'll survive all of us. But we'll squeak our way through. Panthers. I don't know. We need the wind is last two. Get some momentum going on. We sure need to wind the wind the wind the marina. I'll tell you that because if we don't wind the wind the marina, it makes the wind against Pittsburgh Friday, like life and death, and keep in mind that they got four games left and we've got two. And you know they're going to beat Boston and I in Pittsburgh, you just know they're going to beat the scott of the Bruins. You can spell it. We've got a jump on it. Jersey is playing the night and we get some one day. We got a jump on it. We get chance. But yeah, you know, we're at that. We've lost eight of the last nine games we played on once in night. Oh, great. Thanks. Thanks for the good news. We're a little stat. Uh, yeah. We got a lot of weird little stats. I think we need to start from a cool. Right. Well, it's now our neverman tomorrow night's tonight. Let's see if these guys have still got it. Because in the past, in the past one thing about this team, I always said up until like that tree, which I don't want to mention who. But up till that point, these guys no matter how far they were behind in the game, no matter what was going on, you always had the feeling they could come back. They never gave up. They struggled. They fought. But that chemistry just hasn't been there. That's right. I've been blowing. It's been just the opposite. We've been blowing so many leads like the one I washington on Sunday. It's just in the last minute. Last two minutes. You can't do that. 19 ties is a disaster. It's like Mario's leaving, I know it's back, but does because the way the style play is where he just gets beat up. Yeah, he hasn't liked that. And I can't blame him. And like I said, he's had, you know, he had the Hodgkins and he's got a bad back in the recurrent injury in the pain. Who'd have needs it? He's already a multi-millionaire. And he'll be just fine. I mean, you know, I'd like to see him play forever. But you got to have some common sense which he does. Yeah. I kind of like you, right? So keep in mind Friday, it'll be our last, let's we play him into playoffs. Be our last chance to see Mario here. That's right. They should be lined up 5,000 deep. One thing. Would you like to see the game opened up of it? Yes. And I think the techniques that they need to cut back and stick work to spot. But what they want they need to do is go back to the last year's off-side rule. Like you're rid of this new off-side deal, which is a pain in the ass. One of the things that frustrates the hell out of me is a guy, you know, the team is going to be at the late off-side. And a guy goes into the zone like about two inches over to Blue Line and brings the puck out. Okay. He's bringing it out, but because he touched it inside the line, they blow the whistle and oh, I just scream. I see that every game I see that and I say every time I see it, I sit there and scream and yell at carry out because it's so pond-risk that guy is bringing it out already. Okay. What difference does it make? And it's just another excuse to slow it down. And I just think the stick work is farce-hooking and cross-checking in corners and increase. Yeah. Cut back. The guys are able to reach out and hook arms and bodies with the stick and disclose the game that lot. Yeah. You're right. I see public burying these guys. You know, just have a little more open ice. And then that's another reason why I can all use knee injuries and guys like Burry by the way, are injured like 80% of the time. Yep. Yep. He didn't see his knees that many years ago. Did. No, he didn't. Right. Yeah. See you Friday. Okay. We have an open line in Brower at 7679463. Also didn't see all these concussions back then and they weren't they had no helmets. They were playing without a helmet and didn't see anywhere near as many concussions because there's too much crap going on. Two open lines on the out of town lines, 1 triple 84749463188474WOD and Palm Beach on the audio net and anybody else that wants it, we pay for it. They pay for it. Here's Holly Wood. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I just want to let you know that all the guys calling the Barnett banks, fine family bank. Yeah. Right. Work there. They're merged with a little company and left Palm Beach. They're not being sold for anything, buying them. They used to be Barnett bank. You bought family bank a long time ago then they rid on or went out and started the new bank to family bank. Oh, thank God. Yeah. Thank God. I didn't know what she's talking about. Thank you so much. All right. All right. All right. Oh, thank the Lord for that. Sorry, Matt. Sorry. We had that you know, on there. Spreading well, she said that she was a pretty sure wasn't true, but why don't I tell you not to pray to rumor and get everybody where that's called Jewish you know psychosis. Why not? Something to worry about my mother will like that. We have two open lines in Broward 7679463 to on the Palm Beach and out of town lines. One Triple 84749463. So have no fear. Family bank is still here. Oh, thank the Lord. Thank God. Can't take the Lord's name. Oh, why the hell not? Who's it? Where is that written? Who said that? Who made that up? Moishi. Moishi who pooped or a lube and God isn't his name. This is title anyway. That's why they call started calling him God. How about Yeshua? Because in tight. By the way, Yeshua and Yusuke just thought I may for the first time in my life the connection there between Yeshua and Yusuke. Oh, I'm getting it. Here is a Hollywood. Hello. Hello, we will follow you all the way to the queue. Did you see Hartford and Buffalo last night those Pima two open lines in Broward 7679463 7677 WIOD. Here's Miami. Hello. Okay, sir. I'm the goddess. You should listen to your way back. I used to live across your from K18. K18, right. I'm being road. Hey, man. I'm happy for you. You're not getting the Hollywood station. Yeah, out of this joint. Everybody will be following you. Yeah. My question is what's up with facts? And I mean, this guy going crazy. Who's good? He's ruining this another another radio station. Yeah. Locally they did the she look when they did the planet look at that piece of crap. What's up with this guy? He's one of these weirdos is waiting for the ship to come and pick him up. Could be. I mean, it's I'm not so sure he's serious though. Yeah. Did I'm saying I'm going to be a way, Neil. I belison you. Too many yellow pudding pops. I think I've been listening to you for a long time and we will all continue to listen to you no matter where you go. Thanks, pal. Take care. I'll read it here. Gee. Oh, and now we're down to a precious three. We got 48 minutes and 10 seconds to go. Not that I'm counting with all of us. I'm starting a little bit nervous because they've been smoking here today. They've been smoking. They've been forming it them out. They've counted six to two. WiodD. We got no put line there. Broward County. We got a pair of 767, 4663 Palm Beach Waivenbother. Yeah, I have to laugh about that thing about the 800 line for Palm Beach and the the all I mean, what what difference is it make? We never get any calls in there anyway. Like maybe three a day on a audio net, the worldwide like that's a big deal. Forget it. We had a call from Tokyo once upon a time like 85 years ago. And we had calls from New York and from Tampa and then a bunch of boring places and then we had Wal-Tham Mas today, which was fine. But that was it. It's not a big deal. I mean, how the hell does it? First of all, most people don't even know how to download this stuff under. They don't know from the audio net. They don't how to get to live audio. They really don't. I was read about that yesterday. But it's easy even. No, it's easy. But that's beside the point, whether it's easier or not. Most people don't even know that it's there. Number one. Much less how to do it. Number two, if they knew that it was there and they knew there was something there that they might want to hear or check out, that would be like another thing. But not everybody is like Rick Riley sitting around doodle with their computer 20 hours a day, complaining that they got no time to do everything else. I'm sure he's not. I'm sure he's not. Doodle with it. Not that he's a grandpa. We have two open lines in Broward 7779, 463767, WIOD, where it's 1113 on a great Tuesday. Beautiful roses from Wayne Arnold and Murray over there at Wayne Arnold is a royal castle. Thank you so much guys. Crystal's going to love those nice red roses, man.

If you'd like to get your copy of hooked on pizonix, just stuff some money in a plain brown envelope and shove it under the back door of mario's over on the west side and will be in time. So anyway, it's 118 in WIOD. We have two open lines in Broward, 767-463-767-WIOD. Here's Miami on what on three. Hello. Hi, Ian. Yes, sir. Hey, what's the secret wine to? How big are you pardon?

And one triple eight four seven four nine four six three, but he's right. It does take up about a third of the show, given the number out because it's nice and long. And the number two one eight eight eight four seven four WIOD, you can milk that thing to let cows come up. It's still not going to happen. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Hello. First payment is a 25.

Hey, how are you? Great. Listen, I love your show. I've been listening to Phil Henry. I miss him. Yeah. I'm a diabetic. You're retired from the New York City Fire Department. Yeah. I had to trick my way into the New York City Fire Department. I would never have gotten a job if I told him I was a diabetic. Yes. I felt seven stories from my back both my legs. Tom Arotated Conf and I was in the hospital. And no one knows a diabetic and I was getting glucose into Venus. Nice. Great. Sounds like the bases of a great lawsuit to me. Yeah. Oh, it was. Yeah. It was good. But I love the show and I got to fly over to QAM. And thank you so much. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Okay. We got two calls left at the board. We got 40 minutes to go.

White opener is 767. On the day of our daughter's wedding. We got $45 million worth. Our free advertising can remind me, he heard it. And he's back through. Still don't give a crap. They're still dead as a door nail. Especially the women. They're just lying there like in the Pro-Param position. Here's Kendall on a mobile. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are you? OK, sir. I got a good leader in call. I have a spy report about Phil Hendry. Yes. I was listening to WINZ yesterday. Yeah. And they, I don't know if you heard the silly story. I can't believe it was even news. But Billy the Marlins head blew up. Yes. His head is missing, right? Yeah. Anyways, they had a spokesman for the Marlins on WINZ. Are you sure? Yeah. We had a theory where it is, where the head is. And the theory is that all of a sudden the spokesman comes on to Margaret that harbor and that's sitting. They moved on to another story. Isn't that you ripping off Phil's material now? Are you sure? Positive. That was news. Yeah. But also, I thought that story was great. But I was almost whole for you. My own girlfriend's filaments just smashed the back of my car about three minutes ago, but I still, I get driving just so I... Oh, right. That's a loyal collar man. Thank you so much. All right. So we're asked. Or whatever part you like. We have an open line on the EPPOLIN, their Pound IOD. So I and Z is ripping off Phil Henry's material now, huh? Great. Here's a mobile and adventurer, hello. Yeah. The operative question is, is if you're going down the dial allegedly, what do you do with all that fat hand criteria? Can you still use it? Why not? Well, I mean... No, wait, wait a minute. Wait a minute. What do you mean allegedly? What does that mean? Allegedly. What is that? Why are you arguing then? Yes. Okay. Why is it alleged? It was in a paper on Friday. It was in a news I talked about it Friday on a year. I talked about it yesterday. I talked about it today for four hours. No. And it's in the paper all over the whole Harald. You can wipe your bird cage with it. It's all over the place. Yes. I've been out of the loop. Sounds to me, like you've been talking to too many Paxon people who are in denial. Yes, I believe in man September 30th will be my last day working for this company under any circumstances. No matter anything, there is nothing in a world like a keep me here one moment longer than absolutely contractually necessary. Now anything in the world except for not not all the money, not anything. Would keep me working for these people. Except a favor that a band leader couldn't even receive. Maybe I could be accused that. Hey, listen, I've the doubt of the loop. My greatest apologies. That's okay. What are you going to do? What does stuff on it? If you ripped them so much, are they going to sit there? And I mean, one thing in another station, but to be down to all from fat and anchor, is that going to be? Is it going to be one? It can be handle it, or is it can be handle it or? I can handle it. Just like Michael said, I'll handle it. Have a great day, pal. Good luck. I'll read the dirty. Oh, here's your go. Oh, yeah, it's going to be really okay. Whatever you say. Ciao, ciao. Whatever you say. Get out of here. Open line of date, six, two, two, W-W-I-O-D. One of the out of townlines, one triple eight, four, seven, four. They're all experts. You do understand that. Oh, it's going to be this and it's going to be that. Hey, great. Whatever you think. Whatever you think it's going to be, that's what it's going to like Doris Day said. Q-Serie, whatever it tells you said. Now what you said Q, something something to begin with, the Q, I think she was talking about rock Hudson again. Here's North Miami Beach, hello. Don't kneel. See? Thank you for taking my call. Come on, style. My band. I want to give you a godfather update. See? I was at the theater in the honor of the 63th street. See? That bill. And believe it or not, the majority of the people there were young. Really, thank God for that. Exactly. There were two old facts that were sitting behind me though. And there's one of them had a hearing aid that was so huge. It had an LED readout on the side of the side of the... I love it. And she says, right when Pauli gets it. No, Pauli gets it. She says, the sound of a baby killed his father. It's not in law. How loud, you know. And yeah, I don't see, I don't see. You don't tell K. I tell you what, man. It was the only thing. You know, everybody's complaining. I just want to hold back there. That's why I got to love going into movies with the old farts in there when they started talking out loud. It's great. Just in case you can't understand a dialogue. Have no fear. They'll be yapping it out no time at all. I was going to slap her some of my life for a month. I was going to slap her for a month. I was going to call her in Pepperoni, man. Exactly. But anyway, it was a fantastic movie. My best friend took me under the guys that later on. He had their surprise party set up for me. Yeah. I want to call him a douchebag. Okay. Jose. Anaxial Amaziria. Hey, I love whatever the hell I'm doing. It's okay. Listen, you know, poker Brian should make a song. I will follow him. He'll guard. Not bad. I think it would be great. Okay. We love you. Ciao. Hey, Bill Byron. Patzen. We'll guard. There he goes. Talking about those goddamn Italians again. We have an open line in date. 622. So like I said, I had this dire rear for an hour and a half. Oh, anyway, we don't want to go back out of that again. Or was it just dire rear of the mouth? Anyway, 126 to W. I.O.D. The Bible. If you like the book, you'll love the board game. Introducing Go to Hell from Milton Bradley. The board game that tests your faith in God. Well, challenging your knowledge of biblical quotes. Okay. Okay, everybody ready? Yeah, go ahead. All right, first question. The meek's on heret's the blank. Sidewear. Mail pattern ball did. The earth. The meek's on heret's the earth. Right. You move ahead by space. Yeah. You weather guys to go to hell. Go to hell. The exciting game where you win by forming a deep personal relationship with God before the time runs out. Okay. On the seventh day, God did what? A golf. You went to one of those all you can eat, branch places. Mommy just put it around. Wrong. All of you go to hell. It was a good book. But now it's a great game. Go to hell. The biblical board game from Milton Bradley. 132 a WOD. We have an open line of day six to two. We have one in Broward. 767, 9463. How come he didn't put anything on next to that thing? George. Well, because he just called it. I thought I would save the time since we were here. It would save the time for what? I mean typing. Oh. Yes, Dan. I want a heck of a way to get rid of me from your show. Dump it all my cars. What'd you and George do that for? What? Oh, my, all my bits are they gone? Oh, what bits? You know, the Don Johnson stuff. Of course not. They're not gone. Oh, I thought, Lori was listening to you. And she was under the impression they were all like in cyberspace. No, they're not. Oh, you don't think I would throw those out, do you? Well, I thought somebody else was responsible for that. No, no, we were allowed to actually Roy actually let us save about 200 carts here. And yours I can assure you if I could find him, which I can't. But they're around. I don't think it only took I need there to why I'm just tiny. They're around and I took us two months to go through that project because the passion people don't like carts. They like other stuff that cost a lot more money and looks impressive, but doesn't work. Oh, you mean putting them in a computer and all that, John? No, not the computer. We got the computer putting them in the whatever they got, which doesn't work. Congratulations. Thank you, Stan. I guess you don't need my two grand now. No, I guess I don't. Except it is a gift of the day of my daughter's wedding. Ha ha ha ha ha. I think you're going to end up doing some baseball games. That's what I think. I don't think so. Well, you should. You're better at what they got on. Well, that's uh, I mean a lot of people don't remember what a great great. That's all in the past, Dan. It's all in the past. No, it is. It's all in the distant past. I told you buddy Craig the other day that was one reason you were going up over there. Well, you're wrong. You want to set up there in the press box and do a couple of many. You're wrong. I'll bet you do. But you don't. How much you want to bet? I think it works. My wild and a guaranteed. Over a high zing is bald hit, right? Hey, they love me, man. This Barry Jackson. This guy must be doing doggy upwards or something. He's out of his mind. Well, now wait a minute. You haven't heard the latest rumor going around. And what is that? Stan Major today in IOD. Yeah. What is it? What is it? That's it. It's going to buy QAM. Yeah, right. You bet you better call a norm back and get a extra pair of Don't hold your breath. Don't hold your breath. I think it'll happen. I will. Good luck to you, man. OK. Thanks, Stan. Bye-bye. Where's my money? We have two open lines in Broward. 767, 4663, 767Wild. Just keep. You know, I'm now that he said that. I'm starting to get worried because I'm looking. I don't see the damn cards. Oh my god, could we? And we didn't put him in here. Did we? We wouldn't do that because they would make him like two permanent. We wouldn't do that. Oh, hey. It's still the month of May. From 26, I guess you say what can make me feel that way. Stan, major. We have a flash. We have a major bulletin, OK? I'm going to tell you if this happens, I will. I promise you, I will pee on the front lawn of this building. If this comes to fruition, I mean, I know these people are dumb. Believe me, I know that. But can they be that dumb? We just have a very, very strong rumor that the Paxon people are, practically attempting to contact my replacement who, if they have their way, might be. I am that him right. Oh my god. Oh my god. Yes! OK, let's go to a Hollywood, hello. Was that the real Stan major? That was the real Stan major, how do you like that? You know, you're watching the flyer Ranger game on. Was got my real two grand. What is it? Yes, I did. I saw quite a bit of it. I was pretty good. Very entertaining. Very amazing. The way the Rangers came back there and kept pounding. And, and hex still was just losing it. Do you see the way he lost it? Oh, man. He lost it. He's out of control. Yeah. He can't stay in the crease for anything. He lost it. Hey, I just got, you know, go back to hockey a little bit. We're, we're, I think we say we're foreign out if we got, I mean, look at the Rangers, they were clicking last. Yeah. I mean, they got on fire, man. All of a sudden, it's like a light bulb, if I can say they went off over to her head, they said, like, oh, oh, we better get with it. Times run it out. And, but I'm being, they just went nuts. And we're smoking. What, what is that going to happen to us? What is somebody going to light a fire out of these guys? As and say, hey, times run it out. We only got two games left here. We better than, well, when at least one of them, and you better get with it. You better turn it up a few notches here and stop going to this coma thing of yours. I failed, man. So what's the story with this? We lose the next two games. Okay. What would, let's say, let's say this. The penguins have four games left. So after the penguins beat Boston and I would say, well, they'll be one point behind us. New York will be only one point behind us. 6. How? We could drop to 6 if we, if we lose both games. And then who will we play them a three? Then we play a three. That's right. Which would be, let's see, it would be, uh, fill an alpha. Probably. What'd that be, ugly? How about that cheap shot, linders did after the game? I loved it. You guys go on Eric. Yes, because it was all Samuel's and I always love it no matter who it was. But I think retaliation is going to be Thursday night. I don't think so. I don't think so. And I kind of mess with Eric. I don't like that guy. I mean, I do. You do? You wouldn't take it. But you wouldn't take it on our team. You wouldn't take Eric. I wouldn't take it on our team. I mean, I know he's no Chris Wells. Oh, no. Of course you know Chris Wells, come on. Hey, nobody, what I'm saying is he's too good of a player to resort. Let me say it again, pal. The great players, the overwhelming majority, Grady Howell, Maurice Rechart, the great players were dirty players. Don't ever forget it. I don't know what to agree. But I mean, right there, I mean, the game was over. You need to do that. I mean, granted it was over. I loved it. Nice going. Listen, for a guy that's taken more cheap shots than people in anybody else. Who wears a visor by the way, who wears a visor, all feet there, nobody deserves it more than he did. Nice going, Eric. Like I said, what thing we need? We need to Brian Leach. That guy is awesome. Yeah. You got to admit that. Where were we getting that? Where were we getting Brian Leach? You're saying he is Leach. Why would you want Brian Leach when you got Eddie? Eddie. There's no, there are 180 degrees apart. Exactly. I mean, he is just watching that guy skating stuff and how about that goal? You said, I mean, oh, anyway, Brian Leach, God. Okay. I hope you have a great life together. We have two of all the, all the other lines open. Since Stan called, they ran like a battle now. Just a joke, Stan. Yeah, where's that five? Where's all our stuff? Now I'm beginning to realize just exactly what Roy did to us here. Man, he killed us. He butted us to this cart business. Right from the beginning, we, we, we, our ass is weren't even warm in a seat in this building yet. Which thanked to George and Wayne. We finally got the stuff over here because nobody else was getting involved in it. Either the past program director or the president, interim one or the future one. Nobody was involved in it. So we finally got this place put back together. Roy's given all these ultimatums because everybody here is a big shot. Everybody's a big shot. That's right. Thought the eye in a shot. And so about like 90% of our carts are vambles that we'll never see him again. Okay, we have a Broward lines open as in all 20 of them at 767-463. 767-Wiodi. The guy with the eye should be dancing because it's key. Maybe Neil is out. Joey is in. All right. Here is a candle. Hello. Candle. Yeah, deal. Yes, sir. I don't know. Okay. You know something?

Kind of like out there by Northfield and Farmington and frame you whatever the y'all ones are. Right. I was just calm. What you know that I love your show. I love to try to see that he's gone. Oh, yeah. He slipped away. Like Clarence Carter. He just slipped away. I was just wondering, I know you love Jackie and I was wondering what you thought of it. I came against Detroit and Colorado. What did I think of it? Yeah. It was a what? Once in a lifetime experience and I loved what Darren McCarty did to Claude Lemieux. I thought he was should get a medal for it. Okay. Great. So did I. Everybody. Congratulations. There are nice job, pal. Use Bubebud. Okay. Thanks. Have a great day. Bye. Bye. Okay. See you at Northfield down. See you. Hazel Park. He's a park is open now. And of course, I'm a casting in Pompano, which I just mentioned. This is not a spot to mention for one of our fine spots is. And then when Kevin Wallace leaves us in a couple of weeks and goes back to Detroit, you'll at least be able to plunge your brains out all summer long on Kevin because we'll be final casting. Hazel Park every night. All right. Kevin Wallace in Brad Cramer. God, that's all I can see up there in Michigan. They're doing it. If you haven't heard Brooke Daniels lately, here's what you missed. Although if you can't work out with us, you can work in the Bill of Packs and Compound. Oh, the compound. Yeah, the compound. It's just like the Kennedy compound. A lot of people dropping their pants and playing touch football on the ground. All right. You listen to any pants dropping going on a bit at the Eisenhower belt? No, I know there is.
