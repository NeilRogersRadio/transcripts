And now, the Neil Rogers Show. If I was but taxable, the other day the other day the other day the other day the other day the other day the old day the old day. All day long, guys, be the beautiful. If I was a taxable, going, I'd buy up all the stations like the life of lovin' Zeta I and see an IOD. I'd have loads of money in the bank. A knowing was a go-in like Ron's today. I'd have already own that work that nobody carries but everyone has done on the spots. TV cable, real estate I vote O. I'd have a half a dozen big ep stations and 607 am stations too. And that's just in hell and they'll all alone. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. If I was but taxable, the other day the other day the old day long, guys, be the little with my number. If I was more taxable, I'd have already arranged a full man. By the way, the birds come in back. I'd have shackles, you know what I mean. And it's Dan Major. I'd be richer than the freakin' quaste. Steve Kane. When I think I would be turning... Roy Reynolds. If I was that taxable, I'd have called back for man in the crease. The devil's happy only legal and rough need of my order. The score! And if a K turning shouldered off by Lowry but the K get moving. Brandy but K twisting with it. Sennery Passor! Lowry! No one passes! And there's have it, Brogore hasn't left. Up ahead it knocked away by Andrew Chuck. Load it back on again and it's covered by neither fire. Now head into the bench, Brogore. The devil's will go in six attackers. Needed my air sentence to the corner. Hacked along by Devor. Waiting is Gilmore, keeps to the live. Gilmore, shoot! Say it made by Ben Beesbrook. Off Gilmore again. Medmond, Garan, knocked away. Backhand, they're up over the floor. They met him and then out the glass. One line flipped along further. Needed my air around behind me. He's Gilmore out in front. They hack away at it. Still, it's Gilmore to Garan. He can't get it shot away in the way of the Black. Clear back off. able to keep it his own line. The fans are standing. It's difficult to see. Buck came back. Covered out of Devor. Act down the eyes. And in! Get on somebody better tell us redact of Orac. The quick mess in with my predictions. What did I say yesterday? Panthers 3 New Jersey 2. And there it was. 3 to 2. It was right within my grasp and the score 2. And this smart ass kid scores that empty net goal. But thank you very much, Radik. Because you've got on a side of there with 30 seconds left. No traffic whatsoever. Got out of there like a bad out of hell. And it was great. All of a sudden out of nowhere. And of all people. Of all people to set a fire onto the ass of this team. Robby Needemar. Robby Needemar. Who all of a sudden got that wake up call. In fact, as you. And this is the Gods on his truth. God dang. Just before he scored the tying goal there in the third period. And this is the first time we've all seen along one of the game after training after two. He's coming across the blue line. I'm starting my own kind of like under my breath. Robby. Robby. I'm doing it sarcastically. And just before we took the shot, I'm going Robby. And by the big writing that everybody including me gets up and we're screaming. Then of course he gets in the fight and kicks chambers ass. Big time. And then the crowd is all going. Robby. Robby. We're easy. Okay. We forget all the other stuff. Nice going. And then Dave Lowry and what a pass by Shepherd on that first goal. I know you don't want to hear about it. You non-hockey boring people. Okay. It was great. Just with a doctor ordered it's the right time. A freaking miracle. Okay. A freaking unbelievable miracle. Just when things were looking pretty grim and slim and grim. And all of a sudden these guys bootstucked up. Nice going Robby. Nice going Dave. Shepherd. What a pass. So that was some night that the arena last night. The only problem again that the crowd. Oh man. Our topic today by the way and a notice certain shows they're doing topics these days. But our topic. Our topic today is drunken Graham at the sporting events in South Florida. Boy did we have drunk stare last night. We had more drunk spruce square inch than you could shake your thing into. I mean just unbelievable. And then the crowd and I'm not just talking about the aratman up there who's a real ass. Well I'm talking about a whole thousands of people. And the third period there that was that situation I figured it was was it the Scott need a Meyer and Murphy somebody in Murphy. Pretty sure what Scott need a Meyer better check better check the thing here and see you got the double minor. Okay. And Rob shaked the referee cause the penalty. There's an original penalty against jersey and then Murphy and whoever it was I think need a Meyer get into it. Let me check you. Where's the thing? Okay. Let's see. Third period. Yeah Scott need a Meyer. A double minor. And so the referee is called a double minor. nursed people would know how to sit and watch some videos on Murphy for retaliating which is fine. We got the man advantage because we got a powerplay and now the crowd not Even understanding not even getting it even though they only put the two minutes for need them are up there and a board for them. And now the crowd thousands of them are screaming hey refuse. SUN and we're all looking to like what is wrong with you he just gave us a powerplay out of that you idiots you moron when are you better learnyour situons And barricin put going All right by the Way Sorimmer don't get all Ruffl the reason I had to play a mic Emark this morning is So that for some reason, one of the 85,000 power outages and plantation in last couple of days, it flipped over to short play. So I could home after the game last night. And all I got is the New Jersey. Thank goodness I taped in both. See, always have a backup. Always have a backup behind you. Even if it's Paul Coffee. But at any rate, so that's the only telecast I had. And my camera quite frankly, that wasn't his best work ever, but it's all we got. So it's better than nothing. So that's why you weren't on there, remember, so don't get all bent out of shape in psychotic and emotional as usual. Okay, that's the reason we had the Emma Kai-Lights from Sports Channel, whatever it is. That does the devil's games. So there we go. It was a great night. A good time was had by all. We had a lot of drugs. And I saw a mad dog there last night. Mad dog was up there enjoying it. Sitting up there, kind of kicking back with 85 beers in his hand. He was really having a great time. And he said to me, I like guys. And I said, hey, I'll see you. So at any rate, let's see, manage was there, who, well, on and before I left the house, this is the best news of all. Get ready to go to the hockey game, hoping for a three, two path to win. What you really was three, two, the empty net goal was the icing on a cake. All was icing? No, just a, anyway. So at any rate, the phone rings, and who is it? It's that bitch, Eleanor Breffer from the Miami-Herald. That fucking bitch. I just want to say this, okay, Ellie. Don't bother me. Any information that I have to pass along, I will give to Tom Jicka, because Tom, even though we've had our moments over the years, who hasn't, when you've been here for as many years as Tom and I have been, you're gonna have your moments, but Tom's a good guy, and he doesn't write bull crap. He doesn't just make things up. And he also isn't an old job for a doctor tour, that's what the credit created problem, just to get a spicy quote and create some kind of a war. Tom's got a real nice piece. In fact, he ought to be worrying it in that picture. Now I mean, he's got a nice piece of the Suncentalist morning, on page 4e, bid to sensor Rogers prompted move. How do you like that? So at any rate end, basically what I'm reading in the article here is all pretty accurate, and all what I told him. And Ellie Brecker, two minutes before I'm leaving the house to go to the hockey game, and this bitch calls again, I said, what do you want, Ellie? Why do you want to believe this, but I'm writing another story. I said, what's the book coming out already, honey? Why don't you just write a make in 10 million a year and just get it over with make up whatever you want? And she's another one of these people who doesn't get it. She ought to work for Paxon. She doesn't get it. She doesn't get the message. Like a lot of other people that don't get the message, we're getting email now. We're getting facts for people about, oh, wow, Hank, thanks to this. And the Paxon people, see, what you don't understand that little handful of mal content and just out there, I don't really care. I don't care. I don't care if this one's going ballistic. I don't care if that one is having an interest breakdown. I don't care if let's see, where they're bringing in Don, I'm as Howard Stern and Jerry Williams and William B. Williams, they're all coming in here to do midday. Fine. Great. Life goes on. Master Lebanon is they say in China, it's a paycheck, it's a living. Okay, it's a business. But the number, I mean, just a feeding frenzy that's going on here lately. I mean, Stan, major calling and on the air we're here the other day. I almost said they called us somebody off the air, which I don't want to do that. But no, seriously, Stan sniffed it around over here like they're going to put him on the air here. On this radio station again after that earlier debacle to talk about Milky Way dark. Remember those shows were you around there? I was doing them. I was bored. Oh, my God, and you survived that. Let's hear it for George folks. Come on. Remember that's how we got me to job with you. Anybody buy a good watch lately? You know, how many years ago that is? And I still remember it. Now that's like 70 years ago. That's when Mr. Ego went to New York to W ABC for his short-lived run up there. And Stan, major in yes, I must confess. I had, well, I had nothing to do with that. I had something to do with getting money on the weekend there, which was bad enough. But then as a desperation move and they stuck a monitor and afternoon drive and Stan did many, many shows on Milky Way dark and Milky Way lights. I mean, don't take it personal, Stan. It's not personal. It's just business and God. I mean, it was pretty exciting radio. See, there are a lot of people who think that they can do this. Stream of consciousness come on and bop-pop-pop. See, I'm going to tell you right now. I don't care what Walter Sabos says. I don't care what Harry Peanugh says. I don't care what Peter Bolger says. I don't care what anybody says. Topic talk radio where we come on and this is the topic. We're going to talk about how many pedestrians you've hit this week with your car. It is so boring. It is so terminal and the demographics that it gets are so old. Just look at the light bulb, man. They had to put a special column an arbitron for dead people just so that the light bulb could show up in there. That's how old topic radio gets demographically. Because living and breathing people don't care about that. It is so that went out with knickers that went out with two piece bathing suits for men. And these guys, man, they got all the answers. They want to hear those hot topics. They want to hear your push those hot buttons, baby. Even Lardass Limbo is in the tank. This company spent 125 grand. So I was told by the big man, what's his name? What's his name? Yeah, he told me this. He spent 125 grand on Wednesday to get that half-assed fat slabs show. And he's dead in the water, man. Because nobody wants to hear all that right wing rhetoric anymore. They've heard it till it's coming out of their... Breccombe. Exactly. Out of their body parts. But all these people are experts in everybody. They pop up, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, pop plays, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, Pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, I understand listening to you. You certainly could do spag. Do I? Just to me, I've never played anything. Well, can I ask you a question before you go? Oh, God, you sound so stupid. I hate to talk to you. Yeah, go ahead. Why did you call me? I didn't call you. I just said, you're not to say anything. Just play something. Oh, God, can't stand it. Well, then why are you listening? I play something already. Why won't you answer me? Oh, God, can't stand it. You won't see. He won't talk to me. Oh, we got a car here. Hello. Yeah, we better get that car phone. 10 15 and Wild. Never. When my dog is in town, she's not listening to us. What the fuck are we talking about? Penny, we have Wild. The happy Thursday. It's a great day in town. Man, we're going to have ticker tape parades. Everybody is on their feet. Everybody's all pumped up. They are. And of course, we're going to be talking to Mike Lang, the voice of the penguins later on. I want to clock for a few minutes. Don't get panicky now. Rumors not coming. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. I think the team might have their B. I. 12 shot yesterday before the game could be. I think that's what done it. Well, I've not heard you all you're doubting Steve Thomas is out there. I told you three to do banners and I'll take a four to two just to be safe. I think even Joe Wada, a pretty decent game last night. Not bad for him. Yeah, it's right. Everybody's been half the game in a penalty box. Keep this out of trouble. Keeps out of our way. Are you going to a giant class in Saturday? Yes. Well, I want to inflate your red cross the way on the swelpelling the university rather the big, all water pool tournament. Yeah. And you may want to check it out after class. That's in the top players in the room competing there. Really? It's a really fun sport to watch. Very physical and exciting. A lot of almost naked young guys. Exactly. Great. Check out the little short walker. Kind of right on the top and center where you're at there. Oh, it is. Yeah. I don't think there was anything behind the conference center. Yeah. Just a little bit. There's a bunch of naked guys. Just a little bit to the side there. I'm a big, big swimming pool complex. Great. Check out if you put your name on a list. You want to pay admission even. All right. All righty. Thanks, pal. I'll pick it up. Okay. There you go. You know about those swimmers and Polo guys. Two open lines in day six, two, two, two, W.Y. would day two and proud seven, six, seven, anybody out there. Hit any pedestrians this week. Come on. That's our topic today. Who would you rather have the bird? Stand major. Steve Kane, Ellie Brecher. Who do you want to show me days when I'm out of here? Come on. Let's hear it. I hear Andrew Calvins coming back in the fills coming to produce and show. That's the more that I heard. Are you. Well, that's positive. Here. Here. Oh, God. But people are kind of laid in our forces. Did you notice he's not only very defensive continually. And also very, like, you know, he's, he's what he is. But did you notice the little thing he said that we were talking about one of the personalities on a station of Apple to buy a pin to be very weak? And he said, oh, you want to have to worry about that once everything kind of light plays out. Did you notice that? And then like, I kind of like, like, my curiosity. curiosity is all I've put in my car already kind of like a flanked out in the hallway. Once everything plays out. Yeah right. Cause we're terrified of these uh, up this operation, make no mistake about that. Make no mistake. Everybody in the market is terrified that packs my keep it. I mean, my cello. But that's what it is. I had it like almost right. My cello to somebody knows what they're doing. That's what it's all about. So I'm going to read time, jikas, column, and a little while. Just to spice up a little interest. Because not everybody reads the Sun Sentinel, I guess. And there's some pretty interesting crap in there that even I didn't know. Okay, let's go to a adventure. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How about that? How am I to vanish coming on for, sir? He looks pretty good. All we got to do is win one game. There's not one to talk to you about a new uh, new comment commentation I heard this morning or comment on the news. They ask you before we do that. Have you hit any pedestrians this week? No, I'm, I'm trying real hard not to do that. I get into work really early. Okay. But anyways, they just uh, 911 operator the uh, that took the call from that uh, that uh, young teenager that there was some crime going on in her home. And they uh, accused the 911 operator being rude. Yeah. Can you imagine? Yeah. I thought it was a prerequisite to be a resident day to be rude, or at least a tendency to be rude. That's right. Especially if you're going to be a phone operator. Absolutely. Can you imagine if all the rude people in South Florida became like unconscious, like at 10 30 for like two hours? Or if they just left? There would, or if they just left with their baby, would there be anybody here? Not too many, just us. Oh, they, I can't believe it. Just joking George. It said you and George talked you later. Okay. Go get some pedestrians. Absolutely. Okay. Daydelines. Why don't we open here? I thought we'd be having a party on the phone here today. Man, I thought this tower would be jumping on it. Oh, guess who was at the game last night? I didn't recognize him at all. You know, it's embarrassing when somebody comes up between periods and they uh, got a big smile on their face and they shake your hand and uh, remember me and you say no. No, it was costus. Remember our friend, costus the Greek? Not Bob. But like, uh, what's your favorite? And Bob, kind of like a regular guy. But he's in the military and he's got like different hair and he lost a lot of weight and he looked great. I mean, real good. I used to see a costus. 622, W. IOD and Dave. We got any takers this morning. We're going to have to read the time, jicker column to jump start these bastards. I don't want to do that. We don't want to keep dwelling on this thing on and on and on and pop, pop, pop, pop. And let me say it again. LA Brecker don't bother me anymore. When you don't get to get the message, what does it take to get the message across the summities people? I've gotten nothing to tell you sweetheart. Just keep doing what you've been doing. You and Barry Jackson make it up. Just keep making crap up and put it in the paper because we all know the heroes got great credibility. And I don't do that. But I know that you've been trying to stir up the pot and try to get people to say all kinds of crap about me. She did it with uh, we'd let's see with Harry penis. She did it with Rhona Wolf. She's doing it with everybody here called a packs and people and desperately try to get them to make all kinds of cost of comments about me so she can start this war in the newspaper because there's nothing else going on and she's bored I guess. And then she calls me on a phone and sucks my ass over the phone last night like you wouldn't believe. Oh, I wish you the best luck and you know how fond I am. But blow it out your ass, Ellie. Get out and hear already go. I run out of go. You'll go with Randy Rhodes and get out of my face. God, you jacky brought you. Nothing worse than phony bastards who give you the real, you know, they, they're real good. Uh, oh yeah, I love you so much and then behind your back they're just they're just turning it and twisting it and yanking it and pulling it and pushing it to try to stir the pot. Here's a mobile and Palm Beach garden. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Uh, you know how things, um, more things change the money remain the same. Yes, sir. Well, I know who your perfect replacement will be. Okay. Jay Michael. All right. Now we're talking. All right. Great. That'll be a good one. Well, I like that. Yeah. Well, I get one of those. I'll be following you down the dial. That's not what I'm hearing. That's not what I'm hearing. They think, um, they're pretty sure here that everybody's staying with 610 Wild. Well, I think they got a good point. Take care, Neil. Okay. See ya. By the way, what's that, uh, what's the name of that song that's in, uh, the, uh, the, the, the Michael's did. Let's see. I got sunshine. I got my radio. What is that? I guess it's still in the cart. I saved that one. I know what I got it somewhere. It's another one of those Stan Major show, uh, show songs. And I'm sure that in fact, most of the people who are listening now, the same Stan who, who are you talking about? What is that? What is a Stan Major? And then, of course, it was Pete Porcher that, uh, brought that up this morning. Hoping I would talk about that. And they don't want to say, not good for the ratings, Pete. Not good. We don't want to put up all those billboards and blow the audience off. Talk about Stan Major and those, uh, Stokes. Although it is, uh, well, so anybody small, oh, eating any good Milky Way darks. Oh, and by the way. So I spoke to my doctor yesterday. This is a miracle. This is a major miracle. How I've survived this last several months. I'm, I'm not exaggerating. As fat as I've gotten. And I mean, I'm fat again. Gain, all the atkins wait back. But you know something great about the at the, I hope. I hope that that babbling bitch by the way is listing along with your, uh, a physician husband. The one thing about the atkins died, not only does it improve your bloodlip at levels, but at least in my case, it has this tremendous staying power. In other words, you can gain the weight back. You can do all you can eat ice cream and can't. And I'm not recommending that you do this. But for some reason, it seems to there's this residual effect after you've done a long period of time of that. And if at least you try to do it occasionally in between, which it's been very much in between for me, like, you know, six days off and one day on and the diet too. But at any rate, uh, my blood sugar was 139, which is not bad. My cholesterol was 229, which is only like a point higher than it was, uh, some months ago, whenever less time I did it and not really that bad. I mean, it should be under 200, but 229 is not bad for a fatally fart like me. And my triglycerides were 100, which back at the, before I did the atkins, they were 300. Then they went to 66 and then a 77 and now 100, which they, they do tell you now that they liked them to be 100 or less. Used to be 200. Your triglycerides, which is a very key indicator of like fart attack, is, uh, keep it out of 100. But I thought that was pretty damn good. And Dr. What's his name, Dr. Mark said, you're right. These people around here are nuts. I said, I know who's blood is. It must be somebody else's blood test. That's why they came out so good. Now I'm starting to get the message. Okay, we have an open line in day at 62, 22, Wiod, one in Broward, 767, one on the mobile, one purple line, pound, IOD. Two on the other town lines, one triplet, our topic today is your favorite pedestrians you killed. Our first collar will be Rick Sanchez. Oh, so horizontal line? 610 Wiod. Okay, I don't want to let the cat out of the bag, but Pete did tell us who's going to be my replacement here at it. All right. Oh, look at that. It's eating the cart. I love it. It refuses to play. Look at that. I just can't keep my secret. You know how it is? I came to tell you six. Oh, that's the head of my cart. Who will never hear you? I am that him, right? Bye. Joey. I better stop it there, because that cart. That's an old Zeta cart by the way, Pete. Look at that. Look for Melia. Oh, yeah, you got that. I'll bring it back. No, seriously, that's one of those old Zeta. Will you give him some B12 or something? Give him some drugs. Just a joke. Don't you remember you packed up all those carts for me and said, hey, good. Get us the Lommie sandwich. And have a great life and get out of here. They give me a whole, in fact, we're taking these carts too by the way, because they all belong to me or Roy. Should I give him the Roy or should we take him? He said, here, take him with Marblecine and we'll also give you a Stale Salami sandwich from Wolfies right up the street. Bye, bye, Joey. And I'd play the whole thing. You've sent for the fact that this cart is like, uh, and you know something. This is one of those real old carts that's got no, oh, it's got no pads in it. This, how the hell do these play? They don't even make, well, they don't make carts anymore. Anyway, I guess they're hard to get. But these are carts from like, uh, before Einstein was a baby, the ones with no pads. Remember these? Oh my god. Scotch cart two 1827. I love it. And that's just coincidentally, the your joy was born. How do you like that, Joey? I am that him. Rye. Garts Monday, 10 to 2 on 610 W. I. O. D. Bill Marshall's coming back to. We couldn't get the bird. Little too expensive. Bill Marshall's coming back on a laugh loop. Here's Carl Spring. Hello. I know how you doing. Great. When you leave him for QAM? Some day. I don't know. Some day soon, some day down the road. Who knows? Only the shadow knows. I don't know. I can't fight. If I knew a date, I would tell you right now. If I were a betting man, I'd say someday. So rumor has that you're teaming up with the mad dog and Brian Cox. Yeah, we're that's right. We're doing it. Yep. I don't want to say what we're doing, but you can guess the panthers look pretty good last night. They were great, man. What a night. What a great night except for the drugs and except for those assholes that don't understand the game you want to referee, but other than that, it was great. They look pretty good. I got to be a rat. Few is stuck. Yeah, but he just called a double minor on Scott Neetermire. He plays for New Jersey. Maybe the thought it was because his name was Neetermire, it was on us. These people are so dumb. It's four years already. Dummies get with it. Learn the game a little bit. They knew I got to be on the 3D up in a flyer for 13 years. No, Lynn Ross, the next two games. He's just got suspended a sentence, by the way. It's Michael Remberg out for the year. I, well he said that it wasn't as bad as they thought, but I don't know when he's come. No, he's not out for the year. I tell you what. He got like eight million stitches in his post. I can't believe Bobby Clark has an address to go to an situation there. If we would add a gold tinder, I mean, they can go somewhere. Yeah. Hexpawn that I'm ready from the drape back, Pallylumberg in between the pipes and they're bringing it back. I'm sorry. We're going to put him in Terry's saw chuck in there together. They're going to time together. Say, anybody can take that. It's going to be a good playoff at the shirt. It's going to be exciting to watch. They're going to bring Lynn Hall back and see if he still pukes before the game. All he did play for Chicago and St. Louis. How'd you vent, Ronnie? My vet is running great. It's a beautiful thing. And now I have two vets that are totally different. And how happy could I be? You know what I'm saying? You got an NSX 2, right? Yes, I do. 96, a 96 red NSX, which I don't drive, but it's a great car. What about the Lumina? I can't afford it. Have a great day, pal. Yeah, I'll call for me. Yes. Ricky, Jimmy, and Dennis, you're a bunch of flaming, drip-y douche bags. All right. Yeah. Can I make one request? I always Steve Conway is going to be doing mid days. What is it? Can I hear the two-wee we found, please? Okay. Thanks a lot. See you. The two-wee we saw. Oh, and now look, oh, and Dave Grave line is going to be doing it. The bulletins are coming in fast in furious. Dave Grave line is going to be coming in the course they're going to lock down all the equipment real tight. They're going to tie everything down real happy duty. My buddy, my buddy, my buddy, my buddy, my bro, my extra wee wee. You only have one wee we've done. Oh, Mommy, I like to form. No, no, you're only supposed to have one. Is Daddy the food? No. He has two wee wee. No son, he's helping out for a little bit. Mommy, no. Yeah, a little one he's eating with and a great big one he brushes the babysitter's teeth with. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. Happy to have Thursday to your suratah. Great day, man. I haven't run over you. Today's pedestrian's all the way. Try to the dining area you move too fast. Have you ever had even noticed Rick and Suds are doing topics. Now, which I know Rick would deny vehemently, but I noticed they're doing topics. It seems like a disease we better stamp it out before it kills Wild. They're doing topics now. You don't think that came from Walter Sabo. Do you are consultant? Oh, God. I hope not. Oh, my God. We're doing topics. Even on the Rick and Suds show. That's that's a scary thing and Rick keeps saying we're not going to do topics, but the topic today is. Yes, there it is. That's a clear indication of the downfall of West civilization. It is. Listen, great game last night. Robin Eatermire had some testicles for once. Robbie was here and you know something earlier in the game he wasn't doing anything. He was just, but I sat there in my seat as they crossed center ice. Here was Robbie with a puck and I still going. Robbie, Robbie and he crossed the blue line. I went Robbie and he took that shot at all of a sudden. It's in the net and everybody went ballistic and from that moment on it's like somebody woke his ass up. Like he came out of a rip fan week of like coma. Yeah, he did the Gordi. He beat the snout out of Sean Chambers there, which was great. I love that. He just beat the, he picked somebody good to fight with. He didn't pick like a lil odeline or somebody like that. Yeah, rock and dannico. He didn't mess with them. He picked somebody who could beat the crap out of me. Didn't nice job. Nice going Robbie. He did a Gordi house and the crowd is screaming. Robbie, Robbie, what an eye to be there. How to bad the fans didn't understand what was going on most of them. Oh, that was hilarious. I mean, we got a power place. Got an Eatermire got the gun. Look, it's a double minor. They give him four minutes. We're all excited where I am and any other assholes across the way. Thank god on the other side. Oh, hey, ref, you suck. I think they're too close to the red man. I think it's rubbing off. Yeah, all right. But you guys get a clue over there. Yeah, I told the alcohol the We're going to know what we're going to do in the playoffs because they're such a demand for tickets. Now we're going to give them all a written test before they are allowed to come in the arena. If they can't answer your five basic questions about the game, then I got to be allowed to come in no matter how many tickets they've got, how much money they got. That means nobody from Dave County's going to pass. Right. Listen, just have one shameless request. Yes, sir. Play Mike Land calling a stew bar into a Mario and you go. A stew bar in school. Well, while we have like on it, one o'clock. Oh, okay, but I love to hear his calls. Can you just play dog, go home? Four minute penalty. Johnson looks at over. He's got it. No, man, still far and just get it by. Do's it off and the penguins have a four to two. Oh, fucking nano. That wasn't very good. I don't like that. In fact, I don't even know why that one is in there. Okay, that wasn't one of Mike's, you know, a Hall of Fame calls. I wouldn't say this might be better. Yeah, better than penguins. But I had the thing with breakout. They're going to dance here. Here comes six on the right side to get any of his friends. Hold it down. He's waist got him in open here. Five. Seven. Yeah. So far. The goal in the penguins. Ladies and gentlemen, I'll never teach a penguins. The barns. Two open lines in Broward. 767. 463. 767. W. I. O. D. R. Pull question today. Is it Joey Reynolds? Is it, uh, Davey Gravy line? Would you like to have Stan major on here? Midday. But he like to be pain. How about Alice Rantel? Come on. These are the names Jim Phillips from Orlando that's very hot. We're the largest starting. We got some heavy new names coming in to replace Buffalo. It'll be a piece of cake because when I see what plays out here, it's going to be dynamite when they start playing at full commusic. It's going to be good. That's right. Everybody's here replaceable. I'm not under any delusions about that. This station has got to continue rolling along wheel strong. Sing on a song. A lot of thought. So Tom Dicker, right? This is that rocker's prompted move. We'll get to that moment fairly. Nice article, Tom. See one thing about Tom Dicker, you can trust him. If you say something to Tom, like, well, this is off the record. He doesn't put it in the paper. If you say here what I think, he puts what you think into paper and doesn't like change it to suit himself. Even if he does have a big ball spot. But with Eleanor Brecker and Barry Jackson, who are busy doing magic mushrooms, I guess. They just hallucinate and then they start calling around trying to stir up trouble. Just when I would just when we got out, they pull us back in. Remember that Godfather 3, just when we were out, we got out, they pull us back in or whatever. What did you say? Let's get to script from Godfather 3 and see if the Pope wants another glass of a tea. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. All right. You think the fans didn't know the game yesterday. What are they going to do tomorrow when it may be the last time they see Lumia play? I'm going to tell you if we don't respond for a, yeah, that's a very good point. If we don't respond for Mary or the way we should. In fact, it's very possibly the last time he's ever going to play here because unless we meet them in a playoffs and it's possible we would not. Unless that happens, he may never play another game here on our ice. And if we don't treat Mary or the respect and the admiration he deserves, then I'm going to be really pissed off because Mary was, you know, I know that some people say Bobby or and I used to say Bobby or and some people say Gritsky, which I get really pissed off with that nose. But to me, Mary or Lumia is the greatest player that ever put on a jog strap man. He's the best. Go, Ben. Bye. See you. Go, pens. Yeah, right. See now I take it back. Like I said, just be silent. Go, pens. No, not go, pens. Blow, pens. They got no defense. Just keep that in mind. Shekky, go, attending no defense. And also the rumor is that Yager will talk to my client about it later. Rumor is that Yager has that re-agorated that hamstring and may not play in the game tomorrow and I'd very good chance of that because in the game last night in Boston, I mean, two nights ago, he looked really off his feed and was a non-factor Yager. And if they don't have him healthy for the playoffs, they'll be out fast. I mean, real fast as in Zippity, Duda. But we'll find out from what's his name later on. What's his name? Oh, yeah, the great Mike Lang. I want to say to mention two times somebody gets upset. Here's Kendall. Hello. Yeah, I ain't the old quick tackle question for you. Yes, sir. Did you see yet the replays of the goalie took away from the last night? The email and be in the creasing now. No. Okay. Well, the way I understand the role is the puck has to be crossing the goal line, not to crease. Wrong. Wrong. Wrong. Okay. His right to hate has to be out before the puck enters the crease. Right. Okay. And our boy Dennis probably, I'm not a completely wrong. Well, he's got the role wrong. A lot of these people don't know the rule if they'd read the rule. They'd find out that when the puck is going in the crease, if you're in there, it's not a goal. Well, the producer had to say to him off camera. His stick was still in there. That's why they just allowed him. Well, I knew it wasn't going to be a goal, because I saw him desperately. If Enoe was in there, Scott Scott, and he was frantically trying to back out. And even if the puck was in the net before he got completely out of there, even if you've got a tonal in that, I mean, it's the worst rule ever. And this has got to be the last year for it. It's a nightmare. And the fact that Brian Murray is defending that rule really frost my ass a lot. Not a little bit alone. Especially when his own players saying we're going to be called, religiously for it. Right. Well, everybody is called for it. I mean, every every timid league has been hurt by that this year. And it's just dumb. Now, last night, I will say that Melon B was right in the middle of the crease, basically. And it could interfere with Broder's ability to see the puck. But most of these goals that are being disallowed is the puck goes in on one side. And here's a guy like that Sunday in goal when we played the least here a few weeks ago. Sunday's got a tonal on the red line on the border of the crease. And because he's like touching it with a puck isn't a no goal. You know, that that's just bullcraft. So we're a rule. The worst rule in the history of any sport and they better cut it out. Okay. Next question. Because like Jerry says, boy, if we have a big goal, this allowed in the playoffs because of a bogus rule like this, people are going to be pit-thaw. Okay. Next question. Yes, sir. The auger played a long night because their last game is Sunday night, at Boston. And I think tomorrow night came to be more important than them. Yeah, but you understand if he's like, if that, I mean, would you play him if you're going to jeopardize him for the playoffs? I mean, a one thing they do know they're going to be into playoffs. And I sure wouldn't jeopardize the auger because they're a total, I mean, Mario is great, but without the auger, this is a different team. They got to have him in there. I'll see you point. All right, appreciate it. Don't forget, don't forget if we beat him tomorrow night, doesn't make any difference what they do against Boston. They are strict. Or against Tampa tonight. All we got to do is win one more game. Okay. After last night, we will. All right. All right. See you later. Could it be happening again? He asked just like last year. I see I didn't believe that. I thought that all these. I mean, I'm a doubting Steve Thomas. I just don't buy this crap. But it could be going to a blue deep funk and all of a sudden something somewhere, some magical thing. Fat Neil gets on a year, predicts the score and says these guys are going to win tonight. And they didn't believe it. Then somebody, the coach on a bench dug with Francis Hayne. Neil says we're supposed to win tonight. That means we got to score at least three. And all of a sudden, he's guys wake up like magic. As I wolfed my magic spell and I'm going, Robbie, Robbie, all of a sudden, but I'm being. But I'm being. As Mark Meculian would say on the CBS morning news and why does he said, we have an open line. I mean, there ain't no black people in the godfather. Okay. There's no what they said. So let them lose their soul. Something like that. I think the shoes, shoes salesman said that. Oh, shoes Steve said that. Oh, by the way, shoes Steve's going to be doing midday. We have an open line in day. It's 6 2 2 9 4 6 3 6 2 2 0 jury. William is just coming down. Okay, well we got to do a thing. No, we got to do a thing. I got so much going on here. I got that jica thing which I'm desperately got to read that because it is really very entertaining. I thought since most of it came for me. Oh, catch up on your sleep with Stan Major. This afternoon to on new stock radio 6 10 W I O D. 10 50 W I O D. We have an open line in day 6 2 2 9 4 6 3 6 2 2 W I O D. Want a big rate to get all the old people back on here again. Sam Geisons is going to be going to tend to Larry bottom some teeth. Here's sunrise. Hello. Oh, I'm going to the other going. Great, Joe. And the same major used to be a DJ in Toronto. I don't think so. I don't think they let them in. Anyway, I got that last color. Talk about what I was going to talk about the going in the crease. Yeah, that's a rule. It's still black and white. It's got to be some gray area. Like if you're on the opposite side of the crease of the golly. If there's interference with the gold tender, then the goal should be disallowed. And as nothing to do with the gold and it shouldn't then forget it. And leave everybody alone and go get a life. Yeah, if you're on the opposite side of the crease, it should go in. Right. And just after that, pot van said, I don't know if it's exactly where he was mentioning that he was who would have known that God would have been there helping the golly. Who would have known that God was there, huh? Yeah, that's what he said. God, I thought I was sitting in my seat. And why didn't God help the going go in better, you know, like, I feel really, really happy. Yeah, well, leave it to Dennis to come up with another lesson on comment. That's what he does best. He had two or three weeks. He's really been in Coherent lately, more so than usual. I know, he had a hat trick of incoherent, he left me. Good. Nice going, Dennis. Maybe that's why my VCR shut down. Thanks a lot, pal. We have an open line in date. 62294636222WYOD. We have a parent, Broward 7679463 767WIOD.

They don't have no bread in it and don't have no leaven or liven or nothing like that in it We'll find out some jubal call Anyway, we have two open lines in date 62 2 Wild 2 and Broward 767 9463 Bit-dissensor Rogers prompted move rights time jicken to paper this morning Something to look forward to it says near Rogers says that someday he'll tell the whole story of the contract negotiations that culminated in his jump from Wild WQAM In his characteristically colorful manner Rogers promises it'll make your hair stand on end Of course I forgot I was talking to Tom which I think it happened Tom I think I told Tom it'll make your hair grow back in the meantime Rogers fans will have to settle for the condensed version version Which is still pretty juicy A window open for Rogers to consider new options when packs and communications acquisition of cox owned Wild Wild was completed on September 30th 1996 Rogers had signed a five year contract in February 94 which contained an escape clause Who would change hands? Rogers had a year from the date of the sale to terminate his contract provided he gave 60 days notice or more Uh Rogers is an outspoken controversial showman on the year off the year he is a soft spoken and cordial With a strong sense of professional loyalty His initial inclination he says was just a Wild Wild which has been his radio home for over eight years I didn't want to create a bidding war anything like that I was trying to be a nice guy that was my stupidity said fat Fag Neil Indeed Rogers and his attorney Fag Norm Kent approached packs in about an extension to his contract In return for a longer deal they saw the signing bonus and a pay raise a customary practice in show business According to Kent the packs and people were amenable amenable Attempts to reach Jay Holker president of the packs and radio group were unsuccessful a secretary said he's out of town Isn't that unusual he's out of town? Everybody in his company they're always out of town This bureaucrats out of town that one's out of town They're on a plane on a way to a Montana They're on a way to U. May Arizona but's on a plane circling New York Rogers salary was to be kicked up to about 650 grand a year from approximately 500,000 last numbers wrong time And we'll get a $200,000 signing bonus Amating to formalize the contract extension was said Rogers even told his listeners on the area to greet to re-up To re-up it as in However, problems arose when packs and demanded a quid for its quo A quid for its quo interesting that's going on time Palm Beach resident butt packs and ones of the company is a board game Christian And he reportedly was put off by some of the racing material on Rogers show His lieutenant's ass Rogers decided to agree with that he would tone down in effect cease doing such material Any departure from pack since restrictions could result in immediate termination As far as Rogers has concerned packs and wanted to strip the format that's dominated south Florida ratings throughout the 80s and 90s Kent says he informed packs and we will not change anything in the contract that reduces kneels rights Right? Right. During the ensuing given take the new owner made a counter offer of three strikes in your out according to Rogers He wouldn't be subject to firing unless he violated company policy which goes beyond FCC guidelines three times within 12 months There are days jica says when Rogers violates those rigid rules being suggested three times in 12 minutes How about 12 seconds time? God dang We told him the stick it can't says Finally Rogers said a deadline for packs to agree to a new deal with your language 15 minutes before the deadline according to Rogers Packs and officials called and said they would go along Rogers said he thought the deal was done That was on a Friday by the following Monday Rogers says a new complication arose Packs and wanted Rogers to sign an agreement to abide by company policy manual the one with those Christian values that that thing It is not as restrictive as the conditions suggested previously, but still what a cramped Roger style And I'm not becoming a Christian, okay? The breach of faith as the talk host consider it was the final straw every time we thought we had a deal They came up with some new crap Roger says underline the crap Kent was authorized to open negotiations with WQAM Well WQAM for my dissolve sports Rogers makes a neat fit because he's never in sports fan And his program already features a heavy dose of sports talk more over Rogers audiences dominated by young males WQAM's target audience Wiod jerked us around for five months Kent says I had a gremo with WQAM for twice the money within 24 hours Within 72 hours everything was approved the deal was sealed at the end of the week Rogers will keep his current hours of 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and the show will not change it anyway he says God dang that might change The only remaining issues are when Rogers believed Wiod DN started on WQAM contractually he is bounded Wiod D till September 30th he says he will honor this commitment all over He hopes Wiod will release some early or time is it George His contract also contains a 90 day no compete clause which could keep him off WQAM Till January 1 I'm hoping we can work something out that that doesn't happen Roger says But if it does if it does he says he's been promised by QN that he'll be paid while sitting on a sidelines WQAM extended the same consideration when Jeff a de 4th moved over from Wiod at the end of last year Rogers jokes that he wouldn't mind having a few months off with pay to travel especially at his new salary level As Tauy feels to finally be in the million dollar a year category Rogers quips Great I think I've earned it after all I've been put through after all the crap I've been put through We left the crap out of their time nice going Tom actually contain most of what I said Unlike Eleanor Brecher and Barry Jackson who just sit there kind of make it up as they go along and try to stir up problems Try to stir up problems try to create some hostility there try to get other people to say crap about me and me to say crap about them They say no crap about me. I'll say plenty of crap about them, but that's nothing new they kind of enjoy it Don't they here's a lady mobile in Bokeh hello Yes, man you don't know a thing about Farple don't even borrow the coming back Okay, I'm listening Yes, Farple is little pieces of much right.
