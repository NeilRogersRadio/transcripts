The date of the year. 610 WIOD Miami Fort Lauderdale. 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rogers show. To talk with you, I'll call 622 WIOD and date. 767 WIOD and gravity on this station. We're going to crack your entire whole number. It's a while to go to that. In somebody on the run and run, you'll say, not exactly, I think you're a little more, or you'd just leave the rest. The nation did somebody on this station. We call toll free at 1-88-474. It's a trailer park trash say, and now, the Neil Rogers show. Hey Brian, are you happy? I hate WIOD again. I'm so glad to be here. Are you sure? No, I'm not just following this tasteful. The dolphins are cursing and man. It's disgraceful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying, It's not my fault. They're my fault. She got you, but the f***ers are lovers. They toss in the microphone, the dump button just can't seem to be left alone and all of this is because they like saying. So much f***, they got you, but the f***er. Okay. Oh, but they play football badly. I'm so wrong. How did the patriots kick their ass? So fun. Well, they make it to the Super Bowl. But with an attitude as bad as theirs. They're tossing our hopes down the stairs. Oh, man. No doubt. I'm not just following this tasteful. The dolphins are cursing and man. It's disgraceful because Brian Cox and the rest of them are saying, It's not my fault. They got you, but the f***ers are saying. So much f***, they got f***ers. They're saying, it's not my fault. They got you, but the f***er are saying, It's not my fault. She got you, but the f***er are saying, So did somebody on this radio station, some cracker from some trailer park say crackhead Nigger Horror on a Ronanron show at about ten minutes before the hour or did I dream that? Was I having like hallucinations? Did I just imagine that? I mean, I realized that that show is geared strictly to a trailer park trash toward Redneck Yahoo's with big pickup trucks and dobermans. Oh, excuse me, I like dobermans. Pit Bulls. But I mean, what the hell was that? And then they left around here. That was the best part, okay? Redneck Central Baby. That's where it's at. Crackhead Nigger Horror. And the caller they were referring to was somebody that said, Hey, you guys, with your racist crap, you're all done. And you know what I think she had a point. I think she had a point. I mean, I could be wrong about that, but I think she had a point. In fact, my prediction is in just a few months there will not be one show left on this radio station that was on it. Back on September 30th of 1996. Anybody want to take me up on that? Other than, of course, what's the one we got on a toy's for? Goi, I'm. Hills still be on here. He's got the naked pictures that Stephen J. Gay. I understand that the new regime does not like those special interests. Okay, like I said, they're all out including that bitch I ring Richard. They don't like those shows. What they do like is some of what I heard last night again. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Did I tell you that Walter Saber was the anti-Christ or not? By the way, happy pace, I'm really pissed off at the Sunset or from putting these old Jews on a front page of the paper. Oh, hey, my, I mean, look, there's a Jew. Yeah, did you see that? You see what they got on a front page? All these, and if you read the caption, which nobody does, the headline says, celebrating the start of Passover. And it shows all these stone age old Hussitum there with their payouts and their heavy coats. And God, they must smell really good. And they got a fire going over there. They got the burning bush on fire. And it says, preparing for paystock, ultra-orthodox Jews in Jerusalem, used bonfires to burn 11 food items or objects tainted by them. Oh, my God, they're burning it over there. People are starving to death. They're a bunch of slippers over there. They haven't had a meat in their meal in the last six years. And they're burning crap because it's 11. So anyway, getting back to Walter Saber. And the stuff I heard last night, I mean, I hate to break the news to you. But all of these tight little cute topics that people are bringing up now, this topic driven, which I told you was going to happen and they denied it because they lie a lot. I told you, that's their idea of what it talks you was all about. Of course they're going to sell it anyway, so who cares? But what did I tell you? Oh, no, we're not going to do that. It was hot button topics, baby. So last night we had, what's your name? We had Aaron K. on and also the ski monster. He was not a bad guy, by the way. He's a pretty good guy. Kind of like dull on the area, you know what I'm saying? But nevertheless, she was talking about some story from Kansas about some guy that gave his girlfriend a $9,000 engagement ring. First of all, who in his right mind unless they're loaded, unless they're, uh, gives anybody a $9,000 ring. I'm going to stare out of their mind. And then they split up, does he get the ring back? And she's reading this article over and over. Somebody's going to call in a course like three or four in Cipid calls that we had here about water again. How they were house looking for houses and water doesn't want to send lease because they're not married any odd yaddi, yaddi. And then skiggits on Aaron, he's doing a thing about, um, about service in retailers. I really can't even tell you what the topic was. I can't put my finger on it. And all I hate to break the news to all these experts who have come in here to try to reinvent WIOD, which is what I predicted months ago, all of these tried little cute topics years. They've already been done over and over and over and over again. And they're viable by the way, which Walter Sabo is the president of. This talker's magazine, which you notice this is all over the building. Now, if you're where you look, there's another copy of talker's magazine. Even I'm on a mailing list now. So if we want to start our own bonfire, we got some good stuff. Here's the talker's 10. Here's the top 10 hot topics. Here are those hot topics that we can get those peaks of 20 shares with. Like buddy Budwood say, peaks of 20 shares. If we just listen to Walter, number one, Colts and Madness. Number two, science. Number three, politics and scandal. Number four, the legal system. Number five, conspiracies. Ooh, it must be the trilateral commission. It must be the new world order. That's responsible for that crackhead, Nigger Hor, calling that show this morning. Can you believe that? And they left around the year. That's the best part of the whole deal. You saw my reaction. Crackhead, Nigger, hole. What the hell is that? Man, oh man. Number six is natural disasters like the Ron and Ron show. Number seven is sports. So we don't want to talk about that, not here. Number eight, gay right to lifestyle. Number nine, arts and entertainment. Number 10, relationships and gossip. Those are the top 10. Those are the hot topics they're going to put WI do over the top. I say, by the way, Phil, Henry and could have been here today. He's doing a deposition. So that's why I played that thing at the beginning. Just, you know, for a little while, stalgia. For a little while, stalgia, because, you know, what? Back in those days, back before this new regime took over. When Rick and Suds were struggling in the morning, but nevertheless doing okay. And I was sitting here, fumbling along in the mid days with seven and eight cheers. And Phil, Henry was in the afternoon entertaining the hell out everybody. And even the sex bitch and night, you know something? And I was waiting to what we got the certain hours, which I don't want to mention. No names. She was not so bad. Her biggest problem, except for that fake voice in the Fony laugh, was the fact that she ran out of topics after the second week. But she was another graduate of the Walt Sabos School of Media. Oh, but you don't know who is coaching her every day. Harry penis. Coaching every day on the topic, said is, I mean, every single day. And she was a big star up there in Orlando. See, I hate to break the news to these guys, but what plays in Orlando ain't necessarily going to play here. This is a Mickey Mouse place, but not quite as Mickey Mouse is Orlando, which is a real real, real, no-spicgin place. I mean, it's like light years ahead of Tampa, but it's still a real, real, serious, no-spicgin place. Up there in Orlando. Lots and lots of Bible Thuppers and good old boys. I mean, if you took Disney World out of there, all you got is a bunch of fruit growers. And a few fruits. And that's basically all you got. That's Orlando for you. So anyway, I hate to break the news to these experts that are going to reinvent this radio station, but all those great, tight topics they've all been done until they're coming out of your ears. Nobody wants to hear about service in God damn Florida, okay? Nobody wants to hear about it. Nobody gives a flying crap about hearing about what your name is dating the, you know, after the first five weeks of that enough is enough already, okay? I want to hear more about the earwax, though. I want to hear more about those cute tips. Do you know what I'm saying? That's what we all want to hear a lot more about is that waxy build up. Because behind that whole thing there's something really I can't put my finger on. I want a lollipop little boy. I really can't figure out what that's all about. Here's a mobile on Wild. Yes sir, our first call of the day. Listen, this is going to be a great Tuesday man. You are so right, you got no idea. And the proof is in the pudding because nobody called in. They would such a lollipop call. She couldn't believe it. Yeah. And she was just grabbing her ear. She must have read that article of 400 times in an hour and a half. And how come she was only on for two hours? And the ski for Remski was on. What's that all about? She ran out of, she ran out of things to say. It was almost embarrassed. What do you mean by that? She had nothing to say and nobody called in. So she just left? There were times when nobody was talking. What do you mean? Did we just dead here? Just yeah, from moment. You better watch yourself, Mr. You better watch yourself because she's in tight with a consultant man. This is a joke. This is like, I was listening to the stuff that was going on on and off on a station last night in between 85 hockey games. And I'm going to tell you something. It's enough to make me cry. What are these people thinking about? I don't know if we listen in the evening, but I got to tell you something. They must think we're in Jacksonville, South Carolina or somewhere. I don't, they don't, they have no clue. They have their totally out of touch with what this place is all about. You're right. But hey, have a great day. Hey, come on. Okay. Hey, it's the first day of Passover. What do you want? Look at that board week. We got no calls here today. Panthers playing the Rangers in New York tonight. I'm going to play all my hockey high stuff today. I got some great exciting stuff. I got Rick Jenner Red. I got Bob Cole from one Edmonton tied a game up on Sunday night with three goals in a year. I got some great stuff because I'm not going to see anyone talk about some asshole paid $9,000 for an engagement ring in Kansas somewhere and should he get it back. You know something? I don't care if he gets it back. Do you care if he gets it back? I don't care. I do care about that crackhead Negro Hork comment on Ron and Ron this morning. Next thing they're going to be talking about the Huracoon football team. I mean, what the hell is that? And if anybody can't tell the difference, I feel really sorry for you. Okay. Okay. Let's take these hot topics one by one. Colts and madness. What do you say? Six, two, two, double. What do you mean by that? No, that's the way she did it last night. She read the article. She read like a little blurb out of it. Okay. He spent $9,000. You want something back? Okay. Six, two, two, double, you IOD. It's called contrive man contrived. And be sure and present it in such a way that it'll really get the audience whipped up into a frenzy. Contrive controversy. What do you think? Are you pissed off or what? There we go. Let's get a pissed man. It's a paced song. It's even a work day today for teachers. Why can't they just be honest and say it's a Jewish holiday? Why can't they say that? The Jews are celebrating paced song today. They're eating cardboard. What's wrong with Tom kids the truth? Oh, it's a teacher's a work day. Isn't that what they're calling it by the way? Teachers work day. When it's a glacial holiday, when it's Easter, it's Easter. It's Christmas, it's Easter, it's whatever. Which I guess basically that's it. But when it's a Jewish holiday, it's never like a Jewish holiday because Jews are a small minority. So it's a teacher's work day today. We got to pass upon the Jews. You know, that's the way it goes. Kind of crap is that. It's paced. It's paced over man. Oh, God. I'm gagging on something. I think they got the poison gas going against speaking of hear my I'm hearing. I think they're pipe and a poison gas in here. The paced people. I wouldn't be surprised if all their sabos got his fine finger in that. Or maybe it's fine Q-tip is stuck in the middle of this conspiracy. And conspiracy is number five on list by the way. Let's talk about the Paxon conspiracy. That's one of those hot topics that sure to give us peaks of 20 shares. They don't like to all that inside talk. Oh, that's right. Let's see. We don't like the inside talk. We don't want people talking about WIOD because nobody cares about the station. We don't want to talk about any of the things that are going on inside. We don't want the producers talking on the air. Sorry. As whole. We want those hot button topics. Let's get back to what it's all about. Okay, what do you think? War or peace. Life or death. Right or the far right or the far left. Cosseed him with long a pace. Who's got the better dreadlocks? The houseseed him or Ronnie B. That's our pull question today. Okay. Crackhead, nigger whore. What kind of animal? What kind of piece of redneck trailer park, or she's on Jenny Jones City? Okay. Be sure to check that out. Comes up with a comment like that. See, those guys haven't figured it out yet. This ain't Tampa. They haven't figured that out yet. And to show you what geniuses the Paxon people are, their show goes off the United Clock in Tampa on a station that they own. Paxon owns the station. They cut their show off at 9 o'clock in the morning, which was their home base up until, three, four months ago. Can you figure that out? I mean, how many Cubics your Coney is the half-to-by before you can figure what that's all about? 610 WIOT. Oh, Neil Roddy. What are those on your feet? Shoes? What else? Socks, pellet. Socks, KS. You just said kiss my f***ing incantanine. Oh, I'm sorry. Don't be sorry. Hey, what's that around your waist? About spell it. B-E-L-T. You just told someone to f*** off. In Zulu. Oh, my. And that's just one of the many techniques you'll learn with the National Profanix Language Cusset Program. National Profanix can have you cursing in Spanish, French, Italian, German, and a host of other languages in just a few weeks. So, call 1-800-F*** you today. Because the most important thing you'll need to know about other cultures is how to tell somebody off. Hey, buddy. S-O-C-K-S. Okay. Okay, 10 19 at WIOT. Here's a lady in Miami, hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. I heard you're changing topic for you today. What do you think about mandatory sterilization for kids from adults around WIOT for other more than three kids, the three different fathers? Well, how come your radio is up in the back first of all? I think they're definitely ought to be mandatory sterilization for trailer park trash. Do you think it's a fire-lake system, right? Did you hear what I just said? Yeah. Yeah. I think that anybody who lives in a trailer park first that we should do that by the end of the week. Sterely is everybody in America who lives in a trailer park. Sounds good. Did that's a good start? Sounds good. Then I think that anybody who makes under 50 grand a year they ought to be sterilized because they can't afford to raise kids. Right. Right. I think that what will happen is we'll form a commission and you and I can be the coach, Chairman, and we'll decide who can reproduce and who can't. Okay. Seriously, I am all four four sterilization. I think that if people can't pass if their IQ is smaller than their opinion, that those guys should be sterilized. Yeah, because they can't. Women who's IQ is smaller than their breast size must be sterilized immediately. Well, America's biggest problem is dumb people reproducing. Right. Dumb people making more dumb babies. Happy people don't even know who the father is. Right. Okay. I just want to get your opinion. Okay. See you at the trailer park. Okay. We have a daylines wide open here. Come on. We got a hot topic going here. They we get these peaks of 20 shares. If we get this one going, let's yank it and rip it and pull it and squeeze it and pound it. And bang away at it until they finally get pissed off about it. That's the way you work this thing. Okay. $9,000 for an engagement ring. Oh, that's a wrong one. Okay. Okay. Here we go. So anyway, sterilization. What do you got to get in the right page? I got my list here. Got my three by five cards. It's the Saber wasation of WIOD. Come on. 6, 2, 2, WIOD. We're going to have a wild day here today, man. 6, 2, 9, 4, 6, 3. 2 and Broward. 7, 6, 7, 7, WIOD. The purple mod, the mobile one lie. Whatever that thing is pounded purple at pound IOD. Let's hear it. $9,000 for an engagement ring. He wants it back. Should we sterilize him or what? Should we sterilize consultants? Is what I say? That would be the best idea. Let's bring back Aaron Summers. What I said. And really, you know what this brought is doing. She's doing like a watered down Aaron Summers thing without the effects. Are you following what I'm saying? It's like watered down without the sex. And there's no spots in there anyway when you come right down to it. So why not just shut off the thing at 9 o'clock. Sounds good to me. Here's Coconut Creek. Hello. Hi. Yes sir. Listen. I'm all for sterilization of trail attraction. Yeah. And as for your question about what kind of person could say crack had nigger hoe. Well, that's got to be one of them fish people. So consider a coach. Are you saying to me that she might be a born again Christian? She might be an assistant. That probably attending a prayer meeting at the Paxon headquarters today in Tampa, somewhere. Absolutely. Yeah. And what I want to say about culture. Yes. What about science? Don't start giving over my topics here, man. You're going to screw it all up for me. What about science? A science? Yeah. Science rules. Okay. Excellent. Number one, Coltson madness. Yeah. Well, the greatest cult of all. Yes. Christianity. Christianity. That's one cult in the world today. That's right. And his cause more madness. More murder, more mass mayhem, right? Absolutely. Then any other so-called cult. I think it's interesting. I think it's interesting that the mafia people are like very big in a Roman Catholic church because the Christian religion taught them how to give people off if they couldn't refuse. Absolutely. Right. And it melts in your mouth. Not in your hands. Exactly. I think you covered all 10. The price is in the mail, pal. Thank you. Nice job. Walter B. wrote over to see you. Okay. Let's go, man. It doesn't seem to be doing it. Six to two W-O-D and date. Come on. What do you think? Yes, you know. Up or down. Thumbs up. Thumbs up. Six to two W-O-D and date. 767. 9463 and Browered. We got all the date and Browered lines. Wait and I. God. This ain't working too. Good. This just doesn't seem to be getting the job done. Here's Pompano on a mobile. Hello. I'm here to tell you about the audience. It's dead. Just because it's peace on. Let's hear from some guy I'm today for Christ's Aix. It's not there, holiday. Let's hear from some damn guy I'm out there. I hate to deal with you guy I'm. I hate to steal one of your topics there. But what about the free food at the buffet for the old park? You'll be pleased to know by the way. I'm drinking two bottles today of life. Coacher water. Natural spring water. And on a repasse over. How do you like that? Well, how does water get to be co-ser? The rabbi comes in. Squared squirt does a little number in it. That's right. Neil, now listen. You can almost taste it. When the new smucks to buy your station here. I have never seen you know something in all the years I've been on the year. I've been on its 10 24 already. I have never started a show and seen I got you and one other stiff on here. That's it. I got two calls on a board here. We've got these hot topics and we've got to cover all 10 of them by two o'clock. We're going to be off the srs. Let's go here. Let's get the Gaia Monafone. The Jews are busy eating cardboard. Let's go. Neil, now when before you came over to your station. You're in Hollywood. Yes. I heard it was about not just from you but everybody about the pitch in the moon and growing about the equipment and that's been working. Can they afford a fact machine? Right. No, that was here. Well, didn't you got in there for the first couple weeks and everything was peaches and all it was was not. That was the first two days. We had no facts machine here that took weeks. We had no hanging file for the copy. I mean everything we had no paper clips. We had no toilet paper. They were telling Steve Nickel. You're the guy's got to go pick up the toilet paper and the paper towels. They had no idea how to put together a radio station. Well, do you think the new station is going to be any better? Meaning what? Well, I mean it's going to be the first couple days. Everything will be nice again. And then you'll have to do your step which is pitch all day. Yeah. Also in other words, we don't want it to be too good is that it? No, no. I enjoy your pitch. Yeah. Well, that's what I just said. We don't want it to be too good. I already told him that. Don't make it too good. Have a great day. God bless you. God bless you son. Let's see. This is very weak. You know something I'm going to tell you right now. I'm going to play hockey highlights for three and a half hours till 2 o'clock unless we get some real serious topics going here today. Unless we get you people off your ass. On you go out there. Are you a Spixon Dave County that are sitting back? Just waiting. Here's your opportunity. Arts and entertainment. Let's hear it. Elements coming out. Is everybody worked up about that? Like it's a big surprise. Like Martina coming out. That was a big shock to me. I'll tell you that. That would be like Charles Nelson Riley coming out of the closet on here. That would be a major shock to all of the world. Wouldn't it? Elements coming out. And Jerry fall well. Pithed off about it too. Okay. And so are all those other Graham. All those other Graham were busy doing each other and everybody. Anything that moves there. Don't forget. The ones that point the finger. They're the ones that are sticking at finger in places that we can mention on a year. Although we can say crackhead, nigger, horror on Iran and Rancho. That way I still can't get over it. I still can't get over it. The level of redneck is that that audience is all about. Of course they're all gone now anyway. So what's to say? Here's coconut grove. Hello. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Now that's coming at one water. Water is a try to, you know. We'll take the order of topics as they go. Okay. Just calm down. Here's a bokeh. Hello. That was J.R.O.Keech. Bokeh. Hello. You know, a rather run of gotta take what they can get. What does that mean? The depth of the audience. Yeah, rednecks. That's the depth. What's turning into their audience? Well, what do you mean that's what's turning into their audience? That's what's always been their audience. Okay. You're right. That's what's always been their audience. What's your listening to it, evidently? I think well. Are you? Don't sound like a redneck to me? No way. You sound Jewish to me. You sound Jewish. Are you Jewish? Hello. Are you Jewish? Of course. I know it. Happy pace off. I'm here. Thank you. Same to you. But I'm, uh, give, I gave up. I'm running around. How do you like that? Did I knew you were Jewish just on the phone? Is that pretty good or what? Well, just on the phone, I could tell you were Jewish. How do you like that? You have a sense? And you want to know why? Because there was no aroma of smegma coming over the receiver. That's why, George. Okay. You. Cleanliness is godliness. Don't ever forget it. You know. Yes. I'm going to take calls for 30. Okay. The answer is, oh. You lose. Okay. We have an open line in day six to two. We have, uh, all the Broward Broward still waiting out there. Can we find just a few Graham and Broward to get us through this day today? Oh my god. Paisach all over again. The worst days of the year is Passover time. You think that the whole town was Jewish at Paisach time. Put down those stalemates. I'm telling you, they'll kill you. Pick up something good like some mandal bread. Somebody brought us a mandal bread at the hockey game. Which game was it not the last game? Thank God. The one before that that we won. Broward is a mandal bread he made with his own little hands made from Matsah with chocolate chips in it. And you know something was pretty damn good too. By the way, final score tonight. Since we don't play all that well in New York, Rangers 2, Panthers 4. All your Ranger fans talking to Big Talk and a big talk. Big big talk. Open it up there. Big New York, Mouth. We're going to kick your ass tonight. Probably kick it again tomorrow night. Because I know we're not going to have another one of those coma performances tonight. Like we did the day just to make it kind of interesting. Okay. Just because we felt sorry for them. We figured we'll let them have one. Just to make it look good. 1028 at WIOD. 610 WIOD. The station that reaches the beaches. The kid we heard he off. Oh, hey. We know our limits. I have no force in. So kid, do you want to career in the Navy? What do you think you'd like to do? Oh, I don't know, maybe. Do they have a crew director? Uh, no. Why do you want to join? Oh, I don't know. Something about a Chris White Bellbottom uniform with us. Neppi little black tie and a Shirley Tipple hat. This says, I'm clean and ready for inspection sir. Do they have a food deck? I sure would like to play on that. That's a funny word. Food deck food deck food deck food deck. Please serve my ties on this ship. Oh, say, please. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I poop. Yeah, but. Okay, 1032. It's going around 1032 and WOD. Happy Tuesday. God, I feel great today. I don't know what it is. There's something in the air. It's paysaw. It's a teachers work day. It's going to be a great day on his show today. Even though there are a little recounts of training at the moment. I got some great hockey stuff. I got rich and right with the Sabers winning goal last night. I'm going to play all of that eventually when I get around to it when I feel like it. Here's a day beyond a mobile. Hello. Any other questions please? Uh, Sunday during the hockey game. During what? During the hockey game. The hockey game. Yeah, you know, that great game. Yeah. We was on the way to some friends out to watch the game and we were listening to QAM, right? Yes. In the car. And this clown that was on QAM says, well, we don't want to talk hockey today. We want to talk baseball. And hung up on anybody who want to talk hockey. Got him Clark or something? Never heard of him. On his out. He's out. Yeah. Well, he was history. He's out. Our second point came back in the Saturday last night. Got the list of this lovely broad life. I, what a dumb bro. He's better off with a gas cap routine. Yeah. And she must have read that little article that she was plugging out about 600 times. And, you know, an over and over again, okay, we get it on anybody cares. We move on to something else. Anything. Talk about boogers. Talk about picking your nose in public, huh? She's related to go to the same school as that gym, really. She's the girlfriend of our consultant. Oh, God. No, I'm going to get it. I'm going to put this picture together now, sir. I'm glad you're bailing. Walter Sabo has taken over this radio station. It was a bloodless coup because the pex and people bought it. They don't have the foggyest idea what to do with it or what it's all about. So here's Walter Sabo, Solama Billagudts. I'll come in and show you what it's all about. I'll show you how to make it into a bush league talk station. And man is he ever going to do it. Trust me when I tell you. Just write, key, right? WGVN Geneva never had nothing on us. You give him about six months. It's going to be dynamite. Sounds like Mike on me. Have a great day. In fact, this comes under one of the hot topics. Natural disasters. Have a happy. Okay. Happy Pesach. We want some goyam on the phone today. Damn it. Too many Jews on here. Go eat your moths. Let's find out what the goyam care about. Okay. We have an open line on the purple line. We'll talk to some Jews tomorrow. Let's hear from goyam. Pound IOD on a mobile one purple line. We have an open line in date. 6222 WOD. We have unbrouard. 7679463. This misconception that everybody who's a Gentile is somehow a trailer park trash type. I think that this is one of the gross test generalizations. What are you smiling about? Do you hear them? But holios don't live in trailer parks. Do they? Not as a rule. Can't afford it. Okay. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. I turned on WOD last night at midnight. To get some ball scores. Yeah. And I got him. He was on. ski was on. Yeah. What's the deal? I haven't got any idea. In fact, George who makes out the schedule. When I was asking him about it this morning, he looked at the kind of a blank look like. He was talking about it. He was talking about it. He said, no, not K ski. He kept saying K. He was talking about his wife's toenail. That she clipped and found on the. He found on the. Oh, wait. That's topic number seven. Yes, topic number seven. Telling out clippings. Yeah. And he didn't want to get rid of him. But he didn't know what to do with them. Oh, my God. Just lick him. Yeah. He kept repeating. You know something. It's you it almost be like a joke. You think it's a put on, but they're serious because this is what they've been brainwashed into believing is how you do it here. This is how they want to do this station. They're going to make it in a light bulb. Junior. Are they light bulb light? Are they thinking that people are tuning in and tuning out so quickly that they have to keep repeating the same thing over and over again? Yes, especially at that hour of the night. God. Beautiful. Beautiful. So what do you do with those toenail clippings anyway? I don't know. Let them fly in all directions. Or I'll get back. Have a happy. Bye bye. Happy a porom. Even though it's the wrong holiday, we don't care. Let's have some homotoxin to food as much better on porom time. And also a Hanukkah. Mobile one purple line is waiting on you today. Pound IOD. We have an open line in date. 6 2 2 9 4 6 3. One in Broward 7 6 7. We're inviting straight people and go in the call today. What you're at nearly there excluded of course. But we'll make an exception because it's a tough day. It's pays off. Maybe it's the day when the orthodox Jews there that embarrasses that humiliates. I find that so degrading or might be when I went to school to Michigan state in East Lansing, Michigan. And of course Michigan state is a state university. So the kids who live in Michigan get much cheaper tuition than those out of Staters. So there was a kid from a wassel Michigan. I could try to think of his name was Alan something. I don't know what his name was. Kind of like a real Yahoo guy. Look like a Yahoo. He was a Yahoo. But not a bad kid. But he was just a Yahoo. He was the good Yahoo. But anyway, he was from a wassel. And of course there were many of us from like from New York and from around Other parts outside of Michigan. Who were Jewish. And when he met me, I was the first Jew he had ever met. And he thought that there were going to be like horns sticking out of my head. And then I have pays like sticking down the sides of my thing. And have a been a soda at the top of my head. You didn't show him your tail, did you? No, I did not. I didn't even show him my. I didn't even show him my. But now that I think of it, and I wasn't that good. But at any rate, you know, this is and you look on a front page of the newspaper. You're talking about perpetuating ugly stereotypes like that crackhead, Nigger Horcom, and on Ron and Ron this morning. And here's these old ultra orthodox Jews, which I'm going to say it again. Nobody reads make one person out of a hundred is going to read the thing underneath the caption. They all look at the headline of celebrating the starter pass. And they probably think that's in sunrise. All of the people are read the sun suddenly. Take a look at that. They look at the picture celebrating the starter pass over. Here's the fire is burning. Here's all these getch keys with their big coats in their pay us in their big heavy hats. Look at like something out of the stone age. You're crazy, crazy, ultra orthodox Jews. You're out of your mind. And let me tell you another reason, by the way, that they're the ones saying how the only real Jews, they're not Jews. Because it's an oxymoron. There's no such thing as a conservative Jew. Not possible. Because liberalism is the essence. It's the bait. Forget about you. You can scrape away the gulfilterfish and all the moths of balls. Scrape all of that away. Put it over there. I'll have to be with it in a minute. But the bottom line is the fundamental liberalism of the Jewish code of the whole concept of Judaism. Without that, you can't be a real Jew. I don't care how close to the bone they cut it. You know what I'm saying? I don't care if you've been sliced so small, you're like an acorn, like some of the rest of us. You still can't be Jewish. So the whole concept of, that's like Jews for Jesus. Same same thing. Ultra right wing Jew can happen. Can't be. Sorry, you're out. Here's the mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I got a question for you. Yes. Now, I know fact and screw on you over. But I come running run. Had Betty boobs or something having a life sex act and they're worried about your program. That's so, well, you're asking me? How about giving me an answer? I don't know. I found out in a land. I found out in the last week that they're doing like live sex stuff during the show. I don't care what they do out of the show. But during the show they're doing like live sex acts on that show. And they're bitch about your court. And this man is supposedly a goodie a man of the cloth and goodie two shoes in Hallelujah. And don't say God damn on here and all of a sudden they're funny. Ballony born again bull crap that this company portrays with their Christian ethics and Emmanuel and everything. How can you, how can you do business the Christian way when you got guys having sex on here during a morning show? I don't know. I mean, after noon show. That's another story. What? I don't understand that either. I don't know why they're keep fighting. Well, maybe maybe one of those good Christians can answer it for us today, sir. Yeah, I think you should try to get some trying to answer that one for us. Maybe somebody out there's got a good head on their shoulders. Or just to stop us in your balls. Okay. I think you're good. You should go to WQA. I am going. I'm going. I'm on my way. Good for you. See you. Okay. I thought they're ready. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. I'm going. Open line in day. Six to two. We have one in brown it's seven six seven. The mobile on purple line is open, which is a bad sign. Powered IOD. It's paystock in course in the orthodox Jews. They can't call us today. Okay, nay I'm not really sure. the kipper I'm sure they couldn't call and certainly not on shop is but we're not on the on shop is anyway so what difference is a make what the shop is I don't know but

these isolated people if you listen closely you may just hear ah and just go get drunk we're worldwide baby w w w w w dot audio net dot com or w w w w w dot com and worship with us with 610 w i O D 16 W i O D you better be fawking be ready to play with the big boy I know I'm a Miami resident and I just just happened to hear a day meal foxo I'm a way home and I think it's absolutely horrible and I don't understand how anybody with values and morals or social conscience can allow such a thing to be broadcast on their station this guy is just cursing the people insulting last feeling just spreading anger and hatred I don't understand that I mean do you have children do you have the family do you care what's going on you know in the world here that that just that that should be going around someone just venting all their hatred and anger innocent people I mean he just let somebody crying on the sun the air and maybe it's very popular and makes a lot of money for your station but this is really not what the world means I mean things are bad enough I don't think we need a guy like this and I really find a very offensive and just horrible I mean how would you like if your children were listening to that and growing up in a world where this kind of thing is acceptable where people can talk like that and be paid for it and be endorsed I mean I'm just horrified and disgusted and I am sure I'm not the only person to feel that way please try and take consideration of you know the rest of the world and the other people that have to listen to this kind of garbage and I hope you will because this is really something that's not acceptable if you want this well it gets to be a better place it's not the way to do it all right who have to listen to this kind of

Soon or later you're going to die if you eat that crap. So anyway, here's some pretty interesting stuff. It says, proof that Jesus was Jewish. He went into his father's business. He lived at home till the age of 33. He was sure his mother was a virgin and his mother was sure he was God. Proof that Jesus was Irish. He never got married. He never had a steady job. His last request was a drink. Proof that Jesus was Puerto Rican. His first name was Jesus. He was always in trouble with the law and his mother didn't know who his father was. Three proofs that Jesus was Italian. He talked with his hands. He had wine with every meal and he worked in the building trades. Three proofs that Jesus was black. He called everybody brother. He had no permanent address and nobody would hire him. Three proof that Jesus was California. He never cut his hair. He walked around barefoot and he invented new religion. All right. Correctal right. What was that? Correcto. Oh, that too. Oh, got some good facts stuff here today. Some good anti-religious stuff. Thank you so much by the way. The more the mirror here from Nick. Who talks about the contradictions of all this, the Bible and all this hocus, and bullcraft and has got a whole great list of them here. For example, Exodus 20 verse 8, remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. But then in Romans 14, five it says, one man is steameth one day above another. Another is steameth every day alike. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. In other words, do whatever it had you want. On the permanency of the earth, ecclesiasties one for the earth abideeth forever. Peter, the elements shall melt with fervent heat to earth also when the works are that are there and she'll be burned up. Oh, add on and on and on. Here in Genesis, it says, I've seen God face to face in my life as preserved, but in John it says, no man has seen God at any time. How do you like that? And it's got a whole list of what 2,485 contradictions in all this biblical goblty group, but don't confuse these people with the truth because they want to wear all that heavy clothing. Save that for me, please. Okay. We have all the braward lines. Why don't we have a man kneel us on a year? He's like, fulmin at the mouth. He's ready to rock and roll and braward is not. What a shock. What a surprise. 767 Wiod in Broward are topic today. The hailed Bob comet. You like it or don't you? How about that tail? Anybody out there? One other. It's got a turntale. Can't be all bad if it's got that many tails. 767 Wiod. The mobile one purple line is open pound IOD. Out of town, the green lines forget about them. Even a golem up there in Palm Beach, you're all Jewish today because it's pace off. Here's Hylia. Hello? Yes, sir. Is this new? Yes, it is. Hey, Newman, this is the first time I ever talked to you man. You're the best. I am. Yes, you are. You know, I'm lucky to be listening today. I had to save home. Yeah, because it's a Jewish holiday today. No, because, you know, I was sick today. Is that a holiday in date? Oh, no, seriously. They have school in date today? Yeah. Oh, my god. What about your anti-Semites on pace off? Yeah. Man. No, but, you know, I was going to do the right thing. You did the right thing, stand home. Yeah. No, man, but, you know, I've been listening to you almost two years now. You know, you're the best man for me. Yes, I am. Say that again. I do the man. I don't know why people picture about your show, man. You. Because they can't deal with the truth because there are a bunch of mental cripples. That's why. There are emotional cripples. That's right. I know that's true, man. Well, can I put off somebody to speak? Go ahead. My brother Abraham and his girlfriend, Vicki, her bunch of two. Brother his name is Abraham? Yeah. Is he Jewish? Have a great day, pal. All right. Happy pace off. All right. Okay, we have a, here's a, Holy old with a brother's name Abraham. A, B, A, A, B. Okay. Open lot. No, his sister's name is K. In date, six, two, nine, four, six, three. We have Broward County. We're still waiting on Broward. Look at this. On pace off, no less. You're going to burn in purgatory. If you don't call me today and talk about life on Europa. If you don't talk about golf and Tiger Woods today, man, let's hear about Tiger Owen. Speaking of golf, by the way, another little contradict. I don't see Michael Mayo in a right and no column about this. About fuzzy zeller. Don't you love that name? Fuzzy zeller, another golf hole. He said Monday he was only joking when he was suggested that Tiger Woods not make fried chicken and colored greens. The featured dishes at the Champions dinner next year at the masters. But he says he'll apologize if Woods is offended. And by the way, Tiger Woods made some anti-dike comments in an interview that he didn't know we're going to be printed to. So while these golfers are nothing but a bunch of Barbison agoya. So David Halberstam just makes a little, a little comment that was much to do about nothing and people are trying to get his ass fired, which by the way, Michael Mayo still hasn't apologized yet. And Fuzzy zeller says something about colored greens and fried chicken. And Ron and Ron have got some bitch on here talking about crackhead, nigger hose. And nobody cares about that. I don't see Michael Mayo calling to write a column about that. Oh, this kosher water is killing me. Oh, God. Open line of day, it's 622. Broward County, last call and Broward. 767 W. I. O. D. We got the big game, the Rangers and the Panthers in New York tonight. Any interest whatsoever. Any interest in anything today. If I spent $9,000 on an engagement ring for my dog. And the Karen case swallowed it. And the ring, too. Would you take it back? That's the question today, okay? I had one in my mouth once. Here's Miami. Hello. Now. Yes. Come on, David. Let's get with it. I didn't want to get French or anything, but I'd hate listening to the phone. Oh, oh. Yeah. What's going on? Haven't taught you the law. I got a goddamn thing going on this place. This is dead as a door nail. We've got to wake these bastards up. Get some of these hot button topics to get these people going. But you get them pissed off. You're still in the air form to do the job. I'm going to be in the air form all day to day. I feel great. I'm finally over this crap I've had for 15 weeks. I'm finally all healed up and ready to rock and roll. And it's time they just can't do it. Well, let me give you some of this place is so dead. This town is so dead. It's dead. Isn't this a dead place? Yeah, kind of. God. But listen now, when I was when you were at their school for calls, I casually walked over and called you. Now, if you were to set the magic words, I would have ran and jumped for the phone. And Riké. Louise. Oh, Louise. You don't like Louise? You don't like Louise? Oh, what's not to like? Oh, Louise, do not. Hey, come on. You say I'm going to play Louise. I think that's what I'm talking about. How about Riké? I, Louise McGill. But you don't mind, and Riké. I think you got a thing for Riké. No, not really. But it's just like last time I told you when you had said, I'm going to start playing Louise McGill. Because somebody doesn't start calling. Yeah. I mean, I jumped. I'm going to start. I'm going to start playing Riké Raleigh, bits of people don't call. Hey, no. That'll do it. What station is, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, go ahead and we want to call. KFI. KFI. KFI. 50,000 watts. How do you call you, or let you know he's doing or anything like that? We talked to him on Friday. We called him and woke him up. Oh, really? Great. He's doing that. He's doing great. There's some assholes think that he wants to come back here. I got news for he's only here for those deposition and that stupid Brian Cox lawsuit. And once he gives the last word on that, he's on a plane and out of here. Anybody that gets out of here, they'd have to be out of their mind to come back here. I were a friend of mine. He was also a big nearly. He left from here to, uh, to Georgia. Right. And he loved it. I said, yeah, he made the big move and, uh, not too soon. I can't wait to get out of here. Oh, I mean, I can't. What a place. This place is a toy. The people are like about his friendly is a cobra. It was, what's up with that lady at night? I didn't do for a couple of minutes. I thought it was like, I thought, I thought, I heard that. The current came makes Erin Summer's sound like Walter Cronkite on a great day. Well, what, what? Yeah, she is unacceptable. But what do you put? What did you find her? How did you get her out of here? She's the girlfriend of the consultant, the Walter Sabos girlfriend. Haven't you heard her say that 4,000 times? I did hear you say that. There you go. Incredible. I'm sure that had nothing to do with the fact she's got the job, but just a coincidence. But she doesn't talk about anything. Yeah. She's got the hot topics, baby. She's got the hot topics. What do you think? Should she give the ring back or not? Should she give the freaking ring back or not? Uh, yeah. Well, this asshole spends nine grand on an engagement ring. Break up. He should get the ring back, right? Yeah. I think they ought to stick the ring in his eyes. That's what I think. Incredible, no. Have a great day, pal. Number one, dude. A Revitarchie. Right. Ciao. Now we got two open lines in day. We just can't keep the go and with it today. The Jews, they're busy. They're still doing their sater thing. They're drinking wine. They're passed on on a floor too much wine last night. From their big sater. If it was good enough for Jesus, it's good enough for them. That's what Bonnie said. 11 15 at WOD. Here's something that's good enough for you. It's family back. It's good enough for me. Let me put it this way. If it's good enough for me, it's good enough for you. Okay. If family bank, I don't want to sound like arrogant or condescending, but if family back is treating me great, they're going to treat you great. It's just as simple as that and they will. They don't care what you got like five dollars or five million dollars or something in between, which is more likely. They'll take great care of you and your money. They're not going to make mistakes every five minutes. And if they do make a mistake, they'll look corrected. Humbley like always screwed up and what can we do to make you happy? And here's a lollipop or something like that. They do actually occasionally depending on which color to get. They do stick a lollipop and your thing once in a while. Just because they're great people. They got seven convenient, broder locations. They got the lowest service fee and broder. They got all the features you want. They have a drive through that opens early eight o'clock at the morning every day. They're open Saturday morning even for your convenience. They have ATMs at all locations. They honor seriously honor. Pressed though. They honor honor. And you're just going to love doing business with these people. The old fashioned way of banking man. They get to know you. They treat your friendly. No big song in advance when you try to do a transaction. So fire your unfriendly big chain bank that treats you like a number in a computer. Say goodbye. See you. Give me all my money. See you later. Good luck to you. And head for family bank. They'll treat you great. Family bank member FDIC. 610 WIOD. When the Don is in town, She's not listening to us. Okay, 1118 at WIOD. We have an open line in date 6229463. We have an open line on a mobile one. Purple line, which is not doing too good today. See, when that line ain't doing too good, that should be like doing bioreathems. Like doing psychic readings. As soon as that goes out, it should light up again. Because everybody in their brothers out there driving on. I didn't see no light traffic today. Traffic was heavy duty coming to work. That was all right for me. Huh? But it wasn't lighter than usual. Just because it's pace off. Just because the kids are out of school and Broward. Are you telling me the kids in date have to go to school today on a Jewish holiday? Sounds to me like that mayor penis must be anti-Semitic, huh? The one that sold everybody out to Mickey Erisano just happens to be Jewish two by the way. I just thought of it through that in their for good measure. Just in case you didn't know that Alex, you two faced peace and turd. Mickey Erisano happens to be Jewish and his daddy, Ted, is over there in Israel with nine billion dollars that we ain't never gonna see no taxes on here. Here's a mobile in Hollywood. Hello. Yes sir. Are you being great? Rangers are gonna kick up and just ask tonight, huh? Yeah, I doubt that. Four two Panthers. Four two. No. So how many times? Four two Panthers. We have an open line in date. Six two two nine. By the way, get out from underneath that thing, whatever you're under. Okay, do you hear the way sound like Lloyd Bridges? Six two two Wild and date we have an open line in Broward 767-9463. Here's Opalaka. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. Science rules. What is it? Science rules. Science rules, okay, but we already heard that. You're the best. That's have a different perspective on it. You're the best. Yeah, we know that. Hey, question. Well, let's move down to the list, wait a minute. Maybe you can give me a quick comment on something. How about politics and scandal? Big hand in hand. Legal system. It sucks. Conspiracies. The way of life. Natural disasters. Can't help it. Gay right. Got to have it. Art and entertainment. That's the same thing. Relation ships in gossip. Go ahead and hand. I just, uh, animals asking were interesting question. That is that if, uh, who was it? It wasn't an atom. Somebody was asking an interesting question. That is the water Sabob, for example, Karen Keta. She have to give the show back. Of course. Okay. Okay, me a love you. To open lines in day six to two nine four six three gasping for oxygen as they can try topics. Just don't get the job done sweetheart. It doesn't get the job done. Because nobody gives a flying crap about some stupid little article out of a newspaper that somebody bought a nine thousand dollar engagement ring in dumb fork Texas somewhere where it canzes. Where it was. Nobody cares. Actually, I should know it verbatim by heart by an other whole article because she read it 65,000 times. Nobody cares. What does it have to do with the price of rice? How does that affect our lives? Why should we care? I would have to do with relationships. That's right. We're doing relationships without the sex. We're doing errand summers without the spice. Without the penis and without the vagina that we're doing it. Here's the lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. You're morning. First time call it a very long time with now. Neil, want to let you know just well talk about two things. One, the fact that brown schools are closed today in my son is home. Yeah. They're still a little bit bogus here in that it's a teacher planning day. They did not have the you know what to close the school for pass. That's what I just got through saying. If it's a golly of your holiday, if it's Christmas, if it's Easter or some does your holiday, they're closed for Christmas. Okay. But when it's a Jewish holiday, and we got to close up to pacify the Jews, then it's a teacher's planning day. It's a teacher's work day. The teachers went to the matinee at Highlight. It's something like that. Exactly. Why don't they have the cohorts to say it's a Jew day? Oh, absolutely. And better still my last comment last night sitting around first night's eight or family friends having a good. I like it. I like it. I like it. Yeah. Yeah. My rings. Hi. I'm from the Miami Harold. Would you like a subscription? Yeah. Tom Cox a hoist. I asked what I didn't tell them. And this morning, call circulation vice president and ask if they have solicitors on Christmas Eve calling the subscriptions. Right in the middle of well, you know their anti-Semi-Sederal anyway. So that proves it. That proves it beyond a shadow of the day. The only reason they let Bob Rubin and Howard Kleinberg stay on staff there is because they have a couple of tokens. Exactly. Well, go panthers tonight and who are two panthers tonight. Pisa cake. We're going to wake up tonight. We went into a little coma. We're waking up. They had some a pace of pie. Pisa Juan. It's a Morgan David. They'll be okay. Well, my surprise. They'll be ready to skate. Okay. Goodbye. See ya. So our poll question today is where do we find the chocolate moths? A book was having trouble finding that. Brook, by the way, will not be on tonight again because it's. It's pace Austin. She's real Jewish right now. She's looking. Okay. We have two open lines in day. Six, two, two. We have an unbrowered, two unbrowered. It's very weak. Very, very weak. This is always the worst couple of days of the year. Why do we have no gray men as audience? Are is the whole audience Jews? All those holios out there while a one guy even his brother's named Abraham. What does that tell you? Even our holios, there's our Jews. There are jubans. Six, two, two. Wiod and date. I'm going to play this Bob Kolt segment from the Edmunds game Sunday. It's about three and a half minutes. Great stuff, man. It'll blow out all the calls, but it's great. I mean, it's scintillating. The last couple of minutes there when Edmund. It came from down three, nothing tied it up. And then, of course, went on to win over time. Just unbelievable. Phenomenal. Gut wrenching. Tears your kishki's up. Broward County to open lines at Broward 767-9463. As we, we have an at a call in Palm Beach today. Have we hour and a half, not a call on a, ah, out of timelines. What the hell did the rabbi do? Scourge, Gordian is kosher water man. I'm gagging on it. Good, God. Not a nice Jewish scam here. Life kosher water. What's not to like? And these guys are real committees. Oh, we're having a good time with it. What does that mean? It's got a star of David on it on the label. Does that make it kosher? Does it have a little circle, okay? It has a circle jerk on it. Yeah. It says a little, does it have a circle you want it? Let's see. It says sodium free, big deal. Big Maccia. Oh, it says Big Maccia on her. That's what does it. It don't even have a little circle you want it. How do you like that? Fair. I think it's trif. Let's go to a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, good afternoon, Neil. When is evening to you? Hey, listen, I'm a new daddy. What I'm so excited to talk about it. Yeah. Anyway, just last lady, she reminds me. Whatever that means. I mean, we don't have anything for new daddy, so that'll have to do. Thank you. This last lady reminded me of what incident I had with my new, my new, newspaper delivery person, the Harold. Yes. I was sleeping very soundly on evening and at the 5, 50, and the doorbell rings. So I run downstairs in a, in a, in a, a sleepwalking stupor. Apparently, she had thrown the neighbors from newspaper, up and it landed on my roof, and she wanted me to get a towel for her. And the paper, too. Can you believe that? Unbelievable. 5, 50 in the morning. Incredible. I got you down. Have a good day, Neil. I just got a pound. See you. See you. Okay, we have a deadline. He's reproducing. Daydlines are open. 6, 2, 2, 9, 4, 6, 3. All of them. 6, 2, 2, 2, W, W. I think that guy gave me a good idea before Luis Miguel. Heaven hurt a lot of Luis this year. Too much and Reke, not enough Luis. I mean, we love and Reke at least I do. I love and dearly, you have no idea, but Luis. Exactly. Luis is so great. In fact, I was coming to work this morning listening to Luis during the middle of that show that I don't listen to on our station. And I was taken to myself, how come when he does his concerts here? The herald always has to do this obligatory review where they, you know, take a few shots. Or when he has a new album come out, they have to do. They take a few shots because they know that I am obsessed with Luis Miguel. And therefore, you know, it's the anti-neal thing. If Neil likes it, we got a knockout. Kind of like excess magazine new times. Same mentality. Same much as holes. Dave County, 622, Wiod, all the way. What am I doing this for? What am I doing this? Why do I go through this? I'm not even going to be here. I'm a lame duck. I'm not even going to be here. And I'm still pumping and pushing and Yankee and pulling and twisting. And with the numbers, too. I mean, the guy spent $9,000 on a freaking ring for Christ. I can't you make a comment about it? If you spend nine grand on a ring, what institution should we stick your ass in? That's the question. And if you brought that as an up is a topic on a talk show. Do you really belong on a year? No. There you go. 610 Wiod. Done in Mike. Blow. All right. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Right. What a pretty good Wiod. I'm going to have some more that stale Shamura Matsu in there, but it gets nice and hard like a brick on the second day and, uh, oh, man. It's great. Nothing like having it on a brick when it's going in and coming out. Here's some rise. Hello. Happy days, Achniel. And back to you, sir.

When you were talking about the snow globe. And so you called just for something for free? No. You already were on there when I was talking about it. I was already on. Well, that's what I'm saying. So don't pretend like now that we, you know, George is taking it home. I don't want the snow globe. Because George deserves it. Oh, I'm just mungum. I'm sure. I definitely don't want the snow globe. I'm calling from about the canther. I just munged on myself. Okay. My lot to do that while you're eating lunch. You go ahead. I want to try and get some enthusiasm going here today. I heard Eddie miss the plane. All right. That would be the best news. Tell me about it. Maybe he did. And you didn't see needle nose on the cover of cigar, a fish you're not. No, I did not. I heard about it. Oh, him and dad. They're all pissed off about it because they said that now he's sending the wrong message to all those little kids about smoking cigars. And I think they got a good point. Nice. No, and go a needle nose next to be doing chewing tobacco. Yeah, that's why he's only making 10 million here. Yeah, right. And can't chew the goal in the first five minutes, right? He's got to sit on the bench to get the hang now. Uh-huh. So it's taking him out tonight. I would say probably Paul laws. You think so? Paul's going to come back and give us little actions. He's going to spear them. Because I heard the coach said no fighting Paul can't you can't fight in the playoffs. Don't you understand? Sweetheart, you're very few fights in the playoffs. You can't get the penalties. But I don't want to see Billy doing all that crap. No, that was bad. And then the coach says, well, I can't knock him because we've asked him to step up to kind of play. But you don't leave your feet and do an obvious charge and further referee coach. You can't tell this coach nothing. You know, he plays his favorites. I'm yes. We know who his favorites are. And who are not. And who are not? And we're not who are going. Yes. Do not leave the left at last as often. Strock. Okay. Listen, Neil. Can you do me favor? Yes. For a little enthusiasm. Yeah. Because you are God. Little hockey night tonight. Oh, God.

The purpose of it is to have something to talk about. It's the stupid statistic for the most part. And it means how many goals are scored when a player is on a ice. Four and against the team at full strength. Penalty's power plays don't count. So when the man is out there and the teams are at full strength, six is side. How many goals are scored? Four the team while he's out there and how many schools are scored against. Is there any like a near award at the end of the season for this or anything? Yeah, there's the Alka Selcher plus minus award. Also, it's one of the all for the prediction. The Panthers won three to one on an empty net score by Savela tonight. And also, one of the if you can, can you play Star Wars Kiskin casino? How about Star Wars Cantina? Yeah. That'll have to do. Okay, well, have a great life. Okay, two open lines in day six to two nine four. So he just obsessed with that. Is he the guy? This one Julio, I think it's him. Loves that thing. Just calls every five minutes for that.

I wrote it down. What was that comment? Crackhead, Nigger Horan, Ronan, Ronan, is morning 9.50. Write that down in your diary, baby. Here's a mobile implantation, hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Great. That guy is crazy. The MGM is a leased amount from Bally's and the Aladdin's in between. Oh, the Aladdin is definitely right next door to the MGM Grand. It's like several end of flamingo is in between. It's down. It's on a corner. I don't know what the name of that's free or something. Uh-huh. They call it chop again a ball of ice. No, no, that's where the MGM is. I'm talking about. He's just right on the corner there. It's like about 60 yards in. They got an escalator now dragging it. Right. Yeah. What he was talking about? He doesn't know anything to his George. George has been in Vegas twice in his life. He's got all of us at three times in his life. And he's an expert now. I've been there three times in the last five minutes. When's the last time you've been there? Me? Yeah. Or George? Me? January. January 17th. The new hotels that opened up yet? Yeah. In fact, that was the day that New York New York was opening that day. And it was so jam packed in there. I mean, it was an incredible place. But we went in and lost a couple of hundred and ran right out. I mean, it was just hysterical. It was just too jammed in there. I'm going in June. You're loving it. All right. You'll take care, buddy. When it gets over, I'm going in about 20 times. Well, what's not to like? All right, I love it. I've been there about 20 times. I gotta go back every year. Okay, pal. All right, Neil. Good luck. Yeah, that guy called me for a good guy. But he's got his geography a little bit wrong. And you're trying to like squeeze all those places together. I'll tell you, you know, that Bob Stoopack place, whatever they call it. Now, it's changed about for that's in receivership. That's right next to the MGM grant, too, isn't it? In fact, free monster, downtown. That's right next to the MGM grant, too, I think. The Golden nugget downtown. That's right next to the grant. So, stay at the MGM because it's close to everything. I'll ride. It is a great place, boy, do I? And the food in that joint? The food? I'm telling you, I know it sounds crazy because I've eaten it. Hotels all over the world. And most of the hotel food sucks because it's not a restaurant. It's a hotel. That's not their primary business. It's a hotel. But the food from room service at the MGM grant is a hotel. But the food from room service at the MGM grant is just as good as any gourmet restaurant at which you have ever eaten in your life. And that's no exaggeration. It's great. Right? Right. In fact, once the restaurant, the rosewood grill rosewood grill is great. A lot more expensive. All of the food is not cheap. It's pretty expensive. But boy, it's good and delivery. They got 5,000 rooms in that hotel. 20 minutes, your food is there. We're even at 5.30 in the afternoon, the middle of dinner hour. And you're wondering, how to hell though they do this? Oh, by the way, that guy just fell on the floor that you had up on a wall. That guy with a heavy pecks just fell on the floor, George. Here's Hype a Luxo on a mobile. Hello. Great. Hey, listen, how can you tell George Bally does not on his trip? I found the sidewalk. You have to be a seizure spouse. Is his father's side walk to it's on his trip, right? But Caesar's face is the strip. Bally doesn't even face the strip. It's across from the library. Coach, will it be a beautiful hangout? How is that place? It's never been in there. Christ, no. You know, from the Italian restaurant. I call it the whole in the world. It's supposed to be really famous years ago. Right. I call it a place. I call it a place to barberick coast. Yeah, but Bally's just on a stripping. I keep him over. It's a bring you right. But it is not. Okay, see it's a technicality. Okay. But the point at the point he was trying to make is this guy's trying to say it's right next to the MGM Grand. It is not. It's way up the strip. It's toward the one party you'll add. And I close my eyes when I go by that. Now you take the Monorail. Do X and War. Do not go any ladden by the way. Okay. Oh, horrible. Now listen. Although they do have a good buffet. You'll feel like you're right at cemetery village. And listen. Let's go down a free much street. I promise. You've seen that's at 80 million dollar like show down there. Yeah. That's right. It still sucks. Downtown still blows. Downtown still blows. Huh? Yeah. There's four queens. I think there's a few more than four queens. A beautiful, well, Vegas. Now I'm going to make a cheap plug here. You wait. Go ahead. I jump in a cabin. There's a Guido driving. Yeah. Where would you go for? A full opposite. That's off the beaten track. He took me to a place called Chicago Jose. It's a house. All-nouse. Renovated two brothers. Oh, and maybe they serve 30 people at the most. Yeah. Beautiful. Where is it? It's a couple blocks off between. I'm going to tell you. It between the star dust and the ionosphere. You know where that's. All right. Next to the MGM Grant. Yeah. I'm going to have to do it. Okay. Thanks. By the way, oh, you know something? Well, the guy's still listening. We got to start it all this with his Vegas Cocker-Ri. If you want to place where the slots are great, go to the star dust. This guy just, I always went into the star dust. Why don't we ever go any place beside the star dust? The star dust is great. In fact, I got a machine there. A hate wire machine. I'm not going to tell you which one it is. You can't lose. You cannot lose. I love that machine. That machine loves me. I walk in there. I get a couple of rolls of dollars. I go to that machine. I stick them in there. But I'm being them up to 100 bucks. Like that. Just like that. Here's Carl Springs. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. What's happening brother? Great stuff. Great stuff. I'm having the best day of my life. Almost like it. Yeah. What's not to like? Nothing. Beautiful day. You're stuck in an office. Yeah, but it's almost over, man. Yeah. You got 10 minutes until you're out in the sun. I got a nice new Corvette sitting out there waiting to go. Okay. We have an open line. Oh, but I did. 6, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, you I, O, D. And one in Broward. He's seven to a bunch of bird crap on it. He's probably right. But tomorrow thank God is Wednesday. It's Carl Washington. So don't worry about it. You know, people like it all. Tied about people like Go out there and shoot pigeons. Let me tell you one thing. Okay. Even cats, which I'm not too crazy about. Cats don't dump on your car. Dogs most certainly do not take a dump on your car. Birds, however, they dump on your car. So anybody that's out there shooting birds for fun and profit be my guest. Okay. I mean, they're smart little critters. But if they're not smart enough to evade that. Exactly. Too bad. Here's Carl Springs. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Quincy, I'm right next door to the MGM2. It sounds like it. I want to do, uh, you're getting that gefilter fish thing. Yes. I wanted to know if you've ever seen the fish on the back of some cars. It has little legs on it and says Darwin inside it. Yeah. I love that one. That's great. Oh, okay. Isn't that great that intelligent people are combating all this bull crap now? Hmm. It's like, hey, either go, you can't write, you know, the Pope is writing both sides of the fence. I mean, you know, that's one or the other. I hear he's only writing one side, but I don't want to say which side. Well, that's all I call it to say to see if you've seen the Darwin one. I love it. Okay. See ya. Okay. Well, I'm going to give me a pull out right now. I'm going to go home and drop it in the bay in the air in the creek and fish for some of your filter fish for pay saw. How do you like that? I know how to do it right. I'm getting me a pull and I'm going to either that or do fish. I'm going to go over to that geophysic creek and fish for some of your filter fish. What other kind of fish would you expect to catch in geophysic creek besides your filter fish? God damn, or dang it, damn it. So anyway, listen, I just moved in right next door to the, um, GM grand.
