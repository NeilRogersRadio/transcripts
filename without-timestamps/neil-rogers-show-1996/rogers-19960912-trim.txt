I'm Jennifer Ram news talking entertainment radio six ten so Jennifer Rick wants to apologize I just want to say one thing okay and all the time you want the mark of a professional is not to make excuses I mean we're all human we all make mistakes but the reality here is four minutes after twelve he was supposed to be out of here ten o'clock this morning and he's using your show to make excuses for the deficiencies in his and that's really all I have to say it's unprofessional it's weak and it's getting kind of boring anybody have a heart or a liver yeah and that's it that's it you want to respond to what Jennifer said basically apparently she's criticizing the content of your show because you invited me in here no I'm criticizing you for spending the next two hours of your day exactly you can he said come on in sit down so you're criticizing me because I took him up on his invitation I think you're making excuses I think you'd be better off getting in your car and going home and working on your show tomorrow morning what I don't want to pull words in her mouth I don't think she's criticizing you for staying I think she's criticizing you for staying for the purpose of scapegoating the two two share in the morning yeah making excuses Rick in all sincerity your time would be better spent if you got in your car went home and prepared for a real show tomorrow morning with you get baby without slamming the news department without slamming Steve Nickel Bob Green Paxon or anybody else just do your job and so basically you can do that but I can I'm saying you're wasting everybody's time and I've got to go back to the newsroom and prepare the one o'clock see a Jennifer see you have a wet spot in your chair right now no I don't I'm just you unless you left it there because I you didn't drop anything no I don't you were just chopping it a bit waiting for you heard a finish the news so she could come back and we would have I do that frequently with her at the end of the news just like I did would you know the ten o'clock news when I asked her if she felt that she was responsible for the demise of our morning show on this radio station superb conductor yeah and you invited me in here but yet she criticized me what if I had said no Neil I'm not going to come in here what about it so then you wouldn't come in here why would I turn down the invitation you said would you please come in a sit down I didn't say please at all I never said y'all inside oh do you tell me down said you're asked down and let's say you're right and you gave a rather descriptive because you stood there in the doorway as usual and went through this hysterical routine about people sledg doors is and having fits in the newsroom and it were all bent out of shape and a place coming on glued as well as you know me I've never been hysterical about anything well as close to but not hysterical in the tone but just hysterical in mindset yes it was a hysterical confrontation you said you said you said you said you said you said you said you owe me mister yeah I said okay I'll sit down and then I said I'll be here in hour of course by any hello yes how you doing you listen to chronic yes it is I just wanted to let Rick know that I will not be listening from to six unfortunately I don't think a show is very interesting yeah and mister echo the other guy such is just echoing these little jokes you can hardly hear so you don't like their shows what you're saying don't like their show let me ask you this yes if we could get Chuck Meyer back if that's not going to help if we could have Chuck doing the news and bonding and interacting with Rick and Suds in the afternoon with that the sway you in any way no wouldn't sway me at all I'll make a note to miss you sir well a I'm sorry uh nothing personal I don't know you personally but as as your as a as a show it is boring you don't talk about anything uh once I've listened to you once and you were you were taking a consensus of McDonald's delivers and you spent 20 minutes uh trying to find out if any McDonald's in Miami delivers to your home and that's gotta be the most boring thing mixed sports I mean who the next next to sport the sports he up I'm sorry you I love you show but when you talk about hockey I don't listen okay well let's go be got rid of him right hey world cup tonight game number two eight o'clock in Montreal I'm gonna play hockey highlights for four hours it's the hardest to piss him off he's a chronic but at least he admitted in the beginning who cares about him you don't care about him you hit all I don't here's the lady in my in other words he's hard to please he likes me but he doesn't listen when I talk about hockey or sports which is a great deal of what I talk about so he doesn't listen very much and he hates you guys but felt compelled to call and be heard right an actress and I should have asked him if he likes Phil I'm sure he likes Phil okay so mark hoppins in the other room with dark glasses on waiting to participate in the blood bath he would like to uh throw in a couple of cents worth no it's here's thing we're gonna invite everybody in a building to come in today and trash somebody we don't care who you trash who you rip what kind of cost to comments you have what are you gonna get a great he said Greg Faiton is an asshole is what he said which I find very tempered remark Greg and I've always gotten along fairly well and he does covet that studio their next door and he does he does play a bunch of boss from time to time but asshole I think might be stretching it just a little bit as in breccomt here's a mobile in candle hello yes sir about what about what about break and that's in the morning yeah but your phone is like it sounds like what he would pick is got his thing in it he's got his wood in it yeah six o'clock in the morning when you're getting up and you're ready to go to work and everything you you don't want to hear somebody whining and mornin and grown and like we're quietly does all the time don't worry you listening every morning to know that I do that it's six a year I turned you off but I listen to my cranary yeah and how do you know I do it every morning you're wrong I don't do that every morning well every time I listen to you it seems like you're apparently the one you're picking around days I guess you're on your kids or your wife or you're out that's right and that's how come it can't be more like me and ever hear me belly aching or bitching about anything well I mean first thing in the morning and all you you're ready to get call what would you like us to talk about sir we'll start tomorrow oh sometimes you're hysterical sometimes you're funny yourself but yeah what what was that so okay well let me just make a note no wives no kids in that last time no McDonald's no one let me ask you something what about Chuck Miron sir everybody's got all their own problems nobody wants to hear you talk about yours okay let's read you you please thank you Leah would you please listen to me sir if we had Chuck Meyer if we brought Chuck into Marron or freight train I don't even know who Chuck Miron is this what I want to hear him okay see I think you're embarking up the wrong train yeah okay thanks pal thanks for the high marks I think you're barking up the wrong tree I don't think Chuck Meyer is the answer to your career the solvity or future I don't think that's Chuck Miron like Chuck he's a great news guy like I said how about best in the market I already I already went through that again you want me to continue with the peeing all over his leg and we're having a flood in here pretty soon but the fact is that having a great news guy is not relevant to whether or not people are going to want to you think people listen to how hard because they like the news on his show you know it's a majority of his show from what I've heard robbers always doing the news and he is always commenting would you say that robbing is a great news person no yeah and who used to do the news on my show on Zeta I thought he was great the bird right yeah I knew but do you think he's a great news news it was news like I'd never heard she for yes what we're all looking for oh oh I'm talking to this you don't know for the news like that yeah but I don't know why if he bringing Chuck does the news like the bird I don't know what no they chucked him do the news like the he just got to sing yeah I said it was innovative you said does Chuck do news like that that's innovative I said yeah Chuck do you do the news like the bird Chuck Chuck Chuck he'll cue up in a minute oh yeah he doesn't news like the bird he does so anyway welcome to bloodbath part one we try to think this isn't again this is like Chicago said only the beginning I don't you know I don't it's not going to be productive it's not useful but it's your kill some good time and the stimulates a lot of calls and probably a lot of people talking about this damn radio station again which is I think got to be productive even if they're ripping us an let's let's I'm a serious let's start our own damn self promotion here for the next the 18 days or whatever it is because we know we're sure not gonna get in from Cox for the smart key out front still says coast your way through the workday 97.3 coast this you don't understand no talk about bush league and on professionals you know that from the day this station was sold there has never been one mention on that mark he of anything related to the AM I'm very aware and including the dolphins which always were no matter what else was going on the world when there was a dolphin game broadcast on here with our 70 hour pre-game show it was all not that the mark he I mean nothing but geeks arrived on this road anyway but it's just it's just a symptomatic of the whole attitude that they've got is that the mark he says nothing about the AM I never well too low they get we get away from them right spite right how many years ago did I tell you that the operative word here was spite seven 12 14 at radio a spite W what spite once you'll grow that you'll never go back Rick and SUD 6 to 10 AM on news talk at entertainment radio 6 to W I O T another lie okay and I you know you know it you know that's a lie what when one was doing the news in the morning when he was filling in which I think he's a fine news boy you don't one a little flat and a little dead pan so in other words you're not you're not interested in having a good news guy come on Phil and have it a good here we go oh she's that's so much is it great yeah let's have Phil come in here and be the arbiter of this this is great okay great however so who do you want to rip besides yeah and do it in your own voice what I said yeah that's a bad thing guy really made me angry I didn't hear it I didn't hear it yeah I know he always taken shots and I was hearing too yeah he was taking shots and you did not defend us my friend Phil Hendry yeah part of the range shut down yeah exactly but I remember asking Bob because you would said to me I guess it was about a year ago you said you know we had very big numbers in the afternoon yeah you said you had sixes no you they never had sixes what are you talking about well are you in that delightful your part in 2554 you had sixes absolutely sir when in 12 plus we had a five nine okay I asked Bob he said that you were a liar about that about what that you never had Bob Green Bob alloo Bob alloo Bob alloo Bob alloo Bob alloo Bob alloo Bob let's go pull up the old books it's easy to find Barbara Green easy to find Bob we're green Barbara Green said that but yeah yeah how's he's great she's looking good she she told me that you guys never had those kinds of numbers yeah he's he's a bearer huh it's easy to verify whether we did I don't think you did either but you you may I think you're like embellishing a little mother would you but I first you start with a four that it becomes a five and it's the the passage of time you know it becomes a six let me tell you something I had a 12 10 thousand dollars if I got a five point one yeah I got a five point 12 plus yeah I got a five point oh they didn't give it to us yeah okay why have you that two are missed by a tenth of a point they don't give it to you we well plus numbers of five point oh yeah we had 25 54's what did I have in this sixes I don't know this right after Alex Bennett left this is like this is our first deal before we were actually even under contract that was our first book out of the hole second season we second book out of the hole yeah after Alex Bennett in a dump in in in in 12 plus 12 plus and 25 54 numbers were higher than that now and and I think you brought that up to take a shot at me no I did you know it I think that you were hurt by it's what they did you know it's very often at his numbers and they have to know we're better than you are I know you have a great book I had one book in the winter of 95 and it was it and that we still just you know it's a great talent without a book no that that's the truth well I mean that's the truth though in my target demo I always I hit number one six out eight books in our target demo which is like men which you know goes to show you smarter than I am oh I mean that just that was the story if I had the bonus based on men I'd had my bonus every books since I've been here for eight years but being a shmuck and being easily influenced and easily caught oh you don't need an agent you don't take a yeah we want screw you did the guy ever call you by the way that no that's guy contract tampering did when's he gone I don't know but he spoke of you highly yeah done buckwall spoke of you our buckwall speaks highly of you and and Mitch Dolan the general manager at WABC and Johnny Dolan and Johnny Dolan right now with a crank call what it Bennings and say is to be that I've set you it didn't upset me and upset Adam I did not hear it what it Bennings and say oh that crap about that he was on while you were an afternoon or even more crossover well there would have been more cycling running audience to have to know is yeah I didn't hear that yeah I didn't hear that part about how the morning the morning audience oftentimes turned their he also ready or the part when Margaret was on a few days ago ripping me for too much for the hockey hockey hockey or whatever was he was ripping into about how I was a gentleman he doesn't like us he does she hates me because I'm a guy of the fact that Phil's going to L.A. she's not staying is she because I'll be glad to see her girl he's gone yeah okay she's gone then you know something I am jealous of the fact that he's going to L.A. not but I wouldn't want to work for this company there you'd want to work on Los Angeles what have I told you you told me you hated Los Angeles I do why would you work there why I mean there's only a city here there yeah exactly good place there's place there's place there better place you can hide there I don't have to live like in watts right you don't have to look to see if you can see the sign every day and find your way home I have conveyed the same sort of it have it I yeah that's right we can we do there can we do a break I wanted to ask you question well I have never got gone beyond why have you never broken out of Miami and done what you should do and that is go to a one of the top five markets are you again trying to lure me to break my contract with the packs and people I think I think I think I know I say this about reconcers too I think that you're you're deserving so in other words you would like to see is a total disintegration of WOD with that it would that make you feel better in other words then then you can tell you then you can tell your grandchildren say you know when I left that place it went in a crapper man it's just completely integrated let me ask you something do you have more of the break please I think I can because it's 1222 in WOD news talking entertainment radio 610 WOD okay 1225 thanks Chuck so let me ask you a question do you think that Chuck Myers the answer to the reconcers you're starring Chuck Myers yeah we used to feature Chuck a lot like your show of show is featuring said Caesar it's tough to prep a morning show in it I mean seriously because you get up and would you please get on Mike please right here there you go yeah but that's a question I always wanted to ask you and why you wouldn't bust out oh that's right we were back at market envy because I know it was made a lot of good career decisions well actually when I was still doing regular talk when I went to Nashville when I left the WNWS and I went to Nashville at LAC and I was a disaster for a month with those pickers I thought I gotta gotta out of here and I I had a deal with WWDV and fill it fill it right and I was going to work for them Jerry Williams was there and to Irv Holmer and those guys and the day that I was supposed to leave I went into say goodbye to DeCasper and he sweet talked me and it coming back down here to WS News and so my furniture all went up to Philly and I came back down here and I had to wait like a week to get my furniture back but that's and I've had all kinds of chances you know the ABC people were enchanted with me and what's the guy who like it was Walt Sabo that caught a lot of people. Well they got a thought crow was the Sabo higher dust for waxing did he yeah well he's consulting Kali well he's the one who put the guys on a KFI and he afternoon and it was supposed to be like Rick and Suns that's a Sabo for fun. The John and the John and Kenia which means nothing to this audience so we ought to get back to it. Well I would you want to go somewhere and see if there's nothing to this life why do you want to leave it I'll give you an example Jerry Williams in Boston. How long has he been there 30 years? Maybe I remember I heard him in 75 when I was in up there at least 35 years okay came down here to WNWS for a year out of Boston. Right hated it I mean he we had a gigantic book we had a humongous numbers I think he had a six four I was on a night I had an 11 something and Alice Rantel had a five or we had enormous numbers they were all old of course because of the you know kind of talk but he hated it here and got mugged on the air the last night before he left I was on the air he came in a say goodbye and then he walked out into the hallway there were two black guys out there who would who mugged him and they're running around the building and he comes in clutching his neck and they've yanked off the chain off his neck and his watch and I don't know what he's talking about and I had to give out to somebody please call 911 on the air on the air you never heard that was in the radio station yes he got mugged in the station and it was like this it was like a room the studio was the room there's only one way out there's no windows no place to go and thank God that they never read idea and somebody yelled out hey it's a radio station and which they had no idea what the building was because it it looked like an office building you know little whatever and so when they found out that we were on the air they panicked and they ran out and that was his last night he was he came in to say goodbye on the air got mugged in the air back to Boston and he's he's still on our keel and I'm assuming he's still doing great there so the the answer is that sticking around in a market for many many years you're doing well yeah and you can develop it and that doesn't go away I can answer for that he's got a mind like a steel trap for a memory he remembers people it weren't even born so you know what that makes you my little cow indigenous you know everything about everything about here you've been ever so many some years but you you bring up people in history that that you know somebody always can identify with because you've been through it all so what is that for the memory nobody cares about my immediate our audience cares about nothing nothing can be read nothing can suffice for time and if you went out to Los Angeles or New York you wouldn't be as adapted as you are to hear to know you're a gigantic in LA I'd be I'd have 15 years but you wouldn't know what you're talking about for a long time Boston I'd have a 30 year do you know how weak the radio is up there they got front hot stations up there too I terrible yeah weak don't why don't you go because you hated here you love Boston I would think that would be the reason now because now you know everything how's the time yeah now's the time to break out this whole bobbed you how much did the Beverly Green paid to come in here and try to uh I just walked in because I was enjoying it I walked it up to see 58 guys standing in the control on the whole radio stuff oh yeah stop doing business listening to this yeah and I had to just this is just a preview of things to come and the best of is after we find out for sure you're out of time your train is love to track no and then then you'll really open it up in my mind yeah I know that I know what's going to happen we're not saying you need to turn out the air conditioner after Jennifer got finished with me yeah she got man yeah always just let me have the same thing I used to be great we'll say that after you've gone and you used to be great yeah you were never got the numbers of Rick and Suds did but hey you know how to everybody can well let me ask you this okay this is a good opportunity okay you heard a lot of his show in the afternoon not recently because his mind is blown but like during the first two years well know you know that that's true I wouldn't say that I say that I'm trying I'm you're trying this is this is a this is a summer and this is a season that is a difficult yeah I'm to work everybody knows right so I'm doing different talking about the house in days of your show the first two years when we were all being in our pants and uh and what would race down to the car to get into the car just so I wouldn't miss a minute now would you say that your show Rick oh and they have to know forget about the numbers was better than the show that Phil has been doing an afternoon no you can't say that you can't we can't see what you do we can you know exactly what I'm doing totally different idea it's absolutely absolutely how do you make that subjective judge you the only thing you can do is judge it's just just a minute if I brought you in a slice of pepperoni pizza right and a piece of dog crap okay and I said taste both of these even though they're entirely different okay and I said which one tastes better you probably would say the pepperoni pizza even better upon what I was used to eat it still a matter of opinion if I would like to eat fine people that would say Phil is much more hilarious than you guys will ever be and I could find I had a call to this morning I said Phil is the greatest house ever been on a radio station and um he hates you and I'm just uh accepted I could find great right we could find our people that love each one of us and hate everybody else so what I'm saying just the only way you can you can gauge it as objectively and that is if you had bigger numbers than me in the afternoon it's quite possible that you belong at a different time different time different things what here's talking the game no let me say it so I think it would be great for more three years ago right I would think you would be great I wouldn't be good for mornings at all I did mornings for many years I I can't do it better than I can't I can't do mornings better than us let me tell you one get up in the morning and I can't for all of the stuff we're here clocking a morning you like like Neil Neil features Neil okay Neil doesn't need any callers he can go on he's very interesting you don't callers there you go like not permitted and just be quiet okay listen following you it's a good thing I don't Phil Phil can get by without any callers because you can you know you feature you whatever your talent is that is featured whether it's being whoever you want to be whether whatever it's you I feature the callers I feature the people I give them a forum just a little bit you sit in here with such you of the three of us the only one other than Phil's characters you're the only one and has a sidekick right such that if we don't get any calls we're dead such an eye you don't need calls you got some quiz laying sitting in here that you can play off of all morning long does it mean it's that's a fairly entertaining well that's true okay I want to be the one to say what I am saying is we feature the audience in the audience if you give them and what about Chuck the right for him we used to feature Chuck oh I have so the oh it's right two and a half hours and we figured out the audience has replaced Chuck which I know he's a big guy and it's always been over she's doing could probably like you know the audience people the seats of people of your audience people look forward to Ted people look forward to you know whoever the audience has always been our show yeah we have a neck of allowing them to do what's the water we just uh my don't we just automated fill that we just let it up on them hangs up on who if they get going fill sit yeah let's find and hangs up on them if they get going with me I say okay go what what do you got going in other words what you're saying is you treat the call is better than fill that we just let's see look at this well it's the one you exploit them and get something out of them like for example when Woody called yesterday morning I said oh my it's Woody and just sat there like a cause you did what after you he was going after you and I did the same thing you're doing to me right now letting people go let him somebody else to it but I'm exactly and I want it no you're letting other people doing your sit back you got a full board of cars you love it if it's what he called right now and said anything he'd be gone in two seconds well that's your thing see I think that Gilbert is uh you keep stressing Chuck Meyer I think that Gilbert is somebody ought to be thinking about his part of that too too okay he's dangerous that guy he's a ratings killer he's a fast man you'll remember you were doing ratings who was the first person after I finally dumped Gilbert after we you know we had exploited him for the two minutes worth of entertainment and abused him as much who's the next person that decided to pick up on Gilbert come on me no before you I don't Rick Alex Bennett no yes I didn't listen to Alex I couldn't he did anybody else and that was one of his first mistakes besides setting foot in his town I was nowhere was uh using Gilbert I was nowhere and doing the whole thing with the feet and with the government people love Gilbert I find him a sterico it's banished not on his own managed so are you saying that Gilbert is going to be part of the afternoon show you know everything I say he says sorry you know I'm trying to get out of here but I'm not going to take anything for granted I'm trying to find out if you are going to ever wise up or you're going to continue using Gilbert as a crutch you know exactly he is not a crutch yeah as long as it's entertaining whatever it is it will be featured on the afternoon show as soon as it ceases to become entertaining in my opinion it will be gone so in other words you're saying Gilbert is going to be on the show as long as anything that's on is entertaining yeah what it seems to be entertaining it will be off yeah you you you you you you you said to me many times it's such can't stand getting up that early right you don't like hey he hates it right right he is doing anything if it's not in front of it you guys we're not going to ball out of the park there and afternoons and that's the place for you to be and one of the things is about bothering you well yet is he he's doing it even he's doing it in his voice he's taking a brutal shot at you and he doesn't want to cause no to show it is not why don't know why it's a brutal shot I mean you would say that you have a two two why you would say that you had a failing rating I'm not saying a failing though let me be really arbitr with us okay in other words we're going to decide because they had better numbers in the afternoon that you have had overall okay yeah which is the better show okay and I would be I can you say that that's like saying you have an orange better I just got to tell you with the example of the pepperoni pizza and the dogtor that's right and the station did have better numbers well then you have to say that they're right you did a big one no station had better numbers right the station overall right exactly so we say let it all I'm you saying that like what if I was not like right why so everything is my cranieri what's like a over into rick and suds well not only that rick and suds were following me now let me ask you were my number is bigger than yours or yes bigger so however wait a second why don't you want to act in a look lucky we're inheriting a gigantic audience right the number one audience in the market we kept them you kept all of them you am wise afternoon drive time times but listening which you know is a combination of both is much less than the afternoon yeah and there's nothing you'll ever do to combat that I mean for less than what does fill it's less than what days it mid days they part of he's got a huge kneels got like an eight hour or ten I've seen it like ten and nine hour to yourself and that's unheard of but that's you you could have that in the days people are coming on I was on mornings in Zeta you didn't have that not nine or ten what you didn't have nine and that's not because they like to show is just because of the uh... by was a by product of the week to have five times spent listening in the afternoon five hours which is pretty damn good yeah but it's not because of the fact that it's not which afternoon show was better was it more enjoyable or it's not a very good one it's rick and suds because if you had more success there then you obviously you know if you had a bigger audience there than obviously to more successful show plus frankly I think that you do better with your advertisers than I do I think uh... I've got a credibility problem with my characters wherever ties with a freak out that nobody's going to believe what I'm saying when it comes to a live spot you know okay and you and also the thing in the anaya certainly and and uh... i listen to uh... you know i listen to you you go out you smooth clients better than I do all of this is new to me when i've been when i came to w i i never ever had a time never had a time right i never had to talk to a salesperson before i get which was a shock yeah well okay let me give you a little something in reverse right so since we have been on afternoons there was a census that came in that changed the entire rating system and the numbers for the station have gone down because the Hispanic numbers when they took the system out of the last trend filverance through the roof and last trendy went up to a four i had about a five five in there and uh... we had a good trend i think we had a good month but i'm expected we're talking about the nineties when we used to be on afternoons and it was a different census which the numbers is the numbers the nineties still the night the night the night the night the night the night the night the night the night the night i met the nineteen ninety census and when it came to nineties no i we all did our numbers change and i think went down with the sentence well i hope ten of the birthday of this because man what i'm trying to pay him a compliment it was but then what you're saying is is that i think the dollar we had bigger numbers and afternoon drive is really an inoperative statement because there's a whole lot of it so i know we're not all of you but now that we're operating within the same time frame right it'll be interesting to see in the next year or two absolutely will compare every time a trend comes out also a well fill had a four no well i don't have a rick-and-subs are starting off with the two one in the afternoon fill had a four you left him a four whatever will never last be so right and you're you think that's fair because it's the same as we're in the again nineties now right okay sure absolutely okay 1240 a wild it's the end of the summer if you've been waiting for the best time in the year to buy a new toy or your weight is over by the way Eli came to me in a haul this morning and he said uh... bababa bababa bababa buying a copy and bababa i said Eli no matter what the story is with a copy no matter what the agency tells you no matter what mark jacubs and says you're still an asshole and he said okay i find it what a what a you're one your wow okay 1242 a wild do welcome to our blood bath so what is the facts have to say isn't it a constant facts it's it's from south you know him no but i know the handwriting wreck why don't you admit that you are just bad and boring the two of you there's nothing interesting to cheese man i'll be really old i can't read i can read it and then there's nothing interesting to listen to on your show signs south yeah okay so he likes you yeah so there's the deal in it and when the trends come out every month i'm going to put like i'll take feels last number now how's this going on it so you'd know what it's been always this going to work by the way well you got to compare it book to you know annually to annually so you think it's time for me to get out how what you saying frankly i think and i think the audience would agree if they were if they were going to be honest yeah and i think and the audience would like me to get out is that's no i think the audience knows that you guys are better uh than Miami that's what south said yeah well south realizes that you're well he's saying your show is that well it's not close for Miami oh i'm not no no there is no sale okay this is this is the same handwriting and see you dignified this if you would have showed it up to me close for like years it's the same handwriting with a variety of names and just and it's always negative and how come you're a ripping q a m and nobody else does that and you're jealous it's just it's garbage i don't even read it okay but anyway yeah i think that a lot of things might not what asked the question you know why are you not in a bigger market and that's and that's my question because i've been lazy because it's not no seriously it's very i don't do any show prep i don't like any old days i used to do all i'd reading and research and guessing i just want to win here and i have a couple of things written down and that's all i do and it's very acceptable it's lazy in terms of how you approach your show but you mean in terms of how you approach your career the same way yes so you're not as good as you it's too much worse when they talk me out of having an agent they figured at that point well he's that we know he's not going anywhere we got him for as long as we want when bob kneel said in there with your friend bob alloo and said yeah we want you to retire with us about make the deal if you want to make it up for ten years fifteen years what and that's that's a true story yeah so make make the middle deal for as long as you want because we want you to work uh for w i would do until you croak something like that or until we make you croak and they're working on until you're croak so i did it without any agent with any advice with that and that they manipulated me to that position because i'm weak unlike you who finally after a better late than ever wise up and got yourself an agent and still going to win a working for cock but yeah see you're talking all at least you're going to a great market in a big radio station but you're still working for a horse crab company which i know you can't comment on but you know it's true they fired honestly me a little bit don't you in Atlanta yeah they did fight a mark right in fired me in Atlanta yeah GM and Atlanta fired me that's true yeah when i was in Atlanta uh i wasn't they didn't give in you know i don't like rods no you're backing in this market whatsoever they haven't their hand i'm like us no no but seriously but wait a minute they like him they hate us i'm a patty and he asks you forget it all together they hate us but they like him and they still haven't done anything for them that to me i mean if they like you if they love you and they still won't let the finger to promote you that gives us a little bit that's it you guys it was not a promise to be in the beginning in the beginning when i first came here we had a new we had a son we had billboards we had the great campaign but since i got here they haven't done that's another thing you're talking about the haven't done for anybody we had the numbers with a billboard now you did the numbers without to be but let me see maybe you're here you're a new kid here you were new kid on a block nobody in my me had any idea who you were they didn't had never been exposed to your act whereas he was on waxy i've been here for twenty years so they could always justify well i we didn't need to promote those guys they got their own built-in qm nobody knew from fill Henry and they also probably think well it's just gonna sell like a make him excuses then if i say well why should Rick be the only one yeah it's all i'm i'm just saying that it was a uniform black of the kind of promotion you're talking about they did do a TV campaign in the spring in ninety four and they brought it back yeah uh we had two golf tournaments which you're a thing right there one of these what's mine right in front of you there yeah he's poppin he's starting to pop in the room screen we had a couple of golf tournaments which i think they promoted pretty well you know yeah well no they did how about the trip to Ireland they did that on your behalf oh my god Phil Henry turns into a corporate suckhold oh he was my fault the trip to Ireland they ran around telling everybody it's because you have no credibility everybody thought it was a put on i know the guy who booked the trip by the way the guy in LA no dot no the guy your listener guy the one guy who bought Robert said i think he bought two or four of merciless i got a letter from the guy in Los Angeles who was who was uh doing the trip and said we had a number of phone calls a curious thing people were asking where you kidding yeah i like a hundred phone calls people don't know if it was a joke or not tonight i don't think people were even aware that Neil and i aren't here it's just you that that was um that was the the first time did you get i also that was the first time that i actually learned how to do us all now while we we're talking over each other which you so where would i go in all i want to hear more of this career advice on a year new york is the obvious place if you got all that he's ready to have these so cold tell it like it is host in New York and i can't say i've never heard lincamials but they have that the you know the bob plant and everybody in your bob brand well the so called in your first uh this man's been dead for twenty years that new york has the new york has got the flexibility and the and the the calis skin to really enjoy your show you know you guys are perfect for lunch what what what is the benefit for him though so what you're saying is that l.a.s. too laid back which is what their famous for they would never put up no not at all not lost angeles to be great for you you know i just a lot of things now you're gonna be more of your kind of a lot of facts in New York New York is more of a new in in block is northeer the northeast is more of your kind of a block is a benefit of New York uh larger yeah is it money you've got market well in New York you've got you've got every indicator and every network in a world sitting up there waiting to just put your weapon up and down here who the hell ever hears people don't hear you you've got all your huge Miami audience that hear you and a love you and a would not hear you're missing my point but i'm talking about an interim you've got people in the industry up there by CBS ABC I sure one all these other companies that are gonna sit there and all of my amys up and coming look at the guys who have gone to New York or to Los Angeles who with in five seconds got a television deal market brand yeah you guys with a five second we're out of a television brand but they got a TV show at NBC didn't they for a day mother love goes out there for who's it's Stephanie Miller does a night time show a kfi she gets a TV offer to go to fox oh yeah love was the same thing all of these guys all the same lot they mean they're already there huh they're already there they're all in the same lot radio TV it's all one lary about you've got some talent you go out there and you can make something really happen as opposed to getting excited over the first TV gig and not having it so in other words what you're saying is instead of like planning for the 30th of September going to work for the past and what we ought to be doing behind the scenes is talking to all these agents in New York and plotting to get out of here and just guys you know what we can talk about you know what it might be of years ago in between radio jobs I was I went to work for snowling and snowling didn't what they are no snowling and snowing is that implements and an employment agency and what they do is they hire people that they can't find jobs for and you sit around and you pretend that you're going to find jobs for other guys and you see you read the one ads in the paper and you call these people up and you try to get their permission to have a listing so that when some guy comes to you you really comment in the believing that you're going to find a job and of course you never do so anyway it was during the Thanksgiving holiday this is a true story there were about six of us who were the counselors and the the boss who's got to be dead by now but anyways name was George was this old bizarre really weird guy and we had one young lady who was working for us one of the counselors he was getting these crank heavy breathing calls at home you know you know this stuff and one morning at the seriously at the meeting I'm just wondering where John I don't want to the boss pops up maybe it was John the boss George pops up and says hey Susie you're not getting any crank calls like we are you sure story nobody ever told him she was getting crank calls but somehow this boss knew George yeah well he worked to phone a lot so anyway we all all six of us because the pay was like minimal at best and the guy was an asshole it was just a total scam and so we decided that we were all going to quit at the same time and we did and we had the holiday weekend for Thanksgiving and Monday Monday and the guy walked in and we're all empty orifices every desk was empty there was nobody there and he had a people sitting out in a waiting room waiting for imaginary people to find them jobs who didn't exist and you was your thing is we should do the same thing the pack is that what you would like us to do with that make you feel better I'll tell you what and I'm being very honest that we know that things people would like we can talk about car you will pay the agent of cox enterprise now you try to sabotage the sale of the radio station no because you know the the truth is that in cox would admit this could the cox does want to talk to agency there you know y'all they hate no company does you know yeah and I don't think that my agent has any better relationship with with cox I have mine everything I have an agent they won't talk to him I had to negotiate my own deal is still pay my agent yeah that's how it's hard yeah exactly the way business business goes but I still have my guy talking to them about a side syndication deal if and when that happens but anyway the point is we can sit and talk about companies radio companies down to the years light a talent and we know this sometimes you work for better guys and sometimes you don't but the time has come where you have to seize the moment seize the events at the tide of Shakespeare said and to what you think is what you're saying is and all I had to do is I'm here I'm here I'm here like this is a lot of this a guy I'm here because I did the big off-back weekend by four months now I've been here this from you off the year I'm glad you know that what you have to do don't you understand I have a contract now do you really think I mean your contract your contract got two years left three three years in two months see guys we're gonna go she's a plan to work being they planned on you being dead by then if you remember the memo that came out it was posted on the wall we have them for lying any company and saying that you need to go to a meeting with a person in the other words either you're gonna pay me more I'm not coming to work is that what you're saying I would think that to the time would be opportune to renegotiate with a new owner would you am I am I wrong with a new owner would you think that it would be a proposal how can you do that you can't play very very very sweet we're walking in but let me ask I'm excited to ask you this question is it possible that I'm satisfied within the confines of reality in the this market that I'm satisfied with how much I'm making I think you satisfied with how much you're making I think that I think that you deep down desire a larger piece a larger task industry that's right I would like to be able to talk to living in Boston New York LA but when you work for Cox broadcasting they put you on here and keep west on a station it's got the towering on a ground it's not on it's right that's not can do and then they put you on for my recommendation that's never shown up with one diary in the art front and for my or not and then put you on S.U.N. they put a due flag from upstate New York on here in Tampa with a bunch of red decks it's not conducive to enhancing your career that is that's you're in your mind right you're you're so in other words leading a lot of stuff you think that S.U.N. you can think that the tap of thing is is known across the country and he'll run just as not as is not a marketable product because he didn't happen to know that's not what I just said I said that putting us on in those markets wasn't conducive to creating what you're talking about we never had an opportunity to have a well-being but we're talking about one you know we're talking about there's a lot of different companies why there's a lot of different ways to do it what he's trying to say is headed button done well then maybe you know maybe not we'd have a chance they can't or it's not on Tampa by the way right I miss is and I miss has like fractions there yeah marginal number so what is Tampa prove Tampa proves nothing we actually have like all radio mark absolutely or it's a really awesome right next state red neck and if it's a funny thing for a radio station like Wiod to succeed as it has in a market in a city where there's one comedy club the comedy scene here's not supported at all there's no local comics I mean they're out in the only comedy club that's open is out in Westbrook I don't even know what city it's in any comedy clubs do well yeah manyapolis of all the rotten what you don't want to get on the side that's right but I mean Chicago and those people with a great sense of human there I'll tell you what they've got they've got seven or eight great comedy clubs Chicago New York DC LA San Francisco comedy scene just just blossoms in those places and here's here's Miami where there is people seem to be humor impaired you know you are just humor impaired speech the language well whatever so I mean the point that I'm making is that there are larger horizons and as a member of the American Federation of Television or radio artists these all are you doing a tournament are you a very a phase and which is a very a very a very a very a very a very a very American fact that's why you want me out yeah are you know you not remember you're not you know I could join them now I am that's not a problem dormant they let fags in dormant door for five at Wiod a two-in-oh and guess who's next the jets beautiful dolphins on radio news talking entertainment radio 16 W-I-O-D Light McRae House yes just cat miss it news talking entertainment radio 16 W-I-O-D so the deal is we're all going to KFI we didn't want to pack some people to know but we're all going to be leaving on the same bus and we're all going to LA good it's going to have track wouldn't that you would feel better about that you feel like like the Linus in the city stay in the company I think and the long-year stayed with Cox the more you'd recognize that I think they do have your best interest at heart and that's not what you just said during the break there you go yeah yeah yeah okay what he just said about these people they're not right oh crap like you'd like I was telling you if they would have put us on a year on in KFI even though there's the three-hour time difference what would be wrong with that I'll add a show up a switch I could do a show from like noon to four which would be nine to one out there right out of two yeah before here yeah what would be wrong with that if you did your show what noon before here that's nine to one out there so wouldn't school with their morning drive show which probably is five then I and by the way that's show I if you heard that show handle yeah oh my god yeah grow tassel yeah the second market and he had to keep but then again keep in mind they had Tom like his son here they had Tom and Tom like his who left this market in the middle of the night yeah I know it was like the Indianapolis cult which is Neil who bought uh uh uh licensed tag on a back by the way speaking of Tom like way to penis Arizona who he was doing pretty well in LA and I haven't to know what he's making and you're making more than he is right now he was doing well in LA you know they did research on Tom like his they found out that people because he did one of these issues shows and he had her of Ruben from the JDL on and he had all of the Tom master from the area nations and he did a lot of these explosive issue type shows um they finally found out that people tuned into his show to hear the issues they didn't necessarily learn him yeah and and he never did really break through in LA in four and a half years in terms of in terms of just based numbers but what you got to break through and he's a piece of crap he is Tom like his is not a talent he uh he got a lot of ink and he got a lot of notoriety he's a self promoter oh yeah me best I've ever seen yeah and if you had that skill yeah if you had like a skill itself from or if I had a good agent it's right who wasn't in jail at the moment okay so I got a great agent he just happens to be in prison okay what tell my gun to do that at the moment for the next ten to the air you got what you who's your guy uh boss the water to two hours no that's in my uh deal that's in the original one the 10 or 30 is how did that date happen no I'm just I'm just saying it's after a year of the change whatever the date would be I just gave you the date any radio state any new company guys right can I just kiss Jennifer goodbye are you gonna start picking on poor jet for again she loves you she didn't get to rip me and I just wanted to let her know that I would she thinks you're wasting your time yeah okay we're gonna take some calls all the way ahead every line of the up right when we work at a ticket he calls now that we are gonna take calls they all flew away what's like I said it's an unfriendly crowd bokeh hey guys yes sir you think at the bay yeah rick and such show now you can't deal with it very boring and unfawning yeah and those little promos that they run yeah the worst anybody who doesn't listen to the show who listens to one of those promos yeah it's not gonna listen to the show okay so you're out so maybe the show is a band maybe just maybe just about wait a minute maybe the show is okay but the promos suck do you ever think about that you do you know that very briefly yeah but I don't know if those were Steve Nichols idea or what but those promos are awful they're not funny and what about the other day parts they're in the summer still hungry yeah that's show I've ever heard there you go it's that's number two vote best show in the end Miami and he's even though it's gonna happen yeah yeah that's what makes it the best okay you're shown you all it's just kind of rolls along yeah I'm just that's what I said a few months ago I'm just like an old comfortable shoe and I've just rolls along and I'm just here not that great when you're going out to do some yard work you just throw on that old comfortable right that's it a little dirt right you know I I I I'm modal I see it's good it's good that you're leaving feel it's good because now I can be you know number one kid on the block again but keep probably to the threshold look at your ad on like Jennifer said jumping your car go home work on your phone yeah you'll get better all right okay right now thanks for the advice okay it's in front of me one more way we yeah Miami on the purple line hello I forget it uh Rick don't even bother going home trying to work on it I got it the nail on the head you are without a doubt the most that is the worst thing I've ever heard in my life on the right yeah without a doubt yeah all right no let me ask you this you know wait a minute sir sir if we brought back Chuck Meyer do you think that it might like soften up the edges a little bit nothing can help it it's too worst if I talked on this phone for 36 hours I couldn't scratch the surface of beginning to tell you just how terrible you are well how about 52 minutes you have you have not a single funny bone in your body I've never heard one thing that I could listen to for a minute what my pants get another career to get out of it you're terrible nobody likes you guys have no talent you're doing that's torque is crazy loser's beat it but what is he really think so that I hate people to beat around here smiling you're taking any of you well you know smiling but see this one thing about the iod audience and even though they're listening to my show I'm just I'm not really that good I'm just uh you know I'm just here and there's nothing a lot of yard work they're doing a lot of yard work and they're killing some time and I'm a perfect for that that's good like you said for a lot of other greener patches out there here's how lady hello yes ma'am I think you great you make my day now who are you talking to me all right oh thank god that some old lady likes me thank god thanks mom oh stop what about the rick and spud what do you do me a favor what's that would you play the tape yeah okay see that's my crot that's all I got left well when you've been here for 50 years and your median demographic is death what do you expect plantation hello all right I'm one guy the life-rickens uh yeah all right yeah but I have to admit when they had Marvin and Chuck Marron all that the show was better yeah Marvin sure is how was it a lot more entertaining than Adam was Marvin on your show oh the best thing about Marvin used to do is that what we're sure we almost over yeah and tell Jennifer to shut up she's no Dorothy Maggantire herself she's stuck yeah where's I mean rick's alright he just it's not it's crowded in the morning put her afternoons and see what see what they see what happens give it us a shot okay and fill Henry the best I hope he could be some of us down here someday okay and now you're the best now and I'm the best fills the best and I'm the best and rick is okay it's good please wait he all right fair okay thanks a lot okay so we finally got what I said you're okay that's good but uh open line of Broward 5249463524WI in other words my show is okay for why you're gardening and what you're doing uh rickens such what are you doing a good here's a mobile in Miami hello oh yeah yes sir I don't think it's fair that you know people are people that are calling in are judging rickens such a lot of your advice is listen to the only you I mean there are different lives well I don't have too many good things to say about me that's one good thing about the irony audience they don't like it in the view huh they can listen to you I mean I think they got to just call them just keep nothing but hate probably does not listen to rickens I mean I listen to all three of you and uh with an every American said because that's what I'm in the car most and I you know there's different things to enjoy about each different show yeah each each I'm sure there's people who listen to rickens out that wouldn't turn the radio when you're on for nothing you're in sea thank god you know if that's uh that's just a different like different women and different food you have to enjoy different things about them right I mean the rickens such a great uh your god and uh for the antichrist and you know I just uh I don't you have a different reason I don't think we have a lot of crossover and uh between no and the show I think each show has its own audience I think you're probably the only guy I'll leave it to what do you have to talk to for you if I can't listen to all the other one yeah thanks a lot pal okay there's the one I think you're right I think there is no crossover because I know when I come on a 10 o'clock when a phone is dead as a door nail in fact what he's to follow Reneri which we had very little crossover it was you know the first 10 15 minutes as I was sitting here bs and uh the lines would be lit and then by the time I finished with the first break we were a rocket and rolling hmm now it's like wow death deadly you mean there was crossover between you and Reneri yeah amazingly enough even though we did entirely different show we had older demographics but there was there was something there was some continuity now it's like there's a just a total for all of this criticism that you got your taking no he's not criticism it's just a fact I'm not making that oh I'm not seeing you I mean I mean people on the phone we ever had a situation like we have the last few months where every I mean I sit here for like 10 minutes and I'm rambling on and you you're expecting to see you know here they come nothing right well I know that I know but yeah you know that for four hours but you know but you don't need the calls you got all these your own calls but you're probably you're lucky about that you're probably going to hell yeah here longer than any I'm going to hell you're probably gonna be here longer than me if it's not even a tired one or five years nearly on here you'll be the deal you're probably going to bring up my amy radio yeah for all of this this oh I hope not strongly how I get it attitude about you guys and and that's because you guys have been around a long time people have strong feelings about your positive negative whatever you know that's interesting that you would say that they kind of sound like something around Benickson uh... uh... right right since three i've had no sleep it's okay i got one i open i can deal with this don't start making excuses again next you'd be blaming Dorothy mac and tear for it yeah you know well uh... Jennifer said to go home and do some show prep or do some gardening one thirteen a w i o d do add on to your existing home planning a new cool or just thinking of enclosing a patio well then what a shahara copender uh... feel hindered two to six p.m. on news talking entertainment radio sixteen w i o d okay one sixty what do you mean how long before the audience figures they're back on that there's this is bad at the back on there's going to be a billboards and uh... adds and tv spots and uh... now will sandwich boards green savers will they will they return to the am dial for running i don't know that's the thing that's the question how many people in any given market can change can move an audience as they say that's what the program is called moving the audience can you move from a m to fm can you move from station one station two can you move from one day part to another that's the true test yeah and and uh... how many of them seriously can figure out how did i am you know i mean you get a lot of people calling and say you know when we went out we did that don't get a lot of them you know what is that am what number so ten and you'll right and when you don't say ninety seven points something because you're dealing with the call who are not familiar with the am world it's not part of their lives they can grow up with it and they had never had any reason in this market to turn on add them told me it's actually called in car windows telling people and punched the band button for them to show them where they're in the morning right and that's it well that's encouraged that's a nice call to be good so it's well buddy but it's a for future radios on a m my amy hello my amy yes sir can't hear you okay all right well basically i had to call because i couldn't take it anymore as far as i'm concerned all today if you have an excellent show rick and said are actually in the morning they've always been there still if i can happen well this is it and when the winter morning you have a great show in sort of still i mean all you bought a colleague and they're there's a bunch of work yeah and at four of the you don't fit in sir you have nothing negative to say you don't fit in no it's a forner you'll catch on just keep listening okay it's far ahead good Jennifer what Jennifer also you it's not which press you there it says in all rick for staying in your show and the press you just goes back from her news and creates a great as a gift you did the 50 she was crazy there's a great point on to a whole thing right make it known that i never told Jennifer what to do however she's told me all morning what i should be doing on my show that's right i mean nothing was a here the one was a thing that pathetic show about the Jimmy racing about the sympathetic all for Jimmy did not was she did after they uh well here we were thinking you were a nice guy sir uh she did a five hour after they found the whole right five hour marathon news thing yeah five hour newscast okay thank you so much here's a poppin oh hello hey break your an apple now you should feel honored that's it's the same guy that's all kind of online yeah so that's that's his uh that's his well you're happy and funny a lot of these people think they're actually being funny that's their culture issue that's I'm not pretty good it was a little bit more of our call so far yeah this might be a lot of enthusiasm my name hello when is deas how you doing okay i just want to say at the rick and such a yeah yeah we get off the phone is it where is this when the racial issue has anything a compete with full Henry yeah and uh you want to talk about the end of you oh baby oh that that jackass again the new world order and wo i thought it was this wrestling league the

time listener i think neals you all your own rick i do have my own a lot you have whatever anyway i think that there is nobody like Phil Henry from the moment i heard him with the candle up in the peach i said who is this guy and i knew he was a genius and there is nobody better and i'm ready to move to LA i have every friend waiting to hear him i just think if i own the station i'd have paid any amount of money to keep him because i think he's a genius well now you know why cock's going let him go i believe i just don't get it but that's besides the point and as far as rick and said i used to listen because they were the only thing in town and i'm sorry to say that it's like my afternoon is spent all the time in the corner i mean i'm gonna suffer with wf the other something because i'm just not a rick and sudsman and i feel sorry that i guess maybe my business will pick up all starts you know going in that is a shame well see there's a blessing in disguise for you every dark

is occurring because the the station hasn't promoted you guys the way it should have and uh i think there's actually a pretty big crossover but it's just not the kind of people who get you know ratings books unfortunately to fill them out and because we're in the minority here and and so w-w-doesn't that uh pair to be doing as well as it really is you know when the little slip to paper come across the desk it doesn't say what's really happening it certainly doesn't reflect um that's good i like that certainly i thought what does that mean a ratings in midday are pretty good ratings in afternoon or back up there they're pretty strong no i i've been thinking about it so i i think they are but i i think that your ratings are probably not as high as they really are what are you saying is like a part of this now we're in the who's ratings are not as high we talk about it all three of you i think it's filled nails and reconciled ratings i think that all of your ratings are not as high as they would be because of the demographic that's represented if you looked at the demographic that's represented above who could and would be listening to you i don't think that it's on the earth and dial no let's man's got a plan you find out who's listening it's people who would never fill out a diary on a back because they're making all kinds of money and i would love to do it exactly i will listen to you all day and and because i would listen to you and i like you all i would fill out the book if it came but i'm not going to do it for a dollar or five dollars or whatever ridiculous amount of money that is that they pay to do this it's a it's a it's a poor polling message but if you can become an ethnic minority if you change your name to Gonzalez or get some charcoal yeah they pay like probably 150 bucks a day you know but it doesn't have roof i don't think it really don't get those large families they got 15 kids in the they're all on welfare and i get the 15 diaries man five bucks a pop you're talking some serious brand there's nobody in this room there's nobody in this room that you're talking and i think they'll have one either i think that for the people who really are your potential audience plenty of it if you guys are all probably between like uh you know five and twelve shares depending on the day i got a uh television nielson diary once yeah and i was really excited about it i said look at this i am a kneel so family i'll add another one for you and i have been doing very very well put sure who wants to make an entire log of their entire week for a buck so you know what you know what i'm afraid of filith if you got another log from the nielson diaries my favorite martian would probably be the number one rated showing my amy why yeah i would still know you know just for a kick and giggles i think i'm going that could could really swing things you could and if more people knew that that's right it really brings things up here we could really screw the exactly so when you next time you get a diary so i i guess i'm just saying i don't think any of you have been done justice and did your artist next time you get a diary we'll give you the extra ten bucks out well i think i think i have been done justice i i've been offered a good position in it with a with a company in Los Angeles home town yeah i i started and talk radio six years ago i started in ventura california for you yeah no are they are they're picking right boy have a great life and here's uh my amy under purple line hello very hey niel yes there's a very

Hollywood hello hi Neil how you doing pretty good hey listen i i enjoy the conversation and i was actually introduced to i od i'm a white male mid twenty thank god are you so good size um yes i am oh thank the lord stop it right there please get better by the minute okay i was introduced to i od probably five years ago because of the buttload bank at you two to six hour which was yeah my right now um which was written such he's on right now yeah we got we got a few bands that want to hear you but anyway definitely i then drifted back into the two out two to six sorry ten to two and was i was introduced to you yeah um the change over that broad feel handsery on i think that was not something that was conducive for Rick and Sud they're not a morning show and that's not anything against you Rick it just happens to be that it's uh it's a long time i've said that over and over right i mean it's just not there's not a lot not a lot of continuity and unfortunately that's just you know it's not a conducive show to that i went you excited about going to mornings though and if in the initial stages as it was presented yeah but he wouldn't have to do a show for it and kind of all the matter of fact it was there was a a real long back and forth in fact that whole wood boy Gary and the lawsuit and all another crap it was uh yeah it was no and then and then Gary Bruce left yeah that was right the one the decision was made right he left and left us here and we just kind of fended for ourselves there was no program director that was no promotion there was we initiated a morning show with nobody helping out and no bad no nothing yeah mochuk was there yeah don't worry about the Chuck Meyer thing i i think he was not really too good as a character and i didn't think he added anything to Rick's show all right i'm sure we like that before he leaves somebody called and uh you know verified what i said before chucks uh you know great news guys a good guy but for some reason you got a fetish i mean i think Rick is in the fat guys just something but uh i remember i think he filled in for you at one time you were out for a week kneel right it was terrible actually also talk with him and he wouldn't let me get in a word edge wine yeah and uh it was just uh kind of difficult to imagine him having his own show but those hot news maker interviews man that's where it's at have it right day pal okay yeah let's bring back the monkey in the morning well he's i don't know they just say stuff back at your renier yeah who's listening right now bow boy but you're foaming at

Yes sir Okay You're that Ricky, hate to like poison But drive careful, okay pal Have a great day Yeah, it's just a thing Work doesn't seem to understand Of course he's melodalots And those well not a lot, little bit Not at all Yeah, no he has melodal bit Years ago they really hated him like poison In fact, I think I might have not never hated him But I think I just He was kind of a hard ass Remember those days when he was like Really obnoxious Now he's kind of, I don't know, he's lost the edge I think maybe if he goes back to being even more of a hard ass And starts ripping into animal time And just, you know, they don't understand I think that might do the job form Create into kind of a new image You're bring back the old one What the hate him enough Here's Miami Beach, hello Um, Neil? Yes sir Yeah, I just want to say Rick and says are pretty good I mean, you know, they have their days Yeah, up and down You know, everybody does It's like a 95 year old, you know, somebody in a nursing home Yeah, they have their days Not too often, but once in a while, they have a good day I started listening to you guys because we're going to bank a Maccurrier Yeah And they only have AAM on their radio in the cars Yeah So unfortunately, I got stuck with that, but then I started listening to you guys And see, another one of these accidents Where you got to do you just locked into it Or we locked into you Yeah, but it's pretty good I'm impressed with you and Phil too And Rick and says are okay, you know, but now's good to be guys Okay, but we'll go along with that Okay, you guys have a good one Thanks pal Okay, so we says that Phil and I are great in Rick and so it's They're okay I mean, you know, they're in a quiet taste and once I don't know what Rick is so defensive in psychotic about Once they get back on there and they have to know everything's going to be fine And I will though, I'm going to live up to my ward As I try to do the thing about the ratings And some of the ratings may have been And keep you see years ago, people used to care about that Now they just, it's just not the same feeling The same ambiance When the trends come out when the book comes out It's not the same But I think that it's going to be interesting We'll take the last number that Phil Henry has in the final trend And when that comes out that'll be kind of like the standard You know, whatever number they have to beat And of course, if Rick doesn't beat it, well Here's Davey, hello Hey, here's my critique by IOT15 Yes Rick and says kind of boring a lot of dead air And kind of awkward Seems like there's a lot of trends where It's just trying to think of something to say You're doing this 20 I think that's an accurate assessment Yeah You're so you have the uncanny ability to do nothing And be extremely entertaining Right I don't know how to do that And that's no, I take that as a compliment I come in here every day for four hours And I make something out of nothing And I have no attention to changing that I don't want to come in here with some kind of a prefab Prearranged I don't want to do that anymore I want to come in here And spontaneously generate crap I'm telling you, they take it as a compliment Because that's how it's meant Okay And we still look to the word genius It's been bandied about like Right And I agree more Yep I mean it's electrifying But it's frustrating And I'm sure it must have been for him too Because you take a look at the stuff that he's done And the amount of reaction and response to it And then you look at the ratings And you know, like I was saying The lack of commercial success What? And it's just, I don't understand it The audience is a blessing in the curse It's a blessing because it provides fodder for him To do his thing with it Right The blocking and play with the audience Right But it's also a curse because people are just I want to see doing I don't understand So I think a lot he lost a lot of folks with his edge Because it was a very sophisticated comic Yeah And this of course being such as sophisticated market Yeah You're cute out to George He was an incredible boarder You see the real tight board Incredible work Editing and producing the best of tapes And one final question Who does the local tags on the national spot? There's their really bad Okay I'll tell Kenny you said so Okay Thank you Okay, even again a shot for Kenny in there Here's plantation, hello No Yes sir Today was your best show, however My agree This is probably the best show in the history of radio I would say You guys should do that every day until the sale takes over I agree I think that everybody also had a comment on this show I'll come in a few minutes early And we ought to hang around When in doubt we'll hang it out Yeah, at least for an hour or so Okay It's a deal Okay So there's the deal Rick's going to hang around till two every day Phil's going to come in around noon 12 30 We're going to sit around and do this every day And when in doubt Blow it out Shoot it out Right So I knew it I felt it was coming And guess what There it was They loved it They just people in the building are sitting around People don't even know that this radio station is on here They're running out there Changing to put an IOD on a marquee for one Recording your broadcast and you think Drop the expert Larry King You're listening to the worst talk radio in America W-I-O-D Miami Fort Lauderdale News talking in her take From 3K-0 610 W-I-O-D
