My, from the old age, I'll introduce you to the 610 WIOD presents the Neil Rager Show, the doctor, Neil calls 622 WIOD a day, 767 WIOD in Rower, toll free 888-949 WIOD, and 18C Wireless and World of 1 Customers called toll free at the Hound IOD. Now, the Neil Rager Show. Hi, this is Sunny Fox, I listen to Neil Rager's, because I could hear the word asshole. Boy, when this quote of Beck gets lonely, she likes receiveers that are white. Some people say that number ages gain, they say troil of the big brown eye, aeg man, break them. He goes down on his knees and aeg man. It's guys he likes to please aeg man. He loves to slap cowboys on their behind. He's got a spotless reputation. America's team is world renowned. But his trod he, I've heard some people say, in the heart of he goes down, aeg man. He goes down on his knees and aeg man. I can some balls to squeeze aeg man. Don't slip him cause he likes it from behind. Right, don't. Unbelievable. Amen. Here we are. Can't believe it. Too good to be true. It's like we've been here all our lives in it. All right. We're in our brand new state of the art studios. We're out of that dump. We're like out of 79. Speed, we're out of date County. And all we can say is, yes. Oh my god. What a relief. We've got a gigantic studio audience. So we did for Alex Bennett. And Mike, we're not my workout okay for me. Now, let me ask you something. Is this because, does this sound okay in there? It sounds sensational. They said better than ever. In fact, it sounds too good to be you. So did we get screwed last night or what? Now, probably we're going to get a tremendous tumult. Now, what? Let me ask you something. What is that? How do they know what the numbers are? How do they know what the numbers are? Did they give the number and we can't? It's on the open. Oh, it's on the open. She's just a host of that. It's on the open. I thought maybe these people were smart. Who's going to be our first caller in our new studio's man? Who's going to be our first caller? I bet to the packs and people know what big shooters they are. Probably give like a million dollars. Not to the first caller. And like two million of the first caller in Broward. Not. Huh? And 10 million of the first caller in Palm Beach. Not. Okay, this is an exciting moment, ain't it? W-I-O-D. Bill. Yes. I hope you're right about that. Cash. I need cash. How are you? We'll send you over a little sack. All right. This is Bill. Last year I don't want to. Bill, you're our free. Don't sell very excited, but you're our first caller in our new studio. I am excited for you. If you could be in here and see, this is like a palace. You could eat off the floor. But the engineering staff says don't even think about trying it. It is amazing. You've never dropped any food in your life. Yeah. I've dropped a few times. This is Bill. I dropped off some panther tickets for you last year to give away. Because I ate it from to go to waste when I couldn't make a couple of those games. Yeah. I'm a panther fan and boil. We're going to get a great job on commentary last night. For him, yeah, was pretty good. We got screwed though. I see my asses all I can say. Leave it to that PR-RASIC. Leave it to a frog. This ticket to us. A frog in a backstabbing Russian. Covalev who picked up his skate and let the puck go by. There was, I was screaming when the lines have been put his hand up in the air to call the icing. I said, there's no icing there. You just knew they were taking it away from us. We was robbed, man. But you know something? We'll still take the tie. Bill? Bill? Bill? Uh-huh. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha. I think we just lost Bill. That was a beautiful thing. Did you patch you around and air with Bill or just uh... I didn't do it. He just expired. Nice going, Bill. I'll have a great life and whatever you had, I hope it was good. Good for you. W-I-O-D. Yes, sir. You got some great. Yeah, we do. How were the fans behavior in 106 plus 9? I was only going to spend probably like an hour and a half to hours on that. Oh no. The first period I gave him an A-plus. I told all the guys there. You've been spectacular. I'm going to redeem you guys on the ear to Marl. You were great. The second period I would give him like a B. Okay. Second period was okay. They started to get... There were tension span is a little on the short side. They can use like some toys. Do you know what I'm saying? Yeah. And the third period I would give him like a C-minus. I'll be generous. Because I mean, here's a game. We're head one nothing, right? Almost the whole game. Like from the end of the first period, almost to the end of the game. And in the third period after some of the guys, like two or three of them got on their 14th beer, it started to get in just a little on a sloppy side. You know what I'm saying? A lot of women in the shape. A little on a sloppy side. And then by give high marks to our friend Adam, though, who sits right next to me. Because he kept yanking these guys by the back of their shirt. Sit down. Sit down. You know, he knew that they were under great scrutiny. And he was okay. Nice job, Adam. Didn't lean forward, didn't they? No, they did not. A couple of my think might be leaning backward. But that's after the 20 or 30th beer. It was okay. A good time was had by all the ceremonies were great. Did you see it? Yes, I did. What's in it? Yeah, and they headed on, right? Yes. All right. Hey, we're waiting here about Bobby Green and the Cock people. Trust me, it only starts today. I got stories that last from now until what year is it? What century is it? That he's there. Okay, you'll hear it, pal. All right, now. Have a great day. Okay, beautiful. I got to get used to all this stuff because, uh, look at that. Now let me ask you one question now. Let me ask you a question. Why is it like lying, what is 13? What is that? Do you want to know the line? We're working on the labeling and all that. That's the mobile line? That's the pound line. Are you sure? Yeah, trust me. How much does it take? Here's the purple line. Hello. Meals. Yes. It's those referee socks. Yeah, they do. Backstabbing frog Pierre Razzico. I mean, he even said it on the air last night that he's added in for the, uh, the The. Mark Faw set the referee is added in for us for a long time. And he's stuck to join out. But the point is when they blow a call like that. And I screwed it with apoplectic. But when he blow a call like that, usually when it's that obvious, the referee will overrule them and then they'll have the face off its center. Rice. And they'll say we made a mistake and the, the face off goes to center. Rice. Instead, it goes into our end. The only, you know, I never would second guess my good buddy Doug McLean except except on make one exception this moment. And that is if it would have been me at that point, I would have called my time out. They had the one time out left. I would have come to everybody down because the guys were apoplectic. They were very unprepared for that face off. We never got control of it. And they just kept whack it away there in front of it and they stuck it in. You're absolutely right. Yeah. Absolutely right. If you want to just if Doug would have just looked across that, I'd have given the high sign we'd have been all right. Right. But then again, McLean was all apoplectic too about the whole thing. I mean, he was trying to get him to change the call. Yeah. He can he protest again from that point on. He's not not going to protest again on an icing call. You can't do that. Is that a judgment call? Yeah. Okay. Because that's a shame. But I want to tell you one thing. No. Let me just say this. Then he Lee last. I mean, bezer played phenomenal. He was great. And we get to expect that every night. A Glenn Healey played the game of his life for them last night. If he Lee wouldn't have played that game last night, you wouldn't have had a worry about it. And he icing call because we'd had six, seven goals. We'd have blown him out. If Richter would have started last night, we'd have blown their ass out. No question about he Lee was saw he was in another world. Yeah. He really was. Break away after break away after. And then I hear these guys say on radio, wow, you know, I guess the Ranger defense played pretty well. What defense? How can you have like six, seven, eight breakaways in a game and say the defense was playing pretty good? Exactly. You will sound the radio? No, I'm away home. Okay. This is in the post game analization when they were analyzing it. I wouldn't listen to them. But the TV was great. The ceremonies was fantastic. Yeah. They did a really super job. Really felt the sense of pride with that whole thing. Yeah. It was great. And let me also say this. Did you notice? Yeah. I mean, I mean, during the opening ceremonies, there were like six rats thrown on the ice. I don't want to say the guy with a green shirt who sits in our section three seats to my right. Who drinks 80 beers a game. I don't want to say he was the one that threw three of those big rats on the ice. But I will anyway. So I goes to show you like only two or three bows. Those out there even during a ceremonies were so compelled with us to do that. I don't want to say he was the one that threw three of those big rats on the ice. But I will anyway. So I goes to show you like only two or three bows. They're even during a ceremonies were so compelled with us that they had to do their rat number. They'll grow up and hopefully they'll put up like the rest of the panther fans or great fans. And they definitely deserve everything they get. I'll tell you last night was, I think it up to Broward. It was just like a playoff game last night. The atmosphere in there was electric. It was even better the quality of play. The players were up to it too. Yeah. I don't think there's any left out from the end of last year. I was afraid that there might be. But playing has them in shape and they look like they're ready to go. Amen. Look at four to a great year. Maybe undefeated wouldn't that be nice. 81.01. There you go. Sounds realistic to me. Good luck at the new place. Thanks a lot, Bell. You're first on the prone. You used to be the purple line. Yeah, how do they color code it or not? Now it's going to be the green line for all of Patients money. Have a great day, Bell. See the cox sisters got a lot of money. You know, the $1.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0101.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.0100.01.02.01.01.01.09.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.09.ory.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.02.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01. stoichi merchant!01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01.01 Okay, let me give those new numbers up because if you didn't hear me at the beta for the RNA open well everybody should be listening at the open especially today I know where they're listening right now I don't want to mention it's 1401 North Bay causeway They're not listening the hot not so hot 105 They're not coasting out here in T.A. that especially with Johnny Dolan still a building They're not listening to that slush They're listening to us right now and they probably got to tapes rolling I mean there's nothing going on in that studio are those those machines still in there those tape decks Yeah, man.

It works. Is that incredible or what? And we still pay for it Pal All right, there we go. That was the that was the green lines. You just knew that here's a curl springs See in another thing two these numbers these are numbered like one two three We're working on that. Okay, and that listen. I don't want to start getting pushy on the first day I realized they've spent four million dollars just in this room alone, but let's get with it. Here's a Cooper City. Hello Yes, sir. This isn't Cooper City. Where are you? Coral springs. Well, that's close enough. Who gives a crap? Yeah. Hey, you don't want to think something's going on with the phone How do I sound from that end? How do you sound? Yeah, I mean talking to you. Not too exciting. Well I don't mean that. I think something's wrong with the phone, so was that you sound okay? Because can you hear me? Yeah, but you sound good now. Huh? Yeah, you sound a little static. Staticy yeah, yeah, you sound a queer clear as a bell. Okay, so find a me so far All right, well, listen hey, man. It's a great day to be a a panther fan. It's a great day to be alive It's a great day to be in in this radio station. It's a great day to be a panther fan. We're undefeated What's re-in? Yeah, when they raised that banner last night right. Did you get goosebumps in places? I've never known I got chills in my vacuum just to watching the ceremony Hey listen for years you've been cracking me up. Yeah, and Congratulations on the new move. I hope let me ask you seriously. How does this on a ear and not on your phone? How does it sound from here? I don't know because I bet on hold since you started the show I like I said let me ask somebody who knows okay. Yeah, I'm curious about that because it you just It feels like you're like in a real radio studio as opposed to in a broom closet Well, you sound like you got a lot of piss and vinegar today mostly the first part. Yeah, well, that's all right And the bad part of it is even though the restroom is on the same floor. It's about a mile and a half away We need the exercise. Hey, one concern though about the panther. What is that? What's the problem with the power play? We're only over 15. What are you complaining about? A little around to over. Yeah, you're right. What's the problem? Gotta get working on that power play all the last night. You know we had a lot of great chances Healy was unconscious and I thought we passed it around pretty good. It's just that we couldn't stick at biome No, I know it. I hope it doesn't come by to come back to bite us Yeah, when you know even last year we had the great year but our power play for the most part still stuck to joy Now we still got to find a combination that make that power play work. We got to do something on it Well, we got a lot of games left and we're doing a good job killing off the penalties too By the way, we're doing a great job on that That worked well last night Bezeray Sharpe is can be he was phenomenal again last night and I think he's just sitting to a groove And that's one area the game. We don't have to worry about it all. He's phenomenal How would you rate Bezer in the league in the top three? No quite right now? No question about it Even right now the way he's playing right now. He is as good as anybody I mean healy the game you played last night. You can't play a better game than that But you know one game doesn't make a career healy is okay like then you know Healy is the little disgruntled because he knows that with Richter in here Richter's always gonna be the starter and healy's gonna Spot started so he's disgruntled about that, but at the same time he knows that he's on a team with a lot of you know a lot of talent They spent a lot of money on there and he's really best these last couple years when he comes in and they spot him here in there and he can play a game like that Yeah, well anyway In closing I want to say gratzky sucks. Yeah, he didn't do much No, he made a couple of nice passes. He was dangerous a couple of times But generally speaking he wasn't much of a factor like I said before without Messier that team is a shadow You're right and even with them. I don't think they're going anywhere Well, we saw what the would say Lewis paid him and how far that took up right exactly So they had a struggle to get by the falling leafs But anyway listen got blessed the panthers good luck in the new studio and and have a great day and thank you so much Have a great life pal.

That's you know Maybe we're in deserves to win but no, I think we played out standing I mean the first two periods especially this is the thing that's heartbreaking and you see it in sports all the time Well one team out plays the other one by such a big margin early in the game and you can't put anything on a board It's like the dolphins how many times you know on Sunday I thought to myself here we go again We drive it right down a field spikes is running like crazy Our running game is working and Eric said look fine in that first drive and we get first in goal on the three-yard line field goal again How many times have we seen that? Yeah, if you if you're doing your thing early in the game and you can't put points or goals or whatever on a board You're gonna wind up either blowing it and you're losing it I was on a live in Kansas City in the sports bar actually and they've seen those in Kansas City believe it or not Yeah, I'm a ship watching that game Thank God you don't have that here, man We don't want these pace makers given on places packed yeah, I'm a little nowhere What a shock people actually looking for a good time yeah, and I was in driving my in my car last night 648 PM waiting for the pre-game shooter come on yeah, and Hank is still on and oh and my glad you mentioned that's bad Slob man I see your car already yeah, he's all excited say all the excitement at your need of electricity and oh my god Here comes the rats and then a few seconds later he says oh no those are the bucks coming up to the edge Yeah, he wouldn't know a rat he wouldn't know a rat's ass from a puck I had several spyre ports on his performance yesterday first of all I have no idea why they send him over there because he doesn't know the game He hates being there he keeps you know he alternates between sand. Oh, yeah, these guys are all great from Tori and Wayne all the way on down all the players Which is true, but we already know that he alternates between that faked enthusiasm and saying well No wonder we got no calls, you know come over here to our hockey game. You know try to do a show He doesn't like it he hates it. He doesn't understand it knows nothing about it But they find somebody knows a little something about and get his fat ass out of there And that's where you know in addition to which you know we had all these people get their early last night and he had been there since early and he Afternoon they were already running short of food as a concession stands Just because fats are was in there Well, the papers this morning the players so the usual class and said hey, we'll take the point Right, that's right. They're not crying. They're not belly aching. It was disappointing I mean you go down to inside the last minute of the game protecting that lead, but We'll take the point we'll take two oh and one and those first three games against teams like that That's right Amen. All right, have a good stay. Okay pal have a great life Okay, that's our fly in friend there. We got a lot of those 10 42 a Wiod on a really spectacular boy.

His hair's receding her hair's protruding a film that proves opposite to a tract Look all I'm saying is that a man and a woman can't be friends without having sex But in your case, I'll make an exception when Sally got Harry now playing at a theater near you rated P8 10 46 a Wiod so anyway, let's show we start with just like maybe one once an hour will come up with another story another bubble my son other episode another lie From the powers that were at Wiod before the sail took place for example. Remember last Christmas the day before Christmas and all through the place We were spraying the man has been with the big cans of mace But anyway, so a bob green takes me to lunch on December whatever the Friday was before Christmas Sunday and He's gonna like lay out for me to lay it. You know, this is my good close personal friend who's so concerned about my welfare Who would never stick me in a bag who would never let me down etc Takes me across the street. What was the name of that? It's honey restaurant Right across by the pill doctor George Oh my god You've gotta be kidding me Anna pretty. Oh very good. Okay. That's close enough and it takes me over to Anna. Come pre for a cheap meal And so we're sitting there and he lays all this crap out for me and The station is not being sold. It's not for sale and yada yada yada and listen at all this other stuff None of it other than the only thing he told me that did come true in ad meeting was we were getting rid of the traffic Metro traffic and getting our own Traffic people Yeah, they turned out to be great. Do they the levels on these things by the way in his 360? Whoever dubbed these things originally? We need to put them in a rigan. You know what I'm saying? As in oh? Really low. Are you all away up? It's as it's I'm as up as far as mine will get up. Okay. That's as high as it gets trust me So anyway the station's not for sale. Then we have the meeting with Bob Neal back on May 21st where he gets all of people from all three A cock stations in across the street very close by the way. Anna can pre right next door to it And we're sitting and there when he gets up and makes this torpedo little speech about well You know, we've tried everything for the last 10 years and since the mid 80s and we can't make any money with this turkey and Basically you guys suck and now we're gonna let somebody else try to make some money with and Come to find out he says well the negotiations with the Paxon people have been going on now for on and off for at least the last year And based on reports we got from certain people inside who will go on name because we liked some of them It was going on for at least a year maybe you're in a half but the station wasn't for sale They would never lie to us and they would never screw us. Okay, and by the way Let's say a prayer Neal. Okay. Let's say a prayer here's an article about Paxon by the way Neal We just hold a station you're going to work from we assign your contract here's an article about Paxon. Oh my god. You're in big trouble now Yeah, we're in big trouble now Mr. Hotshot Like those vents baby. Remember that story with events that we were all choking and gagging Well, it's not economically feasible for us at this time to worry about that we can't we can't do it So I had to get on here and have people call OSHA people were threatening to call OSHA the occupational safety hazard administration And come in here and practically close that joint down before we trade it out needless to say they couldn't come up with the cash out of the rate billion dollars Trade it out for very code and the AC people to come in here and clean that joint out which they took 50,000 tons of crap out of the vents out of that building Probably which hadn't been cleansed before and we burrow as a baby I should really you know Bob Green always told me Neal you should write a book you should really write a book. I should write a book And most of it would be about him. I mean when Disney was there released in the beginning we had our traveils We had our problems. We went through some crap, but nothing like the last three or four years. It was just beyond belief Just go in there and make it happen. Okay, just go in there. Don't expect any promotion to expect any spot Don't expect any equipment though expect any maintenance So it was we're supposed to sit in there and just make something happen by ourselves Which I guess most of us have a lot of experience Here's Virginia key hello Welcome and congratulations Uncle Neal. Thank you so much Sir. I am free at last pal You know it when you're on hold that that last car was right your microphone sounds very static He Georgia sound fine, but you're sound something like something's not right with it.

It sounds so much it sounds like like I hate I say FM Really yeah sounds really really clear on dispersion the phone. I can't wait I don't think there's too many FM's got equipment like this. I'll guarantee you that well, you know Congratulations and not you're definitely deserving of it as a talent of your caliber But I have to say yes I am Hockey game was brilliant last night. It was great to see it for free. Yeah, what a concept My boss came in yesterday and and said hey it's baseball tonight and my buddy I work with and I look at each other. We're like no hockey and he says quote oh you don't like baseball because you're an asshole Oh really yeah, what tell what the oldest in me? I don't know like like baseball It has even an eye-oat of excitement in it. Not only that, but do you think there's any contest? I mean I realized the baseball season's over for the marlins, but even with Jim Leedland being son as the new manager you think there's any contest between the the interest level in this town right now Even with the playoffs going on between the Panthers and baseball Nobody here gives a flying crap about baseball Right exactly and the answer is suck. I think is the word you're looking for And he could run the bases the sky could not run the bases it's life dependent on it. Yeah, that's the other funny thing about these baseball guys There's a lot of them that I see there just you know They just to take they couldn't even go run the freaking bases. Yeah, so anyway just wanted to say congratulations and And keep up the good work your new station you sound a lot happier. It's probably better for your health Oh, you haven't got any idea not only that you know this morning. I did a little experiment Come into work because I didn't have it.

Hey, you know I don't know what to tell you about that because it sounds okay and here in my monitor and it sounds great on here Is what everybody's telling me like uh better than even usual Oh, well, so maybe just to keep you on your toes while you're on hold And that's true. You know it's a new studio You know what else it might be right to discourage some of the pain in the ass people who call just to waste the on hold because they don't have the radio And think that they're gonna listen to the show and the type of line that could be it Well, that's true. What's your things to tell you first of all The raising the banner at the at the Game last night was unbelievable That's a great experience even though I was not there even to sit and watch that TV It brought to my eyes. Yeah, I mean it really did and I can't wait till the new stadium comes in and I will be at the game Second of all they had on on sports channel. They had the Vice-Prison General Manager of Sports Channel and they were talking about the Panthers and the thing with TCI and all that yeah Not much to say but to just to say oh whether in negotiations and it's going well and they didn't basically say anything Just remember man in the words of Bob Green. It's not a question of if it's a question of when That's true The calm by the referee by the way is everybody's been saying So yeah, I mean it was unbelievable I To me I cost us the game cost us one point in the standies. I hope that point doesn't come home at the hottest later on Tordy into the season because they definitely took a point away from us last night We should be three and right now That's right. I mean they were even talking about I was listening to QAM this morning and they were talking about it and even and I don't generally listen to QAM Yeah, but they were talking about it and how bad it was and also they were saying that they had a statement from the league office Saying that the call was a correct.

It'll be great and it's right there at the port of Miami and Mickey likes it and don't To buy any ballooning but what I don't understand is nobody seems to be talking while you did a little bit yesterday But with the corruption going on in the city of Miami. I mean now that it's got from 30 million to 68 million And I'll be alert. Docans, please guilty Oh, thank God. We got good on his government in date County. We got people like Miller Docans and Caesar Odeus and very Shriber and Johnny Jones at his gold plumbing fixtures and the list goes on and on and Joe Carroyo with his friend port Wanda with 187 grand down the toilet to try to kick the path is out of town We got the best politicians that money can't buy man. I mean, I just feel sorry my mother and last year Listen to city Miami. She pays her sorry taxes and it's just like people don't care what they do It's you know with the money. Yeah, and I get first and cut some room to put up for rent over and I'll throw you someplace Yeah, how's he doing by the way? Anybody hearing from Joe these state There's another one for you right? There's another one we kind of forgot about Or he just looked away and slipped our mind Land on the land and Australia have a great time Joe Don't spend it all in one place Unreal, but what I don't understand is how can they even come up with thinking? They're gonna be putting up a new arena when the cities in in this array the way it is yeah When it's three blocks from the prison one when Nobody wants to put up the money for it when it's based and addition to which the guy comes on the year on QAM last week Edmits Edmits that when a one up there to broder the first time when he were you know Voting in the new arena deal with Wayne that he had a 50 50 deal He could add a sweet deal for the heat and the panthers coexist everybody get along stop being selfish stop being printed on us And that when they came back to date in his words well the powers that be which of course means the people at the Harald and whoever else he's in bed with over there they made him an offer he couldn't refuse They put this deal together in date and now that they try to put that thing together Of course he can't go crawling on his hands and he's to Wayne cuz now the heat don't have such a good deal up there Well, why did he lie to them in the first place? Are we supposed to feel sorry for him that he that he stabbed the public in the back and lie through his teeth Mickey? screw on so now is By the way, we got the heat on wio d baby Oh Is the new arena gonna be strictly the panthers? Is not gonna be any other franchise going in there then right that's the only sports it'll be another be concerts They'll be like the old folks who go in there and like have a Colossity bag pole stuff like that It'll be their own everything that's right See people were saying to me last night and I realized I appreciate it that in the president arena You look up their on those those so-called diamond boards or whatever they are up at the ends, you know and they're still the same crappy stuff We had four years ago, but again at the Panthers have no control over That they have no they can't change that the city evidently has the control over to room ever and Nobody can change any that the only thing that they were able to change and thank God for this is The glass anybody else noticed they took the dividers. They've got the new style NHL glass now around the arena So that they take the dividers out which makes it I mean your vision is unimpaired anywhere you see everything Wow, that's great. That's great. All right, and yeah, we're good luck to us.

And also what is happening also that they're trying to Sign tune your your voice on the air The way they have it no it's fine. They're trying to find my voice Sign tune or fine tuna The way they have it no it sounds good. What they're doing what they're doing. What you know what you see is what you get I mean, this is all I got what they were doing is they're putting a lot of beef in your voice Yeah, and it sounded as if you're not knows it sounded better like I have really big balls right Yeah, it sounded like you're under a desk as well Well, it sounds good no, it sounds like it sounds like it sounds like it sounds okay now It sounds back at fam. Yeah. Oh, it sounds like FM now All of our guest three not Roy's walking around here with a perplex look on his face like we have no idea what the problem is and This will give us some to work on. That's I like that. I also want more let me tell you when you have a big build up like this And you have all this fancy very expensive equipment and you make the big move and you make you know You blow the trumpet or whatever you're blowing It's no fun unless you got some witches in the beginning Well, what it proves also is that the first time is not all is it the green it that well, we all know that Trust me and what the anticipation may be great, but we know that once you get in with the second time is even better that's right. I want last thing is that there is a constant humming On the year I said this is a bunch of crap and This started I well I was listening to one many that with the news this is a bunch of who yeah And it also when Is a bunch of who right when when you throw it to jar the home continues as well So are you are you? George it's on full sides. We got a hum job on a year or two Yeah, if you're the man it's on both sides when you're directed jar the home continues So in other words even when I'm on this on right huh say what the hum's gone where was it coming from? New technology from our new technology in other words there was a pot that was open in there somebody was smoking it And they were humming it. They were humming a tune What the be it? Thanks, but we just got the home out. How do you like that for quick for quick service huh? But I don't know how you usually will. Let's are do it yourself project. We rely on the audience you tell us what screwed up and we'll get working on it I'll continue to listen to this and if anything Right if anything changes are called it tomorrow. Listen you sure got the old iod engineering staff meet. I'll tell you that Have a great day pal. See you on. Okay. There you go. Open line in date county if you move real fast 622 to put uiod 622 9463 oh My God, so we got a few little problems in there and for I sit here and I go on and we got all this good stuff and they spent millions of dollars Of course there's gonna be stuff that screwed up nobody wants perfect it's no fun It's boring when you come right down to it if it's perfect What's there to bitch about if it were perfect world we'd all be out of business? Here's Boca hello Hi, hi Neil you're in Boca. Yeah, our first Boca call or how do you like that? I'm happy to be on with you Yeah, and we're happy to be a have you honest the phone line is clear is it yeah, but when I'm on hold It's muffled yeah, okay, so we got about that the guy that was just on with you before Yeah, man, you get it right on the head did he there's uh there's a home a company with your voice Yeah, like whenever you before you come out and like I hear the delay with the home and then you say that Yeah, you know But other than that time's great, so I won't go into that but last night on the DSF Yes, sir. I was able to watch the Panther game on sports channel Florida Right now Let me have to that surprise you described it at sports package. Yeah. I only subscribed to NHL Center ice right So how's how's my got it? Where did you see it? Where did I see it? Yeah, I'm well what the channel Like 300 something well I know I know that but was a 3 19 or 3 60 ready something It was 3 19 3 19 yeah, right and see FL Sports channel Florida right exactly yeah, so I just get that I was wondering you know what happened what happened is that they got their right straightened out See it probably they should have listed it on the package too, okay? And this we ought to mention this for anybody that's got the small dish and it's getting a little bit confused in psychotic And they already admitted they screwed up that Sunday game in the Ranger game at New York So if you don't find it on the center-rise package you will find it on 3 19 until they find a permanent home for sports channel Florida But like even a couple hours before the game like before we left the house right to go to the game right I punched up 3 19 Just to see if anything was on air and sure enough There was nothing on the screen, but it said at the top the program listing Rangers at the Panthers Sports Channel Florida and that's a company with the NHL center ice package What do you mean is that is that where that that's gonna be with the NHL center ice package? It's with a sports package So even if even if you don't have these center ice package if they're televising sports Channel of Florida, it'll still be on 3 19 or wherever they want to putting it to me right got it Okay, hey I say Go front a do-spack yes, sir. I can't request yes, you can't well make it a request today anyway Could be tough, but I'll give it my best shot all right. I don't know if you got it loaded in yet, but it's that soccer goal with Man-ditch and that guy yelling okay pal. Like I said have a great day in a great life Love in the old sea Okay sure open line of broward it so what's the story? I'd like to get a little item the I don't panic You know me as long as they pay me I couldn't give a crap water sounds like but What's the story are we getting a grip on is there what plan huh? Yeah, that's one of our freight of They're in there playing with it guys. That's the problem. Okay. If we address the technical situation It might sound a little bit better, but they're in there dittlin with it. All right. They're used to it We're on the air. We're on the air. What do you know what the hell do you people want? We're on the air. Do you want it to sound good? Jesus talk about a bunch of pushy bastards. They want at the brand new place to not only be on the air But sound perfect on the first day. They're not impressed with our millions of dollars worth equipment And probably the people over there at the old cocks to place over there in North Bay, village Listen to that they're all screwed up. I'll just wait a day or two. Okay, till we're not so screwed up to we get rid of our big hum job Just wait till like a couple of books when they just wait till all the promotion starts Just wait till we actually survive and we do pretty damn good and the log is filled up which it looks pretty good to me right now anyway Oh, yeah, we can't make money with those guys those guys are poised and there are a lot of trouble Speaking of a lot of trouble by the way, we have a lot of fill Henry fans out there and rightfully so fill is great And we miss him a lot and I just wanted to say that fills already in a lot of trouble That's the word he did that Shaquille O'Neill bitty to that Shaquille routine opening night Monday night of KFI and he's in deep crap already How do you like that?

About nine o'clock nine o'clock Yeah, night they were playing the best of Rick and suds while they were playing something of Rick and suds Yeah, and it was all distorted again. It It not I only listened to like five minutes of the Rick and suds thing yeah, but I'm sitting there because it was distorted or he couldn't take anymore well a little about oh, okay But I just want you know I wanted to see what the new transmitter would sound like we don't have the new transmitter yet Are you still transmitting off the off the old piece of crap right Markoni's second well The signal was clear But honey, it was it You know it totally lose the thing yeah, so I don't know I just forget I'd give you a call and let you know and if there was something They were supposed to do to fix it maybe they would no that that that whole problem has to do with the Adette tapes that they gave them the old Cox people they had some dead tapes which are the first ones that ever came out That have been used and twisted and chewed on and waiting for breakfast one morning by some of the engineers and They oh here here you go a transfer some of the material over on this this will be great Make some of your best of us on here and that's what they came out like so and they're actually playing them on the air Wonderful, which should be well aware of this are they going to get them off with Ron and Ron at night No, we got a guy coming You're asking me some guy some out of work guy.

See you wants a new live guy and I also wants them to be good pushy bunch of guys And let me say it again section 106 you're okay in my book Except for that third period last night just put you up a little bit save the 30th and 40th beer until like the overtime And yeah, we did have a lot of people leave early last night and the seat would me that's a mixed bag on a one-hand I get very I get aggravated with people like that because why did you come here? Why did you buy this show and up spending all that money or even you know Rip in the tickets off from somebody else however you got them and And then you stay through like the whole game or most of it and would like five a mixed loises in here What can you say to that? Correct them and and then they leave would like 10 and a half minutes left and one-hundredth of getting they start leaving and they kept leaving And they kept leaving there were thousands of people out of there by the time the regulation ended and over time Forget it so on to one-hand it's depressing, but on the other hand it makes it a little easier to get out of there That's the only negative about one-o-six man. It ain't too easy to get out of that building 11 27 a WOD Mitch Lewis is in the building starting rumors that he's Jewish Hawking entertainment radio 610 WOD You're being very difficult with me this morning We rise Marinette it's waiting It's the same sir something you're back in time Be Korean ice tea Light схono It's black leather jacket Number thirty two and w 44 Alrighty and our writers about instance why it ismatacec a simple craft for its great Tzam awt Chase preguntas that is communities such as Airpetter Democratic. Slame Trace Payton and he has, we don't want to be bothered with any more. Where is the jukebox, crack up the hits, where is Gloria S. Defand when we need her, huh? Because it's not a question of if it's a question of when. They're going to stick their feet deep inside your Bracom. Make no mistake about it. That's the Cox mentality, baby, because nobody that ever worked, it's amazing how consistent they are in hiring. They never heard anybody good. Rawlass holes. Starting with Phil Costan and Henry Barrel. And right on, that is Mike Reneri, Roger Magalin, Mitch Lewis. Who? Alex Benman, well, that case. And the interesting part is, I think they like the Alexander Spenett. What is that? Here's Western. Hello. Western. Going once. Going twice. But we got a lot of these bows those here today. Probably calls for money inside over there. I don't want to say where, but you know what I'm talking about. Probably. Here's South Miami. Hello. South Miami. George. Okay. That's two for two. Otherwise, you think that if we have new equipment, we're going to have new colors that stay on hold. What do you mean by that? They're hanging up, just like they always do. Well, screw them. Here's the Miami on three. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. Did you hear the crowd yelling, let's go rangers? No, I did not. You didn't hear that? No, I did not. No, I didn't because they're one grand fact. I'm glad you reminded me of this. You had to look with a microscope around that arena. See anybody with a ranger jersey in the old days before we had this tremendous demand for tickets and all these season tickets sold. Every time we played the rangers down here, there were 80 zillion rangers fans with all the ranger uniforms and the jerseys and all the rangers that go rangers. I never heard anything. And I saw, I think, three people in a whole arena with ranger jersey. You know, they were awfully loud. I was hearing it on my TV. Let's go a ranger. It's like this. I don't think so. I think they were doing a let's go Panthers. I think you're dreaming, man. Well, I heard a little both. Or anyway, I saw the VP for Sports Channel on their channel 33. Yeah. And he was saying that they're negotiating with TCI and that TCI is already getting off the stuff where they want to get as a premium channel. So I guess we might end up all right after. So another is this looking good? Is that what he said? I'm sorry. He said it's looking good. Yep. Oh, yeah, I told you. It's not a question of if it's a question of when? Exactly. They got to give it to you. There are too many people who have been calling and faxing and jumping up and down and threatening to cancel their premium channels and to whatever else it takes, they want it. And I want to thank you, Neil. And you're welcome because you, you will start it up and apparently it's working. That's right. On the guy. And I want to say to these, uh, New York Rangers, why don't you go back to New York? You two bastards. All right. You take care, Neil. See you, Julio. Okay. We have an open line in the date at 6 to 2. I have no idea what these numbers are. Good thing we got a main, uh, Braille on this thing here because I have it's going to take a while folks. It's going to take a little time. This is basically a dry run today. We just have the dry runs over here today, but it'll take a little bit of time. How about this one I was looking for? I'll get my finger on it. Here's the Miami. Hello, when is Diaz? Okay. Another one. Very interesting. Open line in date 6 to 2 9463. Here's plantation. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Long time Ranger fan first time caller. Okay. My condolences, um, what's going to be a long year for you? Well, I've talked about that, but the, uh, I have the little dish, have the Sony dish. And, uh, I just want to save the Ranger fans that call you all the time that say, uh, the so-called Ranger fan. I love the Rangers all these years, but now the fans that you're, uh, hate them. They're not true Ranger fans because it's days in your blood, your entire life. I love the fan through 75, 75, 75, and it's a week, but when the Rangers play, I can't do that much. I understand that. Anyway, I met about my leafs losing the four to two last night. They're down two nothing in the third. They tie it up and they give up a goal with two and a half minutes left and an empty net goal to get it. How do you stand when the leafs play the Panthers? I pull for the leafs. Oh, okay. Well, you're not even- That's why I said you. I said I can relate to it because I've been a leaf fan for 38 years now. I'm not changing that allegiance, no matter what. Well, I'm a 206 year Ranger fan. I feel the same way I just can't do it. There's some things in life that are more important than others. And to me, the leafs are right up there near the very top. Panthers are close, but not only with the leafs. You're just like me. Well, this weekend was a nightmare with the disc Saturday night. I had to work and I taped the game. I went to tape it because I wanted to see Grezki's first game as a Ranger. Yeah. Came home to four hours of program, not available in the area. Right. Well, they screwed up on Saturday. What happened with me was I ordered with my remote when it was $109 and my machine never registered. So I didn't get it. You know something the same thing happened with me. But it's because I called him up. I forget which night I guess it was Sunday night. I called him up and or Monday, Monday night. Which year they had a couple of games on and they said not available in your area or whatever they'll come down to bottom. And so I called her up and after bitching her out for five minutes, he says, I'll guess what, if you ordered it by remote, a lot of these never went through. So I'll put it in a bingo. It came out while I was on the phone with her. Yeah, they did it. They did the same thing for me, but I was so I read about Missing Grezki's premiere that they gave me a $30 credit. So I believe me, it was a real bonus for you because you didn't miss any thing. Well, he did nothing. It was a pretty good game. It looked like. But he did nothing. Well, he did last night though, but that's a different role. He did what? He, he had about six premier scoring opportunities that he set up. Did he, did he, did he, did he, did he go in? No, because B's is in that and the ranges just start used to get in passes that quick and they're not finishing yet. Yeah. Well, he had a chance to tip a couple of many. It took great scoring chances himself and he shot him wide. He had a great chance. They're short handed toward the end of the overtime and Beezer stone in there. I don't want to get real close last night. You can see Kovalov and grains with their eyes lighting up on some of those passes that they get like, oh, I see what's going to be happening here. So it's going to gel soon. I don't think so. I hate to break the news to you. That's what the blue star last year too. But this man, he's still, you know, you still see flashes of the brilliance and the real nifty passes and some dangerous moves. But he's a shadow of what he was in a day. And listen to me. As soon as he takes his first real solid hit, that's going to be it. He's going to be useless. Oh, we could go on for hours about this. It's stamina was pretty decent last night and you're right. I agree. He has a little luck. He's a pussy. He's a little pussy. He's a little pussy and as soon as somebody hits him, he's always holding that helmet. He's running into the bench. I got a headache. He's a win. He's not used to the physical kind of play that he's going to encounter in our division and our conference. It's a whole different ball game. Well, it's a totally different ball game. We get to Panthers. That's for sure. One more thing. We look pretty good last night, by the way. Absolutely. It's a real great rivalry. I'll rock a look. Good. Melon B. Niedermire has really booted up. He's played two real big games in a row. We're looking pretty damn tough. Hey, I love him. We're going to ask him played smart and good last night. No stupid penalties. Book a bullman and got in the deal. You don't have to convince me. We look good. They look real good. But the other thing was when I called on Sunday night after the Panthers range of fiasco on the disc, they said, I don't know if this has been resolved, but they told me they'd only acquired the rights for Sports Center for Panthers home games. So, as it is, I don't have any sports center. I'm a cable. I don't think so. When you talk to those bozos, then, or what they're talking about. I could run that place, but it may be one more thing. QAM yesterday, during one of your commercials, it's so called all sports all the time. Yeah. Opening night for the Panthers, they're talking about, what do you think the final score is going to be if it is upcoming, you know, Florida or whatever it is? If I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you mind if I see you. That's important. We're really psyched about that game man. I'm a PCU against the Girl School, against the Hurricanes. On the way home from the game, I turned it back on it nine o'clock and they're still talking about the football game after they had this controversial icing call that they could have talked about for an hour and a half. Right. Even in a paper here, you know, icing, chills, party, all the articles are in about what a bogus call it was. It's the Dave Hides is the Panther players are too classy to cry sour grapes, but it was a crappy call and anybody who knows the game knows it was a crappy call, but they don't know the game. It was a crappy call. They don't know the game at QAM. That should be the. Maybe the new slogan. They should have a Billboard campaign saying, we talk sports, but we just don't know the game. They avoid it like the play. Right. Thanks Neil. At least a homer nose his crap. Have a great day. Get it, yeah. Crap is his middle name. Hey, stupid. Exactly. We have two open lines in Broward at 767Wild7679463. We got all the bugs worked out here yet or what? We're working on them. Okay. We are working on them feverishly. We got engineers on a ceiling. We got engineers on the floor. We got an engineers in Uranus. We got engineers up here. We got an engineer. We got engineers crawling over the dam. Place. Because we're so intent that we're going to make things right. We want it to be spectacular. We don't want it to just be your ordinary pedestrian bunch of bullcrap. We want it to be spectacular bullcrap. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. What do you think about Mark Fust? Well, I said here. It's when can we get rid of him? What does that mean? Oh, we need to get rid of him. That's twice he's done this. What do you mean? Now, let me ask you a question. What referee and league do you think does good by us? Anybody? Well, actually, the guy was the, you're going to tell you something that Richard Trotchier that frog who was the referee and it fell at off the exhibition game. I remember that New Jersey game last year, he hates us. Hate us. I think most of the officials hate us because we're like an upstart team. We're not supposed to be so good. We're not supposed to win and they stick it to us. We can't send those tapes to league or anything and do anything about the... You can't send tapes into the league on an icing call. No way Jose. I mean, that icing call costs us a game. No question about it. I was harling. I was screaming. But you know something? You know something? Well, it will still take the point. I know, we'll take the point, but we would prefer two points. I mean, it was on the two minutes left. Right. And we had it. Amen. I'm with you. Yeah, that's all I got. I just want to invent my frustration with the referee and the NHL. Okay. That's how next time it comes down here like breaks the leg. Literally. We have an open line in date. 62 to the WOD62 to 9463. So Roberto hung up before and we have a lot of our lady friends out there who aren't calling to welcome us to our new surroundings. And they say, hey, this was really great. What's your name? The blade run a girl who I'm sure was at that game. You know, an interesting thing in my new seats now. Either everybody has developed a sudden hatred toward me, which is possible. Or it's just too hard to have access to where I'm sitting right now. It's quite a great down to it. It's kind of pleasant. Kind of a breath of fresh air. Scott the lawnman came down to say, hi, you can come anytime you want Scott. Make no mistake about it. Oh, so when did we get home from the game last night? I go to let my dogs out and guess what's on the fence? I see my golden retriever jumping up in a year like starting to play a boot boss. There's a big possum sitting on my fence. And that damn thing was ready to hop down and do some serious damage. And if you would have gone after the little log out of the set, hey, go ahead and go to it. Have I ever have a possum on your thing? I've had a few cones around the neighborhood, but no possums. What are you looking at me? Haven't you been in my neighborhood? You've seen where I live. There's woods out there. It's very rural. There's wild animals out there. It's still a rural. They're always hanging around the dumpsters. What? The possums are the cones. Both. Mark Furman said. Oh, by the way, anybody see that last night. I missed the coast of the game. Mark Furman said that it was very sorry. And she said, why did you say that word? Why did you say that? He said, what word, Kike? Anyway, it's 1144 at WIOD. Hawking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. When did that go down? Can he come be anything now? Oh, what he's ugly face. I'm kind of down to three. When did that go down? Go to bottom of the ocean. Oh, must gotta see it for stay. We'll have nothing left to say. Worked at a false idol entrance. That even a stunt major will finally smoke these in cigars. And folks in Albana will race when they trade in those green 1950 cars. When they fell, it was down. And they are blocked, a moonista. We'll make every day Monday for Sunday. Oh, just like Salito, he can't be. Oh, what he's ugly face. On Canal Bendit. Dammit. Okay, 1149, that's the idea. We want to start like we're in the Twilight Zone. So everybody says, everything sounds great. You're full of crap. Audio, Oshan and Provocca, Turum, Goi, I'm cut to baloney. Everything is fine. Everything is just fine. Okay. And like that scholar thing, we just thought I haven't heard that. And they are cool in zage. I haven't heard that. Yeah, we keep coming back to that again. Keep coming back to that again. So anybody out there know anything about possums? Are they like friendly? Do they have rabbis or what? They have like long nasty teeth, too, by the way. Just thought I would mention that. They're fantastic. They are nasty. And they're fearless. They are fearless. That thing was ready to hop down and just to chew that dog, do a little bits and pieces. Here's, like, look at that. Okay, like where is this thing? Is this thing over here? Is that phone thing? There it is. Way to help there on the sea. And look who we got now. Can graduate? And she didn't even hang up on me. No. It's the Nazi lady. How you doing? Great. Wonderful to hear you. How does it sound on your radio suite? Oh, my radio, it sounds perfect. So what's the problem with these people? I think they're calling from Cox. I think they're the Cox people. Yes, I think you're right. Yeah. Hey, you know, we have raccoons in my neighborhood too. You have Coons in your neighborhood? Yes, we do. Yeah. They can into our trash every day. Really? Yes, they do. It's terrible. Why you should stop leaving all the atkins stuff in there. I know. I like that. We're keeping our raccoons on a slim fast diet. Really? I wouldn't be surprised to see that like on Jenny Jones pretty soon. Coons on a slim fast diet. You never know. Yeah. But anyway. Anyways, I just wanted to call to congratulations and sorry. I think it in yesterday. But why forget are you into our panthers or not? I forget that. You're not yet. You're still. It's only been four years and we can't convert you from Mark Grace. Well, I watch the playoff. And I'm getting there. I'm getting there. I really am. I have to understand the game though. Because I think Luke Robotide, if you honest with you, it looks a little bit better than Mark Grace at this stage. It could be wrong, but he looked okay to me. Maybe I have to take a look. And Nicholas, Sun's Droom of the Rain, even though they are Rangers. Right. Yeah. Okay. Did you watch it last night? No. Did you watch the Furman? Did you watch Furman? Yeah. And what did he say? He said, oh, he just is so embarrassed that he ever used the word. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I'm not. No. And then they said, and you know you called Robert Chippin. And he wrote, you. Yeah. And he's like, yeah. Sorry, too. Is that what he said? You called him a Jew? Yes, he did. Well, isn't he a Jew? I guess he is. Yeah. He didn't apologize for that one though, only for the other word. And how about what's his name? They're from Maharva. What the hell is his name? The other attorney. Oh, she didn't ever talk about that. Dershiew it. He's another Jew. Yeah. I mean, if you're supposed to call a spade a spade, why can't you call a Jew? I don't get it. Well, which is not. Sounds like a double set of standards. That's right. So watch out for the old possum. Hey, I will. And it's great hearing your voice. He still needs to be still. You still don't want to. You still do a new thing? Of course. I can't wait till your first remote. I'll have to show. Oh, my God. She's going to have her coming out party. So to speak. So to speak. Well, that's great. Keep it up sweetheart. Thanks, you too. See you soon. Speaking of seeing you soon, we got, uh, what's today today? The, uh, the eighth. What is it? The, uh, ninth? Which means in about three weeks, we start our center one for ninety six thing, which, uh, this year, trust me. One I've told you believe me. We've had a lot of good the CDs and stuff we put out in the past this year. We'll far, far surpass anything we've ever put out. We got the the best of Neil is usual and this one's got phenomenal stuff. I mean, the best of everything from the past year. We got Neil's nuggets, which has the bridge tender. It's got, uh, jacket and a box. It's got stuff that we can't play on the air. It's got a hole. It's got like phone calls. It's got all kinds of garbage on there. Then of course, Rick and so this year instead of having a CD, which nobody wants. They're going to have a video with a lot of the, uh, pay phone challenge crap on here, which will be great. And then, uh, and I'm positive this is going to be blow everybody else's stuff away in terms of being the best seller. Or be the fill Henry his last IOD one obviously that fill and handy were kind enough to put together and allow us to use this stuff for us and are one this year.

Okay Congratulations, and you're moved to your new studio. Thank you, and I thank you so much for the Ackens diet. Yeah, last year I launched about 20 pounds and I'm back on it now because I gained a little I want to thank you for I'm getting me interested in hockey. I don't really know a lot about it yet But my husband and my son, you know, have went a couple of times this year and it was great for them So I love you Neil, but I also want to say one thing Neil I when you love somebody you don't always agree with everything they do you know yeah, you're a little hard or I'm black people Meaning what well you know like I there is something the something that you say like I understand that is a joke And I don't really take it personally, but I've heard like other black people calling and and sort of give you a hard time When you you say about like complex it black yeah, you did you know like them, but you said those dark ones, you know get away Something that you know that's you know that's me. I just said get away. I just said if they would just if the black people in America would lighten up a little bit Yes, that's a good idea. I think we get all of forward to lighten up just a little bit. I understand, but that's you Huh don't you think that's true? Yeah, I think so but I just wanted to let you know you know That's like a very serious and sensitive issue in the black community. What is that? What's the issue of complex? Why is that? It's a thing it's an internal thing. I think you think that maybe that's why a lot of people in the black community Is you call it don't like Michael Jackson? No, or maybe because he's a child molestor and what are the other because he's a Peter file? Yes, I'd say that might be or maybe both of the above Yeah, but I just want to tell you it's sort of like it's like I said it's a sensitive issue when When especially when you know a white person said that it's sort of like a sense How about in the malado community is a complex and a big issue there? I don't know. I don't I'm not familiar with any malado community. Well, I don't know any black community either I mean there's like Liberty City at over town and there there's north Miami and wherever else black people are There's Fort Lauderdale there's plenty of black people in Fort Lauderdale.

I didn't care about them before Why should I care now that I hope FSU scores about 80 points? Oh, you're an FSU fan? No Because the hurricanes are gonna kill them. I think well dream on man You don't think dream on it's gonna be a long aggravating afternoon. Do you go to UM?

What do you think about Brian Blades going that winning touchdown for Seattle? I'd beat the dolphin Sunday That is a little depressing, but you're already pressing right the dolphins are gonna come back and win this week. Yeah in Buffalo in Buffalo Erickson will throw about three touchdown passes and Dawson's will win 21 seven You're okay my book pal. The eternal optimist have a great life Okay, no feel too bad on Saturday. It's gonna be ugly that oh, I fsu is it I know FSU had a little trouble. They've been spottering early in the game, but guess what they keep winning them And a hercunes. I mean, they did beat up on a girl school Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh came back and beat up on temple Which I thought was a growtestly anti-Semitic act and it was so embarrassing that temple bootlead in that game like 16 times that the coach quit and said If we're gonna lose to a team like that then Screw it. Gonna be a long Saturday man. Just get used to it 12 29 at Wiod Entertainment radio 16 WIO You were card you play harder and when the heat is on your losing crucial bodily fluids Fluids you've got to replenish if you want to keep going Doing with urine the all natural sports strike that gives back what nature takes away Great game Jack.

I guarantee a tomorrow which I will be eating in here of course tomorrow or somewhere around here Your tea by tomorrow will have these bachelor's straightened out with the food situation make no mistake about that Here is a four-laterdale hello Four-laterdale going once going twice hello hello Neil yes, sir. Hey how's it going great? Haven't talked to you guys since the playoffs ended last year Out of town this summer and I just got back in and just wanted to wish you just a time for the panthers great start Yeah, right excellent excellent haven't missed a game yet So but last night's game was a little disheartening, but that's well when the lines of Inscrews you went out when a miserable frog in a back-stabbing Russian can aspire to get together to take the Again the winaway from you it is very disheartening. Yeah, make no mistake about it Like you said earlier though we we got a point out of it and I'm sure we'll we'll encounter quite a few more situations like that But I just kind of have to take them as they come In the course healy all of a sudden had to come to Miami and find the good stuff whatever was that he was on last night because I've never seen anything like that Performance he pulled off All right the last time I saw anybody well It wasn't really that long ago when Beezer and Patrick Frog got involved at last game we played the avalanche game for That gold that gold 10 thing was I would say on the same par with the way that he Lee played last night He was unbelievable. Yeah, that was that was a good move by the Rangers coach to put healing in there I was I was really hoping with see yeah Richter, you know play the I Richter shot his load in the world cup Man he played phenomenal in there. He was unconscious. He was great and then You know, I think he had a tremendous letdown when a season started he played very week to first two games He gave the Bruins for and he opened it. We got five on him on Sunday so that's nine and two games and they figure just Cool as jets a little wild stick Helian there and he was great. Yeah, I've got the Panthers are able it You know at least get get a goal and I don't know if you remember last season it seems like when the Panthers were in there They're a little swamp towards the second half of the season yeah, we couldn't stick it in the ocean Yeah, it's it seemed like we were always running in the hot gold tender So right hopefully this is just like I thought we looked out standing last night the atmosphere in the joint was like a playoff game The team looks like a real honest a good in this team. We you know where we're not anybody that says we play boring now I'm sorry. I don't buy that. I mean the third period sure we had a shut it down a little bit We knew we had to protect that one. I'll leave but the first two periods we outplayed them dramatically We had break away after break away our passing was really good. No first two periods it kind of vanished. I'm third But we're looking good. This is a real team They did look excellent and I don't care what anybody says. I mean our like Brad Smith but these people are on me Said oh yeah, we'd rather have him than shepherd shepherd is a pure goal score He came you know, he's considering he's been out for a while He looked pretty good to me last night. He looked just fine. I was glad to have him back You want that hey man. That's for sure I guess the only the only negative point last night about the whole game had to be that That announcer I've heard a couple people rag what's his name net miss or whatever yeah He was a complete idiot He referred to the hockey players as ball players last night. I had a boy, Ned What a jackass what a bozo I didn't know they played with balls in the hockey at least not down on the ice Yeah, in his case. I think it's an exaggeration Yes, so uh that and the only other thing I wanted to touch on is a Rimmer I like Rimmer. I don't want to give the guy a hard time But we're gonna get a pedally upcoming here Looks like the little time retaliated at something that went on with he and Rhett Warner and the fanters will get a power plug Ryan Spurlin, the fanters have the net empty off He leases Bobby Fitzgerald That's like pedaling the peppers are on the board and leave one cup of it Oh Yeah, you were saying there you go. No, not not a hallway, but he has this one liner that he says like every game Whether especially when they're away when the crowd gets into it and something happened Yeah, the other team he always goes much to the delight of the crowd That just drives me nuts when he says you know what you don't have to remind me of it's marr It's like marr of Albert with that he hears it from the crowd if I ever have to hear that again from our Albert I'm personally gonna take care of his ugly Yes, he hears it from the crowd get out of here when that new York crap get out of our face bar You make me sick go ahead some uh home and talk to something get out of here Well, maybe you're frimbers listening to he'll change he'll change it up for something. Yeah, hold your breath But other than that he's a great announcer and I'm he's taking his Mike Lang lessons right now He's working on it all right. We'll see him. I guess on Saturday. He's doing his no I don't think that game is on so he'll be he'll be wandering around saying to everybody anybody know me I'm the famous announcer. I did I did see him at one of the play out. I believe it was the Colorado game last last year before one of the one of the games before yeah before the game started And I want to have two when I talked him for a minute or two and he had a little drink going He was he was feeling pretty happy so yeah He was a nice guy though. He's okay. He has his moments. Have a great day pal That's what hanks is we have an open line in date at I keep wanting to give those old numbers and I haven't done a once and I'm not gonna do it again Just keep saying to yourself just concentrate real hard 622 W I O D 622 9463 and we got an open line two of them in Broward 7679463 767 Shoot it weekly the words of things when goal comes on for Rasu and I'll see you in the same players There's one you with a fucking thing behind that offensive driver going for the net one you as an angle back Enter Oh, see based her very like a rated meal and the penguins lay turn out in Mario let me you he just seemed to snap Free frame and be fair Come on Mikey a better work on it a little bit pal Let's go to Miami on whatever this is hello don't kneel You're first show with a new building is a mask of a show how you doing Don't co-y on how do you like that That's the only thing I can find real quick, but there it is I just wanted to tell you I live in the area and Deli Den is there.

And the high school kids, the older ones. I guess the older they are, the number they get. They go like real early. And I look out there. And there's this big skinny kid standing in the middle of the street looking. And obviously he's the one to rang the bell. And I just kind of saw it out there as I had thrown my clothes on real quickly. And I got my newspaper and gave him a dirty look and walk back inside. And so tomorrow or in future days, if he decides he'd like to, you know, come in early in the morning and bring the doorbell, I might just have a little surprise for him. I might just a little number on the belly, you know what I'm saying? Or something else. But hey, that's the way it goes out in the Accus. Boy, they got a real good sense of humor. They're good old bunch of guys. Here's a dear field. Hello. It's going on now. Yes, sir. First, let me see what a joke it is that the 24 hours board station has had qualified guy. You can even speak hockey too. Right. But they got Ned Smith. He knows Peter Zedzel. I'm getting them in a second. I was there in Washington, occupied by 22 years. And what I did that is the worst trio of hockey and out in sports in hockey and maybe in sports. They're worse than Carter and Jerry Randolph. Last night, you would never hear someone like John David's is a, something. John would have been said at the end of the game, the referee goes over the ringers at that exit and he goes, he's probably going back to the hotel and I'm on the same bus. Just totally on professional. Who said that, Denise? Yeah, Denise. And we're rumours no better. He's a Homer also. Oh, what? He's a Homer. Homer. Yeah. What I mean, you're, I mean, you got a good hockey team here, but you got I. What's wrong with being a Homer? Are you telling me that J.D. don't shield for the ranges? Come on. Let's get serious now. He wouldn't have the come on. He wouldn't have the job for Fox if he did. Oh, come on. He does not. Well, not when he's doing the, the Fox games, but during the MSG, telecast, come on. Very well, not very hard on the ranges. He's, he's, he's very down on them right now. He's a realist. He's not like these, you know, rumour who think, you know, just winds about everything. You know, everything's an anti, you know, you know, anti, you know, anti, uh, ranges. I mean, the hit, the, the only on the half, I mean, he made it out to be murder. I mean, the guy has to protect himself along the board, too. Yeah. He looked ahead, Meshie hit him and, uh, he didn't kill him. He could have drove me away. Anyway, it was a very ugly and very nasty and potentially a very potentially, huh? It compared to Claude Lemme was crazy. Well, Lemme did it, not. He hit him from behind and the guy, the guy got off. He didn't protect himself. And even here, you even heard the coach say, it's almost clean. Well, I disagree with you. Obviously, the league did too. And for them to give Meshie a two games. I mean, the league is very, as you know, very, the leery of giving the super stars, any suspensions at all. He gave him two games. Brian Burke must have thought it was pretty damn bad. It was a spend. Hitting from behind, as you know, if you're a real hockey fan and you are hitting from behind is unacceptable. It is, but it's also the place responsibility, uh, forgely. Well, well, to a point, but I mean, you know, you can only, uh, you know, you don't have eyes in the back of your head. And I realized, Huff knew he was coming, which is what saved him on that play, but there was also the chance he didn't know, okay? And if he wouldn't have known, he could have been right in Chris Draper's shoes. Skates. Yeah, I mean, I'll think Meshie, we go first, throw it like that, you know, let me do it. But, uh, I don't know, and I, I think, I think you, I think you're jumping to gun a little bit too quick on the rainers, you know, knocking down Grep's. Yeah, he's definitely not the same player he was, but the guy. Well, listen, I, you talk about people are realists. I admit, I confessed that I hate Wayne Grep's ski. I hate him like poison. I was screaming of a game last night. Every time he made a bad pass, I was yelling. But the fact is, I'm telling you very realistically, as a guy who watches a lot of hockey, I got two satellite dishes. I watch more games in one year than most people see in a lifetime. Wayne Grep's ski, I don't think he's going to be any great shakes for the Rangers, and they're going to root the day that they got him. Well, I, you know, you might be right there, but let's look when he did last year, you had a hundred and two points this year with a bunch of stiffs out now, like a king that was folding. He was, he was almost single handedly responsible for dismantling the kings. He's the one that forced into the trade-away coffee and the trade-away a robot tie and make all the deals that they did because he doesn't, and also it's going to be very interesting to see how he had robot tie get along on the Rangers because they hate each other like poison. That's true. He's a disruptive force, you know, when you pay somebody that much money who's at toward the end of the line and he comes in and gets disrupts the chemistry of the team, it's not a good deal. I'm telling you, you want you mark my words. You noticed robot tie was Benchler's sign that they're a period. I was hoping he was, he was Benchler's. Yep. I don't know what that's all about because he was the most dangerous guy they had on the ice to first two periods that I said to John on the way home, I said, I didn't ever saw robot tie in the third period. They benched him. Yep. John, he makes 6.2 million dollars here, right? Look at the triangle on the ice, who was on the ice, covalve, grace, social. He wasn't one of the six players on the ice. He just got through San Nadie. He didn't play the third period. So, I'll get you one of the players on the ice. That's what I'm just saying. There's a big superstar, 20 million dollars. Yeah. Well, I mean. Like I said, it's going to be a long disruptive year in New York because he knows that they don't want him there, they feel like you do. He's not going to play well. He knows Gratzky hates him. I'm just telling you, you want to be a realist just to get used to it. I wouldn't mind getting in him, but you know, you look at the scene, they had nine guys in the world cup, so they've only had one preseason game together. So they had they need to do that. Yeah, they got a lot of great talent on the team, but they had the same, a lot. Most of the same talent last year and he still, they got problems, believe me. Just a lot of great individuals doesn't make a great team. Oh, what had it that year, right? All right, no, let's talk about the... Good luck to pal. Okay, don't need it. We have an open line in Brower that 767, WIOD 767, 9463. You look at the Panthers. We don't other than the B's, or we don't have any super-superstar. I mean, right, Shepherd, of course, is a 50-goal score, but you wouldn't put him in a same league with a Messier or a Gretzki or a guy like that. But, you know, great teams don't necessarily have super-superstar's on him. That is it, me. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Uncle Neil. Yes, I am. Welcome to Hollywood. I'm the Tick-Tack man. And I know all the restaurants right by you because I live there for 18 years. Okay. Hollywood, great restaurants in the shopping center, right west of you is Flores, Wands, And Vito's, and then on the other side on Sterling Road, you have Delhi Den in the Salvoz. Right. And if you go up the Griffin Road, you have a place called Hot Digity Dog and Vincent's on the water. Hot Digity Dog, that's a wini place? Yeah, great. Chicago or a Brett. Great. Yeah. You can do the engines and get our wini out of the bun. If I get George's number off the phone or your number off the phone, or have all these places in your food. Outstanding. Okay. You're on hold immediately. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. Okay, bye. Line 6, okay. Or whatever line that is, yeah, Line 6, George. There is the food man. I told you we get it all hooked up into people out there. Now that money he makes it, he keeps snoring for free food on the air. It's so disgusting. Yeah, you're just jealous is what you are. I got my two nice atkins, cheesecakes from Lorenzo's right here on the floor with all my stuff. Party favors and blow horns and blow hearts and all the other good stuff. All right. There you go. Even he's all psyched. So what's the deal that I defo is going to be coming in here? That should be pretty exciting. I think defo can probably turn on a microphone. I think defo can probably come in here and sit in front of the thing. Is that thing hooked up at all? George, is that unplugged? What? That mic. The one on the abulment. It should. What numbers it on. How can it be plugged in? Can't be plugged. You're asking me. Yeah. But this is mic number one. Wouldn't that also be mic number one? Excuse us for our tech conversation folks. By the way, Bob Greene's an asshole. See, I'm not going to unleash it all in the first day because I want to keep them on their toes day by day. I'm going to like, has different things come back to my mind. Like the story about the first and the second Vegas trips. And various other in the sort of center, like don't bother coming in to work tomorrow because you didn't play a few promos. I've got stories about Bob Greene and about Bob Neal and about that whole thing. The way they blew our nearly out. They didn't even let them come back and say goodbye in the year after 17 years. The way they signed a new contract for another year. And then like about a month later, just a matter of weeks later. They blew him out of there and then had to pay him off for a year. That's good business. But I wonder why they couldn't make any money with this station. Huh? Sign him up for another year and then oh, by the way, Mike, don't bother coming to work anymore. We'll send you a check in a mail. But nice knowing you. Thanks for the 17 years up your ass. That's the Cox people, baby. And see, and they're on mine. I'm sure because because anytime there's a disagreement, both parties always rationalize and justify both parties always believe they're right. Anytime there's an argument in this agreement, whatever, all depending on their perspective. So I'm sure in their minds, they think that they were great to everybody. But it's just such a strange coincidence that virtually everybody, everybody over the last goddling those how many years who's worked for that, you know, it was no good. Everybody wasn't good enough for them. And sooner or later in one form or another, everybody got it up the... Correct them and whether they liked it or not. So that's the old Cox way, which I think there's a really interesting 40 in significance that a whole deal, but you think we're it out. Here's Plent. So you got some stuff there? That guy's going to get y'all hooked up. He's going to do what he can. Mark, hold your breath. What do you mean? What do you mean by that? You don't believe that tomorrow we're going to have a feast in here, the... Oh, but today. Hey, I'm going to my house. My mother's and I got two icons, cheesecakes. You're the... I'm the rest of the world. Grow you guys. You don't understand. They don't want to send the food unless they know I'm going to eat it. But what time is your show on? They don't care about your puny little off my comments in there with your little plugs. If Neil gets us, oh man, this is great. Even if it blows, you know, if I... Then they send the free food. You've got to finger out how to do it. There you go. Okay, let's kill ourselves. Let's do plantation. Hello. Hey, I'm not going to get chronic on you, but I had to call back because that guy said, Rob. Call back. Yeah, I called earlier, but that guy just called said, Roboty was benched, but he was injured in the third period. Yeah, he played green. This guy says he's been watching hockey for 22 years. Look, Roboty was the most dangerous player on the ice for either team in a first to appear. He came real close to score in a couple of goals. He was, he was playing great. Well, he got a last duration above his right ankle when he collided with Scrooven and somebody else by the bench. About 11 minutes, 11 to 30 cut his leg. Because I commented, we were driving home and I said to my friend, John, I said, you know, I wonder what happened with Roboty because he was, he was scared and I had a lot of me all night. He was playing great. Yeah, I came home and watched. And this guy says they benched him. This typical Ranger fan, man. He talks about dealing with reality. See what I was talking about wannabes. Yeah. I came home and watched it on rewind and it was educated and he would watch John Davidson on the rewind broadcast of 1130. He would have seen all that. There you go. That's all. I rest my case. Bye bye. And needle nose is still an asshole. Thanks for the info pal. Got it. See there you go. We got the good stuff. Oh, we got to people. You can't fool this audience because the hockey people are the New Rogers people, whether you like it or not. Over there at QAM. Oh, and by the way, Jeff Moss has a message to Jeff Moss has a message for some of the people in the Panther organization, which I don't want to mention any names. But Jeff Moss says he'd rather be a, what do you say? Something that an asshole, like a referee, what the first part was. How do you like that? Oh, you know what? I should have played. I should have played. Where the hell is it? I should have played this. He's a man behind the mic and he loves a good fight. He's on set at words and they come out just right. He's a hockey man. He's on set at words and they come out just right. He's a hockey man. So he can go to coast to coast. And if you don't go in corner, he hates you the most. Great. Yeah. I played the minor leagues. I coach a Boston brood. So if you're asking me, I think the games in ruins. Guys don't fight. They don't fight. Check it's like watching the Nordic stuff there and quee back. Right. Now, let me tell you something right now because, uh, Rachel. He's got a 16-power. He's no cream, but I like the show and harder when he sees rub stuff. You say he's nasty, say he shouldn't be hurt. When it comes to hockey, he gets the last word. I'm going to tell you some minutes the guys on his truth. Rachel. Rachel. I'll tell you something else. Bizarre. No good. Don't like them. Great. Bon Hell, man. Worst rap I've ever seen. Great jam. Europe, it's a nice place to visit but just stop standing as hockey players. Great. I've enjoyed coasts or he'll drop him with just about anyone. I'm only guys who don't like fight. Are you pressed? I'll play that right now. Great. Oh. Okay. It's 115 at WIOD. They're 10 at WIOD. Hi there. How you doing? What's going on? I got something for us like a money. Bring us a bag of money. We're very friendly. Here's a mirror. Hello. Mirror. Gone? Asked. I'm in the mirror. Okay. You know, they're here. They're all over the place. Here's Pembroke Pines. Hello. Welcome to Brower. Thank you so much. I had the call. I had to wish you a welcome and we're glad you're here. Yeah.

Have a great to strumming sandwich. Thank you so much. See you, pal. That was beautiful. Two open lines a day which really pisses me off. I'll tell you that right now. There are no diet sodas. So how about a nice glass of ice water from the cooler? Did I just hear you say I'm sure that my hearing must be going? I hear you say there are no ing diet sodas. Is that what you said? Yes. There are no ing diet sodas. Well, I really frost my fan ass. I'll tell you that right now. I'm not. Huh? Diet 7 up, which is what I'm drinking. Yeah, that's what I asked for. Diet 7 Adam. Thank you. That's what he just stuck his Jewish head in the door said. What do you want? I said Diet 7 up. If there are no diet sodas, how can there be Diet 7 up? Mr. What line would you be speaking, huh? Hey, that was your Jewish friend Adam that came in here and said that we didn't have a man's job to an infant, okay? But he's probably all crumbling out of that great news. He just told us a moment or two ago. That was f***. Party time. F***. All right. Sports fans. I have no right. No, that's not the one. All right. There we go. All right. All right. All right. All right. Oh, man. Can you do stuff with this thing, huh? All right. All right. I have no right. I have no right. I have no right. All right. I totally, we got some. See, I'm not going to crack out the good stuff on the first day. I'm just going to use the, used to the surroundings now getting my ass comfortable in this chair, but you just wait till we start doing some heavy duty crab. Oh, yes, sir. So how's about a diet 7 up Adam? And thank you so much for making my life very beautiful. What was the problem with that? Why was that said to complicated transaction? A diet soda. Can I ask you a question? Not being from New York, which you aren't either, but you think you are. Diet soda can be like diet any flavor, can it? Is this look at this can? Look at this fat can, okay? Did you say that? No, but you said a diet soda. And diet 7 up since that's the only one in the machine. You're getting a good education at him and wait till the afternoon. You're going to really learn a lot. In case you haven't already learned it. Here's a Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Going once. What is it, you find? What is it, you find? What? What is it? It's Hollywood on three. Are we all losing our minds, George? Because I get the feeling. I get the feeling now on autopilot, okay? Looks like three to me. They're just not answering. We have this all new equipment. Same old asshole callers. I don't agree with you. I think there's a problem there. Trust me. We have two open lines. Both in date. 622Wild. 6229463. Do we, by the way, speaking of that? Oh, there's somebody on the screen. Oh, there's somebody on there. There's somebody on that, baby. Okay. 6229463. And date. Here's a tamarack. Hello. Me, sir. I thought that, you know, what's his name? Needle nose. Last night. I don't think he was a factor at all for them at all. I don't know. Very minimal. Like I said, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt. He made a couple of lovely little passes. He was a little dangerous around that. He had a couple of scoring chances. He got the second assist on a time goal, which is no big deal. And that's it. He wasn't a major factor. You're right. We handled him very well. Listen, I used to be, and I'll say that. I have to say that used to be in Islander Femble when I was a kid. When they were like in the, uh, in the, uh, dynasty. Right. The four cups. In the Denise pop band, Daseo. Yeah. And then Denise pop. And then until until, of course, needle nose and his friend, Medzi, a knock to soft. And then, of course, I got out of the love of hockey after that. Because I was so upset. Yeah. But, uh, I don't know. He looks so old. He's, he, he, he, he, he looks like he's, he's, he's, he's really on it. I don't know. I don't know. It looks old. He is old. That's true. And all these people that keep trying to, you know, recreate the great glory days from the Edmonton Orlers, you know, it would be like saying, hey, the Lisa really got a bad, the problem which they do. Let's bring back Johnny Bauer and Bob Pulfurred and George Armstrong and Ronnie Ellis. And suit all those guys up. And we live the great, uh, punch him like days. You know, it's gone. They're going to take it or bring it back. They try to do the same thing in the world cup with team candidates. Look what happened. No, he's at the most of the guys. I don't know. I mean, we had such a younger team than they did. I mean, we deserved to win that. I mean, the world cup. I thought that was a great game. Yeah. But thanks anyway. Okay, pal. What do you say? We have an open line in Broward at, uh, I don't know what he just said. 9 5 4 7 6 7 W. Y O D 7 6 7 9 4 6 3. Fat riches here with my pop at O Park Crap. Which I will not be there tonight. No, no, we got hours and hours of work. I'm going to be in here working feverishly and frantically. We got all this stuff. We got to load into these things into our audio vault and our mini discs and all our other, uh, contraptions that we got here like these, which are fantastic. These, uh, it's just amazing. This is space eight. So we'll have to put a hold on the track. You go out there. Win two, three million. And the next week, I'll be out there on Monday. But there's good news tonight is HB used to say. Do you watch the game last night? Pretty intense. Very intense. It was great being there and it was, uh, a hell of a night. Anyway, let's, uh, do something. Hope that the runner. Here's a lady in Broward. Hello. The last number. The number you call this is, but should it become available? Is that incredible or what? Some miserable bitch in Broward has got the phone. And off the hook, probably you're a pacemaker just crapped out. Maybe he, uh, her, her class to be bag overflowed. It could be it. Unfreaking believable. Open line in the, uh, no, we don't. We're like smoking now. Let's just plot right along. Here's, uh, whatever that is. Here's line five. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. Listen, man. I work at the, uh, the chef that floors the terrain restaurant. Here, here we go, George. There you go. A doubting Thomas. We got in there. Yes. Right down the street. You want some good at the time food. I go in there. Usually about one to a clock. Right. But we deliver from 1130 to 230 right down the street. That would be sensational. We'll call you tomorrow around noon time. And then we can get it over here at two. I'm going to go right now. You want it. Hang on a second. George, we'll give you all the info. All right. Appreciate it. Hang on. Line five. Take care of our piezon over there. Will you see? I told you, uh, gee, you're not going to get nothing over here. Just relax. Okay. Give this slob sitting here in this chair meeting me. Give me 24 hours. I'll get you food right up the old. All right. Up the old. Correct. I'll give you a little short today. Okay. Anyway, it's 127 things are starting to fit right into place. We feel now like we've been here for a long time. Comfortable sit back in the chair. We're climb relax. Take it easy. Kick your shoes off. Unless the Roy sees it. One moment please. Oops. I'm walking in the street. I'm going to get you. Okay. It's okay. It's okay. I'm not this kid. Okay. I'm not this kid. Cracking under the pressure I could feel in here. I'm just smelling it. Put on my five own ones and I hurt his full street. I pooped my pants. Just to doubt the best of hustler and I'm starting to feel heat. A sun-lucky people. Check it out my buttons last season. Yeah, I got a first class riser. It done pitch to ten my jeans. Now I'm sporting the world. I'm finding it impossible to see him. I'm sporting the world. I feel like an absolute out of real. It's all the ghost of this. He was sporting one too. I'll lose him up to the gates of grace for him. Just to see why he would do. It's ghost that face was feeling. As he headed for his room. There's a prison of ghosts. She's waiting for his post. Down in the jungle room. Resported mortars of Memphis. It's still impossible to see his body. But it's a mouth-fetching. I feel like a match-room. Without a wheel. Resported mortars of Memphis. Yeah, he got it. It's almost impossible to see his body. But it's important to see his body. He's not gonna stop. Oh my God. Well, 33 of WI did. We're getting the hang of it now. Maybe we got everything down. We got the food all set up for tomorrow. We got we're ready. We're into a night. We've been just thinking it for the last few hours. Because you have noticed.

Toll free on that green line. Not too much on the green line. Today is usual. 1 888-8949Wiod and a 888 is the new. Because I guess they ran out of 800 numbers or something like that. So that's our new toll free deal is 888. Which I don't like saying to be honest with you. As in, we just got through well, we 888. And speaking of that, another thing that I just found the other night that you won't even believe when you start hearing this, you won't believe it. If you like people, Hey there, Hear the air safe.

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Okay, 136 in WOD. The other masterpiece from Mitch Lewis. And you know who that was that was on a thing with him, by the way? Brian McGarry. Exactly. I wonder where he's hanging out. I wonder where they got him put away, huh? He's all right. He met well. Except when he took away the TV set. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah. Hey, how about Jimmy? Are I getting rid of a Keith Badass and a Jean-Sloat? I love it. I love a guy that means business. He said, I'm here to win. Are all you losers get on the bus and leave it to us? Yeah, yeah. I'm on their flipping through the FM channels today. Yeah. And I hear I come across some guy. You're flipping it, huh? It's 99. Jam. It's an FM station. He'd be jam-in-it. And then the guy there's ripping Jimmy on saying how he got rid of Akins. Because there wasn't Akins thought, you know, and I didn't know Jimmy was on the Akins. But he said, it likes to me like he could use it. You know what I'm saying? He did use him. He was saying that Jimmy's a good, I mean, that James, a good personal friend of his and that he saw. And he feels bad that Jimmy let him go. That he was a good Saint. He stopped that joy out, okay? He couldn't have played on a girl's team. Exactly. There's no space for him. There's no place safe to go. He can't do nothing on specialty. Exactly. I mean, and Keith, well, you know, that's like when I try to make Keith buyers into a ride receiver. It's like trying to make a chicken sandwich into a solo and steak. You know, it just don't happen. Yeah, it doesn't work. Can I get a chance to request? Oh, oh, I think we're going to have to fry this guy. What is it? O.J. O. So when you got about O.J. And which one? I don't know. It's all with the Beatles, O.B. Oh, first thing tomorrow. All right.

That's what I've always said. That's my policy and philosophy. Just wait till Rick Riley sits down in here. Boy, that's really going to be special. We have an open line in date. 622WIOD622WI. Oh, D. And one on the green line. We don't want to. I'm going to suggest they take the green lines up, you know, until Ryan and Ron get here. It's kind of it's heartbreaking. It's aggravating. It just tears your kishki's out. Here's a call from Homestead. Hello. I inhale. Yes, sir. All right. Hey, listen up. Eric Goldie last night played out his ass. Glenn Healey was phenomenal last night as much as we're pissed off about it. Because we had about 85 breakaways. We should have had a lot of goals. He played fantastic. And we give credit where credit is due. Glenn Healey was god last night. I don't like the right jersey. But I have to admire what he did. And he's the backup as they're primary and better than them. Right, though. Yeah, he's the backup. Wow. Anyways, Vegas. But let me say this. He would be the starter on a lot of other teams. Glenn Healey's, he's been around. He's been going. Yeah. He's a guy who was incredible. Just got back in Vegas. Everything I'm saying about it is true. But there is a blue hair out there that's pretty much a little like a kindergarten. Really? Oh, my goodness. And kids. My little kid. Crumb's mattress. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's because they got all the, uh, they got all the amusement park. Well, they got to get everybody out there now. And they want everyone. And they're getting them. Yeah, you want Disney World got a Disney World leave your kids at home. Yeah. Right. Or put a stick in the nursery at DMGM grand. Even got a nursery. Oh, my God. Is it was. Or I got a better idea. Stick him in the desert. Don't give him a map. That would be good. Anyways, the Santa, ever licensed play on a cat. A car that says fat rat. Yes, he most certainly does. He bought Randy off the road the other night. That's that bridge. Like a maniac. You got him. That's the guy. That's Richie. Oh, okay. Okay, pal. Okay, pal. Bye. Good luck to you. That's the fat man. You better get out of his way when he starts motor or long. Trust me when I tell you that one. He is in a big hurry, especially if he's on a way that big, uh, circular thing up there called the track. We have an open line on the purple line, pound IOD. So we got, we get every, based on a rumors and reports out there is everything now straightened out. I mean, I always like being the guinea pig. I like the one to be coming in inaugurating the new stuff. And the thing we did over in Tampa for a week, it's always coming in and making me announcement on here. The station's been sold. I'm always the guy that they had the all good crap to. So is everything okay now? Everything out of control. Everything A.O.K. That listening to a word that I'm saying. Okay, I got the inner com for the back door over here, okay. On what? In the room here. Yeah. And I'm talking to somebody. Who's it to back doors? I have no idea. But I'm sure I should talk to them. Is it food? Haa! Don't panic, Ma. Here, here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Head back to you. Let me tell you something about a year and a half ago. I'm out taking a walk and I got you on the walk, man. Yeah. And back then you were talking about A. We're going to move to Broward in this and that. Oh, that was a Cox people were threatening to move us to Broward right. And look what happens there. You are on your brand new studio. That's right. We couldn't wait for them. So we had to call on Buddy Budice. Get us out of here and move us to a real place. Hey, tell you what since the Harold talk, he section sucks in their NF and their NHL preview thing was pretty horrible. Yeah. Well, you know about this new guest in the Black Cox Moro. We haven't seen him. Yeah. Yeah, I say he did score a nice goal. I saw the replay and at the first game, Black Cox for some reason, they're hot, even without Jeremy Redneck. Yeah, well, they signed out him creating some. Yeah, that's not going to put him over the top. But they're off to a good start. Yeah. Could be a little help at the center though. But he scored a nice goal. And at what the hell? I think they're second game. Five to two over the hell they beat up on. Oh, they beat the blues? Well, they beat the capitals first game. But the second game. That was the second game. They beat the snot out of somebody. They're off to a damn good start. Yes, it was a blues. Yeah. You know, in closing? Yes, sir. I don't know if you have it up in the machine, but since the Holy Father is in the hospital, do you have the Pope's most dope thing? Do we have the Pope? George. First thing tomorrow, like I said, do we have the Pope? Have a great day, pal. We're going to let you go. Great to hear on the new stage. Thanks a lot. See? What is it? Are we going to electrocute these people? They're being very inconsiderate. He said if he's being nice about it, he wasn't pushy. He didn't say play it now or your mom. Did you understand? Did you understand? Huh? Or maybe he asked for your mama. What is it? Did he offer to bring you something? He said he might show up, okay? And he also smelled over the phone. I could tell he smelled like at least partially circumcised. George. I saw there. Smarty pants. So who was it to back door? Anybody we know or want the food? Huh? Just some degenerate. Accumaturate. Okay, just your ordinary pedestrian expert or where she used to that. We got a lot of good training on that. So that don't bother us. 143 at WIOD. Welcome to entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. We're number one, dammit. Oh. Oh. When this quote aback it's lonely. He likes receivers that are wise. Some people say that number ages gain. They say troil loves the big bride. Eight men. He goes down on his knees and he's men. Right, Tom? It's guys he likes to please a man. He loves to slap cowboys on their behind. He's got a spotless reputation. America's team is world renowned. But it's trolling. I've heard some people say. In the heart of he goes down. Eight men. He goes down on his knees and he's men. I can't suppose to squeeze a man. Don't live him cause he likes it from behind. Okay, 148 at WIOD. Let me ask you this question. By the way, this is something I should have talked about back at the beginning. But I'm personally so overwhelmed by the fact that everybody here is so helpful and cooperative and nice to watch at least on the first day anyway. And just the packs and people are the good people. The fat people are the dead people and the packs and people are the good people. And the cocks people mostly suck. But anyway, so leaving the building yesterday. Now, I don't know about you. But when I walked out of there to a clock, I anticipated that perhaps it's we were pretty sure that we were not going to be coming back. That there might be one or two people waiting to say goodbye. Do you know what I'm saying? They're worth. They were sorry they missed you. Like I would have gone up and said, good, about a maple in person. But I can do that when I go to the doctor. I can go and say good bye to maple without going through those doors. You know what I'm saying? And I didn't really want to go up in that part of the building myself. You follow what I'm saying? Because I have a feeling that people are waiting to see if I would venture myself up there. Which why should I do that? And be insincere. Now who were these people that you're speaking of? Who are the longest such as? Such as maple. Well, I said nice things if I love maple. Also good by the maple. Traffic and continuity department. Yeah. Sharon and Stephanie in a net. Right. Yeah. And a host of others that I'm sure I'll get in trouble for forgetting. But what about liking that other place up there for the front? Kind of like close to where maple sits? Hot 105. No, close. Get in warmer now. So thanks to, I see you're such a piece of craft, George. You didn't think I'd come through for you. I'm not even eaten here today. I'm going to my mother's for lunch because it's Wednesday and she's right up to street. And I want to thank Vitos. You're just, you know, I come in here. I'm old. I'm seen all. I'm like fumbling around. Like, and I'm still managed to get through this like a champion. I got stuff here. I don't even know what that all it's all about. And I'm doing just fine. In fact, I'm doing better than some others. I don't want to rub it in. Yeah. Exactly. And he's, well, you're not going to get no food near for us. Yeah. Well, here's Vitos at 3373 Sheridan Street in Hollywood. Vitos, Subshop and pizza delivery smells great too. It smells great. What do they bring you? Mr. Smarty Street. Pizza and a bag of subs. Well, how do you like that? How do you like that? Something to tidy over until we have a real big feast in here tomorrow at two. And what we're going to be doing to keep everybody happy, including Roy, who's been very nice to us. We don't want to get him bed out of shape, but I don't think we would take too much. We don't want to press him too far, so to speak. Exactly. But we'll have him bring stuff in around a little before two. And we'll have our little thing out there. It'll be a beautiful thing. It'll be great. Okay. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Miami Beach. Neil. Yes, sir. That's the luck when you know endeavor. Thank you so much. Kelly Cole and the Kangita Gambleers. Thank you.

Can I get you on a safety radio up north like? Safety radio on a police band or something? Yeah. Yeah, I know. I'll be on a police band. Yeah. No, I mean the damn radio's they got. My kids got one. Sure, wave. Yeah. Can I get you one at no? No. How come? But how come? Can California on a radio. Do your kids have a computer? No. My kids have a computer. He's got a radio. It's California. It's Chicago. It's Detroit. Yeah. It's a hell out of me. Who do you want to explore? Well, I want to hear you. I know. Where are you going? You're going to New York. I told him one of the landics city. I'm a gambler. I'll get out of here. It's that guy again. Why did you put him on a air? Oh no. Here's a Hollywood. Hollywood. Hollywood. Going once. Going twice. Here's a pop at a. Hello. Pop at a. You know something there's got to be something wrong with this phone. Okay. There must be assholes. Hello. Hello. Speak to me. See this guy can't hear me. That's his problem. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm sorry. Welcome to Hollywood. Hello, wait a minute. That's my old fault. Why is that? I had the phone laying down. Is there is the level where you'll low on a phone when you're holding? Yeah. Yeah. That's not like I'm a liar. So no, George is giving me like a sign like your number one. Let me just say that. Okay. He sounds a little snooty today. He's snooty in there because he's having technical problems and he'll fossil in here. I'm holding my own pretty good, but I got a lot of experience. I'm holding it, sir. Yeah. Welcome to Hollywood. Anyway, I knew you'd get some calls on the food so I didn't even bother. Right. Sounds like we're back to the wonderful old days of radio for you. Right. It sounds great. It's going to be dynamite. We'll get the carts all rolling. We're all sit back and listen and something like that. And now, you know, something now the real work starts because this is a massive project. We've had no leadership whatsoever. I don't want to mention from programming. But it's kind of been like a do it yourself project. And now that we're finally in here, now it's going to be like day after day and night after night. We got, you know, we got 8 million bits of stuff that we got a stick in here now. Well, stick it in. So that's the point. Now we're coming to the fun part. Now we're going to stick it in. Thanks a lot, pal. Including. Yes. I love it. See ya. He's crumbling at the seams. It sounded like to me. Unbelievable. Oh my God. Right. Here's a bell harbor. Hello. Yes, sir. Hi, Neil. How are you doing? You can barely hear you when you're on, on hold. I know that's part of the problem is that we'll get that cranked up. Make a note on at George level on hold. It's not a major deal. I can do it. Yes, sir. Remember when you come on, Rick and said show an hour early.
