This kid didn't, and I read in the paper this morning, and it sounds like the same old stuff again. I don't get it. I mean, I won a game 24-17, but I'm reading it. I'm looking at the stands here. 62 yards, net rushing. And the articles are going on in glowing terms about how great are being spiced, looked. And the running game finally got going. great to sixty two yards that rushing one of the Vikings have the Vikings had like uh... what two hundred eighty five the Vikings had ninety six yard ninety eight almost a hundred in the slopp and then there's another thing in here about jb brown a given a chance again jb brown burned once again given up a thirty one yard touchdown past burned badly and again the dolphin should have one easily reason i did that the beginning is because i got to be honest with you we got the exhibition game coming up canada in the west world cup hockey tomorrow night on uh... every prime network everywhere in the world seven thirty and then they're going to show it again a ten thirty and some of the other stations why i you know i hate to say this and i'm going to the dolphin regular season games this year we got the tickets me in the fat man on the fifty yard line but i just don't know i just don't know if i can get and maybe i'm you know one of a very small select hockey fanatics all over the hockey fan for many many years but after the excitement we had this past spring and almost into the summer time and the start uh... with a football again i'd maybe just not ready for it maybe because it's ninety eight degrees in the shade out there i'm not ready for it but we'll find out we'll find out about all the big dolphin fans out there there's psyched what did they have did they have fifty thousand last night did they have fifty another thing that it may as you look in your look in your look in the abox score here in the estates and it's gotten ordinarily where you would find the attendance in our in our games it's never in here maybe it's someplace else where they're hiding it what was the attendance last night anybody know fifty five fifty one people fifty one thousand is it anywhere in here we'll find out like i said maybe we'll find out maybe we won't eleven after ten a w i o d a six six seven eight would be eating if i didn't do anything as far as any further than this tying up the clamp to think about that passion for say d until midnight on news talking entertainment radio sixteen w i o d ten fourteen a w i o d and i can see a tremendous we had fifty five thousand nine thirty eight which is pretty dang good for an exhibition this game in our last night in crappy weather almost fifty six thousand and they got sixty thousand season ticket sold thanks to JJ of course and thanks to the fact that she will have a finally got the brains demo and looks like they're going to do about sixty one thousand season tickets they said but you think maybe the expectations are a little bit like unrealistic perhaps because i'm looking at the article here and reading everything i can about this game and it sounds to me like again like a pass rush no real running game korea Abdul Jabar what do you do eleven the carries twenty six yards pretty weak pretty stinkin weak and a suspect secondary signs like the same old stuff so if everybody's patient everybody says okay we got a year maybe two years we're going to give this guy a chance but no one is town or we're going to do that here's the purple line hello yes sir hey and how are you doing okay were you there well as a matter of fact i think if i couldn't make it okay but i heard from a friend of mine the any idea of any kind of run game last night because of the uh... condition of that field was just forget it yeah uh... weeks before they still got the mountain all the baseball crapped there was a quagmar i guess it was it was terrible the way i hear it and i was listening to it on your coverage and it was excellent coverage the bottom line was just forget it it's just not going to happen until they get over that baseball thing which my opinion is a waste of time it's just not going to happen yeah that's about it thanks have a great day thanks for the memories bye bye okay seven five one nine four six three so the field was a quagmar again which takes us back a couple years to that first game when the marriage was doing the game and somebody walked into the booth and said hey jack asking your f-in fact straight before you go on here anybody remember that i can't remember what his name was but uh... i would do remember that ball spot seven five one nine four six three and date five two four wouddeen proud one eight hundred nine four four nine four six three on the green lines here's uh... my name is hello uh... yes sir hey i want you to get last night and and uh... i was impressed with the the my immediate lines i think you know and a few weeks you know maybe uh... months ago to the season they're going to be the strongest point of the team yeah they need more help on the offensive line opening holes for the running backs and then late in the game the cream outdozer bar rookie he seemed to uh... at least start you know uh... getting in there and getting some work and so he may come along he may come along over all i was coming in at yet i was an i was impressed with the toughness of the team also uh... and can i make one little side board did uh... now let's see did this kid uh... what does the name of who who who were did the kicking off in the field was last night well still missed one hit the up bar nice and then the other guy see a story of yet well you know so the other guy that's challenging he was put to have a stronger leg and he was doing kick off yeah and he didn't get any into the answer they're all down to the ten and five that's his big claim to families that that he's got a stronger leg and a kick off so that's why stores on a block yeah but he didn't uh... kick him deep last night yeah although he did make a field all that the incumbent i mean the uh... challenge yeah who's name is whose name is well i'm looking i haven't got any idea what his name is somebody well it's he's doing it's on the service got uh... no field rules last night he missed one hit the up bar and i was in yeah and the one okay yeah by the time i would find the adult and field rule here would be like the end of the show already also one little side by a netty that's a kid's name and he yeah one little side bar yeah uh... to me don't you think uh... colon pal at the republican convention acted like the biggest of hotel on the court on the come down to pay a meaning why he was giving a democratic speech at a republican convention all he did was uh... not those boots so how does that make him an uncle time he was out of place why was he out of place in other words he he fancies himself for republishing first of all i didn't want to total of twenty minutes of the whole convention number one number two i saw about two or three minutes of his speech which everybody's saying oh gee that was the great speed to the convention to me he seemed like a very wooden speaker not quite in the category al-gore but he seemed like a really poor speaker and i didn't uh... he didn't do anything to turn my lamp on i'll tell you that or he seems to sit in with the uh... clearance promises and it seems to me any minority that joints the republican from that standpoint it's like the log cabin facts it's the same thing i mean you're about to have a facts with the death wish i agree with you i don't understand it's like it's like to choose for jesus thing you know i don't it makes no sense to me yeah anyway but always a pleasure try to figure a moment have a great day okay we have an open line of day seven five one one a brown five two four one on the green line forty seven on a short truce lines

from last season and a Stanley cup and all this other good stuff and somebody called and said Gary betman was on talking about the fact that the NHL this year has the rights to all the video and so they're the only ones who are allowed to put stuff out but I find that very very hard to believe because they know the leaves put a video out of a year why the hell uh... wouldn't the panthers have a night to this great year i think it would be a big cellard out here right they be so like halivana beach are you some kind of collectors and right they be saw like drugs and sop beach that if i see

sidelines and uh... you know makes a few in-and comments for the presses if he really has something in-volve with the team which we know he doesn't and then he goes up in a press box and they're looking in from head to toe and uh... that's you i guess again it was something to do uh... it's a bit of a summer it's a boring uh... two monday or whatever and uh... he's there the sports must be

Even though we have a 75-minute break coming up, I want to tell you one thing. Because I know that there are some newsletters being put out being disseminated as of this week by some people who lie a lot, which is their brand of religion. I don't want to mention the AFA. And if anybody really believes that there is a death of spots on this show, or that any major changes are going to take place of any significance. They're in a dreamland. We got spots by advertisers who haven't even gone into business yet. So not that the Cox people are squeezing every last piece of blood out of the tournament. He's last few weeks here, but trust me when I tell you, you'll see when we come back in about 20 minutes. 1135 at WIOD. Yeah, the horn has them just riding down on 95. Hey Bob, nice ass. Looking good, can I touch it today? No, that's sexual harassment, and I'm not going to take it from you. So I guess that means I can't touch your ass, right Bob? No, you can't. Let me have to come on. Get away, don't get out there. Stop patting me. Remember, touching somebody's ass is sexual harassment. And sexual harassment is a crime. Don't touch somebody's ass. This message brought you by your local derriking razor place. Try our milkshake. Okay, 21 before noon at WIOD. We have an open line, 100 green line, 1 894-4, 9463. Here's Miami on a purple line, hello. Nio. Yes, uh. Just got back from New York for the world's largest macarena. Yeah. Oh, my God. I mean, they just came out of the woodwork. Yeah. 39,000 people. 30,000 Puerto Rican, yeah. Oh, my God. I mean, it was like being back in Miami again. And probably a few Cubans, uh, floating over from Jersey too. Oh, no, they had a rafting. They had the starting line up to Spanish. They rafed it across from Union City, yeah. Oh, my God. I was just unbelievable. It was panic. Oh, I mean, uh, where did this start? Where did this come from? I don't know where it's like a plague. It's like it's like the wave. Where the hell did the wave start? Who started that crap? What kind of moron start? You know, I remember as a kid go to ball games. I never say they do in the wave. They weren't doing a hokey pokey. They weren't doing a macarina. And guess what? We were having a good time because the quality of the game was really great and it was exciting. And we had a good time. And even the hot dogs were better. I mean, I'm the world's largest Yankee fan, but I was thoroughly embarrassed. Yeah. By that whole macaroni thing. And I don't know what to do it. I don't want to know how to do it. And never will learn how to do it. I can't wait till it gets to Chicago and Harry starts doing it. Instead of the singing take me out of the ball game. Oh, please. Can't you see that? Yeah. Oh, please. Can't suck around for that. Crochety. In fact, I can't wait till Steve Stone starts doing it. He might actually fly right out of the booth. Which one do you want the crow? The crow. You said did you see the crow? And it's not out yet. Do you want to have the first album? The first day. It's the second movie in the string. No, no. The first album. What do you mean it's the second movie? This day. The first one was with Brandon Lee. The one he died on. But this says the crow. It doesn't say the sequel. It doesn't say something. See the Avengers. See the Avengers. Yeah. That's the second one. Oh, excuse me. Okay, hang on. Thanks. You got the bird. Hang on. Okay. Send him a crow like in a box on a purple liner. The crow. Jesus. God. You. It's like a full-time occupation just to keep up with all the Inanity man. We're just surrounded by it. It's the city of angels. It's the crow too. As the crow flies. Or did that expression never come from by the way? And when the swallows do what? When they swallow what? In Capustrano? And from what I've heard they do? Here's Carl Springs. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes? I'm kind of the van. Beesburg update? Yes. Van Beesburg isn't playing. That's what I thought. And Gea Bear is playing in place with him. Gea Bear from the mighty ducks. Yep. Oh, brother. He's kind of American to me, huh? He's all right. Yeah. Oh, a frog. Gea Bear. That's a good point. He was born in this country of frog. Oh, my God. A step on him. He might be a boofo. Can anyone up sounds pretty good? Yeah, I never went through that yet. I better whip that out. A greck ski, love you? Yeah. Windross? That's the edge? The memory is not planned. The memory is not planned. No. Oh. Was everybody thinks that's a good sign? Because it means he'll probably play in a regular season? Yeah, well. Sack it and for me. I got it. I got it here somewhere. Or I had it. I lost it. I'll find it. I've never great day. What? Too late. So anyway, what did I do with the stuff that I threw it out? Did I throw it out? Talk about this organized. We got a mess in this joint man, Alexa, which you wouldn't believe. And of course, you probably don't care, but that's a heritist. I got it. It's an emistivalist, down lowness stuff from the Cox lawyers again about that lawsuit with the you know who and all other crap. It's not bad enough that you waste a whole afternoon giving your deposition. But then you got to read it and you got to sign it and you got, yeah, I already gave it. Okay, I said it and I'm blowing out your ass. Okay, where's the Canadian roster? Because I'm sure it'll sound. It'll be a little bit easier to understand if I'm reading it as opposed to him on a phone with all due respect. Rod Brindamore, Theo Florey, Ron Francis Wayne, Grezki Polkorey is not planned. A club of new, Mary O's not planned. Trevor Lind and Eric Lindros, Mark Messier, Keith Primo, Joe Sackick, Brandon Chanhand, Padver Big, Stevie Eisenman, all right. Rod Blake, Doug Bajur, Ray Bork, Paul Coffee, Eric, They jar'd Dan Scott Needemire, Lyle O'Deline, Alma Kinnis, Scott Stevens, Martin Broddour, Curtis Joseph and Bill Ranford. And that's Canadian. They're playing the US and the exhibition tomorrow night. 730, it'll be on the first time and I don't know where. Too bad somebody can't really inform us, but hey, we keep asking for information. And nobody wants to tell us out there is it on the sports channel. Where is it on at 730? And of course when you have two dishes, you don't have to be really too worried that you're going to miss it. It'll be on there. And then again, a 1030 late at night, it's on all the prime things which I think include sunshine. Here is Miramar on the purple line. Hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Great. Good morning. I wanted to ask you something about the Jimmy Johnson guy. Why is it pushing to get out there as a bed? It's starting. Oh, great. It's starting. Great. What's the monsoon season? Thanks, God. Because we got that guy that killed that guy with his car watching the hurricane out there. Yeah. I want to talk to you. Do you notice how the other day they found first they found the head without a body? Yeah. And then they found the body without a head. What a perfect man. It was kind of like a mix in match. Yeah, it was great. I wanted to complain about Jimmy Johnson and I did that. Please. Well, you've heard of the American Lung Association, right? Yeah. Every year we do a halftime show for the Miami Dolphins in the American Lung Association. I'm one of the volunteers. Do you remember when we go out there about 300 of us with the steps? And we do like the grab ass team? With the one? The steps. The step of rubbish. We do a big deal out there for about five minutes. I never paid any attention that stuff with all the respect. Okay. That's fair. The last four years we've been doing this and we raised probably about $100,000 a year for the American Lung Association, which is not a shuddy charity. Yeah. It's the real deal. Yeah. Well, from one owner's name. The American Cancer Society. Yeah. Well, from one owner's name. Well, we do a, the American Lung has a lot of stuff. They, uh, I don't need to get into it. It's, it's a great organization. And give me a cigar George. There you go. Well, you just inspired me. Okay. While when you're in that way. When you're in that way. When you're in that way. When you're in that way. When you got problems at home and you can't breathe, the American Lung generally comes your house and takes care of. Yeah. Yeah. Well, for a sweet because we raised money to help keep them going. Okay. So getting back to Jimmy Johnson's while you're doing this 500 Chamberlain's plug for the American Lung Association, yes? So we're supposed to go out there every year and raise money. So I understand that Johnson has stuck his nose into it and says he wants to. He stuck his, he stuck his Johnson into it. He stuck his Jack into it. Johnson, yeah. And he says that he's, uh, a sound there this year. Why not? Same way that he deeps six to dolphin, breakfast that they used to do every year for a few months. Yeah. Yeah. I have no idea. What's the head coach doing with the App Times show? Yeah. What sense is that make? Well, he's a hands-on guy. That's what Treyachman says. That, oh, he ought to know. He's a real hands-on guy. He gets involved in everything. He ought to know. As in maybe a little bit over involved. I wonder if he's going to pass in the soap. It's not. That's what that's what the brain's them says. He says that the two of them are pretty tight. That's the rumor that somebody just started a little while ago. The punch line on the whole thing is the American line counter from what I understand. The American line countered by saying, okay, well, we don't make money. We make money for people that need it. You know, they're helping in the community. Yeah. So Johnson says, well, I want shows that they're going to make money and they said, okay, fine, what we'll do since we generally raise close to 100 grand a year. We'll give you half. Right. What's the association that you want us to contribute to money to it? Right. It comes up with some name. They investigated. It doesn't exist. Johnson's a phony. It's a big money. You want me to believe that? Yeah, expect you to believe it. Based on what? Based on the fact that you said it? What? Johnson's a phony? So where was the money going? Trying to say that he was going to pocket the 50 grand? I'm not trying to say anything. What I'm trying to say is that they asked him if they wouldn't mind splitting it with the dolphins and said they would take a general account. Maybe it was a, maybe it was his way of saying blow it out your ass. Might have been, but that's not really a nice thing to do it for a lot of people in the community. I understand. But he's not necessarily always a nice guy. Well, this is true, but the main crux of it is what is he doing? I don't know what the half time shows. Yeah, that's a good point. It's a real good point. Maybe I can let's bring back the karaoke guys. Okay. See you. Well, let's check it out. All right. Can I hang out for a CD? No. We have an open line on a purple line. I'm not giving that guy no CD. He's ripping our coach. I mean, a guy for crying out loud isn't even have his thing wet yet in the shower with the dolphins and already their ripping of an ass. Give this guy a chance. Tell me Johnson's fucks and sodas is heck up. What do you do? Try and rape a weed wacko. Oh. 1148 at WIOD. News talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. For Christ's sake, I only had one. Oh, 1152 at WIOD. And one of the 85 engineers from Paxon was just over here during the first hour. So sitting in with George, they are so accommodating these people that it's frightening. Frightening. We're not used to this. We're not being used to being pampered. It's like when we try to get these car machines here in the beginning. And Boy Gary says, oh, no chance. You'll never live long enough to get those in there. I'll believe it when I see it. Remember that deal? But all of a sudden, we're dealing with people saying, what do you want? How do you want it? Do you want it medium rare or soft? The hard? However, you want it. We're going to give it to you as opposed to here, what it gives it to you in your Breckham and walk away with a smile on their posts. So we're pretty excited about it. We're going to have like state of the art parts and we're going to have all kinds of all this mess. I'm surrounded by a pile of crap here. I got stuff in a box, stuff in a bag, stuff in a sack. But we do have a 35 seconds left in the DCS, by the way. Here's Miami. Hello. Is the Tom behind the club? I beg your pardon. This is Wiod Radio. You're on the air soon. Oh, right. Yeah, I'm on this to pick it. Can I come in please? Is this your ID of humor? Is this your ID of humor? Puts? Schmeckle? Sensing here the radio. Since you can hear the radio in the back. What is it? Are you okay? We have an open line of day, 7519-463-751 Schmeckle, which means a real small one. Tiny. Minus guill. Here's my, me, hello. What the hell was that? You're acting, you're acting mean. You can hear the best part of it is you hear the radio in the back. All I heard was, right. Neil, you can go already stole my firebed. The bees are not going to be playing there in the world, huh? Right. I don't know exactly what channel it's going to be on. I don't have the dish. Well, I'm trying to find a dish and have it reserved. I am assuming. I am assuming. Well, first of all, it's tomorrow. So why would they have it today? I mean, tomorrow's using. Yeah. So I'm assuming that it'll be in the paper tomorrow. But I also would assume it to be on. Now, let's see. Are the mallings playing of our, do we know? Er, he's. What? I don't know. You're hoping not, right? I hope not. Well, sure they're going to be playing somewhere tomorrow. They got a home. They can't have a home game. They play today. I mean, yesterday. Well, that's right. They're in that right hole that they're in Chicago, okay? Right. So the good news is the likelihood it's a 220 game because it's, uh, I'm all those positive it'll be a day. Although tomorrow's Wednesday, which is ESPN baseball. So they may, I don't know. Right. And Friday, they got that double header down here. Yeah. Little header what? Baseball or something. Baseball or something. Uh-huh. And also I did find out from PC. I they said that they wanted to read that they will hopefully have, uh, sports channel by the beginning of not this fucking season but next. So what is that? So what is that going to do here? Well, they said the main reason why I said, uh, the, their logic is that, um, said, uh, since Wayne owned that channel, the, the morons will, eventually go over and they want to have it for a, on their system by the time the morons go over. Yeah, but in other words, if you want to see the Panthers screw off as what they're saying, it's not nice. Yeah. Well, screw them. And also I got something really good. A new song that, with that, just came out. It's about the OJ Simpson trial and basically help people are losing contact, uh, you know, I become a, you know, or living the lives of what they see on television. Yeah. It's called, it's the new rush song, uh, uh, tune to echo. Yeah. It's, it's pretty good. Um, it's about time someone, some other people started screaming about, you know, people, you know, not having contact with anything. Okay. Okay. Okay. Go have some contact. Okay. Good idea. Open line in dates. What was she saying? Open line in dates. 7, 5, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 4.

I was in a really good team. I was in a really good team. I've been listening to radio here. Have you been feeling back to back as the best ever? I mean, I've been having a week. I've been listening to it for a while. I'm enjoying it. I'm savoring it. Great. How about a crow? What do you want on it? Must have a crow. Okay. Hang on. Put some salsa and lemon morangu on the guy's crow. We got two more of those. We got Brian Adams. We got this. We got Kanchi. We got kind of a del morangue. Kind of held the last. Oh, host. Deano's. We got the shang. We're lasing it. Carnival de la salsa. Put your salsa on your morangu. We're showing your right way. But we can't find a pulse. W-I-O-D. Miami Ford Latterdale. New's talking in our team. Radio 6-2. W-I-O-D. And then he is a dog. A-O. Her breath smells like bile. She's got crust in her eyes. She smells like a urinal that attracts lots of flies. When she sits on the porch, she picks a scavenger knee. Third teeth of brown. When she smiles, she's a trailer-trash woman. For me. She has lice up above. She's got grabs down beneath. I called it trailer and w-O-D-Family. Her father's her brother. Her uncle's her grabbed knee. But I don't care. She's the trailer-trash woman for me. Oh. She never bays herself. She looks like a sloth. Her nose is running so slimy. Oh. Her hair ain't gunna hangs on. Unbelievable. She has 12 cheeks. She has 12 eyes. Recto. She wipes her mouth under shirt when she's eaten. She stinks at the time of the month that she's bleeding. She has a hair-trash stand, Lou from taxi. Thank you, baby. I can't put this love on the shelf. She's the trailer-trash woman for me. Girl. You know, I mean, it's from the bottom of my heart. No one is as special as you to me. That's why you are my trailer-trash woman in deep. Oh, she's now the other bit that's got the good hom job on the end of it. I'm like this one. 12-O-7 at W-I-D. What's the other one called? Almost a woman to me. Almost a wood-like, very good. Very good. In fact, I might be inspired to play a couple of bars with that just to roof. And it doesn't sound like we're a lot of kids. So I like to begin with this one. And of course, you know, we could try to play them at the same time. Oh, I like that. That's one of my all-time favorite, one moment please. She's got really big, big, big. Her presence smells like crazy. She's got crust in her. Yeah. She's really too nice. My voice is like, there ain't even a tray. She lots of fly. And you wouldn't know. When she said sounds up for it. She thinks he's got a button. He talks like a man by the trees almost the woman. Okay, nice trying. Hey, listen, we'll look at that perfect. It will get it done perfect. If it takes till 2 o'clock. So anyway, we've got trends coming out today. They're going to be really bad. That's my prediction. They're going to be like, just a fraction. We may have a one-share lift by the time we get out of this joint. But the good thing is we got to look forward to all that great new equipment. And be in our own building without a whole bunch of other assholes running around. It's going to be great for lucky year or two. We think. Here's Pembroke Pines. Hello. Yeah, I know. Yes, sir. I heard you about 10 30 quarter to 11. Say something about your waiting for a fact for the differences of the Sony and RCA dishes. Yeah. Yeah, you're talking about yesterday. I went up the brands, Mark. They're pushing the Sony. And apparently they don't have any of the RCA's right now. And I was kind of wondering the difference also. Basically the guy says there is no difference. But I don't know if he knows what he's talking about. Yeah. Well, it sounds like you learned a lot. Well, I'm telling you. I tried to learn a lot, but I didn't learn anything at all. That's what I mean. And well, you're waiting this fact from. I'm still awaiting as of like from noon yesterday when I asked it's only 24 hours later. So the pony must be ill. But somebody out there you think would know the difference between the Sony and the RCA. If they make even make the RCA anymore and the prosk and which is made by RCA. And what the difference is between how many sets you can hook up. And if there's any difference in the picture, anything. Is it that difficult or question? I try to get the same thing from them. Yes, to them basically saying that they're the same. Just a different name on the dish. Yeah. And that's what they have to offer and other than that. If that's true, then I would stick with the Sony because they got one hell of a low price on it. I think now. Right. And that's what I think I'm going to go with. And basically saying that the menu is different on a Sony. It has a quicker menu. And it has a quicker way to channel scan. That's what he was telling. Oh, and I like that. That's a one thing that frustrates me about that RCA dish. Oh, you'll have to have that with make it this way. Oh, boy, that thing just, I mean, you can scan a real fast once you get to the guide. It has a guide that you just hooked up on your remote. Right. And you can scan that fast. But it's just, I don't know. It's just. In other words, you want to go from a game to a game or whatever you're saying that you're just going to take a couple seconds for this and a couple seconds for that. Well, no, because the game is like the baseball packets are all like right next to each other. You know, right. So you just talk around from channel to channel to same with the hockey, similar to the NBA, same with the college football. So I don't know, but he said, just he said something about the menus for the Sony is concerned is obviously going to be quicker. Yeah. And, you know, like I said, well, with that package, I wanted to ask you, you had, he said, you watch a lot of the pens on KBL with Mike Langlast here. Right. And that's what I'm definitely interested in. And I got to get into the 21st century. Yeah. Because this cable stinks. Amen. Well, then I'm going to give him a call. And I'm also right now. Also, by the way, somebody just called to say that the, some of the world cup games are going to be on FX. Now, FX, I hate to break the news to some of the people out there. I don't remember too many cable outfits that have FX on there unless I'm living in the past. Do you have FX on your cable? FX. I don't believe so. Yeah. Which I do have FX on the big dish, at least one of them still in the clear, but it is on a small dish. All right. I'm going to go with that. And the guy I was talking about, Lameu earlier, Mariel, Lameu. I just got back from Pittsburgh at the day. He was talking, had a press conference about not planned in the world cup. In the world cup. Right. I do believe he's going to be back next year. And I'm going to try to put it up, I guess, a little bit on defense. Hopefully we're going to be able to take it all the way. Yeah. And that red is Zubo. They got hatching. I read a Zubo off. And they were not real happy with Zubo's defensive play. Well, when I was up there. And they were not really happy with the fight. Yeah. Yeah. They don't want to pay. And I also heard that, well, there was a couple other things that came out up there. But you know, interestingly enough, a lot of people thought that Regget was on a way because it seems to me, maybe I'm a dream of it, but I thought they just resigned. Can Regget. They did. They just signed them. It's a matter of seconds talking about my father. And like, 35 years season, taking a hold her up there. Right. And they all thought that he was going. So now I don't know what they're going to do with Baraso. I think he's still going to be number one. Apparently they're going to be able to keep him both. Another interesting thing he was telling me, my father and all they doubled the price of his tickets. Yeah. He's up in the balcony. Yeah. So what he did is he moved over one section, moved back, one row. And his tickets, the ticket price was cut in half. Beauty. You got to pay everywhere if you want to see these guys play. The joggers, the lamus and so on and so forth. You got to pay the nut. You got to pay the nut as exactly it. Better believe. Okay, pal. Thanks Neil. Great. There's a guy that's trying to find out some information even he can't find out. He actually got out of the house. They still can't find out what's going on. Open line and Broward 5249463. It's 1213 at WOD. I love this show. I'm up on here. I let my pull it. I can't help it if you don't like it. Wendy Butler's all. Look at that little way before I put it away for you. Damn it. Rick and I have a 610 AM on news, talking entertainment radio. 610 WOD. Where's my meat? What about some new potato chips cause they ain't got any fat. But now we're after I ate them in the jama-sat. I knew they had some side of things but I thought I'd take a chance. But right after I swallowed them, I felt my colon dance. Ain't a list of my bowel vegan disease. Now I'm in the can of squatting with my pants around my knee. Ain't a list of now I'm afraid to sneeze. Cause I might feel something disgusting running down my knees. I'm gonna shoot a scene at morning that they put on the bag. And I should have been suspicious when the clerk gave me a rag. With you, we can don't be surprised if your belly hurts. And in about an hour you'll have the your list of skirts. Ain't a list of my bowel vegan disease. Now I'm in the can of squatting with my pants around my knees. Ain't a list of now I'm afraid to sneeze. Cause I might feel something disgusting running down my knees. So next time you're sitting on a can and have real bad diarrhea, ask yourself if there's a God. Okay, it's 12-18 and W. No, seriously, that's the easiest test. Okay, the easiest limit test if there's this all-powerful God. Couldn't you have created some simpler, more dignified, cleaner, or a more Senate, you don't want to say it? The process of elimination is like another wicked game. Another evil trick that God played on us, right? What a sense of humor, man. Here's the real what? Robon Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, how are you doing? Okay. Listen, the other day you were talking about piercing, well I got a spy report. I have a friend who has a friend in San Francisco. You have a friend that has a friend. Yeah, that does piercing for the stars. Yeah. And he has, yeah, Steve Young and Troy, he can have their helmet, Super Bowl rings, Pierce on their lower helmets. How about that? They had their Super Bowl rings pierced. Under lower, you know, I mean helmets. The lower part of the, if I could say it, you know, Rectum. Rectum. Troy said it to make some feel better, can end up the middle. Yeah. You know, cute. Anyway, can I really call him? No chance. We have an open line on a green line. 1-800-944 with material like that. And he's going to ask for something to get out of here. 1-800-944-Wild-D, where it's 12, and I'm going to ask for something to get out of here. Okay, let's go to Miami, hello. Hola. Hola. Are you doing? Come on, Star. We'll be in moving. Oh, yes. Of course, I come, Star. I saw on my cable, they have the box. I don't know if you heard that. You ordered videos and crap like that. The box. The box for Luis. Yeah. And the box. The box, the box. The box. I know the box. And you know. No, I know which box you're talking about, yeah. I saw the video yesterday for Luis Miguel. See? A different Wild-Dunny. Oh, for the movie. For the hunchback of you. Hunchback of you, M. The hunchback. And he needs to go in the acumen. Yeah, I heard he's busted out all over. Yeah, not that, but, you know. From the nipples down, he's starting to get that middle-aged spread. Jeez. Well, you want to know about the effects channel? Is that where you're talking about? The Fox effects channel? Fx. Fx, yes. Right. Is it on your cable system? Yeah, it's on mine, but I'm in date, though. What cable you got? T.C. Uh, sucks. Oh, yeah. Maybe it is on everybody, is not just never paid any attention to what's in the subject. I sort of like the basic, one of the basic services. Yeah. So, you know. And I'm going to go back a month. I'm sorry about this. I'm apologizing beforehand. You're going to go back. What? About a month. We're talking about the room service at the MGM grant. Right. Fantastic. Oh, it is. Fantastic. They got 5,000 rooms in a hotel, and it's like 20 to 25 minutes at the most. Yep. And the food is spectacular. I've never never in my life anywhere in the world had food in the hotel. It's good as the MGM grant. I had the sticks I went there. Right. It was sensational. Yeah. The best I ever had. And my life had the bowl of the hotelini. See? You're mungous bowl. Yeah. And you're cleaning your finish it. All right. So they give you the big one at the MGM grant. Yeah. The portions are gigantic too. Yep. Yep. Fantastic. Outstanding. Let's go right now. Can I have the cross-city? For you know, it's how fast he's set away because he thought my finger was on it? Yeah. I thought you were going to come in with there. Let's see. If I got another one, did I got another one right here? Yeah. Did you see the crow? Did you see the crow? The original one? Yes, sir. You're the one. What was it about? That's like a cult classic there. Well, the killed him and his girlfriend. And he supposedly came back from the dead to get revenge. Yeah. For the murder. And that's what the whole movie is about. Killing all the guys that killed his woman. So they must still have some more to kill. Yeah. Yeah. I guess she's not finished. Okay. Line 3, given the bird. We have an open line on a purple line, which is a major miracle. Since we started giving free crap away, it seems to have stimulated a whole lot of stuff here, including a lot of people that don't want free crap. How do you like that, Mr. Expert up there in Boiton Beach? How do you like that, maples, huh? I don't know otherwise. Pretty boring Tuesday. We have an open line on. I thought that the dolphin exit. But once we get the real season going, once we get rid of it, and how come they're playing the buck and ears twice in the exhibition season? What is that all about? If we ever done that before, played the same team twice. You only play for exhibition games. Why would you play the same stick in, especially a boring team like that? Twice. Probably because it's real close by over there, and it's not going to be real expensive to send it to the troops over there and we're trying to save money. He must have put the fix in with the NFL. God, and on a Friday night, two-nolosa. It's this Friday, right? This is coming Friday. All right. The Tampa Bay Bucketner is boy to the suck. And also I heard that great American Drew Rosenhaus while they were kissing his ass last night, saying that the work put in any offer for Eric Rett and the dolphins may get Eric Rett. That sounds okay to me because there's a guy that can really run with a football. Not another way these guys are thinks he's a hot shot because his name is the same as some former superstar that was net movie airplane. 1223 a WIOD. Let's talk at entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. Your marriage takes us to after each day. First there was Buns of Steel. Then came abs of Steel. But they forgot about one important muscle. Now get ready for the most complete fitness video. You're a substeeal. That's right. You're a substeeal. We'll buff up your birth canal and head volume to your bolma. So if you want to wash board boom, get you a substeeal. Get it today. So hockey feels keeping a fact machine going and you set up a lot of paper for which we're very grateful by the way. He says, I'm assuming that CBC will show tomorrow's hockey mate. I don't think so. I haven't seen nothing on the schedule or any TV book. It doesn't say nothing nowhere. The exhibition game, if not it might be on Sunshyna, what the Liberty Sports Channel is on the Big Dish, with some of us have. And he says, the CBC schedule for the World Cup. The other matches recovered by Sunshyna and Liberty Sports Channel. And also FX filled by the way FX. And now put his music. So let's see, CBC's got 11 games that on this schedule. And why did they have military time? They don't do military time in Canada. They do it in Europe. They do it in a lot of places, but not like in Canada. Why is it got like 20, 20, 100 to 20, 100 to 2300? 8 o'clock to 11 o'clock. But Thursday 29th, a week from this Thursday. Canada against Russia and Vancouver. I'm pretty sure that's the first game. I've seen nothing about no exhibition game being on it on a CBC on their promos. And Saturday the 31st candidate against the USA in Philadelphia. And Sunday September 1, Canada against Slovakia and Ottawa. So in other words, basically what this boils down to when I know the CBC's making a lot of cutbacks because the government's real cheap and they don't have any money is that they're not doing it in these European games. So they do 11 games, but they're all from Montreal, not a one-filly and Vancouver and the New New York. USA and Russia in New York Monday, September 2. Okay, here's a pop-in-o. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I kind of called her and I bought a dog doing it on the carpet. Are you supposed to rub your nose in it? Yeah, yours. Here's a South Miami. Hello, that's the same asshole. South Miami. Hello. Welcome to the idea. Okay. You have Hurricane football's fire force. They are the new defensive coordinator today. Jaddy Tachrin. Yeah. Nice going. Gotta hear Marraba taking it down. Okay. Thank you. Here it is. Nice one, Marra. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. You want to hear a new, a list of free seats, huh? Do I want to hear what? A new list of free seats, huh? See? Oh, no. Do you got it? Oh, yeah, I'll now. Here it is. Colourine. Arrhythmic. La-ca-da. Don't understand. Arrhythmic. Can I get out of city? For after that. I'll whisk me again. Play it, baby. Do you want to hear that, like it? What do you want? Uh, city. But which one? Getting crows. Crow's gone. He got. How about kiss? That's fine. That's okay. Yeah, that's good. You're easy? I mean, you're mad? Okay, you got it. Okay. Hang on. Line two, give it to that Julio. Okay, give him a kiss. And you're CD2. We have an open line of day 751. Did you hear what I just said or not? Because I'm not really sure like a foreign contact today or not. Line two, that Julio, give him kiss. 751, 9463, 751. So we got hockey fill out there. So I guess that's two of us. Me and hockey fill. We got two hockey fans left in his town until all the snowboards come back. And in the meantime, well, that often is what a game last night. You know, yeah, right, right. I mean, I'm hoping for the best. I'm going to be, I'm not going to be real. You know, I'm not going to be whether these judgemental guys that expects a super bowl of first year, even a second year. But the third. So Jimmy basically what it boils down to is we got three years. I'm not saying we got a winner, but we got to get there. If the Panthers could get to the Stanley Cup finals in three years of existence, the dolphins who've been around since the 60s, you would think that 30 years later we might have a chance to get back in there. Not necessarily win it, okay? And everybody's always ripping the bills. Oh, GD lost all these super bowl. But at least they're getting there, you know? It's nice to get there because you can't win it unless you get there. I know that's a starling concept, but you can't win a stupid bowl unless you get in the game. Here's the market. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. Last night I went to the exhibition game, dolphins. Yes, sir. And I realized why I'd never go to any games. And why is that? The first, the not only do they charge $35 ticket for an exhibition game. Right. They charge $15 a park three miles away. I mean you can't even see the stadium where you can go. That must have been a nice walk to the car after the game. Oh, the poor end. Yeah. I mean the rain was coming down. And I mean, you're shutting them out. I'll wait and want to save money. If you can fund, uh, then every team is guy up with a parking. I mean, cost $15 a park means the way up there. And you're welcome by people. And all you hear away are walking to the stadium is people complaining. I mean, nice. It's amazing. I mean, then all while you're walking, they're scalpers who are starting to scalpe tickets for a pre-season game. A $10 over the amount. You do understand the only reason they had 56,000 people their last night is because they got a captive audience because they they coerced the season ticket holders to buy the tickets for these exhibition games. So it's like whether you wanted it or not, you might as well go because you paid for it. I just I couldn't believe it with all the, I mean, I kind of went because it was an on TV. I mean, I can't believe they can't tell about it. And they're a pre-season game. Yeah, that really blows. And then I'm driving home. I wasn't in the manage. And he said, talking about how people impressed them. And then he said that, uh, three and up, though, the fool, uh, I'm impressed them. I mean, like he had 11 carries for 22 yards. 11 carries 26 yards. 26 yards. That's just a little bit over two yards of carry that ain't got to cut it in the NFL. That's, that's impressive to him. No, and any, uh, stuck to doing out in the game last week too. He had like, what 13 yards has happened? I don't know. He hasn't shown me nothing yet. I don't think he's even close to the real, the local we need. Yeah, he's not close to the real career map doldre bar. I think they ought to dump the name. It's an embarrassment at this point. But I think, uh, I think spikes kind of impressed me. I'm breaking a lot of tackle. Well, even though he had that one fumble, but he did, I, he did play well. I mean, he broke it two rounds for the rest of the losses and he turned it out and gets at least a positive. You know what they say if you can't beat the opposition beat your wife. All right. Thanks, Neil. Have a great day, pal. Yeah, it's glad he had a good time. Hey, okay. He had a miserable time along with a lot of other people. I got soaked, but hey, the dolphins won. And you see, you walk away from an exhibition game and even when you win, which we did, but, uh, I don't know. I mean, winning is better than losing any time you go to a game. But, uh, do you walk away with some feeling, oh, yeah, we really kicked some ass. You know, not really, especially when you play a very marginal team like the Vikings, where still rebuilding from, uh, decimating their team team. Well, Jimmy did a job out of me force a while out again, right? Oh, Malcolm's got a grip on things today. Boy, I'm telling you, the tears are flowing. The, uh, knees are jerkin. The knees, I said. 1235 at Wiod. What do we got left here? We got these, uh, whoio? Nobody wants these damn things. Do we have some whoio's out there? They take this one just for the picture on a cover, huh? Look at the size of those, uh, melons. Carnival del Marangue. Los Armanos Rosario and a bunch of other spics. And we got Bryan Adams, 18 till I die. We got the angels. My boyfriend's back immediately of their hit, which is on their twice to fill up two cuts. The, uh, Shang-Rilais. Remember, walk it in the sand, leader of the pack and, uh, uh, 23 other cuts that they never heard of before. Leslie Gourre, 62 cuts on this. It's a double, it's a double dip. It's a double-dipper two CDs for the price of none. Uh, it's my party, duties turned to cry. Um, she's a fool. I'm going through here to find the ones that you've heard of before that are, uh, really were hits if you're old enough. Uh, and that's it. That's it out of 62 cuts, those are the only ones that are recognized. There might be one or two other who got time. Carnival del Arsaulso, which nobody wants. That nobody wants that great Mestizo, El Tonganeo, which had that really, really great, uh, Makaneda thing on it. Suck it sounded like they were singing in a key too low during the whole thing. Taro, toto, toto, toto, you know what I'm saying? It's just a blows and sting, mercury falling. Nobody wants sting no more. Boy, he sure fall out of good. Everybody's good, Grace, huh? And gin blossoms. Anybody know that gin blossoms? You do? Very mediocre. Oh, like I said, there's a real crappy. They what? They're very popular, but they're very mediocre. Oh, they suck, but they're popular. Well, that sounds familiar. The gin blossoms, there you go, containing, follow your, uh, follow your what? Follow you down as long as it matters. And, uh, and how come they can't write the names on his label here so you can read it? Is that like, R.C. Farsi? The gin blossoms, congratulations. I'm sorry. Almost be a Canadian group. Yeah, that's the new thing. Now it's like the Pup cam on TV. I love the way they do these things for other TV people. Like it impresses the public to do that Pup cam on her. Nobody in the audience, I don't care how stone they are. Nobody wants to watch the Pup cam because first of all, if they're already stone, they're already puking her guts out in the room is spinning and swimming. They don't need that. But for those of us who aren't or might not be, or are thinking about not being, uh, nobody wants to see that crap. But somebody on the inside thought boy, this is really clever and neat. And like at the end of the, uh, each segment on a channel for news, are they still doing that? When the camera kind of like pans back and out of the whole room, starts spinning around and, uh, and Roberts head is on camera. Martins live, which covers both screens. 1230s, she's, there's head on what, 1237, a WOD mic. He was talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. Gordon gives South Florida a major blow job. Now I don't feel all that great. Oh, I hate my skill and I paint my field. Oh, I'm a great, and I got the chill. Oh, I'm a great, and I got the chill. Oh, I hate my field and I paint my field. Oh, I hate my field and I paint my field. Oh, I hate my field and I got the chill. Is that shaking by the distance? It means I agree, ogready, and you got, oh, no, I got to go.

Oh, I hate my field and I got to go. I have a field of heart. I am breathing, makes a goodie again. Prop 44, a Wild, it's a mobile implantation, hello. Hey, how you doing, Neil? OK, sir. Hey, first time caller, long time listener. Yeah, just wanted to touch basically there. I heard you talking about the digital satellite system. Yes, sir. And I'm a customer scholar of the units. And I can tell you, some of the differences. The Sony is a little bit faster changing channels, but not that much. It's not really enough, so it's really notice. OK. There are a couple units out there, you know, like the pros scan. I don't know if you've seen that one yet. It actually has a channel modulator built into it, where you can watch that particular receiver in other rooms along with regular cable. It actually creates its own channel. So that's real good for people who are not buying multiple devices. Right, right. You can watch the set again. You can watch the satellite receiver in all the rest of the house on the regular TVs with regular cable on an upper channel like channel 94 or 95. It actually creates its own channel. I got you. So regular cable goes up to 65. The pros scan will create channel 95. And then you can watch it on the rest of the TVs in the house with only one receiver. Hmm. But you can still watch one program at a time. Yeah, and you can add a house. Yeah, you can add as many receivers as you want. Right. A lot of people say, oh, you can only add two. You can get the right switches in the right part. It's not all it takes this money. Right. So you can put receiver on every TV in the house. It's a right part. I know RCA makes pros scan, right? That's correct. So the original RCA is that like history now. No, they have a second generation that's out now. In fact, they had a rebate going. It's extended through the 25th of this month. And that is still current. As far as I know, they're telling us that they're just back orders. You know. Okay, but what's the difference between the second generation? Just the fact you can add more sets. No, it has a different user graphics. As far as the menu. Different fittings on it. It has capability to run your VCR. It'll do one time recording where when you push a button, it'll actually turn your VCR on, start a recording, change the channel for you and stuff like that. Just like the VCR plus works on a VCR with a cable box. Right. The satellite dish will work the VCR. Great. On the upper unit, the more expensive you can. So when you do check that out. That's on the, that's on the second generation. Right. The more expensive model. Right. And the pros scan has all that built in. The pros scan comes with a infrared repear system that plugs directly into the back of the unit where you can change channels from another room. Right. So it's all built in and included in that. Why did you get in a different kind of remote? Exactly. You get a second remote and then you can take that remote and leave it in the other room. Right. And with the channel modulator that's creating that new channel, then wherever room you're in, you can change the channel on the satellite dish even though you're not the same room. Right. So it's good. There's a lot of new ones coming out here in the next few months. They're introducing a lot of the different companies, the Samsung and all the other brands are going to be coming out soon. And it's, you know, it's really the way of the future. But I don't know if you know going on now if the people buy a new unit, they get the NFL ticket, you know, for, yeah, I mentioned they yesterday. Brand that's in all the ads. Yeah. Right. I bucked up until the, I think it's important for PC. People are very confused because the, once you're talking about now are all connected with direct TV and USB. In other words, those all get the same programming. That's correct. However, the things like this TV, which had that big out a few weeks ago, the dish network, the dish network, that's a whole different ball game. It's got different programming. It doesn't have direct TV. It doesn't have USB. That's the government. It doesn't have the, they're not going to have the football package this year. Right. And so people got to be alert to that because, you know, they're in. And then, of course, you also have to pay the $300 annual thing up front along with the charge of the, plus you don't own it. Well, that's what is bringing down the price. That's why they can advertise the cheap price. They're getting you to sign up the programming for three years or year, whatever the package is. Right. And you have to pay that and that subsidizes some of the price. Kind of like what's the telephone to. Right. So, but that's really the packaging. The programming is limited on the dish network to where, like you mentioned, they don't have the sports. They don't have a lot of the other programming. They call it their top 40. But they are launching, I think, two new satellites in September. Yes. Well, there's one common within the next 30 days, I believe. Right. And the other, I don't know how soon that'll be to follow, but sure, it'll be with the next few months. And that gives a more channel capability and whatnot, but still, it's matter of the programming. And pretty much direct TV and USCC, because they were the originators. They've got all the contracts, they've got all that stuff locked up. Right. You know, of course, you know, all it takes as money and anybody can get anything. But, well, if you buy the Sony or the your pros scanner, the RCA, you've got a capacity for 1,000 channels on your so no matter what they add on it, because they're also putting new birds up there. So no matter what they add, isn't it too more they're putting up? Uh, you're there. Yeah, they're answering stuff all the time. I know they just added, I don't know how many do I have up there now, three or four? I don't know. I don't know. But I think they're putting two more. Yeah, they're all adding, they're all adding channels. Eventually it's going to be, you know, the 500 that they've always talked about. It's just going to take time. But the originators of it, you know, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the different companies that are involved. Uh, you know, they have a big one. So they've got some money. So they're going to do it. They're going to be it. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Appreciate you here. Okay. Bye. See you in the way in screaming in the only guy that knows what he's talking about. Thank you. Profusely, pal. We have an open line in date. 751, 100 perpeline mobile on cell ATNT wireless pound ID and to it. We have to for 9463, 524WYOD. Those trends should be offloading off the things starting about one o'clock. They should be downloading. And I think that you better make a lot of room down in the, uh, men's room down here because it's going to be a lot of downloading going on down there once those numbers come out. 1250 at WIOD. Eddie Test. Cause it's geeking of the wild frontier. He had up in old Montana for 17 years. The power or water just to couple up deer. Now he's reading history books while sitting in jail for all the little packages he's in an email. Teddy. Ted. Cause it's geeking of the wild frontier. His brother got a hunch called the FBI.

He'll go to prison for life plus 10. Probably read the Bible and confess his sins, but no one our system and our land to labor. He'll get Johnny Cochranani who walks got free. Teddy. Cause it's geeking of the wild frontier. So anyway, I'm watching Yonge and Jorge during the commercial break. What amazing timing. I think they knew that we were going to have our break at that time. Then they called you early to find out what our log schedule was. And so Victor is sitting there at the desk with that wrinkled about push and Nick walks in and says, I want to go to Copenhagen with Neil. Ted. Sounds good to me. But I'll tell you, call up Rob in the jeweler. Okay, let's see if we can get a good price. 12.55. It's Wild. Here's Miami. Hello. Any else? Yes sir. How's it going? That's it. Did you have there for the Tongoneo? See? That is a dance that is replacing the Macarena. I ve. Oh, I. El Tongoneo. You got it. That is the new dance crazy that is coming from Latin America. Well, maybe we can preview it now. It's on here. Oh, as you would expect. That's an idiot. Okay. I also had something else to regard in the cable company and the dish. I've been trying to get this mold dish. I live in a condominium association. No, geez. Okay. Well, it happens now that the association does not allow, they consider the small dish, a modification of the exterior of the unit. Oh, blowing up the right. So they don't allow it. Now, TCI has started. I mean, dipping in my house already more, more times than I actually spent on my own house. Yeah. They're threatening, well, if you don't connect your cable now, we're going to really disconnect the ground and it's going to cost you more money when you finally decide to put it on. See, look, I'll help you remove the box. Yeah. I'd rather have the rabbit ears which I have now. Right. Better than you're stupid cable. Okay. I'll tell you. I'm trying to find out if they're, if they're what they're embedded together with the association or what the deal is, because I see other condominium associations in Kendall that allow this mold dish. Yeah. These people will not have already checked and jumped up and down and complained to everyone involved. They will not allow it. If I put it, they'll slap me with a lean against the unit. And meanwhile, TCI cable, they're running the whole show. I'm running by the, they're putting it on. That's a little on-set twist relationship to me. They're requires a good lawyer sticking his nose into it and threaten the loss. I'm going to do something. If I had the money, I would definitely follow the lawsuit because I really think that there's something more there than meets the eye. Yeah. I mean, and especially now, I mean, it's like every day I get a new flyer stuck to the door. This is your last chance. I mean, this is your last chance. This is your absolute positive last chance. Yes, that's right. That's the answer. Okay. I'll help back at my own toolbox and help it remove that box. Okay. Just so I don't see you guys here anymore. Okay. So, but well, hey, I wish I could have the dish before now. I'll talk with the rabbit ears. Get yourself a lawyer, Pral. Uh, I will. Okay. Okay. Good luck. There were their boobs hanging out. Yeah. I noticed you were grabbing at the TV set for that. You don't like your post. I was just doing the bra effect there. Yeah. A little lifted stuff. It's really interesting because her right one is like one shape. You notice that? Hefty lefty, lighty righty. And the exactly. No, the other way around. The left one is like kind of bent out of shape, if I can say that. Here we go. Forget the macarine. Maybe that's yesterday's rule. Jesus. Here we go. Get those arms up in the ear. Come on up above the table at least. Start slapping them like a bird. Hey, you can say it. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. El Congo Neo, I bet you're doing it on top of each right now.

Look at this, how there be sponsors dropping off as we get fewer and fewer of us. Things here left. How do you like that? What did I tell you about sting? Nobody has their, no, there's no interest. Mercury is falling and so is his career evidently. Nobody wants to sting, seed. That's a pretty sting and commentary to me. Nobody wants to gin blossoms because George said they suck even though they're very popular. Certainly nobody wants Leslie Gore, a double CD 62 cuts 62 cuts. Well, give it to you, please. Nobody wants to shank with us. I can understand that. Certainly nobody wants the angels. Nobody wants Brian Adams. What's wrong with? Okay. And one of the cuts is that want to be your underwear. And but please keep the stains in the front. And carnival de Marrangue and the other right. Nobody wants the Julio stuff. Okay, that's all right. We want to play hard to get. That's fine with us.

I don't know how you do it. Well, because of you, people look at me and they think I'm crazy when I'm laughing. They say this guy's by himself laughing so much. Yeah. Well, anyway, I wanted to clear something out there about the cigars. Do you want to, are you listening to me? Yes, I'm here. I'm here. I'm just in a coma. I'm right here. Well, you want to enjoy talking about the savoury and the was the other one. The cacique. Right. However, it means great in his pick. Yeah. It means great. Cacique means Indian chief. That's the cacique. Indian chief. Exactly. Cacique is the Indian chief. Yeah. You can ask anybody that I know Spanish, you know, the number. Except George of course only rose like all the swear words. No. Yes. I'm a very shy guy. But I like to have two shambles. I don't kiss on the first date. Okay. What is it? I have to share those requests. Last Monday. Now yesterday. Well, last Monday. You play a card of an oriental guy. I wanted to buy a restaurant. Oh, geez. It was a funny thing. Oh, okay. Please, Neil. Okay. It was the racist card that there is an artilux you and artilux you and also have the Irish guy. An Orthodox you and the Irish guy. And what are they talking about? Well, they're also just talking about he went out with the girl. She was so you and you know what? Shape like the star of David. You don't remember. No. And either this George will have you played it a couple of times. Okay. It's really funny. Do you have the Irish guy that comes up to work and the Irish guy comes after work? Yeah. I start talking about that. Okay. Can you play the one foot from the oriental guy to the restaurant? Okay. Be happy with that one. Okay. Have a great life. Okay. All of a sudden, man, my hit is swimming. It's spinning like a drail. Okay. The restaurant, Chinese restaurant. We've only heard that 400 times, but it's okay. Sounds really desperate. The Jewish guy and the Irish, the priest. Here's Boca. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Okay. I just wanted to bring to your attention. I don't know if anyone will let you know today. But Clinton's endorsing a plan for some NASA people to go to Mars over in the next like 15, 20 years here. Yeah. They're not opening one, brought it up to your attention today. They did not, but I understand that the rumor is Pat, you can't in Bob Dornan are going to be on the ship. They're going to be the first ones to go. Hopefully. Sounds good to me. Another thing, uh. Also, Archbishop O'Connor from New York. He's going to be on there. Yeah. You wish. He's out of this world. Another thing, I don't know, just a little, uh. And here at Bauer and Ralph Reed, they're going to be on it. But anyway, go ahead. Yeah, did you hear about this, uh, gorilla, some kids fell into a gorilla. Yeah. I saw 45,000 times over the weekend, just like you did. All right. You know, how about a seamless request? Did you hear about Jimmy the gorilla? Yeah. Dad. Dad. A lot of gorilla news over the weekend, huh? They made a big gilla over the weekend. He's gone over the phone. Yeah. On the Phil Henry show. Right. Yeah. Can I get a seamless request? Well, I'm there backing up now, whatever you want, pal. Can I get the bokeh song? Boca. Thank God. I'm fine. Thank you so much. I'm ready to. I know. Finally, something I know where it is. Oh, this thing with these CDs with these discs. What day is it today? October, uh, September, uh, January. What is it in it? Oh, man. Also, we got this kiss. It's a Georgia that's pretty crappy because it's all live. But it doesn't include a bonus interview with Jay Leno, which I should have told that out because now nobody will want it. Jay Leno. I'm sorry. What, it would be side the chin. What's the dealer, huh? Besides the gray here in the chin, please somebody tell me. We have an open line in Broward, 5249463524WOD and a pair on a green lines as they've run out of interest. Okay. 1-800-944-9463. You got to be loose those green lines pretty soon, by the way. That's the rumor we just started. At least that's the game plan that we had. But then, of course, there was a little problem in it. A little flying the equipment. Probably not safe to want to tell you why I'm decent. This is Rick Riley and with the sun's Coleman, I do the morning show. I've been home, my list of the fill headry show, two to six of the afternoon on six to double the ID, so everybody voice the first of it. Fill Henry, two to six PM on news, talking entertainment radio, six to double the IOD. I'm also talking happy. Yeah, I couldn't even find out that you're just on a social show. Yeah, huh? Yeah, huh? Uh-huh. We're on the game. Patrick? Yeah. I just thought it was supposed to talk to someone named Fu. Oh? It's not Fu. Okay, hold on to second, okay? Yeah. Hello? Yes, yes. Yeah, who's speaking? Yeah? Hello? Who's speaking? Hello? Can you hear me? Yeah? You got a restaurant for sale? Huh? How much you want for this one? Well, you come here to look at it and talk to the boss. I come over, maybe eat dinner with you. Okay. Does that price include all the walks? Huh? Huh? How much? 1,000. 1,000. 1,000. 1,000. 4,000. 2,000. Okay. You can go to the store. No, no. 4,000. 4,000. I'll go. Go. Go. Go. I'm going home. No, no. Okay. I can go over there and look at the restaurant. Okay? Okay. What do you want? Uh... You know... I'm going to go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Okay. Okay. I'll go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Okay. 117. W mild. I'm a soccerer. Round for that nice thing. Speedy. Soccer. Soccer. Yeah. Very big. I'm very fee-peasy. I'm proud to have a son of a round. But if you give me that CD, I promise that I will do. Well, maybe... I'll turn around for that crazy, sweet baby. I'll be right back. I'll turn around for a round of you, Panther. It's so he has me, to... Yeah. Well, I'm glad he hung up before I could. It's 118 at W-O-D. By the way, he did say suck around each and every time. It wasn't always real clear, but I just want you to understand that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, at least he brought him in so they can't be that bad. But guess what? Okay. But got some numbers for you here. And I think they're going to be really weak. Let me take a peek. Let me take a peek. No, they're not. They actually went up a little bit. How they'll do that happen. What they'll could that have been? What's the been, Aaron Summers? Okay. So, we're going to go from 5-1 to a 5-3, which is, you know, nothing to write about that. What is that? Oh, that's midday. 5-1 to a 5-3-25-54, which means we're doing close to a 6. We're right up there around a 6. What's wrong with that, huh? Oh, there you go. So, that's not too bad. Not great, but considering the previous two months, we had to have a pretty good July, huh? We had a good July. All right. How about the rest of the day? Okay. Rick, you see, Rick's not in town, so we don't have to worry about him getting all bad on a shape. How about a fill-hentry? I don't think he's leaving, but he ain't leaving for like a month and a half. So, let's see, 3-1 to a 4-point. Oh, wow. Woo! Heavy duty. Phil Henry went zooming up there, and of course he's leaving. I think these things must be fixed. But that's the biggest trend. Phil has had an ages. Can you believe that or what? A 3-1 to a 4-point zero. Unbelievable. And, uh, 6-10 AM, let's see, 25-54. 2-2? I guess that number is just, you get hung up on him. You know what I'm saying? 2-2-2-2. It's still the same. So, there's some numbers for us. Interesting numbers. Uh huh. Okay. So, Phil's like, make a nice big comeback here just in time to be seen. Goodbye. Nice going, smart ass. Oh, I was supposed to play this. Oh, there's a model that's placed on, uh, on. Well, they will see people go. It's where royalty, they follow. And that's what I like about Velka. A down where he goes on Evans Mall. A down where they say, and how tall. And every corner has a ball. And that's what I like about Velka. I'm playing. Spin 10 grand on golf course fees. Spin the day in Jewish bakeries. You should taste these delicacies. And that's what I like about Velka. But please excuse our added foods. And our BMWs, and we find pleasure in being rude. That's what I like about Velka. Gucci belt and Rolex watches. White shoes make us so obnoxious. If you're clean, let you touch us. And that's what I like about Velka. We really don't have what you think. Do you see how a do-do doesn't stink? There's no coffee. Only Velka. And that's what I like about Velka. That's what I like about Velka. I noticed QAM had a two-five at a morning up from a two-four. They're like inching very, very slowly. In other words, if they can keep that worsty money for another ten years, they might make it to a three. But they still be rickened spud there. It's a good thing those guys are out of town. Two-five to a two-two. Don't be rippin' him next Monday when he comes back and starts with a two-two crampil star crying right on the air. But anyway, so well we did okay. And filled the pre-dame good. How do you like that for a guy who's leaving? I have a feeling it's that sympathy vote. Do you know what I'm talking about? Are you positive? 122 at WIOD. News talk at entertainment radio. 16WIOD. What 26 at WIOD the coast in the morning in morning drive dropped from a, what is it? 47 to a four-three must be Johnny Dolan. Don't tell me the audience can't stand Johnny either. Howard had a gigantic trendy one from a six point. Oh, with six point five, I think that's his big number so far in 25. 54 is number two though, a distant second to radio Amor with a nine point. Oh, what? They're just killing everybody with that hoochie kuchi and at the cramp. And the hot bounce back a little bit five five to a five eight. That's bad news. Zeta five, oh, to a five two in the morning 25. 54 is that is this it? That's all I'm going to get. I guess maybe I don't know. Maybe the donkey died. Maybe Nicola passed out of the carpet. I don't have no idea. We'd like to see the men. We'd like to see 18 to 34. We'd like to see a little bit more than just this. We'd like to see some other stuff, man, so we can kill some good time with it. And by the way, and he afternoon 25. 54, how to held it the hammer do? I don't think too good. And he afternoon I think that was an aberration at last when we make no mistake about that. Phil had a four and the Humphor had a two point four. That's almost like double. Here's Miami Beach on a purple line. Hello. Yes, with these deplorable plane crashes, it's a miracle that more people weren't hurt or killed on the ground. Let me say, let me say, Phil, we're going to miss you buddy. Neil, you're the best. So where's the worst person is? Okay, here's the plantation. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Hey, hey, listen. I want to ask you about this. Drew Rhodes and House. How come will these sports and outs are stuck up to this guy? Like he's on type of a guy? He's still out of me, man. They had, they were massaging every part of his body last night before the game. I was, I was reviled and nauseated. And it was at that point. I said to myself, if I see none of this game, it'll be way too much. I mean, you're right. They get him on there. They don't ask him one tough question. Like they bow down. Right. And when you come right down, well, what do they need him for? What do the sports writers and broadcasters need him for? He's a motor mouth and never shuts the right. You know, I mean, he just, and the way he talks, you think he runs the whole team. He's going out of a wild Jimmy, a such a great guy to deal with. And he knows numbers. He knows how to make a deal. And he's much better than Schuillow was. And this one's going here. And wait till you see, this one's coming back. Eric Green is going to have him back here. And I mean, you think this guy runs the whole damn league. I know. I think he's on the top of all he's bragging about. He had about a third of the players on the contract. Yeah. And I guess I've done it. He does, you know, but I mean, the guy drives. Including just burned brown by the way, Mr. Toast. He went out and elected Europe about how bad JB felt because he was on a second string. And he's played more games. He started more games than any dolphin except Marino. And all the other bull can. He sucks. You know, get rid of him. We don't care how many games he started. He blows. Let me ask you. Did you in hockey, hockey, Did you read this? What's his name? Stan Fistler's article about. He's a guy that the Panthers have lined up the door mat in the Atlantic division. No, I did not. Is that in the new one? See, what's on here? August 31st. No, I didn't get that yet. Yeah. He says, which is named Stan Fistler. He says the Panthers could be the Atlantic door mat. Yeah. In other words, the way he describes like Joe Vanowski and Beamer and McLean are all going to fall apart. You know, and they'll probably end up in the last. Yeah. You know, I mean, no change. I say, bebeamer. No change. Yeah, the Beamer. Yeah, it's a. Yeah, it's just a short article, but he's cool him. Screw him. Screw him. Screw him. He's just another star puts from New York. And I think the dolphins, I think they're playing Tampa Bay twice, so they can build up their ego when they go into regular season. You know, we have a big build up. They'll have a couple of winters. They just barely pulled that first one out. And that is at home. They barely pulled it out. Yeah. And he chance getting a CD. Which one? Um, kiss. Kiss. Okay. You got it. Okay. Hang on. Take care. Okay. Line four. And he owes that Julio a kiss to because he didn't take it before he hung up. He didn't want that. He wanted the crow. You want crow? You want kiss? You want kiss? Did you want this? So here's the numbers. And at least we're still hanging in there until a big transition until something starts happening around here. We're just hanging in there by our thumbnails with about a six year. That two shabby. I don't think so. I don't think so when you're covered down. What we're doing somewhere between a five six and a six year and mid day. And it's like a five fifty four with absolutely total in difference without any kind of ass assistance without any kind of interest even without the MRK on there for the illegal aliens on 79th street. Here's a nice trend Andy. Four point. Oh. What? You'll have to four point. Oh, and a trend. It's an sizeable from a three one to four. And then slap the crap out of the hammer. Slap the hoppers butt. Slap them right in the. Right. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. Good. I don't want to slap the humbers but thank you. Oh, I'll pass. I know you're going to say that it's it's things, but I've got crimes. But the humbers but stinks. I bought yeah. I've got a margin. I've got prime star because that's what my building has. Oh, they have that set of cables. That's a cable rip off. Well, but the only thing good about it as opposed to cables. I get the NHL package and everything which I couldn't get with cable. Yeah, like I said, it's very just having the cable. Right. Exactly. I'm stuck with it and it's better than nothing. But so how does that work? I mean, the whole building is got it and you. They've got instead of their cable in other words, but then you can you can buy the options independently like the like the NHL. You know, like you can do that. Yeah, sure. You can buy that. You can buy the, you know, the any of the sports package is separately. But wait a minute. Does everybody have to have their own box? Yeah. Oh, yeah. We all have our own box. They just use like I guess, you know, there's like a bunch of little dishes. I think there's like six of them on the roof. So I guess, whoever, you know, each, each one has seats, certain parts of the building. Well, if nice to see the cable people are like, you know, just hanging on by their thumbs too. Well, I'll tell you the cable part is horrible. I mean, it's worse than cables. As far as the stations you get, but at least I do get the sports stuff. Yeah. But in the meantime, as far as these games go, you've been asking somebody to tell you, I think what it is. Like, for instance, this game from our night, I'm getting it on pass, you know, from Detroit. Right. So 320 on the on DS, on direct TV. Well, I'm going to be like, channel 46 or so. Okay. But as 320 one on your big dish, right. But in the meantime, I don't get it on anything. I also look like the Mar and I know what time is it listed. It says 730. Right. Right. So I mean, which still is going to be on tape. But I don't think it's going to be on sunshine. So I mean, I don't know what people do if they don't have, you know, something that gives you the pass. Or, you know, maybe it's on FX. I don't know. I get FX and it's not, I don't see it on there. No, but I have seen FX running promos that they're going to be carrying these games. But this one, I don't know. I know that in the on the big dish, it's got tomorrow night's game listed on every prime network on every, uh, I mean, all over the place. That's how most of the other games are. Right. Up for tomorrow night. In other words, all the rest of these games, it's only every prime network. And I saw Madison Square Garden. Right. You know, it's on everything. I sunshine. What is sunshine got? They got the governor picking his nose tomorrow for two. Yeah, fast fishing or something. Yeah. That's right. But I think tomorrow is best fishing for that. I'm searching for baston as nose. Yeah. Something like that anyway. But anyway tomorrow, it says it's on past. So at least I hope I'm getting it anyway. Because I'm still hot. I need my hockey. May man. Yeah. Well, anyway, it's got any more CDs. Yeah. You don't have the cranberries still do you? No, I sure don't. Oh, well, well, you forget it. Do you have any ham? Ha ha ha. I got you on the right over here. Hang in there, pal. Okay. We have an open line today. Can I have a ham? We haven't had too many women today. I would have thought some huliyets would have called in for some of that moranghi and salsa crap, but they're not listed there. Busy with radio amor and radio amor romance. See, that's the problem in this time. We'd have a gigantic number on his show and on this station. If we could just get some of those huliyets listed. But hey, we got another. We got all the huliyos. We got another huliyets. They're all sitting there listening to huchi kuchi. And maybe a little Luis. Yeah, I guarantee if we were given away like 10 copies of new Luis Miguel out. All of a sudden they would come out of the woodwork like, oh my god, they just found us. And we still don't have that over here. And I am so parked off at our friends at Wea Latina, which the thing evidently came out on Friday. And here it is Tuesday. And we still haven't got it yet. How do you like that? I don't. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm a question about the small dish. Yeah. I'm sure you probably mentioned, but can you get a different reception and different room that they'll react to what's the same thing? If you get a different receiver, you have to have a second receiver. How much is that going to cost? About 300. So it's what? Five for the first one and three for the second. Depending on which one you get the Sony, I think is 488 now. And so it's like a third. Two thirds more again. Another room. Yeah, it took a second receiver. Because I have a Delphiocabe one hour. Oh, it's not too bad. It's not like, what do you mean? What do you complain about T-Scian? You have a good cable? I guess it's the best one out there. Not comfortable. Don't ever move. Just hang on to a good tight. Also, do you think about installation of the big dish? Does my parents have one? I think that. Actual or like, craft out? Yeah. Well, you want to call my hammer. Is that it? Well, he's the guy to talk to. He deals with the big dish? Yeah. Do you get a number? Hang on. Oh, you also. Yes. Do you still get that gym boss? Got which one? Gym boss. Oh, the gym boss. You actually want the gym boss? It's a new album. It's a yeah, congratulations. I'm sorry. Yeah, I love it. All right. Okay. Line two, given the number, given the CD, and given them the time of day. So I guess that's all Nichols bringing in here is this. That's all we're getting this time is just this. Where's all the rest of the numbers? Man, I want to see the men. I want to see the good men. Oh, man. I can't believe this is all we're getting for right now. Let's come on. Let's go with the men numbers. Let's go with something, man. Let's get something going on here. I want to find out what the lay of the land is here. So I can get really sick before I go to the doctor. 135 at WIOD. Use talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. It's me again. Doosh, when you're done. Are you searching for a new sensation in dining? If you're tired of that same old bump and grind, then why not revisit an old friend and eat it's a why? That's right folks, because here at the why, we've turned our old facilities into a mouth-watering buffet. And you've never seen us. Red like this one. Featuring some of the most delicious on trays. You've ever tasted. And if you've Iced Mexican, you'll love the why because every night is taco night. Or if you enjoy the taste of wild game. Our chef forever lives packing sauteed rabbit baked in a golden flower crust. That's right. Airpied. It's all here. Literally mounds of piping hot food including juicy steaks. Cook medium rare. Because when you eat it's a why, all the meat is in the middle. Or if you like spicy food, here's an unusual on trays. A red hot kitchen new old steak. Talk about a piece of ass that brings tear to your eyes. It's lit, backing, good to show you what what it is. Oh, the next time you eat out, light on down to the why. It just knows that heresy is way up and is for one I think. Eat it the way. Bo-y-o-y. What? One forty one. One forty one and W. I. You know, sometimes I open up these CD's just out of curiosity. Some of these sampler things because they sound interesting. They sound like bizarre, isn't like what tell us is. In other words, here's one that's a polygram sample and is taken from a bunch of original discs and hits. But it's like redone, remixed, rea. Sounds the same to me. Don't it? Okay, let's have one for all the facts out there. We go down a summer. Let's dance. All sounds the same to me. Cranberry's on this one too. And can't be Venice and Jimmy's with him. Rob Stewart and Eric Clapton. And Johnny Gil. And Humble Pines. You walk Junior Walker and he all stars. You gotta be kidding me. Are you, uh... Unbelievable. Oh, and you'll never guess what's on this, which I'm not giving this to anybody. How many times have we lost this? How many times have the gate priest had lunch together? Oh, I want for him and then... Time and living and then that's me. Oh, and then it's time for leaving the hope for one. Okay, so there's one for me. I'm popping that in my box and take it at home. It's 143 a W.I.D. or Saledi Mobile and Plantation on her dime. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? How are you? Great. Listen, I was holding in the days of Tim Blossom's CDO. Well, that's the way it goes. You gotta be quick. What a pisser. Yeah. What a piece of crap. Do you believe it? I can't stand it. But anyway, that was truly all my material. I apologize for that. What was the other CDO had? What do you mean the other? I got Brian Adams 18 to lie die. No, I don't like him. I got one right before Tim Blossom. She said two of them. I got the angels, the shanguilas. I got Leslie Gore. I got that spick stuff. And that's all I got. I did. That's it. Well, I've got a Motown thing here, which is pretty crappy. It's called the sound of young Americans. It's got the marvellettes and the love child by the The Supreme's. No. It's got a bunch of pretty marginal crap to be honest with it. Yeah. It's garbage. It's crap. We don't got nothing you want. No, the gym blocks are actually pretty good. I met them. Yeah. They were kind of nice. Well, I'll be damned. This last guy got, he got more ham and energy in Blossom's at the same price. Do you believe it? Yes, I do. I can't say. Sorry about that. Congratulations on your numbers. Thanks. That's your disrespect. Thanks for waiting. See, she's on her dime and we give the thing away and she didn't hang up. How do you like that? Here's 18 to 34. Now, here comes the real interesting thing. Let's see if Paul Castinova is hanging on there in the morning on Zeta. And he, oh, Jesus, what? What are they doing over there on Zeta? Packs and corporate, packs or whatever it is. Packs and communications. A 10 point, oh, in the morning, in 18 to 34. Of course, we had higher than that on Zeta, 18 to 34 back in a good old days. But hey, you know, they're doing the best they can. Number one by a mile. Guess who's number two, 18 to 34 in the morning. Radio something? Power. Eight point four. But that's all those girls. What do you mean? Teenage girls. And guys, speaks. Well, you don't think they have any holiogaisless in the power 96 year. Very good. You're a dream. And one ratio. Two to one ratio of what? That we have more. Big, look at that Howard with an 8.2 in the morning. But the losing by two points to Castinova in their target demographic of 18 to 34. So they just can have to say, hey, we really want 25.54. Because that's where they're going up. And EDR and while this one and that one. Of course, Rick and Suds 18 to 34 got a 1.5. There's a little bit of a comeback. There's a story. There's a story 1.2 to 1.5. How are we doing 18 to 34? Which every now and then we have a gigantic, you know, we get a lucky, you get a few diaries. Not this time. 39 up to a 4 2. Pretty weak. How about Phil? I wouldn't be surprised. 18 to 34 in the summertime. All those punks out there. I bet she's got a 20-year. Like I said, where is it? Or does it have a W Y O D and the afternoon? I don't see it. They're at a 2.5 to a 3.5. Whoa. A smoking. He's smoking it. And nighttime, the or in summer show 18 to 34. You think that all those over sex hot test dust to run guys would be 2 in their night with their hand on a stick shift. Just waiting for the big one to pop. One five to a 2. There you go. So Phil Henry is on the way to a wreck. I wouldn't be surprised when the summer book comes out. Phil winds up with a 10-year. Just as his parting fart to South Florida. Just to kind of fart in your face on a way out. To say, see how great that was. New people didn't even realize it. Now it's too late. Too late. Now to start sucking up. I'm gone. I'm going for the big time. And how come it such a secret what station you're going to win everybody already knows it? Oh, I don't know. Oh. Who's the things missing? I don't know. Seriously, because I heard you tell one guy last week about, you know, they don't want the competitors to know and listen at and from a, what is that? You just, the more smoke. I didn't want me seeing the air shift, but I can say. Oh, you can say KFI. KFI. Oh, okay. That's the big one out there, baby. Make no mistake about it. Don't be confused with KABC, which will put you into a coma. And unless you're in the right part of town, on you get as a super headed 911 on your radio anyway on seven. What is it? Seven. What is it? Seven. Yes, 79. And the only reason they're on 79 is they wanted to be close to 77. It's that ABC thing, any other, they're psychotic. Okay, where are we going to a mobile in Darrell? Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. You're talking about the small dish. The little one, yeah. Yeah, the little one. Well, I got it. And I came about a, uh, a result of my divorce. He kept the cable like that. Good for you. Yeah, but it's interesting. He got the dish and ditched the bitch I like it. Oh, well, you know, something like that. Uh-huh. And, uh, basically, uh, TCI can send me, uh, a little brochure, $7 off for a cable installation. Yeah. So, I keep sending it back with the written approximate. I got the dish. Mm-hmm.

Well, well, well, well, well, there's some kind of philosophy, a characterization, and the idea of notation, times yüz, time, j opportunities, and the May, June, and July. Three of the prime months in the middle of the baseball season, they have got, they have set the record. Now last year they did pretty, they import. I'm going to say pretty piss-pour. You can't say that though. But man, this is unbelievable. For example, last summer they had a four, two. Okay, in man at night. That's baseball. This year they've got so far, which is like pretty well into the summer, a 2.6, with baseball on almost every night. There can't be one majorly franchise anywhere in America. That's on a radio station. It's got less than a five-share, usually double digits. I know KBC with the Dodgers usually look like a 10-share. But a 2-6 in man, we're not talking about over-or-or, we're not talking about 25-54, we're not talking about 12-plus, we're talking about men. Who listens to ball games, huh? Men, but not too many of them. A 2.6, well, I'm going to tell you no matter what they do over there. They could put Jesus, Moses, and the Phil Henry on over there. It's still the one-share. It's unbelievable. It's incredible, man. That's that there's like a curse on that thing. It's like, so if D. Foe still talking to them, forget it. He is, by the way. Here's Hollywood, hello. Hey, Neil. I'm not doing it. Okay. Okay, listen. Can you believe that a 2.6 for baseball? I don't care about baseball. But he also does either. And there's 11 proof of it, man. Let him go on permanent strike. Right. Listen, I'd like to thank you first of all, 25 pounds and three weeks. In three weeks? Yeah. What are you doing besides the Atkins? How are you doing, are you like doing a current carpenter number in there or what? I'm injecting massive amounts of fuel in my body. No, seriously, what are you doing? I've just been eating salad and steak. And that's it? That's it. I think it was. Lakes and bacon in the morning. Yeah, I think I want to have to get back on the steaks. Well, this this thing with these sausages and the cold cuts, there are too many night trights and too much crap. I got to get back to doing it the way I did way back in the beginning. Well, I kept listening. I'm going to be, I'm going to have to be more selected with my meat. There you can. Yeah. Take to the red stuff. Right. And in any way. I hit the end of the show. I'd like to bring a little seriousness if I could. Oh, geez. Oh, no, you'll, I think you'll, you'll, after you just keep me this good news about losing all the weight and I saved your life and everything and now you're going to get us up. And the numbers actually are up a little bit when we thought we were going to be dead. One, the numbers are going to go sky high when I'm done. Okay. You know, you've asked a lot of questions this past couple of weeks. The right computer to buy where we'll fill entry and up. Yeah. The Panther is going to deploy it. Yeah. We both have a mutual friend that has the answer to all these questions. Yep, Rimmer. Yeah. And he's the dolly lump of the area. And he's the way. Rimmer is the reading. In order since Rimmer has been gone, our numbers are going back up again. Oh, yeah. Now, I don't know if he's still out of town in LA, but he must be because I know there's no way he would come back and then not have my phone ringing off the hook. He, uh, his family, his family took off one out to LA for a couple of weeks. Yeah. I heard he went out of town. Yeah. Yeah. You know, hey, I think it was that in Sessin hockey that killed us during that month of June. I think that was the death now, me and June. Well, I love hockey. I do too. It's my favorite thing in the world almost, but I'm going to tell you something. I think we overdid it. Absolutely. I think we paid a wicked price. Yeah. Well, it just ran the bend. Although, let me ask you this much, if that was the excuse for the whole station going into the toilet and May and June, how come American studs still a stud still have a two, two there in the morning in July? Make no sense. I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to have to ask Rick that on Monday when he comes back. That's the first thing I'm going to do when I come. I'm going to come in extra early on Monday and confronted with that two, two. Get a right between the eyes. Exactly. Right between the legs. And listen, I don't want to see me. I don't want dolphin tickets. Yeah. But I did mail you a BCR tape a couple months ago. Of what? And ask you if there was any way you could copy one of the CBC. Oh, yeah. Thanks for the tape by the way. I appreciate it. Have a great day. Bye. Okay. Yeah. All new suckers out there. They're one copies of hockey games, uh, porno videos, uh, soap operas, horse races, whatever. Just send me a free video. Okay. Just send me a nice brand new six hour VHS. Whatever brand I prefer, of course, the better brands the upscale. And I'll see if I can get around to it. Hey, this guy sends me a tape. What I make a copy of a hockey game for him from the CBC. Like I'm going to like, you know, you got to go through the things with the wires. You got to hook your two VCRs together in didler. Forget it, man. But thanks for the tape. It was a good one, too. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. I think he's going to get on. You're it. Listen, no time's right now. I weren't attacking you on a couple of things. But uh, one thing that I'm like, you, uh, I travel right. And every day I'm seeing these thinkers, I don't know if it's a local media, but it's kind of I'm starting to get worried. I usually blow it off. But every usually blow it on and President Clinton's personal entourage throwing Wyoming or something. Yeah. Every day once I down in Europe yesterday, yeah. It's just it's kind of getting to me. I don't know. So you get loaded paranoid. Well, yeah. You know, I always blew it off, but starting to get you know, you keep seeing that you always blew it off. And now you're paranoid about it. I can understand that with all the diseases going around. Yeah. Well, listen. Yeah. I know, I know times when I know, but if tomorrow you could do me a favor, you'll make my day. If you say Larry King, when he's all the third. Right off the bat. All right. But right out of the box. I love you. You got it for you. See ya. Bye. Okay. What do you say? So 3564, we're almost out of time. We were, let's take a look. If we got some other story here, that's what you do in the numbers come out. You keep looking and look, oh, here's the story. We did we went up a tent of a point over here. Let's see, morning drive. Two seven to a two five. Uh oh, uh oh, down in the morning, uh 3564. Five seven to a five four and midday. So everybody dropped a notch, 35 and three six to a look at that. Phil Henry got the old people. That's what that's all about. 35 to 64. We're going to miss you, Phil. Coming up another hour. I'll have my reprogramming WOD. My Emmy Ford Latter Day. Here's talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD.
