If it sounds on the air like a little bit of a hollow sound, if it sounds like the phone is feeding back through the board again. If it sounds like we've got for the 85 million times the same technical screw-ups here, guess what we do. Okay, so just grin and bear it. Just grin and bear it. Put a big smile on your back, don't push in. Everybody will feel it's okay. We have an open line in date. We got one on the purple line. All a proud vanished during the news. Of course, at 5249463, all three open lines in Broward are sitting there very quietly. And they're wondering, boy, it sure sounds funny. Don't it? I can barely understand what they're saying. Here's Westchester. Hello. Neil, God. Yes, sir. Neil, I'm just as frustrated as you are with these damn dikes. I've been waiting a week for one of them to see if they have the cahones to call up and argue their point, you know. You know, and nothing happened. Well, I'm not waiting for an argument. I'm just I'm waiting for some dike. I mean, obviously, dikes know other dikes. They know what this is all about. Why don't we have one bull dieke out there who will call in confirm that these are mostly dikes who are competing in a so-called women's sports. They're not women's sports. They're bull dieke sports. I know. And I know for a fact they're out there. And they listen to you show because my wife used to work in a place. Your wife is a dike? No, no. She used to work in this place. They had like a whole colony of dikes. Yeah. And by the way, they're worse than men when they get obsessed with a woman. Really? And I guess they wanted to slam the dikes or do you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. And he's smoking. Yeah. And there was only one lady died there that called you once. And that was when all hell broke loose when somebody said something. About about that traffic girl. That Latin traffic girl. Right. And she really chastised you guys. She even said that you guys played with your baby. She said, you know, you're a baby. You're a baby. You're a baby. You're a baby. You're a baby. You're a baby. Are you a baby? She even said that you guys played with your baby. That was too long and stuff. Isn't that your life? Is she afraid of you? Yes. Yeah. She was a dike. Did you know that? Because my wife knows she was working there. The time she was cracking up. Yeah. She couldn't stop laughing because she said that. Remember she said you was from Madrid. Oh. Yeah. Right. Am I wife and I I think I had one of the few people I got that joke. She was laughing all day, hysterically. Believe me. What did we call that bit with the traffic porridge? Would you keep it in a what do we call right right? Right no she didn't have the great as oh yeah she didn't Aaron was supposed to have a traffic or that's what that is yeah I think it is I think she called that same the same few days well we'll keep we'll keep banging on him so to speak we'll see if we can find some dichot there with some big with balls enough to call they should have they should have on Tony they should have the big ones no Cape Town see you so anyway the traffic update is a service so be only spots that we got it's a parking lot now and about better espresso you know we got the usual delays it's rush hour we got a few pollutions one at 27 Avenue another one at 47 Avenue could be northbound I don't know why they're not gonna either could be eastbound we don't know we can't see nothing from this room it don't have the windows it's backed up on major problem all the way around the being curved and I'm talking about my ass that's your eye a spy don't should be out of this guy traffic from your traffic checka I'll say yes okay Steve how was that do you think I could have the job please I got a great ass. Rectom okay there she is and of course that was another one of the great chapters in the history of WOD certainly hope that you've been listening long enough to be to have lived through all of that to survive through all of that with us because I've gone home and written in my diary to open lines in date 751 WOD one in Broward five here's a West Palm Beach hello yes sir how's it going okay I would never try to defend the the terrible way that they handled that bomb up there but one thing I think that nobody mentioned yet how come nobody also's got an opinion on it except the one guy that was screaming and carrying on that I meant I copper something how come nobody also's got an opinion whether they acted though whatever they did terribly but in defense you know the white man which I have more to say about that called on the phone I'll say white on that yeah they didn't you hear the reports that the guy that called in the the three nine one one yeah was a white male yeah I have some more to say about that in a second but first of all he said that it was going to blow up in 30 minutes and it actually blew up in 21 minutes yeah so not that you know they shouldn't have really so in other words they should just have taken him in his word and just took took their time is that it oh he says we got 30 minutes so don't sweat it okay right let him finish the song let him finish the song and you know yeah you tell me with all these experts and spot teams and stuff that they don't have anybody there who's trained to know what to say so that there wouldn't be a panic I don't know but nobody said anything all they did was have that red neck in there who is the head of the security and that the whatever that is title is the the local head which I think is where we are spending his time at the local head and this is a red neck that comes on earth oh yeah we got 100 people off the lawn and yeah we did okay I'm amazing very soon now listen back in the O.J. trial when you remember when Johnny Cochran shot out of his seat and went ballistic when his witness that some about it was here to black man arguing at the time of the murders did you see that part of the test yes and Johnny Cochran shot out of his seat this is 19 nine do you know what what he who cares about Johnny Cochran what does that have to do with anything well I mean I'm just saying that supposedly what Johnny Cochran's point was that you can't tell the story and Johnny Cochran's full of cramps yeah that's what I I say that and so but how come there's a double standard now that all of the news reports were that it was a white man called on the phone for the spot right they identified it is a device sounded like a white man with no identifiable accident that's what it sounded like they were describing because they're trying to narrow it down to some suspects is what they're trying to do well which has nothing to do with Johnny Cochran I know this may come as a great shock to you but the bombing in Atlanta had nothing to do with O. J. although well he is there isn't he let me actually is there isn't he covering it for that frog TV state network there could be a connection there you go I'll get Johnny on it right away two open lines in day seven five one W.

understand you know like Larry you know like Larry King said you know what are you care what who cares I mean you're a big goddamn two-faggot we don't care your Neil yeah who cares that what do you mean who cares in other words you you want to watch a bunch of so-called sports with with supposedly women athletes or nothing but a bunch of bullbikes on steroids is that you're idea of watching sports I think somebody ought to care in other words if they want to call at the dicolympics fine but how about a little truth and labeling I tell you how I'm a jiu-fag okay I have no problem with that why can't these dikes be a little bit more intellectually honest is there something wrong with them they're not there to talk they're there to do their sports they're there to beat the crap out of each other right right right they're there they're they're to dike it up right okay right right okay bye thanks I was on a street in Pembroke Pines last night that's called dikes have you seen even one of the even one of the swimmers are nameless van diken one of the dikes whimmers there I mean you know that most of these uh women so-called women athletes are bullbikes how come these people are so slow here I said oh who cares don't tell us these things we don't want to hear it even though it's true they already have the gay olimpics let the fags go to the gay olimpics except the good looking guys see one thing about the male athletes and I'm not talking about the divers because they're all mostly fags and the in the gymnasts they're all fags and the figure skaters in the winter Olympics we know they're all fags like I said they're all fags is that what I just said if we have any straight guys in the world what would be wrong with having the straight olimpics I said that last week and they all looked at me like what are you talking about you faggot are you trying to spoil our fun what would be wrong with having straight olimpics having a bunch of beautiful young women and beautifully young straight guys there's good looking the straight people in all these straight people are there your Olympics huh all the straight people watch in the old right all the straight people are watching the faggots out there thinking they're watching something that they're not boy they just get sucked in every time don't they they they this straight the straight people just get sucked in every they don't even know they're getting sucked in god almighty see Capri understand that's why we had a great show on Zeta because I had one guy that understood why I was talking about and the other one that was flipping around like a bumblebee and heat that's what made for a great show here I'm sitting here talking stuff and it's like what language is he speaking what is this man saying

you know wait a minute wait a minute what is that spot there on the next thing I'm not doing that spot that's not one of my spots that's a Rick Riley spot yeah don't do the pizza love me do it no we're not doing that spot go ahead what's the question Dave remember a long time ago one day Neil had to go to the bathroom and he kept asking it's a long time ago one day and you're right I remember that day God was in a great day yeah oh yeah I'm alive yeah yeah I don't remember Dave I remember because him and the bread were there remember he said I think he's a coast clear he finds the dead as yet is I was next call I called back after Neil got back in the bathroom he got back like an a minute and a half I didn't miss uh I don't miss a beat and then I said Neil did you watch your hands and you said what's the t-shirt without washing my hands or not I remember that remember I used to I have that on tape somewhere he has to it's so funny and Neil finally got you know better shape that didn't watch his hands and he took a dump so I thought that was pretty funny I got to this for let me tell you again when you go to Michigan State the first thing they teach you is that if after you go to the bathroom no matter which numbers you may be doing you only wash your hands if you need do yeah now if you know how today you know do your business in a sanitary way you don't have to wash your hands like you pull that up without washing your hands I don't know how you can do that well when you when you have the expertise that some of us do like a rush that when you can fold it up into like tiny little you know Dave Neil's a grace but we missed those days with the bird now that was pretty funny now we missed the bird now you're really getting carried away you're really some Neil you got to miss the trees and was one of the final things of all you did that that morning show was the best show that was ever honest in this month that's right about time but you know something you can't live in the past I was just going to say that the best advice that Neil gave remember one time I called you about three or four years ago and I was I said I don't have any money for it they and I was like saying gosh don't you want to put a morning show together and stuff like that and you hauler that me on the phone and said you can't live in the past right that was the best advice anybody is that's right me he wants to resurrect what we had before you can't do it but Dave were you did you plan to act murder in this movie or which apply uh I play a soldier okay you get you get you get a line I did a line no I know that probably did several lines before the movie uh no I'm just ominous looking I got paid a chunk of money just to look mean well maybe some of you like in get another room you know if you if you saw I'm right now trust me nobody's gonna like him okay I gotta go real bad pal so I gotta go real bad just want to memory to think about a new to yeah dumb this goes to show you why the people enjoy the Olympics they have such a richful life here's a guy there remembers the last time I took a dump what they it was what text you were it was how long it took a minute and a half whether I washed my hands what kind of germs if it was E. Coli oh my god that's my amy whew if these people got a richful life or what do you think in LA they'd be talking about how long you know the Michael Jackson took his last BM well you're right I'm

on the sunset and the what do you like yeah the movies that you can go just about to any type of movie that's ever been made whether it's 20 years old or whether it's some little independent film and you can go to a nice theater and watch it yeah people are quiet they're not sitting there with their children screaming and crying and that people are actually silent in the movie and they don't have

and i had the more things change the more they say the same yeah i went to buy some stamps and they have all these cute little things with like jazz musicians and Georgia O.C. flowers and they have some James Dean and he's looking really hot so i know you know and i i go up to pay and the other one they're like six bucks and some chains and the James Dean one which has the same number of stamps is 2995 because it's autograph and i said to die wait a minute autograph by whom by James Dean i'm not kidding i'm not kidding i'm not kidding James Dean maybe Jimmy Dean they're telling it for 2995 with you know the same number of stamps because it's autograph so i tell the guy that he goes oh no it's got to be a mistake you know it's got to be he's only been dead for 40 years i thought i told him but i swear to you this is what the post office is up to yeah much agree robbers over there to post office you're ripping us off we know this game you're pulling over there i also have nothing else happened and i guess i don't get out of the house and not right like most people here yes yeah i was too scary out there i mean you know too many locals but i you know i got into the public to park and like the first few are blue for handy caps you know the first six thousand spaces are blue right right and then the next ones ATM or just think of this if you keep having to walk at two and a half miles to get to the store pretty soon you'll be handycraft two and you can park on one of those five thousand blue spaces well well that's what i wanted to ask you you know after the handicapped and the ATM does think dated there was a new green one with the baby buggy yeah so if you're a green one with a baby buggy yeah you could only park there if you have like a little kids you know yeah so if you're a handy cat so in other words if you want to get up close to your supermarket kidnaps somebody's little kid and stick it in a baby buggy and you can park we have close in personal right right and if you want to take some old people and babies and use the ATM can you park sideways across six of those only fags can do that park on a slant oh this is so amazing it's unbelievable yeah how about if they just had a parking spot for normal people like us i i'm not sure they see the need yeah okay sweetheart take your walker next time okay bye bye so the selling James Dean things at
