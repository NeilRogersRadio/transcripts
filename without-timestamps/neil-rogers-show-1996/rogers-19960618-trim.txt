Although seven of WMDC1 good thing, at least we're consisting. Nobody cares about me. Nobody cares about the value jet. The DFA, it was killing people. And they finally just changed their mind. It said maybe we'll stop for a walk, because it looks bad for us. Nobody gives a flying crap about this stupid judge bitch. bitch. So I say I say let's just cancel all the newspapers and let's just read USA today. Okay in fact let's not read it. Let's just look at the colorful pictures. Okay and a cartoons at the funny papers. That's it. That's all we need to do. Okay, let's just take the sun's cold and approach to life and just be a professional goofballs. Let's sit around eating baloney sandwiches all day without the bread. Watch and start trek and the jetsons. Here's my email. Oh, an email? Yes sir. Yes. I wanted to call you and thank you for the act and diet. Terrific results. That's much. As far as weight, 29 pounds. But the all important trek griserides up around 600 dropped to 123. Beauty. And also the cholesterol dropped dramatically about 60 points. How do you like that? How these skeptics out there that say oh no it's bad you're going to get hardening at the arteries and you're going to get this and you're going to have a heart attack. They're full of crap. And we eat all the eggs. It's really eggs. They have any eggs and ten years eggs and steak and that's delicious. And I love butter and lobster and like stuff. And it's so easy. Right. Yeah. Terrific. If people keep from sending your food it's easy. One thing about Brian Blades is the father of young children. It's really you keep waiting for these guys to be exposed for what they really are. And you hope something comes along to equalize it. You know what you see a guy like Michael Irvin for example. Let's make in the kind of millions of dollars a guy who can barely pronounce his own damn name much less spell it. And you see these guys making millions and millions of dollars for going out there and be a bunch of dumb jokes. And then having to be involved with drugs and all this other crap, it really makes you just sick to your stomach. You know the average guy out there works as brains out day in and day out and tries to support a family and put together a meager existence and tries to keep his nose relatively clean. And these assholes the more they make the bigger assholes they act like. I just can't tolerate it. I can't deal with it. And they get away with it. No day of reckoning. Right. Good luck to us pal. Thank you. And can I suck around for a minute? Line two he wants to suck. Okay that's two us suckers we got on there. We still got nine to go. We got a bunch of those. Thanks again to Mitch from video ways. We hope he had a great honeymoon and we hope that's somebody found what they were looking for but I doubt it. Here's a candle. Hello. Hey Uncle Dale. Yes sir. How are you? Okay. It is not an old few saw I was flipping channel Sunday night and sports rap was on. No I didn't see that. Okay well I'm pretty sure with the man which and I know Ruben was there. Yeah. They were talking about the possible outcome of the trial for Blake. Yeah. And this was only after the fact that the juror came back in our later goals. I want to change my decision. Right. And they were sitting there and you had to read between the lines but they were basically essentially saying the fact that it would be a travesty of justice to throw him in jail because he's supporting his family and so many people are dependent on it. I guess they were like oh Jay. Same thing. Well I guess they were underline. I guess they were between the lines saying look I guess you got halfway you know they weren't in a with an erascial aspect. They were trying to say look you got some black people. They aren't causing trouble. They're you know they're just I can provide for education for the group. Children growing up and all that. Education. Well they were trying to do a Vem. Well I'll just say I never trying to say it was in the nicest terms. I don't know where you got they were saying you got a back eye making money here. You don't want to deprive a bunch of people all that. And they were all agreed with that. They said well he should just get a slap on the wrist within reason you know. And they all sat there and agreed with it. I know man which was there and a room where they're I'm not sure if DFO is there. No I think Bojangels was on because DFO's on vacation. I think so yeah but they were all just you know they were all in agreement with each other saying yeah the poor guy he you know yes support a lot of people and you know it'd be horrible if he threw him in jail. And that's great. Yeah so I hope man which comes over here today and I got two dogs to support man which they can't put my ass away. Exactly yeah anyway what can I set up for a video to one here? Okay Pucker up. Line one take care that guy. Here's an accurate logic of course that second hand so I don't know exactly what was said by whom into whom although I did hear somebody waxing poet and going on a great length about how brilliant an eloquent Bob Rubin was on that show Sunday and of course I don't know because I don't watch that show but I guarantee that if anybody was brilliant an eloquent on a show would have been Bob Rubin and not man with your bow jangels like that that you can go to the bank on. Twelve minutes past noon at WIOD let me if you missed the first annual don't miss the last ever Phil Henry golf tournament benefiting the Jimmy Rice Center Bernie's babes in beer the perfect sendoff for Phil Henry stay tuned to news talk in entertainment radio 16 WIOD. He was his word not as pedophile. Ah this is what we gator with a message from your friends here at the Florida Everglades. Please send more tourists the last ones were delicious. Speaking of delicious by the way how come we don't have a steak house or really good steak house response run a show? You're now I've been doing the ackeens wouldn't you think we'd have a great steak house on here since steak is like the staple of being on the ackeens diet why don't we have that George. We're trying to figure it out in here. Oh well I'm waiting I'll wait I got a lot of time. Didn't you used to have like Ruth's crystal on time? We didn't have a long time ago and then they decided whatever they decided I don't know they don't like me no more. They like me to come in here and spend my money then they like me a lot but that's about it. How about Don Shulos we're pretty close never right there how about the palm now if the palm on is that on keep this game if that palm is as good as the palm in Chicago which they are related they're part of a chain if that's as good then that steak is about as delicious and the electrical intent is anything you're going to pop in your post I'll tell you that right now. I'm just thinking out loud because you know it's just it's just puzzling to me but then when we we're in limbo here we're still waiting for the other shoes to drop and so we got to figure out who's going to be on top and who's going to be on a bottom and who's going to be the pivot man and who's going to be out and who's going to be off the edge and that's still going on here for a week after week and month after month so what's a good thing like I said that some of us are going on vacation very soon and very far away. Let's do a Miami hello. Hey Neil yeah good morning sir how are you good afternoon. Yeah I'm sorry listen first off I'd like to thank you for turning me on the panthers we had a great season and you're a god when it comes to hockey. Secondly I'd like to say that what is it with that Lebo bitch she should be hung and shot maybe he was hung maybe that's what's on the top so to speak Neil is there really after hearing her former husband he wasn't I just heard channel for news not that I believe everything on the news but she was saying I let them go because there was insufficient evidence oh I guess him shooting the guy while drinking is no evidence right I mean see and the fact that he was going to plead no contest first before his sharp defense attorney said hey why not give it a shot we got this bitch is lawyer we got let him go Lebo is your judge here so give it a shot it just goes to show if you're a dumb joke and you got money you guys that was a bad choice of words give it a shot. This I heard OJ is coming out with a new video proving he never played football yeah bad joke listen I'm like news so ground for a video look okay I think if you're a dial tone next I think that means

was right all that heavy suction they were in the beginning and thank you for this and thank you for that and thanks for the memories but I've been sitting here the last two days begging begging begging and pleading for somebody to come misery with me about the great the late mel Allen Israel about the atkins died on our one-year anniversary of our daughter is winning about the all the great progress that people are making whose lives that I've saved and all of a sudden in this most grotesque in sincere way which is so typical of this town now they're calling it oh you're the king you're the queen you're the this you turned me on to the good stuff etc. so on and by the way go buy your own state oh and let me tell you one other thing the people that do get the videos will give you whatever we want don't be asking for a catalog reading from George when he puts you on a th oh my god talk about a snor that's the ultimate that is the ultimate that would be like bringing somebody into a fine gourmet restaurant and saying we're gonna give you a dinner it's like taking somebody off the street some slapper off the street was neat and in weeks and putting him into a seat in a fine gourmet restaurant and saying we're gonna give you a free meal unlimited tabbed and I whatever you want and he says oh yeah but I don't like what's on his menu I think they're just all afraid of getting some kind of how much you got macaroni it they're afraid of getting a fag flick since one of them since one of we ever had those couple times a couple out of how many out of like 500 that we've given out we've had maybe one or two fag flicks they're all getting but nuggets oh and by the way what Zina or whatever her name is over on the beach I got your little video and your son is okay

and at place again it'll be as great even uh most you public wouldn't believe it here's Oakland Park hello hello Neil yes sir it's you know I'm thinking about this blade trial and it's just the travesty you know before the trial even started he was claiming okay I'm gonna look ahead and plead no contest right because it's cut and dried because I had the gun I brought the gun into the situation the gun went off not once but twice he's dead and uh that's it well it looked like he was going to take some form of responsibility right and then somebody said hey wait a minute you know we might be able to get you off here so let's say so to speak right and now Dennis Erickson says great this is the way it was supposed to be because it's not the football part it's his life his future that said stake right Dennis or have another drink Dennis now it's you know that's the whole thing with the talk show too once they started they all they do is pull people up on stage and try to find who's responsible well of course it's the person who did the act is the one who's responsible mm-hmm yeah but you forget him well this is America nobody any more is ever responsible for anything they do that's a new deal now of course not and it's not it's not so much now who's got money it's who can get most glitter in the news that's what gets you that's what gets you more fame than anything else yeah it doesn't matter if you have the money if you can get your face on the news more and more and more somebody will find a reason they get you off okay well somebody just got him off I don't

condo about 90 percent old people they never leave well did I really they have like a newspaper believe it the condo as a newspaper yeah and what they were saying they're one of the ladies in the paper was saying that all our snowbirds will be heading away for the summer oh yeah which means I could go swimming a pool and not worry about anybody's hair wet yeah he didn't even pee in a pool without having a petition drive started you know I jump and I went through this now do that well nobody's there I guess I could do anything now I want great so I'm the guy a couple years ago brought

not a fag I didn't say you were a fag just because you brought me a fag video doesn't necessarily make you a fag that's like guilt by you know association no the guy was weird I don't think the association were a bunch of fags all of one of them was yeah oh the guy was whine one my feet but I'm not yeah so well I think like straight videos do you yeah yeah some of the Peter Norths and I'm

Broward 5249463 oh these cigars are good 524Wild what on the green line 1800 you know something and I just noticed this it's already Tuesday what day did those people come in from a Roma therapy associates anchor which the card is right there thank god because my memory at that good what day did they come in Thursday Wednesday I think was last Wednesday so it's almost a week now right and I noticed they distinct difference in here now yeah and the sir I'm not making that up either I notice they we don't have the mung in here so maybe whatever the hell they did the may have worked or maybe was psychosomatic uh psisomatic here's the hollywood hello hey Neil yeah hey listen I'm sorry just lying as terrible I'm great I just wanted to say I'd never really uh senior before to do it some hockey uh really stuff and uh I hope you can hear me alright and I always hit this like remember but you turn out you look better okay two bad we got that bad phone and two bad you're sucking around so heavy Ray anybody would look better in Raymond Burr he'd not look too good now Opaline at Broward 5249463524Wild D and two on the green lines 1800 9449463 it is really grim man you know all that euphoria all that excitement all that fake enthusiasm we had during the big panther run all through the playoffs and now it's like the same old pushing and pulling and even giving crap away we still can't get these bastards off their lazy ass it's uh very sad look at that look at that phone there man can you believe this even with adult videos to give away how many we got left about six or seven we still got a bunch more to give away even with that there's still out there sitting on their lame lazy ass because we don't want to read the catalog and the names of everybody's that's in them and what positions they're going to be doing how many times they're going to be uh scorch court exactly here's Miami on a purple line hello hey Neil yes sir are you doing buddy I don't know the verdicts out man the verdicts out I asked the judge thanks it up a big refurc in the act is right yeah 27,2,1 two ons beautiful that's great now I'm trying to get my wife on her she's a little bit over wait so but I got a comment to make up on the brim they if I was the one who would have gotten that busted for committing such a hideous crime yeah I wouldn't have been put on trial I would been sent straight to jail or to give a no no test tomorrow what are trying to say what you trying to say is you don't play football right that's right I don't play no football and that's that's a silly game and I mean that guy is guilty I mean I don't know what they're doing sending them out on the street now and now he's probably going to do the same thing again in a couple of years now he's going to go out there and have a few drinks with Dennis Erickson and run fast and catch the ball catch the ball catch the ball and join the system now and you know you heard that OG is going down towards in teamer for our third trip down to South America where those secret trips that he makes well maybe you can go to those old Nazis down there they can recount some they probably can compare notes that's right near what takes a lot of new and have an exam and can I think we're on for you sure hang on thank you there's a holio that's sucking there on a purple line or whatever line he's on I think on a purple line we have an open line at Broward 5249463 and one on the green line 1-800-944-Wild what a really sad commentary this is and I hope that well they're not paying any attention now because they can try everything they they make up their own conclusion that these news departments at the TV stations around town and then they come in and they take you know a little bit of footage like they did from Rick and Susah this morning and they just weave that in there in the background when they give you whatever their conclusion is they want to know all the community is really up at arms right there they don't give a crap about nothing anymore nothing moves the American public because they're absolutely just lame they're absolutely totally positively just without any their limp they're absolutely limp like Diana said in network she said they've eff themselves limp they've shot themselves up and now they just can't even get it up anymore they've had it they've thrown in a towel here's Kendall hello Neil you want please get me off to the dam right of life just seems to suck more and more and more and every day I think I'm going to be more me and I am more me it's not Brian Blades getting off it's Michael Irving getting off no he got off they got another trial coming up for him they'll get off then oh yeah yeah then he'll get off we'll have to get out of the road that's something to do with is getting off I died that's probably what it is I mean I'm sure that White House up in Dallas was a was a load of party but I don't know I could secret to my stomach every day every day to get to worse and worse and what are we going to do? Well you got to start being like everybody else the word is indifferent you got to become indifferent man I think that's I think totally indifferent to human suffering to death the chaos to injustice just become as amazing as it is totally resilient and forget about all of it like the rest of the American people I think those are the people that are living the good life the people who just forget about it like our politician neither the people are living the bad life they you know they got their TV talking head shows to sit down and get their vicarious thrills through that so why the hell should they get all worked up about this stuff they got so many dummies hypnotizing just yeah you're right we're living we're living in a world of morons I mean if Montel and Lisa are on for one more day I think that'll put the whole country road over the edge that'll be the end of America as we know it one more day of that crap I'm just I'm waiting for the next Jim Carrey movie that's that's that's my life oh yeah because that's it cable man cable cable guy that's what yeah I'm waiting to see you know Jim Carrey against like a dish him out another eight nine dollars right to watch him do the same facial stuff you know with the face and the thing up against the glass I'd rather watch one of those videos that you got me okay hang on thank well that was pretty original I like the way kind of sucked his way into that that's online one Jim Carrey and you know I did like Jim Carrey and Batman too the only problem is when you see him doing the same thing and every other movie that he's in you know it gets a little bit on the old side anybody out there see cable man anybody out there see that ridiculous movie and Matthew Brodrick you know it wasn't he was in for the freshman which was kind of a cute movie he was in that movie with Harvey Firesteam what that was the name of that movie Torch Song Trulet very good excellent for a straight-spick Torch Song Trulet he was in that I like Matthew Brodrick there's nothing wrong with Matthew Brodrick except he's getting a little old and long in the tooth but he's okay but he's so desperate he's got to go into a flick like that would Jim Carrey acted like some kind of a goofball and they're paying these guys millions and millions and dollars and suckers like you are going out just like a year rick the other day saying about how he fell asleep in the middle of uh uh what the was that stupid movie with a pig what is that mean babe yeah he fell asleep what now I got news for you okay I can just add people taking their little kids to a movie like that if they're like sadistic but his kids are like 11 and 16 or 15 years older whatever they're how they what the hell did he go to see babe for for eight 15 cheese my daughter says thank you for the video by the way no but i'm serious why would a guy like that go to see babe and then bitch about the fact he fell asleep in the middle of it and you wonder why his kid is running into trees in the woods I think it's a protest anyways allow a 1236 a WIRD you need to know both Yuri and America should be forced to get the word simply not enough back to allow this case to go to a jury or to allow a jury to find and deal to the example this family is completely related to the best talking entertainment radio 610 WIOD a kill the call throw out of the house she had a dead off mother she ended up falling she ended up under elbows and under but she threw a bedmaid gave out for all sitting there screaming and crying and he grabbed me threw me out of the house a kill the call but they liked that money baby they liked that flow was like a ferrofossic man they just kept opening it and opening it and the money kept flowing out when it doubt let it flow out and so if he did beat the crap out of her few dozen times big deal 1239 a WIOD let's do a Hollywood hello yeah Neil listen I want to apologize to you I just got cut off trying to speak to you I got a better phone what I wanted to ask you was kind of a you might say stupid question but when we reach the year 2000 the wait they call the 60s or 60s and the 50s or they call the year 2000 it all worked you're right it was a really stupid question we have an open line in date 751 WIOD we have one on the green line 1800 you know you go to roll and you see on all these ancient artifacts unlike all these built up the Colosseum and the Spanish steps and the all these old ancient ruins and what's left of them and you see on the side where it's like engraved on OX I I and V I I we're talking about like almost 2000 years ago 2000s stick in years ago and we got some history over here all we got is a bunch of strip shopping centers and football players that's our history that's America's Cowboys Indians guns strip shopping centers and football players that's it and dead presidents here's the North Miami Beach hello yes sir are you done okay I OJ keeps going to South America I think he's servicing what's in Rossa Lopez or Rosa maybe he's going down to see a Rosa maybe he's just going down that's what I heard yeah but anyway how about the F.A. you got a love them huh they do this big search on value just like a couple months ago and they say well of course they did bother telling the public they didn't bother telling any of us you know by the way we're telling you right now that this airline may not be safe and it wouldn't be a good idea if you've had your life not to fly value on your jet right yeah I mean now all of a sudden after 110 people get killed are saying well guess what they're miserable failure and they aren't doing anything to assure the safety of the public and there is a shock operation and we screwed up too yeah how about the uh makes you feel real good about the way the government protects us huh well is if anybody really is dumb enough and of course they all are they really believe the government's out there to protect us like the food that we eat and the water that we drink in the air that we breathe the government's there protect us that's why everybody's dropping like flies now well the EPA's protecting us from that toxic landfill now what have you heard about that yeah and what are they doing nothing they're not doing anything they don't even require that place to to uh to test the soil around and that's why I work at an environmental chemistry lab and that's what we do the half of these landslides leak uh huh I mean we know that and in this land so they're not even going to be required to test to see if they're leaking into the aquifer well I know a lot of guys who have leaked into the aquifer and nobody ever did nothing of them yeah I guess that's true how about a video you okay how many we got George you're not in your head but that's not a number for him oh he says enough for you so he must have a lot okay hang on line three well what does that mean we got enough for him how many we got four more four more what phone up phone mole after this guy mole for your money or his Marvin would say you know what that means you know seriously I don't know what just inspired me I could do the rest of this program about raw a Marvin raw man you know what I mean there was an example if anybody wants to know about boy Gary and how confident he was I could spend the entire day talking about boy Gary and about Marvin Rawman who was once upon a time the producer on this program who did all within his power on many occasions to just absolutely deep six this show who hated the show hated me like poison and yet because of the fact that he had his head deep up the program director's ass by the way we're in a hell of a handy lately speaking of that he's sick of the dog according to fill Henry oh well you know when you keep your head up there that long there's a lot of germs in bacteria that may be breeding deep inside any program directors and as a result Andy is sooner or later it all kind of like filters on down here's a mobile in West Palm Beach hello and you'll hear you doing okay I don't want to talk about Brian blades I didn't you think you hit on it enough and yeah let's forget about it okay we're pissed off there's nothing we can do it's par for the course and let's just go on with life right what's the point of getting pissed off let's talk about that makes me a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little family is ecstatic I mean if they're willing to sacrifice one of the family members even though Chuck's family still got that civil suit going but if everybody else is all ecstatic that the money is going to keep flowing in and who are we to bud in hey like they say keep it in the family right that's right keep it in the family they kill each other they you know the only knows what else yeah I actually had a question I don't know if you would have any insight is for this um I wonder if Charles I wonder just one other thing though if Ryan blades would have been a white football player you know and he would have gone in there and uh the same action it would have happened with Chuck blades and he would have died I wonder what the reaction would be in certain parts of our community right now about probably I don't know but uh you could be right possibly yeah I was actually going to ask you question about the panther's there's a new movie coming out it's called white people don't ride but anyway you were saying I was actually wanted to talk about Jason Poodleman who center the cinnamon yeah that we had the miners this year he came up for a couple of games and uh filled in for scrutleman when uh scruble yeah uh yes whatever whatever the name is right screwing that's I had as cancer no balls always gets to talk to screwy and he he talks to screwy all the time I'm really impressed by that these guys to get on there in the morning and they talk to the players you know because quite frankly the player players are good guys there are articulate but they got nothing to say let's face it they got nothing to say players I'm sure they'd rather be playing the game instead of talking about it right or at least getting the family couple of times like sex when you'd rather be doing it or talking about it you know you got it not even about how's no contest do you know anything about this kid because I heard he's got some skates I heard he can really uh from blue line to blue line I heard he's pretty fast good that's what we need is guys who are fast we need some more team speed that was one of our disadvantages against the avalanche right like we like I had called him before we were talking about uh Mark Straukan and and whatnot as far as uh you know him bringing that verse to speed yeah I've been I've been reading some things and I've I've it seems that this this kid is is kind of the the same lines as as far as speed goes that explosiveness from blue line to blue line and you know you know when you get to turn over or whatever in the neutral zone you know next thing you know boom the guys got a shot on goal you know potential for a lot of goals go one of the problems with us is I noticed on the few we didn't get an awful lot of two on ones in a playoff now when Lindsey was involved in two on ones or for cereal you knew we were going to get a goal on it but more often than not it would be like scurlin would be in there on the two on one and you know that Brian is nice of a guy's he may be he couldn't score into an empty net from three inches away so that was always a problem with us in fact I remember the three on one we had against Pittsburgh and thank God it was scurlin was like behind a play and it was failure and my cuff remember that goal against Brad so the beautiful goal and thank God it was failure and air was slid the perfect pass across and my cuff stuck it in air in the scurlin was behind a play thank goodness for that that was in game seven uh second goal against seven right and uh you know well that's why scurlin plays the checking line a lot more than than the scoring line yeah I mean you know he is a better defender because he's slow and he's clogged up to these clogging up to these on the way a clogging it yeah and that's what Thorac and uh and uh uh the Strocco City likes to play with the checks well I think there you go and that tells you something about him so anyway uh don't that not sucking around for anything uh plenty of videos at home but uh uh and up to the north videos just you know no problem all right but I'd need a great act I can't wait until a hockey season where we got two months to go before the camps start no I need a good uh detox I need a good airing out and then I'll be ready to go again okay but I can't wait uh you know it's been it just seems uh week we can have scorn by and since uh our our our famous when uh lost yet we still won uh I'd like to point something out to all these uh new hockey fans in town when I was in Toronto over the weekend the Toronto sun which is really good news paper has a good sports section they had all kinds of articles about the Leafs Leafs traded Todd Gilda San Jose for Jamie Baker and there's a lot of speculation about the new coach they had all kinds of stories even though it's not the season you know what I'm saying and yet you come back down here where we just had all of this hoopla on all of the excitement we're in a stand-in cup finals and Monday and again today I mean here is not a word you can scour the sports sections of our local news papers there's barely a peep about the Panthers now everywhere this comes sent no uh the hair on the box he's post I mean they did there's thing but it's all over now you know you know you know you know you know you say I gotta get the hockey news but they you know that's that's what I do you know now I cannot only read about you know the Panthers but I can't I can read more about hockey I mean for Christ they could really problem with the hockey news I do like it except for the fact that by the time you get it in the mail it's a little moldy you know it's a little outdated but it's still good stuff I'm still thinking you know you it and it all we would really hear about if we're lucky enough would be the Panthers I mean if we if we play on our hands and knees and get down and you know do the rosary thing as well we might hear something about the Panthers we're definitely going to hear nothing about any of the other hockey teams in the NHL so you know it you're right it is it is a little old by the time you get it but it's not too too outdated at least you can get some good information about all the hockey teams so you know I like to get on my hands on the Anthony I mean Anthony's a break okay and hope that I get a paper you know a little blow up in the paper about the Panthers Center later okay yeah great job lovey baby very hard we have an open line city want to get on his hands and knees any takers out there he said he likes Peter North so we can't be all bad we have an open line on the green line course I like Peter North and look at me if you have a strong stomach 1249 at WIOD news talking entertainment radio news talking

line six let's get rid of these I'm so sorry as they say in Canada I'm so sorry that you uh open up that box and finalists because now it degenerates as opposed to the brilliant show we had going before we started doing this which was nothing which consisted of my sitting here as usual in begging and cleaning for some kind of human response and emotion and I'm so also sorry for uh sorry for bringing up the melalum thing the second day in the row because we got about oh man they're all except for the thanks for calling Lydia leave her out okay because she's okay in our book even though she's uh but some of these other people over the age of 400 oh yeah remember honeyman news you remember uh no I don't I was born in 1942 okay I don't remember Tommy Heinrich and all those guys that were playing when I was like an infant I don't remember and I don't want to remember that and nobody wants to be reminded of the best you can do with melalina so this all this crap about baby boomers as much as I hate that term I guess we don't have though baby boomers down here huh we've either we got two groups of people we got a bunch of punk skinheads out there and we got people over the age of 100 not not very much in between and that a bunch of uh stone the druggies over there on south beach running around showing everybody how hot they used to look before they got all washed out and burned out at a very early age right right so anyways that's the last part of this hour because I'm gonna tell you it between the heat and here and between uh those 14 cheesecake and that 25 of pounds of fudge this morning let's get this crap settled it's a game let's play out with a double U I O D Miami Fort Robert A. News talking entertainment radio 610 W I O D the water to 2 hours you check that you you you okay I like crying L.C. Why did you buy okay you the oh okay what oh seven at W I O D and I'm telling you there's nothing like the athletes in the day baby they're the best they're nothing like these guys they're worth every single dime and if you believe that you belong behind bars too okay you're part of the problem I'll tell you that right now here's a mobile in Miami hello hi Neil yes sir listen I know a lot of people talk about it but um if if I'm in an argument with somebody and I've been under the end yeah right and I go and get a pistol in combat and it goes off twice yeah isn't that premeditated no why wouldn't it because you thought about what you were doing during the argument yeah but you didn't like amen atom and pull the trigger allegedly no but a ledge you get what's right so I think it's absolutely ridiculous that he got off the fact that he just it's gonna be able probably unless the uh appeals court overturns her ruling that he's just probably gonna walk away is insanity it is it's free I mean he got his day in a sunshine he got his uh trial and the jury went out they deliberated for seven hours which is a pretty good amount of time and it came back and he said guilty is charged and uh that's it and she said forget it it was a sense of waste in the time and the money to have the trial if she was gonna didn't she have that same conclusion to begin with well if she would have just you know it's thrown it out in the beginning uh it would it would it would look bad for you wham you know yeah for you wham right you like these guys you're like they need more problems well she's a graduate of uofem and uh he wants uh took a couple of textbooks out of and uh yeah I don't know if he read him or not but you know he was there too yeah he was there on the cover so uofem thing man just remember that most of our problems in this community can be traced right there to moral cables to the University of Miami don't ever forget it I won't and I think it's criminal that you didn't get any kind of recognition yeah at the arena for everything you've done for the people in this town well I'm sure that the same day channel for a sense of no over and says thanks for doing those freebie those are great uh clips every night I'm sure that'll be the same day I got a note from Dean Jordan well maybe once in a while you should tell him no you know channel for uh never again

deal where we're gonna have that north Dakota Montana Idaho they go for an expansion north Dakota here's a mobile in Oakland Park hello I knew yes I tuned in kind of late I need some clarification

of course I didn't stick by my guns I did not I actually did give a couple of tapes away to some of those free loaders in Palm Beach County who never ever call especially in Boca that's the thing that really gets me we have this gigantic in fact a little bird was tell me not too long ago they did to Palm Beach book we actually beat some of the competition up there during midday I don't want to mention a names but that's the rumor that I heard which I don't want to get into a big song to dance about but we haven't had a fair number of people up there they just have locked you on us to get in something for free if we have something for free they move their jaw and you pop it right in there here's a lady mobile in Miami hello hey Neil how's it going okay let me tell you something I've been trying get on just to talk about a steak place yeah yeah it's busy I couldn't get through and then once you said I gave up trying once you said yeah no more free tape I picked up my phone and I said yeah right through yeah right through yeah how do you like that I was wondering do you have a place called long long horn sickhouse that's what a Phil Spots use isn't it I think I heard Phil doing spots for that long horn steakhouse where is that I know there's one they just open one off on candle and about one five two of you was in H3 on candle yeah I know there's one north but I have no idea where north is on the south person okay but it's really good to stay over there you should try it okay well if we can find out where the other one is I might try it well if I find out I'll let you know I'll ask Mr Phil are you talking about that movie uh cable guy yeah I want to go see a last one because my mom doesn't like violent movies and she want to go see that movie or that's think that's what I heard I heard it really blows I mean I've seen the set detector I mean it's kind of funny because it's super funny I've even seen Peter and North movies that didn't blow as much as that when I hit them from what I heard yeah you are about that okay well thanks for the long horn all right have a great day hook them horns baby hook them horns now there's some real bright guys those Texas fans oh man hook them horns yeah man are there some dumb people in that state course there it's close to Louisiana seriously inch by inch Louisiana the people there they all points they don't have like uh I accused of zero they're like in a minus column and some of the minus infinity how's infinity doing by the way open line and what's station to the they buy it open line and date so what's the story on the long horn steakhouse fill is there one in Broward you know it's how he's just ignoring me like I'm asking him uh there's there's one in Kendall there's one in there's one on in coral springs and one in Davy in Davy yeah both on University all right you know if I go in there mentioned Phil Henry will it give me a free meal anyway I got a submarine sandwich here all right so Phil says they don't even give him a free meal he says now that he's uh on a way out they say oh that's been nice no and you but uh get out of here just keep doing the spots and dummy up here's Latter Hill hello Neil yes sir don't you agree I always love colors you start by saying don't you agree well I I love that I think that the David hints and the good old boys uh yeah oh yeah and the good old boys at the FA I yep I think our singling out value jet and I think that if for the the lack of their own self preservation I think that the lack of their own self preservation don't you agree yeah I just just try to follow you yeah no I'm just I think that there was four four seven days that you jet slogan now we love to dive in a chose well I think it's if you're gonna look at it at one company uh why not look at the rest of the airline company yeah I would agree with you you know I would agree because if they've been this lacks on value jet then who knows how many other airlines are cutting corners and the maintenance people are like maybe marginal it does they have to put the plane don't have gigantic cracks and big holes and things you know you start getting real nervous about the whole thing and if somebody who flies a lot myself uh I'm getting really disenchanted with some really crappy service and this business of on time I mean their idea of leaving on time I guess anywhere within three hours of the scheduling party part you know see part of the problem is you know as well as I do that when you when let's say you have a flight from here to Atlanta they schedule the flight from four lottery the other day and they show you that it's gonna take you two hours to get there right now you know as well as I do that on a decent day unless there's like horrendous weather it takes maximum and I mean maximum hour and 20 minutes of flying time to get from four lottery of the Atlanta and the reason that they schedule it for two hours is because they know damn well that you're never there's no chance in hell that you're gonna take off anywhere near on time so they're just giving themselves a cushion right I agree and they're full of cramp it's it's it's it's and especially when you're leaving from an airport like four lottery that's got you know that I mean there's no planes lined up there there's never more than like number two for take off because there's not a lot of traffic in and out of there and yet even this last time going from four lottery to Atlanta to Toronto the four lottery of like just leaving here was the nightmare and they changed the gates at the last minute well if you're going to Atlanta well guess what you're all going on this plane over here and everybody lines up but it it was chaos it was like something out of all of tallya although at least all of tallya in the year they know what they're doing well I'm just saying that the maintenance programs in general yeah they're designed to make money those policies at the FAM mandated were done in written 20 years ago was that great in order for them to make money they have got to offer all these planes in a certain period of time and now that the planes are 20 25 years older yeah they've got to do the same situation that they did when the planes were newer now and I just think that just common sense is going to show you that value jet united American it doesn't matter if they're small or in a country no I don't agree with that I think you're getting a little carried away now you're thinking you think that they have certain other that united in the other companies have have higher standards than a value jet we're working absolutely yes I don't I don't agree I think that they're all the same you think they're all just a shlock is the kind of corner cutting they were doing right now you know I think Jordan the president of value jet I think he's full of craft you think yes yes okay now what are you saying that these these airlines that are first of all how many times have you heard about you know airlines have an all kinds of illegal cargo on board like those hundred ninety oxygen canisters on cap that just happened to wind up on a plane you happen to get caught you know I don't maybe I'm I'm being paranoid but I just think that this situation and that hasn't been proven yet yeah well you know what my mother said if I keep going all these vacations I'm going to wind up in the Everglades maybe she's got a point oh no yeah I hope we're not maybe I can become a geeter lover but have a great day pal okay open line in dates so there's a guy who's really going to make you know it feels encouraging I'm going to say it again I'm sick and tired of these airlines lying through their teeth I don't expect miracles man and first of all they don't even know how to board a plane anymore you don't understand if it was up to me I'd start putting up a little bit and say hey everybody who's not if your row hasn't been called set the hell down now and shut up and then they give you like a first class and a daddy and whatever you can get on now and all and all the cripples and whatever and because what they ordinarily do they say well if you need some extra time or you're traveling with small children and then half of the plane gets on there we're talking about people are like half my age where healthy is a horse but all of a sudden they need extra time and then of course what they do is they take a ball of space in the overhead bins and you go back when you're always being called you go in there and you find that all these people are sitting in front of you like and which has an event called yet people are like 20 years old but they need extra time so they could stick their guitar in their drugs and crap all in the overhead and jam it all up in there who the hell are they kidding but hey it's just the chaos it's just absolutely organized chaos like I said the public just a bunch of pussy's man we just sit back and we take it because that we don't have any choice and once the last time you flew out of plane that had a few empty seats huh you notice how that's gone the way of the wind and if you're scheduled to depart somewhere especially if you got to stop to make forget about making your connection because now if there's four empty seats on a plane they wait and they wait and they they start searching the airport for standby even people didn't want to go where you're going hey listen we got some empty seats over here how about it even if you don't have a ticket we'll stick you on there makes it look good and you sit there and wait and all of a sudden they open the doors up again that's my favorite when they open the doors up again as they didn't at land after we sat there on a raft for god only knows how long the other day they open the doors again and then you look outside the window and you see that they're putting more luggage on yeah they just brought up it's it's time to depart man it's time to start and they make the announcement oh yeah we're ready for immediate departure as soon as everybody's got their ass to see we can start pushing back from the gate right and you look down and all of a sudden there's about three assholes down there who are like talking to each other in high five and picking their nose and they're sticking more luggage on there like yeah we're really going to take off now with a luggage compartment wide open uh they love to lie in a chose man 125 a Wiod let me tell you about a place where they don't lie they don't give you any skins where they get in fact this is quite a contrast to the kind of stuff we're talking about dry concepts one of the reasons they've been successful is because they give you a great deal it give you a written guaranteed price up front they give you a nice little rose when they're all done with the job and then in between they do a super fantastic professional job each and every time they make your carpets you're a poultry you're drapery whatever it is that schmutzie right now they make it look brand new and the reason that they're carpet cleaning is so great is because they use their exclusive dry cleaning method just like the one that's used to dry clean your clothes they suck out the deep down dirt and like I said make it look like a miracle on your floor they make your carpets look brand new so no matter how desperate it may be don't give up don't try to wait don't go out there waste a lot of money on new carpeting when you go get a rake job from dry concepts in date call 93036369303636 in braward call 58814739 58814739 and West Palm Beach 9304739 9304739 when you call say we understand that even kneels mother is happy with the job you've done if a quetched like her is you must be phenomenal dry concepts use talk at entertainment radio 16 W I O D so anyway 127 will be nice if somebody would let me know so I don't want to go to the wrong place but that would be a good excuse so for me I'm not showing up tomorrow we have an open line in date 7509463751 goiam and we have one on the green line 1 800 9449463 I'll tell you one thing about cox enterprises man they got the best legal firm that can keep a meter running like you never saw they can take like a two minute case and drag it out for 20 years even the let him go judge up they're never saw nothing like this here's my me beach hello good afternoon Neil yes sir just a few observations if I may about value jet the day of the crash the secretary transportation for the recoil pinna pin you yes and the head of the FAA David Hinson both spoke on television right I remember it very well and assured the american people that that you jet airline was as safe as any other airline flying at the moment or maybe my mother's right now would you say possibly that at that particular point in time so the line through the teeth and untruth just maybe then about to recover their own asses what they were doing then of course all these newspaper started leaking these reports yes from February especially in like earlier before that about how value did have been cutting corners getting all these warnings from the FAA and that they were basically operating like kind of a shlock operation yes yeah and then two weeks later the pedicons which used to use value jet said at that point in time they would discontinuing their usage of value jet uh now after a month and a half or so goes by they decide to shut the airline down I don't think that they should pick on some undrolling and punish him I think that they ought to call in the secretary transportation as well as ahead of the FAA right onto the cockpit as long as we can keep politics out of this which of course we can't right and have both of these men resign for the good of the country either better for some defy value jet you raise a good point yeah thank you very much okay and maybe have Jessica is the pilot just proper up in here that's okay what difference is it making this point we have an open line in dates you this whole business and like I said that thing would have in a seven year old girl flying a plane we had all those so-called experts going in here that they say oh yeah there's nothing dangerous about that and she's not really flying while you're right about that she ain't flying no more because they had to make the deadline you know they had to get on there for the cameras were rolling and they had to make a big celebrity had to get in the Guinness Booker records even though they don't take the record anymore and they had to make it on the CBS evening news and oh it's speaking of CBS man so help me God Joseph and Solomon that morning show what they've done to that show I think that's the last blow right there I think that after Joe Dodgeola became the replaced male Allen with the Yankees I think that the next the last straw the last nail in the American public's coffin was replacing Harry Smith and Paulazon on CBS there's more even though nobody watched it and even though we did have Mark McHughan on there ever see Mark McHughan and Cecil Fielder together by the way here's Boca on a purple line hello Neil I was going same as okay I didn't happen here that still Henry Cole from the sports station in Charlotte now they're I gotta say something there could have been the dumbest man on the face of the earth feel I mean the Boca Bell money just sucked that guy in how could anybody be that stupid you know that what happens we sucked him in they call in the handy and and he puts the calls right through is that that stuff goes there looking for mandates for somebody exactly what a great thing that I don't believeable he had that guy he didn't know whether he'd scream or each of you didn't crack an outfit and just a little bit about Phil Henry I think he's getting a screwing like the ones ever gotten before and while you just look back over the history of this whole thing in a brand Cox lawsuit and all of this stuff you know he's gonna roll and all this other and you're looking like a guy who's been made into a human sacrifice basically which is a tragedy well I just want to say to Phil Henry's god and keep it up okay so yeah purple line is open pound io d and then of course somebody comes in here only moments ago during the news break it has given me all kinds of instructions about this deposition and don't go over here go over there and do this and the read this it's gotten to be ridiculous you know all this garbage that's going on here let's just give the guy some money and cut the crap and let's move on with our lives or give me the money here's my amy hello yes ma'am okay i was just calling to say that it's being rude with the crime you would be doing a lifetime sentence thank you oh and she's gonna hang up which is very polite of course if being rude was of course you know what that's all about don't you there's a black lady calling that's right i'm erases now because i have the audacity to say that Brian blade should have gone to jail and that's a verdict to show the stood and that it's a grotesque injustice which most most people agree with that but if being rude were a crime i'd be doing a time and sonny you sound like slime nice ride we are nice ride well it is evident that she ain't never gonna be president but i hope she brushes with pepso dan one thirty two a

i'll read the urge open line in brown five two four nine four six three that was back in the days when we had an audience that was almost alive but now we get a bunch of you know like this bitch that

people waving a gun and having an oops it just went off i didn't kill nobody yet how about you sweetheart but that's a real good cover up that's that's really clever that's a good piece of off-escaption there you know what that means off-escaption as in radio station as in mass nation as in masturbation got it put it all together good law 34 wild when default goes on vacation sports

here as he continues flabbergasting and exasperating people from coast to coast including very naive punks from Charlotte North Carolina what do you expect from somebody from North Carolina here's uh boka hello hey Neil yes sir how's it going okay i heard you want to reconcile yesterday talking about uh your various uh diabetic supplies there what kind of meter do you use aims aims are as glue cometer i figured since you were you know you're always top of the line and getting all the good stuff why don't you switch to some more modern like the a leader the uh one touch or something like that there's a so much easier to use why's that you don't have to prick your finger well you do have to prick your finger but you know you don't have to bother with a wipe in in the time and you just stick the blood on there slap it in and- well i've tried some of those other ones i don't like this one now works the best for me it's a piece of cake i figured that not so my wife was listening to you she works at a at a all leave it on name but a diabetic uh type placed in pompino and uh she was going crazy what the fact that you reused your uh land set yeah over and over she says that uh very bad and you know she's been diabetic since uh what do you mean that's very bad for what well she says it's she thinks she's using new one every time and you're just uh and i'm maybe it's probably just because she's in the healthcare profession you know she's using new one every time for what purpose like him gonna give myself blood poisoning or something oh i don't know i guess uh it gets various airborne sort of pathogens can get themselves onto the needle after you use them before you cover them back up again oh come on she's getting carried away now oh she was worried about you so i'll be okay i'll be right right now uh in closing now i just want to take a request something yeah uh get so cop okay all right see up sure okay let's go to a Miami hello hey nail are you doing okay listen uh you know you have these baseball teams and hockey teams and football teams they fly all over the place okay we didn't we never hear about them crash uh seems to me that there was some minor league hockey team in Canada uh couple years ago though huh is there was a major years ago that was a couple years ago but that's just a minor league team of these guys and i remember some uh i think either high school or college basketball team in the midwest somewhere that doesn't have a crash never hear of any problems with the major leagues uh with all the flights they take uh i just wanted to do some kind of double standard going on well what does that mean i mean how many flights are there every day how many planes crash in relationship to the number of flights there are every day in the first place well i mean just you know problems with motors you know tires you just never if you never hear anything yeah i don't know it seems to me that i recall one of the Panther planes coming back the a private jet i remember rumor tell me that they went off the runaway in Fort Lauderdale and it was uh kind of a uh scared and nasty deal during the season like an aborted take uh for something no no unlanding oh i just i just i just never seemed to hear anything about all but i know that they you know there's jet around well maybe lord works in mysterious ways you never know maybe he's uh got a bet on a game i don't know you still got any dirty movies left no we don't have dirty movies anyways sir better clean up your act we have an open line we have clean adult video believe me real clean they wash them off seven five and the movies two seven five one nine four six three seven five one wildi so i guess i better start cleaning the speaking that cleaning off those little bricks that you use on your aims uh with in conjunction with your glue commander to prick your finger because of this guy's wife this uh two calls ago she's very concerned and says you're gonna well what are what are you gonna do to yourself i mean to think that you're gonna change that every time oh my god give yourself eight yeah that's it i never thought about that by the way it's raining like a uh it's raining like the end of the world out there now isn't that great so i guess when i put in the water in the back of my car huh well isn't that a bitch huh no i don't got no umbrella this is getting pretty old i'll tell you that right now right now let's do something about this okay i mean uh i know this makes for a lot of excitement for Brian star cross no those guys oh yeah the tropical wave and the tropical storm we got the first one and they uh oh geez they just can't wait for this crap get everybody hysterical here's tamarac hello well neo what y'all do the little uh alcohol swat that you swap your finger with before you prick it i don't wipe off i don't do that all right well they're I was just trying to give you a tip well let me ask you why do you need to do that well i think what i mean of course it's gonna be very insignificant possibility but you know you never know you might get some germ that's on your skin that's not supposed to be below your skin yeah and that might you know you might inject that into you but i like i said that's uh that's pretty far fed so i'm not raining with y'all i'm a green one like something that howard hues would have done back in those days you know before he went nuts all together right now my farm is so i figure i i got a little bit about that yeah but the thing i was caught up about those two things when you touch that i was talking about that people with the bags in the overhead compartment i'm a freaking travel frequent traveler should say they uh they say oh you got to have this certain size bag i've seen people load carpool stuff oh yeah people come on their carrying slupping all kinds of stuff and then of course they generally tend to be the first handful of people on the plane and so you've got 150 to 200 people standing behind them just getting exasperated and dancing from one toe to the other waiting for them to put their crap in there and a lot of these people man it's like they're in their own world it's like they're like the drivers down here there's nobody else behind me don't confuse me i'm gonna take my own sweet time stick my fat ass out here in the middle of the island if nobody can get by two stick it bad and the plane is half hour late taken off because of me two bad right i can't think of the number time that i've gotten on the plane got where my seat is open up the overhead compartment and said god isn't already space on this plane yeah but the other thing you know what i mean the brides blade decision doesn't surprise me a bit i mean one it like two minutes after they announced the guilty verdict and out the judges calling everybody into the thing on monday i mean if that was a horse race we'd say that was fixed yeah there you go i mean they picked a dumb jury but i guess they just weren't dumb enough i think the judge said well i'll let it go to the jury they'll give me the decision that i think we want and then when they came back with the wrong one she said well wait man we got i've got to meet again on monday and even the people from court TV were saying well i think she's gonna reverse this well i always do there weren't too many real loyal u m football fans but i guess we found one anyway okay all right we're locked to us bye bye okay there we go everybody's concerned about my uh sticking my finger with those little pricks for the uh look you know and the company yesterday and did that and i really am not sure why the hell i did that other than do a freak out Rick Riley which i did brick and suds both are like oh they're turning their heads and what what is wrong with people when you've done that thousands of times and you've taken little blood drops and you've done the thing with your blood sugar it's it's uh insignificant i mean how about people that have to take insulin for example that have to like take a needle and the shoot themselves up every day how about that i bet a girlfriend and i would uh inject her oh man i'll back to me that's not too crazy about that but just a little pin prick like that and get in the drop of blood and stick it on the uh uh thing there and wipe it it off with a schmata what's a big deal with that and these guys here's a couple of adults here's a couple of macho adults who are sitting there practically in tears like a couple of real pussies and i wet my pants here's highland beach hello hi Neil yes sir yeah i have a spare port for you from Boston yeah um word isn't Boston that brimaclane are brimary and dugmaclane are interested in caminealy this he says caminealy says he's getting healthy and that's the pants he's interested in coming to Miami great for the pants are great i wasn't sure where you would stand on that because you know he's often injured or whatever that's okay we'll take him right now no questions asked he says he's doing his rehab everything's going great and that's just the report coming from up there and in exchange for caminealy what they want is um possibly a draft pick and one of the players and that's yet to be named they haven't named it yet but one of the players um did they they they're not even talking about rumors as far as the players concerned i am just curious to wonder who it would possibly be well i'm sure i'll be the first one to find out in the rumor line you know how that goes yeah but um i knew i figured you'd be interested in that okay um but yeah they you would bring definitely a light for the next season as far as another goldscore get him and with him between him and shepherd and you know they could definitely get things done out there sounds good to me but i can i call someone to do spare yeah all right bob and Jimmy at lime you are both two big fat boy douchebag okay all right okay i'll put you up get out of here we have an open line in brower five two four nine four six three it's eleven forty seven a w i o d just talking entertainment radio six ten w i o d a kill the cold in the past african americans were

change the divide huh it doesn't change the uh the atmosphere uh not at all i was acquitted the bit this is kind of the adult playground you know and uh it seems like every new hotel is you know like uh the magic piss and the capital of that and all that i don't agree with that i mean you got treasure island you got the amusement park inside of uh mgm yeah well that's the best and unless you go to the amusement park part of it you don't see kids running around really okay great well that's where we hope to lose our kids for a week and then find them on the way to the airport with back at

right from rooms or the service for this is hotel it's got like 5,000 rooms and still somehow in 25 minutes they bring your meal the food is spectacular and i mean it's expensive but it's great but every experience and tough for the people on the phone has been nothing but uh in correct terrific yep got nothing good reports i guess the only thing that i've heard from some people is that it's so big that it's uh it's kind of well you can I will take a compass along but other minutes okay look at you student great thanks a lot now take a great time okay there you go it is a smart guy like i

course we all got to come back here's my any hello Neil how are you doing okay listen if they have i want to tell that douche fry that called a few calls ago if they gave a sentence for being a dumb bitch you would be on the other side of the electric switch or about 25,000 volts oh the only thing that should be thrown out should be judge libo her stupa husband that dumb bitch brine blades and drosen house about 25 stories what do you think yeah that sounds good to me as Andrew should be first he could be a terrible one well he's a slime bullet or what yeah i can't get uh every time i see him i just want to cringe when i see this guy's uh like when this episode first happened you remember he said well he doesn't have time to bother with this and with this incident he's got uh football career you know he's got to go about there and play football or an elephant right they dictated who they were going to talk to when they were going to talk to him and how they were going to talk to him that's right and we're going to run to this when it's convenient for us right i hope to hinge i know you're in that just suit your somewhere please have Brian blades on today because one of the most historical calls i've had is that he's had on this show was when he had what gets one of the role because they called up i don't know if you remember yes i do i do remember oh that wasn't that a classic yeah only feel could put that in perspective but i'm sorry to add on with that with the other people i would have walked to bring other material to the table but this drives me nuts listen to this injustice that goes on here and of course all around the country but this drives me crazy today now i don't know about you but uh i don't know what they could do i thought blossom was the ugly specimen on the face of the circle i saw that it's judge label on the tube okay have a good day have a great life yeah i think at least blossoms got Vinnie anyway you know by the way were i gonna get a copy of that movie is that on video yet great white white squaw wha what white squaw i thought it was called great white that's a different one great white height no great white hype i know that's it's called white squaw the sailing movie yeah yeah which is a true story and where they're all running around the naked the whole movie and Vinnie whoever that kid what's his name again David Lusher oh boy you must have that written down don't tell me you remember that yes no way David Lusher you remember that god here's the west palm beach where is it hello yes sir let me tell you i'd like to talk to you for second about oldies about oldies oldies oldies oldies stations and palm beach i thought i tune in the oldies station in Miami they play runner run through an unseen melody all the time and then i turned into your show and i heard helpless by Kim West and i just wanted to know i wish i'll still had that you are the man yeah because you know all these more than these so called all these stations no oldies now they just play like one or two deep into every artist you know they play the same one or two songs you never hear like the third to fourth to fifth hit into the innuance and and he just play the same crap yeah for Mickey's monkey by the miracle and the crossfire by the war wants a effort for helpless by Kim West and they said who are on magic on magic well that's where i got to tape from sunny fox who of course don't listen anymore so he says even we lost all that way and the atkins thanks to me but nevertheless he's playing hard to get so i can't get another copy of helpless we don't have a sense you would see the other because i'm alright i just want you to know you demand because you got the ball to play this stuff when they say they play but you demand okay pal back to you that's right we're starting play oldies tomorrow we got new floor mad coming up and i love these people are called here or they send me facts and say oh yeah we love your show all your taste in music sucks my taste in music is almost as great as my taste in men okay i mean fence sensational i mean i'm telling you what i tell you something is good believe me it's good something you can really sink your teeth into here's crossprings hello hello no yes sir wow it's been a year since i've been able to talk yeah why's that i've been up in New York i've been in buffalo yeah well that's that's uh fate worth a death hi i agree with you 100 percent i uh reason i'm calling that though you might appreciate today i just got home i pull into my parking lot and right where i park in my car is three cops hiding in the bushes radar and people as they go down or i'll probably all apart uh over and they got a little system gone watching them now they got one hiding in the bushes i opened the window there's motor cycle cops and they make a hell of a racker when they take off but they get one and he points like your calling uh a guy up the bench he points to one of the guys on the motor cycle and they go and get them right and then you know then they rotate it yeah but they're hiding right how many rotate on this they're hiding right in my bushes here and you're on your property well in front of my apartment complex oh right in the bushes there's nice isn't that great porkers in bushes so if you're coming down royal pond between crow region crow springs they're right there watch for the poke and i agree with you on the food and vagus it's excellent it really is and uh when you can go to a hotel because i've been at hotels uh all over the country and uh generally speaking and even uh in europe some of the places the food ain't all i great the some of the better hotels it's pretty good but finding great food in a hotel is almost unheard of but the mgm grant i don't know how they do it but it's sensational it's a safe time it's inexpensive a lot of the food well if you want to go to the cheaper phase you know there's different kinds of people to go to vagus there's people to want to you know just put a bunch of sloppy near mouth for five bucks at the buffet which is okay and then people have got some good taste and want to eat a great meal i had i had some decent steak dinners there was inexpensive that was but i agree with you the food in the hotels is just superior it's a fact on only other food i was in Hawaii okay thank you amen i go along with that fact roots christ star didn't Hawaii so any well but about that free steak we were talking about if you're refrigerator talks to lame fill Henry w i o d you my m e ford lover day he was talking and her taking the video 16 w i o d
