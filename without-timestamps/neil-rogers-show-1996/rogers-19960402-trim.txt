Well tonight and look to the west, you will see clearly Uranus. Really? Yeah. Good. He knows. I'm Jennifer Ram, news talk and entertainment radio 610 W. IOD. This is the show of La Magnana, with new rehearse. This is the Zouserrebro. Do you want to go to us? This is the Zouserrebro. This is the Zouserrebro. This is the Zouserrebro. This is the Zouserrebro. This is the Zouserrebro. It's the part of the Zouserrebro. It's the usual delays. It's Russia. We've got a few collisions. One at 27. Another one at 47. Could be Northbound. I don't know. We can see nothing from this room. We're going to be in the car. And I'm not talking about my ass. That's your ass. Bye. Don't shoot me out of this guy. From your traffic. Okay Steve, how was that? Do you think I could have a job? Please. I got a great ass. There are a lot of people in the med-tax for the news that are generated. Our players live in Broward County. Good job, Bill. Good job, Bill. Broward County. We've never had a practice at the Miami Arena. We don't have any business dealings there other than the night's we play our games. Our entire future, all of the planning for this franchise from day one, has been towards an eventual building here in Broward to make it our home. Now, the Broward Commission can do one of three things. They can say, okay, let's go forward with it right now. They can say, okay, let's don't go forward. Or they can put it on the table and discuss it later. Whatever they decide, we'll have it for you later. Coming up. Okay, thanks. That's a good buddy. I see him in there. They're still holding their meat. So anyway, getting back to the guy that Oshan provoked toward the court of the end of the hour. That's exactly exactly. Greg Fadeck was just telling me that he and Jolie record the announcements for the Jolie or whatever state and put it off in games. Once it's played as you're walking into the stadium. And he heard those voices. That's Fadeck and Jolie. She does this, but he will. He does in place. And of course, it also made me stop and take pause and think about the saw grass that when you do walk in like the white elephant or the yellow seahorse or the purple dinosaur or the green rector source entrance that. What do you laugh at about. That they have all those recordings in multiple languages. Exactly. Exactly. But I still think the guy had a good point. What do we need to program an espioniel for okay? We're going to like having Chinese now too pretty soon. You'll have a program that'll wait like 50 pounds. That got at least a spik's right at short. It's short. Believe me. Have seen him. So anyway, here's a mobile and curl springs. Hello. Yes, sir. We did a double header. Yes. We went to the mallins and the Panthers. Great. Good for you. Here's a local athletic supporter. Let's talk about the mallins game for a second. First of all, the people have no clue at all. Listen to this. You can't. First of all, they only had one gate open to let you in. Oh nice. Why? The escalated don't work. It's broken. I think if they can just cover up another 20,000 seats though, or 30,000 seats with some schmattas, I think it's going to look sold out every game this year though. Uncle me, they said it was a sellout. Dude, you could roll the bubble up. Yeah, there was a lot. I saw it on TV. There was a lot of empty seats. Yeah. So then check this out. You catch a foul. Brow me a bag of charcoal. Oh. Yeah. Unbelievable. That's the real look. Of course. So we left there at the bat 620. We went over to the Panthers. That's where your real fans are. All right. Nobody gets up in between points. People can see it. The amount of games. They're more capable to get sessions. And that'll watch in the game. Yeah. The Panthe game was awesome. The second pair was outrageous. The Strock is God. Right. And Ray Shepherd. You know, I started to say this earlier on. I got sidetracked. I sidetracked myself. Can you imagine where we would be now if if Brian Murray wouldn't have acquired Ray Shepherd and Marty Strocker. Can you imagine where we would be right now? Oh my God. You know, how about that fight? In the stands. No. You want that one too. I saw you watching it. I was across from you. But how about the fight in the second pair? It's when the. So you got punched pretty good. Oh, God Daniels. Oh, you mean when Daniels beat the crap out of a Paul laws? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Paul laws man. That was the quickest fight in the history. That was like a 20 second knockout. Yeah. You've got to 10 minutes. Right. I mean, I'm totally got into it this year. I want to my first game last year with that. Well, that's where it's at. That's what it's all about. I'm trying to explain to these red next down here. Hockey's the greatest sport in the world. And if they don't understand that man. They don't know what life is all about. There's nothing even close. There's nothing even close to it. Anybody that hasn't been, you know, something. Neil. It was more exciting to see Chuck Clingball. What out there? Then watch the mall again. By the way, don't you love seeing those linemen go out there like in cities. And of course he had shorts on and this guy, I mean, I'm with all the respect to the dolphins in any other place. They delineman and football are such a bunch of slabs. They're so out of shape. They look like, oh, John McSherry on a bad day. Yeah. What happened if Clingball flipped on the ice and he was out to the season? Yeah. And of course he probably would have cracked the damn ice too. They would have been the end of the game. We love you Neil. We love hockey. Please keep a team here. And the big Hashi. Hashi your douchebag. Okay. See ya. Open on a bar. God, we still have had nobody asked for free tickets yet. Thank God. Oh, let's milk this for all we can. Please I'm begging you. We have an open line of brow. It's so what do you think? To speak or not to speak? That's the question. I'm looking at the lineup. But I'm going to tell you something. If you really want to get those holios in there this year, you're off to a bad start. We used to have Veneto. We had, uh, who else did we have? Who is that right? Fielder? Uh, what tell us his name? Honier. Honier Felix. Get the honey. Honier. He sucked. Anyway, so I'm looking at our opening day lineup yesterday. We got the Killvio Varus leading off at second base. That's good. That's a real good holio name. Killvio, baby. We love you. And then you got to you got divine white. He's as black as the day is long. You got the Gary Sheffield looks pretty dark to me. You got Jeff Konaen who's very pasty and white in a great player. You got Terry Pendlin who looks pretty dark to me. Last time I checked him out. You got, uh, Colburner at first base. He looks awfully white and light-complexed to the me. You got, uh, Charles Johnson, CJ behind her plate. He looks fairly dark and collected last time I checked. No, it's big of a spawning. You got Kurt Abbott who's kind of like a, uh, like a redneck. He's a good guy, short stop. You got Kevin Brown. I thought pitch pretty damn good yesterday. He was a starter yesterday for those that don't care about baseball, which I don't know the moment. But I thought he pitch pretty damn good. In fact, he did pitch pretty well. Seven innings six hits and only one run. And then, of course, New Yorkers Perez came in. He was the other holio in the lineup. And basically, they're went to game with three more runs, which, uh, you know, but Brown gets the loss because we never had a chance. And it gets the loss because we never scored any. But anyway, so New Yorkers Perez, who was the first relief pitcher. And stuck to join out. And then Matthew's or Salac and whether there's none of whom sounds too Hispanic to me. So we only had two specs in the whole lineup yesterday, which is various and New Yorkers Perez. That's no way to win over the holios. Just because you got a bunch of holios talked there in the program. That's not going to do it. We need to hold your Felix back. We need Benito San Diago. They used to love saying Benito, but he told you're Ferdito, but he told you know, they loved it. We need to have a hell of a whole bunch of holios out there. If you're really going to win these guys over, okay? Take it from me. I don't how to do it. Trust me. Okay. Let me say. In fact, we'll get a bunch of real good looking young holios in there. Okay. We'll get some real good guys. They may not be able to play too good, but they'll look good. They'll get everybody out there. They'll be screaming. They'll be moist. They'll be emotional. They won't have like a real, you know, like yesterday. They had about 40,000 people out there. That's okay. And like I said, if we just get some real big tarps and like, uh, you know, if we can cover up 90% of the seats and make the seating capacity. 7 or 8,000, we can sell out every game this year, which I think it could be a record. 1213 at WIOD. Guess who else was it? The game last night. Mike from A Atlantic Coast mortgage. That's right. Good guys over there. See these are just regular guys. They're hockey fans. That's another reason I like them. Not only they treat our people well, which includes you, but there's a guy that's a hockey fan. He comes to all the games. He stops by. He says, hi. What a great game. This was after the second period when it was a great game. And, uh, you know, these are the kind of people you want to do business with. Just regular Joe's like from off the street who want to help you get some money.

Well they're not buying. They're just kind of sponsoring it. I see. We need to sponsor something here at Cox Boyaz. Hmm. Come on. Washington Monument. I doubt if our listeners would appreciate it though. Till the holidays season, go yeah, then we hang those Christmas balls on it. Rick and Sir, six to 10 AM on the use, talking to entertainment radio, and the 610-WI-OD. Not only is Hank Goldberg, but also is a football team. Hmm. Hello. Hello. I was calling about the Wabbit you have for sale in the paper. Okay. What kind of Wabbit are they? Okay. I have some, uh, laugh. Yeah. And I have some laugh. And the party laughs and some sort of color laugh. Oh, wonderful. And I have a straightier dough and I have two balls. Two balls. A woodwood wall? They're small, ready. Oh, okay. We have a farm. Uh-huh. And we like to play with the Wabbit on a farm. Uh, you wouldn't have to have any, uh, like little Wabbit handcuffs. Anyone? Do you know handcuffs for the Wabbit? Uh-huh. Yes. I don't know. I never heard of them. What kind of... Well, you, we used them when we hunt them on the farm. We like to hunt the Wabbits. And we take them and nail them to a twee-bada ears and then skin them alive. Uh-huh. They're one. Hello? And now, what? I think that's what you don't do at least, Redis, but I couldn't say you were ready. We have a little game we play, called, All Wabbits must die. No, sir, no, sir. No, sir. Uh, I wouldn't say you were ready. Uh, uh, for $50. I like to hunt the Wabbit. Well, that's okay. You go out in the wild and you aren't ready. The days aren't for peel. I like to put them in a little pin and then hunt them down, and most of the flea. Now, sir, I'm sorry. Then say you're ready. Sometimes we even spear them to the head with a wasty water. So they just had the micro-levelen's through their on channel 6. The Dutch had to get special dispensation because he went to UM. I think you should be able to have like up to six pounds of crack up to a six pound crack. Why not? You're allowed to rape and you ought to be able to rape at least 17 co-eds. And then like maybe five or 10 chicks off campus. And 20 or 30 pounds of grass and 40 or 50 pounds of blow. And 80 or 50,000 pounds of fish is in blowfish. And that's it. What about the hookers? Oh, no, hookers. Oh, yeah, hookers too. That's right. I forgot that. Okay. 20 years. See, that's okay. They don't mind the drugs. It's just a sex they get very uptight about in America. So you can do all the crack and all the blow you want as in blow this. But hey, I know, well, see, if you, well, okay. Let's go to, it all depends on where you're blowing and what you're blowing. That's the problem. That's what America's uptight about. Okay. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, hi. Yes, sir. Can you give me a tell Michael he can't carry his oozee too? Oh, no. No. No, just go to thank you. So you can drive in a zoos, though. Yeah. I don't know about that. I was going to thank you for turning me on the hockey this year. Yes, sir. I've been going to the game. I'm having a great time. Good thing you got to find it this year because of course this could be our last, which is a very ugly thought, but it's something that's certainly in the back of my mind. Yeah. Well, I'll drive to Broward if I have to. No, I'm talking about our last in South Florida. I'm not talking about our last in the... Oh, I hope not. I don't know. I just got my name on the list for the season tickets. I'm hoping that they stay down here. They better. I agree. And H Wayne better watch it or otherwise he's going to have to change the name of his team to the Gringo's set in the Marlin. Yeah. And have a nice day. We have an open line at day 71519-463-751 WI-D. So like I said, that Yorkis Perez came in there and this kid just stuck that joint out. But anyway, where we going, we're going to Lake Worth. Hello. Anyhow, are you in? First time caller, a little motivated. I used to live in Miami. And one thing I haven't heard brought up yet. I used to live in the Kendall area. A whole South Kendall. So did I. I used to live in Kendall. Yeah. For five years I lived in Kendall. Oh, I lived there from 1980s. It was okay. And I've been listening to you. It was congested. It went back and crime-infested. A lot of people there. Yeah. And it used to take me about an hour to get downtown. Because you had to take the Palmetto to 836. The too long is parking lots in the world. Yeah. It would be just as quick and easier to hop on the turnpike to go up to that sunrise location. That's right. That's what I would tell everybody. But they don't, yeah. They're sticking it to the people who live in Miami as well except for the six fans who live on Miami Beach. I mean, the closest population area to the proposed. What are the fans who live on the beach? What fans are there on the beach? Well, I should. They were about six of them. Yeah. You know, on Miami Beach. And by that time, and I most of them are so stone, they can make it across the river across the, whatever it is, anyway, the bay. That's not what they do with even brow or department. I don't know, yeah. It has to do with date County. Two years most of the population in date County is in the southwest. At least the people that seem to want to go to the games. Yeah. So why drive through all that hectic? That's where all the Jews are and West Kendall last time I checked they speak English. So is your hockey fan? Yeah. And you got one up here in Lake Worth? And basketball fans. I don't know what I'm doing in Lake Worth. And basketball fans too, don't forget that. And basketball fans too. And I think that Mickey Mouse is making a very big mistake. I mean, I really do for you. You don't understand it's part of that whole master planning. God for that big gigantic port project there. There we do it in a whole bay there for Mickey Erisons fun and profit. That's what it's all about. I'm sure they have billions of dollars that he's got already is not enough for him. I'm sure they have a lot of money. How much does he need? It's not bad enough. How much Wayne needs. How much does the Erison family need before they got enough we'd like to know? Well, how much do they have to choke off this town? And if anybody wonders how come we'll never get casino gambling here, all they got to do is look how useful those cruisers to know where are in those gambling ships. If we had casino gambling in casinos. Yeah, I forgot for that. God for that. This would definitely not a fan decision. There's no question about it. Yeah, do a business. What has to do with greed? That's the only thing it's got to do with his greed and self-interest crap. There's no question about it. I would love to pair those tickets by the way if I possibly could. Okay. How can you say it with that? Well, if you're too issue got a pair. Okay. Hang on. Okay. Line 8. Take care of our buddy there. Take care of our Jewish pizon. We're not giving out tickets to an ugly am I'll tell you that right now. So even if you're not Jewish you better lie about it and start speaking several words in the Irish and or Hebrew or your out. Hey, listen. Why the hell can't we start pulling this crap? Let's start putting the damn stuff in the Irish in the program. How would they like that, huh? As in, hey, Cox a hoist. That would be good right there on a front page. Whoever to hell in Marlins are playing today. We got a message for you. Cox a hoist. That's it. Think they got the message you're what? So anyway, pretty depressing about that John McSherry business and of course I continue trying to emphasize to you that fat is not where it's at. There are a lot of people who just don't want to get the message. They want to just keep you know, pouring that stuff in there, pouring it in, shoveling it in like this is the way it's supposed to be. Let me ask you this much. How in nature. How many animals do you see in nature who are fat? You ever stop and think about that? I'm talking about not talking about your pets that you're feeding the same crap that you're reading that you're killing by the way. I'm certainly not talking about that. I'm talking about like in the vile. How many animals do you see that are fat? I'll tell you. Oh, to be go. None. There are no fat animals in the wild. Because they eat whatever they want to eat and then they run around and do whatever they're doing. Do whoever they're doing or whatever they're doing that. They might their own business. That's it. I rest my goddamn case. Okay, are you getting the message now or what? Oh, boy, look at that. The weather's sure looking to hell of a lot better toward the weekend. I'll tell you that. Wow, wow, wow. Oh, oh, oh, man. Let's all hop on a plane and get out of this joint. Here's for a lot of nail on the purple line. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Happy poem. And back to you. Montevall. And all that good stuff. Uh huh. Listen. You're a good judge. I went to my first game last night. Yeah. It was pretty cool. I liked it. Yeah. It was unbelievable. Listen, we got through early and we were checking out. It was, uh, you know, because I had to say I'd never been there before. Let's check them out warm enough. And I'm sitting there and these little bastards are running around chasing this stupid blimp. Uh huh. What the hell is that all about? They need a lesson that they'll never forget. You know what I said? I took one of them. Good. And uh broken leg. I went by the way. I wonder what happened to the guy that got hit in the head with a puck that happened like that was right behind you. That was right in front of me about four rows in front of me. Oh honey. I saw him grab his face. Yeah. And then the kids his kids started screaming and crying at little kids there. And uh, and then the wife very calmly, like grabbed his jacket. Yeah. The last one the lead. I think he walked out with very calmly like, hey, I hope his skull is cracked open. Might knock some sense in him or something like that. But the kids were like psychotic. I mean, he just got hit in the head with a puck. You know what I mean? I was like, well, I was, I've never been so kind of lost but I wasn't. I was doing okay. And it was one of those things where I saw it coming. And of course, I'm not a pussy when it comes to the stuff like that. Okay. In fact, I remember once I was broadcasting you of him baseball on caught a ball that came into the Pressbox right between my knees. It came up over the top of the counter that we were working on. And I caught it right between my knees. It's called self preservation. That's what I was doing on channel 33 with Bob Greasy. And I caught it and believed me had never moved a half an inch. I caught it there firmly between my knees because if it would have continued moving along, my voice would be a lot higher now. Is it still there? No, it is not. But I only have one ball now. I didn't know the players know that. I'm kind of like watch. I'm going to know my name, but I don't know the numbers and who they are. I'm watching. And I seen him make that shot. And I guess it went off the other guy sticking it went airborne. Yeah. I see he just said stick to you know to say he's trying to throw some more yettition. They're just a stick. And but the kids chasing that blamp was driving me crazy. And that stupid watching the t-shirts many people are like animals. I know people are afraid people are like a carry on for free stuff man. Doesn't I make you want to bar people that are like a bunch of free loaders like that? If they're going to ask for something for your good something free, they should ask me. Oh, for tickets right? No, but I think it was pretty lame. The only thing I thought was like. Like I said, there's nothing more degrading and disgusting to me than people who gravel for free crap. Me, the only thing I thought was pretty cool with. Yeah, which was okay with the things with the kids and the bumper things. They were launching them during intermission on the ice. Oh, bye. You've seen that so many times. If you never saw it, I guess you find that a music. I don't know. But I've already been. I've never seen snow or ice. I was a first by one in there. Yeah. During a hockey game. But you're easily amused, I guess. Well, I'm kind of, but my first intermission. I went out to have a smoke. Yeah. Get it. Oh, man. It was like a cocktail party out there. Right. People were on top of people. I said, let me give you a piece of advice. If you got to take a leak, don't wait till in between periods to go there because it'll never happen. I don't know if you can. I didn't need to cigarette that bad. Right. Back in, I was like, this is ridiculous. Yeah. But yeah, can I check out again? I beg your pardon. Can I go check out the game? Can I get some tickets? To what? To the hockey game. Maruja Tautanoi. Sure. And Mohino Mela Hallum. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. Purple line take care of that free loader. Okay. He's knocking the other people because they want to t-shirts and he wants free tickets. Two of them out too. In fact, if you lose his name. So anyway, it's 12.29 at WIOD.

My black geese Jewish would you believe it? Jojorardy Andre Dawson too. Dr. San Jose Jewish could you conceive it? And Louis Salazar's a Jew. Ryan Sandberg's Jewish would you know it? He's a stranger on Walton Harry Carrey too. He's a man. As a matter of fact all the Chicago cops are Jewish since I fell in love with you actor Villain O'Wayman. I'm fell in love with you. Beautiful. So Ryan Sandberg's back Rhino is back. He's kind of embarrassed to come back but I guess he spent the other 40 million real fast and he needs some more money or something or he's just getting bored or maybe he developed a personality which I doubt. Ryan Sandberg's back. Nice to Jewish boy. And it comes one yesterday. I wonder if the not slanting lady saw that. She's probably pretty busy now. It's tax time. And she's still doing that on the side or she just doing the air conditioning. He's tired. Yeah, she works in the office for the air conditioning for the family. I don't know. So I think she does that she like moonlights or moon shines or whatever. With the attack thing. And she's definitely too busy to call us because it's like April 2. So anyway moving along. Here's the North Miami. Hello. Hey, I'm honey. How are you doing today? I have a question for you. I'm really happy. When they were planning the Miami arena about 10 years ago. How come they didn't plan like all the news there to the yard. I don't know. There's your amount of schmucks. That's why. Why wouldn't they think about it? There are a bunch of corole clear little schmucks. And that's just it. Because you deal with Miami politicians who don't know nothing about sky box from schlocks from rocks. They know nothing. All right. I just get interested in that. Ryan Cox. Yeah, my other quick question is, you could have grapes on before the playoffs start. Yeah, let's see. That's a couple of weeks away. Yeah, I guess so. We'll have mine a couple of weeks. You're doing your best shows right there. Yeah. When I give them a little education is to what the house goes on. He doesn't know what's going on. When he says too, that's the best. I love that. Okay. It's like around for the tickets. Sure. I guess so. Why don't you. Hang on. Line three. Take care of that guy on there. Who's that? Is that the not sliding lady? Yes. See, I knew she'd be on her immediately. I didn't want to embarrass you though. Well, you had to know I would call. You'd be busy doing tax stuff. Well, I am. Does you do a tax stuff? No, you're still doing that, but just like. Yes, men, lady. Right. Like I said, I finally got one right. That's good. So how's your weight coming if I may ask such a personal question? It's doing a wonderfully. Yeah. Yes, it is. You've lost a number, huh? Well, you don't have to give it to me. I don't know why you wouldn't want to give it. I don't want to know how much you weigh just how much you lost. 102. Oh, my god. Oh, wow. Yeah, I'm a different person. She's lost 102 pounds on the Atkins. How do you like that? Yes, I have. And not because she read about it in New Times either. That's right. My good buddy, Neil. That amazing 102 pounds. I know it is. It's completely amazing. All these people come around to your rena, and, you know, the hockey game. Mm-hmm. And one guy last night, I guess he said 44. And then there was another guy that's lost over 100 and somebody would 25. And it's amazing. It is my kid's school, all the people in the office are on it now. Really? Yes, they must have read new times. I don't think so. No. How about that? I've started the quietest revolution in the history. And look at this, they're showing the John McSherry thing again. What is wrong with you, people on Channel 6. Will you stop doing this already? Even my god. The man is dead. What a shame. Oh, 352 pounds, soaking wet. What a shame. It's been an out there in the heat. And one of the best on-pires of all time, too, is a great guy. I liked John McSherry was good. It was bad. Yes, he was. See what that fattledoodya. And now they follow that story up with mother Teresa. I think they're going from the sublime to the ridiculous. Jesus, we don't have to go to that extreme. Next, they'll have Wendy Bennett on there. That's right. No. But anyways, you lost 102. That's great. So you did watch the game yesterday? Is the Cubs game? Yeah. No, I just read the box, Gordon. I had to go and see what Mark did, of course. I was watching a Marlins and Mark races up at a basis. Look, because I heard that the Cubs went into extra innings in her game. So I flipped over to G and on a satellite immediately. And they were in the bottom of the tent, I guess it was. Right, bottom of the tent. So you got to see it. Bases are loaded with, I guess, one out. And here's Mark race up there. And he follows off a couple of tough pitches. And then slams it past their base. And Harry Screaming Cubs were. And that was it. That was great. Harry, by the way, sounds like, oh, he really. And he breathed. Well, I don't want to sit. Don't say that. Not up to you. Sounds really. Hey, Neil. Yeah. And he breath could be less. So right now, look pretty. I didn't. I don't know. I just, that's, you know, I turned it on just in, I guess I was the one that put him over the top because I turned it on just in time for him to get the winning hit. You and then race and chess scored the winning run. And evidently he had tied it up in the ninth with a two run homer. Right. So how do you like that? That's wonderful. But I can't. I don't care about the Cubs. I know you're still. You know what? You got to get me good seats for one of those games. Okay. And we'll go together. Uh, maybe I'll get you good tickets. I'll get your seats. Believe me. We got plenty of seats. Okay. And we were given away seats yesterday for opening day. That should tell you how much interest there is in this joint for the Mollons. Yeah. Hit the shame. I still got to find out who that kid was sitting in our seats at the hockey game last night. With his girlfriend. Maybe he'll be there again. Maybe he'll be there again. He was there once before. So he must be related to somebody that works here or somebody. Well, that's nice. He looks sweet as she had blonde here. He looked the head that's sweet as she looked like a good looking match. Sondine is a matter of fact. She didn't tell me those things. Yeah. You might weakness is. You would have been hyperventilating. You would have forgotten all about Holy Grace. I don't know this year. Mark Grace and I have to have like a little meeting. Oh, yeah. Now that you've now that you're shapeally in the. That's right. Yeah. You have to hold a meet. Yeah. Something like that. Okay. Take care. Thanks for calling in this day busy. Bye bye. Not slanting lady there. Check it in. As soon as she heard Mark Grace, he dropped all those tax forms right on the floor. So what if somebody does go to jail for two cares? She says it's a question of priorities. What's more important? And obviously it's Mark Grace. So did we find out yet who that kid was at the game last night or not? Had to be. Unless now they weren't sitting in because they've sat in there once before. They must be related to somebody that's here. I didn't you once tell me that somebody downstairs. Was it easier? He had a plantation high school ring on. So somebody who lives in plantation. Do we have anybody who works here that lives in plantation? It's got a son of a girl that did go because he's definitely not in high school no more. Thank God. Because that's a problem. But a lot of people we do. Besides me that lives in plantation. Oh, jeans. But I don't answer. Johnny dark. Jeans. Oh yeah. Must be related to Johnny dark. Yeah. That blonde hair just like Johnny. Yeah. He kind of reminded me of Johnny dark. Uh huh. Yeah. Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey. How you doing? Okay. There you are. Great. My midchery of the night. I'm going to give you a couple of denimons. Right. Right. Yeah. We were there again last night. Where did he get those by the way? I'm just a tobacco shop and a temper point. Oh, we don't want to promote them because Mike's a girl is a good all-site kind. Okay. So I don't know where it is. Okay. But got him there. And it was a better crowd than thought. Yeah. I was very pleased with John. He was a pretty skeptical. And they got there a little bit on the late side, which I didn't understand because of the baseball game, but 13,000 plus for hard foods, even without anything else going on. That's a good crowd. Yeah. I like to say that the Scrootland makes me warm every time he touches him. Oh, man. Uh. What are we going to do about him? He's. Maybe we'll just make him miss the bus and not go on his road trip. I hope so. He's the third. I mean, we got basically we're hanging on for dear life, and 15.3 seconds left in the game. And he gets another stupid penalty. And he gives it up every time. Oh, he just, uh, he gives me the willys. Big time. Yeah. He's just scary. And I just want to say a little bit of the show. And I am sucking up for a temp. I've got, we've gone to a bunch of games. And I'd like to do that one. Okay. You will. Okay. Can I say hi to Mike? Who's that? Boyfriend. Oh, you can say hi to Mike. Thanks for this. Okay. And hang on. Why'd five take care of that nice lady because your boyfriend gave me two cigars? That's what it takes. It's tipped for tat baby. You rub it a little out, rub it a little. We'll see what happens. It's grease and somebody's palm. That's what we're whole world is built on that kind of stuff. Okay. If you're going to be a free loader, then you're never going to get nothing. If you're going to like tip the guy, evaluate, park it a couple of extra bucks. You'll bet your car will be right out there. And I'll say yes, sir, Mr. Neil. Here's your car and I have a big smile on his face to say, oh, by the way, don't let anybody back into you again. Because Tony the nose is getting a little upset about that insurance. So anyway, I wonder if Tony the nose is going to have the concession to brand new arena and Broward if we get it built. So I get the feeling we're not going to hear anything today. Is that what we're going to go through this again? Day after day after day after day after day. We're going to be spending hours at the bowl. Not the orange bowl, but at the porcelain bowl, we're going to be spending hours with Bated breath on hands in these waiting to find out if we're going to get screwed over. If we're going to get our beautiful door renauer plongs right there in somewhere and Broward or if it's just, you know, how long can it drag on? You know what I'm saying? How long can you drag it before it starts bleeding? 1241 at WIOD. Tropical Chevrolet. They're not bleeding over there, but they do have a little mess on their hands. It's that construction business, which still goes on. Just like the construction on Biscayne Boulevard, which seems to be gone for last 500 years. Man, if they do plan to building that whole thing down there by centennial park. If they do that as fast as they're repaving by a Biscayne Boulevard by the year 2459 by the year 2525 Zagran Evans ought to be playing basketball on that thing. But anyway, it's a mess. Balls back. Basketball and hockey are winding down. So it's time to talk, dolphin football. D-Sode and Matt Doggan. Bocaber gets you ready for the NFL draft every night at 6 p.m. Sports, sports, 6-10. On news, talking entertainment, a radio, 610. W-I-O-D. They said it couldn't be done. All your ringer, ring night with a late great-grandl能 in the television event of the decade, the story of the fam four of the roles and thought, featuring two new Beatles saw and you saw it all on one television level. A Beatles, C, or the ratings were so good, we're going to do it again. A set of shouldn't be done. Very raw, morey, reunited with a late great-andy, and yet another television event of the decade, a story of the brothers, the B-G's, and thought that you only on A, B-G's, see, featuring known new songs, or which we can all be very thankful. Watch for the B-G's, and thought that you come in soon on A, B-G's C, and stay tuned for future television events of the decade on A, Bobby Schumann C, A, Box Car, really C, and A, but whole surface C. So let me ask you the B-G's, are they still living around here or what? They still have an iron star island with all those big shots, even Andy Gibb. He's hanging out over there. So anyway, it's 1246 in W-I-D. We haven't had any more word about the arena, as soon as we know, then we'll make something up in past it along. As soon as I see them, it comes flashing down there on Channel 6 again. I'll open up the thing. I just don't know. Here's Lauder Hill, hello. I'm in Bokan now. Like I said, here's Bokan. What's the owner on you? I got a first woman. Many people would say that's a big improvement, by the way. I didn't knock the people in Lauder Hill, but quite frankly, they've got a pretty marginal time. But anyway. It is. The, my vote is no for the, for the Espanol in the, in the Marlins manual there. You're game. I just don't think that's right. I had a question about this whole thing that's going on with your arena yesterday. No, article in the paper about the lady, one of the ladies on the commission, who says she's sick and tired of hearing about it, she's voting no regardless. Well, how can somebody on a commission who's supposed to vote on the details, just come out at a pure emotion. She just says, she just don't give her crap about it. That's all that's at a lorry, whatever her name is. She just don't give a flying crap about it. Well, then she shouldn't be on the commission. Right. That's right. That's unbelievable. Amen. But listen, Neil, I will be out of town for the Ranger game. Yeah. And I would love to be at possibly the last game of the franchise history. Last game in franchise history. That's a little bit. You said before, they may be out of here, and I don't want to miss the last game. Well, the last game, then would be the Ranger game. I can't help you out. I'm saying, I can't miss all out, and I don't have any free tickets for it. I think you may have a problem there. Well, can I go to Tampa Bay? Please? There's a plain leaving in about 330 on US air, I think. Please. You mean you want to go to the lightning game? Is that what you try to say? Please, God. Because you do it a very, very weak job. You have to be a little more assertive, so you give me the goddamn tickets. Give me the goddamn tickets. What kind of an attitude is that? Hang on. All right. Lines seven, take care of that poor whim. Put it at Jesus. Quit acting like such a whim. Now, where is the thing I was looking at in this stupid article here? Brower in the reading could hinge largely on this and that. And I'm so sick and tired of this crap managed. Just a lorry perished, there you go. Lorry perished. She's the one that evidently cornered our spy report about 1130 that call we had from Saudi was at the meeting. She was the one who was also saying, well, let's, you know, when it dealt, let's drag it out. I don't spend $212 million without reviewing it and studying. It said, County Commissioner, lorry perished. I think it's irresponsible to vote on it today. What does it hurt to postpone it for a week? It might be fine, but I don't know that because I haven't read it. Well, read it, bitch. Read it and beep and get with it. God. They got a guy coming in here or musta like, I don't know. Maybe he has stocks all went up for something. Maybe he woke up on a right side of bed one day. But he wants to like guarantee underwrite any and all losses for the arena. They can't possibly lose any money. They bring in that goddamn Gary Bentman, the top man, the head cheese, the big huncho, the big Kahuna as we say here at IOD. And they still like our dillin' around over there. Unlike in date County where they like, oh, yeah, okay, whatever you say here it is. We just found it under my goddamn mattress somewhere. Here's 165 million, which is turned in at over 200 million. But hey, we'll put it in a bank and make it grow. They're just dillin' around over there. The dragon or feet, it almost looks. It looks to me like they're almost looking for an excuse as if to say, well, I don't think so. They probably went out and took a survey and cemetery village of all the old farts and they said, we don't need now our arena here. How about if we have an early bird there, huh? We could have the only arena in America with a concession stand with an early bird concession. The game don't start till 730, but they open the gates at 330. Okay, so you can eat here early, birded four. We could have a Morrison's cafeteria line right inside it. We could have a Sadie's buffet right inside the arena. Go over better than Halavine, sunrise. Oh, hey. Here's Wilton Manor, hello. Hi, Dio, are you doing? Okay. Good. What's up, for you? Yes. How many times am I going to see this raft hit the turf on the TV? I know it's ridiculous. Is it incredible? You mean the umpire? Yeah, I'm peaceful. We don't have raffery. Well, the umpire. Yeah, three times this morning. They just keep showing it over and over and over again. I think Dave Heide's got a good point, but nobody read his column this morning. They would stop showing this, of course, because they're just a bunch of grave robbers. And like I said, it's all a public in his country wants to see. He's just a bunch of grotesque violence stuff and stuff films. That's all they want. Yeah, it just seems like nice. And I say, stuff stuff. The terrible happens, the media just drags it on and on and on and on for weeks. Just not enough stuff. Okay, first time caller. Yeah. And I started listening to you right about when the act and he started talking about act. Yeah. That's great. That's too bad. I went off a bit, gained a few back. That's okay. But I'm right back on it. Yeah, I'm going to come to find something to do. Good. You hop off it for a little while. You hop right back on it. Yeah, that's what they said. No problem. Right. That's great. Also, I went to my first pants again last night, which was great. You weren't sitting behind me, were you? No, sir. Oh, thank God, because the phone you'd hear a dial tone so fast. These two guys, man, they were hooking a Chinatown. They were hooking a Chinatown. They were cocka and they were talking loud. Like you and I are talking right now. And they're sitting right behind us. That's incredible. All crap that had nothing to do whatsoever with the game. That's unbelievable. They should have been out. But we really enjoyed it. Yeah. The fan seemed pretty supportive. Yeah. And we had a great time. I was a good night last night, except for the name Fist Fight and the stands. They're right at the end. That was deplorable. Oh, you were disgusting. They were probably trying to put a show on for Wayne. But we really enjoyed it. And I was wondering if I could maybe snore for a ticket. You were wondering if you could go again. I was a week from tomorrow. I was telling you the Tampa Bay lightning that we better beat that night and cut the crap. Yeah, absolutely. Okay. Thank you. Line 4. Take your him at 6 gone 4 to go. This Jeff Moss with these damn tickets. We had a wheel show going here for a while. And now we got these free loading people on here that got basically nothing to say. Which is good because it's killing some good time. Oh, God. Do I wish we had Wayne Arnold come down here with some food today? You know what? Cause I got a hang around in up up there, you know, this afternoon for all. Oh, yeah. We should have Wayne Arnold come in here with something. How the hell am I going to make it all day without anything? The least thing could do is cater like a little something over here. Then I'm going to have to sit around with her hot shots over there and listen to a bunch of bull crap. What kind of garbage is that? Stealing minutes for my precious life. See, that's what I don't like is when people steal even one minute from your life. At that point, they ought to go right to jail do not pass go. They're stealing your precious time. And as we saw yesterday with John McSherry, Rest in Peace, we never know just how much time we got left when we weigh 352 pounds. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. Speaking of Wayne Arnold, I'm right across the street right now. Yeah. Bring some over. Yeah, George says bring something by. I'll call Murray. What do you want? You're at 125th and 441. Yeah, and the public following on the custard. What? For an hour here in Wade. Well, how fast can you get down here? George can call Murray right now. About 20, 15, 20 minutes, I guess. And what are we going to do? Give you tickets and exchange for it? Well, I'm the guy who gave you the Toronto Maple Leaf clock. Oh, yeah. I already gave you that. That's right. You gave me something already. So you don't have to bring the food down here. I'll bring it anyway, sir. That's good. So you want to go to the game, right? Yeah. That's a deal. And then George will rings the whole thing. He's masterful with that. Hang on. Okay, line two. Take care of that guy and calm him down so we don't hang up. And then Tomory went a whole bunch of stuff. We wanted down here by 130. Because I'm not going to starve here all day because we got a bunch of hot shots. So in here with the Cox corporate bull crap going on. It never ends here, man. It just never ever ever ends. Talk about neurotic repetition. Oh, Jesus. Here is the plantation. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm going to bring the arena out near the saw grass. The Brower one. A big your part in the saw grass. It was a plan on being built near the saw grass. Possibly. Well, did you just come out of a coma or something? I want to make sure before I say the next statement. Possibly there. Possibly at Brower to 95. Possibly adjacent to Papadopark. Those are the three sites that they didn't know. Well, the saw grass I think was number one. Yeah. And it's Wayne's. The three highs thing to work for Preston hand. And the swap shop. Yeah. So anything that's going to bring people to the saw grass is going to hurt her directly. So. Well, then why do you think she snows snowball on this thing? Stonewall on this thing. Who's who's the us no baller? For reparish. What does Lori perish after do with it? She not the commissioner that's stonewalling the boat. No, she's not the one. She's got nothing to do with the site. She isn't she doesn't want to. You don't understand what I'm saying. What do you say? I'm saying to most people want it. No, let me say it again. That's the site that the Panthers want. All right. Who owns the Panthers? Wayne. Right. So where's the logic of what you just got. Well, tell me again. She works for Preston. Who does? Lori. Pyrish. Oh, Lori perish works for Preston hand. There you go. What the hell is she got to do with Preston hand? She works for. She works at the Swapshot. She works at the Broward Commissioner. Works at the Swapshot. Yeah. Why did she do, Lori? Who's the Natria? His new album, Do You Wets is a smash. All do I's is still got it. And I'm keeping it baby. So now, Frank Sinatra sings the 90. Yeah, what the heck? I'm almost there anyway. Frank Sinatra is the Red Hot Chili Pepper. Give it away. Give it away. Give it away now. All are all freaking taken. The chairman of the board sings right-set Fred and spans the years while touching a whole new generation. All right. Two sexy former half. Two sexy former half. Even though I'm old and fat. You won't want to miss. Frank Sinatra's new sound that's as fresh as tag tea. Hey, pops. I really dig those crazy dreadlocks. Whoa, there it is. I said, whoa, there it is. You wrecked out wiggie. Winked you. Branks and atges. Things the night. They're available now. Reckless stores and nights of Columbus halls. Everyone can't touch this unless you're buying it. So anyway, it's 107 a WOD. We're sitting here on pins and needles. They're on a verge of voting and Brooks said it looks good. How does she know that? Did she personally pull them? I mean, so to speak. She said it's going to pass five to two. It looks like now. And we're sitting right on the edge. Waiting for like a big explosion to take place. So we'll find out for you. Like any second. Just keep it right here. Just keep your finger on it and we'll we got our pulse. What do we got? Three pair of these to give away yet. We give away seven. I hope I'm counting right. Because the last thing I want to do is give away tickets that we don't got in the pull out of one of these bogus contest. We always do. We got three left, right. George. We got three pairs. I thought I thought I should. I should my head are not enough in doing it. Well, how can I see what I'm slumped back here in the chair on a new thing? There's a lot of pressure going right now. We're waiting for the result of this vote. Don't you understand the future where this Goddam of our lives, the degrees of our lives? And if you believe that, here's a pop in a hello. All right. How are you doing? Okay. Listen, I don't know if you heard the report before, but it's just another example of them walking everything. They gave a report about why the tourism was down in Miami. Yeah. South Florida. And they blamed it on the weather up north. It wouldn't have anything to do with. Wait a minute. What do you mean by that? The weather up north has been a nightmare. It's been the worst winter in recent memory. They break it all records for snow. Why shouldn't the tourism be better than ever? Exactly. That's what I'm saying. What does that mean? They're telling us that the reason people didn't come down here is because they couldn't get out. Right. Give me a break. Give me a break. Oh, my God. Talk about the cities or the excuses never end. Oh, they just keep coming up with better and bigger excuses. Oh, nothing to do with the climb down here. Right. That's right. Our image is pristine, baby. Everybody around the world. When you tell me you're from Miami, you work or live in Miami. They look at you like I can't believe you're still alive. Oh, my God. I mean, I only know if I just got a Godfather that he hit him with five shots and he's still alive. And also for all cancer fans, including myself. Yes. Sailor, Caribbean and said. There you go. There you go. Just say goodbye to Carnival Cruise lines. That's my suggestion. And the Harold. I will never tell Carnival Cruise lines. I will never subscribe to Miami. Harold either. The Harold could start putting $100 bills inside of each edition. And I still wouldn't go out and buy it. I would just break into one of those damn of ending boxes. Exactly. Listen, I'd like to stuck around for a couple tickets. Okay, you got them. All right. Thank you. See you there next Wednesday. Okay. Hang on. Purple eye. Take care of that guy. Okay. That's eight. Here we got two to go. But who cares about free hockey tickets? The one thing we finally got. See, I understand him on big hockey fan. He's a great player. He's a great player. He's a great player.

And he says, well, if we get the number 8 Fry, we have a pretty good match up against Chicago. I'm in. I'll go. We have lucky and beat them. Pretty good match up right like our story. Yep. Hey, listen. Even the Raptors beat the bulls' one. Game, what the hell does that prove it? Sorry if you listen to this Aim. Little him says, that not even because they beat us here the last time, because we didn't want to go out and guide the him pronounce it strongly. to play defense, okay? But that they might have better count than we do. Yeah. If he out of his goddamn mind or what, I want to back it live and play off. The big boys. That's right. Yeah. I want this asshole to call your show or call him Blow-Campere next Sunday. And I want him to give him directions. And I will meet this asshole anywhere and I'll beat the living hell out of him. Okay. But Neil, listen. Yeah. This asshole doesn't realize that the biggest faggot on this team of the lawns on morning. Yeah. He wanted to get out of the show. See, there's a bull's fan for him. All right. It's a done deal, baby. We got the right out. Oh, Mickey Harrison, blow it out to your little Weasley ass. We got it. Oh. How do you like that, huh? Oh, my God. Oh. There's a full Wall Street. Now, this is in the guard. And instead of this one, it's like, yeah. Oh Quiet it's sad to deny it. Revolves for champion. Revolves against the fight. Roll it out the line and pop in. Hit some knee and roll down to the Detroit blue line. Revolves kick. Do you? Start? What's this Attack? Yeah, what do you think of us? To the spirit of the song, Yeah, what is the spirit of the song? It's the spirit of the day, And the legend is shown now, But the spirit of the day, Oh no, the spirit of the day, The spirit of the day, The spirit of the day, The chance to win the Stanley Cup begins April 16th, On Moles and Hockey Night in Canada on CBC. So let's have a party here. We're celebrating with Wayne Arles right now. We got some stuff here. We got neatly burgers with bacon and cheese and no bun. We got white hot straight from Rochester with a little onion and no bun. We're doing the atkins. We're doing the scatkins. We're having a party here and Mickey Arrason. And you people at the Harold. Blow it out your ass. I do like that. We'll do our own thing in Broward. Thank you. Five to two vote. It's binding. It's done. It's signed. See you'll deliver it. Yeah, have a little of that crap. I mean, that's good stuff. So how do you like that, huh? After all of this national fatigue, Didn't I tell you all along? It's not done deal. Wasn't I the one voice of sanity in this other way in this sea of wilderness? That said, no problem. Don't worry about it. Remember it's a done deal. After all these hysterical phone calls and after all these rumors. And after all this in you window and hysteria and paranoia. Didn't I say, just calm down. It's a done deal. I never said that. So anyway, it's 123 a W.I.O.D. You know, Dr. Andrew and I was trained. Taste and movies. What's next? Me, you'll don't like it. The amateur hour. Sunday, night at 11. On news, talk and entertain the radio. 610 W.I.O.D. Oh, Neil. My queen. God. That little rod you live like a boy guy. If you're an atheist to the squish in your stride. This local foot stows and ride around in your bed. You got a radio show. You can just fall to check. Happy anniversary to Neil. The only thing in this town that's for Neil. He thought Mr. from miles around just to hear that. Famous farting sound. Around the act can't stop. Take the fret off your sandwich. And like taking fun of sister Mary Mandage. Neil Rogers, you're the best. Really put my amy to the test. Neil Rogers, always gets no your day. Neil Rogers, you're fine. I got to do a bear. Neil Rogers, the only thing I miss when I go. When a wave for a week and excited to have fun of love. But happy anniversary. Neil, always love your show. Okay. What's 28 at WILT? It's a great day for the Irish to Jewish to Chinese. The specs the everybody. It's a hell of a day, baby. So we got our onti. By the way, what are they voting also on the site selection? Are they going to take care of that today? Are they overwhelmed by the emotion? Look at Johnny dark. He's got a big smile. His face is in. All right. We got something in brown besides due does. They voted five to two. Yes. It's a binding deal. It's in. We're going to put it now. Up your ass. They can't fit. Yeah, can. So anyway, I don't know where the guy just was asking that. Oh, there's I'm a second just what he needs is some more publicity. Okay. I guess they got tired of Howard. So now we're going to have I'm in son. Every goddamn channel morning noon and night before he Croaks would try to be pretty soon from the looks of it. God. Does he look bad or what? A bigger part. A girlfriend of least. I hate. He's a brand of that. He's pretty. Sure. She's a real cute little blonde piece. He's a. I thought she was 30. Thirty one or two. What piece. Yeah. A vase. So what's wrong with that? No, no. Oh, you can't see that on the coast. I know that. You wouldn't go over there. Say, hey, how about that? I'm a set out beautiful piece. I see. You wouldn't say that on a coast. You might actually have some numbers over there. Okay. This because you got a bunch of dumb holios. Listen, the glory has def on records all day. Watch this. Play in that bitch. Okay. He's not a damn CDs in there. And burn them. We love her. Yeah, but you do. You hate her like poison. Why don't you be honest. Why don't you say, this is iodine at the coast. You can't stand Gloria Estefan. I like her. You wouldn't touch her with a ten foot tongue. Oh, I was she's great. Yeah, you look at that. He's got his legs crossed when he's saying it. His eyes is legs on his tongue. He speaks with fork tongue. So we got the arena. So Mickey Harrison sticking up your ass. Oh. And all you go I'm over there at the Harold. All you antisemites. Wipe your ass with your nose paper. because we got it and guess what we're gonna build it. The arena date will never be built. They're gonna put it at the saw grass I hope. I don't know. I just got you asking that question before you open the door and waddle your fan ass in here. I hope so that would be nice. Now what do you care? You're not going there. I don't want to, I'm 90s. How about if they have concerts? I don't want it to brown. How about if they have some hillbilly in there, okay? Then you'd love going see it. I wanted it at the saw grass. For what? Because that's where it should be. Right. Because that's where it should be. And Johnny Darks and Manu stands up for principal, even always full of crap. Plus the infigures he can get some free concerts tickets. And you don't want to go to Broward 95 because there's too many dark folks over there and they don't listen to the coast. So what does he care? Here's not Street. You don't have no. How many black list do you have on a coast? One. One. And he said they got him tied up in a room somewhere. Like in Clockwork Orange. That's right. Instead of Beethoven, they're playing Gloria at Stephon over and over and over. Oh, God, a fate worse than death. So anyway, here's the Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I feel like the good news, pal. Oh, I think it's excellent. Oh, hey, for Hollywood. I went to the first fan to the game last night and I had a great time. All right. I'm telling you. 30 years, 30 more years of panther. Is how do you like that? I think it's excellent. I thought it was a work Johnny. Really? I felt the structure last night with that little penalty. Yeah, he tried hard. They pulled it out. I guess he thought there was like a minute, 15 left. He didn't realize it was only 15 seconds. Yeah. I think it's to make it real exciting. That's screwy. They should have buried them, though. I really think that they're going to suck it up because it's crunch time now. We played that real conservative third period. We almost paid a wicked price for it. Exactly. They're not going to do it. I did. The puck was down in the way. There's no more. We'll take the two points. Thank you. We'll take Buffalo beat and Montreal out there. Thank you. So we're back in fourth place. Now, seeing now, I can really get into the ester because now it's not just a temporary little thing. Now it's a part of our lives. Exactly. And now we can look forward to no more at the arena and hopefully something will happen. Right. Hopefully it'll be the saw grass. I like that location also. Right. So let's take a bend over. Right. Bend over. Johnny says he wants to bend over. What do you think? Johnny, Johnny, Johnny just a- I would've caught buddy, I would've been over. Johnny just had cock a moon. Okay, hang on. Thank you. Line five. That's our last pair of free tickets. Okay, for now that hockey game against Tampa Bay and every game from here on out should be sold out. You know, I'm going to have to say something on the year now that I never thought I would say. It takes a big man to sit his ass in his chair and say what I'm going to say. Okay. First of all, let's thank that little Jew Gary Betman for coming down and doing a good job because we never would've got this to without Gary. Thanks, Gary. We love you sweetheart. Even though you were kind of a bozo during the lockout. Thanks to Gary Betman he's okay. You knew a little Jew could come down here and Fonegler goes up and Broward. But as far as Wayne is concerned, you know what? I never thought, you know what we're going to do? George. George. We're going to take every one of those songs that's in the DCS and we're taking them out. You know what I'm talking about? Out to lunch? All the Wayne songs were taken amout. Never to be played on a show again. Because I'm not here, you know, I'm not saying that anything that I've said last two years is wrong because Wayne doesn't a lot of things to piss off a lot of people including me. But when push came the show, here's a guy to cut a soul to team to Nashville to pour into all kinds of places. They were desperate for this team. He could have said screw you guys. Okay, I'm losing 20 million a year in that piece of direct on there. I'm putting up with that little asshole Mickey Eris and I've had it. And he finally found something he liked. He's not that crazy about that whole Marlon deal over there from what I hear. He's not all that crazy about the dolphins unless Jimmy J turns that thing around. He likes the, uh, he likes the Panthers. He likes, he's into it. He's there most of the games. He's standing up when I have the free t-shirts. He's standing there. I want it. I want it. Like everybody else. So we, we're going to kiss his ass right here collectively. Come on Wayne. That's for you sweetheart. All is forgiven. Come home. Here's a guy that he, because without his going out there and underwriting all this stuff and all the guarantees without every extra thing that he did, there would be no arena and I guarantee a no Panthers and no hockey and just like Yuri Bettman said last night, don't think if you lose this team, you're going to be getting another franchise real quick because it's highly unlikely. So we're kissing Wayne's ass today. How do you like that? I'm doing it personal on both cheeks. That's right. It's an embarrassing thing for a grown man to have to do to eat a little bit of crawl. Let's put some of this Wayne Arnold hot sauce on it. Not so bad. Thanks to Wayne and thanks for the guy that picked up the food. That's my good pal, what a eternal clock. And by the way, did we find out who those guys were at the end of our roll last night or night? That's the most important thing. Make sure they come back again soon. It's the bitch though. So anyway, thanks Wayne from the bottom of our parts. Okay, Wayne, I see I start doing it again. I started calling him that grow test that unacceptable name. If I ever say that again, dump it. And then let me know where you're working the day after that. Thanks Wayne. Thanks Gary. Thanks Bill Tory. Thanks Brian Murray. Thanks for the memories. Even at Doug McCleany. He ain't doing so good lately. Screw him. But let's thank all the other guys. Because we finally got something good. We're going to keep it in Broward and those guys. And Dave, you can dittle around now. You can screw around from now until the end of time. This is a binding. It's written. It's engraved in Braille and Stone. It's etched in marble. How do you like that? That's what Jennifer just said. And she better not be making it up. 135 at WIOD. You ever get to feeling when it's your hairline slowly received. So does your image. Take a look at Wayne. See there he goes again. 10 seconds out of the box. He's starting to pick on him again. It's a news that matters to you. Counties that are warranted on a tame wind the program before the program exists in her now. And a tame who both were involved. Coast Guard official did question both party finally. He's a cop. That's, that's, that's got an off the idea that we have all the answers. So, the best news. He's talking to their tame but pretty old. 16 WIOD. I just got to get drunk. We've been friends for a long time. We've gone through a lot together. Yep. I guess it never told you what you mean to me. I love you man. So can I have your satellite? Sure. Take it. Have the whole six back. Hey, thanks. Now come here and give me a big kiss sugar lump. What? Kiss me full on the mouth. Wait a minute. I think there's been a misunderstanding here. I just wanted your beer. And I just want your hand on my push. Don't deny our love my little sweet cake. Now come here. Hey, did your hands up me? That's not my hand. No. No. You'll do anything for a satellite. Well, almost anything. So anyway, 20 till 2. I'm having my own little party here. I see Andy's participating in George and Mark and Johnny Dark. Mark in the dark. Have it a little way and Arnold here to celebrate, which is always good for up. Good laugh or two. That's right. So anyway, all we want to do is say one thing to Mickey Eris and I'll came out that I've kissed way and on both cheeks. Hey, Mickey, take your heat and stick them in your rectum. I mean, like way inside there, baby. If they're still room after that 666 that's tattooed inside your cheeks, just like it is on the inside of the anus of our good friend over there at Tony, Ritter at the Herald, huh? See, what they were trying to do, they really thought that they had this thing all nailed down. Maybe they're going to do their little sub-to-fuse there. The Broward Commission's going to start getting real week at the knees, which they did. They're going to pee in their pants and they're going to back out which they did not. And the panthers are going to get out of town which they are not. And they don't have their own ball game. Well, guess what? The heat now is sucking wind. Because if something happens, not just the Dan Paul thing, but if anything else happens, and a stingfall through which I guarantee that it will and they'll never build that arena in date, where is the heat going to play? How about maybe in Geneva, New York sounds good to me? How about in your arena that they're already in? The President Arena. Mickey Eris is going to have to probably come up some way with his good buddies to shell out some extra money to put a few sky boxes in here if they can do it. And maybe some extra seats like upon a roof looking down. And that's where he's going to be stuck. See? It's the anti-Christ. See what goes on? The onions are coming from the front of my mouth down to the back of my throat and I'm not even chewing them. It's the goddamn anti-Christ. The Spirit of Christ compels you. That's what I'm saying right now, Mickey Erison. And you jackasses over to Miami-Herald, especially but not exclusively Tony Ritter. The Spirit of Christ compels you to take on your BS and your devious ways and insert them deep inside your rectum right now. How do you like that? We finally got something that made sense done. They can call it the Wayne Heizinger arena for all I care. We're going to get it and that's it. And so he is in many ways a jackass. And as whole I don't want to say that we're done here. But hey, when the bottom line comes when push came to shove, here's the guy that bailed our ass out. Thank you Wayne. Not both cheeks. Here's a mobile in Miami Beach, hello. Hi, don't you? Okay. Take, there's pigs everywhere he might be today. Metro and Miami Beach. Great. They are actually on on pine tree drive. They have a checkpoint. They're stopping. Check. Check, like Charlie again. Here we go. Every single car and they're checking for passport and ID. Yeah. It's not a control. Yeah. And also. You know, they're probably checking to see if any people from Broward are down here. When he's seven, so now it's a night. And what are they doing? Making it safe for us. Oh, yes. Right. Of course. I mean, my God forbid, I have my car stolen two weeks ago. And now this is what my money, my tax money. That's right. Checkpoint Charlie. Even at Nazi Germany, they never had anything like this. Is that a control? Mm-hmm. All right. Good luck to you, pal. I'm out of here. Okay. So we got two open lines in day. We gave away all our 10-pera hockey tickets. We can feel like all this bull crap is over. But I do want to ask that question to my, who's going to tell me the answer? Because that's obviously right away we want to define out, you know, the answer to the question that we get in it or not, which we are. Thank God. But what about the site selection, isn't that where they were supposed to pick that out today? Is it going to be the soil grass? Is it going to be God from mid-Brower 95, which will take it if that's the best we can get? Or is it going to be up at Papua no park, which I seriously doubt? Ted Snow, I seriously doubt it. Here's Hollywood on a purple line, hello. Hello Neil. Yes sir. Got a great, uh, hell, the old story for you. Okay. I get a new, uh, elevator to go visit my grandmother. She was on a 21st floor. Guys. Oh, hey. Two guys in front of me, uh, they, they're in the elevator with me. They hit 17. And then what? I got to go 17 floors with these guys. One sense to the other, uh, I need to get my clay pot moved off my terrace. And the other guy says, I want you to ask Ryan to do it. He says, is Ryan the white guy is either black guy. He says, well, don't ask him to do it because he's lazy. Yeah. And that's the story. Well, uh, the indicative of how the, the old Jewish people were used to the stereotype and I'm Jewish. So I just thought that, uh, me him being Jewish was a dangerous impsterate at the black guy. Who the black guy was Jewish? I'm Jewish. Yeah. And the black guy was Jewish. Ask Sammy Davis to do it. Okay. I'm going to tell you the house he's talking about. He had 30 city at a great story. Well, maybe he's saving a great story for the next time when we still have some tickets left. Thanks a lot, pal. You're okay. Here's, uh, Hollywood on a purple line is going, but I don't understand what's going on here. Purple line just opened up, mobile one. So where the hell was I? I'm in a state of euphoria. Plus it must be too many of these white huts. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. You know, I ain't doing. Okay. I haven't seen you in a while. I haven't breakfast courtesy of Rick and Suss and you walked in in the bouquet of the studio. You did it about face immediately. Yeah. You call that day. No. I called. I just walked in. I heard about the tickets, but I see they're gone. But I want to let you know something anyway. I've tried to call on a couple of occasions. They have this, um, magazine type thing, put out by the greater Miami, um, culture events, uh, a Ferris Council. Uh-huh. And they get all the, like, the Marlins games in here and the heat games. Never mention of any Panther games. Yeah, of course not because they're about to anti-Semite. They want the hockey team out here. How do you like that? Just like the hero. You're not full of us over there. That's why you give us crappy coverage because you don't like hockey. You don't like the Panthers. And if they don't like something, man, they want it out. If it's not part of their little, their little empire, they want to get rid of it. Uh-huh. Incredible. How do you like that? Um-huh. Well, we got a real surprise for them. I'll wait and see it. Okay. Good luck to you, pal. You'll need it. So we got an open line in date, 751 WIOD on a great day here in the history of South Florida, Market Town on your calendar April 2, 1996. It's the day after April full, but we're not full and okay. So now it's going to be real interesting to see if Mickey's going to go at a loan over there. Over there by the port of Miami with their billion dollar boom dog, that they're going to build. And they'll probably stick to goddamn metro mover right out there to drop you in the middle of the goddamn bay. How does that sound, huh? Just slide off the end of the metro mover and they'll drop you right off in there and you can swim your way into the arena. That sounds good to me. Because quite frankly, I think you're drowning over there, Mickey. I think that you've really cut off more than you can chew. Maybe Daddy's got more money than Wayne, but when it comes to a battle of egos, you're not even in the ball game. Okay, Mickey, you a hot shot, dot the eye, Mr. Hot shot. He was going to show everybody. He was going to pull off his cute little trick of his. He was going to chase everybody outside of town so we can have the whole ball game to himself. You can take your goddamn basketball and pat Riley and your heat and all the gotts and mishpaka and stick them all inside your rectum and keep them there. How do you like that? And Linda Blair says high by the way. Yeah, that's right. 147 at W.I.O.D. George. Use talk at entertainment radio. 610 W.I.O.D. It's a party out there. What is it, monkey diving Canada? And you see what you buy, bulls and exports. Excess it all. My board of Canada, where quality is job 1, is working by a very loyal and desolate sociologist. Probably one of the leading sponsors of you, cocky in Canada. And by Pepsi, got a habit. Yeah, yes. So anyway, 151 at W.I.O.D. We can put this all aside now. We can come back to a little bit of normalcy. We can relax, take a deep breath and just move on to our next major crisis. Here's a mobile at D'Ral. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. Yes, it is. I'm not a shining somewhere. I mean, this is wonderful. Finally, I show that hurdle people. I mean, it was close. I thought it wasn't going to go through. I had my serious doubts. Rave doubts. So now it looks like they're going to have to stuff it down here in Miami. Yeah, let them stuff it. Well, it's going to be kind of hard to swing by people with just 220 million dollars. So start it out 165. Now it's, I think, up to about 300 million by today. Just keep the numbers keep changing every day. I really thought they're going to do that. So I guess they'll be planning the up and, uh, Broward's goop. Well, won't they if they let them in? Uh, of course. If they let them in. And of course, if they do let them in. Now they're going to be like the second day retin it. Are they going to be sucking wind? Again, isn't that a bad break for them? No big deal. You know, Pat, which is up to get used to Broward, that's all. Yeah, paddle does have to get a different hairdo. Yeah. Yes, sir. Wait, I think that your meal. There you go. See, we're kissing his ass today. We finally realized, you know, everybody kissed and made up. He treated us pretty crappy there for while. He said some bad things. He did some bad things. He quite frankly was an asshole for a while. And he finally said, you know something. I want to show everybody. I'm not always an asshole. And he said, let me show you how much I'm sincere about this. And I'm going to do something. And he did it. Okay. And we're saying, all right. Let's just do it again. Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Great. I just wanted to call and tell you. I saw you at the game last night. Good game, huh? There was okay. It was okay. It was great. It was great. Well, it was great. Yeah. It was a little scary in the beginning. It was a little scary, yeah. Yeah. I just wanted you to know that I'm from out of town. And I think that you're really sharp and witty. And every time I'm here, I listen to you. Where are you from? I'm from South Carolina. South Carolina. South Carolina. South Carolina. All right. But I think that you're the king. You are God. I am. I'm a whole royal family. Yeah. The king of Queen of Prince of the Princess. And that too. And that too. Right. Yeah. I cut that here. Yeah. And that too. And that too. And for him for. Right. And the king. I inspired drive fear. The only thing we have to fear is making your uson. Right. So. So. You know, having more tickets left? No, I sure don't. Oh, I want to make another trip. And I was thinking if I got some tickets. Sorry. I can have their trips. I bet they'll have them at the box or a fist though. I bet you they will. Okay. Well, me all you are the king. Thanks, we are God. I'll see you there. You take care. Bye. Bye. Y'all come back. Wow. What a day, huh? Now that it got some assistance in me here. Thanks. Thanks to Wayne Haisinger. And thanks to Wayne Arnold. Okay. And thanks to Wayne the board up. And thanks to Wayne Newton. That's right. Even him. Anybody named Wayne. Even if you're a piece of crap. Even if you're a major scumbag. Anybody named Wayne. We give you special dispensation today. That's for every Wayne. Because the Wayne and Spain. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. How are you, everybody? Fantastic. You know, there's never ever chance that two arenas are going to make it. It's lucky to take you. It's still one arena right now. There's no possible way in the world that this town can afford two arenas. Yeah. What is your feedback on that, Mr. Rogers? My feedback is I don't think there's going to be two arenas. This is going to be one in Broward. Oh, that's the way. I don't think the day the arena is ever going to be built. That's what I've been saying for like three days now. I know that. And another thing is I'm so happy. I'm happy. I've been night. I have to drive through how and they'll get the Hollywood. And the Canadians are history. They're gone. Thank God. That's all I could say. Thank God. And Neil. Yeah. That's all I could say. Okay. I have no idea what it was, but it was moving and it was moving north real fast. Okay. Hopefully it was about your frogs. Old ones. If you ever noticed how all the frogs that come down here, they're all reload. They're all older than death. Don't they understand we got enough old people here already. We don't need a new shipment every fall. Okay. We don't need a new shipment of death of the King rotting bodies. We got plenty of our own already. Thank you. Send some living and breathing young people. They may be okay. Okay. So we find out who that was. The row or not yet. Probably related to somebody here and I better shut up. Here's Orlando. Hello. Hi, Neil. You're happy. Yeah sir. You can make some extra money with parking now too. Yeah right. That's right. Good idea. Anyway. Why would the heat not want to play him? Broward. Don't you understand? The heat. Mickey Erison's whole thing that's down there at the port of Miami. I don't want to go back to the whole thing again. Okay. His whole deal is at the port of Miami. Well, there'll be knocking on the Broward arena pretty soon. Well, the door. It's too late. I think door shut. How to lunch? A minute ago when you were playing that bit with all the Jewish people. And you said something about Harry Carrey Wells probably an hour ago. Yeah. Did you know Harry Carrey's grandson was the commentator for the magic? Yes. Chip. Yeah. Why did you say it like nobody knows who chip Carrey is? I didn't know if you could. He happens to be very handsome young man. Yes. Hey, he does pretty good job in the game. Yeah. And his father is a skip carry with the braves. Right. Yeah. And his father's carry with the cubs and his father's dead. Well, obviously you know. Right. Well, Neil, you had a great show. I listened to you all last week on vacation. And it was really good. That's great. You're here a bird go back for you belong. Well, that's the way it goes. Have a great day, pal. Thanks, Neil. Get out of here. You're killing me. Oh, God was he boring. Here's the four lot of nails gone. What do we got here? Who's this? Hello. Hey, Neil. You're doing a presentation. That's your disc friend over in plantation. Yes, sir. Listen, I want to absolutely congratulate you. You got it done, man. I got it done. That's right. When push comes the shop, give me all accredited on the one I got it done. You got it? It wasn't for my enthusiasm. For my tenacity and perspicacity and person appearance, this thing never would have gotten done. We'll have a little credit to Wayne a little bit to a Gary Bettman. Yes, the commissioners, but generally speaking, it was me that put it over the top. That is right. You did it. You said, because in government, On the one that made hockey the important thing, I made it the center of the focal, the center piece of so many lives in his town. On the one that gets the credit. You've got Neil Downs Arena. And you did a great job. Right. Compliments. Goodbye. See you. Okay. 157 at Wild. Let's do a lantern. Hello. Yes, sir. I want to say congratulations, Mickey Harrison, on your new dry dog boat on the arena here. Right. Hope you know what I mean? Hope it don't sink. It's going to be storm boats in a few years. Uh-huh. Stick it up your ass. Right. Okay. Now they're making Euras in fan right there for you. It's all the more reason to stick it to the hero, baby. Just tell him, hey, guess what? You didn't pull the wall over our eyes, especially those of us who live in Broward. And you can take your paper and shove it to. Are they voting on the site selection also today? Do we know? Oh, they are not. What are they going to do then? Uh, I don't know. But a portion of that article you were talking about this morning, the Sun Sentinel Art. Yeah. Was inaccurate. Oh, that's a first for them, yeah. And we were right this morning. See, we were right. How do you like that? John Rodström, God. That's all I can say. We were right. And the Sun Sentinel as usual a day late in the dollar short. Trying to accentuate the negative because they live in the shadow of the Miami Herald and there are a bunch of pussies. That's right. The Sun Sentinel don't have the balls. Maybe once in a while, Dave Heider, some of the individual columnists have got the balls to go up there and write a real column and say something. But generally speaking, the editorial board of the Sun's scum Sentinel are a bunch of pussies and they were intimidated by the Mickey Erisons of this world and by the guy damn a Miami Herald and Knight Ritter. And that's why they had that stupid and sippin sucking call at a Turalist morning about, well, leave the door open for the heat and don't lock them out. No, you know, all this other crap. If they're there fine, if they're not there, who gives a crap, okay? Because the bottom line is that Mickey Erison lied. He tried to stick it to us. He tried to play a little nasty hostile vicious game with his selfish selfish, most disgusting goddamn attitude. See, when you're born into all that money, when daddy's got the billions with a B size, I'm going to Israel to become a professional Jew. I'm going to have all a goddamn money here. I'm going to show everybody what I'm made of. We saw it. We can smell it. We know what you're made of, Mickey. We can smell it right over here, baby. There it is. So pilot deep, keep giving that shovel going. In fact, he's building a new arena right now. And the site selection for the Browder Reena is April 9th. April 9th for the Browder Reena is side selection. Thank you so much. Which sounds like a week from today. We can pee in our pants and have another party again. Next to a CD wrong. We can go back to the TV test pattern. Mornings with Rick and Sud, WIOD. Miami Fort Lauderdale, news, talk and entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. Good afternoon. As to what Hawke on Jennifer Ramwitz, 610 WIOD news brought to you by AT&T Wireless. After hours of pucking around, good news for Broward hockey fans. WIOD's Brookolph and brings us a live report from the Broward Commission, where a vote on the proposed arena has just wrapped up. Brook. If we're within the past hour, the county commission voted five to two to approve a binding letter of intent to build a new arena for the Florida Panthers.
