Yes, they are and they're going like hotcakes I'd love to be able to get bored and have it on a graph by you or Okay, I'll get one of yours when we get the passion while we autograph that we had a very Dismal turnout although where you're up to like about 50 grand. I'll raise even in November So we're doing real great on sale I think it's because they're in a border deal and people just want to come on and see our ugly faces again Seriously, the fact that all was a disaster we had like almost nobody there. We still raised about nine grand on how The fact that we had a thing at the pizza lots which we did well there this weekend with the sunglasses So let's see you again based based on this The saw grass right here has a little California Yeah, last week now they got something called the Ontario Mills mall And they said this is a fantastic unique concept in shopping and you've got to see this It's a flood-race mill more. Oh, look how a little join see them What is the mall out there this like um it's years ago that was there about 10 years ago, but it's like the biggest mall in a world You think it California yeah, I think it's a ball of America in there.

Yeah, you know and And the people get off at Miami to drill crazy in Miami and I forgot how much they are here You know at least they go somewhere there Emotions as you know is in the ghetto so when I go is it I leave at night. What is it once? It's actually I should say the ghetto. It's been a working class part of Los Angeles called Maria Palo But it is a parietan. That sounds good. Yeah, it is a part of city that got burned during the 92 riot Oh In fact, I don't know if you do this but the the host of AFI during the riots I had their broadcasts from a remote site because they had National guards surrounding the station So I leave there at I don't know if it's been at night. If I got to go up normandy, which is the normandy of course normandy The flash point of the riot right and I'm doing like now Yeah, it's brutal We're gonna have some little audience now so I started in a couple days now I couldn't hear a less but everybody else thinks it's great so I guess I'm gonna have to talk about yeah You gotta do it And Well our Panthers are doing good with one night You are night night I am not a unless I look for it It seems like we need flat to me they played pretty crappy Kevin Stevens.

Oh god, what a funny stuff at a WIDM, I'm a mortgely spread after a hearing from Phil Henry. Oh, here's what? It's still didn't get on after wait in the light of time. Maybe that is shame, I'm really excited for you. Only in this town could we get Phil Henry on there and then follow it with that. You don't understand? Unbelievable. So typical that there are no words to describe it. We have two old blinds that are out of town lines, one AAA 949 WIO D1888949. Well, I'm still like it's a regular everyday for a couple of hours. Here's a lady in North Miami Beach, so. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I want to, you didn't know I'm going to take up donation. So you and Phil and the reconvence can all get back on your own re-U station and sell rest of them. What to do? So, we're going to go out there and sell rest. So, we're going to go out there and sell rest. So, this station was very highly successful. The only problem was that they weren't making as much money as they wanted. And then all of a sudden, the last year that cock soldered, they started to make it a lot of money with it. And then this year, kids, all of the stations were strongly practically given as a holiday gift. And they started tinkering with it, bringing in consuls and just chasing everybody off and doing. I don't know what these people are thinking about it. They're not thinking about themselves. So, we already and the Internet, the wonderful people and the forefathers, because my kids may go in for free. Everyone is excited about this thing. Mr. Michele, there's an interview to offer a dedicated interview to the shout Git address. Well, Dr. Michele, in Stangenen B. He says the people are there. The guys who've worked in real-for-make donations and maybe you're getting invited to Pennsylvania. Yeah. I'm aware. I'm aware. Ten-cell mayors. Hmm. I tell you, it's a very, very good place. Yeah. Okay. Just wanted you to know. I'm taking up the money to get that new radio station for you. Okay, sweetheart, we're waiting. Okay. Okay. Small bills. Thanks. Open line in day 6-2-9-4-6-3-1 in Broward. So how can there be open lines here after we just said, till I'm here. I should have kept going and taken a lot of calls for him. But that would have been a good idea. I want to said, Jack, didn't back to this again. He's probably getting spoiled with lots of great calls out there with an LA-OMB-ONS to kind of real-boring crowd out there. That real-picy, quality, STR-L-A-Crad. 130 in WI-O-D.
