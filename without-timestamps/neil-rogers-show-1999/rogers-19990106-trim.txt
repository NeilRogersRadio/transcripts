We should have written down what was called what was sponsored, but it was on the weather channel. Maybe some of you have seen this but I have never seen anything like this in my life, in my life. On the bottom of the screen throughout the entire end, on every part of the commercial, there was a fish symbol. The message is only if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a fish symbol, if you are a great game, Pittsburgh and Calgary last night, what a performance by Marty Strocka. Oh my god! Play or the game, he was unbelievable, anybody see that on your little dish? Wow! Marty Strocka, I told him I tried to tell that hard ass dog McLean, now these people listen to me, I don't know nothing, okay? So anyway, I managed to stay away through two periods and take the third period went to bed, and for some bizarre reason, it must be my second powers again. Couldn't sleep with a crap. And why did I sleep with a crap? Because I was laying there thinking about this place. For the first time at a long time, I've had a real good success rate on that for several months now. Kind of putting all of that on the back burner and avoiding being considered about the bush league. But here it is a year later. Maybe Hank, kind of like so, the seed yesterday, because I'm driving home on here yesterday, and here Hank talking about our sales manager screw-in and about how she must have the naked pictures, and he had another major run-in with her and others, no communications in Yadi Adiani, which you heard me say a million times. And maybe that kind of like planted the seeds and rekindled because I've been sitting here with tremendous frustration for months on it. And now it kind of brings back all this whole long year. And here we are a year later, then I come in this morning. Because my dog, evidently, it must have rubbed off on him too little though. He couldn't sleep, and then all of a sudden he's scratching on the floor and he could be other room and all my god. Then this morning he keeps me up all night long and makes sure I get no sleep at all. And this morning I go in here and find, like bloody diarrhea all over, so he's a devette right now, okay? I think my little dog has bloody diarrhea from the QM sales department is what it is. Don't you think? I think that's what it is. I'm not sure if I think that the stress, you know how you transfer transference of stress because I was under enormous stress. And all of a sudden I noticed he couldn't sleep. He's a potking around, running around the floor, making deposits all over the place. And then by the time the morning came he was already not eating and had bloody stress. Oh man. So I've had a lovely dab and on my hands and knees scrubbing and just all kinds of stuff. So just all kinds of like bloody diarrhea off the carpet. Time for dry cups at what? I'm eating. Well excuse me, okay, that's part of the new Rogers diet. I mean it's no doctor stillman's lipotherm diet, which I'll talk about in a minute, which I see you have a page ad and a hero for this bull crap. It's not that, but it's the new Rogers diet. Just think about getting on your hands and knees with, you know, with wet towels, cleaning a bloody diarrhea from your dog, or maybe from like a human. And that'll, that'll put your appetite on the back of the back burner, huh? That's right. You'll lose your appetite so fast. You'll, the brains out. So little dog is at the vet this morning speaking of dogs, which we were yesterday. And like I said, anybody who's not a dog lover, although little dogs, it's a, oh, they're very specialized thing. It's a compartmentalized thing, little dogs. Tiny little yappy, painting the ass dogs who a lot. But then anyway, you know, during this, the first year, which ended December 30, I think I did about three shows that I can recall. Three shows where I just sat down here and I just went nuts. I just did a tie rate on this place. Three that I can recall very vividly. And I don't know, maybe I'll do another one today. Maybe I'm in the mood for it. I don't have a lot of energy because I had no goddamn sleep at all. Mostly because of my little dog all over the place, but also partly because I couldn't sleep, tossing and turning thinking about this place and the unprofessionalism and how they don't care. See, the first clue should have been the very first thing. We were on the year he last year and we go to the recorded commercials into the first spot, and we hear a spot where the guy is saying, oh, what the fuck, how cold I got on the door? From lobster, Termador. And it was like a muffled and muddy and you couldn't understand a guy. They were on the spot and I looked at George and he looked at me. We're saying like, if somebody really paying for that spot, is it that like supposed to be real commercial? Yeah, we care about it. No. And then it took us like about a month of screaming and yelling and curing on about that, till they finally decided that one of the car machines which is older than the thusla, maybe we shouldn't be playing carps in that because people are paying for their commercials. And then we went, we kind of after they got that kind of clear up. And remember that audio vault? The guy we came down here briefly and asked you that day that the audio vault was ended. We ever get that on QA and the audio vault? No. To have that computerized so that everything is clear and crisp, but you can actually understand what's being said, that we get that. No. But at any rate, so we kind of moved from that along to the Lenny Martes, the part has Robert Greeper, who's the other one that did the lobster termitor spot? Well, we moved along to the ten year old board ops doing the spots. Experiments or winning is all about what you're like there. Like that. People who can't speak people who are on intelligence, both people are probably very nice guys, but you can't understand what they're saying doing commercials. And it just, it just amazes me that, you know, these are people who they really don't care. They don't care about you, but when you work with people, and you know that they don't give a crap, it's very, it's the billiating. It's very frustrating and it's a real downer when you know that most of the people who work around you don't care about these things. They don't give a crap. I mean, not even a tiny little snob, not a crap. And then so I come in this morning and fight out from Georgian. We only fight away Greg Reid, you are the world's number one communicator, baby. I'll ought to try to this man. I can't say the S today, we're in the communications business, but there is none here. You'll never find any. So I'll cut we find out by accident, only because we had this one account where the copy S today was just unacceptable. And so George goes to Gary Sarner, the all-time bosom by the way, who just got a promotion, he's our new, well, what is the national? That's right. The bigger bosom you are here, the higher up the food chain, you go. That's right. The more naked pictures you got in the drawer, the higher up you go on the food chain. It's always the same tree people, it's the water not see, and it's the sale of Louis screw in, and it's Gary Sarner. They got all done, they get pictures. And we find out that there's been a reorganization in our sales department. Did anybody bother telling us about this? No. Did we know any of the people that they know them? Did we know us? No. Nothing. Apparently no one told anyone. No one told anyone. Like I said, Greg Reid, it's our award of the month. The worst communicator in history of radio. Why is it great meal and Ruth Chris? I appreciate that before. Where do you find? Hey, no bird. Right where do you got it? Hey, stop it. It's radio 5.6. Q.A.M. Bale people are high sold. I have no problem with default, but default is somewhat intimidated. And it's like laws or people are way, way, way, way, way. We're intimidated by what Jeff, what do you have that I'm intimidated by? Well, I don't know. You've got a trim red when I come under studio. Why would I turn red when you come in here? Just because I'm looking at a guy that's trying to warm his way under the show. I'm not warning my way. I don't want your way. I don't want your way. You know what? This goes back. Let's clear the air right now, Jeff. Yeah, back at the Adler Dreams former radio station. When you came on the air on Neil Rodgers show and trashed virtually everybody to work with the station. I got the feeling that you were sending a message to Neil and trying to work your way around going through conventional systems about getting a job on the air that you were staying and then I was standing back in your chances of getting on the radio. Absolutely. And that's what I kept hearing from people that knew you personally. And instead of saying it to me, you're running around saying, oh, well, this divorce is the reason I'm not getting a job. That's not true. That's not true. Anyway, I want to move on. I'm just going to move on. You're saying I'm jealous of what you're doing. And I'm not saying, what is that? You're coming up showing say that? No, I'm what I am saying, go, is this. I just feel sometimes you kind of get all uncomfortable. I'm intimidated by you. Who wouldn't be uncomfortable with a guy that's trying to stab you in the back? Oh. Yeah. Okay, 10.15 at 5.60 WQ. I'll think about default. He's just a little bit paranoid. You know what I'm saying? Just a little bit psychotic and paranoid. Like that confrontation we had in the hallway at IOD. Papa, papa, like a half an hour after I got off work one day. But how I was trying to get excuses me of trying to get rumored in there and take his job. Just I mean, anybody that's paranoid about Jeff Rimmer is really paranoid. And now of course, I noticed that they're like not mentioning our show anymore. And then we didn't make it very clear the other day. I said, if you listen to the worst team, that's great. We don't want them to lose one listener because all of this thing together. In fact, even our ratings bonuses are tied in together in part. You know, we want to make sure every show on his station is great. But if you're not one of those people that listens to that show, Rick and Sudd are in the morning on the stupid talk. He's what I said. And I said, I listen to them. Have I ever said I listen to our morning show in the year that I've been here? Have I ever said that I really listen very much to it? No. Because it is the colors on air and the incestion. There you think they can stop the dead for morning game and the real David it's just not of any interest in me. It's pandresses repetitive, it's boring and Zelda gets on mine. Or it's better than that. So you know, and obviously now there's another problem developing there, which is going to be his problem, not mine speaking of Rick and Sudd's. Here's a fact. It says, I heard them coming into work this morning. Rick and Sudd and it sounded like they were having a pretty good show. Did you listen? Oh, you didn't listen. George hates Rick. I was just forgot. I was listening to craft workers, something. Oh. Well, you forgot that, but I'm maybe that's why they were having a good show. And Rick only very briefly once mentioned, all of the S&P futures up 12 points. Oh, yeah. But very briefly, he's been a didn't bother me that much, because he moved right on to what I was talking about, some woman that's spunk in the library up in Boka, who smells real bad. My wife was telling me about her, because she used to work in that library. Do you see Rick and Sud hit the jackpot? Oh, there's, they were getting a billion calls about that. Let's us talk about somebody else's real bad. We'll have meetings. They would have staff meetings just about this woman. Yeah, I've known a few people like that in the library. They stuck. Yeah, also don't be playing at Rimmer Stuff. People you all better shape again. What's with default? Maybe the fact that he puffed up and got so chubby is what's to get into him. You know, maybe his pressure is up there. These folks are good. Guy, everybody likes default. Don't they? No. Yes, they do. But he takes it so goddamn hard. He takes it to heart. So radio show, what does he get? And all the fence and inside. Kind of about. Anyway, the fact that since I work afternoons and nights, I never listened to Rick and Sud, I decided to give him a trifons. You're promoting them so much. It's not that I'm promoting them. It's just that here are a couple of guys who are just about on the verge of being victims of the, this disgusting, rotest business. And I have an opportunity to give them a little bit of a promotion over there. Because I worked with them for about 85 years and they're pretty good guys. And you know, as an alternative, if you don't like our morning show, if you don't like Howard with this 20 minute commercial breaks in the lesbian, then here's another, you know, if you don't like a podcast and Nova, rip it off everybody else's material. Here's another one. They've been in the morning, okay? I'm giving them a little promotion because I know the people they work for will never do it. And they're, they talk about that every morning now about the fact that queer channel being a bunch of cheap bastards will ever promote them. In fact, the only reason they got people calling over there and people know that they're out in the morning is because I've been promoting it. Oh, sorry, depo. It's as they're entertaining, but you're right about Rick. He has no idea what he's talking about when he comments on the stock market. He sounds like a pompous moron and it's boring. It makes me fall back to sleep sincerely sleeping beauty. I rest my case. And again, I'm not, you know, on the one hand, just because I'm getting a little promotion does make me think I can tell about you to want to show. But I just, I've never seen that element. I worked with them for 112 years. I never heard that element before. And like you said, he got a little bit of money and all of a sudden he became an investor. And a market is zooming by the way, the dials up on the net. And then as that's up 46 points, that's all I'm going to say about that. I'm not going to keep repeating it. And the futures is up this and fair value with that. I know, because generally speaking, it's the flea market crowd, not the stock market crowd. The stock market crowd are sitting there right now. They're sitting in their little computers. They're, you know, trading online. And they're, they're punching their brains out. They're gambling away like crazy. Because that's what it is. Right now, things are looking really great. Europe went way to hell up again today. The way way up phenomenal. But it's boring. It is terminal. It is pondress. It is really boring. But getting back to this thing about our, the whole philosophy of the, and the sad part about it here at this radio station. I totally disagree before is there is no competition. None. Rick and suds in the morning are the only semblance of a show on that radio station now. Unstupid talk. The best AM signal in the market right in the middle of the dial. They have nothing else after 10 AM zero. Nothing. IOD with that stale awful, uh, marginal news format that they got. It is a non-factor anymore. It might as well, it might as well shut it off now. Instead of waiting until they build the condos and they block off the tower. And after shut it off the year, they might as well do it now. It's a non-factor with a non-competitor with ratings that are miniscule. Is there anybody else on an AM band that speaks English that even, there would even come to mind? No. So the AM band should be owned by WQAM. But the problem is that we have people here who are just interested in vegetating their way through life. They don't care. I mean, professionalism, doing a job for the clients, putting people on here who sound like they belong on here. It's like production. Do we have a production director at this station? No. And in Sturgis, Michigan, a WSTR, 1966 and 7. I was programmed to record their two years, Sturgis, Michigan. I don't even know how many people I'd like 15,000 people there, maybe. We had a production person. I mean, he was also did other things on the staff, but he was a production director. You know, who recorded commercials? You know, that kind of stuff. As opposed to we're going to entertain your old kids from the sports bar. Here you go, Wayne. Do you wish, but okay, hey, come on down and buy a call. Take the mystery out of right there. Take them, my breast God, I want to think a call. Well, you want to say that again, run that pie me again. Thank you, man. Man. And you ask yourself, don't these people listen, I mean, they must listen to the radio station. If I say something that pisses them off, they sure sell. They don't miss a word. They don't miss a goddamn word. But, even though they just, maybe they tune them down during the spots. Maybe that's what it is. That all these clients are paying a lot of money for. And that we just keep getting a lot of stuff right in here that sits in here. Day after day and week after week and month after month. Hey, you guys on here, the air tell it makes magic for us now. Okay, even though you've had that copy since before time has set us and was a baby. Go ahead and make magic for the clients and make them a lot of business. Okay, if you want, if not, we don't care anyway. Because all we really want, I'm telling you, they ought to when they finish with the new studios upstairs. If and when that ever happens. And when QAM as an entity is totally in this building, we ought to put a big sign on the outside of the building. Just give us the fucking money, okay? That should be the model with QAM. Just give us the fucking money and don't bother us with anything after that. I've never heard of such a concept. I've never seen anything like it. Mine eyes have never seen the coming of this kind of a direct. And we've got this one, you know, and they're rotating. We have rotated, they're approaching and rotating on it. It is what they're doing. We got the local sales manager in the general sales manager in the National Sales Manager. And the sports sales manager in the regional sales manager. Everybody here is a chief cook in a bottle washer. Everybody here's got a title. Put in the meantime, nobody talks to anybody. Also, like I said, it's only by accident. The best part of the deal is this account, which I won't mention, which one it was. But this particular commercial that we had a problem with the highest couple of days. Which used to be Gary Sarders account, I thought I just mentioned. Who's just gotten promoted for his aptitude. A sales guy that never even, I never met before, that never heard of the accounts that those from often about it. This is the kind of dude diligence that goes on here. And we, in like I said, we've got an open avenue out there. It would be like if all the other teams in any sport, you picked a sport. If they all went up, folded one out of business. You had the only team and you still couldn't win a game. There's nobody else out there on the ice on the field on the diamond. And you still can't win. There's no competitor out there inside. And you still can't put the ball in the end zone. Yeah, what was the game here a few weeks ago, when they, you know, in overtime, earth the end of the game, whatever the hell it was. And they forced them to do the extra point. And guess what? They went for two. Well, what a surprise, because the other team never came out and lined up. So they took the ball to quarterback, took the end zone. All right, it's good, two points. And that's what it's like. Yeah, no, seriously, that's true. The other team refused to come back for the extra point. I figured what game it was. That's what we got out there. We have no competition. And we still can't get it done right. Because we have too many people in this place. And I, you know, I like I said, I did three shows screaming about it for a year. I got over it for a few months. I somehow psychologically managed to adapt to it. And now for whatever reason, maybe my second vibration's new. That a lot of shenanigans were going around behind the scenes. And nobody bothered to tell us about. And only because George went to Gary Siren, I asked about a particular account and a piece of copy that my dog wouldn't look at. He was doing a done a bloody number on. That's how bad that piece of copy was. He would have shied away from it. Only because he asked the question, oh, well, by the way, I'm no longer doing that on the. What is he now? The chief victim. Oh, national sales manager Gary Siren. Oh, boy, that's great. Well, these will keep modern. Are here and offer this show. Anyway, that's good. People with no conscience are running around in this building. People with no concept of how to speak to each other. And in our program director, I got only knows what function he serves. I talked to him on a phone this morning about this. Well, you know, I'm not even in the same building. Like, like we don't know that. He's over in Sheridan Street. Like, like, like he's pretending he's in Pioria. And we're in Moscow or something, you know? It's not like it's not like a world's apart. But what a great convenient excuse that is. What's the excuse going to be when we're all in the same building together here in a month or two or whatever, it's going to be. Well, there'll be a different excuse than. Yeah. But your sweet answer will be. There'll be a new one, different exciting excuse. In addition to what's guess what the program director also didn't know that we have a whole realignment of, huh? No, nobody know. Other than the people themselves. It's back, maybe even the people themselves didn't know. Yeah, no, seriously. Maybe they didn't know. Maybe you were supposed to have like a, like a psychic, maybe show Griffin would come down from power 96. And we'll sit around and have a, around the table. They'll do us a nobody else say anything. We'll just sit in, you know, think real hard. Something will be real hard. And all of a sudden, ah, like a little light bulb light up over your head. Ah, that's the new sales manager over there. How about how about a memo? How about putting, how about putting something on a piece of paper on a piece of Charmin toilet paper and putting it in a bottle and floating it down to the toilet. Uh, so we might be able to find it in the, in the, in the, in the, in the, Curl it down the hall or something. Greg. You see, this, this is the sad part and didn't I tell you this also. My, let me first came here. It's, uh, it's a club. It's a fraternity. So as long, you know, like that dinner at Roots Chris, which he's got a very nice wife. And we had a nice, the meal. And I appreciate that there was a Roots Chris or was great. That doesn't change anything. I didn't hear to become friends with a general manager or his wife or his family or anybody else. They're nice people came here to do business. Like they said in the Godfather, it's time to do business. Do they do business? No. No. I mean, there's a lot of money that runs through this place, but did they really do business? No. Monkey business. Talk to us. Tell us something we're starving for some information. Like I'm driving the hockey game last Friday at the Mcerwinner. I turned around to you on in the car. And here's my voice coming back at me. Did anybody bother telling me we'll play in the best in the, Oh, Friday morning before the hockey game? No. There is no communication in this joint. None. Zero. Zippity Duda. You people are the worst communicators in the history of the human God damn race. From the general manager and a program director and screw and the local sales manager, whichever one she is this week, you can't complain about their communication because does it exist? No. It don't exist. And at any time, I could come on running at the end zone. There's nobody out there in the field. And you can't get it in. There's nobody out there's no other team out there. And we still can't take the ball over the goal line. Whew. Where's my me? Where have all the Communists gone? Just a short decade ago. There were everywhere. And now there is rare as a playboy in Richard Simmons bedroom. Unless you pick up tickets for this weekend, Disney presents. Comey's on ice. Former dictator loving red tape spreading comedy bastards are now on the ice. And swirling their pink a little hard, though, for you and your family. Watch the Stalin sticks. Junkle their sickles and hammers as they twist and turn an elegant formation. Resembling battle tactics they never got to use. Gaze in amazement as Vladimir Jackoff performs the nearly impossible bullshive 1440 degree revolution. If Disney presents. And comedy's on ice. Employment for Paco and entertainment for you. This weekend only. 32 and 560 WCM. This definitely is the most neurotic place ever worked. I mean, this is a neurotic business by a story nature. I've always told you that. But this is a truly neurotic place. And just in the one year that we've been here, we've had more people either leave here. Not necessarily fairly or be like put in limbo because of drinking problems, sexual harassment problems. What would you call stalking problems, stalking and stalking, etc. In just one short year, what has been 622 people fit in those categories? It's unbelievable. It's like a neurosis going on here. They have neurosis at a liver. Speaking of neurosis, by the way, turn five shooter shot. I saw it by police. You know, about the guy that was hidden ahead on the turn plaque. Between sunrise and open. And I'm reading this article in the Heraldis, when I find one thing, really bizarre. Florida Highway Patrol Captain Jeff Souti, who's investigators tried to trace the bolt of the end its intention says, is this a randomly fired gun somewhere that hit a car or was it a deliberate act? You hear about it on all roads, whether US, state or local roads, was it a deliberate act or did it just come from somewhere? A random bullet. As if we have, I mean, New Year's Eve is over last time I checked right now. It's over with, in other words, are with it just people are standing off, you know, if you see it off the side of the road on the turn plaque in the interstate, like firing off rounds, is that what it is? Uh-huh. Evidently? Now, just stop and think about that. Well, the range cost money. Yeah. So you have to get the key. Which comes you're up in your mind, the vision that there, you know, no matter where you're driving it. Yeah, I like that thing, and we know that. I read about yesterday. He says, you read about it or hear about an all roads, whether US, state or local roads. If you shoot enough of storm, because, you know, because it's, we have that heritage, whether you'll wild west land. That's the American fucking way. Right, that's it. So that, that's it. Can see that kind of a bizarre comment by the, whatever he was, the highway FHP, our poker, Captain Suji. But if anybody, I'm sure we'll find out. I'm sure we won't have any more students out there in a highway. Will we? Here's our call of the morning. Here's Pemberg Pines. Hello. See how how you doing? Okay, sir. Yeah. Last week, I think you were doing the different dances, the end zone celebrations. Yes. And you mentioned somebody mentioned the six gun. Make maybe price. Yeah. But Johnson, which I always thought he was white. He was one of the most light-complexed dark guys ever in the history. I always thought he was a light guy. Well, I was thinking maybe Brian Blades thought he was doing the six gun a couple years ago. Yeah, could have been. Yeah. Now, this football thing with the tickets. I went to the orange ball. I heard Edgerman Hanket, Edgerman, when I left, for the how was I yesterday? Real articulate. I heard Edgerman James on there yesterday, and they was talking. Is he married? Because he was talking about his family. And he had a baby. No. He's not married? No. And he's got a daughter that he's talking about. He's going to sign. You know, he's going to the draft and go in the NFL. Yeah. He got a raise money for his family. But he's not married. Okay. Well, I guess we're not. No. Not the perfect. Sorry for him because, you know, should he break a leg or something? God forbid like that. I'm wondering what he's going to be doing for a living. I mean, he was a... Well, he's not major in engineering. I mean, no. And then I love those people who say, well, how dare he, you know, you're not going to leave a year early in the not further resedification? I mean, I think at this point, it, you're going to make it a lot of good stuff. It's not going to get any further at truth. The football thing would not be... I want to call him for sure. Edgy. Hey, Edgy, you've got no Edgy, Edgy. What do you call a guy named Edgy? But at any rate, I'm sorry. That's okay. I'm not nitpicking game with his sports guy. The football, two last things. The football thing would not sell an out. Now, the parking for $20. That's what upset me the most. I went to the Orange Bowl game and I go to the hurricane game. And I parked down the street there for free on the sidewalk, you know. And it's just too high for parking $20. When you consider that an end zone seat for a regular season game is 24. To be almost the same as a ticket for the game. That's absurd. Yeah. And the last thing, I don't know if you're making it. Well, what do you mean it's too high? They had like 80 trillion people at all. So I heard the, I guess, but they're quoting how the numbers of people that attended those sporting events all in the same weekend. Here was a staggering number. Plus 31,000 people showed up at Gulfstein for the admission was free. And then what does he hear he was in the news and even a live screen? I'll tell you what, I park it. I'll let everybody else know. I park it called or on the day that the, the, the one a clock games for $2. And walk over to the stadium. I just refused. But I don't understand. In other words, if it's that expensive and if it's going to be on television, would you turn out that it was? What's the big deal? Why would you go? I don't know. I didn't go. When it was on TV, I'm seeing when they don't sell out. I went to two games this year that both that were not televised. The thing that was random. Well, why would anybody go and see the rams? No, I like football. Okay. I like profile ball. You know, so, but the last thing, I call me crazy. The beastly read situation. Did you guys talk about that the last two days with the lawsuit? We don't know. We are not going to be discussing it. It's depending lawsuit. And obviously we have nothing to say about it. Oh, you can't comment. No. Okay. Never great. Okay. There's our call for the day. Thank you, sir. Covered a few bases there. Doesn't like the parking cost for the ball games and, I shouldn't have forgiven the court. Right after that, they moved and we spoke about our conduct. This case is the amount of bail of violence on. The motion led to getting kicked out of us But yeah. She looks like it's in. The Sunday morning had to take you to the city. It was a hungrinsore documents. And it was important for you to be punished just like that. in general are a flaky bunch like radio engineers are really peculiar and radio talk host who all are bunch of weirdos but but the fact is I have never been in the midst of a conglomeration of people who have such a cavalier such a bizarre attitude about the going through life and we just make an effort we don't care we no matter what you say no matter what you do we don't care if the spots sound muddy if the equipment is from before the goddamn stone age no matter what it is we don't care I just I can't mentally adjust myself to adapt to that I've tried and it's still unores the hell I mean especially when people are paying a lot of money to advertise on the show that it shows on this radio station and we have an here stuff that that is an embarrassment that is humiliating and degrading and just unbelievably garbage but it's new frequent what there you go and they I gave me an you I've tried eight or nine times to adjust to this thing and I just can't bring myself to do it huh nine you anytime I've sat down and said to myself you've got to stop this okay because your blood first is going to go up eight or nine points and you know oh well five six seven or five sixty pound five sixty at a mobile one line I think we've hit on it the lady who smells now the fact that you said that you're crystal note I mean this is what are the odds in that all I mentioned as passing as I heard them talking about this woman in the book a library who smells real bad and what are we gonna do about her and they had four thousand calls on it and then you tell me your wife knows her not knows her she's a library they know they she goes in there she goes but you don't live in polka no she used to work at that library yeah so they would have meetings about this woman some homeless woman goes in reaching smelling snow though the entire place up within seconds of walking in the door drives everyone else out the staff of course can't leave this must be one of those famous woman town yeah oh she's she's very famous and they can't do anything about it because uh... yeah the library yeah yeah because somebody called them this morning so there was some guy thinking jersey or somewhere up north who uh... you know one a couple hundred thousand dollars in uh... he sued the library because they try to kick his ass out and he wanted a couple hundred grand settlement and also we have these to have to let him back in her all the time what do we do about people who stink i think that's a very very good question because you know quite around here around here that's a question that the perpetual question because we got a lot of people to think around this joint twenty four eleven five fifty w q and real ratches my lover bonds is back and he's older than ever in old finger i could only push trigger damn that i thought it double seven is that it numbers five two nine one two three social security benefits and is traded in his outdated gadgets for his brand new high technology one the spread print act as a boat who should it can take all kinds of crap not much has changed over the years when we're small and you're still below for a year change but this money dollar now the cost of living in a for a simple boy sent a full can arena bit stars at the Russian spy now that's what i call who she galore shunconnery still sharp as a tax but she bond uh... here uh... for which is called me bond old finger playing in senior citizen centers right after matwalk ten forty four five sixty w q and second something only one at service in that spot with a fish on it but it cares about that okay let me chair that just amazing the indifference the apathy the general maybe just me and this audience remember just a bunch of us lackers could that possibly be it yes anyway i did bring in my book diabetes solution by doctor Richard k.

know something i'm gonna have a great day for the lady in the ginnou phone i'm gonna read one thing here from doctor uh... one scene book for you to two on just think about this evening i could have believed it could be brainwashed anyone at your snack wells he says a stunning as it sounds and unbelievable given the popular media's recent love affair with high complex carbo hydrate low fat diet you can quite easily survive on a diet in which you would eat no carbo hydrate furthermore by sticking to a diet that contains no carbo hydrate but high levels of fat and protein you can reduce your cardiac risk profile cholesterol bloodlipids etc though you'd do pride yourself of all the fun foods we create the most fun foods in quotes let me say it again by sticking to a diet that contains no carbo hydrate but high levels of fat and protein you can reduce your cardiac risk profile like he's done doctor brunstein the gyrochids book was uh... type one diabetic and has been since the age of twelve and went to school to become a medical doctor at the age of forty five so we could share his findings about diabetes with people all over the world and has become on the high most highly recognized diabetes experts in the world how do you like that so you can tell me that i'm full of crap and if the snack wells people in the low fat people are the real diet people and the healthy people can't tell you their full of crap and i didn't get my facts from some jackass that called here and honestly on a phony yesterday uh... give me a son of that but all you got to have sugar to stay alive right there you go got to have that sugar baby he's probably one of those guy then keen people and i don't mean steve either just like we had the dog people the dog track people call from naples yesterday with her big stupid not the honest that to in a row back to back you think that was a coincidence now because all the sudden i made some comment about the all the slaughter of all these damn puppies now they'd read them like uh... rabbits by the millions and gasped them by the thousands truth really heard so many guys uh... ten fifty seven five sixty q a m this is five sixty q a m you can get my it works the notion in the basket it makes it all up it works a lot in the basket it's what's the book of the law it works the notion in the basket when the i bought those out for the notion in the basket that it has to hold it out it works the notion in the basket it's what i have to get it works the엔 rather my agree hopeat like do that's around It works in the grass. Or by ppx it works in the grass. It works in the grass. I've got my skin through the hip on that glacier. I'm just thinking about it. I'm not my great cigar from this. I'm just thinking about this whole situation with these people that I work for and within this place. We both have the same objective and that is to make it as much money as possible. We're all in business to make money. There's no BS about that. But the difference being, they don't want to be bothered with the details of what goes between A and Z. There are things that you have to do in between the desire to make money. And then actually just give us the money and don't bother with all the details. That's basically where they're coming from. Now, if I knew how to do that, in other words, if I knew how I could have stayed on this morning and just called in and said, Hey, how are you doing? Everybody have a nice day. Give me my check. I believe me. I'd be the first one to do it. I just don't know how to do that yet. We have an open line at Broward, all three in date. 56050505050 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's a mobile and Palm Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I got a little story to tell you. Last night, I was sitting out on sunrise watching the Panther games. Vision and Peter were all just like everybody else when he's on the ice. Getting other equipment, probably. Yeah. So the girl next to me said, yeah, he's a real jerk. Like, all this sounds like you know, a person of experience. She goes on to tell me that her sister went out with him once or twice. First black guy's ever one hour list. Well, let me tell you she said the myth is not true. How long has that been? He was on like a baby midget. Yeah. And it was the most disappointing sexual experience of her life. Uh-huh. But at least not going on with you. I'm not going to remember. That's good. Thank you. Okay, that's it. That's it. That's what we got for today, boys. Girls have an ice day like I said. It's been nice talking. I'm going to go home and expect to check to be coming in the mail in a couple of days. And that's, you know, that's cut out the middle man. Let's cut out the pimple and middle stuff between A and Z. And what it takes to, you know, to get the money to come in. 567 0.560, palm 560 on the AT&T wireless line. I should have called in sick today. You know, I could have done that. I could drop my dog off in the bed. Climb back home and call you and say, do the show and end your scorn home and slept all day. Which I should have done. Because that's obvious right now. Like, I just get a fraction of the go. Hey, Neil, there's a real interesting documentary on the impeachment and we jumped and I'm seeing right now. You know, like, like, first of all, I haven't seen 100 of those in the last two or three weeks. And number two, like I'm going to just stop doing a show here in the middle. Maybe we could pop that up, but it's over right now. He'd to break the news to you. It's all over. These people wouldn't know Andrew Johnson from Lyndon Johnson from your Johnson. Okay. Here's a plantation. Hello. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Listen, you were talking about a vet. You weren't very happy with the vet you slept today. I got a good plan. I didn't say that I saw today. I've been going there for a long time. I've had several vet. And as far as I'm concerned, they're all marginal at best. Well, they make a suggestion. There's one young lady vet in the promenade, the old public some clearing. Right. And not the old. Uh-huh. He's very sweet and very good. Uh, why don't you hear it? Try it. Okay. Not very far. No, it's not very far. I've been bringing my dog down for years, and she's very, very nice. Yeah, I know exactly where it is. Okay. I just thought I'd tell you. Okay. Thanks. I'm going to put a vet in your room for a pet is like finding a good dog. You got a shop around in chop around and maybe if you're lucky you'll find one before your pets are dead, but it ain't easy, especially down here. 560, 50, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Any interest out there? Any good thing calls here today, you think? No. Okay. I'm just going to sit here and make a sound effect. Like, sound effect. You want to do a little bit more. You want to do a little bit more. Yeah. Yeah. Um, check. Well, don't stop now. Yeah. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Um, check. Just keep going till the next break. What do what's the same way they want to do? We are put the effort in between. We'll just take the paycheck and there's nothing in my contract. There's a guy who talks to him. I'm so sorry. I'm disgusted. Kill that, please. It's even annoying me. It sounds like guilty all over again. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. The, you know, we're on a business here. We're completely posthead. What? The NBA law count has been resolved and they're reporting it on the Instagram. No, I don't care. I'm not a sports. I don't care. Okay. The NBA law count has been resolved. They are going to play a little bit of a season and are going to play some basketball to want to care about it. No. No. No. The matter of fact, New week magazine, I was reading the last life. There's an article 70% of the people in America don't give a crap about the NBA to begin with. And of the 30% of the new care, most of them were didn't care whether it was going to be a season. No. But these guys, you know, they got to put the bread on the table and make their 12 million. They're 12 million and 18 million and 15 million. So they have to have like a little abbreviated season now so that when they can make a few bucks on there and get the heat games on. You know, you notice how they caved and they talked to good game, but boy when push came to Shabwright there at the end. They've buckled a knuckle under because they know God damn well they're taking those two million and five million and 15 million. Whatever they're getting paid, each one of these big freaks. It's a hell of a lot better than flipping burgers at the Burger King. No, I don't care. In fact, I'm going to get that to the New Year's resolution, which I'm a few days late. The six, but other than my usual little bit of hockey talk, I don't want to hear anything about sports in this year. Whether it's good, bad or indifferent, we got 20 hours of nonstop sports in the roast and on his station and quite frankly, I'm burnt out on it. I'm just burnt out on it because the level of the dialogue is just so ponderous. It's so juvenile, it's so embarrassing and the adulation of illiterate jackasses. I'm not saying you got to be a rocket scientist. I'm not going to say you got to be a Julian Bond. You got to be the most American, a merio Cuomo. Everybody has cut out for that. But at least be able to speak to be able to sign your name. Okay, if you got like a real name. I just, I can't get excited about people who are so in our particular this to embarrass and humiliate me. And supposedly people who had like a university education, I was supposed to believe that. I'm sorry. I can't get excited about those kinds of people. Can't do it. Here's a mobile in forlaterdale. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Hello. I want to tell you a show is offensive man. Yeah. Well, it's you. I don't know. Yeah, okay. Thank you. Yeah, he's in forlaterdale like I'm on Uranus. Okay, thanks, Julio. Thanks for your great contribution to what you've done as softloaded too by the way. You and your people. Here's a mobile in Humsdale. Hello. Anya, what's up? How are you doing sir? I live in Africa, I live in Africa, and I find the end of no, no fees. No more raising the roof as they call it. But now can we find a way to get rid of the dirty bird or what? Here's a mobile in tempered pine, hello. Me, no. Yes sir. How close is Udo's car? This is Tim from the bottom. Okay, we have one line left on a board that's in the Broward. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. This guy's got the F-word. We got the two or three little Julios on there. Grabbing each other's members, if they can find it. Which is maybe that living guy's good. I said, that's all we got left here. Boys and girls. As an old, old bee out of business. Where do you find Jim Nendich? White, where are you? Got it. Oh, that hurts, right? You're 5, 6, 8, out. I think it's hard to fix this. On capital hill and far away, Smell a chubby's come to play. We have all the smell of Chubby's gone. Hey, boys and girls, it's time to play Hayden's seek with the smell of Chubby's. Who's that hiding under the desk? It's me! Who's that hiding in hose bush? Well, it's me. Sleaky, blackie. Who's that hiding behind the keg? Yes sir, well, that demey, up, kept a... Now that's what I call a smell of Chubby. You're a... Yeah, I'm always not in, uh, come over here and pull my finger. Oh, wait a minute. Thank you. It's all the 13. That sounded like that the day Halvers Dam, but that we got what's got him, eh? 113, that's 560 WQM. We have two open lines in date, 560, 50, 50, 50, on the AT&T, while it was lunch. We're doing it the QAM way, baby. We're doing it the QAM way. Don't expect a show. Don't expect any entertainment. Just send us all your money, okay? And whatever else you got. Here's plantation, hello. Yes sir. Yeah, a question and a comment later. The question is...my son is a... ...an a diabetic since he's 25 and he's like 40 now. The book that you mentioned, would that be for a diabetic one? Both. That's sorry? Both. Oh, for both. Because Dr. Bernstein is a type one by about a few. He was that better since he was 12 years old. Oh, Dr. Bernstein. And what is an ambulance book please? Diabetes solution, Dr. Richard Bernstein. Gotcha. Hardcover. Yes. You know, I've listened to you a long time since evening hours eight to 12. Oh, God. Right. You've been through this crap before. I think I can say what a crap, right? You can say all the crap. You've been through it before and you've put up the greatest numbers. And I've been enjoying your show for the low these many years. But you know something. I was thinking about that when I drove home. It's funny you mentioned this. I would drove home yesterday. Yeah. And I was thinking about the fact that as long as I've been here, I've been here 100 years. And it's always been the same. It's never these people. They're terrified. They don't want to talk to me. I could bring up 600 different things. Like yesterday, I had dozen different things going here. Any one of which should have generated like a ton of response. They got nothing to say. I'll terrified or they the cat's got their tongue. It's always what they want to hear is hear me screaming and yelling and bitching about the fact that nobody wants to speak. I never heard this such a thing. This is what my whole life in Miami has generated and do is being on your scream at about the fact nobody's got anything to say. Yeah. I know what you mean because I heard you have to be a show. But it seems like, you know, people like myself. I just call in once in a while, but I listen to you very, very often. Yeah. And you get some intelligence that will be calling in. But not looking for intelligence. I'm looking for somebody alive. Other than the half dozen clinics who call 400 times a day and every show in the universe. Right. But these people are all the communities. You have the anti-speople all over the country. Oh, they're not all over the country. They're here. Why don't we? Let's disperse them. Let's send them all over the country. Let's send them to Fargo, North Dakota. Let's send them to the minute. Let me, you talk shows that you know, like California. Montana. Yeah. California, Chicago. You get these cooks. I call them. No, no, no. I don't mind cooks. I'm talking about letter G. I'm talking about apathy. I'm talking about people who have nothing to say, which is this town. This is a boring place with boring people. Well, I'm an edge. I don't know. You can't even imagine what it is. And if they do have something to say, usually they know what they're talking about. Like you listen to sports conversation at a station. And as soon as the call start coming in, you know, immediately you're listening to a bunch of Dodo birds. Didn't know what they're talking about. You know, you're absolutely right. I've listened to it a long time. And I give the same people in 20 years, 20 years ago. I think that'd be nice. Since the first day I came here, nine March, we're first nineteen, seventy six, twenty two and almost twenty three years ago. There are voices I hear on talk shows including this radio station that I heard 23 years ago. Yeah. Who the hell want to hear those people? That's why Neil, so many people call up and tell you, thank God that you're here and you're on a radio because you know, he says that. Why don't you come on. God, Neil God, you know, people don't I say that. Yeah, we're talking about that. But people do say that. Thank God, the Neil Rogers because he makes he just keeps his place saying. And if you are in the way to hell, we would be okay, pal. Good luck. Thanks a lot. Okay. I'll see you in the funny file. Okay. We have an open line at Brower 2 and Dave County. Any interest out there today. I'm going to call him. I'll be the first one to admit it. I'm in co-herit. About two and a half hours of sleep tops. I would say and about a half an hour on the floor, clean up bloody dogs. Okay. That's been my since I spoke to you last. That's been my excitement. And quite frankly, for this time, that's not all that bad when you come right down to it. That's pretty exciting. Better than going to the sub-rass. Now, we spent the day we went out to the sub-rass. Oh, and I got speaking to go to the sub-rass yesterday. And even though I had all the other stuff going on, I forgot the highlight from Monday for my trip home. Remember Monday how it was raining and pouring and freezing and really nasty? And so I have my drive home. And not the way that I went out of the doctors. I'm out over the beach. And it was like walking in ammonia. And I had the blood drop. So I drive all the way home from I need beach all the way to 595. And I get to full-mingle road. And I go north on full-mingle road. And all of a sudden, I get to the corner full-mingle and Bowered Boulevard. And the light is green, but I noticed that the half dozen or so cars in front of me and all the lanes are sitting there. And then I see a couple of porchers, BSO people out there in the intersection, directing traffic. Like maybe there's some big wreck up. Like something's going on, right? I would give you 75,000 guesses as to what was going on and you'll still never guess why they had traffic all stopped. Not a funeral. No. A caravan of something going to the macaruna. That's a hint. Let me give you a better hint. Elephant. Okay. The circus was bringing in all their paraphernalian, all their trucks. The ringling brother circus. I hate those people. But listen to me. This is the Brower County Sheriff's Department of Harded Work for us. Okay. All the rest of us poor work in Slops who have to go somewhere in the daytime. Or would like to get home sometime before midnight. Worst sitting there in our cars getting steamed and pissed off. And guess what? The BSO stand out there blocking all the traffic and waving on Karaban, cut it with truck after truck, all these big ringling brothers, trucks, and all their paraphernalian, they're a sort of bull crap. And they're elephant crap. So they can get in there and they'll let thank God in the left hand. Because evidently, they were going to turn on sunrise and go up to 136 to get to the macarina. But this was like a 10-minute delay. Sitting out there in the middle of the goddamn road and you're wondering, what is it? And then all of a sudden here's the first truck turn. And another, it's like waiting for a goddamn train. You know how that is when you're waiting at railroad tracks. And you keep looking for the old caboose. And you keep looking at it. Oh there we did it. And that's not it. Because then there's all that stuff in between. There's low riders, whatever they call those things. What do they call those things? Flop that. Flop that. They're really low ones. You know, oh there it is. It's just a decoy. There's nothing on them. But they just stuck in there to give you a false sense of security. So you think that the train was done. Guess what? Another five ten minutes. Well that's what this was like. And I'm looking around that the people of the other cars. They wasn't just me. They were like, filming at the mosque like rabbit. Like what the f*** going on here, you know. And there's like a whole bunch of BSO cars and porters and they're standing in a road. They're driving all around. And they're escorting the ringling brothers ethang circus to the macarina and blocking off all the rest of our lives. See, I hate to break the news to you. I don't give a crap about the ringling brothers ethang circus. I'm not going to go to see it. I don't care about it. It's a bunch of elephant is what it is. And especially, you know, you people with a law enforcement this time. You really got your priorities all straightened up. For those of us who are out there on a highway and byways all of us taxpayers who actually live here every day. The best you can do for us is a bunch of guy named Speedtraps. But for these invaders, these these carpet beggars that come in here to siphon out the money from town. Oh, hey, let's stop all the traffic on the road for about 10 or 15 minutes and let you sit there steaming and we didn't piss off and fart up. And, you know, wasting a lot of gas idling your life away. Thank you very much, BSO. Great job, BS. Oh, here's a mobile in Fort Myers, hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. I've got to, I'm dating a girl that's got a friend that's diphetic. And it seems like every time we run into this girl, she's got a drink in her hand and and takes it to the limit. Now, isn't that best for your sugar when you're diabetic? Yeah, of course. Of course. No booze. And I always coppently ammonner, you know, you're always on top. Oh, yeah. That's fine. Asking her to, you know, don't drink tonight, quit drinking. Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I stay down all the time. Maybe she wouldn't have time to drink. Oh, yeah. That's true. It'd be nice if we'd have a sip in between. How do I approach this girl? Well, what do you mean, how do you approach it? You do it. I mean, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them stop drinking. Is that the way to say, goes, if she's going to kill herself, she's going to kill herself. Right. I mean, she could go into coma. It just bothers me because my grandfather's diabetic. You quit drinking. Yeah. Everything. Cold turkey. I can't do that. Well, I'm going to reach you to have a little problem there, you know? Right. Okay. I say dump a bitch before we get the two involvement. You have to start paying those heavy hospital bills. Thanks. Okay. Good luck, you pal. I'll need it. Okay. One call left on the board. I just, I just drove my arms up in here at this point. You know, I just, I got nothing. I got plenty of nothing like you all songs. You know, no energy. I'm sat. I'm totally sat with this crowd. Five, six, seven, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60 on the ATI mean, we just, you know, there is definitely something going on here. Okay. I don't care what anybody says. I looked off to my right here for like, off to a window that's all blocked off anyway. I looked off here for like one one second. We had five calls on here. I looked back in this guy was the last one on there. Please don't insult my intelligence by telling me that there's not some kind of horse crab going on again with this phone system. Please. This company man, somebody oughta, and forgetting about Marlon lawsuit, somebody oughta sue these bastards. Okay. For impersonating a goddamn radio station and putting us in here with a bunch of Schlachar, but, and then of course, the people over there in Sheridan Street. Oh, guess what? The good news is we're finally going to get your upstairs one of these days, maybe maybe. But guess what? The bad news is you're going to still be working with the same bullcrap outdated equipment that you've had for the last 500 years that isn't worth a crap. They just like I said, they don't care. You can't move them for a lot of money. I don't want free meals. I don't want schmosing. I want to do business. Do these people want to do business? No. God. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hey, the idea is doing. Okay, sir. Hey, don't get pay attention to these people, Neil. I think it's the Christian conservative that guy who's even a getcha. He's trying to getcha, Neil. I see that's probably what it is. By doing what? What is he doing? Oh, no. He's in conservative doing. What? Like all of you are the conservative. What are you talking about? You know, like, die you called you back a few months ago. You said you're gonna getcha and he's watching you. That idiot. There are plenty of games. What does that have to do with the fact that the people who are listening to this radio station have got nothing to say about anything. What is it? Christian coalition have to do with that. Yeah, they're screwing everything else. They're price-cooled up a great show like yours. I mean, they're idiots. And how are they doing that, sir? They got a mesmerizing these people that haven't all locked away. Have they had they been their instruments and their phones, too? Is that what they've done? Oh, no. Put something in the holy water. That could be it. You might have a point. Hey, I would have questioned how hurt gold idiot a day. I knew it was talking. I think it happened to subject. I don't want to say if you're gonna talk sports, it's gonna be the end of the call. Come on. Just one. No. It's a commercial. We're on the table. No. Ever great day. I'm not talking sports. Okay. I'm burnt out. I love my hockey, but other than that, I can't take it anymore. I can't stand it. I'm just, I can't imagine how anybody like I said to you. Oh, who are you thinking they're gonna get in your spanking draft? Who do you think they ought to be looking for? Oh, God. Open line of day one and a row. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, palm five, 50, palm five. If you know something, I should have let my dog come in and do the show. I should have stayed at the bed. There you go. How are you talking? Now you're making some sense for once in your life. I should have stayed there and had another zero exam. Even though I was just in the doctor, he said, I'm fine. I should have still stayed there. Say, hey, you want some bloody stool? There you go. Speaking of Randy. Bloody stool? Here's a mobile in North Miami, hello. How do you deal with? Every time I say, bloody stool, Randy Rhodes comes to my guess, sir. How are you doing? Okay. I did. Listen, I didn't know if you saw the article in yesterday's book in the local section on 5, 10. No. No. About the emission control, one of your favorite topics. No. Didn't see it. Talk about how they need to revamp the program and it may be a more costly or... Oh, yeah. They need to be rampant so they can get 20 bucks instead of 10. Now you're talking. Yeah. Well, no one was talking about actually. Well, I want to say stuck there, pipe up the rectum. Those ringling brothers, circus vehicles that were coming through here yesterday that they had the traffic all tied up on Monday. Well, they were talking about doing it every other year as opposed to every year. Great. And now you're talking. Making it called 2250 for each inspection. Yeah. And that's basically it. But they did it. So, in other words, what they're doing is they're wearing down your resistance. We'll give them the extra buck and a quarter each year as well. That comes out to if we have the convenience of not doing it every year. I say, okay, it's worth it to me. Yeah. So, that's all I got. Okay, thanks a lot, pal. By the way, speaking of Jack and a price done, everybody you are aware by the way, that's been just four days. You know, what's going up a penny, of course? Not the sales tax. No. You're not aware of this? Well, of course, you probably don't send out in the letters. No, you have one bill that you get and you give that one to me. Huh? Now, seriously, the price of postage, Mr. You have for a million of this is going up the 33 cents a stamp. 33 cents a stamp. I can't remember the last time I bought a stamp. Oh. Why don't buy a stamp? Very hard for me, because I have to put that postage meter from 32 up to 33. No. That should take me at least one half a second. Grave robbers, you people, like I said before, I don't want to get started on the, again, the whole deal with a post office and getting them meal forward. I still, you know, even my boxed over there and they're very nice people where I go to get my mail. You know, I get it whenever, whenever it decides to show up. Whatever to hello. I don't know what to deal with, and I'm sure there's something I'm not getting at all. But hey, you know, that's the way it goes. But don't complain about that. Just give us more money, more money, and more money. And then we'll start delivering you mail before midnight. Maybe if you're lucky. I want to bang you in the bot, honey. On December 1st, 1997, Kenny G. made musical history when he played one note on his saxophone for 45 minutes and 47 seconds for the stock. Now, you can know the copies that record breaking song along with 12 note just like it on the new CD, Kenny G. One note wonder, you'll listen for hours to the hunting sound of the seizure. Thanks to the Bunker and inspiration of G.B. Make love for hours to the always run message A-flat. And of course, cheer for Kim as he plays the record breaking song. There hasn't been this much excitement in the music world since Johnny fell asleep at the keyboard. And he said, later, he shot nine as in an instant, verticaled, continuously with 12 hours. Terry G. One note wonder, you'll love it. Even if you don't like music, he passes it's not. It's 1 to 32 out of 50 what it is though. It works the lotion in the basket. 28 till noon at 5.60. WQM Hankleby at the show was at Wednesday. Right. He'll be at the show was at the tour clock. And then at 6th of the book, Sean B. The Orangehead. And at 830, we got the pre-game show. The Panthers had Colorado night. They tied the Phoenix last night to two in some of a boring lackluster. I would say effort. I have no idea how they got the time goal by the way because they haven't watched the tape yet. But they water up at the two-two-time against a beaten-up injured the Phoenix team. Here's Hialia. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir? Yeah, I'm Neil. Good morning. I want to bring up a subject that you're on yesterday. Some about the snails. Yes. Yeah. When I wrote a little bit, it's hard to do. Yeah. When I lived over in Italy, we ate a lot of those snails. We had to get up early in the morning, up in the mountains, and go out and look for the tracks that they left on the ground. They lived in the old tracks? You know, snail tracks. It's like a little slime. And it looks the same slime that's on the bottom of the flan, right? Right. Yeah. Like that. It comes in handy for a lot of things. Yeah. Anyway, sometimes... And of course, those attackants with the big noses, I'm sure they leave lots of that smotling around on the ground for you to track. I don't know if I could relate to that. But anyway... In fact, that booker about mommy wasn't the attackant, I think? But anyway... Yeah. So with the follow these tracks, and then finally you come upon the snail. Yeah. And we'd collect about 25 or 30 of them. Well, I mean, like, where do you go to find snail tracks? They write it there on the ground. They're outside and there... Yeah, they're in the woods. They're in the woods on the ground. And you just look for those tracks. And when you follow those tracks, you'll come upon this snail. And then we'd bring them home, and we'd put them in a container of water and leave them there, and change the water each day. So they could crap each day. Yeah. And after that, we'd be saying... How was the snail crapping in the ground if it didn't have the water to crapping? Well, no, what we did was we date crapped right on the ground. We'd let the clean amazement... Well, let me ask you, don't all animals that are out there and the ground are they like crapped on the ground I would assume? Yeah, they do. I mean, don't think they go like a nearest pond to eliminate, do they? No, they're probably going to be behind the water. So let's see, a bottom line all of us. They're just phenomenal story about the framing. Perfect. We'll see what we need anything. They won't need anything in the water. They wouldn't have to crapping anywhere to three days that'd be completely clean. Oh, I put it in what you're seeing. You put it in all of their... Right. They get it all out of their water. We do this morning. You know, a lot of us just... Right. About three days, and then the water, when it's finally clean, then we could put them in a pan of olive oil, with a little garlic or something. Right. And then they detached themselves from the shell, and then you could pick them out and eat them. Huh? And this was like in the toa-billy colopria, down around the lower... Oh, yeah, they're big on that, down there. Yeah. In fact, if you go down just a little bit further, they could have before they even wasted time with it. They would like to size it with a cord, and they were pretty good sized. Very good. They would delicious. Very delicious. That's got to go be good. Very good. Okay. All right. I'm going to go out and hunt some right now, as a matter of fact. I'm going to go out and look for some... Relax. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line in Broward 2, and five hundred and eight five six seven, five sixty, five sixty on the AT&T, why does one? Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hey, Neil, I don't want to burst your bubble, but with all the money you make, and the garbage is just used out of your mouth. Why don't you buy your own equipment? Yeah, there you go. That's right. Why don't I buy my own radio station too? Okay. Okay. Why don't I buy my own phone? That's right. Isn't that the way the business works, you buy your own equipment? No. No. That was good. Excellent. Don't want to burst my bubble, but thank you, sir, for taking me here for two years too. You're self-employing your mama. Two open lines in Broward, five five hundred and eight, five six seven, five sixty, pound five sixty on the AT&T, where are the slimes? But all the money that I make, why how have I got the audacity to expect that these, these leads possibly should expand anybody to build like a real radio station with all the big bucks that I'm making. Excellent logic, sir. You're a genius. You're a goddamn rocket scientist. And also probably a slipper too from the sound of it. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing, Neil? Okay. Driving down 440. That would be like the heat saying, hey, listen, the lines of what all the money we're paying you, why don't you build your own goddamn arena? Yes, go ahead, I'm sorry. I was driving down 441. I couldn't believe it. I got your signal clear as a bill. I'm 441. Well, no wonder nobody's calling me. They're all sitting on on 441. Yeah, because normally when I drive down and I'm a locksmith, and I'm driving down the wall. No, 441, no, no. If I'm on the, if I'm on the, I'll be off of 441, I get you perfect. Right. I drive 2 feet on. Second, I get on 441, nothing but that. I drive down there, and it's clear as a bill. Well, thank God for the good news. There's something. All right. All we need to do is we call, we'll have a look. Thanks a lot, sir. There you go. You're going to be a 441. You're talking. They don't need any goddamn equipment. We have one call on the board, okay? Oh, this is just misery. This is punishment. I'm coming here and flicking punishment on myself for my dog and bloody diarrhea. Why should I be punished for that? I have no idea. Just the way life works. Life is a bunch of five, six, seven, oh five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Here's West Palm Beach, hello. Yeah, Neil? Yes, sir. And what's the point for the dolphin game? Yeah, where is the rest of your material, pal? That's it. Say, hey, no material. Not the little wise guy trying to, then this is that, this is the idea of a sit down comedy, okay? What's the point for the dolphin game? Call up any of the other 20 hours in ACER. I'm sure that'll be glad to tell you, okay? I'm sure that'll be glad to tell you. Give the number of 20 or 30 bookies. Neil Rogers goes on strike. Market down in your calendar. 1137. Where's some good stuff here? Where are you some stuff? How about the carpet? Okay, that should put you in the coma. 1137 on January the 6th Wednesday. Not only six days into the new year. And this audience puts old Uncle Neil, old Fat Uncle Neil, and a good god damn immediate terminal coma. With their great sense of humor, with their lack of material, with their lack of anything coherent to say. Nice going. Sit back, Uncle. I'm still here. What do you think you're wearing? We just want them up. Thank you. But first, we'd better do a little break here, right? 22 till noon at 5.60 WQAM. Want to get yourself a great T-Gar. Then go down and see our friends at Mixed Agares. In fact, a great way to sample all their exclusive cigars is to join our friends from Mixed Agares. The big smoke hosted by cigar fishing auto. It's been held on January the 12th, that's a week from that next to Tuesday. Last time I checked from 7 to 10 PM at the Grand Ballroom of Lowes, Miami Beach. The nice features complemented with cigars, food, wine and spirits. The big smoke always sells out. So call for tickets today. 212, 481, 0330. That's 212, 480, 0330. George will be there by the way, and he'll take all the free cigars. You bring him. And whatever else you got, they don't want. He'll take that too. The Iran scores are written by the ways I've been telling you the last few days. And more than people in Mixed are mighty proud and they should be. cigar insider has picked the best cigars of the whole year 1998. Not just from this neck of the woods, but for the entire world. And five on the list of the top 25 are from Mixed Agares. In fact, they're the only manufacturer in the universe. That's got as many as five on the list. So even some of the top famous names, the most expensive brands like Cohiba, Monaco, the old Pasex and La Gloria Cubana don't score any better. In fact, some of them even lower than Mixed Agares, including that super new predoma reserve, which I got one in my post right now. So if you really appreciate a real good cigar, not some cheap times to a piece of garbage, something really great. Then get yourself down to Mixed. Today's a good day to do it because today and every Tuesday and Wednesday, you go to Mixed. You say, New York just sent me by the give you a 10% discount on all the great smoking goodies and the express Reese 2. Next cigar 71 11 West Lager, one of my east of the flaggers today is the palm of the middle. You may call an 305 266 9007. Monaco, the old RNG was a great big stick. She goes down and gets it at max. More fat, ladies, you'll follow you to A. That's the shit. Are you sick of tossing and turning because you can't sleep at night, and it'd be up for work in a few hours. All I want is a little shut-eye. Then why not kick back and relax with crime-life records new double-feeding and a sound of silence? That's right. Let your cares melt away with the soothing, relaxing, peaceful, tranquility of complete and utter nothingness on this ridiculous, digitally remastered timeless CD of pure noise with sorority. You'll hear so in psychness. And this... Plus, if you act now for those of you who vacation in the country and can't get to sleep without the ambient noise of a bustling, thriving metropolis, well also throw in at no additional charge, sounds of the city. Wow, it sounds just like a real red and fussy, instantly, possibly they've heard them all count. Now I can find the different shut-eye. To order the sounds of silence in the free crappy bonus CD, sounds of the city called 1-800-A-Matotal Global Idiot and all by anything, selling their COD. And how about those diet pills from a doctor's still in two? 17 till noon at 5, 60 WCM. So anyway, Dr. Bernstein in this book just too very short paragraph. So, okay, bear with me all you fat people out there that want to, you know, don't want to hear the truth. He says, so what are carbohydrates? He's talking about the various different types of protein and carbohydrates in fat. He says the technical answer is the carbohydrates, there are chains of sugar molecules. The carbohydrates we eat are mostly chains of glucose molecules. The shorter the chain, the sweeter the taste. Some chains are longer and more complicated, simple and complex carbohydrates, having many links that even branches. But simple or complex carbohydrates are composed entirely of sugar. Sugar. Oh my God. Sugar, you might act holding up a slice of coarse ground seven grain bread. This is sugar. Well, in a word, at least after you digest it, with some important exceptions, carbohydrates or foods derived primarily from plant sources, such as vegetables, grains and fruits, have the same effect on blood glucose levels that table sugar does. The ADA is recently recognized officially, by the way, for example, that bread is a spastic acting a carbohydrate as table sugar. Not like that. Whether you eat a piece of the nutty of a tool grain bread, drink a cocoa, have a dollop of mashed potatoes, the effect on blood glucose levels is the same. Your blood sugar rises, F-A-S-T, fat. Oh, that's Dr. Bernstein. Here's a mobile in for a lot of it. Hello. Neil God. Yes sir. Matthew, don't give me a happy bass out. Happy portal. Happy surface. A couple of things to bring back to Spanish guys. No, it's much more authoritative than it always makes me crack up. Bring what back? Spanish guys, no. You're using the other guys, no. What's the Spanish guys, no? That's Laura King. No, does he Spanish? That's where I Spanish. Yes. Oh, I can't. All right, need more boys. And by the way, last night, the crossfire, you really want to rock the lightning. Just cocking the chanel, unbelievable. They're trying to finally try to, you know, start to open up Cuba and she just won't hear about it, of course. Mm-hmm. Yeah. She will let her. Hmm. Hmm. Okay, thanks, Glenn. Glenn, hello there.

I'm going to start listening to Rick and Sudge in the morning and steal an air subject matter. We'll talk about the stock market. I like Rick and Sudge. I really do. They're good guys. Well, let's go to. Two ways. I'm just going to say that every day is to piss off the folks and he's so thin skin, now it's so paranoid. Boy, talk about juvenile man. Go off the phone. Get a pair of waila and dilute some white while you're at it. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes, man. Neil, what's the difference between acne and a priest? Okay, let's go to the way that was a little kid. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Going once. Going twice. Mobile in Miami is gone. Let's try a call from Tampa. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Australian Shepherd's my friend. Did that spell happen in the world? I want to be you, sir. Where's it on the list? I want list.

I don't know. We're talking weight loss, sir. Yes. Okay. So when you take a simple combo hydrate into your body, if the body does just need it, at that particular time, it will score it back into fact. So what you do is, if you want to, if you take in the combo hydrate, if the right time of day, when you're working out and when you're training and watching your diet, if you take the complex warwood, which are the bread, the right, they take longer for the, even though they go into the body, you sugar, they take longer to get into the system. So the body will burn up that sugar at a better rate than going into your body and turning it to fat to the store, which is what the fat does do. They store the sugar and items that are not being used in necessary, if that particular time. Yeah. And so if you're working with more, that's fine. But most people have got a carbohydrate problem.

Five six seven, five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. We're rolling along. Sicking the song. People are worried about my dog's problem, which is very nice.

I mean, let me ask you something. Does a parrot in a little box like a cat? Where does a parrot? We said anywhere it wants. No, seriously. Rick, where does a parrot do its business? I say I don't understand. There's so many like reasonable pets. I mean, we don't all have to be the same. It's like the vanilla ice cream that's in there. Maybe dogs and cats are boring. Pyrrarch eats cockatoo, whatever. But I mean, a parrot for a, I don't know. A weasel? Here is Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing, man? Okay, man. How's everything going?

As if you haven't tasted, you know, flan from different bakery. Yeah. I mean, I think... First of all, flan is a little bit shitter anyways, so the last thing in the world I need to be flan. Well, I made two for the holidays with cream cheese. Yeah. All the best. Nice. firm, no oozing. No oozing. Nothing went. I mean, awesome. Yeah. And to that guy, he says that you're always talking about black people. Maybe you should put on that, uh, dark nail, learn to sell. So he can learn how to sell. Okay. Have a great day, pal.

And if not, okay, where we go. Here's the... Here's Fort Myers. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. First, I like to ask you for two things. First, because I request. No. God is it be good. No. Second thing. No, no, no, we're quick. I do my talk about the details of a method where you could eliminate weight loss, probably for the rest of your life. If you follow it, and it did support. Why don't you do that? You do a doctor jack. Well, I'm talking about why your heart's still beating. Yes. The key is adding a sufficient amount of water to the food that you eat. And I know that you're allowed to... Like your steak, you pour a lot of water in the steak. Oh, how you do? You pour the water in your mouth while you're eating the steak or just after. Pour the water in your mouth while you're eating the steak. Okay. So let me envision this. I got a big, sportful, delicious, juicy rib eye from Ruth's Chris. And I put that on out. And then before I chew it, no, no, not before you chew it. You chew it. You enjoy the flavor. You swallow it. Yeah. And then a little bit of water. Because in nature, our systems are just... It's the most ludicrous thing I have ever heard of. Oh, here we go. So we're not going to watch you go, guys. No, no. And not a logic. There is no logic. There is no logic. I drink water with all my meals. And it doesn't do any effect on losing weight. In fact, there are many people who say you shouldn't drink water with you. You shouldn't drink very much beverage at all with your meals. You should drink it between meals. Think about how processed. If you've got nothing to do with thinking. I'm going to tell you, you can't... Lady water will not make you lose weight. Okay, sir. It will not... Another four Myers call. Okay. Another guy. He got lost on the road to Arcadia. Get back on road seven of you or whatever it is up there. And get to the joint where they're before it's too late. Two open lines in date. Five, six, seven, oh five. They're all experts, baby.

You lose weight. It'll just melt off. Just like that guy would've had in the paper today. It is up. Pills. He's peddling. Here's a mobile in the highly. Hello. Yes, sir. Speaking about nasty animals. Fert or the nasty animals on the six earth. Yeah. In. Never thrilled. Okay. You know, you need to know. Call me back. Okay. With the fair report. He said that ferrets are the most of notches disgusting. Piece of crap. Let's eliminate the flames. That's what they were saying in Pittsburgh last night. We have an open line in date one in Broward. Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty and pound five, sixty on the 18, two while the slide. Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, now. How you doing? Okay. I had a question for you.

Yeah, I wonder what you have against all people. Against one? Old people. Are you an old people? I'm seventy eight years young. Yeah. You're always talking about old people. You're now old, dear, or something, with a phony action. You're not old. Where's Thomas spoke to you? What bus from the Bronx to that gate? What bus did you get off? I did it. I get back on and go back there. We don't mind old people just at there from the Bronx. Thanks, Chuck from the sub center, just brought me in a great lunch. I'm just a very much-an-ice-at-can lunch, by the way. Little meatball action, there, little cheese, little onions, not too much. Open line and Broward two and day, five six, seven, five, sixty, pound, five, sixty, see when you have no material, you make a fake call. Like that one right there would a real bad accent. He wouldn't know the Bronx, if they said I'm loose right in third base at the Anky Stadium. He still wouldn't know where the hell he was. Even if a pretty print showed up. Pretty going to be showing up. No. Here's a bell-glaid, hello? Yes, sir. I'm calling from beautiful bell-glaid. Well, I'm sorry. The sugar capital of the world. Uh-huh. Did you know that? Yes. Well, I really just wanted to know that man. You're killing us. No, no, no, I have nothing to do with it. I was born and raised in West Palm. Yeah. And I just transferred over here. Like I said, they're killing us. I made a mistake a couple of months ago of saying something bad about sugar here in my office. It's not, they saw getting a blanket party. You know what that is, right? I said it. Also, my second thing I want to tell you about. Yeah. The guy that wrote that song about Gordon was Dale Earnhardt. And Dale Earnhardt. Okay, thank you. Okay, we have an Odoket to Joe Costello all been on the shape. He just barely hanging on by his toenails right now. And if he starts you're in the set of stuff, he just won't be able to handle it. Two open lines in date, 600 open lines in date, 4,000 open lines in date, or whatever to hell they are. I have no idea where they're coming from. They're coming from all over the guy at the employees, including some real wackos they're in a West Coast. I feel so bad for our listeners of our West Coast because the people who call in here, if they really live over there with you, like I said, that's reason enough to feel real bad for you. 5, 6, 7, and then of course you got the bees lilies to deal with. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Just like you see that dinner, you know what that dinner was? The dinner was Chris with Greg and his wife and that whole bit. You know what that was? That was a substitute for, you know, talking about getting an 800 line for the West Coast people for really doing anything like equipment wise, phone system wise, any, you know, ready white wise, any kind of a wise. That was a substitute. Did it work? No. I mean it was nice, a nice social thing. It was delicious. It was a very nice. I didn't have to pay for it, which is a miracle by the way unless they pick up the tab themselves. That was very nice. It was a pleasant evening, but does it substitute in any way shape or form from doing business? No. See, they don't get that here. It's like not in their vocabulary doing business. Here's a lady in Pompano. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I'm a patient talking to you. So fun. You were asking about first earlier. Yes. I have one. And I have to tell you that it's in the pile of crap. And in other words, if you like crap, this is a pet piece. Yeah. So like I can't talk to you. Well, a lot of people like Greg. Okay, she must look because she's got one she said. All the way, I forgot to ask you if they did a, if they had their own litter box. You think they do their crap in a litter box? Well, we'll find out. We have an open line and see it. And Rick Rally saw us. They got first. They just do it right on the living room floor. And of course, after we go to library after in Boca, he knows smell that it's because she I don't understand that business about how everybody knows that woman that the, uh, Boca library, I don't get that. I mean, it's just what are the odds that they, what are what? They're four million people more than that here in South Florida. And the odds of my coming on the ear, seeing I heard Rick and said talking about a smelly, a homeless lady who hangs down at the library in Boca. And then you're telling me that your wife knows her. Knows of her. Well, why do you, that makes it sound like their friends or something. She's the whole, she has lunch with your wife every week. They, yeah, what do you mean? She's like a bag house. Yeah. At the house. Then who wanted to be over? She used to work at the Boca library. In fact, that's why George had a move used to come by the house for lunch and they had a few weeks. A few again. Yeah. So why don't they take her out? Why can't they clean her up or bathe or something? Why don't they put a shower in there in the library? They've had meetings about this. They can have a power shower. The family that reads together showers together. Isn't that the way it works? Yeah. Yeah. What's wrong with that? Put a goddamn shower in there. It'll solve the problem. Get her some damn clothing in there. But you never will cough up the money in the, the fair. He's real worried about the homeless. Always good shirties that he donated so heavily. By the way, thanks very much for all the great articles. All the coverage all around town, the newspapers, TV stations, the assumed regulations over $155 is said to what was their one word. No. Anything anywhere. No. Thank you very much. Not that we expected it. But thanks for helping up to our expectations because your useless. No safety, he just bought you.

Oh, yeah, you can make quirky jerky and then the cross-eyed bitch sits on there. Oh, yeah, wow, look at that. Where's the money, Ron? Here's Hialia, hello. New horror. Great. 1999 starting kind of story. It's, you know, what it is. It's what it is for the song. It's in the automobile personal fitness trainer. Yeah. And three years I bought that whole story with a low fat diet. I prescribed it to people. I've worked with athletes. I've worked with a lot of junior guys and junior hockey and Canada, you know, developing for the NHL for years. I believe in that. When the game James worked with a lot of those junior guys. Yeah, he sure did. Yeah. And it down to you worked him up. Yeah, I should have. Yeah, but I heard of your show when I moved down here and it was just about the time when you started talking about the acting of the diet. I didn't go about the book. I tried it on myself. I tried it on a couple clients. They were really, really overweight. Let me tell you, I swear by it. I do like that. I do not prescribe a low fat high carb diet to anybody. I don't care who they are. Right. It just doesn't work. Sure way to kill somebody. I guarantee you then. Well, I believe it's right. I'm going to write on the road to heart disease with that low fat high carb. It's a bunch of crap. Yeah. Listen, one quick question. I caught the other day that bit with a guy from silent to the land. Yeah. Is that something that still Henry did or is that something you know? No, believe you're not. You'll have to be did not do bad. You're like that. It is. You saw you have a chance. You know, I'd like to hear it again because I only caught the tail end of it. It was funny. You didn't play that today. I didn't hear today. This is Kevin. Hello, hi, Debbie. I'm interested in getting through operations done. Okay. And some body contouring and some liposuction. Mm-hmm. And I was wondering if it's coming to a, and the lip augmentation has met a press surgery phase. All of these things. Mm-hmm. It does. I'm wondering. Well, I need to get everything done. Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my, my thing. Okay, we don't do that. No. Could you do breast implants though? Uh, I can't be done. I mean, I'm not there. It would be right away. The lotion in the basket. Mm-hmm. How much? Uh, 5000. Excellent. I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too. Mm-hmm. The laser surgery. Mm-hmm. Have the lambs stop crying yet. Mommy. It's just me. Don't hurt Mommy's little baby. It works in the lotion in the basket. I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw to be. Okay. Can you make me look more like a woman? Well, we'll have to see you first in there. I'm not looking actually. We can tell you that one way to you. Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts? Mommy? Uh, if you'd like to. It works in the lotion in the basket. Well, do you like to make an appointment? Yeah. Okay. Um, there is a hundred dollar upon the consultation fee. That's fine. Okay. Um, my name is Buffalo Bill. Okay. Let me give you a little information from you. Okay. I'd love to. It works in the lotion in the basket. I understand. It works in the lotion in the basket. Do you want to come in for a consultation for the person? It works in the lotion in the basket. Okay. Would you like to make an appointment? You want to call me back? What's the lotion in the basket? I got my skin suit in the bottle like this. Bill. It works in the lotion in the basket. I understand that. Would you like to make an appointment? It works in the basket. What would you like to make an appointment? It works in the basket. Okay. I will talk to you in the time. It works in the basket. Hello. What? What? What? What do you mean that's on there's so long at the end? What does that mean? You're not going to find it original. It just went on and on and on and on and then clunk. Oh, yes. It's a nice logical ending. Why sing? Now, did Phil have you do that? No. Are you sure? Two open lines a day. 5 6705 60 and pound 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey. Good afternoon. Yes sir. Happy to do you. Happy Wednesday. I don't know. I don't know. Now, I think I should have taken a pull. Maybe we'll do it tomorrow. I should have taken because I feel really bad if you believe that about this default thing is he's taking this very personally and it's business and he's taken it personal and obviously he's all bent out of shape. I mean, Rick and son that worked with him for years and not everybody who listens to the new Roger show listens to the rest of the station. That's obvious. And so for people who, you know, who don't listen to the worst team, I thought it would be okay to mention you're like Rick and Judge over there at 940 in the morning. And he's going to be a group of talk between 60 and 10 a.m. and they need some help because clear channel is cheap and don't give many promotion and what's wrong with that. But default is psychotic about he's suicidal. He's going to do an already so we're at a schlomi's right now given away free hockey. Probably probably another one of his 85 gigs that he's got going. I think so. But anyways, when the call is say we're still here listening and just want to call one of my good friends. One of your good friends at douchebag. Yeah. Hey, Stan, if you're listening, you're douchebag. Before you go, what now what about those stock reports on the recon touch show? Uh, I don't listen to them all the time. Okay, have a go. That was a diplomatic way of saying, does you want to hear him? No, we don't want us to cut it out. We're going to stop doing that. We can't stand it. Open line and Brian. It's just so it doesn't fit in. It doesn't fit in. It's like turning on Dr. Laura and hearing her talk about bloody diarrhea. Jay, Jay, just doesn't fit in. They show you expect here about bloody diarrhea. And you did for my thanks to my little dog. Thanks, tiny. What open line is aid? What in Broward and Hank Goldberg show from Shulaz to a clock this afternoon? As we get approaching that big sports weekend, baby. You're fired up in the NBA. They settled the deal. You said it about that. No. We're not. We're not infected with the cancel. Everything after the super bowls over cancel everything except the NHL. And then we can calm down a little bit. I'll be happy. Talk about important things like bloody diarrhea. Here's a mobile in Key West, Tala. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, hi. My name is Juan Carlos. Yeah, sure. Okay. We have an open line of day-one at Broward. By all the little spix-man, you know, you make such a tremendous contribution to this show. Maybe it's a reflection of the great contribution that you've made to this community. You think there's any similarity there? Uh-huh. Or always hearing about what? That wasn't a spick. The hell it wasn't. That was a redneck spick on Carlos. That was a redneck spick from the southern part of Cuba. That's right. He was from the deep south. Hey, listen, we got problems with your people on this show, okay? We've had a rift. We've had a steak driven between us. I think it's one of those Palamino steaks. We're in Pete, we're in us and all of our Hispanic friends out there who are Closet listeners out there because God forbid anybody, as you know, they go in to that Maddoquean on the radio, huh? Let's take a mobile in Pompano, hello. Mobile in Pompano. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. What's the story here? Any news on that pot thing? Maybe it was no story and there was no news. No news. No. And there's pretty much no one has the something that would happen. Yeah, I'm just warning because I would get news, losing a hack and now for a while. And I don't know if there was still shopping. Does that mean they need to go back? Oh, did that get hurt? They need to go. Yeah. I didn't see that. What's up? They had up on the Panther Game last night. We're saying hack is that injured? Well, I mean, that opens up to do a month you're all again. I mean, you think that he'd want to play there. He's from Quebec. He's a frog. He's been in there. But of course, there's a lot of pressure there. But he's used to that. But the Canadians need desperate help. There they're out there in big trouble. They're not going to make the playoffs. We're about to need serious help. The coaching job there on the wire, too. Oh, sure. The general manager who raised on the wool, you won't be seeing him no more. He's going to sleep with the fishes with the, the, the, What's his name? He'll be on the image of our to the gun. A long time ago. Well, that's the way it goes. They leave sir have it a big year. That's all accounts. Yeah, what is weed? You think that would be to the change in the conference or the fact that they got the curse? Well, I mean, the change in the conference. I'm most willing to win. Most of the list will you listen to me. Most of their wins are against the Western conference. They're 14 to 1 1 against the West. In fact, they're probably wishing they would have stayed in the West right now. They'd have 70 points. Oh, I didn't know the record was the behind the West. Yeah, the Western conference. They'd give, they'd swept Detroit to regain. They'd be Phoenix five to two. They're killing the West, baby. Great. I'll just got to learn to play a little bit against those boring trap teams in Eastern. They'll be okay. All right. All right. Thanks, 3D and call. Okay. Have a great day. See you around. We have an open line at Broward 2 in day. 5 6 7 0 5 60. Pomp 5 60 on the prestigious AT&T Wireless line. Where do you find? Hey, Goldberg. Right where you got it. Sports radio 5 60 Q 8 L.
