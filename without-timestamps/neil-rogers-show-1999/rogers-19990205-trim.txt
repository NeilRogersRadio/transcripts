Almost vegetables are more popular than ever before. And that's why TVS has compromised and whole sexualized to really pricey sports you're doing by your this weekend. Something new. Enjoy a classic love story with a Midwest. It's William Shakespeare's time was tail. Romeo and Juliet. Romeo. Where for art, Romeo? I'm writing. I'd be too aware. If I'd be high-viewed, you'd be at places. No. How's that? Now I can sit and out, no one. 7-3. TVS presents one of the most often, almost everyone I've ever had. I've been home all night. I've come to be the king. And who are you, Clive? I'm your queen. I've been home all night. Don't visit this Sunday. And next week is John Wayne in the company. And the children's classic adventure. Home home alone. TVS, your entertainment alternative for alternative. Well, here we go again boys and girls. The overhead speakers ain't working this morning. Nothing is working in here because you don't want to know why. Because it's the U.N. The Q.A. I can't even say it. I can't even hear myself think. That's what it is. We can't hear that anyway. As the technical disaster continues, I understand yet, by the way, does anybody think I was here yesterday? No. No, I was not here yesterday. Was it tape? What is that? The temporary what? That doesn't work in here anyway. It doesn't work on this board. We've tried that eight million times. And now that the whammy people are not here anymore with a little speaker we used to use. Every time this was happening, we would have it. There's no overhead at all. I can hear nothing. But hey, let's hear it again for the technical incompetence. If you in this room actually wasn't great, but we finally headed down almost to a bad science for a while there. And then they decided, oh, well, let's put all the other people in there for a week. Because Greg reached in a big ass hurry to impress the Super Bowl assholes from the NFL. And they potskied around with air beef piece of equipment that we've got. And now guess what? Nothing works in this joint. Absolutely positively. It's just an opportunity to do round the big. That's the worst in there. I hope you can hear that because I couldn't. This is this is beautiful. This is just exactly what you'd expect. Because Greg region a big hurry. See, I'm in a big hurry to get my bonus check yesterday, which I was out with sick ass today. So I'm assuming it's here today. Is it here today? No. Because it was due yesterday according to, you know, the legal deal that we got isn't here. No, that's just your money. Don't worry about that. But we got we're in a big ass hurry to impress everybody. So like yesterday morning, we had the disaster with the guys outside out on remote, losing line 500 times, putting on ESPN radio or whatever hell I was. It is totally absolutely unbelievable. And do we see an engineer anywhere inside? Oh, he's on his way. I can't hear you. Don't you understand? So you're talking to me, but I can't hear you. The audience can hear you, which is great. Audience can hear George. Which is good. So I have all kinds of stuff to pass along. First of all, condolences to, I mean, just about everybody. It's horrendous week. Our good friend Marie from Wayne Arnold's past away yesterday. Very prematurely great guy. Our condolences to his family. Kevin Kitchens might ever knew. But I knew of who was a J&O for your average at the RMF for years. J&O's FM. And then was over at the EAT. 39 years old. He's dead. Unbelievable story. And when I'm here and you know, this, I'm sorry, but this is just the unacceptable is what this is. I feel like I'm talking to a goddamn tin cup, which I might as well be. But hey, it's the, like I said, the QAMF and Wayne, we just continue with this technical incompetence. Can't find an engineer for lover money. Because this studio doesn't count for anything, okay? It doesn't mean anything. We're just window dressing here. And so the amount of, the amount of involvement, the amount of care, the amount of technical concern that we've had for this studio. Since they're busy parking while with all this other stuff is none. Zipady do does zero. Let the other guys come in here and screw everything up. But do we get the engineer back down here to fix it? No, put it back together again like Humpty Dumpty. No, can't do it. Can't do it. And finally, when I'm starting to feel better, because I finally actually went to a living and breathing doctor yesterday over Cleveland clinic. My good friend Dr. Pasco and Yuck, who got me off at Adelaide. And I'm thinking of myself, you know, I just might be out of the woods. I'm feeling a lot better. I don't have all that flush in my push. And I come in here and all of a sudden, I don't think it's an allergy to Adelaide. I think it's an allergy to this place. It's got to be. Because I've been doing this for about 600 years and I have never, I mean, we've had all kinds of technical problems over the year. I've been through it all. You name it, I've been through it. I've gone out to broadcast high school sporting events with no goddamn phone line hooked up like an hour before the game. And still, I did one broadcast high school football game standing on top of a car. Many years ago, I don't think I'd be wanting to stand on a car in my flat shape today, but nevertheless. So I've encountered every kind of technical disaster you could imagine. But this place has got a special place in my heart, man, because they come up with stuff that has never been invented. Every single day is a major challenge, even though that we're all one big happy family in the same building now, they just can't get crap on the year. What are we doing? Where is the end? I don't know. I'm asking you a question because I can't hear you anyway. He's what? There's something we can try like what going home sounds good to me. Sounds very appealing to me. And they're going to have my bonus check. How do you like that? Which was due yesterday. Yesterday was 10 days after. 10 days after the numbers came out. Is it here? No. Second, how many times did I roll for you going through this? Every single time you see when Greg reads that, his fingers, then we got to get everybody in a thing upstairs because he got to impress the NFL. But when you have a contract with this man, when he actually owes you money, he has some bad obligation. Wow, I will get around to it when we feel like it. Absolutely unbelievable and unacceptable. And you know something I'm starting to get that flashback again. I felt so great. Like 15 minutes ago. And I'm starting to get that flashback in my pussy again. How was out of the woods? I thought Jesus, he's a Christ in Joseph. After eight weeks of misery, I finally got a doctor that had some idea what's going on. Give me a different drug for my blood pressure. No flash, no mess, no mess. And here we are with another technical line where this morning. So in any way, a lot of people I guess thought that I was here yesterday and George has the phones were ringing off the hook, which I have no idea why. Must have been a pretty damn good, the set of tape anyway. 7 minutes after 10 at 5. 60 WQAM. Among folk music's greatest names are Peter Paul and Mary. But before Mary, there was pause. And now, case bell records has discovered the lost tapes of Peter Paul and Marley. How can it slip to his sex or see y'all? He has made everything I agree. Here's your chance to own a piece of musical history that didn't change the world. But my dad, if someone had ever actually heard Peter Paul and Marley. Both the magic guns and your theory and if you've bumped into the John you're probably a sea. Peter Paul and Marley, every song strikes a core, every song warms the hearts, and every song contains the words John and I read. John and I read the lyrics with the endless art of the music. You're just welcome, you're much, just be it, John and Peter I read. Get to your music store soon and experience Peter Paul and Marley. Before it all goes up and smoke. You've taken the spoons of cinnamon and two of the egg whites. I have a stick of butter. And now it's getting sticky all in a bow baby. Stir with a wings spoon. Mix in a couple flowers. You be in the hands of the sun. Say, and about to have a scene about a big and salty and brown. Can you have a needle quick? Pitting me up, just taking my balls in your mouth. Ooh, got to go my chocolate, chocolate ball. Tick it on your mouth and suck them. Got to go my chocolate, chocolate ball. Get a fast photo of my lunch and good for you. Get a fast photo of my balls. What a couple of unsweetened chocolate! And I have a cup of raspberry. Just throw it all back into a sugar. And just to finish up my vanilla. We're the trickiest yee. From the hate with my balls stick. If it's free, he's the other one to free it's easy. And give up for the lead. Say, and about to have a scene about a big and salty and brown. If you ever need a big, tick me up, just take my balls in your mouth. Get a fast photo of my balls. What a minima, do you know? Get a fast photo of my balls. Get a fast photo of my balls. Get a fast photo of my balls. Hey, wait a minute. Who cares? You know like something's burning. Where I know for fun, you know. Now I get down with you, don't fly. Have you ever get back in the kitchen? Because I got a sneak in suspicion. Oh man, baby. Baby, you just burn my bow. Come on, my bow, look on it. Come on, my bow. Come on, my bow. You just burn it. What the wild omits? Come on, my bow, my fingers. And I'll be on the ground and do something. And boom, suck up my chest. Get a soft gizball. Put a million miles back in the second. Hell for my baby. Let's do my job. Get a soft gizball. Put my belly. Go. Oh. Put my belly. Put my belly. Put my belly. Put my belly. Baby. Put my belly. Put my belly. Put my belly. Put my belly. Put my belly. Whoa. Come on, my bow. Get out of my neck. Get out of my neck. Get out of my neck. Yeah. Fantastic team at 5. Safety W.2 and so anyway. We're going to do the Eorogishore today. Excellent live and not on tape. And I have a whole bunch of people on here or I can talk to you. The only problem is I can hear them. So I can't take any calls and I could see during a pup pup pup pup pup like her for four hours like that. But guess what? I'm not going to go see during go pup pup like that because I can hear myself think. Because our overhead isn't working at cause like I told you a minute ago. Nothing in here works the way it's supposed to the way it used to before they decided to use this is like the guinea pig while they were putting the big bombs rush on. Again for the benefit of Greg reading his ego so we could look good. Everybody wouldn't have to put the NFL people out there in the other building and see the toilet over there in Sheridan Street. Here's just one more example of the QAM-lay baby. You can do it the right way or you can do it this way. The absolute positive, bush leg, wrongest way that any idiot could think of in the world. And like I said, you know, we're sitting here with we've got those grass in there. The fat boy brought us with the ratings on their show in many of the hours double. What the other morning and afternoon drive put together and then some. I have what I have point to spare. Not to mention all these spots on the log. I can see a sense here in midday and spider this place. But what do we get do we get even a minimal amount of input we get a minimal amount of assistance from engineering from the program director who goes up and down the elevator up and down. There he goes up and down he's the up and down PD baby. Used to be he's over there or PD but now he's just up and down the old shaft up and down it. That's his thing. If you need me I'll be up there need you for what. What has this man done for us in the last 13 months and five days. Can you name one thing? Oh, he's done for us. That he can facilitate and he can get done that he's involved in making sure that we put the pieces of this puzzle back together again after we had all these people touching around in here after we had big fat slabs, slaughtering chicken the livers and goose livers all over the guy named board and in every piece of equipment in there. Nothing. I just say you know we don't understand what's the problem. We have no idea I guess I guess what we ought to be doing is let's just go out on 441 talk still here us. We'll still be on here we'll get to spots in we'll just go out on a road and talk. No microphone no studio no equipment no board. They just don't get it. I mean when I tell you that even the most basic elementary things that that happened with broadcasting this company doesn't get you're you're you're laughing you're thinking like I'm exaggerating. I'm here roofily today to tell you that I'm not exaggerating even a teeny weeny little bit they just don't even get it. They don't communicate they don't get involved they don't fix stuff that other people screw up and get broke and the bottom of the set is part of it is they don't give a crap. They don't care nothing you can say or do will shame them into changing in any way shape or form. What are they running about worried about right now they're worried about the ratings part of it going to be thrown. They're going to have a big party oh yeah they're going to have a big party to celebrate the ratings which on this station the only ratings we had that we're in the talk about we're here in midday. Am I going to be there at that rate is party and the other thing that they're going to have the party for is now to congratulate themselves on the great move into this new build. We'll just be what a great piece of work this has been. Seriously you see sat there quarter to ten I felt better than I have in eight weeks I was out of the woods I didn't have the flush in the push I thought Jesus Christ that you know I went to see like a real back to yesterday. I got off the antelat thanks to that lady by the way to call me weeks ago about the side effect of antelat thank you sweetheart. I think you may have been right I think although there you know it doesn't get out of your system in one day when you've been taken it for two years. So evidently there's just enough left in there for the stress of this place to like start the you know the old flush again I'm flush in it yeah. Who is that who is that standing in the door I can't hear you anyone who was it. Loft doing what. He has my bonus check oh all of that great. Like I said I've always come to two for us. What you're laughing about what I just said a minute ago. Yeah I said that. That goddamn jackass with a bad haircut he always comes through for us. Like that's supposed to compensate for this you know I mean we see I don't understand it's all ever be time they do something that they're contractually bonded with like the day that he finally brought you the bonus check regweed months after you were screaming and yelling we had to make a joke out of it. And then they paid me money that was passed do for like three months of the money the attorney and I had forgotten about and it was like gee you on grateful basket once you kiss our ass now actually paying you money that we owe you. I don't I don't get it I don't understand that you get it. I don't understand it. We're paying you money that we owe you you should be you know and it's only like a day late and you weren't here yesterday anyway we probably would have had it for yesterday. It's just unbelievable just astonishing. And he's standing in there with a smile on his post like this is there's something I'm using here this is not amusing this is pathetic I don't care if it check if the check is got like seven numbers and yes. Then I'd be excited that check isn't going to change my life. Okay, I'll take it and ain't going to change my life and it would be hell of a lot more by the way at the other day parts were pulling her goddamn dig fat wait not to mention a name. Because that's cost in all of us money to but nevertheless like I said let's have a ratings party celebrate. Let's have a big party to celebrate this tremendous move that can make Greg read feel like a real big shot with the NFL people. Even we walks around looking like he just caught out of the sack from p and lumpy. We didn't even a worse Roman haircut than our program director that fatty Roman haircut you know that the Louise McGill had for about two minutes till you know after he did that haircut that's when he started running around all these chicks put on his big act. I got married six times in the last two months Louise McGill any still ain't full of nobody is he. No. No. But you know I'm just sitting here in a vacuum I feel like I just want to sit on a floor and just there off of the space. Okay, so let me just answer wasn't here yesterday. Sean Burke what I came on Wednesday not didn't mention that the panthers pound at least five to two although they didn't really pound him was four to an empty net goal and it really should only been three to because the one goal at the you know. But we don't complain like I said the panthers needed the game order and leaves Paul Valberius kicking ass but Sean Burke again play just unconscious least didn't look bad. But I want to tell you how dumb some of the people are in that arena. If you stand around and listen to the conversation then you know that we don't have any hockey fans. I went out to take a leak in the middle of the second period. I come back and of course the action's going on so even though my seat is very close to the step and I can slip down there I you know don't want to piss off the ashore I stand there waiting till there's a stop and to play well there was no stop it for like four minutes it was just wild action. Most of it in the panther ran at least are shooting and Sunday and got three or four chances and Burke is playing unbelievable is making great save after say and two assholes are standing behind me and one guy's going. All of that Burke use Columbus so you see that game against Dallas those greasy goals he learned in the meantime he's making saves that haven't been invented yet. Then the game is almost over late in the third period most of the rest of there it's four one panthers at this point and a guy who sits in our section. Which I don't know this guy's name but he's always there who I thought might have some clue about something but I should know better. He gets up and he's got a big smile at the face he's walking out he says to me, I guess the make police are what they used to be honey. And I thought to myself. He's an asshole. They aren't what they used to be because I think yeah thank god they're not what they used to be. They got like a real team this year. Oh, but they played a bad game against so I guess they're not whatever that means. Another typical comment you'd hear the macarina and by the way slowly but surely I see on the news last night I'm at the track channel serving and I get on the news channel and here's a story about they they're showing the cups. The cup holders on the seats in the macarina. In the upper bowl only by the way don't get your hopes up if you didn't a lower bowl like I do and the upper bowl they're taking away the cup holders because the seats are too narrow and too. And because they've had too many complaints. Now there were seven goals scored that game on Wednesday six of them down at the shoot twice in course you could see the one we have to admit by need a martian. Yes, that we could see six goals scored on there did the red light go on that we could see for any of them. No, no. Are they ever going to fix that? No, they just don't care like I said. But slowly but very surely since it's now out of the second half of the season some of the people in the upper bowl I guess some of the ones that sit in those like see those baby seats for people with a very tiny back bone. They're all that. Yeah, they're finally taking the cup holders away because it's just too congested and too small and Wayne's got to squeeze his many bodies as he possibly can in there you don't understand that though you know. So there's no point in putting these people on hold on me you know from Jamie lost that we had 80 million colors on there and George tells me the phones rang off the yesterday during the tape. Which I find astonishing what was that. I can hear it to the you think it may I can think I can hear it through the glass if you shout. Did it really about what. No, I'm sitting here doing a four hour monologue because I choose to do that we have no overhead the calls we hear the colors in this studio on the overhead speaker. That's the point boys and girls I can't take any calls because I can't hear the colors and we can't use headsets in this board because they don't work. We don't have any that are compatible we've tried 80 million times or whatever the problem is it doesn't work. Now back when we had whammy in here if we're no it remember I used to say that I was to say gee that rude the day that they're going to leave believe it or not because then we want at least have the people with a little tiny speaker that used to come. They every in this happened several times while they were here during the several months that they were here taping. And this thing would go out which of course has never been fixed properly and just keeps going out over and over again because it's the be the way way with the cheapest crap that money can buy not to put like a real studio and here with real stuff that works permanently. Make shift horse ball crap. But we don't have that little speaker anywhere we don't even have a make shift little speaker that we could hook up so that I can have like a temporary overhead just as a backup just in case we have another situation like today. So the technical amazement and embarrassment continues what's so but that check that he walk out of there with a re-luff it there who was holding it like a wood like he wanted part of it or something yes nith it smell it. Yeah smell that. By the way way to you they hired in this place and also we have a top of the park spot on here talk about in it. Last night at that rich and I were at the track. We do have a spot later so I guess I mentioned the fact that they're open for simultaneous and Sunday afternoon now. I mentioned that later and they also have that big hundred and twenty five thousand dollar race on February 27th featuring red bow tie do I have any information on that by the way. No, no. No. But I just have to see their last night and since they're my close personal friends there, I thought I mentioned that. Since they're my longest any sponsor, but they refuse to give us any information. And by the way, thanks very much Ted, now for having all the windows on our end closed last night, no betting windows at all on our end in the clubhouse on the sixth floor so you had a way you know in fat rich is a limp in around like you know on a bad knee. Just it's just amazing the way things are done in this town it's the Florida effing way of doing business I've been telling it for a long time. It's like hey you know why don't you just dummy up we don't care we're not trying to succeed we're just bubbling our way through that's the way it's done in Florida mister you've been here a hundred years and you still have. A hundred years and you still have a learn. 1028 is five sixty w q a you know. It's day. You love them it's raise your on tears you cherished in this raise your on. Now 17 times any winning and 38 times Betty Ford residing Kelsey grammar is delving into uncharted territory with tells the grammar things very white. If you don't mind my saying so I feel that you're low far exceeds that which I can get enough of. Or so it's not a conclusive by thought with the proposition as it were. Oh you're no. I cannot get enough. Not since William Shanders Lucien the sky with diamonds and Pat Boons 2d fruity has there been such a torrid just the position of an Anglo oriented song stylist interpreting otherwise enjoyable soulful melodic rendering. Pardon me man but when would be a convenient time for you and I to get it on. Oh yeah my moto is working. These guys think it is. Plus if you act now we'll throw in at some additional charge of pre bonus track of Mr. Grammar's stirring rendition of ice case. Shast. What you happen to be a figure to the knowledge of who that African-American tech reviews for whom many of the young ladies have. Emmer's feelings. Oh yeah. So you're done. So get Kelsey Grammar sings very white. He makes very white. Very white. Oh I really got my foot rule. I'm not going to know. Watch me work. 1033 and 560WQM your dead station for the nine. These have realized the engineers whatever we got is overworked in their hair late at night and they're posky wound upstairs because where we was in a big bum's rushery for this. But like I've said before in the meantime what do we get down here? Anything? No nothing zero zippity do da. Nothing like we don't exist. Like let's just hope for those cross our fingers. Hope for the best and hope that all the stuff that they undid down there during last a week and a half. Hope that all just hold it together. Get out of the Scotch tape. Get out to La Pages glue. Get out the crazy glue mama and just to hope it all kind of holds together. And we could put on some fact similarly of a radio show or radio station here and just just unbelievable. It's unspeakable. Here it is. It's 1035. Have we seen a hide in her hair of an engineer yet? No. I got my bonus check in my pocket. There you go. It's all there. It's all there because it's all from the 10 2 from the show is what it all is. Yeah. You follow my drift. Which by the way, speaking of 10 to 2. Fat boy brought me more than a grab his 25 to 34 men. See if you look if you look hard enough. You find a story. I've told you that for years. If you dig a rating book even stations that barely are on a year they'll find a story. Old lepers, you know. Old letters. Then 25 to 44 hispanic number one. 10 to 2. How do you like that? Now 18 to 24 they hit me like poison. And of course I don't believe that they just won't put it down. We're number 10. And 18 to 24 hispanic very weak. And then you look through and let's see. Men. What was the other one? 25 to 34 which is a good demo. We're number three. So we're kicking ass. We still got all those picks out there. But if you look at men 50 plus according to arbitron. We are tied to the about 10 other stations where they. We have none. We don't have one Spanish. Let's see. It says a Spanish Hispanic or is no descent. We don't have one over the age of 50. Listen to the show according to arbitron. They couldn't find one. There wasn't one diary of one old male spick. Listen to the show or admitted that they did it. So the younger they are and the older they are in between like 25 and 50 were in good shape. But the real young and then the real old. Of course the old ones are busy. You know, down a domino park. What are they listening to? Number one by a mile. Radio Mombino speaking lace. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. To help him put a lot of crap. Non stop. They must bring in. It's like the old farce, you know. Like the old farce and cemetery village. Just when you think you after enough years you've survived the stone for enough years. And maybe most of them have died off by now. They bring in bus loads. They bring in crapploads of men to replace the ones that died off. Never changes. So anyway, this Kevin Kitchens thing horrible story 39 years old. And you were telling you that and of course we can't have a conversation about this because I don't want to have a conversation screaming through the the thin wall the paper thin walls in a window. But evidently he had had hard problems went for a stress test. And when he went home after the stress test is when he started having all kinds of problems. He was supposed to go for an angio plant's plasticist that morning didn't make it. Did. But at any rate the stress test. I just want to give you I don't want to interfere with people's medical stuff. Okay, especially after this problem I've had for eight weeks. But I do want to tell you this the stress test when they you go for the stress test all these cardiologists who love that stuff. Which cost the normal length by the way if you don't have medical insurance. You go for the stress test. One of the this claimers they make you sign is a paper that says one of the side effects is sudden death. And I'll never forget because I went to that is really piled back to the guy the cardiologist that was taking the EKG every time I had a. We kind of farted and wasn't the right flavor he had to take another EKG which built up to build real nice and pause he was hoping open to find something. Because that that be especially. But that stress test what they basically do is they put you out of treadmill and you're like. Coffee and puffing and they got the while come on you can do a little longer little longer and then sometimes it's all you said. What are the side effects is possible sudden death. From the stress that in fact you know something I like in working at WQ on my like it. Work like in working for this company to taking a non stop stress test. Like an endurance contest how many barriers can we place in front of you and how much stress can we inflict before you finally just crack before you just. Haven. And it's amazing how I just did 15 minutes I went from feeling like I had gained 20 years on my life to feel like I just lost it back and then maybe another five or ten. I see our engineers in the building that's a good sign now what's going to happen now what's going to happen next. Look I can't yeah right up I judge is Georgia is doing more so he's doing pandemium and it's not that yeah very quietly that's because I can't hear him. Okay let's take a break and continue rolling long signal song is the investment never stops here at five sixty wqm like I've told you before Virginia. We got no competition we got a free ride we got clear sailing out there on the AM band nobody else in English has got a number that you can even check your thing at. And we still just can't get it right because they want to do everything the chief the beasley greed way man cheap cheap cheap cheap cheap but they found money somewhere to hire that thing upstairs. Huh the thing. Do you know which one the thing you told me about this morning about a fat boy is class compared to that. And by the way speaking of fat boy jf i he was into this morning and I'm going to tell you all I've just heard steps and I heard. And I knew it was him in the hall and I can't I can just barely even hear that but that was him. I guess they must have had a meeting and it must have said you know there's a lot of bizarre people out there let's go out and hire. Oh sorry like I said a lot of those are people let's go higher are you staying right. And they are. I mean this latest addition to our staff which they can't afford you know real equipment they can you know make the commitment to really get a more engineers in here so these guys are working 28 hours a day. But somewhere along the line they have money to go out in the higher. All of these things that they find on the street. People that you wouldn't even let near your home forget about letting them into your home you if they were like within a two block radius you be calling the police the FBI the secret service the White House. You'd be calling what's it John wall shun America's most wanted what what do you laughing about I'm serious.

And then he was working hard late night in the overreof it working on a practice of Joe. It's a massive noodle for an exploding lord in for Monica was flowing with the snow. Bill's the cause of my neck hurts the China. You let out a gigo every time he makes him with your money. It's not the kind you can do in the behind but a cigar and her vagina she's all mine.

Oh yeah. What you got to do is take a tip of it. Yeah. How is that possible? How is it possible we tried every kind of headset that ever has been invented plugging in the Mind of this headphone jack here has any one of them ever worked. I think that's our poor questions for the day. What's going to happen first will a disconnect to life support from King Hussein or will we get the headset down here that I'm Supposed to be able to hear stuff so that we can actually take calls into a radio show. I mean we're all to kill the first hour. I mean, brought you to destroy the devastated it. Not that these people care of course. Seriously how big of a project is that? What is it in tail? What is it we're going to have a head phone that plugs into the board in there with a long cord and then they're going to slip a headset in here while they're trying to figure out the other's problem with the overhead. Why is it that the headset will work in that board but it doesn't work in this jack? Is there a common at why doesn't it work in this jack? Oh it's voodoo magic. Maybe sunny fox brought it over from just that regular old magic. The voodoo magic because it's not like 13, 4, 11 o'clock. This is like when Hank was out there at the you know when they were trying to give him a heart attack out at the NFL experience at the near death experience. When they had a rush into the hospital and we're going to slip it a lot of there on a groovy. Yeah that's what this you know I'm reading about all these other people dying now. Our good friend Murray from my novels he's dead Kevin Kichens 39 years old from EAT he's dead King Hussein and even now he's going to be dead. We're not talking about old old people we're talking about you know living and breathing people dead. And these people are like this is their area of expertise is like putting you in your grave or the next best thing to it and God they do a good job. It's gone great you even know how to do it. How many times have I told you this? So you're you just you're just in denial you're just in denial.

I've never I've been in this business 6,274 years I've never worked anywhere anywhere where I've had so many people that why won't talk to them they won't talk to me because they're just too many people that don't belong in here. How many people are you like even real people. How's that is it working the head said or not. Oh it is working on the way you look there for just a second at the oh boy. Oh boy plug the plug the keep in mind folks okay the the board is in the other room we have a head set with a long Corona extension on it and we have it plugged into the board in the other room which now we're going to pass it by boop is around the corner and through the hall and down the rosemary's house. But that was the idea trying to get even all looking at us. Guess what it cuts in and out. But I guess if I just don't move it it'll be just fine there you go you have any idea what this sounds like. No no don't turn it up and don't do anything with it because if it's any like it sounds like crap. But hey now we can take some calls okay let's go.

Two open lines in date 560 560 560 on our mobile one line. 1056 at 2 a.m. The Neil Rogers show now on 560 WQAM Miami Fort Lauderdale. Why do you first be? I was an author of our world. What a young man. My priest said to me that I'm not a son. No. It's a double journey. It's a double journey. It was a gentleman. It was a gentleman. It was a gentleman. It was a gentleman. Nobody done. What's the pre-entant? After that time was love. You did fall very close down on the knee. It had been down on my knee. It's been a good day. It's been a good day. It's been a good day. It's been a good day. It's been a good day. I want to do down on your knees. It's been a good day. Father, don't you think that it's just a thingy? You're one of the most beautiful moments. By the way, we seen a pretty SHOWNICE EPISODE on it. I don't want to go to the park. Whoa! I'm going to go to the park. Whoa! I don't want to go to the park. And I'm still not a day down on your feet. They have me down on my knees. They were the captain of the train. They said, oh, please sit back and down on my knees. Oh, right. Look at the water, 5.50. You come there, you go, we can hear things. Of course, okay, man, here we are. It's a little too old, kid. It's a little too old. And put it all together for us. But that's, it's, oh, man. Hey, I want to thank Rick Carl from a section photo. I don't really know why I want to thank him. All I was a nice gesture on his part. Who sent me a big bunch of these aerial photographs of the macarina. I mean, thanks for the appitures Rick. With a nice letter associated with it. You know, really, it's, it's a, you know, too bad that they're crappy and not good quality. So, I've never to let's hear you are. Pictures of the macarina, which from the outside and from far away looks pretty, you know, not too bad. Looks like a good building in the middle of a cow pasture. And inside, it looks beautiful. It looks spacious, it's fantastic. But of course, again, not too many things work. And like I said, finally they're starting to take in a couple of ways on a upper bowl. Because I guess a lot of people bang up their knees and his fat rich knows. You don't want to bang up your knee because you can line up at a big fat lawsuit. Here's a mobile and color range, hello. Good morning, sir. Yes, sir. Yesterday I caught the tail end of the conversation. You were having with the gentleman. I wasn't having any conversation. Sir, yesterday she was on tape. I was at the doctor getting my life stream. That's why I really wouldn't know what you were talking about. Can I tell you? Sure. You haven't some discomfort with your heel and you went to a, that's, that's last year's ailment. That's long gone. I'm sorry to trouble you because I had the same thing in the, I ended up going to a basketball surgeon. They solved the problem. I didn't go to any surgeon and it solved itself. It took 10 months since it's long gone. I'm happy for you. Just stay away from proctologists to want to give you a, magnets for your shoes. Have a nice day. And back to you, sir. Yeah, that was last year's ailment. Now we got this year's, which I thought was like all done for the Adelaide lady and the doctor over there at the Cleveland Clinic. She just wanted to about rate your right. See, the doctor that you think is great is the last one you went to. That's always the doctor you think or the veterinary you think is great. Was the last one you took you dog to. And you wait a few days, then it before you rush in they preliminary judgments. Let's wait and see how this flies. Because I said, here this morning in man there was no flush in my face and there was the, the, the, the trash on my neck was going away. I don't have the headaches behind the eyes. I woke up yesterday morning feeling like crap. And I called George and I said, I will not be into them. I'm going to go find like a real doctor. If it's the last thing, I have to do. And then I came in here and all of a sudden that stress factor, I guess. I, maybe somebody knows how long before drug elected gets out of your system. A prescription drug, it's got to be in there for, you know, days. I wouldn't you think, especially after you've been first of all, it's time release. And number two, I've been taken it for two years. So what do you think about six, seven years before that gets out of your system? Here's a mobile and four-later deal. Hello. Yeah, yes sir. Hey, I've been listening to your show and tank and the worst team lately. And this whole thing about Eugene Robinson, I know you, you've, you've passed it out. But people keep calling in and, and I don't mean to be racist, but these African Americans are living themselves. There are no such thing as African Americans are these black people, yeah? They keep calling, defend in the guy. Why? Because he's black. Basically, yeah, you know, it's like someone called up yesterday on Hank's show and talked about drug Williams and said, Does William should be the whole same? For what? I mean, what do you ever do? A few pairs of, what is that have to do with Eugene Robinson? But it's just, it's a, what is that? What do you mean, William should be in the Hall of Fame because he didn't pick up a Hooker on the Skateboard or maybe that's it? Well, and then maybe they should have a separate division for Jocs who never picked up a Hooker on the Skateboard or whatever. I have a separate division of the Hall of Fame. Well, they had this other, like I call in this morning and he's got on those these other. You know, and so you do have a, you have a bad memory. Don't you remember that you're during the OJ thing and we still have, if I were to ask right now, I have a whole bunch. We had a one-to-call last week in Coharith. Give me a song and dance about how everybody knows OJ didn't do it. So it was racist and then all the sudden bull crap. Right. Have you have a segment of the black community just like any other ethnic group. There are people can do no wrong. It's always a frame up. It's always racism. It's always bigotry. So why even deal with those people? I even dignify them. I guess you're right. You know, it's frustrating to see. I would've wasted my time with that. I mean, you know, I'm on the way to the doctor yesterday. I turned on the radio and the first caller. They're talking to one morning show is Billy the jet fan and I reached over when click and I saw my problem immediately. Have a great day. All right. Billy the jet fan. I mean, you talk about desperation. Uh-huh. But, you know, they, they're the experts man when you got to hit that big. There must be a reason for it. We have an open line of day one and a broad five six seven five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. So the first hour today just, you know, kind of, pass it out of your life. I have, I've already done that with me. Cross it out. Here's four lot of nail. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, now, I know why you got that countdown clock on your website. I thought my company was push league. How do they expect you to do a radio talk show when you can't even get called in? Right. I mean, the other way there was one day Hank sitting out there at the stadium. Sick is a dog last week. They said the worst came out out to keep the game. I know, they were off the year, like more than they were on here. It was, it's ridiculous. See, when you got all these technical problems, the last thing in the world you want to do is send a lot of people out to do outside remote. But don't confuse these people because they get a lot of money for that. They don't care. All they want to do is sell and sell and sell and sell and sell. And if it comes on here, it makes us all slough or makes people sick and makes Hank nearly have a heart attack and have to be worse in the hospital. And makes me feel like I'm having a relapse before I had a chance to even get better. They don't care. This company could, they're clueless. All they know is just grind the money through there and let's humble our way through and let's try to make the boss look good. I'll tell you, there would be a lot of suction going on in that in that. I'm going to tell you, there are more. I have never been in a building where there are more naked pictures hidden away in the world. I don't know who's, I know some of the people that have them. I don't know where they're hidden, but trust me when I tell you, this building is loaded with naked pictures. You better wear a heart attack because that building can explode. Okay, have a great day. Goodbye. We have an open line in Zade 1 in Broward, 560505060 on our AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, Neil, how are you? Okay. How come you never talk about Miami-Naddedors? Talk to my neighbor talk about them because nobody is interested in them, including me. Oh, you've got to go through them, they're great. No, I will not be going to them anymore than anybody else goes to them. Okay, I'm not interested in going to see a minor league hockey team when I have a national hockey league team that plays two minutes away from my house. Well, if there are two minutes away from your house, that's one thing. But for people in Miami, the Matagors are great teams who are. Yeah. You've got to go out. You just don't understand. You can keep saying you've got to go out there. It isn't going to happen. People are not going to go to. They're getting less than a thousand people a game now. I know. There's no interest in hockey in this town. Don't you understand that? Well, this is not a hockey town. How can we change that? You can't. You can't. Well, I'm saying there's a lot of people missing a great for it out there. Yeah, well, I don't disagree with the on-app. But this is not a hockey town. So either even all these people that you just like to just got to call me a few minutes ago, but he was at the game once the night and he saw nothing from the Maple Leafs. There was nothing around. They played a good game. It just that our goal 10 was great. Sean, we're played a great game. But these people show up there. They don't even know what they're seeing. Like they got to walk down my section says to me, Oh, I guess the Leafs are what they used to be. Oh, whatever that means because they lost the game. He wouldn't know. Maple Leafs if it's all off a train is backyard. Well, you're right. We got a lot of fickle fans out there. No, we know we don't have fickle fans. We have dumb people who don't know who I don't know what they're interested in. But believe me, hockey is not a trust me. It's very sad to me. But believe me what I tell you. This is not a hockey town and it never will be. Well, I think you are at least let people know that the manned doors are out there. Man, I have let them know. I've given away tickets. I've pushed it. I've connected. I've pulled it. There are people called in the 10 people that go to the games. I was in nothing but luck in the good luck to you. Papa. Papa. Yeah, trying to try to force me to go in the 500 pound bowling ball through a two inch hole. The just there is no interest. They don't care. There is absolutely positively no interest. And like I told you a month ago when they started this disaster's experiment, it was never going to fly. It was doomed before it started. It was doomed before the first game they ever played there. Because the idea that this town would support a minor league hockey team. Even if we didn't have the Panthers, even sitting that aside. Is there any chance this town would support minor league hockey? No. Not a Chinaman's chance in purgatory, baby. Oh, yeah, that Berkish Kulno. She's your old horrible goals. He lived in the good delves. And at the meantime, as these two assholes are talking to each other, he's out there standing on his head. He's making saves the unbelievable. Sunday is out there shaking his head like what have I got to do this ticket in the net. He's playing out for like four minutes straight. They don't get it. They do not get it. I'll say again, I've revised my figures. 5% of us who go to those games. We know the sport. We know the team. We know that what it's all about. We're fans. 5%. The other 95% are socializers. They're pozers. They're people who got corporate tickets from somebody else. 3% of us who go. It's a 10 minutes after 11 at 5. 60 QM is your bucket. Fuck it in and hold it. Oh, the movement. Now it would be night. Oh, the movement. Oh, the movement. I'd do much right on my toilet. Where I belong. Would the pair of dice. Oh, the movement. Finally, the gun. I can wait till. I can wait till. I can wait till. I can wait till. And keep my colon. And keep your colon. In here I pull your breath from this moment on. I don't know exactly where the sea is. Maybe when I said, you know, something to pass. I would just be there when I was far. To find a leaf. I do. To do. I can't wait till. I can't wait till. Give it a flush. My bow will then die. It works for the bottom of the bar. It's 15 at five 60 W to Q and you know, I think we learned something fascinating yesterday. Maybe you learned it. And that is that when I wasn't in here in the show was on tape. And most people were too stupid to realize that it was a tape. Everybody had talked. This is the phones were ringing off the hook solid all six lines. Jen and all four hours. And it's like when whammy show was on. And we used to give the numbers up. And people like engineers might be working in here tonight. Although I don't think it could have been engineers. But anyway, maybe the mouse and the corner used to tell us about it. And they would put the numbers on the screen there. And the phones would be smoking off the hook. Even though there were numbers for this radio station. And it was a TV show that was taped hours before or days before in some cases. phones were going off the hook. But what I'm actually here and ready to talk to people. It's like a whole other story. So maybe it will just play tape. So every day the phones will smoke. We'll ever answer them. Yeah. Maybe that's the problem. The fear that we actually might answer them and put them on the air. But calling a tape. That's what they like. Yeah. They're two calls on the board. That's it. 560 and POMP 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Hello, Dr. Yes. I just want to agree with you about this lady trying to force feed the Matter doors down. You know, we barely support the Panthers. Only reason you got some people there. I just said they get COVID-19. We only got a superstar. But after people there just want to get like five beers at a time. Which you know, they should just stay home and drink here. They have no clue what's going on. As far as I think. I just told her. Yeah. I mean, repeating what I just said. Yeah. But I'm just saying she just, um, no matter what it is, you know, it's always I hate to say like that lady a few months go to the ice cream. They just want to force feed something that you don't want to do. Yeah. You gotta do this. You gotta do this. You gotta do this. You gotta do this. But you gotta go. What about it all over again? With the levels on the phone, I'm telling you, this studio needs a gigantic, variable animal. This is not going to fly. I don't care about anybody else. But I'm not just going to come in here every guy at the end. They all were sudden now because they decided to use this as a guinea pig place. And then play technical night mirror for four hours every day. This is not acceptable. And these people just don't get it. This place needs to be gone through with a fire. I don't care if we're going to be in here another week. month, and got only knows. You keep asking them about one. We're going to be upstairs in that other studio. And of course, there are light years away from getting the big the morning the guy the other studio done. They got people working out of there. But is it close to being done? Not a chance. Not even close. So as a result, we're going to be down here for some time. Maybe in their spare time, which they don't have any or maybe they ought to like a contract to bring somebody in from outside. To put this place back together again. So we can actually do a show not have to spend 98% of our 99% of our attention on technical crap, which is boring in a tune out in the audience. And second time hearing about it. And I'm second-terred of dealing with. Get with it already. Get with it. You jackass, you geek. And as far as who I'm talking about, fill in the blank. Could it be the general manager? Could it be the program director? Could it be the engineering staff? Could it be anybody up there? We're out of the loop. Okay. And how these excuses? Well, you're all the way down there on the second floor. And then elevator's pretty slow. What did I tell you? Used to be all we're all over here in the other building on Sheridan Street, you over there. Now that they're here, has anything changed? No. No. Here's a mobile in Jupiter. Hello. Neil Gauss. Yes, sir. I thought I'd call and give you an enemy update on the morning and Christian movement going on. And Neil, have you heard of the Toronto blessing yet? No. Well, you know about the whole care is matter movement going on for like 30 years. The whole speaking in tongues and two jumping in all that's been. Yeah. Well, apparently about the ignition. This is not going to fly. This overhead thing. Let's go on with a George Y the level. That's not the overhead. That's the wonderful get-in-ear phone system that we have, which I hate. Well, what do you mean by that? This is not our first week on the air. We've been doing this for 13 months here. But it's been, but what? It's the same problem, but it's just much worse than it has. Why? I don't know. Okay, go ahead, sir. Let's give it a shot. That's all right. Anyway, the care is not moving Neil. Apparently about a month ago on TVM, there was some kind of tele-abanguous program going on in Toronto. Instead of speaking in tongues now, they are speaking in the languages of other animals. You had a church full of people running around clucking like chicken and buying like sheep. Apparently this is a sign of the end times for the new millennium. Exactly. So it's pretty cool actually because they've been acting like sheep for years and now they actually sound like it. So that's it Neil. Just thought I'd give you enough tape. Thanks for the good news. I'll see you now. And by the way. Okay, we have two open lines today. One in Broward. 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T Wireless line. Here's Pompito Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I just had a call. I heard so many people talk about the Maple Leafs. Don't they realize the Maple Leafs could a one-met-game? They're almost through. It's a woman for the gold turning into the Panthers. They're saying, what a while you're doing. You can't even have your opinion when I just got to the same. You're repeating just what I told them. To just, ah, you can't a call yet. You know, you didn't have to call me, sir. You didn't have to call. Where you dignifying people that don't understand the game. Why would you respond to them? You're right. Have it right there. Open line in Broward. 2 in date. 560, 560, 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T. They wouldn't know it's Steve Sullivan from Gilbert and Sullivan. These people that were in their Wednesday night. Who buy the way to play the hell of a game? And Steve wasn't that either. Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach, Chilla. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. The sports page and then Palm Beach folks here today, they had a photograph of the kids from Pahoki in San Francisco, the state, and they had a cake. And on the cake, they had a couple towns of where he might be going. And one of them was Bowling Green, and they spelled it B-O-W-E-L. It's about bowling green. What's wrong with that? In fact, if you've ever had like a bad stomach, a lot of us have had Bowling Green problems. I thought you'd get a kick out of that. Well, thanks for the good news. Yeah, that's another thing. See, we ought to be talking about stuff people care about. You know, like, which the AT roll kid is going to be signing up with what school and eventually going on the FSU or Florida or something, maybe to hurt cool and something like that? See, now that I forgot about that. But now that the Super Bowl is over, most of the sports in their time on the station to spend addressing which local elementary school, the Joe Rose and the Donny B hangout in, which kid, which five year old kids got the best arm, and who did this one sign from Pohokey or Bowling Green, etc. I mean, you talk about terminal baby, Q-conducing. We have an open line in Broward 2 and Day, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and 5, 5, 60 on the AT. Yeah, I'm sure I wasn't here yesterday when everybody had lots of good stuff to talk about. I wonder what it was. Where's Neil? Was that what all those calls were yesterday? You know it. Oh. Even though I explained at the beginning of the show, I didn't hear that, obviously. I was at the doctor thinking I was getting this magical, you know, and I'm wondering, maybe it wasn't because I got the red and pussy against and so we had all that stress. But like I said, maybe somebody will call and let us know. Somebody that really knows how long before prescription drug gets out of your system. I realize that would be asking an awful lot. Here's more geables. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. You. My girl going to Italy at the end of the month and I'm just wondering how, how are those Italian today? The end. Okay, we have all lines open and day, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pump, 5, 60 on the AT and T. Where was line? Here's a mobile and four-laterdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I've been listening to you for years, man. Listen. Yes, they got it called you while you go. You're talking about African American. That's it from in your mind, sir. Who are those people? They are black people. I think that's not right to say on the year. You know, you have a lot of African American listen to you. Sir, there are no such thing as African American. There are no such thing. Listen, listen, sir. If somebody goes say, oh, my best wish, I'm in. Tell me, are you going to fail? What were the lines with your ears? What are you saying? I think what you're saying on the AT, right there. You know, you have a lot of people listening to you. We are all in trouble. I'm all in trouble. There are no such things that African surf. Let me say it again. Think of friends. Let me stand again. There is no such thing as an African American no matter how loud you scream. I still have the button. Okay. I can talk a hell of a lot louder than you can. What the hell does anybody have any idea what the hell he was talking about? No. There is no such thing as African American. And if you are dumb enough to get sucked into using that phrase, because the white establishment thought it was cute and clever and politically correct, be my guest. We have white people. We have black people. We have Asian people. And all this other hyphenated bull crap like I told you before. There is no such thing as an African Canadian. There is no such thing as an African Italian. And it doesn't exist. There is no such thing. You didn't come from Africa. Any more than I came from Russia or Poland or any other guy who had done place that my ancestors came from. Hi, Phenated Americans. Baby, that is just categorized yourselves again. If that is what makes you happy, don't ask me no more about it. Here is a mobile and pepper pine. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. 30 days. 30 days for drug to get out of your system. Really? Really. For prescription drug to get out? Any type of drug. Anything from anything that is above an aspirin or a Tylenol? Oh my god. 30 days? 30 days. Just like pot or coke or any of that sort of stuff. 30 days. How about protein? The only thing you can do is try to get lots of fluids and try flushing it out as a flushing toilet. Okay, I am going to take advantage of that. That should help flushing it out, right? Lots of water. Okay, I am going to go pee right now. Thank you. Okay, so in other words, I am just bringing a bag in here. I am not even a bag. It is a big bucket. You are going to plus to waste that. How does there something that rhymes with bucket and just bring a big bag in here? It is squirt squirtying it all day. Give it a flush it out of my system. When it does not flush it out, that is our model for the 90s. Baby, when it does, what is it out? 30 days. Jesus Christ. In other words, there is just going to be a little, all the way. You know, make tremendous progress. I don't have all that pain behind my eyes. And the headaches. And I really thought like, you know, you get a little bit of an ante. A little bit anxious. You want an instant miracle. Just like everybody else out there. Hello. Mobile and Hollywood. Yeah, it is not 30 days. It is 20 days. It is one. Except of metabolizing your system this two days. Two days. 14 hours. Excellent. So just in time for the weekend, I should be doing great. Great. Thanks. Thank you. Oh, there you go. Now I feel better. All right. Let's have a goddamn party in our pants. Okay. Two days. Thirty days. That is just a little bit ridiculous, you know. 26 after 11 and 560 W to QMP. And you're a little bit tired. Are you a whass dude? Roll. Your neck will come to you. The magic pot. What's other men is where I feel. The magic pot. And my guitar. And my guitar. I sometimes stare. The magic pot. I like his walking. I like his hair. The magic pot. I watch his face. The magic pot. I watch his jeans. When he's drunk. The magic pot. The magic pot. I just love his magic pot. The magic pot. When we're on tour. I just hope. The magic pot. You lose his grip and drop the soul. The magic pot. The magic pot. I see my hair on. I see my hair on. You can't have it. I'm not your son. I'm drunk. I want 31 to 5. I want to make it. Let me go. The panters at Pittsburgh. The panters at the Penguins. We can. The cat is the same. The panters at the Penguins. The cat is a life in death. The cat is a life in death. The cat is a fat. The cat is a fat. The cat is a fat. for commercial which I've seen this by the way. Have you seen a while with the rotisserie oven for your chickens and ducks? No, or can we get one? It says they're cooking ribstakes, chicken, etc. And the thing comes with a metal wire basket enclosure for flat meats and filet, like filets and hamburgers. So we go to the salmon steaks and he says, put the salmon in the basket. Yeah, Ron Popeye also says put the salmon in the uh... It works the lotion in the basket. Nice going, Ron. And put the money in your pocket. That Ron Popeye, a good guy. Help tell you it's a bunch of crap. And it is a bunch of crap in your pocket. How about that? My favorite though is the one where you could like a dry your own weed in a test code. But the a trays? Yeah, that's good. The Ron Co. Dry your own weed and seed uh... tray thing. That's what they call it. The seed tray thing. Also by the way, the book fair while the god by Charles Templeton is available on amazon.com, which we already knew that but somebody facts. And it says average customer review five stars. The only problem is there's only one review. So... Well, I mean whoever made the review has to feel very important. A reader from Victoria Canada, January 2nd 1999 says, as a person raises a Christian suffering doubts about my faith. This book was very insightful. It confirmed a lot of what I believe in the office arguments are clearing compelling. I liked it very much. There you go. Amazon.com. Fair while the god by Charles Bradley Templeton, which is your Neri price list price is 2999. You get it for 2999 on the internet. You do realize that one of the reasons that all these internet stocks, I don't want to start stock market talk. But one of the reasons that all those stocks are going to the roof is because we do have this whole new marketplace that's developing. And if you're going to be like out of touch with reality, you're going to miss out. Because you're going to be buying and you're going to be selling. You're going to be doing like 80% of your life is going to be there on the internet. I wonder you're like it or not. Here's a mobile implantation. Hello. Hello, deal. Yes sir. First let me see you doing the hell of a job. Yeah, under the circumstances right. All right. I just want to ask you the told jury full of thing. I haven't been listening for that long. Have you talked about this at all? Yes. The fact that he said a white Jewish man is making a price. Right. Right. I mean, what does they're just saying? We know he's an anti-Sem. I'm with that big fat bulbous support. How do you know how much of our vision of going? I come on my hearing about it that much. I come to his very first on it. And wouldn't the anti-Christ according to the traffic religion be a black Jewish woman? Yes. Right. Florence from all of it from all Jeffersons. Right. Right. I just want to know why we're not hearing any press about it because if you want to say it was a black man. I think it's that as that is night. Well, it just makes me sick now. Okay. Have a great day sir. Make some sick. I mean, why you surprised these people are anti-Semites. They're anti everybody. You all get a burden in hell. I mean, this is not not a new revelation. Just that he was very clumsy in a way. He said it and he tried to backpettle it backtrack. But even though he said he doesn't, you know, he doesn't this of how what he said he just shouldn't have said it. He's still believes it. That the anti-Christ is going to be some Jewish guy who's got a radio show somewhere, probably like in Seattle. I think that Mike Seagull is probably the anti-Christ. You know? Uh-huh. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, how are you doing? Okay, sir. I was at the New Oil House today. I was in the Panther game by more planning weeks. Yeah, and we were at what? The Oil House. New one. Watching the Panther game. They were playing the Panther game at the oil. Yeah, I'll be right. Yeah, I'm like. We do it. This uh, sports flash came out. That some guy in Anchorage got arrested for cost checking and a minor league team. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He would do it. What nuts? He took a stick in the minor league. You know the attack the guy assaulted the uh, other kid and they arrested him. Uh, they know you haven't ever watched your TV. You know, you should be watching sports and around a clock they showed it six million times. Yeah, I've been working with you. All right. Thanks. Okay, pal. Yeah, you know, and of course a lot of the stick work that goes on in the NHL. Not just in the minor league. They have no respect for each other. They do all kinds of grow test things. Like Paul Laws got heistick by Mike Johnson. They're which the referee didn't see that. The worst officiated game in history. Not that I'm using that as an excuse either way because they were bad all the way around. Including when the net came off and they'd let Whitney and Burai go down the ice and score that goal. But uh, yeah, don't confuse uh, Terry Gregson with a phased 100 years old Jim a break. We have an open line in date. 5 6705 60 and pound five 60 on the 18 T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Naples. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir. Listen, a couple things. First of all, I agree with you totally. There is no such thing. Affirmative African American, you're either African American, American, Canadian, Irish, whatever. But you're not. If you're black, you're black. What's wrong with the word black? If we want to label or identify people, what's wrong with black? Well, obviously not because February is what black history must run African American history. Right, very excellent point. Very good. And uh, the second point is uh, you were talking about uh, the madadors. We have a, we have a East Coast hockey team over here, the Florida Everblades. They draw a great crowd. But I got to agree with you. The Panthers or came like that, uh, or the, uh, the lightning ring this area. There, there wouldn't be more than a thousand people at the games. Do you remember the thousand people at lightning games right now? That's very true. Pretty close. I'm not, I'm maybe three, four thousand is what they're really getting. They're drawing, uh, they're drawing about five, anywhere five to seven thousand a game over here. Um, but it's like, but you're missing the point. See, well, you understand is this. If we had no Florida Panthers, if there was no NHL team here at all, minor league hockey is never ever going to make it in this town. And it's not a hockey town. Right. Absolutely. Thanks, though. Okay, everything. So you try to compare over there on a West Coast where there are a lot of people from the Midwest who are hockey fans, even in Tampa, up until the team just totally disintegrated, which they never would have been very good. But they just finally said, screw it. We can't handle it. I mean, it could be 10 to one a couple of nights ago by Washington. Who now? Who? And if the lightning were playing here, would there be anybody going to those games here? No. Of course not. Who would go to that swirl even the socializing after while getting pretty stable? But this is just not and believe me. It pains me to say it. But if you just hang around in that arena, that's what I should do instead of sitting in my seat. I should just wander around and listen to the in-a-in conversation going on. From people who are sitting there, and even the ones who are pretending to be watching, and they still haven't got any idea what they're seeing. Got it, that first reading. Just dumb, dumb, stupid comments. I'm surprised they were, you know, not to disappointed we got Pavelle Burry. They want Peter Warl back. Two open lines in date, 560505060 and Pant560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. 22 till noon at QAM. You're looking at 10 inches. As Brought to Q-to, for the fright. You're like a nothing from the O-3 fright. A pleasant anus to find anything. My planet who ligh in in these wings. What's your problem, Kenny? Stop. Don't you think you've gone too far? Everybody, thank you. I'm like Joseph McCarthy. If you know that Joseph McCarthy was gay, the kind of life you can't accept, he never bays. Be kept dry cold, most fire is dying. Until he got fire, when stroke and die. What's your problem, Kenny? Stop. If you've added words to our own guns, we would want to take you on like Joseph McCarthy. We breathe, we breathe, we breathe, all right. We breathe, we breathe, all right. 43 at 5.60. WQM here's a factory sound. He said he just finished a call with a panther's spoke with a guy named John. He's still complaining about the shoot twice goal. The excuse now is a bigger life would have struck the view of the people in the lower bowl. What about the people in the panthers own lower bowl, he has. Reply, silence. So I suggest it. Why not use the same life to make a visible wall. Reply, thank you for the call. Click. See, they don't know how to do it. See, I thought that they just didn't give a crap. They don't know how to do it. They built a $200 popular hockey arena and they don't know how to put up the goal lights so that everybody's sitting in there can see it. The only hockey arena in the world at any level, college, minor league, little league, shinny hockey, the only hockey venue in the universe where they can't figure out how to have the goal out of the green life to see it. God. Also speaking to people that can't figure it out, sand the man, Sam our promotion man will be between noon and one of the pizza loft. Ask me why. I really don't know. Over the pizza loft in David just out of the 595 in the university drive, because I guess Jeff Cohen needs more publicity, nor for a QM fan. We'll have tickets for the World Caribbean Senior PGA Tour, Crandon Park and Kiba's Game this weekend. By the way, let me tell you how much I love golf, okay? Also for the Joe DeMaggio Legends game at four Lodderdale Stadium, benefit the Joe DeMaggio Children's Hospital, tickets for the coconut growth home show this weekend at the Coconut World Convention Center and the new I-Turn Eagle on WQM T-shirts between noon and one at the pizza loft in David. Go buy and take a look at Sam and just do life your ass off. Say why you guys doing this? And I'll say, I don't know. Gotta do something. Here's a lady in the plantation. Hello. Hello. Yes man. Hi Neil. This is the one that called you at the Adelaide. Right. To go off of it. Right. Okay. So I just called my pharmacist and he said that it could take, it depends how long you've been on it. If you did on it. Two years. Okay. Then he said the one you've been on at the longer it takes to get out of your system. Oh. Because you're a blood level. But he did it. And especially because it's time release. So it's, uh, right. And he said it should only take the days. It's not like, you know, two or three or whatever. Right. It'd be like a week or anything like that. Oh. But the one you've been on at the longer it takes to get out of your system. I got such a panic this morning when we had all this technical crap at 10 o'clock and I was sitting here feeling so great and this slush made a comeback. But was it really bad when he came back or as bad as it was yesterday? No. No. But it's still there. So it's still there. Well, I guess it's going to take time. I just hope that's what it is. Well, that's what my doctor says. That's what he said. I mean, if it turns out not to be, I mean, I'm just, uh, you know, going to go on by a shotgun. Well, with me, it didn't take that one to get out of my system because I wasn't on it that long. Well, how long did it take for the symptoms to go away? Not that long. Like a day or like a day. And a day day was on. But I was only on it. Like, they always on a different medication in the same family. And that did it to me after like four weeks. So I switched to the Adelaide and it made my symptoms worse. So they took me off those, that family of drugs completely. So I just hope you've not put you on another one that's the same thing. But I don't think so. No. You'll know better. Okay. Thanks a lot. I hope you feel better. Appreciate it. Okay. Bye. Okay. We have one call after the board. Then we go to us some really great music. 560560 and Pond 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in a mockery. Hello. Daniel. You want to welcome all the other caucus. They're playing in the out the Cockaroa, Caribbean Classic this weekend. I got more people watching me play Niti to go. And we'll be watching them play real golf. Did you guys at the TV office? Deep home West Palm Beach last week was a ghost town. Nobody watched in golf. This is not even a golf town. And by the way, thank God for that. What else should they be watching golf? What kind of a no-life person watches golf? Ladies, cops. Please, they've been though. We can watch something. Yeah, if you like bull-like butt. Yeah. Hey, how about Tim McCarbuk getting fired by the New York man? The guy can't even tell you what done his mind. They're all great. They want to steal on Fox because Fox rhymes with Fox. Fox rhymes with Fox and have a great day getting a new phone. Now I can't hear them very much. We have an open line in Broward, all three in date. 560560, Pond 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello? Yes, sir. No, I'll bet the light in the hockey. I mean, it's the goal. It's the puckers in the net. We need a light for it. Well, let me ask you something, sir. Can you always see that? Does it the puck went over to Broward line? Are there questions? It's situations where you can't see that? No, I mean, it's the puckers in the net. There you go. In the net. In the net. No, no, we're a situation where you can't see the puck going in the net. No, if you're a true fan, you're watching the puck behold. If you're a true fan, if you're shouldn't, like maybe 150 yards away from the goal, you can see what if you're even to be can't see the goal light. How about the other shouldn't weigh down at the shoe once in? And they can't see the goal light in the lower goal. How about them? Well, how about you watching TV on the big score board? Yeah, and what if the TV doesn't have it up there in addition to which you can't always see the goal on on TV? Jack asked, here you go. This was the best. This was the best. Here's a guy I want to get an argument with me arguing in favor of the fact that they've got a screwed up over there. They spent $200 million of public funds. And this guy's trying to tell me if you're a fan, you can see the puck going in it. And usually you can, if you're sitting in a right place, like I am. But there's sometimes when you can't. Sometimes it's very, very close when a puck just trickles over the line or it's behind the goal and you can't see. Is the on it as it behind them? That's called really putting on a professional sporting event. I mean, the idea that there's anybody in this town who would justify this makes my case. Maybe I have to say nothing else about what a bogus sports town this is. Yeah, what a hoist should you just be after seeing the goal like go on on? You're asking for too much man. You're just making trouble. And by the way, give way to kiss good night tonight, okay? Oh, it's picking a Wayne. I had the big news of the week. I haven't even told us because it was out yesterday. I don't want to say these are rumors. These are more than rumors, but you know, the whole thing two weeks ago with Jimmy Johnson, and the press conference, and all that crap we went through, the real story that's circulating around town is very heavily. And we had a couple of people called it and speculate that this and it looks like they were right. That Jimmy Johnson went to Wayne and said, I want Dave Wands that and Wayne said, No. And they got into a heated discussion about that and Wayne still said, No, and Jimmy, a tourist knit and got ahold of the media people and planted the whole deal and orchestrated this whole thing. So naturally, it had to be resolved in a way where we'd Wayne look like the hero by saving, you know, he brings in Dave Wands that and Jimmy's, you know, we want him to stay and he saved the franchise. But in the meantime, what the stories are saying is that the volume is matter and hell, Jimmy Johnson. Because he used this as leverage to force him to bring in Dave Wands that which Wayne originally said, No, and this isn't just the rumor, this is a, that's the MS. So I like I've told you so many times before, just like when Shula got canned, you know, they had to present in such a way because it would have been very insulting and it wouldn't have been acceptable. And this time to say we can't advance. Two open lines in date, five six seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T line. Here's Jupiter, hello. Does Henry high would say put the motion in the basket. Yeah, okay. Open line of Broward to and date five six seven, five, sixty and pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Use the material from three weeks ago, very good. Here's Bokeh, hello. Hi, Neil, how are you? Okay. What did Jimmy Johnson do? I mean, are we any better off than we were three years? I don't want to discuss Jimmy Johnson. I'm just telling you what the real story is because the other people are giving you some of the damage. The other thing, Neil, is any trick to the rumor that QA will be broadcast in Hurricane Game Detective next year of the year after? Supposedly. Right. Well, it's hoping for some of your research back because Dave LaMont heard of me at the night in Radio. Well, now why would you say let's hope they bring some of your research back? Do you or Dave LaMont? I do or Dave LaMont? I know, Dave LaMont is a screamer. I don't want Dave LaMont. What's wrong with bringing out like people are really a professional sportsgast is? I think that's the biggest chance. Hi. Who should have a chance? Dave O'Brien wants to do some of you in basketball understand who Dave O'Brien's great. Why doesn't it have to be the same old retread people? I mean, you know, sunny is not a bad guy, but sunny is certainly not a great sportscaster. Well, he's a little better than who's the Ken Maldon. I mean, I thought like Pat Summerhol sometimes watching the game. Ken Maldon's not doing the games. What are you talking about? So about his updates. Give me a second. Ken Maldon is great. Ken Maldon, you're not Ken Maldon, sir. You're off the show. You have to step over my body and I Ken Maldon is a great guy. Okay. The fact is 110 years old, he can't help that. We're all getting old. We have an open line in Dave 560 and Tom 560 on the AT&T line. But this guy wants sunny. He wants sunny back on the ball game. Here's a mobile and four-laterdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. First of all, this is not a sports town. Right. Okay. That's why everybody's repeating back to me. Things have been same for 20 years. All that. Neil, what do you have against these dams? Red these guys up. That watch over the waterways. Open line of Dave 1 at Broward 560 and Tom 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's color-raid, Jello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. Yeah, I'm with the guy who got the goal. It's some second tire here and you cry about it every day. I'm a little bit don't listen. Okay. Because I'm going to be the one. I'm going because it does bother me. If I'm the only person in there and believe me, I know a few other people that are psychotic about it too. I'm going to keep banging away on behalf of other people who might care. Okay. And if it's terminal to you, top crab. If it's too bad, I take a minute or two to mention it. Even if I do it every day, tough. Find something else to fill up your four empty hours in the middle of your day. Okay, pal. Because one thing I always respond to real well is people who call in like you to tell me what to say. I want to talk about it. I respond real well to that. Don't I? No. He's getting real tired. He agrees with the other guy. I got a real a radical solution. Okay. Let him fix it. Wow. Let him let him call up somebody in a real hockey arena. Find out how you do it right and make it right. Then you'll never hear about it again. And of course, if I'm so wrong about all things that are screwed up in here, how come they're finally now removing the removing those stupid uh cup holders from the goddamn aback of the seat in the upper bowl. And before long, they'll probably be screaming about having to do it in the lower bowl. Because they did a lot of things wrong. They made a lot of mistakes. Okay. And when you go to a sporting venue, it should be like for the enjoyment of the people who are spending the money, or going into a subsidized and support whatever's going on there. Not just this kind of thing. Well, you know, if you don't like it, uh, don't come back, you know. See what they show I can say that because you got other choices and it doesn't cost you anything. And you don't have to go anywhere. You can sit in your car and your home on your ass to turn on a radio. If you like it, fine. If not, that's okay. But the idea that people have to make an effort. They have to pay an arm and leg to park. They paid a lot of money for the tickets or somebody did. And oh, well, that's a, we're sorry. We just can't do it right. Great. Here's a mobile implantation. Hello. Yeah. You know. Yes, sir. Hey, buddy. I grew up down here. So not, uh, real knowledgeable. I'm hockey is if someone who might have played it as a youth up north. But can you tell me how the off-site works? I'm not. I really get to figure that out. No. Open line at Broward. 560 and 560 and 560 on the AT&T world. By the way, when you find your birthday cakes, you're just like the icing off it. You'll understand. Just look at it. Okay, whatever that was. Open line and date 560 and 560 and 560 on the AT&T world. Let's line another one of your dumbest picks. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, me, Neil. Yes, sir. Neil, I'm not a proof. Do you need to be very stupid or naive? Well, you'll figure right in then. You tell me what the put solution in the basket means. Open line and date 1 in Broward. 560 and 560 and 560. No, see, we enjoy the fact that there are people who don't enjoy it. I don't, uh, get it. That don't understand it, either. Wow. Boy, sure makes me feel bad that I took off yesterday to go to the doctor. Maybe put my life back together again. Which I'm not really sure. I thought boy, I was out of the woods. I thought I was in a hog haven't here. There's just a little bit of this fire in the puts again here today. Of course, if you've heard from the beginning, I'll show you might just understand why. Here's a mobile in Hellendale. Hello. How you doing? Okay. I was in my car driving around. I heard that horses asked say something about why should they turn the light on when someone scores. Yeah, why do you have to see the goal? Right. If this is the most ass-enine common, I have heard in 20 years. Yeah. That's like that's like saying if you're watching a football game and someone scores the touchdown. It's not necessary for the referee. Exactly. Or if I can't see the field, well, why should the officials put their arms up in here? You can see whether or goes through or not. Or if you had a baseball game and someone hits a ball down the line, the unparish shouldn't signal whether or not. Exactly. You can see whether it's fair or foul. You can see that chalk fly or not is the case may be right. I mean, you know, what is what these people here? The fact that most of these people, not being real sports fans, this is the only place in the world where they would accept the fact that something is ludicrous as simple as this can't be done right. Only these people would accept it. I mean, part of the fun of going to a game is if you're sitting up in the rasters on the other side of the rink and the light goes on, that's a reason to get excited anyway. Right. Not to assume that the fans are there. There are many goals that are scored in the macaroon or where the reaction from the crowd is kind of like slow-mo, because everybody's looking at the people next to them, seeing if they're jumping up in the name, they're going or didn't know that going. Because about 80% of the people can't see the goal like depending on the which end they're sitting on. I think a lot of the people don't even know they're at a hockey game. Yeah, no they don't. They're sitting there. It's a social club. You're right. It's just a guy named social club. I feel much better than other. Okay, have a great day. Okay, let's talk about that light some more to piss that one guy on. Ow! Well, he's probably squeezing it right now. We have an open line of day one and a broad. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, palm five, 60 on the AT&T. What else? See, I've told you this before and it's true. That's why having a sports talk station in a market like this, it would be like it would be like playing Romanian melodies in the middle of a, a callowet. You know, they're just aren't too many Romanian's around there. It would be like having an all Chinese melody station in this town where like I was talking about on Wednesday. We don't have any Chinese people. They're like about seven of them. It's 1557 at 5.50 QAM. So, Neil Roger show. Now, on 5, 60, WQAM. Miami Fort Lauderdale. It's Friday, you first, dude. It works the notion in the basket. It makes it all up. It works the notion in the basket. It works them both together. It works the notion in the basket. When the eyeball falls out, it works the notion in the basket. Then it has to hold it down. It works the notion in the basket. It's what I have to get it works the notion in the basket. You need to rub it on by rubbing. It works the notion in the basket. I have to try to make my schizu. It works the notion in the basket. I said, I said, I'll blow. I switch my TV. I'll make the idea. Oh, yeah. I like to dance around this way, isn't it? Oh, please. It's not the notion, it's quite a do-day, isn't it? Oh, please. I want you to look for like the wall for my name is Paprovel. It works the notion in the basket. It makes it more much easier. It works the notion in the basket. I owe it by Paprovel. It works the notion in the basket. Oh, what does it do? It works the notion in the basket. I've got my schizu manipulate. It's a bit of past no. It's $5.50WQ. So what does that really mean? You know, when you come down, what the hell is that? It puts the notion in the basket, man. I don't know. Open line of date. $5.605. Can you please explain all sides to us? No. How about I say? No. $5.605.60 on a mobile one line. Hey, Goldberg, you're a lot of the Royal Caribbean Caribbean. I don't know. That's stupid. Goal tournament. Two o'clock this afternoon. I'm going to talk to the clock to pregame. 730 Panthers in the Penguins in Pittsburgh. I mean, far beyond for me to start to knock in golf again, but I'm going to tell you. If you want to play golf, I guess it's good exercise boring, but you know, but Jesus Christ people had watched golf. I've mentioned this before. It's got to be the most unbelievably deadly. Remember that one guy when we first came here was talking about how he taped. There were two tournaments on that one Sunday afternoon. He was so torn between the two that he had a tape one while he was watching the other one line. I will grant you that I have done that with hockey games. If they're like on a big dish of this one game, and I want to watch another game live, hockey games, something exciting, like a real sporting event, like a game. Like a spectator. If you ever watched a gallery at a golf tournament, by the way. Then the guy I'll hit, you know, get a good shot. Then you hear like that. Yeah, like a tennis. That real kind of fake, very polite, the smattering. Yeah. And what kind of people go? Who are the people in a gallery at a golf tournament? What kind of a person goes to watch some guy or diek, hit a ball with a golf club? Like I said, I can understand that people want to play. It's the leisure recreation. It's a good time. They go out and think it will exercise. But to watch people play it, to spend money to go and attend a golf tournament. I mean, is there some message there that you people are trying to give us when you do that? I have no life. Yeah. Exactly. That's what I thought it was. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Hey, Neil, what's going on, guys? How are you doing, sir? I'm a 25-year-old Catholic who recently moved to the Jewish cemetery that they call Hollandail Beach. Can't go fact in the church. Oh, yeah. And I can't tell you how bad these Canadian drivers piss me off. Is that Jamie Slevens on the back of the plate? Is that stand for student driver or a team? Are you two of them? Stand for what? Give me free souvenirs. Oh, these people, I mean, they know this is a border. Another thing I had to get up by Chesselau, this Eddie Kaplan guy was a gambling. The gambling show, yeah. The gambling is a legal prize. I know, in this state. And so it's prostitution. But you don't hear anyone calling up saying, hey, Eddie, can you recommend a couple good prostitutes? I guarantee, you know, you just made an excellent point. In fact, that's one of the greatest programming calls we've ever had. And so, you're in two instead of those very marginal numbers that we have on that show at night. If any of what's started talking about where the hookers are, we have a double digit share on that show every night. Well, we have a big family is considered a social problem. So it's prostitution in both legal and Vegas. So people call Eddie up and ask for prostitutes. It's not legal and Vegas, by the way. I mean, it's legal, right? And not in Vegas. Yeah. When I look at it, it's Vegas isn't Carson County. And the, uh, which county is a car county? I can't get them confused. One of those is legal, but not in Vegas. Okay. By point being that, I mean, if you relate it to standing and calling them, go, hey, you got any tips on a couple of hot broads for me. I understand, but that's the hypocrisy. These people with their bookies don't you understand the hypocrisy of America? Everybody in their brother allegedly has a bookie. Everybody's like these super calls we get in the show. Hey, hey, what's the number on that dook game? I mean, who wants to hear about it? If you want to have like a bookie line, get a bookie line. But I mean, what kind of conversation is that? It's nothing but a chronic gambling show. I agree. You know what, I'm a young kid and I'm all my friends that I graduate at high school in college with, I mean, we go to these games. They're not making more than 30,000 years. And they're betting $500 a day. I mean, it's a problem. They're betting five or six hundred bucks a day? Yeah. And anything that'll move, these kids literally have problems. I've never been, I've been on a cruise once, but 20 bucks on a blackjack table. But these kids are betting five and six hundred bucks on a given day. They don't even watch the dolphins in their down there. Time for some help, pal. Time for some serious help. Yeah. Get them to AA right away. Any captain here at Dushback? Okay, thanks. Yeah, well, in fact, that he was, I was coming home from the track last night where I was, Oh, I lost 40 bucks by the way. Lusen, my answer last night at Brad Kramer and Northfield Downs with a $13 horse. Oh, I was going Brad. What a move they're whipping and slashing and driving. Also bailed fat rich out there with that race. We're losing our ass. But I mean, I lose, I, you know, lost 40 bucks. I don't gamble a lot. But I go to Vegas net, needless to say I'll take a fairly serious amount of money. But not money that I'm going to miss. But people are like, compulsive gamblers that have to have a bet on every event. See, that's not a sports fan. I know that comes as a great shock to some of the people who listen to and some of the people have work on this station. The idea that you have to have a tangible gambling involvement in a sporting event to be interested. That to me is sick. It's free country if you want to do that. Even though it's illegal in most cases since they're doing it with their bookie. But nevertheless, I don't care. But that's sick. And that's not a sports fan. I mean, is there anybody who was at that the Leafs Panther game Wednesday that had a bet on that game? You know, you have to be sick. To bet on a hockey game? Any, I heard there's met a fact when I'm coming home last night Tom Zickas on there. With that Kaplan, they're doing a show out there at the dog track. And they're talking about which dogs they're betting and which race and this and that. And I love when somebody I look at both Eddie and Tom Zickas said. And I thought, I don't know what's when he's talking about. Ah, no, they're both good guys. They're all that necessarily. Good guys, but you know, chronic gambling, chronic chronic gambling crab. It's terminal. It's ponderous. I could have brought in the program from Pompatau Park last night and said, Oh, my God, Bruce Ranger, what a drive he gave this three in Walley. Hennessey was waiting for that to bellow. He was leaving in a race and I'll on and on and on. I can do that. I'd be out of business in five minutes if I was doing that crab. It's terminal. It's ponderous. And the idea that we're eating it, abetting all these chronic sick gamblers out there. That's really sad. I mean, you know, hookers, there you go. If we want to give it out full numbers and locations and addresses, I'm talking about people that are safe. People that are clean. Who would do that show? What's the number on it? Here's a mobile and four-letterdale. Hello. Hey, Neil, how are you? Great. Let's see. Draw the faces almost as red as mine now. Neil, the other day, do you watch sports center after the Tampa Bay or Washington game? Like I would watch the Tampa Bay Washington game. It seems to me I was at the Panther game then. I said, nothing. I would watch. No sports center the next day. They had to join every single goal. That that Washington was scoring on Tampa Bay. Yeah. And they had Andrews Canter in the background doing his thing. It was hilarious. And then after, then after, where they're showing off the Tampa Bay players, You know, I don't understand. What is Andre's canter? Oh, I see the goal thing. I got him. Yeah, they shook ten goals. They shook all ten goals. What does he ever do with the hockey, you know? Yeah. They're going to soccer guy with a big mouth into the hockey thing. Okay. Thanks for a good news. Do we have that nearby the way on race, canter? Hey, bro. I'm going to survive. You're going to have an offer there. Enough with him already. Hey, bro. I'm telling you what they know is his panicking. A lot of practice with those tongues. You know, even at the beginning of a word, which is not easy. That's tough to do. You're a real good thriller. If you can do it like at the beginning of a, Oh, Roberto. Roberto, I can do it. I got a lot of experience with my tongue too. I do like that. I'm going to say after noon at five, 60, WQM. I think I'm ready for lunch. I'm ready for some my usual stuff. Is my face a little bit, yeah. It's coming back a little bit. See, they just can't, they can't give you a top opportunity to recover in this place. You come in. I'm out one day yesterday. It's my second out day out sick in the year at 13 months. Not bad. Come back one day later. I'll have a son and everything in here is turned to instant clear crab. You would think that if they would just, but, well, sorry, don't even go there. They'll cliche ridden asshole say. Don't even go there. Just do your due diligence. Yeah, and get some closure. Hey, when you lose sleep from the night to the next, it's known as sleep deprivation. Even a modest loss of sleep from night to night can have serious impact on the way your body functions in the way you function and feel during the next day. If you toss and turn a night, it could be because the mattress you're sleeping on is history. It's a real piece of crab. A great way to assure a remarkable great night's sleep is to have a quality mattress and a best way to buy one is call our friends at dialo mattress. God, don't care about the bed. God, don't let me get through. God, don't let me see. I'm not you, I'm your friend. I just thought I'd say, but I was dying to be afraid of the pain. The pain is not running through. But the pain is not going through. Oh, God, don't let me get through. God, don't let me get through. Oh, God, don't let me get through. Oh, God, don't let me get through. 15 to 5 60 WQAM and I guess Sam and the nephew out there it's pizza lot they're very lonely okay and they're calling Georgia begging us begging us please see I would

that weight but that will 170 pounds oh and I went down to 170 I wasn't taking anything for it well it was perfect it was like I went 10 over a one 10 over 70 I would think that would be the incentive oh I know you know I when I drove out of the doctor's yesterday uh and he didn't say anything about it he did this particular doctor is usually is the kind of guy that says you better lose the weight you're going to be digs and I didn't even waste his time okay because on his scale with my shoes not my clothes yesterday weight 204 so believe me I got a lot long way to go buy I had a good day yes to the eating wise I would I would think that would be the incentive right because if you lose the weight because if you're gonna get off of it there's some people and have the central hypertension as you know which means it's got nothing with their weight but I'm lucky enough or unlucky but that it's the fat that I should do with my being diabetic and high hypertension and then if I would lose the goddamn weight I could take all the pills and throw many extra well I think beginning today it's it's a new lease for you and and what we're going to over a new maple leaf right exactly we're going to

open line of brown at five six seven oh five sixty palm five sixty on a mobile one line see every i've already conditioned his audience to it every call like that is not a shutter me it's a shot of yourself yeah like Russian rule out with a gun fully loaded because you're admitting that you're not only are you listening you're making the effort which i thank you profusely because not too many

you're a break what here's a bunch of dottering old parts oh my god look at that there's still a lot it can't be as bad as you know juvenile golf okay i say but you know i'm in the 27 plus who the old

with those beds he was married when he was about like 15 years old I was like 12 I think uh thanks though the marriage were like 20 years yeah uh it just seems to me that when you're a child actor you're signing a death warrant for the rest of your life you grew up to be psychotic right they almost every one of mine's up to be really screwed up absolutely like a poor Jane North the Adenis the penis boy whoo uh and and heavy uh really and even i kid that that played Nicholas and eight of the enough he still hasn't grown into that cranium maybe he's Joe Rose whatever happened by the way to well Vince van Patten and the Scott by a bail do they run off together right there you know I had enough you know I all I'm saying it is just that actually and the eating thing is enough we're not whatever that was that was embarrassing i mean pretty way to just just to tell you I just tell you what kind of level these guys are i mean the only normal person that i've seen close to it is

Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. As far as Chelsea quit there, quit and as you turn every campaign advertising some sea ran for governor. Right. Yeah. And he had her in that beach dancing scene where he that they put together that they tried to grow a little for the firm self. I mean, all of that. I mean, that weekend, a few months ago, and it's the whole family, a flu up there to high anis. You know, after this whole thing blew so to speak. Right. So she was running around glad handing everybody. I mean, she was, you know, part of the whole honor there. She was his visible. She wasn't like the dog hiding in a back somewhere like, but he, you know, she was out there doing it. And you've got to put her in between him and Hillary when their whole hands get down in the helicopter. Right. All I can say is God bless Ken Star. No, you're the God bless Ken Star. Oh, well, yeah. And the horsey rode in on like James Carvel said. God bless Ken Star to a dragist you all of this crap. But yes, what, pal, we from the day you won't be saying God bless Ken Star. You're going to be saying, oh, because we all over baby, we can go on with life again. Instead of this right wing paranoia, this sexual right wing paranoia. Open line of day, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wilders line. North Miami, hello. Part of the first family is not like she's got a choice. It's good use to it. Another two weeks and no one will care. I don't think we're gotten to. But she's she is a public figure. Yes, you have a big, big, big, big, big. Yeah, I wanted to make a comment about the zipper. Since you've had such wonderful response. Not that. Because they don't know who he is. They have no idea who he is. You know, hang way on the air. Yeah. I guess people that don't about a month ago and nobody, nobody cared. But nobody knew. You know, he like. Weaver is just, we don't have a choice. That's who you listen to. I found myself enjoying and Hank and and managed more than actually the guys that do the game. Because after time I listened on the radio, you know, then a lot of the games are blind. Well, not that you've managed. You weren't doing cutler on the dolphin games. We wouldn't have anybody listening. He really, I thought, tank used to be real good. Right. But managed. I will say is an I enjoy Hank and I'm a fan of Hank. Right. Man that just makes that radio, you know, broadcast. But actually, he's a wild man because he doesn't take it too seriously. Because you got to sense a humor about it. He's a homer, but he lets you know when they stink. So yeah. But anyways, that's just something that, you know, if he's there, he isn't there. You know, what are you going to do? He doesn't live here. What does he care? Exactly. Listen, guy, we're a grad one. A high for the next two games. It's going to help because it's two tough teams. Okay. That's the luck. Go, Panthers go. Like he said. Hey. Thench of power manure. Puppers over this performance by the dolphin. Okay. We have an open line of date. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, and can you imagine Tim McCarber saying that? No, no. I don't think so. There's only one Jim Mandage. I'll tell you that right now. Here's a mobile and keep this game. Hello. Yes. Yes sir. Yes, I am. Thanks. Thank you. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm not. That was you. I'm sorry. I'm not just whatever my name is. Wait. I'm a human. And we were 60. All right. Oh. And I listen to your radio to your program every day. Even to this show. It is. God bless you sir. Definitely. And I agree with most of the things you say. Excellent thing. I've to keep you on view this. Okay. See you. Okay. Well, how do you like that? There's an old spec and solicitor to this show. All right. What are you arbitrarizing people? I bet you we got lots of course they want to, you know, their voices to be identified. Because then they'll be looking for me domino park. This guy, this guy don't waste his time in domino park. See. This guy's not one of those old parks in the run. Fidel, Fidel, companies that go, you know, at same old tyrant tune rhymes with. June. We have an open line of date. And of course that thing about the cool. We haven't had one black person say that offense. Me. I'm not one. I think I hit the mother load again. Okay. Arguing about African American. There is no such thing as an African American. Nobody just got off the boat from, you know, Kenya or South Africa or Nicaria, one of those countries over there. Unless they just came from there. They are not an African or are they? No. No. For what kind of a stupid thing you get sucked into. Don't get sucked into labeling yourself because the white establishment wants you to be labeled. Okay. Just tell them, blow it out your white. Back to them. And stop what all is politically correct to horsecraft. Here's a mobile and cool spring. Hello. How are you doing? Great. Yeah. I have to disagree with your statement that there's no such thing as an African American. There's a couple years ago. My wife became a US citizen. And I went to the ceremony there. And they would call out different countries and then the people would stand up from the countries. And then when they got to South Africa, they called out South Africa. And I left them a white woman to sit up. She's an African American. That's the only one I've ever seen. A white African American. Oh, absolutely. Okay. So that's the only one I've ever seen. I've never seen an actual black African American. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Okay. So there's white African or American. But there's no black ones. Is that correct? Uh-huh. Thank you. Good point. Okay. We got this clarified. We got it down. Yeah. Okay. No African Americans. No African Americans. And African Cuban. No African Jamaican. No African, uh, whatever. Hello, I'd be. No. We have an open line in the end. Of course, why would you want to be African anyway? And what about is that all about? You want to be identified with cannibals? Is that what it is? Cannibal Lecture? Or maybe it is that how much is sticking a bone tree? You know, is what that's been right in there. Still probably someplace over there where they have tribes. Am I right? So they still stick bone to their, uh, nose. Eight minutes after one and five sixty WCM. I'll get to that thing about the French Canadians by the way. Now what's your name that you've very upset about this story in city losing? My good close personal friend. Your close personal friend Susan, I used to work over there with us. She didn't work at the Paxon, but she worked in the same building. What was that thing called? Marketing magic. Marketing magic with that asshole Jack. Shit. Mark. What did you say? I didn't say it. Jack. I said ball. That guy didn't know Jack. And you did. Yeah. What was that? What did this man just say what I thought he said? I wanted. Yes he did. But then we called him over there. Yeah, well he didn't know Jack. Sprint. But anyway, she wrote a column for City League magazine about the stuff going on this weekend. And one of the things is Canada Fest 99. And she starts out in the very first paragraph by saying if there's an unusual number of men walking on Hollywood beats with thongs exposing their cheeks, then it must be the 15th annual Canada Fest. And then she goes out of the describe who's going to be there and what they're going to be doing. And just based on that first paragraph because she talked about frogs with the bear cheeks and she said very darkly to us thought they want to they're trying to get a raspire. Those freaking frogs. Let me tell you this. Okay, frogs. I just floored him back for probably we'll go home. He hates my points. Go for you cheap frog bastard you. God. By the way, did you know that George said, huh? Can't understand if you wanted to have 50 WQM if you trying to suck on our average old y'all about that at the end. Can they? Yeah. You come here every year. Oh. Oh. People. Hey, stop it. My mowing head from me. You're quite big. I only had one eye. Well, you eat like pigs and you dress like flubs. Clawgah highways with your car. And, beally the one thing worse than a restaurant is to see you in a bar. Well, Ed. God keep us safe. I'll sense can't eat him for you. By a one way to sit on your camera door. Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck. Oh, fuck, fuck. Please make the frog. Oh. All right. 14 at 5. 60 WQM. So I just heard a staggering rumor, which I'm sure must be true. I think Fat Boy was the one circling this rumor around the building if I'm not mistaken. That there's another AM sports station going on here in this market like very, very soon. Wow. Maybe they'll actually put the sports bags on your, huh? Wow. We'll be a big trouble and that's fucking bit. Yeah. And maybe some of the people from here, maybe some of the people with the high squeaky voices from here. We'll actually wind up over on that new sports station. Man. Can't you imagine some of the people upstairs at that if that turned out to be true? Oh, they're going to have a heavy, heavy, dirty weekend, baby. Woo! Yeah. We're going to have our own party. Okay. Screw there, party. Oh. We have an open line of day one and a broad. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60 on the, it's a, hey listen, there's an out-forging sports there's an chronic ambush in this town to fill up the lines. I'm too, uh, huh? Oh yeah. Hey, what about what's the number on that, uh, Geneva, a whole bar game? What's the number on that Albion College, uh, Holland Michigan game? Here's a mobile and four-laterdill. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. I just wanted to, you made a comment earlier about Rick Leaver. I'm not sure what you were looking for in an answer. Well, I'm not going to be there. I used to use this, but it's one of my favorite reasons. Like, what one of them would see? Yeah. Well, the only thing I could make a comment on is I haven't listened to the radio at a dolphin game. Since Rick Leaver and Hank have done on this new guy Bill is a jerk and he's kind of, and I think that the answer just touched your home, right? Can't even stand him to even always the next job and all. And it is a home home? No. Home or? Oh. Home or home or home or. Yeah. But I mean, as far as the, uh, you know, like Jim Manich? Not really. I think that he gets over. He goes to the lower board. Yeah. I think they're really truly the best team that they had for the longest time as Rick Leaver and Hank over. Hank was laid on there and, and we were of course, was a pro. But in the last couple of years he started, you know, they had a good deal. Yeah. You get a road map in Tomory. Was he still better in Zimfer? Yeah. Well, he was having a proposal problem. I think that didn't really help him in as far as doing a good broadcast. But even though he had all those Rick Leaverisms, whatever you call him, I still think he, he was, a lot better in the running back. I started in the cracks in the big holes. Yeah. That's a good line. I've heard that one before. There you go. Well, listen, all of that. He's in Mississippi. All of a sudden I'm a letter for you. Thank you. Have a great day. He was good. We broke. He smelled bad. He was a really egotistical strange guy. He had a distinctive flare as opposed to, you know, the guy we got. I was like a voice out of a box somewhere, basically. We have an open line of day one and Broward, 560560560 on the ATT, where it'll come. Anybody out there going to inspire reports on the new sports station? Let's go out. No. Let's hear it. Especially before the weekend comes. Let's get these guys upstairs just all over the place, man. Come Mr. Whipple over the weekend, George. Monday morning, you're going to have to have extra roles all over this place. Boy, they're going to be crap in their pants. We won't be seeing him all weekend. He'll be locked behind closed doors going. Boy, he really doesn't know what it means. He thinks the deal backwards. Oh, they'll be going nuts. Here's Kendall. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. What's up? I do have to know what's on. Why, man, they got shmandish. I can't ever channel them. I don't know what that was all about. I don't know who was canned or I know you're not on a weekend. Sports thing anymore, but I saw him on there with Jimmy Siffles. The edges the other day. They said after the silver ball that his contract was not renewed. There's always a story behind the story. I'll have to ask him about it. But certainly, if he had to choose between him and Jimmy Siffles, I mean, mad at his a thousand times better than Jimmy on a bad day. Absolutely. Yeah. Of course he and Wayne are sisters, though. One of the simplest and the same pot-take. Really? What did he just say? Something about Siffles with Wayne on Wayne's ball spot? I've missed it. Your fall is breaking up, but I was getting pretty interesting. So the guy before said, mad, this is a homeowner. And his guy says Jimmy Siffles has got Wayne's ball spot on his back room. Two open lines in date. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello? Yes, man. Neil, hi. Sorry I'm paying a toll. Anyway, I'm calling about the calling about the African Americans. By the way, hi to my good friend. What's your name over there on the A tool booth? Okay. What's your name? Automatic. So, I have a question for you. It's the exact terminology for white people as Caucasians. Yeah. And what would it be for black people? What's the last time you ever called somebody a Caucasian? Not often. Maybe you checked that box or something. If you were going to be sure, in other words, if you were going to ask somebody who committed a crime, was that person white or black? You would never say was that person Caucasian or African-American? Would you ever say that? No. No. No. But I'm just wondering if there is another term. I'm in business and I sometimes feel with black people. Okay. How about a spook? I'm a fat. I really don't think that would be a thing. It's a lot easier to say than African-American. I agree. If you say a nice, long-table word like cool or a spook, I say, let's go with it. Right. But I, you know, I'm in sales. I'm trying to sell to these people. So I'm trying to... Or maybe shaw. I don't want to be PC, but... Yeah. I'm having a... How about the dark? How about the dark, complexed? Okay. I'll try that one. How about pigmented, pigmented challenge in America? Pigmented with knowledge. Okay. Have a great day sweetheart. Say how to all your white friends. Okay. We have an open line. I mean, you never refer to somebody white as a Caucasian? It's ridiculous. Any more than you refer to somebody with yellow skin as an Asian or oriental. I mean, or you're always giving me that nitty. I don't care what you say. I didn't make it up. But by looking how easily that works. If you say Gook, I mean, don't you know exactly what we mean? Uh-huh. Yeah. And I never heard anybody, uh, bitch about that. So if Gook is good for the gander, then Spook is good for the goose. Because we don't have any Gooks in the audience. Okay. We got our friends up there at the Emerald Coast, who are from Toronto and Big Napoli fans by the... I've got all of those people up there. I didn't even know they were from Toronto. I'm going into this weekend. We're going to have one day this week. You did a Maris Sunday. Haven't been up there for a long time. Now that I know we got some Maple Leaf fans up there at Emerald Coast. I might even wear my A-B-A-B-A-M-A-M-A-P-Leaf jersey in there. You think I would look good? No, I don't think so. Look like a jackass. Kind of looks juvenile. I'll take guys to be for about this show. I just want to be juvenile. I want to be like a mature adult. Okay. I want to be one of... I can't wait for this new sports station. Kind of. I actually have some interesting stuff on it. Huh? Maybe put these bastards on there. Toes a little bit. Oh! Because I got my bonus check in my pocket. But all of it came from this show between ten and two. Not one penny of it came from like the rest of the day. And I'm pretty perporked off about that. Sounds to me like some people let us down and themselves as well. I mean, we certainly could do it. I don't know how their other deals work. They're all in this one. Yeah. See how they like that. So we certainly did our best to help make them some extra money. If they didn't do it, they would look at us. Even if this is some kind of a Gooseball show. Here's a mobile and four miles. Hello. Neil Mann. Yes, man. You can call me a black, you know. But I got something else to say. How about cool with that body? Uh, jiggle booth is pretty pretty. Jiggle booth. That's not bad. That's too many syllables. Jiggle booth. Spooks not bad. Jiggle booth booth. Scharzer. Yeah. I really like Scharzer though. You gotta admit, you gotta just got a great sound to it. Scharzer. Okay. Take this out by the... Another guy got exposed from a Republican body, like yesterday. Yeah. He's good. I forgot his name, but he was like a... Didn't the case for a beachman he's saying how cling was a womanized in all his crap. Yeah. Neil Mann has wife is sitting there and then has girlfriend sitting in the same, in the same same place. They're sitting in here in room. Yeah. And it's sitting in a choir room. And I just thought, you know. Well, I'll come inside of the mainstream media. Yeah. Well, the rather was talking about the last night. Yeah. Draw those black things. And he's a Puerto Rican too, by the way. And Jewish. Is he got taken back to the church and moved to out of him too? Exactly. All right. If you don't watch his ass, okay. Have a great day, sir. Wow. So what was that all about? Some of them better get the inquiring. Find out which one of these fascists has been screwing around again. Oh, and it was a great moment yesterday, which I'm sure you weren't watching. When there was a little disturbance in the gallery. And they took the 75th vote on Mother We Should Have. You know, they voted. We didn't want Monica in person because she's a slut and smells bad. And we didn't want this. And we did want that. And then when he finally voted the thing, I'm bringing in a video tapes and I'm going to be following that some old fart up in the gallery yells out, why don't you take a final vote and you're over there? And it was like this hushed silence like, ah. And that fascist renquis said, you know, please, please, the restore order of the gallery. And of course, they probably yanked this guy. And we'll see him no more. Right. Tell Mr. Biden in the gallery of the United States Senate, okay. While they're doing their due diligence and holding it, we're going to have some more discussions in trying to bring this to closure. Right. Are they trying to close it? We have an open line of day five six seven and, Let's have the count on. I mean, one week from today, even at that's switching Trent law with his pompoms as next Thursday or Friday at the latest by noon, okay. So we're less than a week away. We're now in 24 minutes at the most at the outside. From getting all of this absolute unmitigated. God, Jesus. You think, and they did the deposition to get it. Anybody in the three of them say anything new. No. Do they change their story? No. But they're anything significant that we haven't already had 85,000 times. No. Is there anything they're going to be seeing on the video tapes tomorrow? No. But they just cling and cling. Like, like, one, I just won't, you know, that won't fall off your act. Boom, fling on. Yeah. Get that baby in the bowl and let's get on with life already, okay. Look at all the trees they have to knock down to get you enough paper to get rid of that cling on. You know, just wiggle it a little get out of there. Maybe. 125, at 560 WQAM. Hey, if you're speaking French, you've been to traditional horses. And you've tried the local Escort Service. But the big problem with these is you're a real busy guy. And your life moves real fast. You don't have all that time to take for your horn to get on dress. Get ready. Do the job and then get paid. You just want to get in, get out, you end in out, and in out and then go. Well, then you're going to love this. If the all new hump and go, the prostitution station you've been dreaming of. Once you drive up to a hump and go, you'll see an escalator at the front door. Hop on. At the top of the escalator, you'll see one of our many fine prostitutes already to go. Once again, hop on. Hop and go. Also has pay at the hump service too. On the headboard, you'll see a little slot for your credit card. Once you're done, just slide the card in and you're ready to go. It's the all new hump and go. The fastest thing in town. Thank you. Okay, once dirty, well, I was busy throwing a lot of stuff. Okay, because I like to clean the joint up even though nobody else uses it. But just slabs out there, though, guys that were in here last week. Slabs. Anyway, here's the fact that says if there's going to be another sports station in the market, maybe we could have Phil Henry on the satellite. 10 PM to 2 AM every week night. Are you sure? You're into more people, be listening to QM for extra four hours. Excellent point. Maybe I'll have a gambling show on the other station. You see? Huh? Or do they do that real micro narrow casting when they get us a lot of new stuff? Like dog tracks and high line only one. Like I said, maybe they'll have eight or nine of those shows on the other station. We have an open line in the Broward 560, 560, 560. So I guess this piece of news we have today probably opens the door for all those other rumors about. We're concerned coming over here and doing warnings. Wouldn't you think? And then like this fact said in the Phil beat on their 10 o'clock at night, till 2 am or the simultaneous for me show. Are you pretty sure I think that's what's happening? Here's a mobile at Naples, hello. Hey, new idea. Okay, sir. I don't know if anybody's brought this point up or not. No, but when slave boats brought the blacks from Africa, they would drop them off into Mecca and I'll dust and Haiti and that's all. Really, if you think about it, all blacks originate from Africa. And you look at all those blacks in Haiti and you know, Jamaica, they don't call themselves Africans or Africans or African Haiti. Exactly. Exactly. That's my point. There's no such thing. Nobody would ever dream of saying on an African Haitian. You know, that's something that was made up in this country. To just made up by white people in this country. Sure, never forget that made up by a bunch of honkeys. It's just like if you really think about it, there's only, you know, four races white, black, Asian and Indian. Yeah. And you look on an application anywhere you go for an application. They have on the race. But what about Puerto Ricans? Hispanic and, you know, and that's not a race. That's a culture. Yeah. Oh. So I'll take this home and stuff. Okay, I have a great day. Good point. Whatever he said, he said it's one day happy family is what he said. Isn't that number he's talking about? Yeah, I'm not. We have an open line of date, five, six, seven, five, six, six. Okay, Rick Weaver or Bill Zimfer. All right. How about that new sports station, huh? Oh. Oh. Woo. Man. Just what they needed to get this complacent Greg Reid off his ass. The big sports shot here, you know, Mr. Hot Shot. I got all those sports franchises. It's only cost than a 60 million a year. That's right. That's why all the underlings here can't make enough money to scrape together to buy a damn sandwich. Because he's got to give way in all the money from this joint. Nice going, Eric. Oh. Can you imagine the real studios we could have in this place with a equipment that worked if we weren't given ball to all that money for most of this marginal crap. I mean, the only thing we got on this station that draws an audience is for our sports is that often that's the only sporting event that we have on this station that draws an audience. And even their numbers, since they, you know, they cymelcastine power, which was absolutely ridiculous that, you know, they insisted on that. A lot of the NFL teams are insisting that with their radio broadcasts. They're just being on AM and your FM also. And they said, OK. So that, and of course, also being on CMQ and Spanish and almost there became on television. So by the time you narrow that down, it doesn't leave too much of the pile of over, baby. Just a little tiny here. PIE. So there you go. But that's OK because, you know, the man up there, he's obsessed. He's, I wouldn't be surprised if he was a jackstrap. You know, he's always in that nobody knows what he's doing in there. He's probably running around with a jackstrap shooting hoops, you know. What is Walkman on? Listen to, you know, broadcast games from 10 years ago. Because he looks real athletic to me. Here's a mobile and del Rey B. Hello. Yes, sir. Good day. How you doing? Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Good day. Yes. Good night. Good day. Good day. Oh. He's got to hug up, go to bed. See this? Good day. We're out enough for a barbecue tonight. And I've put it on in there. The live-multif Tommy<|th|> силbought a seasoned crab. And will be probably going to be a little bit easier because they have a lot of 애� who they like. That are a lot of people who can't carry the drick. I think the African American thing is the thing to make white people feel better about it. I mean Negro is, you know, Negro is some reminds me of like a Stephen Fetchie, you know, old black sandblow. That's Negro. And black, you know, black, black is black. And now what the song said black is freaking black. That would have should have been a bit of a change. Okay? We, we, I mean, we moved from Negro to Negro to, was not a derivation. And what the guy said the other day? What a moron you are sir. Yeah, Negroly. Well, that's a derivation of the, yeah, right. You're a derivation of a, uh, a species. Here's Margie. Hello. Hey, what are you doing? Great. I just wanted to call you. It's been a long time. So I've been able to call you.

Uh, next week I'm going to take my wife, uh, to Ruth Chris for the first time. Excellent choice. What do you recommend? Well, whatever you like. You like a rib eye? Uh, no. But I'm not laid in the state, you know, like a big fat juicy. The, remember you never had a rib eye steak though. Probably not. Rib eye steak. Trust me. I know it doesn't sound, uh, bleeding. That's the tastiest, the juiciest, the best rib eye steak. You get you some like the barbecue shrimp and a big fat rib eye steak with some of the side dishes like the, um, spinach or broccoli or rotten and the you'll go nuts. Okay. Fantastic. Listen, my five year old pride knows more about hockey and a lot of these fans. Here. You're a little bit from spot check to everybody. But you've got some to say to you real quick. Okay. Okay. I knew a nice to meet you. And nice to meet you, sir. We'll be so soon in the basket. How come I knew he was going to say it works the lotion in the basket. Thank you, sir. God bless you.

Every guy kid in the world is going to be running around saying, Did puts the lotion in the basket and the adults are going to be saying, say, what? Say what? Come on. Get with it already. It works the lotion in the basket. Here's a mobile in key largo. Hello. I have a train number. Yes, we are. Hey, they got it all wrong. They're pronouncing it wrong. It's not African American. It's a freaking American. A freak, yeah. Is that AFR IQUE? Hey, anyways. You know, I thought this was a big joke with Rimmer being the chief man, but did you ever watch the tape of the Montreal game? I know you went to it. The tape of the Montreal game? No. No. No. Why do I want to rewatch a game? I don't know. Here he interviewed a guy. I think he was a journalist from Edmonton and Jim Matheson or something. No. He says, oh, he's a good friend of his, of course. And the guy said, no, Jim Houston probably from Vancouver. I'm not a hero's name. Yeah. He's there all there to see Pablo, of course. Right. And he said, well, if you're staying longer, he says, I take out golf. And I got to say, well, he says, you know, we have six or seven spy reports on something about going out to dinner and then remember five of who he is. Hey, finally gave it up. Yeah. Okay. I have it. And have a great day, sir. What about those meals, Rimmer? They stuck. We have an open line in date, five, six, seven, five, six, six, five, six, six, six, on the AT&T Wireless Line 22 till 2 at QAM.

Well, listen, I don't know what's all these people. I'm labeled the New York Weekend. I always thought I was in the American. Yeah. And they call him in New York Weekend. I go to Puerto Rico. I'm a New York Weekend. I go to New York. I'm a big. I'm a man with no land. Yeah, so now I get it. Let me give you a little piece of advice. I whip out that swishblade one time. We've been in front of their post. They'll call you Mr. Renotime. Have a great day, pal. Hey, I was calling you. Yeah, yeah, yeah, you hit the coffee. There's my fart, drink you west. All right.

I mean, what's the point? Just talk with someone there, too. Now that's the new deal. Let's straight people beside Suds Coleman go to go to Key West. Is that what you're saying? Damn it. Yeah. I'm sorry. No, I really don't understand that. I mean, if you want to get south, there's plenty of places here. You can do it without going all the way down there. And then we're going to, uh, to Lane Highway to Hell. Is it deck right down there? It says worth taking your life in your hands to drive that highway down there? No way. Here's a lady mobile and Cooper city, hello. Hello, yes. I'm going to know that I'm not a you. I've got one because I'm, I'm to make him five books and I don't know. Be kind of sending to him. You don't start calling me son. I didn't call you a son. But anyway, me. I don't hear you want up or I'm when they study calling. Two bunch cubans of my friends or Italian study just. I never, I never called anybody cuban American or not. It was no up or a thing. I said, what? I'm when Italian study calling himself second generation. Second generation. That's when they said they want to be the turn that around. That's right. I'm second right now more sweetheart. That can. It's asked to run in Vegas, don't know. Yeah. You know, I just think that is on zero for you to. I'll get the African American because what's wrong? Because because what's wrong with someone's power and some of the African American. Let me ask you this question. Seriously, have you ever heard anybody call a Canadian African or African Canadian? No, I have never heard that. Well, why not? Are there black people in Canada? Yes, but that's not. That's their probability. But this is American if we choose to call these people African Americans. So another reason I'm a African American. If that was you saying. That's what I'm exactly what I'm doing. What is wrong with that? I mean, as you talk to me, I'm American. I mean, they're African American. But what do I call myself like an American American Fag and American. What is that? That's what you choose to call yourself. Well, no, and I would listen. If you want to call yourself that be my guess, but I don't think most black people woke up one day. It's that, hey, I be African American. They didn't say that. That was the white establishment. And then that. I know. So here's a new label for you. I think you always think to put them in a negative fashion. But what do I get if I can do? Do you make coolants? Do you? I said have a nice weekend. We have an open line of drought. 560 and 560 and 560 on the 18. Well, what was your point? Does anybody know what it was? No. No. She was just a little worked up. She'll be alright. She was a nice lady. At least she wasn't kind of sending that thing about the gym. Maybe you're just in there voice. You know, that tone in their voice? Were they talked to you like, like, just be patient with me because I'll take my, you know, ah, man. There's that very snoring looking down. You know, it was kind of thing with a Jamaican women, man. Just, and I was okay. Maybe even though what she was saying was, well, crap, but she was nice. Here's Miami. Hello. No. Yes, sir. Did you read there? The Smurvete Articola, the augurs, the truck of contributes is gold. Playing a building better by playing with the augur. Yeah, well, of course. You agree with that? Well, of course. Well, and naturally, I mean, look at Chip Miller and Jon Herdina now. They changed the lines. And all of a sudden, those guys are scoring goals. But the fact is that even after he's on another line, now, Yager and our structure is still playing great. But the next one, that's going to be a part of it. Okay. Don't you think that Whitney and the need of Mara are going to be playing a hell of a lot of veteran score more. Already are than the other buries here. Right. When you play with greatness, it brings out the best. If you've got it, if you don't have it, it doesn't make any of it. Who you play with? So to speak. So to me, like tonight now. Who do I like? Why you want to bet on a game? Yeah, what's the number on that path? There's pegwa-shing. Oh, oh, my god. Then now they burst my bubble. They're talking about that. That Jeff Heiss, soon as he comes in, he starts spreading bad rumors. You know, some other sports station going on in the air and he spread rumors that this is going over there and Joe's going there and Hank's going there. Hank just signed a new four-year deal here. He's not going anywhere. Oh, I'll be honest with you. What they're doing to him, it'll be lucky if we can keep a life for four years. They keep slipping around these places. It's 11 before two at five, 60. Let me see how my face is feeling on fire right now. Okay, for those who are keeping track. How about my, uh, my neck? How's it looking in there, huh? Looking okay. Let's go to the woods this morning. You're good. Great. There you go. Okay. Good clinic, Dr. Poskudnyak. It's a good guy. If he's good enough for the Panthers. In fact, he said to me yesterday, he's in the middle of examining me, he said, Boy, if you ever saw Pawel Brey naked, and I said, yeah, I need this kind of Snickers. Hey, if you're feeling lucky, speaking of that, there's actually 24 hours today at Hollywood Semero Gaming, which is given away more than a billion dollars since the open of 1979, and you could be the next big winner. Hey, if I could have been your defenders with a chocolate banner. Valentine's time, Sunday, up the night of 12, take the one-to-love to the lonely cancelling in front of you. If you're friendly, you're really good friends. If Valentine's time is all the juggle one night, that's the epic. If the world does right, you can't. Yeah. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. If you're not. Yeah, that garbage would have known on Valentine's Sunday. Now.
