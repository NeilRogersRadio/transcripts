Sports Radio 560, WGQAM, Miami-Port Latterdale presents the Neil Roger Show, to talk to Neil called 560-560 toll free for date and rarer or pound 560 on your cell pulse. The opinions of Neil is best callers or anyone else on the show to not necessarily reflect those of WQAM, B's B-WV acquisition, or the B's League rod test group. Now, Neil Roger is on Sports Radio 560, WGQAM, to keep your shots straight here and all free. Forget Jason. Forget Freddy. Forget John's or even a rollover. There's a monster there on the street that could strike at any moment or the people who drive. There's no escaping them because they're everywhere you go. They drift from lane to lane, they stalk the investigation second gear. Old, eat a food rod. I can't get around this guy. Look out honey, you're back enough. That's enough. You don't know what they're doing next until slowly they drive you. Coming soon to an intersection or ramp or parking lot new you. That was fluid 560 WQAM happy Monday to you. That's overhead, is sure pretty marginal. I'll tell you that. But at any rate B that is at me. The three most dreaded words in the history of automobile, the experience of driving a car. Service column lock. Huh? Yeah. What do I tell you about computers on cars man? They suck. They blow. They bite. Oh, it's greatly got computers now to make sure that everything is the right. Make sure that there are more things that can go wrong. I'm mind in my own business last night. Get ready to watch the Panthers in the flyers. What's quite frankly, oh my God. You had to take no those to sit and watch through that thing. And so I go over to my friendly amicostation to get some soda and a gas up. But I fill up the tank with gas. I go in and get some soda. I come out to my car. I put the key in the ignition. Service column lock. And there's that steering wheel again. This is the fourth time with my beautiful 99 Corvette. Fourth time. And you know what? Fourth time? You want it? You can have it. That began four and a half hours of psychosis, just unbelievable crap. And there's nothing you can do. You know, this is the fourth time. The first two times, I call the tow truck guy. He comes and sticks the key and ensure enough wouldn't you know. I don't know. There's nothing wrong here. And the car, the thing on locks. The third time I'm over in Broward Boulevard getting my mail in the strip shopping center. I come out and did it around. Did it around. I call my friends at the back road. They got the tow guy coming. I go out and try it for the 400 time. Oh, there it goes. It unlocks. It's steering over here. Last night was it cut a one lock? No. No. What kind of a lunatic invented computers on cars that freeze up the steering column? What kind of maniac is responsible for inventing something a piece of crap like that? So to make a long story short after walking home after driving back over there in my new a my other record, and trying 50,000 times to get that damn steering column on lock and to get that car moving somewhere. And I had a call and get thank God for the 24 hour correct service. Nice. Go on, boy. Head a towed into my dealer. Steering column freaking lock. However the lucky thing is that in the midst of all of this, I'm, you know, during the period of time that I'm home, I'm flipping back and forth because the panther again, Roger Nielsen, please, somebody give this guy a shot in the ribs and wake his ass up, will you? coma. So I flip over just in time to NBC because I'm wondering, you know, I must have been about, I don't know, 815 something like that, 813. And I'm wondering, when will they ever get to God day world series game? And by the way, why don't you just body cops? Why don't you just can see getting it over with, okay? Talk about choke and croak. God. So why did they even bother showing up? I turn over just in time. It must have been my lucky day and some other respect to see Jim Gray, even John Wilson, never committed in the assassination like this. And I don't even like Pete Rose. I can't stand Pete Rose. He's a scumbag, you know, he's an asshole. That too. See the top of the park for your four times. And he sits there with a stack of $100 bills on the table like he's going to win price. Everybody and plunging his brains. You know, something, his money. He wants to lose it. That's up to him. I don't like the guy. He was a great baseball player. One of the all-time best. Of course, he belongs in a Hall of Fame. But professional sports, they don't really care about the individual athlete. They don't care about the drug addicts. They don't care about the rapist. They don't care about the molesters. They don't care about any of those things. But God forbid if there's suspicion that somebody made a bet on his own sport, it puts a cloud of suspicion over the game itself. So therefore they get real pissed off. But Jim Gray, I'm going to tell you something. Jim Gray should be, he should put me put scrap to an electric chair on the NBC evening news tonight, right in the middle of a bro car. And electric unit on nationwide TV. You agree? Yes. I mean, this is a night. They got all the living. The top 100, the greatest baseball players of all time. Here's Ted Williams. Here's Hank here. Here's all these guys, okay? Over than the fools will buy the way. How you doing, Ted? Yeah. I'm going to like Ted Williams. Yeah. Go shoot some pigeons in the family part, Ted. And now they got Pete Rose out there who gets the biggest elevation. Every time the crowd is like, all the emotional about it, here we go. Some of the senior said it about he was great. We finally brought him out here. It's quite a bit silly being an asshole. And here comes this asshole. Jim Gray from NBC, asking the same question 75,000 times about the Jibba non baseball or what would you admit it when the commissioners got proof at it. Seriously. Well, I was in I was mortified. I was speechless. And Pete Rose says to him at the end of this deal, I just can't believe that you're doing this to me, that this is all you can ask the same thing over and over again ten times. And Jim Gray's response is, well, I can't believe that you don't want to settle this once and for all. I mean, like a goddamn verbal fist fight. I would love to do if Pete would have just hauled off and smashed him right in the goddamn head. Give him a shot to the head, Pete. Ted, that would have been the biggest elevation they would have had there. I would have turned her feel last night because there was certain often else for them to cheer about. What kind of journalism is that? What kind of an asshole pulls in the like that? He wasn't there for the purpose of being interrogated. He was there for the purpose of being honored. Whether you believe he gambled on baseball or not, it's him material. That's not what he was there for last night. But a disgrace, disgusting, unacceptable, a bunch of crap. Most of his much a bunch of crap is most of the sporting events over the weekend, by the way. Nice job there this morning, Eddie, the Pope and Dave Hyde, one in each paper, try to rationalize, you know, something. And of course in this town, you hesitate to say anything because the people don't care as long as their team, we won. See, we won. I feel better about myself. We won. I'm trying to figure which was more boring. The Panther game against the flyers last night. The telecast, too, by the way, or the Dolphin Eagle game yesterday. Keep in mind, here the Dolphin is playing a girl's team. It's like, oh yeah, well, it was beautiful. I mean, it was ugly and it was boring, but it was beautiful because we won. It wasn't beautiful. They won because the goddamn field goal attempted to get to the game, hits the goddamn upright. This is by half an inch. If it's half an inch to the left, it hits the upright and bounces through instead of bouncing away. And we won. We got something to be proud of according to these Dolphin. Very sad. I wonder what the hell they were watching. It was just terminal. And this is a reason why you see thousands and thousands of empty seats in all sport events. They got that brand new palas out there Los Angeles for the Kings. I watched some of that game last night. San Jose and the instead of thousands of empty yellow seats. Now they have thousands of empty blue seats. All right. Because people are just sick and tired of being held up without having to put their hands up a kneeer. So I can stick up. Give me all your money and we're going to put on a piece of crap that performance here for you. Mediaoker is best. And more and more people are saying, no, no, I don't think so. El Paso. You can think of expansion for a lot of that. Mediaoker is best. And if that was the hockey game last night, especially the last half of that game. And people are saying, well, you know, Roger Nielsen, he's back to his old tricks again. He's doing that trap like when he was here. Yeah, when he was here and you could get a go, you could fall asleep, try to watch a goddamn game. Nobody wants to see you at with all the talent, the high price talent he's got on that team. And that's the best performance they can do. If I were in that crowd, if I were a fire fan in the crowd, on the way out, I've been screaming for a refund. awful. Just got awful. By the way, the ratings are going to be out at 11.30 this morning with summer book. I'm thinking they're going to be speaking awfully. Yeah, it could be pretty weak. Maybe then Tom, Jacob, or right about it. I got plenty to say about him, baldy. God, are you a geek, Tom? Are you a silly, silly person who still just doesn't get it either. You don't get it. Or you don't want to admit you get it. You can't be that dumb. Can you be that dumb, Tom? Huh? 10 minutes after 10 at 5. 60 WQM. No portion of this broadcast, maybe reproduce without the express with permission of WQAM. Be free to ask position. You're right. Well, when it's time, let's have the record straight about my friend George Bush. Some people say he's there, no desire to join. If he gets drugs, my ex-men, so what's the point? He doesn't say, look at it. George Bush is fine. So what if he's gonna have a line? Well, he's the best damn candidate I've seen. I don't care if the cops in front of me. And the claim was that taking mine, so he's too far. He'd be fine. I guess I just don't understand what the big deal is. Well, that letting President Sermonovich, who does learn something or another. Like Gerald Moore, who is the best. Obviously he was on the way. Oh, I'm down. And he's a pretty Carter for example. But he was so hopped up on his phone. He didn't even know we were all suggest for the first day of my group. Why even went back to Washington? Notably, he only remembered. John Downs' Jerry Tree was a big fan of you. He had the lunches. Oh, that's funny. Oh, right. 15 to 5. 50 WQAM. So just when I was starting to feel a little bit more optimistic about our center one campaign, it's the only the 25th of October. Just when I was starting to feel a little bit better, because I got the effects here from a curall. 23,229 bucks so far. In spite of the fact that we've been in Limbo-based police in October 1, because of the mist because it was all screwed up with the CDs. And we got our pizza loft appearance tomorrow between 6 and 8 pm at the World Famous Pizza Loth and Baby. And I thought, well, we'll probably salvage maybe a reasonable October, and then do gangbusters November, December. And we also have a couple of grand and cash there, which he has to pick up. She's going to come and pick the money up there or what? One of these days? I'll just take it to the appearance. Oh, there you go. That's a good idea. You want to be a very busy, you know, Carol. But at any rate, so 20,220 means we've got about 25 grand in. And then what we got in there, what the bad news is that those buttons, you know, the key change with the buttons that we threw all these, oh, sounds, you know, from the show. That I was told last week, oh, yeah, we got the buttons you haven't got one in there yet, so but we got them and, uh, etc. And so on. Do we have them? No, no, they're on the way from San Jose. Being shipped out today, are we sure we're going to have them tomorrow? No, no. It's the 25th of October, Carol. It's the freaking 25th. I'll tell you, this is sensational. Go back to that great golf tournament. The OGA golf tournament. And then, of course, the CDs that sounded like, like that. And now these buttons, which was a great idea when all those, you know, sounds from the show on there, they can run around and just pop and people's pus. But stuff just isn't happening quite so fast. Is it, Dar? Just not happening too soon, is it, Carol? I'm the best I can. It's all I can do. You can order your stuff by the way off our website, nilroggers.com, which Eric does a great job on, by the way. And we will be a pizza locked tomorrow, 6 to 8 pm with it without the buttons. Okay, I mean, you know, so if we don't have those buttons, you have to go and let you put your finger in his belly button or something like that. Yeah, there's a button for you. And the clock? Yeah. You first, not me. So anyway, here's a letter to Tom Jika. I'm sure he makes these things up. He denies it, but I'm positive. That Tom Jika makes these letters up to the, He's a baby book in a son, sent it for last 20 years. Question, the drive with Scott and Sid on Waffen. Have we ever had a call about that show? Oh, although we have heard that are some of our sales nerds downstairs. Some of the sports that's probably Todd Drek. They think that's the greatest dance show on that guy show. You know, they talk guy talk. It's really great. These are the guys that got canned on the weekend here about three years ago. The drive with Scott and Sid on Waffen 1700 AM is probably the funniest best sports talk I've ever heard. WQAM is lucky that drive is not on opposite the first worst team in parentheses. The first in parentheses worst team. What do you think they got that by the way? However, the rest of the talent on Waffen is so pathetic. Also, when in where is Jim Rowan? Robon asks S.E. in for Lutterdale. Tom's answer. Saying Scott and Sid are the best hosts on Waffen is like saying they're the winner and first to run a rough of a beauty page in an upper colony. In fairness to Waffen, it's going through growing pains, growing pains. WQAM didn't have the strong line up. It does now when it first became all sports. As for the first team, their enemy isn't on a rival station. It's their own sales department, which overloads the show with so many ads they're barely as a show. For this reason alone, it's good to have a competitor around. If and when Waffen becomes a real competitor, virtually everyone currently on the year will have to be dumped for that to happen. WQAM managed to move before it's the big closer attention of what their station sounds like. Jim Rowan shows been moved from the take the lead in the WD to live in the 390, etc. So there's the letter of the day for Tom's Jicken yesterday's Sun Sentinel TV book. Thanks for the publicity for QA and though again Tom, but just still can't get it right. Oh yeah, their show is loaded with spots number one. But number two, it really doesn't make any difference. They put on the rest of the day on their cousins. You feel the point out they got done. I'm a seded man in the morning. They don't do a sports show in the morning. So what difference does it make? What people are going to put on from 10 a.m. to whatever they're going to sign off? What difference is that going to make about the first team, Tom? In addition to which you failed to mention the reason we got all of those got the spots on in the morning. It's nice to play because we got to pay Wayne and John Henry. It's not just because the sales department runs you, Silent Hill, which they do, but it's because we got to have, if we had a spot every minute of every day, if we just eliminated the programming, other than the ball games. Maybe we could afford to break even and pay that 35 million to John Henry and Wayne have pinga. That's what's crippling WQM. How come you don't get it? Tom is it because you're feeling for any care we know. And you don't want to tell us the real truth about our NF management and the bad deal they made on those ball games. Is that it? Tom? Yeah. And by the way, Tom still hasn't discovered a story about the SEC fine. It's pending. The 35. It's not just an SEC fine. It's a whole question to first amendment rights and content. And there are listeners right to choose what they want to listen to. It's a major story. It's time to discover that yet. Well, he was an LA one that happened. And Tom is one of these guys who if something happens when he's away or something happened, he doesn't know too much about. He doesn't want to really do too much to find out because I guess he's lazy. You know, he likes to pay trip to LA every year for a couple of months and some of the time. And he's basically going to go out to the track. She moves him with that he can. And that's Tom's your cause idea of covering a radio and TV in this market. Pretty disappointing Tom. In fact, I think it's safe to say you're out. Tom. Oh, yeah, now that you know we're going to have a done book in the summer book, it's going to be pretty marginal because we had a great month in July. A sensational on this show. And then August here. Wow. Like, don't lot of you. It must have been whappin'. It must have been Scotland said. Now they didn't show up in the last trend. But now that this book, it'll be two out of the three months they've been on a year. The, uh, whaffin' 1900 on the donna. I bet you when that number comes in 1130 or noon today, they're going to be kick and ass. You won't be laughing at laughing baby. Did they show it all? Oh, and they don't. Oh, and they don't. Oh, graphic and any day part. Oh, no. We'll see. Here's Papa, no, hello. Hey, and yeah, I'll show you a frustration on everything going on in the market. Uh, as I'm driving last night, I've heard on Q and M to try to catch the World Series game. Yeah. And I got the Panther game. Well, I understand that because of contractual. But there's nowhere else on the dial. Nobody else carries this. It's in the, I'm going to major, but I'll just have to before this happened. I don't know a few years ago, whatever that. Now, wouldn't you think queer channels since they own about 600 stations in the market? Wouldn't you think on those occasions when we can't pick up, uh, sporting event a major sporting event like a playoff game or World Series? Would you think that they would carry it? Absolutely. I mean, you do it with dolphin games and the preseason games and things where you're shifting around because you've got to show them what you got to have the Marlin games on. So, they'll put the dolphin somewhere else on the dial on a preseason. They'll do it for a dolphin preseason game, but they won't do it for a World Series game. And I was all over the place on the dial. I was going to AM and FM and I served held in the night. Well, I believe he didn't miss a thing. Yeah, well, I'm here and all the gym breaks up this morning. That's just so typical of that torpe. But when I got home last night, I started reading the new sport bill straighted and I'm, well, it's planning a fact, you know, if you could tell you, but there's the infamous picture. Yeah, no. It's for the illustrated. With Sam Duke cut out on one side and Roy cut out on the other side. Oh, they did cut them out. They cut the two of them out. You saw, like, Sam Duke shirts leave on one end. And then you saw, like, Roy Foxes all around. Well, that's all. It's not the same Duke in the building. He sure is shirts leave us up on the door. If you back yet, he's not coming back. Oh, he's not. It was back to clean out his desk a few days ago. Very good. Thanks Neil. Have a good one. You got a good one. Okay. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T, where I'll explain. I just wait. I just can't wait for somebody to call you here at the Fangeum Grey from NBC and I had to job either. He's not on acceptable road test to try to humiliate on national television. And if we're to all those people on the ballpark to try to humiliate this man. And again, I don't like the guy. But he's already suffered enough. What do you want to do? Put him up on a goddamn cross and crucify him there and a go in the ballpark. Huh? What have been the most exciting thing that happened there last night. And the first two games were Atlanta, bunch of gagging chokeers. You know, something. I don't like the match all that much. I don't dislike him. But I, you know, I was hoping to raise with when. But those people, let's say they're sick and tired of watching the brave's get in there. You're right. You're absolutely right. They choke. They're gagged. They suck. They would have been great if the match would have been them in that series. But then at least you had a competitive series. It would have been the only York to subway series. There would have been something exciting to it. Instead of all these Yahoo's chop in there. Yeah. And I had to do an FSU crap, you know. Do an at shop. Chop this like the commets fan said with the arrow two is a private shop. This. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, I mean, well, just that. I thought you'd like to know yesterday in the hero. I don't know if you caught that article on that, but in the sports section, they said that the offers are playing at 4 p.m. Yeah. They've got a lot of late fans out there. They're the one o'clocking. Are you picking on a hero against her? Well, yeah. I guess so. And if you're not here, you're talking about it so often. They're a whole single day. They've got glaring mistakes because they don't care. And nobody else cares either. What else are you going to do? What else? What other paper are going to buy? The hero to sunset and a lot said, does the only choice you've got? I just dropped you like to know. I think you're just a bunch of morons. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Thanks. Okay. So, you know, something that might have been more exciting. Maybe they would have been awake at the game when it started for a clock. One of the most pathetic excuses. I heard a little dog this morning going out about how you could have gone to sleep watching the Tampa Bay Giant's game. Six to three. How about any game? Except maybe in the wingland Denver, which is the wingland tried desperately because no lead is big enough for them. Try desperately to blow that game. And almost did. You've got six media already now and nobody wants to admit it because let's face it. This is what these people can pay to talk about. So they have to pretend it's great. I mean, just unbelievably bad. I know we only got like six hockey fans out there and you know something the game Friday night here actually turned out to be pretty entertaining. Even though we lost it over time, we got the point the regulation tie. That turned out to be a dynamic sighting game. But that thing in Philadelphia last night. I still can't get over it. How could anybody, how did I force myself to stay through a long time? Yeah, I saw two states who watched all the way to the end all the way to a lot of channel surfing in between. Which thank goodness I did or I wouldn't have seen Jim Gray that that was just, I can't find the words, to describe how embarrassed and humiliated I was. For the network number one, here they're always bragging about there. The baseball in that work, they got Bob castest, Mister baseball. And by the way, you notice that once they chewed up to the booth there and cost this in Joe Morgan came on there, Pete roses former teammate, Joe Morgan. Did they say one word? one word about that interview about the the uh... sliced job that you've been on the road defa had a was a defa was a deal about did they look like they just crap in their pants actually job the full yeah they both are but we just got to real wet load in their pants and had a spin eat and look under face like that's a great life for baseball everybody hey and they were saying that the peacock left out okay they got the search party i looking for the guy that peacocky so embarrassed for jim gray the media is sick and needs help at least and the original quote or what yes like jessie says they're dangerous and speaking of jessie by the way you see this reform party but it's a company party they have a foot of a comedy channel we got that old truck today pep you can't stay put on a little must ask he's coming out today everybody's a opera probably is going to hop on there hop on his opera it's a comedy party twenty six after ten and five sixty w qi only one sub
