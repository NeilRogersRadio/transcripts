You said here from heaven. And you said it's little girl. I would back home in my pants. I think mommy keeps on you. But what if I can't bear time for it? A little my smile has been burning. Nice and damn it, I'll be here. I don't want to get a job. To be served, I'll give it more. To butterfly kisses that night. Daddy, you smell like beer. I'm trusting out of place. Daddy, I'm pregnant. I don't know who the father is. Ask the turn chick. I drove the car into a tree. Can you just send me some cigarettes? I'm not going to die. Hang out by the adults for the brightening world. Daddy, I'm getting married again. I'll give her away. Dad, that's my ass. Standing in the bride room. Just staring. I think I have a simple ass. I have to be one of my kids. And I said I'm not sure. I'm not a dad or girl. We're all always. Hey, pop. We're moving in. And butterfly kisses. Dad, I have news. I'm a lesbian. All right. So what could be wrong with that 10-04-560 WQA? I'm happy Monday too. Boy, a lot of crap went on this weekend. And have me. Have me. Doody Cran. Tom, jick is got a thing in here. But nobody in this audience cares about Joe Rose blowing up. And all that's thing begins suspended for two days. Nobody cares. I meant to not unfriety that anybody care. By the way, I played that for all you fathers out there. Even though it's one day late, better late than ever. Because I wasn't going to come in and work on Sunday. Perfect for fathers day. But nevertheless, Tom, jick are right to piece in here in the Saturday Sun Sentinel. About the fact that Joe Rose blows up after one to many commercials. We'll get to that. Then Gary Bettman does it again. Nice going. Gary. I'll tell you about that little Jew from Cornell. Hi, Tonya. Piece of crap. Sitting there watching that game four and a half hours almost five God damn hours to one 25 in a morning Saturday night. Only the National Hockey League that has a death wish. Only the National Hockey League would let a champion. If you know they're going out about this is the most difficult trophy to win in the world. It's a four or seven game series after winter. Five games series. Four or seven games series after winter. The wind is standing up. So why not give it a awarded on a bogus school that shouldn't have counted in the first place? Why not do that? Right, Gary. You're still for the little bastard. God, he's the anti-Christ. I'm telling you that right now. The National Hockey League will never make it until I get rid of that guy. They have a little Jerry Bettman. His ass should be kicked out now. Oh. Now I'm in more than glad to stick my foot up his back. Boom. He's a cramp. But anyway. Of course we had the, you know, I go out of town for a couple of days. I go off to Toronto. See all my good friends up there. Most of those names I don't know, but nevertheless. Hey, listen, you don't have to know somebody's name. Okay. You remember a face? Whatever it is, you remember, you know, Yeah, that too. Put it anywhere that comes back here. And it's like the world has come to an end down here. What's going on? Customs first lady declined a chance to amend declaration. I thought we had these right wing good intentions people in their anti-aliency. And that would you people wanted somebody who was a real good Christian. Somebody who's would never tell a lie. The wife of Florida's governor was quite reluctant to tell US Customs agents in Atlanta's Heart School of International Airport that she bought $19,000 in clothing, jewelry, and perfume during her recent vacation in Paris in gay Paris. Oh, I hope she didn't hear that word gay Paris. She probably have an arrest break down. First, Colomba Bush. What kind of a name is that? Anybody? Well, she's the Mexican one, right? Yeah, he's the, that's right. This is the governor that's got the kids. Whatever they are. The Mexican. Anyway, Colomba Bush declared only $500 worth of purchases. Then when customs official stumbled upon a receipt, tucked into her passport, he'll pass a port though. She still did I spending more. Lyrly or pants on fire, Colomba. The receipts were for old purchases she said. Another lie. We gave her an opportunity to change the declaration. And I believe she said, oh, said US Customs spokesman, Patrick Jones. It was only when they found the goods after searching her luggage on Thursday that Florida's first lady finally passed up. How do you like that? Was she lying? Yeah, she was lying through her goddamn teeth. She could have been more upfront, Jones said. Instead, they found the items Bush had bought during the four day Paris vacation she took last week. It was a vacation promise to her buyer husband, Guayona, Jim Bush during his campaign last year. Bush was treated no differently than anyone else would be in the same situation Jones said at any agents didn't know where the governor's wife until after were. Several calls to the governor spoke to the spokesman, Corey, Tilley on Friday and Saturday when I'm returned. The governor was scheduled to be at a 730 pm dinner on a Republican party chairman Alberto Cardinus Saturday but didn't attend. Colomba Bush was able to pay $4,100 civil fine. Three times more than the duty she would have paid on the merchandise if she would have declared it stupid bitch. Then catch the next life to tell her has he. And a statement released from tell a has he had Friday. She said, I'm sorry for exercising bad judgment and a kind of sure everyone this will never happen again. What you said till next time until I can get away with it. How do you like that, huh? Are you Bush liekers out there in this audience? That's right. Are you people that think that we got a governor who's a real outstanding great guy? Never stole a freight train with those great the license plates we got. Choose life. Don't choose the truth. Just choose life. There you go. Don't choose to be honest. Don't choose to pay the guy dead. Dildy. On this stuff you just brought in here from God damn gate parry. So don't do that. Choose life. And like I've always told you for the last 4,500 years now all these people, not most of them every God damn last one of them. The holy pontificators, every one of them is nothing but a God damn hypocrite. The louder they scream about how pious they are and they're better than everybody else in the God this and the Lord that the more that means they're full of crap. Okay, you can smell it. Let me get back to the cutting stage and probably could smell it. They didn't even aid those goddamn drug sniffing dogs you should pardon the expression. Speaking of drugs by the way, this building. We're going to have to do something about that. I think we're going to get a permanent DEA guy in this building. Now seriously, this is the drug building. Somebody said to me last week this is the Tanner Building. This isn't the Tanner Building. This is the drug building. I think we need a raid in here. We need a good DEA raid clean this place out. Excellent show last night, Harald. On time, when you do 50,000 show a sooner or later, you're going to do a good one. We'll get in at that in a minute.

No, no seriously golf Which have told you for years if you want to go out there play get a little exercise Have a few beers with a guy's whatever. You know go ahead. I won't tell anybody But people who watch golf on television and people who would watch women soccer and see this is what's going on now Because the American public are so goddamn bored Because they were there convinced that they're missing on something. I'm not sure what it is, but they've been convinced the good bill of goods that they're missing out on something And so we have to have more and more leagues and more and more sports and we got indoor at soccer without door soccer and outdoor football And arena football and turn around to start another guy's input ballics and just on and on and on how the Managers doing by the way Yeah, how the fusion do you know Yeah That's what we need like I told you before.

Okay, it is Lifeless fools Watching golf and women soccer watching a bunch of big ugly hairy bull dikes out there kicking it around in a soccer ball too Just what we need then of course we got the WNV8 coming to Miami I live bull dikes you know something I'm discovering the older that I get There are as an endless supply of bull dikes in the world. I mean there must have been a factory without seriously There must be a place where they stamp them out They're hairy just like that very nice dive call from plantation we hear two ago on a show and she was bitterly complaining About all the ugly bull dikes. She said aren't there any like attractive lesbians down here? Oh no Do you all have a lot of facial hair a lot of hair under their armpits? Some hair on their back bone and all over the place. I think we even have like a little hair on their breast to just to make the cheese more binding And that's where it's at okay Lesbians all over the goddamn place the world is loaded with lesbians so we got to have more sports, you know More stuff for them to compete in participate So anyway, who are all those got to show that I came which I can't stand her while though He makes me physically ill just a see him but I'm channel surfing last night and here's a show on NBC Which finally for once in our lives, you know how come it's got to be her all though? It's got no credibility at all anyway. Why can't we have these all over the place these shows? Exposing this fraud that goes on here America's war on drugs. Oh, yeah, that's working good in it. It's a working It's really doing a job And her all the points out that in like civilized places like in all of Europe, Australia and Canada That they deal with drug problems as health problems people that are like hooked on drugs people are like a screwed up on drugs It's a health problem not a crime problem not a puts this bathroom jail for 20 years and locked the door Throw away the key problem But in America because you progress out there Like to feel like you're doing a really good job, so let's see Maybe we can get like 90% of the population behind bars Huh, yeah by the end of the next century maybe we can get like 98% of the population behind bars Then imagine what note don't traffic problems Huh And then we'll have a captive audience will just make sure there's a goddamn radio and every cell they can put out arbitron die reason all the prisons Everybody in America's gonna be behind bars because everybody smoking and we can weed everybody's yeah, right They deal with it like a goddamn crime in this country and it's a joke It's an insult to our intelligence and there's a significant segment of the public of the people out there in radio land all over this country Who believe this crap? Oh, yes the government has to keep fighting this isn't that great They just confiscated another big level of weed that just was coming in from wherever was coming in Probably from inside this building is where was coming in from Oh, they won't live any out or like I said it wasn't from inside this building they keep it all inside Oh, by the way before I get back at the drug thing very big news time jikkiy But I put this into the condomorrow power 96 was blasting the music again this morning before I came in See they don't do it after I come in because they know I'll bitch them out They were blasted at the walls of Jericho where tumbled it on in this place and default and guilty We're in a little bit too loud. Yeah, I like that But leave it to our program directed the fact that the you know Greg read is still out of town They're that Mary you have something to do with his newly found muscle at these flexing he's flexing it and His muscle too He has fired the entire suspended the entire staff of power 90s Oh, for crack at that music up too loud. How do you like that? He don't even work on power 96 kid current. Oh, I think about it yet, but the entire staff of power 96 Suspended for today Oh, for put the music up to loud and screwing up with our morning show. Nice going tough. I told you he'd butcher up some day. Did I'm saying? So when we're getting back to the guy dead drugs All of Europe Australia Canada are neighbor to the north where I just was this week and I guarantee you won't see anybody on church street or young street or any other guy Dem Street getting busted up that there are smoking weed openly up there because they're not but nevertheless They have better things to you know they have better more important things to worry about up there Like who want to guide them hockey game serity night and how come they let that ghoul stand? Those are the kind of important things that they're worried about up there and Is the mulsans, you know, cool those are the things that they're concerned about Not as somebody smoking a little bit of weed they had two women on their last bite. It's enough to make you scream So it up to make you go nuts And of course they happen to be black women not that we have any discrimination I see I know this is gonna come as a shock and I have a difficult time saying this but I'm starting to reach a point in my life We're on beginning to understand even though I don't agree But I mean, you need to understand the just total frustration of black people in this country with it makes them Embrace OJ okay even OJ is a scumbag He's not one there people he's the wrong person there but nevertheless What they're really saying is okay one of our people got away even OJ may not want to be one of our people He can't change his skin color one of these shards has got away killed two white people and finally We got a little bit of a payback okay, that's what they're saying and as much as I find that repugnant and disgusting Nevertheless, I'm beginning to be able to relate to it Here were these two women and one woman. She's got two little kids no police record. You need the one of these women ever have any kind of police record any kind of problem with the law or anybody else And a one woman she was given a a bag she transported the bag with three ounces of cocaine and under the great Nelson Rockefeller law Anesthet in New York that piece of crap From 26 years ago in 1973 she's in a slamer 17 years no eligibility for parole Let me say it again no eligibility for parole. We have people who murder people first and remurder who get out after serving seven or eight or ten years How do you like that that's your criminal justice system for you, okay? That's the American Wait a minute Then they had the one guy on there who you know his big crime was growing weed in the backyard He's in for 20 years in the state in New York under the rocky fellow law Is this what you want and then they talked about the fact that the these people on average do longer than people of the Medviolent crimes We're talking about nonviolet crap But let's just keep building more jails and more prisons and put everybody away because God only knows we have to we have to We have to profess to be a bunch of goody two shoes. That's the problem of America. We love our guns and want to read in the morning the other night there is daylight Friday morning The NRA bought out your Congress again as they always do One thirty more in what everybody was asleep and nobody could see the embarrassment. That's okay guns are great But drugs are evil and people and have anything to do even I wonder what I have what happened to Columbus She would have had a little weir something in her suitcase there come the back from Paris Poor Columbus bush all she did was try to like smuggle in about $20,000 worth of stuff that you bought and the boy having to pay the goddamn duty on it. I say Doody on hers what I say But if it would have been some schlepper that would have come in would like a half an ounce of weed from Amstever and somewhere straight to jail baby drug smugglers 15 years easy We're talking crazy people is what we're talking about and we're talking about this hypocritical double So it's like the thing with Baba and Monica you know with the blow jobs, you know airbie every guy in this country wants blow jobs Believe me what I tell you Everybody in this country wants to get head, but oh my god if the president's doing it then we got to have an inquisition Then we got to have a big then he's a perfect. We got about big son of the ants because the president's getting some head I say if Al Gore would come on a year tomorrow and say hey guess what I like to get good head Just as much as Baba his pool ratings with his pool would rise and his ratings too That's right And by the way, I hate to break the news to those Nazis on Sunday morning on ABC or still given a song to dance about how Hillary Clinton is behind Hey, they break the news here New York Daily News. I bought it to your port in Toronto yesterday Tell her is eight points ahead But don't confuse George Willam, all those other factions on the Sunday morning our fascism Let ABC with the truth because they're in their papapapapia I'm manipulating public opinion in that cookie Roberts She should only croak be criminalized put in Florida Yeah Moon Oh Oh Alright. Hey, everybody in their brother in this country. They talk one game and they want their lives to be another. But it just all sounds great. Here's a classic example of what goes on in this country. How juvenile we are from El Segundo, California. Mattel incorporated is changing the packaging of its Tars and action figure. After some people said the doll's movements were sexually suggestive. How do you like that? Tarsan, he's doing it. Raising the right arm of the 30 centimeter high, rad repeat in Tarsan, switches on and recording of his jungle deal. The problem is that the springloaded arm can be pumped rapidly up and down from Tarsan's chest to below his loincloth, a motion some people call it suggested. That's why he's making those sounds, baby. What do you think he's yelling about? Squirt, squirt, exactly. Although nobody has complained that the company Tarsan's performance has been noted in messages on seminar chat rooms since that I'll restore three weeks ago. The jerkin Tarsan. He's jerkin is jerkin and everybody's excited about it. I think this is where adult look at things through a different set of eyes. Mattel spokesman Sarah Rosalay said yesterday, no changes if it made to the ballot self, however the company's making sure the arm will be secured in the open front package. So it cannot drop a load Tarsan's waist while the toy is still in the store. Once you take it home, he can puff away like crazy, okay? Until he's in the prone position and passed out. But other than that in the store, we don't want Tarsan's hand, but it sounds like a drone Crawford thing, you know? Or she used to tie her kids hands behind his back when they went to bed at night because God forbid his hands should slip under his waist. We're got Tarsan. He'd like to swing from the guy named Ropan a jungle, but we got his hands tied again, okay? Like everybody else. That's what Duff Lindsey said. I'd like to get more done around here, but my guy named Handsard died. And he seems to be enjoying it. Here's a fact that since Jeff loves license plates so much, here's a new one for him. Choose to pay import duty. There you go. Choose life and why you're ready. Choose to pay import duty. Ouch! Bitch! How do you like that? All these foamy luck I told you. Henry hired his hide in it. Dan Coats, he was hired in it. The more they talked, the more they're full of crap, and the more skeletons you'll find, all of them. Not just in their closet, every room in a house. Even the tea room they got closet swinging from the ceiling. Here's a mobile in a cable. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. How are you today? Great. Listen, I was watching the news over the weekend, and I've the only person that realized this at the Russians when it's possible to hold the phone. They went into Kosovo to hold us hostage and have debts reduced. Did you hear about that? So what about this? Well, I think it's bogus. They're doing the same thing. They did in a second world war. They all had a sector of Germany. They got it. Yeah. They wanted a piece. Everybody wants a piece and the Russians want a piece. Have you ever seen those Russian women? I would like to see that out there. That's why they left Russia. That's why they want a piece someplace else. Excellent points sir. God bless you. 560560, ponp 560 on a mobile one line. It's going to be a long, ponderous week, but it doesn't bother me. Because I know that most people from down here, there's someplace else. Having a really good time. And God bless them. Here's a mobile in deer fields. Hello. Hey, me. Okay sir. Listen. Did you know that two weeks ago in Miami at the FACC? No. There was a conference by the National Association of Drug Court Professionals. Do you know what a drug court is all about? About what? What professional? National Association of Drug Court Professionals. No. Well, drug courts. The very first one was seven years ago in Miami. And they've been tracking it ever since. And it's grown to the point where we're about 400 of them operating in this country right now. So what? What? Drug courts. Now tell you what drug court is. When someone gets charged with a drug offense, a nonviolent non-dealer drug offense. Yeah. Sometimes they're given the option of going to drug court. Where instead of putting them in jail, they're given a option of not an option. Like it's up to the judge into the case worker and the prosecutor of either going for probation with random drug screening or to refering them to inpatient or outpatient treatment. Yeah. They're referring them to Trump stuff, you know, recovery fellowships. But here at the kick. They've been tracking us for seven years. And the reason why they're backing it now. And it was part of the National Drug Control Policy. I mean, my campary was that this convention. Yeah. Where we got to spend on drug court. They're saving $10 on incarceration. And it's criminal justice system. Yeah. So all things really not about what's best for the person has got a drug problem. So about $1. And as long as they're attitude is how they're going to save money and not how we're going to deal with the problem. They're never going to deal with the problem. So I just want to let you know. And we were angry that it was literally like, well, well, we used to say the problem first of all. It's a problem that they created. Well, when you say the problem first of all, it's a problem that they created. If you're talking about people that are like hooked on heroin or have cocaine brought out problems to the point where they're like, you know, ripping off 7-11's and gas stations, yeah, then there's a problem. Well, you know, if you allow 10 tons of stuff to come into Miami every month, you know, someone's just... 10 tons of what? Of whatever. Of weed. Of weed. Of marijuana. Of weed. Of weed. Some of the citizens are going to get screwed up. With what? With drugs. With weed. So, man. You won't wish that it doesn't matter, okay? Doesn't. How about a regular, well, that's a two? No. Huh? Oh, my God. This guy's got too much time on his hands. This will the TYME with an H? Give me a break already. William. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6. I understand. You can't have a conversation about this in this country because like I've told you before. Most of what's in the mind for the American public has been planted there by somebody else. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. They've been very well brainwashed. Not bad enough. We're going to have the 10 commandments. You know, want to walls at all those schools. That's really going to change a lot, isn't it? No. But now we got the polite police in Louisiana. And the kids have to say, yes sir. And yes, man. That's you're going to change a lot of things. They had one as you came around and just more and talking about. And of course, what we see is always at the bottom of the list. Even worse than Florida and per capita spending for students. The worst education system in America. They got no classrooms. They got no textbooks. They got no teachers that can say, you know, say, a spell or name. But the kids would be more polite. Now I say put them in nice little brown uniforms and have the little goose steps. Sounds good. Yes sir. Yes sir. Yes, man. Whatever you say, sir. Teach them how to put that arm up in the air to 45 degree angle. Yes sir. Good little obedient Nazis. That's going to do it. Just calm down. Okay. Just don't expend all your energy on another place. 21 before 11 at 5. 60 WQM. In fact, when you get all worked up like I am right now, the best thing to do is take a deep breath, sit back. Put a nice big round when you're pushed from next to the guards. And just say, it's good, you know? Just say, that's right. That's what I'm going to do. It changed the world. Just sit here and do the best you can. So light upon those great predominant reserve actors. Or one of those Cuban bullets. Yeah. Speaking of a field alley, even he never had a Cuban bullet. Once that one, I will not have that idea. Neil. God. You feel me, thanks. Love my love. Ah, I know that you keep on taking up my love. Don't play me, come tell me. You can't help my breath. So can I must study here? Alright. You come on to me and let the things in my head. And it sounds so hard. But if you wanna take me slow, the thing is about me, don't think you know. I'm on the way. Yeah. You should make it a day. So you could go to Canada to be with me. It's a free. You live a friend on me. She was 25 but she's just a team. Look at me. I've been my life a dream. Daddy called her. I've got some perfectity. Because I've got some to be. You're not my cousin. Which money do you want? And I've got some things right now. Oh, my show. She's on the way. She's okay. She's on the way. She's just a kid. Yeah, the men's role in those grandmothers and daughters. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. I'm not a kid. Hey, 46 and 560 WCWM. So anyway, here's a fact. This goes to show you the kind of idiots that we have out through the so-called sports band. Wait until you're this fact. From Lone Star 22, he calls himself a ball, whichever one he's calling himself today. It says, who is the Stanley Cup champion? The Dallas stars underlined with a whole bunch of crap. Does anybody care here? Oh, no. I know you don't agree with the goal I was scored. It's not a question whether I agree with it. The goal shouldn't have counted. Not a credit. It's not a good. It's not like a multiple choice question. Okay. Was it a goal I should have stood? No. But all I've heard you say all season. Too bad. If the role is where he versus you'd be saying just that today. Too bad. If Dallas didn't earn the last goal too bad. How do you like that? So in other words, a Stanley Cup championship they play four freaking rounds. You have to win 28 games to win or whatever it is. 16 games. Four seven games series to win a goddamn Stanley Cup. And it's idiot because his team wanted or a support from the Carlos Cach de Beton a guy in game. He's happy that they won regardless of who was a greasy go on. You're in the counted. Nice. Go on. Gary Betman. You idiot. You simple. Then compute. Idiot. Here's a call from Texas. What about this is about? Yes sir. I just want to let you know that missed you very much. I was formerly from Miami, Florida. You were formerly from Miami? Yeah. I got transferred over here for federal agents and here in the valley. Yeah. Protecting our borders here. Just want to let you know that. You don't want any more of those next to Cansin. No, no, no. I'm not going to drug agent. Yeah. And I just want to, you know, our mayor want to find this incredible. Where are you guys? These are just up to 500 to 6000 pounds a day. What do you mean our problem is incredible? What's the problem? Oh, the mayor want to problem. That's what we're not. No, no, but what is the problem? Hello. I'm sorry. Are you listening to me? Yes, I am. Somebody say hello. Why not? We said hello like two minutes ago. I'm a telephone. Yeah. And it's kind of a, okay. Okay. Cutting out. Okay. Let me say again. What is the mirror want to problem? Is that like re for madness? Is that the problem? No, you know what? It's not the problem. And so, you know, the problem is the trafficers. That's the problem. And those are the ones that you get into heavy, healthy and, uh, uh, punishment. But those are the ones who are behind bars. Exactly. And last night's a roller show that kept calling the drug kingpins. And most of the drug kingpins aren't the, in fact, the two black women they had who were in jail for 17 and 20 years. They said, I don't even know any blood drug kingpins. Uh, you know, I just made one mistake. And I'm in here for 17 years and one case and 20 years and the other can't get out. So people that are getting arrested are not the drug kingpins. Yeah. So then what are you guys doing? So what's it all about? Well, I think it looked good for the public. So people are scared talking so they're not going to, they're not going to, So so then what's the point? Exactly. Why not put the drug kingpins out of business by legalizing, or at least be criminalizing it like they do in any place else with a guy brain and they take away their whole industry. You know, this, this is just like how we made all the money for the mafia, you know, prostitution, gambling, all the stuff, you know, when we had the prohibition with booze, all the stuff that the public wants and the government will let them have. That's where the mob makes all their money. Well, you know what, the thing about marijuana, it's something that it still hasn't been completely started because marijuana is a gateway drug to other drugs. Oh, just like alcohol's a gateway drug. Just like having a beer is going to make you an alcoholic. You know how old and stale that argument is sir? But you know what, you know what, you know, marijuana's more normal. It's you and how come with all the people smoking pottenin in the Netherlands? They don't have all these other drug problems. How come that is? Because they don't have access to the other drugs as much as much as they don't. They're how they don't. They're how they don't. But it is very controlled by the drug. And how come in all these countries in Western Europe or the drinking age? Some countries they don't even have a drinking age. How come they're all running around stone out of their minds all day and drunk driving like we are here? So I hate to break the news, do you see or there's something called the forbidden food? And when you try to prohibit people from having something that they want, then they want it even more. Because it makes it, you know, that much more glorified. How long have these cultures been exposed to the drinking and no age? You know, they've got to the whole world. For instance, law for instance, God made little renapples. That's right. Anyway, you know what happens if we legalize it now? We have a couple of hundred years where it's going to be horrible. And then maybe we're talking about marijuana? Yeah. Couple of hundred years it's going to be horrible. People are going to be holding up convenience stores and gas stations so they can go on by marijuana. And then eventually we'll be stable. I was like, just send to your fingers. Sir, are you, are you, are you, we have an conversation. When's the last time you heard of somebody holding up a goddamn convenience store so you get money to buy marijuana? About crack. I'm talking about, we're not talking about, okay. We're talking about marijuana. Okay, so cheap right now, you don't have to do that. Okay, thanks. We'll give us some numbers. Okay. Give us some phone numbers. We got a whole building to supply here. Okay, thank you, sir. Hey, well, there's one of your DEA people calling from Texas allegedly. Oh, my God. I rest my case. Oh, we're going to have 200 years of hell here. Let's get that re-for-madness thing out again. Okay. Crazy people is what we're talking about. What a fix. Let's just be gifted. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh. Hmm. Hmm. But anyway, don't get so kind of upset because like I said before, it's a whole DEA, the whole concept of it. It's another one of those bureaucracies that has to justify its existence. And so as a result, we got assholes like this guy saying all of these things, you know. Here's a tamarack, hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. Listen, something you just thought you're well ago. I'm a Broward County school teacher. Yes. I will never. I don't care what the state set. I will never post a tank of monuments from my classroom. Never. All the Catholic. Right. But there's something in this country that when this country was founded, called the Constitution. Mm-hmm. That's the separation of church and state. I was watching these two bird brains the other day on CNN, who was it? Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson. Oh, my God. Saying that Jews and mufflings are going to go to hell because they don't believe in Jesus Christ. Can you believe that? Yes, I can. Of course. I think. How? And this country believes in these people. Like this the Asian that Jesus has. Yeah. It's not. I mean, help. Bird brain can be God. I've been doing hundreds of hell here if we had to criminalize marijuana. It's not his education. We're going to have people like just staggering around all over the place. And it's a gateway drug to bigger drug. Right. Right. Like a beer will strike you into booze, right? That's like something that if I eat a can, if I eat a can, a Franco-American spaghetti, I'm going to become a pasta freak. All those wine drinking, Italian, you've been in Italy. Help me. That's in the ocean in the oldest trada because there were drunk. That's correct. You know, the public drunken is so frowned upon and all of Italy. I've never seen anybody staggering around drunk there. And oh, I've been there 60 times. Never seen it once. I mean, I'm American. I feel I'm a, I'm a shame. The new bit to the bird brains in this country. In fact, you know, remember, leave it to Bieber. We got a new show. It's called Leave it to the Bird brains. Yeah. You want to be the new show now. You see what Congress did with the gun control. Yes. It's on the list. They give us the Buffon rule of 130 in a morning. Right about the same time the hockey game ended tonight. Later, they gave it to nobody was watching, right? Thank you. Nobody was watching. That's right. I mean, it's incredible. Okay, I'll see you with your real pot support though. Let me tell you. I'll be the first one in front of the Supreme Court saying to Ben, to 10, come on. Just say no to the 10 commandment. No. Now, I'm going to put something, what I don't only have to have a big sign. That says DNA ton of water. It's good enough. Really? In my classroom, I don't only have Catholics to have Jews. At bufflings too. Well, they're all going to burn and hell anyway. That's right. Okay. I'll see you there. See you later. Bye-bye. See you all in hell, because that's where I'll go and hey, by the way, Pat Robertson, here's a message for you. Go to hell. Yeah. Of course, we got to have the uniforms. We got to have the kids at yesterday, yes sir. I mean, the teacher respect is one thing. Of course, anybody with a brain of views with that because we have like Madness going on in the schools today. But here's another one of the big stories over the weekend. Not nice. She'd come as a great surprise, of course, to all of us. Athletes get a free ride teacher say. Four more are claim grades altered. Isn't this like something new and, oh, yeah. But going on since before, like I said before, Moses was an infant. In the wake of a Harold reports documenting and played a grade to prominent athletes, court and former teachers at Central, New Orleans and Jackson High School, say that F that they assigned a football and basketball players were changed to B. Oh, hey, and F looks a little like a B, you know? There's a service. How do you be? How you be doing? F's were changed to B's because when you're a jockey, don't have to go to class, you go to win surfing maybe once a week. That's about it in between like turning the sprinklers on in the morning. And that's all you got to do. Bunch of hypocrites a bunch of phony baloney, but if we say yes sir and yes man, everything's going to be just funky door. Oh, we're talking. That's the American way. Very simplistic idiotic superficial solutions to otherwise complex. Demanding problems. That's the way to do it. Just like Nancy Reagan said, just say, oh, yeah. Just say no to drugs. Just say no to sex. Just say no to everything. Okay. No to booze. Well, we should have done was just said, Oh, and auntie and Ronnie, that's what we should have done. Just like this other. Yeah, and let me say it again. Here we got this guy. This bush is waiting in the wings. We got the one here in Florida already. Whose wife is this smuggling and all kinds of stuff here. $20,000 flying through a teeth. And they're supposed to set an example. See, I'd rather have a governor just like bubble up there. I'd rather have a governor's getting blow jobs every couple of days. Okay. Then worry about a governor whose wife is trying to avoid paying her fair share, which they got more money than God, by the way, the bush family. They got more money than God. That's for God damn sure. And she don't want to pay her fair share. She's breaking a freaking law, okay. But God forbid, like I said before, if somebody should be bringing an 1.5 ounce from the Netherlands or somewhere else, they're going straight to God damn jail. Probably for like 10 to 15 easy. Here's David, hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. You stole a little bit of my funder. I want to dimension about the governor's wife. I read that article this week and sank demonious bitch. I kind of turned in a little late. I know that interesting article I was in the paper. Did you read the thing on the will of fair? Oh, yeah. Oh, that's the little one. I'm so glad you reminded me. Jerry Falwell says the will of fair. Oh, wait. I've got that somewhere. That's a little bit. Whoo. This is a conspiracy of the demons are behind the will of fair. Yes. Oh. I wasn't bad enough that the Tiki Winky turned out to be a faggot, but now we got the will of fairs. A bunch of demons and goblins. Give a women. Oh my God. Thanks for reminding me, sir. I heard you talking about the peace this weekend. The drug problem. Right. I think it was said best when you said that America has lost the role on drugs, but we've never surrendered. Yeah. That's not a good piece. As much as people make fun of us. I'll be over there. Yeah. That's pretty good work. It was great. In closing, I'd like to make a request. Yes, sir. Erection. Okay. Thanks. I owe an Erection. I'm not a kick off my shoes. Drop off my dress. It makes me wet when I see you get a big Erection. That's a great form of my mouth. I want it. Merchants every end on top of you. And take it out my looper. I hated poop too. Reck them. Yes. We have an Erection. Oh, no. I'm not a rat. Hey, I'll be through the wall. Here are E.P.T.I.O.S. I want to drink our ball. I want to laugh and walk the out of me when you do the dirty. And that'll give it a blow. Here's a morning basis. And take it. As we just fill the youth, take up the sum on a record on the surround. You're closing too. And make your wonder for a big club with food. That sum in red. And it's on circle side. E-R-E-C-D-I-O-L-N. I want to drink our ball. I want to know three or five dishes. I'm going to go over some of the food that's been thrown away. I'm going to go over that thing because that's been a lot of time. I got that schedule out. I'll leave you close. Pick at it. We got you mad dog mad at 6 to 10. Yeah. I'm going to have a couple of 10 o'clock. So no ball game today. Oh, thank God for that. How about those marlins, baby? Doing it every day they're doing it. Day after day after day. Here's a thanks by the way. It says, I hope that Jack has caller who doesn't have the guts to respond to you when you ask him about marijuana. It's happy every day when he knows that people like that poor black woman would absolutely no criminal record. Are running in a cell for almost 20 years when she could be a productive member of society. That guy is exactly what's wrong with his country. A brainwashed robot just repeating something he's heard like a good little parrot. I'd like to know if any case in which someone who was high and marijuana went for circumcried to gouges eyes on Robah 711, got into a fight with somebody in a bar. Shot somebody, etc. And so on. I sincerely hope that somebody pants drugs on your ass. And you can rot and jail for a change. We'll all be better off without you. And you also has a thing here about milk. That's right. Milk is a gateway substance. And when you start feeding your kids milk as little children, they're going to start becoming hooked on God damn dairy. Right. All their lives are going to be going around. Spit it all at God damn heavy flim up because when you eat a lot of dairy, nonstop plums we'd already put it at right now. Gateway drug. See these are the kinds of cliches that America loves, the kind of mindless horse crap rhetoric stupid idiotically shades. Oh, if you have a, you know, it gets good curre nation back. So she can break a bottle over your God damn head sur. Because let's face it anybody that takes a drink of a beer, a sip, a goddamn martini is going to become a raving out of control alcoholic. Running out there in his car just killing people left and right. Anybody that even even in hails like I mean, God, that Bubba didn't inhale. We'd have already been dropping nuclear weapons all over the world if he wouldn't hail one puff. God, what kind of invicels are we talking about? A country that refuses to grow up. How many times have I told you that? And by the way, you know, something I thought about it during a break in a white dollar span, I'd say I'll take it to you. You're right about that, but I'm not. And the fact that I was rooting for Buffalo that makes me even more pissed off, but if you're going to decide a championship, don't do it on a bogus call like that. How many times have I been holding just have a toll in the creeds? Happiest skaters in the crease that piece of crap bread hall. Okay, can't stand them. You play till one thirty in the fricking morning and you let's think if decided on a bogus call, go. Nice going, Gary. I would say send them back to Cornell, but I found out that they won't take them. 560, 5050, 5060 on the mobile one line. Here's Hialia, hello. Body, come. Okay, thank you. That's his weekly contribution of the show. Here's a pay phone in Miami Beach, hello. That was a very weak one, two yes sir. Yes, come on in, you know. Are you aware of the pay of history of Columbia Bush's family as far as the Columbia? Is that an organt? Columbia. How come it's filled with no eyes as Columbia? Columbia, okay. Anyway, Columbia. Why don't we just refer to her from here on in, you know, as a f***ing bitch. I would make it easier. But is there any way that the her family was caught laundering drug money to Costa Rica years ago? Yeah. I don't know if you're familiar with it or not. All right. Some of you listeners might be, well, some maybe it runs in a family, small room stuff in. Right. But I've ran with the crap that you bought in Paris that you don't want to pay you in for duty on. Anyway, it was a number of years ago. I remember hearing about that and I just wanted to bring that to attention. Yeah. And there might be some more, for it. And D pills are, you know, some follow up on that too. Well, what's there is going to make? Well, just, well, nobody cares about that. Stop nobody cared in the first place when this guy four years ago ran as a goody two shoes as a pawn of the religious right. And now all of a sudden we're supposed to believe that he changed his spot like a goddamn leopard. Right. No, it's just, you know, it's whatever somebody's exposed to, you know, like that. It's, you know, it's just kind of a work to general public about that, you know, but I don't see anybody that's worked here. I don't know. It seems to give a crap. I don't want any other. Well, you're, you're, you're the only one who cares. Yeah, what? And what are the things? I think I'm going to make a rule change in the, the hockey next year about the, Yeah, but two lights for this year. I understand. I know it's too late. Anyhow, nice talking to you. And have a great day. Only the National hockey league, like I said, whatever championship decided on a bogus cool, nice going Gary. You little asshole you. No, we don't have any outrage about that. The probably, you know, they're more conservative studies going out there and smoking a little bit of weed. That's evil. But if the governor's wife is trying to smuggle in about then lying about it, that's the best part. She gets caught with her gun day of pantalones now and she lies about it. It makes a bulk kinds of stories. How come harasses and then jail by the way? She lied and said that this was the, the receipts that they found were for old purchases. Then they go through her luggage and find out that it's not for old purchases. That the stuff is in there. And she has to pay a $4,100 civil fine. How about how about attempting a smuggle of stuff and put her ass in jail? I say, let the two black women out there run the goddamn horror show and NBC lies. Let them out of jail and put the governor's wife in it. Is what I say. How do you like that? Yeah. Let's take a pull on that. Let's put the fucking bitch right in there behind bars where she belongs. St. Demonius, like I said before, hypocritical assholes and they're the ones that are running the country where everybody else is out there playing Majong. That's the problem. They're playing shuffleboard and Majong down here. And the rest of the country are too busy trying to find a good weed. I see if they would decriminalize it and they could go out of the cannabis kind of stores like they have an Amsterdam. They're walking and, you know, or they go into the neighborhood cafe and they're a little brown cafe. Yeah, that one. And that's it. No big song and a dance. They give them a little menu. What's the son of a man you did that? Here you go. You know what I'm talking about? You're not here. Why do I speak to those Jamaicans? Wow, I read something yesterday. I don't want to get our Jamaican friends upset the boy. I know that the Lord even loves New Rogers. This is Robert St. One of the most best unsolved mysteries of our time. Namely, who and what? This thing they call the Will of Fair. What's with the name? Where does it come from? It's the actually a fair of this group. You know, Roger Gaines and a prize for the largest water. Will on this case, maybe the largest milk. So, no. I recently visited the Will of Fair and couldn't find a single fair swim. Not even a single sheep's sharing contest or homemade apple pie. And who is this elusive Will of it? The only love a scientist can come up with is the old TV series The Monsters. Could she be part of this fair? And if so, where are the rest of the monsters? Get me in her mental festests. After some intense investigation, appears that the Will of Fair is not a fair at all. A bunch of screaming women trying to form a singing group. Except that none of them stay on the group long enough to make it work. So, to revolve in door of different women getting together from town to town to try to get it right. Jesus, what's wrong? Don't they pay enough for the conditions too bad to stay for longer than a gig? A ton of who this man is worse than being hellin'. Question remains, whatever happened in a stable woman singing band. Like Diana Watson, the Centrey, the Sherel, the four of the sisters. What a no-no-no-no religious band. Sister Hazel, she sounds pretty nice. This note from Mrs. Stack regarding the Will of Fair. Do you think the lines for the ladies' room and a regular concert along? Try the Will of Fair. Every door she hits at employees' own. Everyone! Cheddo Sebastian, find for a job! Somebody has an answer. Who advice them? Help is women can get their acts together. Call me hero amongst some mysteries. It's a goddamn conspiracy, baby. The feeling that the witches and the cobbles of the devil just asked Jerry, he'll tell you. Oh! 1115 at 5. So if you think out of these religious people aren't like you into a lot of boo-doo and superstition and hockess Pocus? Because like in a radio, we do a lot of hockess pocus groups. Here's a call from Dallas. It's been on there for a long time waiting to glow. Hello? I'll take it too. Yeah. Sorry, I just wanted to call him. Paul just for that game. Yeah, it was bad. Well, you know, we had a great series going on. We haven't seen it in like this. I mean, what's the point of playing for like 4.5 hours when you're going to end a goal on a game on a goal that shouldn't account it? Shouldn't account it. We feel bad. That's no you don't. For hate's calling on and on and on. Right, huh? Uh, no, no. I'm always be tainted. There always be an actress next to it in the record books and greasy goal. I'd like to put everybody back on the ice and gone back and continue to gain. Because that was unfair. I think they should do that. I think you could go back to Buffalo tonight. Finish the game play as long as they have to until somebody scores. And then if Buffalo does win and still come up again, seven and Dallas tomorrow. Exactly. We'd like to see that. I want to see seven games. I'm not, uh, not slushy. You got their past office ice, you know? Well, they put some new coolers in to keep the hot air out, but that's really not helping. No. That just wanted to kind of apologize for that one and actually feel a little bit better. Maybe San Antonio's stomping next. And maybe that one will be fair and thanks to the last one the one. Okay. Have a great time, pal. Thank you. Okay. I'm not going to be wanted about because I don't do I keep a crap about the next. No, about San Antonio. Oh, about it's going to go a sweet. No, care couldn't care less. That's full ball. That's for the dark folks. Okay. They got to have their thing. 560, 0560, pound five 60 on the AT&T waters line. Speaking of the dark folks athletes and I'm sure not all of them were dark, but some of them may have been get a free ride. Going back to that great story again. Does anybody care about that? It's been going on for a long time. Goes on college goes on in high school. Pretty soon. It's going to be going on elementary school. I'd say I caught 12 grade changes over the past eight years. As the year says Mike Banzo 34, who taught health and lifestyle management. Health and lifestyle management. That's like win surfing at Northern Jackson before resigning in 1998 to go on a one year sabbatical. He said, I'm going to student athlete and F or D in miraculously. A C rugby would appear on a pork car. It's like a miracle. I'm actually like you went ahead something to do with that. You see, if you just believe in the Lord, that after ends into a beat. Oh, my. Because the Lord works in the serious way is the Lord likes the student athletes, especially the athlete part. You don't care so much about the student part. He likes the job part. The Lord is a jox niffer. All right. That's why I need locker rooms always painted the Lord. Or like Chris Antley said, if God would want it as to win today. Five six. Good one. Five six seven. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line. And what do I tell you about the government's wife? Does anybody care about this? Oh, I won't go ahead. That's to the people ought to be up at arms about this. They don't care. They couldn't give a crap less. Here's a mobile in West Palm. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How's your weekend? Great. Good one. Great. Listen, oh, that was a fast when you pulled on everybody Friday. That was a good one. What do you mean by that? You never said you were leaving it. I don't say that. Why should I say I'm going to be leaving it 12 30? Because then there might be a few people out there that don't want to give Georgia chance that he didn't like poison because. Oh, it's great. Because they think he's going to come on here and rip his mother in an ass, which he did. You know, so why should I promote it? It's like holding up a flag, you know? I know. It was great. That's what I'm in. That's the way I like to do it. Yeah, it first of all, that Jerry Farwell, he's an asshole. Second of all, you had spoke about a study that some college had done a couple months ago that Merra wanted to not lead to harder drugs. Right. I don't remember what school I was going to back here somewhere. Right. You know, I mean, he's a gateway drug. Don't you understand it's a gateway drug. People are going to be going crazy. They're going to be doing cocaine. They're going to be doing heroin. It's going to be through the glue. It's like the one guy called Irly and said the guy's just a robot. Man, he just goes by whatever the government tells us. They're all I can tell you. He's a total absolute asshole. Yeah, he doesn't want to know. He's working for that bureaucracy, which like I said before, they have to pray that the stuff keeps on coming in because it's selling, you know, it tastes self-sustaining thing. They have to continue, you know, justifying their ongoing existence. Right. And as far as the governor's wife, man, I mean, that's just, if that was you or me, we would've been like, we'll straight to jail. Straight to jail, man. That's BS. That's right. That's just to be in jail right now. Two other things. And a people on this state don't care. How do you like that? They're worried about public getting a couple of blind jobs on the side, which is his business. It doesn't affect anybody else in any way shape or form. But here's a woman who's the wife of the governor of this state. And they can and is more realistic, holier. Good at two shoes. Holier than now, bull crap, but there's, and she's trying to smuggle in 20 grand and line through a teeth. I know, man, like I said, if it was you or me, we would've covered it. If you were in perfume down at bitch. Right. We would've been in jail with the two black girls. That's why I show off time. Wasn't bad. The one who wrote the dead. Wasn't bad. That's a great show. He's ever done in his life. It goes to show it like I said, if you do 50,000 shows, eventually you'll do a good one. Yeah, was a shame. Yeah, was a shame. I'm glad you guys that on this station. Was ashamed that the drugs are sitting there saying that all this money that they spend for go fast boats and all that, but not one. He's he was saying 50% and it was way less than 50% of their spending on people who who want to break the habit of heroin and all that other stuff. And this people waiting for beds and they just basically tell me, come back in six weeks. Right. And then we want to kid on the skateboard that's going out and making another crime. You know, two things. And because of all that stuff, can we hear the thing about, can we hear a Duane stop about alcohol? No. Okay. That's cool. And clothing, Wayne is a big black guy and he's a douchebag. Okay. Thanks. And you're welcome. 560, I'd like to see some passion out of these people. I'd like to see the people getting pissed off in the governor's life. Didn't this guy get elected based on his moralistic who all is bull crap? And are going to be worried about education. That's a good example by the way for the youngsters in this state. And while they're worried about Tom women, what to do with their bodies. And all these two life license plates that they're going to be making this fall. And probably, you know, saying, take up for the abortion clinic. Can't mind around God damn business, but when it comes to their own business, they just can't clean up their act. Can't clean up their act. They should be like on a front page. They should be a major, major scandal. And instead, you got to like somebody had a fact this to me because I was out of town on Saturday. It's probably like, very, very who the hell knows where. First lady declined a chance to amend declaration. So wasn't bad enough she lied in a first chance, but then when they gave her an opportunity to say, Now, you sure about this? Maybe you forgot about all this stuff that your suitcases are loaded with. Who is we found all these receipts for this crap that you bought? Oh, no, she lied about that too. That was on some of my previous trips, which got only noticed by the way, how much she smuggled in on those trips that she didn't pay in for duty on. God. Like I said before, all you young people out there that kids are out of school for how many young people listening just remember that people who screamed allowed is to want to make the most noise about being goodly too shoes and better than all arrest of us. Those are the people you better look out for. Better hide your candy in your goddamn marbles in your pennies when you see those to your piggy bank because when those people capture are coming you got real problems. Here's a. What's Palm Beach? Hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. My name is Chris Nielsen and I'm HIV positive. Yes, and I'm living proof to marijuana works. Right. I've been HIV positive since I'm 12. Right now I'm 25. Incredible. And I've been smoking since I was 16 and it helps out a great deal. Right. With the eating and everything and I can't believe these these asshole who. And it's a devil drug and it and leads to other things. Yeah, reformedness, baby. If that were true, then all the old foot, all the old hippies should be rockets by now. Right. That's right. Oh, God. Have a good day. Okay. Good luck Chris. And there look what it did for Dan Quayla. Oh, that's pop that he was smoking. I got that guy locked up in jail and Texas somewhere that they are trying to keep his quiet as possible. I hope maybe he'll cork someday real soon before all the work gets out about the. Special now the Danny boys running for persons again. Oh, my god. Five, six, seven. And of course, blah, blah, blah. Well, I tried it once but I didn't inhale. Right. I didn't inhale my fat ass. Okay. But these are the kinds of lies because the American public too immature to deal with the truth because they've been sufficiently brainwashed. You almost get to feeling like just like clockwork horns. They've all been sat down in a big gigantic movie theater and had the toothpicks stuck at their eyelids to make sure that they keep their eyes open long enough to watch reform madness over and over and over again. All these things that go on like in civilized and civilized work, which I keep trying to tell you about. And this D.E.A. guy. Oh, yeah, but how long have they been doing this for forever and ever? But we'd have to go through 200 years of hell here first. Well, thank God that we don't have any of that going on now that nobody is smoking weed in this country yet. So if they ever get the idea, here's West Palm Beach, shallow. How you doing? Pretty good sir. Well, you know, you're talking about Bush. You know what happened? How many people do you know can pay $4,000 right there for nine of check? That's why she didn't get locked up. Because they got more money than God and that's the point she's trying to say if she's trying to cheat the guy named government or the money that she's supposed to pay on the import duties and she can afford to pay the $4,100 grant because they've got more money than Jesus and Moses. That's right. She pays $4,000. There are numbers too. The referees in the hockey game. You can find out who they're betting. That's how you know who's going to win. They bet the game. They're literally there. You mean beans. They got to make a bet. Okay. Well, call up any cable. Find out tonight where they're betting. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless line. And of course, the people listen to this radio station. This like when a big scandal with Miami high came down with a bank's football. And there are all these people calling it. Oh, you know, these poor kids. You're going to destroy their careers. Well, what is that all about? Destroy their careers. Like when that girl up in Paparoba, you know, when I hit and run the thing that they did there, oh, you know, she was a promising student athlete. How about the person that she killed. Yes. How come I can't hear what you're saying? They still get recruiting good at major universities. The ones from the Miami high basketball team. Yeah. It's a spending. They still got recruited. Oh, thank God. We didn't screw up their careers. Oh, I feel better now. Oh, thank God. Because the last thing we want to do is screw up some student athlete. Okay. That's the mentality of the jobs that prisoners got in town in this country. Because that's the important stuff. If somebody were in a jockstrap, that's the important stuff in America, right? Getting the goddamn education, having a brain larger than a goddamn, uh, your toenail. That's not important. And we just can't figure out why all this crap is going down. Can we? Can't wait for that George Foreman, a Tyson fly, huh? Can't wait for that. I bet you George hits him over and headward one of his goddamn leeming grill and machine. That's gone, George. There you go. Chop is guy damn ear off with your leeming grill and machine. Oh! And you know something? Some of you assholes out there. You're going to pay to watch it. That's the best part. That's the part I love. The only sister though. And you will. You'll pay to watch it. If my tensor on there fighting the Taco Bell Chihuahua, there are guys out there that will pay to watch it. Oh, my God. You. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was more than, among this dream it was a false sea, and she told me when I was so intrigued. I see you don't want to in this journey is enthringeneless and they'll go. I sat in the garden nice and seen some beautiful stories about your thoughts. Being cathed by sweet distrust turns out that there ain't a very old принимanté that we've filled with. Yes. Usually we can go and go. Mother well, we still meet the devil to do. Don't let your career head for a fall. Yes. And mother well, we still meet my goal you set it down. And of all the chats you can't see on the way this one of all. And she was like, I'm on a... Get just a go and set up our dear love. But here's what I'm from your train, son. We're on a land of people. Okay, it's all in the 32 of the 560 WQA. So anyway, here's a fact from somebody that's pissed off by the way. It's about time we got some passions and emotional abuse banter. It's a downright admissions boistery attempt to smuggle goods in without paying duty. She lied to a federal officer when she said the receipts were all, which is also a federal crime. But choose life right. How about telling the truth you f***ing and then of course it's got the CU ward, which we see the next time. All right, there you go whoever sent this. Also by the way, in case you weren't impressed enough by the Haraldopiece last night, if you missed this, 2020, with the I can't speak 5 words the way it's supposed to be spoken by our Walters. 2020 and ABC last night had another great religious segment about that couple. Anybody see that? No, who were starving their baby to death because the father, the young guy who's the Chris, whatever whatever his name was, they're crazy people. Religious fanatics. All of the scriptures say to each spend all his time on the internet and as a result, they wouldn't feed the baby any meat. They wouldn't feed the baby any protein and the baby's like, I forget how 18 months old and it's always like about two ounces. And they had a chase them down and try to take the baby away and then they came and stole the baby out of the hospital and it make a long story short the government took their kids away. Crazy crazy religious fanatics. I mean the ward by itself fanatic. You get a religious fanatic, you do know what a crazy person. I'm talking about. And that is if that weren't good enough, when I finish watching that segment, I turn over to CNN and they're doing this millennium thing, you know, this, which is pretty interesting stuff. And they just happen to be on a gym, John stuff at that point. Jones town. Anybody want some cool aid? Oh, yeah, there you go. But I know it's only me. I'm just a trouble maker. I know that. Our letter to the editor and by the way, our friend at Total Floring who's a chronic factor. I already had this clip out. Okay, my friend, but thank you so much for facting it to us 800 times. Letter to the editor by Paul Viscobitch, Jr. and Weston in the paper this morning says, the philosopher Nietzsche might have had the right of the writer of the letter. God didn't help students to come by high in mind when he noted in the beginning God created man in his own image and ever since man has returned to compliment. An expectation that God should act as we want him, presumed he should be as wise as we are. Okay? But who are we to second guess the architect of the universe, the intelligence behind a law of science and mathematics and the creator of the cockroaches and the mosquitoes? Sometimes his actions don't make sense to us, but does this mean that he, with the capital H's bad or not existent? My Christian mother once explained to me that God wishes you this, the God's plan is like a complex tapestry he is weaving. What we see from the underside is incomplete and indistinct, but what he sees from his bad is point is marvelous in its beauty and perfection. If all his kids that got blown away, it was beautiful from his side, you know. The writer applies that God doesn't exist because he didn't intervene at Colomboin High as the writer wished him to. This denial of a supreme intelligence is as greatly perfeith as the belief that there is a God. Instead of giving up that, that would be like my sin that if you tell me there's 50,000 illegal aliens in the room right across to the window for me there, that if you tell me that, it just as much of a leap of faith or might as well say that they're not there, then Paul goes on to say, And wait till you hear this, instead of giving up this God concept, we should start caring about our fellow human beings to include the tolerance of their faith, even when it differs from our own. When that kind of start, is that going to start any time soon? No. And as far as caring about our fellow human beings, do we need a God bull crap to do that? No. And he's fairy tale, bubble micees, goblin, angel, no. Purgatory? No. The brain washed masses are asses, baby. Don't ever forget it. That's my best lesson, all you young people out there, number one, DNA's do no harm. That's all you need to know. It doesn't cost you a dime to join. And number two, the masses are asses. Just talking to Ronald this weekend, just the area where we get every major city in the country, you walk a downtown. Here are crazy people handing out religious pamphlets on three corners. Oh Jesus, this is coming. Jesus, this is coming. Scored score it all over the place. Get a mop. Crazy people. I mean, just look at them. They're like, yeah, exactly like that. Crazy people like that, Columbus Bush, you know. I just can't stand that so much. Yeah, neither. Here's four lotterdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. My name is Jim Cox. I'm a prominent Catholic. And I want to know why. Well, what does that mean? You're a prominent Catholic. What does that mean? What does that mean? Yeah. That means I'm a prominent member of the Catholic Church. And I thought, well, what is a prominent member? Is that like, as opposed to your ordinary pedestrian member of the Catholic Church? I come to church. I go to church every Sunday. I've been up. You know, I was raised as a good Catholic. We've been up. Were you bent down? I've been up. You've been raised as a good Catholic. Yeah, I'd like to father or two, make sure you're been up. But anyway, go ahead. I was raised as a good Catholic. And I, I stumbled upon the station. And I can't believe they actually that this on the air. Why is that? Think about. Why is that? Why is that? What am I speaking about that you don't like? You speak against God. Oh, so in other words, if I speak something that you don't believe, you can't believe it's on the air. You sound like some kind of a fascist to me. You have any concept of what your government is all about about freedom of speech? Yeah, but you don't need to be thinking about these kinds of things. Sir, I, I have a big, I don't speak about whatever I want to speak. How do you like that without your permission? I don't need you to call me and tell me what I should be speaking about. How do you like that? The young youth doesn't deserve to hear this. The young youth, how about the old youth? How about the young youth here in both sides? Also, I didn't make it up to Rome. I didn't like that, do it because you like to brainwash them. Don't you, sir? Brainwash, no one is giving people a chance. It's giving people a chance. They are a bunch of bubble micees in fairy tales. You can brainwash them and they can go out and keep reproducing like rabbits. Okay? And shooting abortion doctors. Isn't that what you want? No, I, what do you want? What do I want? I want peace and happiness on the surface. Yeah, well, I'm not going to be everybody. Okay, leave everybody alone. Cut the crap. He's a very prominent Catholic. There's no fact in the church. Well, we know that. Here's a fact that says, sorry. I'm talking about their hurricanes. When you're talking about the stars game, but I can't go over it. What do you think about the canes? Do I think about the canes? No, they're ugly. So I can't tell you about the canes. Okay? Nice going Jim Morris. Great. The atmosphere out there. Very collegiate, which is the way it's supposed to be. Here we go. Hurricane. There we go. You know, see, that's a college thing. If you want to do that, a college game. Your high school gives. Don't go to professional sporting events and go. Here we go. You know, whatever the team is. When I hear that, I know I'm dealing with a town where nothing but can do that. Okay. I'm trying to think of different sports venues of major league sporting events where you hear people go. Here we go. Yeah, card. No, I mean, come on. Come on. Grow up. I could just hear into Ronald out the Urcan of the center. Here we go. Maple Leaf. Here we go. Can you imagine that? No. Even at the macaruna. Are they going to tear we go? Panthers. No, they're not doing it. They're not doing it. So all you people want to feel better about yourselves because you have a lot of people who are going to be in the ball game. Great. Nice. But there's one thing I want to remind you though before you get too carried away. Okay. All right. Okay. Go. Anybody have a heart or a liver? Here. Here. Where when you go to Malawau every time you ask to use the tone and listen to you. And that's fine. But when you're going to do it for you. And then you have an emotional heart.

That is named. Is that scarier is it me? That you shouldn't be on the radio. Yeah. He can't. I get so much of that. I can't believe what I'm hearing. Well if you don't like it turn it off. If you're too much of an emotional cripple. Go, well, you know, find, go rub your rosary beads or something. Get out of my face. Go say a few dozen Hail Mary's. Yeah. Listen. I'm a paper today of that goal. He wasn't a crease wasn't he? Yes he was. You're answering me like it's debatable. Of course not. I'm a crease. How long I'm going to have this idiot as a commissioner of hockey until somebody rises up. Didn't the favors get screwed last year on a goal like that in a game? Yeah. Geez. Yeah. Jesus. That's terrible. I feel like I've been cheated of at least two or three hours of my life. In fact, the whole five hours that I invested watching from the pregame at 730 on a 30 until 130 that six hours of my life, I feel I had ripped off watching a first. I mean, what's the point? If you're not going to stick to the rules, what's the point you've been playing a goddamn game? That's terrible. What are our chances this year of maybe getting a linty rough back with a panther? Yeah. Okay. Why do one of the people say these things? Why do they do? Yeah. We're going to get a linty rough back and then we're going to get a race shepherd's going to back and stew bars. And by the way for that jackass that call Hank two weeks ago. Another one of those hockey experts here in South Florida about two barns. Stew barns not only played a great game against Saturday night, but Stew barns scored their only goal. That's the only reason they played the one 30 tomorrow was because Stew barns got that goal. And one of what seven goals in a playoffs, not two like this jackass said. You know what I'm talking about, Hank? I think he ought to stick to the static calling and show. Yeah, it was pathetic. 560, 560, 550. See, this is your misinformation station. Thank God we don't care. Because all you do is we got a telephone, you know, and people call up into the Beth Beth. I thought you know, talk is cheap and they're here to prove it. Talk and all the crap that they have gotten a lie to you and for this last guy. Yeah, we're getting linty rough back. Not. And we're getting Marty Strockaback. Not. 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Nobody cares about the, you know, athletes in the Stokehull, and they're getting their grades from a Beth to a B. Nobody cares about that. Certainly nobody cares about the fact that the governor is wife. The governor who is elected based on being so much better than all of us being a Holy God fearing. Goody two shoes. No good rotten. Whatever it is, fascist piece of third. And his wife decides that he's above the law. And at not only she above the law, but when she gets caught with her guy, they Imperfumed. She's going to lie about it and compound the crime. And still binds a pain 41. A box of walks away. Scott free. How do you like that? I just can't stand that. Scott. Here's Carl Springs. Hello. Hello, New. Yes sir. I want to just give a shout out to that predominant Catholic guy. The prominent Catholic, you know. He's listening and he's watching. I bet he got a great weekend. Had a hand down some ghost shirt. Maybe you can go to pregnant. Maybe you had a guy. I'll hand down some guys pants. Who the hell are those? That's that. Maybe he had his hand on father's old tool. More power to him, you know. And for the dope smoking. Can't live with it. Can't live without it. But it's in the air. Something's too. Can't do anything about it. Okay. I'll see you Mexico. This guy. He's a see it on over at the E.A. guy. Right at the border. Okay. I'll see you south of the border. 5. 6. 7. 5. 6. 5. 6. 5. I'm going to tell you something. This is the goddamn truth. The people are even forgetting about the religious notes. I haven't scream about that for a hundred years. And I'll never stop. But even beyond that. I'll tell you something. Well, those people are crazier than a religious fanatics. They're the craziest of them all. And unfortunately, this country is dominated by that. That's that's why we need you know who we need. We need Jesse the body. Jesse the body. We can't afford to wait another four years. Forget about Al Gore. Forget about George Bush. The last thing we need is more bush. We need Jesse the body in there. Right now. We don't need wooden Al Gore. We've got a personality like a guy. Damn dead man. Like a cigarster Indian. And we certainly don't need any more bush. That's right. We need Jesse the body for president right now. Who would have started National Graph Campaign. Here's the guy. The criminalized marijuana. Stop it all. A bullcraft. Keep religion out of the guy. The end government. Here's the guy knows what side is bread is butterned on. Got a guy to have a brain. And admits that he's a screw to on more than a bubble and girl. And all of them put together in his happy about it. That's what we need here. That's the problem. Is all your guy to have politicians or in snatch. All brother. By the way, the rumor is, you know, half said that he might run wouldn't that be a great ticket. He could be George Bush's vice president as a candidate. Then we could have Bush and snatch. How do you like that? Yeah. Orange and snatch runs with George W. Bush Jr. Bush and snatch, baby. Go over a bigger than that guy than Brittany Spears. I'll tell you that right now. Or maybe just stick her like in the middle. Here's the girl's brain. Hello. Yes sir. You know, the government is wife lies. Okay. Then I guess the governor lies and that means the good George W. Walk a walk of Bush lies. Yeah. I mean, does it mean that the new Bush didn't lie about that bank deal, you know? Yeah. The worst thing they did on Potter was I drove the speed limit on 95 once. That was about it. The worst thing. You know, there was a kid. The genius kid last night on TV. Oh, you were the one driving the speed limit. That's the only one pot. It was a genius kid on TV last night. I don't know if you saw it. He's like 12 years old. He's finished with college. I'll hold that. No. And he's going to go through 24 years of more schooling. There were national officers. Oh, yeah. But if he watches a movie and already did movie that has three. He goes straight down on a probably go on and starts shooting up his class and Rob and got him 7-11. No, he said it watches a movie that has three curse words in it. He says that he leaves the room and shuts the movie and won't watch it. And they asked them why and he said because that's a blessed event. To leave. So he no matter how smart he is. The one thing they say somehow got in his brain. Very sad. Yeah. So you're late. Thanks to the bad news. I thought there was a good story coming there. Another one of those brainwashed little punks. Oh, it's a blessed event. No calls about that. It's through at 2020 or Bob was said 20, 20 last night. This crazy young guy. And of course those are the people that are reproducing. That's right. It wasn't bad enough they were starving the first kid to death. But then they were out there hiding from the guy named cops and she gave birth in the car to their second young kid. What a story that was. Because the Lord says you can't eat meat and you can't do the. And then he tells them when they were running from the cops, he shot a couple of squirrels. And Lynn Shierer who was doing the interview. She says, well, did you eat them and feed them to your kid? Oh, yeah. Well, you know, well, you got to do what you got to do. You got to survive. So even though they're the excuse was that they had to keep their kid pure and holy by not feeding him any meat or meat products, which is why the kid weighed about four ounces. When it was convenient and they were running from the police and breaking the law, then it was okay to feed them a little squirrel. Scorley was the operative word for that couple. I'll tell you right now, and him especially sitting there 24 hours a day right now is scriptural crap. I mean, this is a guy. He should he should follow report. Stolen brain. Do you know how many millions of people in this country should be filing a guy and criminal report for having their brain stolen? We got to have a guy named search party going on right now to see if we can find a brain that have been stolen from millions of people in this society, including that little kid that this guy was just talking about. And keep in mind, there's all kinds of intelligence, you know, there's book learning, there's an In fact, just go watch Rain Man if you don't believe that. But he's a very good driver. Even though he does go to Cincinnati by his guy there, I'm underware, nevertheless he's a very good driver. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Yeah, sir. Full play today. Hey, don't. Great. I did watch the guy. I got a full play in lunch, you didn't even hear yet. Go ahead. Thanks, too. If the first thing out of his mouth, lots of yesterday, I think one of the tournaments. They didn't say I've got things, did he? I want to thank the Lord. Oh, no, God damn it. Because without him, I wouldn't have been here. Yeah, God was betting on golf. Is that actually how desperate it is? God's betting on golf tournaments now. What's that all about? I bet the Lord was watching the column line. Yeah, exactly. Hmm. She didn't know that. Like I said, that's why the kids got shot there because they were praying to God, including that one girl that they made into a mortar now. They were praying, but he's busy betting on golf tournaments. You know, the pot thing. I hope that the EPA agent glistened. I'm a married guy, two kids, 35 years old. And I smoke weed. Yeah. It's so big deal. It's no gateway because I've never done coke and never done crack. And I have no desire. Oh, yeah, but you just wait man, one more hit. That's going to put you right over to you. That's what this guy's saying. It's a gateway drug. I'm just, I can't stand those people who use these cliches. Everything is a gateway to something worse. You know, it's the company line. And I do it. I don't do it around my kids. You know, it relaxes me. It's good before bogging. Yeah, I'm on. Yeah, I don't go around. You know, something I'm going to tell you of John Henry wants to fill up that ball that ball part to rest of the season. They couldn't. They came when a fixed game in the Marlins. They lost six in a row again. They're 21 games under 500. They're not going to be drawn flies in the June July and August. He wants to fill up that place free weed for everybody. Okay. I'm there. I'll see you at the ballpark. All right. I'm telling you, they got to rest of the week. They're on the road. And he ought to be thinking about this very seriously. Oh, but it's a family thing. Okay. Well, just a little, a little numbers for the kids. Okay. Just real small ones. Yeah, I know. Don't start. I would love to talk. Okay. They'll be raiding this building before going to clock. If they knew that our guide damn program directors both of my all three of my think Bob McCay. That's what made us here. Oh, fall out. Too much bad weed. Oh, yeah. You know those country shot kickers, baby. Oh, they're puffin' on it. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I'm on. All the time. They don't, they forget to wipe the off it. But they don't care. In fact, in some cases, could only improve that aroma. Don't like the smell of weed. I hate to break the news. Yeah, I mean, I don't mind if you want to smoke that. Don't like the smell. Mm-hmm. In fact, when you walk in a street to Amsterdam, you know, like down there, you're a rude of gasoline, some of those streets. And you're really not sure is it the weed from the, uh, have phased that's come out here or is it the, all the dog crap in the streets. It kind of, uh, a combination of those aromas, you know. Plus maybe a couple of guys who took a leak in the street. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He's been through the sea hole watching Mom and Dad.

Now I've done the comedy this is done comedy. What's your next question? What's your next question? I'm going to happen pal. I'm going to be sitting in it's not going to happen That's the American way. They just barely got it through the marijuana for medical purposes in Arizona And a couple of other places they barely squeaked that thing through But the idea that marijuana is going to be decriminalized for the general population. You must be dreaming Well, if enough people are going to declare a mom and apple pie illegal before they're going to do then Yeah, well, that's right.
