Guess what. Well, now you can. with the Mr. Haking Message Service. Hello. Howdy, home! I'm here that you're having a little wait. Problem. You need that right. You've got more chance than a Chinese home dog. What the fuck are you talking about? With the Mr. Haking Message Service, you can get it all off your chest. And she'll never even know it to you. My gosh, you're having some snacks. I can smell it all the way over here. You're a little like a girl. Tell me you piece of shit. If her ass is getting big, let or no. Call 1-800-Haking-What? All right. Okay, 10-0-2560 WQM. I got most of my throat back. I think after taking off Friday. I think that episode we had around Thursday with. Roll! I kind of went over the ages for us being out sick on Friday. Anyway, if that didn't make me sick enough, I've wasted here this letter that I got. This is how I start my week here at Greg Reed's Playground. Yeah, we're not no longer calling as QAM, by the way it's Greg and his playmates. That's what this place is all about. So I get this letter this morning. That starts out. I mean, it is glowing and glowing and beautiful. I don't want to embarrass you, Sherry and Boca, okay? I don't want to embarrass you too much. By reading this letter on a year, that's fucking bitch. Yeah. In fact, this is right on the heels. Was this Saturday? Saturday, yesterday. The arts and leisure I guess, the must have been the Saturday and the Sun Sentinel. To the arts and letter section, which I didn't even know that they got letters to the editor of that. But anyway, so there's three letters in a row from Northburg and New Jersey. One from Boca and one from a lady in Denton, Texas, all raving about Luis Miguel. I'm thinking, hey, this is pretty interesting. How did I actually fall on this? All around the country, all over the world, people are suddenly discovering there's one guy with a greatest force in a world, which I haven't told you for 15 years now, and that's the Luis Miguel. So now I get this letter. You better hold on. You better fasten your seat belts for this, okay? Okay? Okay. It's addressed to Neil God Rogers, dear Neil. I'm a female. I'm an avid fan of yours. I'm 43 in a pharmaceutical representative, three major pharmaceutical company. How do you like that? Yeah. As a result, maybe too much drugs. Maybe that's your problem, sweetheart. Sherry. As a result, I spend a lot of time in my car, and listen to a lot of radio. I sure hope you're listening to that sweet art. I started listening to you back in the days of the bird, and although I'm not a sports fan, you're so witty and clever that I even enjoy listening to you talk about sports. I go crazy over that ironic giggle, meaning I guess. Yeah. I know, however, or maybe it was, that's it. That we stole from our concerns. I know, however, felt this compelling me to write you to let you know how much I agree with your musical taste. How do you like that? Yes, I do have a 13 year old daughter who needs to learn love with in this order. Number one, back street boys. Number 298 degrees. But I re-elect them as well. We go to every concert in the photos of not just screaming girls, not my daughter or niece, of course. Would stop screaming. I might be even able to hear them. I mean, we're not going to have to. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I love the back street boys. The object of my two musical desires lies with Luis Miguel. When I hear his voice, I melt. I started listening to him seven years ago when I decided I wanted to learn Spanish. I'm a Jewish female. All. Now we get to it. All the way. Only claim the culture not to religion. I teach my children to be good people. Not good Jews. I'm becoming more and more in atheist each day. You feel the suction from this letter. I have to. I'm holding both sides of the chair. Just so not to get sucked out of the seat. That's how much suction there is in this letter so far. None of my peers know who he is, meaning Luis Miguel. He's the most talented singer I've ever heard. And we'll put Ricky Martin to shame if he would ever cross over to English. I feel a special connection to you because of Luis Miguel. Not to mention I have a week list for Latin men. Even I'm assuming sucking up the George a little bit with that part of it. Now comes the best part. Okay. Have you followed this so far? Yeah. This great glowing blowing letter. On the 14th. Meaning of course this past Saturday. I'm going to a very out of the way. Ticket master location to get tickets for the basketball is concert. So I have a better chance of getting good seats. Now here comes the good part. Strap yourselves in. Hold on tight. We were thrown into a melting pot. Neil if there's any way of getting good seats for the concert myself. My daughter and niece I would donate time and money to the Humane Society. We are very active in this cause as I perform. I retired Greyhounds to many people I have to interact with. You would also be making two young girls grateful to you forever. Do I hear about young girls? No. No. I don't even care. I don't care about young anybody. I hate kids. Okay sweetheart. That's true. What are you laughing about? I don't like little kids. Girls of any age. And boys out of the age of what's legal here on the age of 18. We are very active in this causes I perform. I retire. They are really great kids involved empathetic with one great love. The back street boys. In the capital letters of course. If you could help me. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. If you could help me. No. I would also be forever grateful and would give back in whatever way I could. I also never stole a freight train. With affection. Sherry. I'll spare her the embarrassment. I won't read the last name on a year. Even though it's written here which I'd be too embarrassed. But I guess we couldn't have gotten her those tickets without the last name. Sherry who lives in Boka who leaves her phone number. Her voice mail number. Her shoe size. Her breath size. Her. Her. Beckham size. Which is growing by the second now. I understand. Is this unbelievable or what? She's this. Christ. How many times over the years have you heard me say we almost never hear from women? But all I got into is hand like today was to talk about the day I joked about them with the dolphin tickets. And that guy in the car calls and puts his freaking wife on a phone. And she's sucking and sucking. Sound like the voice of experience to me. Sucking heavy duty. And then all of a sudden, when you know we are big dolphin fans. Yeah. Girl, go buy some goddamn tickets. Okay. What I saw of the take from that exhibitionist game. There were plenty of empty seats in that joint boy. You could have gone bowling at P.P. Park. To see that debacle. This right here, this letter in my hand right now. This epitomizes by 23 years in this town. In fact, no, it epitomizes the town. Not just my years. It epitomizes this whole town. What can you give us for free? And even though she's only 43, she'll be a great singer set as it's from their own. Sheery. A yintha in training. Another old fart ready to go. Hop, whatever you got for free. She's ready to take the sweet and low. She's ready to take the silverware. She wants to guide them tickets for her two young girls. She's going to get it. Oh, no. I'm going to get it all right. No, no tickets. The worst letter in the history of broadcasting. There was right there. After two paragraphs of sucking and using my lines in my material. Sucking and sucking and sucking already. Jesus Christ Almighty. There ought to be a law. Exactly. Whatever the hell that means. What does that mean? And I'll further start. Exactly. God. I'd rather have roll. I'm back in the studio. I'd rather blow his brains off and have that happen again. Then read a letter like that to start my week. Nice going, Sheery. Come in here with a scratchy throat getting my health back a little bit after a nasty cold. And I got to read another. I want it, letter. I'm going to say I have to ten to five sixty WQ and by the way, Bluffs air conditioning is car one out. I'm Saturday's net of shame is everybody. There's a fight, Greg. There's a fight. I'm sorry. I won't hurt. Out the moon, my. And a thing is going to see it's all long. And the cold last night will only one thing done. And I'll always have to let your ball lose no no. And see my good man. Come in here. I'm going to say I have to go. Where will I pass my call? And I'll take it so that we won't let die. No. No thank you. No thank you. Let me. This is my next week. I've got the collection for Sheery. So if you get some nasty boy tickets for that. Pain in the ass daughter when he's there is that way you can take up a collection for Elton. What do you say? Fine. Let's go. Anyway, Joe Costell. I wasn't here Friday. Was out sick. So we had one of those best of things. But Joe Costell and JP who did long the party. JP, damn it. I was pretty damn good. It was excellent. The only negative about that place. The food was very, very good. The only end they paid. How do you like that? Here's the story ladies and gentlemen. Joe Costell and JP picked up the tab. Who's time in my life and recent memory that anybody Schlepper is like that and picked up the tab. And JP's back in Jamesville safely now. Didn't get a chance to kiss him goodbye here on Friday. It was very distraught all Friday. I think in all of a geez. Another one gets away. The only bad thing about the macaroni grill up there at University in Broward and Plantation. I'm sure they're all over the place. I don't think they have other ones down here. The only negative is that why is it that places like this field that they, well, first of all, the one negative and he was okay. But he was Jose was the waiter. Some old spick. I mean, yeah. And then it's time in restaurant. And JP is saying, well, I'll have to play you. And I said, no, no, it's polo. Not polio. Don't start. And of course, Jose says, see, see, yeah, polio. Yeah, get out of here Jose. You were a good guy, but stop at the esponial in Italian. Join. But the real negative was they they want to put on the musical entertainment. I don't know about you. Maybe maybe I'm crazy. When I go into a good restaurant, I want to eat. I don't want violins. I don't want musical. You know, if there's a little music in a background, you know, way in a background on the speakers, that's nice. Especially in Italian restaurant, you know, like in Italy. You go in your sit down. And in the background, I know I just have nice low level of planet mouthy. That's beautiful. Okay. It's a nice accompaniment. Two wonderful new. At the night. Yeah. And that's enough. But anyway, they got the in the middle of the meal. Like about two thirds of the way through the minute. Now, they won guy. I don't know if he's the owner of what he is. But this big fat chubby guy, I guess really Italian. He goes over to a table. He's singing somebody happy birthday. I think it's birthday. I thought you, you know, it's okay. Little not quite so loud next time would be better. But it was all right. But now we're two thirds of the way through the meal. And all of a sudden, here comes this guy. I don't want to say dark, complicated guy out of the kitchen. And he stands up in the middle of the place. They dim the lights. And I'm thinking, oh my god, it's a stick up. What's going on here now? And this guy, I thought for sure he was going to sing. Oh man. River. I don't want to sound like a racial thing. But what was that? And he starts singing a song. And I have no idea what the song was. No, no, that's not what it was. I mean, I couldn't figure out what language he was singing in or what the song was. And everybody's kind of like looking at each other. And then all of a sudden he finally finishes. And I do mean finally it went on for an eternity. And all of a sudden he finishes. And now there's this tremendous observation. And we realize most of it is coming from inside the kitchen because he works in the kitchen. They got the kitchen help. The shepherds from the kitchen coming out and singing in the middle of your meal. And I'm in one of those good meal. A great experience that I'm asking myself. Why are you doing that? Why are you trying to spoil an very enjoyable evening that somebody else is paying for no less? If I haven't somebody come out here and sing in some bizarre language that I have no idea. Am I right? Ask your hotel. We have no idea what language he was singing in it. What the song was. In fact, you know, something old man River would have been an improvement. That old man River, that would have been great. You know, I don't know what the hell it was. And everybody's a plot. I think they were plotting because it was over with Nick and go back to their meal. I'll get out of here. Go back to the kitchen and wash some dishes. Well, yeah. And please, whatever you do don't touch our food. God. That was bizarre. So you people over there to macaroni grill. And I'm sure you're doing a good business. But it probably be enhanced a little bit. If you just cut the crap of the entertainment, we don't want entertainment when we're eating. If you want a you know people want to see a show and a dinner, that's fine. But you go into place that's supposed to be a restaurant. All we want is the food. Good service. Good food. Good buy. That's it. Hello and goodbye. Here's a pleasant facts, by the way. From Ian in London. In Shirley. It says in the early 90s, I lived the wild and four-laternal. These listed you on WI. The occasionally. In fact, it was about the only thing I missed when I left Florida came back to the UK. Now I have a life basis. How do you like that? Even the UK is better than here. That's saying a lot. And he tells me about, uh, man, it's just to make a long story. Shorty is listening over there in London on the internet. I call an air paly. We'd probably be able to talk to you. But of course, being the cheap bastards that they are around here. We don't have it 800 lines. We don't even have a free line for the bastard's over and for a Myers. Those Porsche lovers who are desperate to have some contact. Some communication with the outside real world. Which this is the closest they get. And I'd say in much. Now one of the most depressing things I've ever seen. Say I don't want to stare at that until we kind of on a download. Do I? Okay. Well, after the letter from Shirley, it's only got a good better. You know, VH1 is showing these. What do they call it? Where are they now? We could do a radio thing like that. Can you imagine? Greg, Budell, Gregory, Benjamin, Budell. Where is he now? And then it calls. Oh, I need a high five. Greg, if they are still in country kitchen waiting on cables. It was a sad thing. Oh, where are they now? And this particular one. And of course, none of them are ever good. They're either dead and they died tragically. They went through a horrendous drug problem. Every single one of these where are they now? Is depressing. And you're thinking to yourself at least I'm thinking. Why couldn't you just leave me with the memories? Okay. What they used to look like. What they used to sound like. I'd add a meeting one and a no where they are now. But once I got into this, I couldn't turn it off. And what was the group? Couldn't think the way out of a paper bag. And you're both out, sorry for. Yeah, and he's out. I was through in the thing where you think what's inside. I will say this. Jan Barry did look good. Okay. Couldn't sing a with a crap. But he looks good. If you could see, this is the proof. If anybody in any of my religious nuts out there in the audience, if you want proof that there is no God, you must see that's piece on VH one about Jan and Dean. If you could see, what Jan Barry looks like now. Now granted, he had that horrible car wreck. People had drive Corvette, shouldn't he drive it irresponsibly, Jan? You know what I'm saying? Okay. I'll move up on my ride. You go down to the floor of the city. Jack. I have never in my life. I can't describe to you. You know, Igor, our good friend Igor and productioner. Igor looks like I would say like Johnny Dep. Compared to what Jan Barry looks like now. Igor looks like Brad Pitt by comparison. That's how I grow up to Jan Barry. I would say he's about 58.59 would be my guess. Because they were say he was 25 and I'm adding the years to try to figure out how old he is. He could pass for 80 easy. And he's like fat and all like, he can narrowly talk. Because he ended horrible car wreck and they thought he was going to die. Well, I knew that he was in a car wreck. And at that point, I kind of forgot about Jan and Dean as far as, you know, following what happened to them. Because they couldn't seem the right of a paper sack to begin with. It was fun music. It was okay. But I'm looking on Jan and Dean. They're surf city album. And they show you how much great music they had of their own. Listen to some of the cuts on this album. This is Jan and Dean's music. Oh, what did you put me down? I put out to it. Yeah. Okay. Not, not. Was that Jan and Dean's music? No. Could that have been something else that they ripped off from their bodies, the beach boys? Oh. Could that have been another one they ripped off from them? Well, they didn't have enough of their own hits to fill up an album for Christ's eggs. They're a man, Peter. Oh, no. Could that be another beach boys? Yeah. Oh, I dare to hear. Well, they couldn't possibly be any more beach boys cut on this album. Could they're like, that would get, oh no. No. Come on. It's just y'all. Isn't it? Please. Please, don't be a chist. No. Okay. That's enough. Jan and Dean. I bet you there's nobody else in this audience who saw that piece on VH1. And if you're old enough like Jan and Dean and what they looked like. Okay. Forget about the fact that they couldn't sing for crap. And of course, naturally they have to make a big song to dance on these segments. Oh, yeah. They're not even in our rock and roll hall of fame. And it's a disgrace and y'all y'all y'all. I mean, what are they talking about? One of these people talking about just because Jan had a bad car wreck. And they've made 75 comeback. And Jan, they're, they're carrying him around like I like a doll. You know, like a big, blown up doll. Very sad. VH1, please start doing that to us. Okay. Please start doing that to us. I wouldn't be surprised if the next one is going to be Jackie Wilson. We know where he is now in the ground. And as a matter of fact, the, the, the, the, the very one next one after that was Rick Nelson. I, if I seen him lightly. Oh, no, I didn't watch that. I've had a, the thing with Jan and Dean had had, it brought peers to my eyes. That's how they pressing a lot. So if you want to make a big mistake, ask where are they now? And somebody will tell you, so oh, Jesus, I'm so sorry. I asked. It's just like I'm so sorry. I opened up that letter from Sherry this morning to start my week. Sherry and Boca. I should use the last name. You know what? Bitch. Here's a call from West Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. I'm going to Italy for a sign tomorrow. Yes. I think it's Sheridan and then it's in Florence for a couple of weeks. Never been in Venice. No. No. And Rome and a continental. Right. And he must be over there. Yeah, the Pope. Everything. Uh-huh. One of the questions. What do you fly, Elitite? Elpa. Delta. Delta? Delta? Your fly and a Delta? You're going to Italy and your land and Delta airline? Yeah. I'm stuck. When's that in my girlfriend's Richard? My girlfriend wanted it now. It's the same person I think. No. No. No. I don't hear talking about on guiding light. I know exactly what you're talking about. It did it from people. But I know that. I know that, sir. I've been watching guiding lights since before Jesus was a baby. Right. That story line's got to go, man. It's got to go. I see the answer is Billy. Right. Okay. We're going to come along. It's from Buffalo Bill. Have a great time. Thanks. See you. Say hi to Will Papa. Lot Papa. 5605050. Anybody want any free dolphin tickets? Come on. Let's see. We can get some women out here early today. Early in the week for some free dolphin tickets. We got any? No. But all I got to do is mention that. And I'll guarantee you some bits of beyond there before you can say douchebag. Oh, no. You really, really, my pants and tickets. How about some back street boys tickets for your kids? Yeah. Thank God. Much music is doing this all back street boys. It fits right in. Again, 24 hours of it. See, I hate to break the news to you, Sherry. Whatever your name is in Boca. I'll be real glad of my good close friend Tracy Nile. Come to me with my back street boys tickets. Right there in the front row. Since I'm the number one adult back street boys fan in the world. Beyond a shadow of a doubt. And she loves the Weasemagirl. And anything you like Nile, I like it too. Oh, God. What a suckling you are, Sherry. I'm embarrassed for you. I'm embarrassed for all of us that you're out there. I'm the loose. God. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, rock, get through. Little loads, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly. Oh, lady from Highly.

You're going to agitate a partial only keeps a turnover for a reader Now I can't think of no one who would take me meaner than a little lady from I only just to call that you stalk you the real old parts, see the dirt of having their bees follow Or see the little old lady from the I only die So what do you think about that Jan Buriga? So what do you think about that Jan Buriga? I think about that Jan Buriga. This is the only place in the universe where you could just make the comments I did before I said it was very sad to see what they look like now Especially Jan who looks 120 years old easy and is all blown up like a bull frog and it's tragic I said it was you know you can't think for sure Which is true and I get a fact that says Jan and Dean had plenty of hits geek geek And it goes on to listen surf city drag city which are both on the CD by the way little lady from Pasadena Why the wild surf which is also on here baby talk baby talk So what did they hit? Bad man's curve which I just got through playing about the 10 seconds that I did not Yeah and of course the John penis is favorite which is something he tried to do in the Key's last week and it didn't work out too good sidewalk surfing And some guys are there. They were great because the unnamed king who facked his middle son of a big fact Yeah they were great. I said the music was fun. I liked Jan and Dean probably only because Jan looked so good But nevertheless I like him. What's not to like they were okay? It was partly on the answer that whole era of marginal music what was wrong with that But I'd have to bet somebody's got to get hostile as opposed to saying you know oh yeah I saw that thing and you write that was that was enough to bring you to tears That was enough to make you want to scream Anybody who could believe there's a god to look at the before and after a Jan barriers is thinking of themselves Oh my goodness Speaking of god by the way So was repeat the thing on 60 minutes last night about the Magdalene long reason Ireland Those poor cat looks maybe they're getting it left side right side upside down And then at the end of the show they showed the irrelevant moon scandals thing too On 60 minutes last night also repeat Yeah repeat but nevertheless religion took a real beating last night on 60 minutes Oh here at yeah What a what a disgrace Typical sexist crap from the church I mean these were not only women who had had sex but they were thinking about it They were like on the verge maybe they were going to have some kind of a sexual encounter Let's send them away to these long memories for like about a hundred years and make them disappear And then they found all these bodies that they dug up these sides to make it even more appetizing Nice going papa The crazy people that's the religious people are the crazy people how many years have I been telling you that Speaking of crazy people my good boyfriend Tom Jika who still hasn't discovered another book just Came on forget about that or the SEC fine See everybody's talking about all the hate sites on the internet The 2000 websites and about this one's first amendment rights our first amendment rights just as far as having a sense of humor We've got the word police after us and nobody in this town in the media print or otherwise as discovered at SEC business Including the brilliant Tom Jika who's who busy punching at the track with a capelin To find out what's really going on in a local media big big story he didn't figure with us But in yesterday's Q and A in the Sun sent a TV book Here's a question probably another one at the time made up What happened the Panthers radio announcer Chris Moore does he have another job or is he going back to New Jersey we can only hope Ask JW and Fort Lauderdale ask it about Chris Moore on answer way to hear this answer from Tom Jika Little bit of truth isn't too dangerous Tom more had been living a double life throughout his tenure with the Panthers His wife is a successful lawyer in New Jersey who couldn't relocate So she and the kids stayed up north and more commuted he got tired of traveling in time away from his family So we gave up the Panthers he's hoping to find work in the New York area or with the SPN or he's sometimes fills in while working for the Panthers more as an excellent talk host Personal informed in a master of many voices and excellent talk host But he's an awful play by playman In fact, it's a stretch to describe as call of the game is play by play he would go off on stream of consciousness riffs hardly ever describe what was happening on the guys's plays Developed then scream like a band he went to Google with scoring No, I like that Yeah, so half right there Tom he's an excellent talk show host Christina Moore sit down comedian They were great damn it They were my favorite they're the best damn group since the beach boys. I think that right now at a basketball boy. I'm yeah, that's right Anybody believe that no except this asshole at semi this hate facts because they had all of these great hits Oh, yeah, they had so many big hits. They couldn't fill up one CD with their greatest hits. That's how many well, of course their career was cut short by that tragic accident Cause Jan was driving a Corvette to God then fast. He thought he had a Mustang 22 before 11 at five 60 W to QA and in fact if he wouldn't have had a Mustang he probably would be in better shape today because he couldn't have gone at fast Correct, I F It's not his to do what's that doing the hook it's okay I'm doing the hook it's okay Guys, this is that guy's just that the fact that is a good point. I think it ought to have just This show how much just somebody we have for Jan Berry the what bad shape even. Let's do all Jan and Dean today. What are you saying? All right That was okay. That was it was it had its moment I'm a scale of 10 I give it about a section half Anyway, I'll tell you who I give a minus 6000 that's that jackass Michael Mayo with a son's And I'm so sick and tired of the suckles on this radio station. I don't want to mention no name Reading my mail. Yeah, hey, come on give me a break give me a break The great sports writers we got in this town. What is going on here lately with this insetsuance relationship, you know Drives him as a matter of fact even mentions even Henry stadiums up to fuse right on the money He starts out by talking about oh, yeah, we don't want to get sucked in this tax for another stadium and Bop, Bop, Bop, and then he goes on to tell which side he is the best one just like everybody else Oh, we don't want to spend any tax money, but if we have to build it how about right there in Miramar Which is centrally located in the highway friendly. He says and I like Hank Goldberg's line. He says any site with inside a corner is a good site I hate to break the news to your Michael Mayo most of us don't go to call her. How do you like that? I say the overwhelming majority of people in this town don't go to call her George is the George go to call her No, do I go there I've had many in years. No Joe Constellos you go to call her no And then he goes on again to say and not that I support any of public financing, but and see This is a column another one of these columns with all these little random thoughts He just says junk food for thought now this would have been a perfect column To put in the apology to Dave Halberstein that's some of us have been waiting for what you're gonna have for that apology Did he put it in there no Even put you in a thing here new panters boys jigs McDonald's a nice blast for the past rule islander fans use it live so Mike mail But I feel bad for Steve Goldstein what does it take for a deserving up and come or to get his shot So in other words, he's got Hank in here.

If we hadn't found a solution, we wouldn't have found another solution, I'll have to read the console and also read the console. We were looking most closely at the top. But, still regarding life. If we have a bear gift picture. Piece of … Unfusional I would be shocked if i was on the수ário Square. Yes. Don't forget to go check out the ad on our social board.

P. being in there with his pretty face did a good job nice cause we'd aren't even always up there in gamesville but on the other hand I don't feel quite so pressured about having food in here you know because I told him don't ever give an order like that again not seriously you feel pressured certain people hang it around and they figure you know they're not getting paid the leasing to his feet and give him a free lunch to something in their mouth you don't talk about how about you do so maybe we'll have a little lunch today and maybe not because I way about six hundred pounds yes no we don't want to eat we got his beef jerky that's good you're right good point George is on his best behavior now he just came back from vacation probably ate like a pig yeah and you know something I don't I usually don't eat bread because at first of all I can't eat bread I'm diabetic and since my blood sugar way up and number two I'm fat so I should be no breath and number three I don't like bread that much anyway but macaroni grill the best part of the meal the bread if you ever eat it or you've never been there no it's great they bring out these fresh fake round slopes of bread warm and they got like all kinds of herbs in the bread you know and then they bring and they put a little plate and they put some fresh extra virgin olive oil on the plate for you to dip in like you wouldn't italy I think I ate myself two loaves of that bread I mean they're small but nevertheless and the top at all after my pasta which I had no business eating had dessert a big piece of amaretto cake dip with with what the kind of sauce was it on the bottom of the plate you know oh God it was good caramel sauce amaretto cake and caramel sauce it was great I'm serious it was very good and Joe and the JP picked up the tad don't be just like so on guys I'm not used to that I can get used to that in the hurry after eating with some of those other people and I want to mention no names what all was females for they stopped yeah well best I could afford you know 560560 pound 560 and see now he's going to be called oh you didn't want to go up to there that's right I had a special dinner with the guys okay and they were buying that was a very good place except for that music here's some rise hello Neil yes sir how are you doing that one the asshole that called which one was at the self proclaimed asshole yeah those calling you an A-haul you're making big bucks I think he's got his English down or something because the adjective needs to use his truthful because you get more truthful every day and that's why people a lot of truthful and honest asshole yeah well if you if that's what you know I mean I'm just saying I people are afraid of the truth yeah and that's why a lot of people they like targeting and stuff now he was just having a little fun he likes to just yeah he was squeezing himself when it was standing oh I hear it hey I'm what do you say what happened remember about I'm so I'm listening to the show um why don't you were gone and everything and by the way are you feeling better I hope so yeah I'm feeling great I can't talk that go but I'm okay oh that's right I'm listening to the the quote unquote show you know the tape showing everything and um sir you were right on the money about the legalization of weed the reason why it's not legal and all that um that it's a witch hunt right and in my opinion the reason why is now I'm saying that drugs should be legal or whatever okay I'll just talk about the green because I don't do anything else but the reason why it's not I'm there you go the reason why it's not legal because these this country is wrong by redness and phony's and they need to hit like like George W. Bush and by the way isn't interesting how they made a big strong to dance about Clinton once maybe you tried weed and he claims he didn't inhale because he had to say that or they would have nailed him to across and here we got a guy who won't even deny that it's their did cocaine he had a blues problem and now they're gonna probably bring us out of the power problem that's when he get the real problem of the white powder not little goddamn weed right and I'd like to have a co-cat is the president no sir and I think I think that these politicians that they need some might have to point the finger at plus that's it was everything was legal then there won't be any anybody getting chaos yeah but just imagine how much tax money we could raise from it that we could build a steady on every

you know marijuana property yeah this Friday which Friday which Friday 13 I have to say was probably the most memorable Friday 13 it's ever because me and without check yeah me and about three of my friends you know all good guys you know Neil fans and stuff all of us got arrested for a position of marijuana really um i was the one to make a touch because i had a little road you know my friend he had about a niche of an ounce and he had like some paraphernaly he had a pipe and stuff you know like it just hit me when we got arrested that see a lot of probation i'm not going to say with a more probation for a courier so i mean getting caught with this road really isn't going to be helpful to me you know and that's what the court and they're going to let me have it but it's difficult to me even if you're found innocent for example like a road i don't know if you know Florida like a zero tolerance they do not if it is it doesn't matter how much i caught with because either way you're going to pay for it yeah i think it's a cheer for like even just a road exactly but what is all about it's money because court caught at least 250 dollars and court comfort loan you want to be paid the case you have a pay for a lawyer or they're saying to read hard run advocate program but going to cost you money too with our dollars and make laws and bounds and sense that our money you know saying they're just putting all these people who probably can't afford any money how many times have i told you sir that you live in a police state how many years have i been talking about? i've said police state the idea that marijuana the desert is just arbitrarily as an illegal weed and that possession of it or even growing a couple of plants can send you as to jail is so outrageous that if this was any kind of a country of people with a brain they'd be riding in the streets they'd be overthrowing this fricking fashes government that we got yeah well i mean the people who smugged marijuana like i'm the fun of daily basis right when you get caught for a court for a position exactly or even doors can go for this if you get caught for smugging marijuana the person goes through mine is i can't believe about to get you know right exactly and you know now what it makes me do no i don't even feel like bleeding my head but you're just hiding somewhere maybe the country would be good i can't be in a street if anyone's too paranoid right anyway if they are rubbish or a breath good luck pal let's go bail out guy out what do you say marijuana police you people in law enforcement

That's the first lady has disappeared. We next we asked. What? Here. Technically bar that red dress. No. It's 2015 at 5.60 WCUAM. I'm going to read these articles these are letters to it. They're by Luis Miguel and play two hours of Luis Miguel. Unless we really get these phones, sizzling and smoking here. Let's get some Janet Dean talk, not that guy that sends me a cost-expect. Yeah, geek, you don't know Janet Dean and all these men. And then this guy's given me an equivalent of a straight face. They were big influence on a Beatles. Yeah. And Eros Smith too make no mistake about that. Here's a mobile and top and a hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I want to see that movie, the Blair Wisk project. Have you seen it yet? No, I sure have not. You're not under no circumstances. If I want to see Vertigo, I'll go see the Alfred Hitchcock version. I'm telling you, my head was pound and I'm off. Yes, I read it. I read a truth thing. They said that a lot of the theater owners are getting wheeled up set because people were puking their guts out in the theaters because they were getting dizzy. They were getting vertigo from all the acute chemo. Definitely. It's like the worst home movie ever seen. They're here in the real scary part. The witnesses carry part. Yeah. Look, there's a pile of rocks in front of our tent. Oh, is next scary part. Yeah. The second scary part. And then that's where the whole family went. Wait a minute. That's the show that you've made $80 million. How stupid the public is. All you got to do is say, oh, this is different and unique and really something. And all of a sudden, all these morons go rushing out to see it. Neil, it was so pitiful and so bad. Yeah. We used to see something a home movie and they're filling in their loose with the camera. It's busy. And all of a sudden they put it out of the ground and don't turn it off. That's the best. You've got to come on. Half the movie is the cameras on the ground and they're talking. And there's nothing scary. There's no bookie man. There's no dialogue. It's absolutely retarded. I hear that. I hear that. I hear the home movie. I think it was a heavy day. That's okay. Let's have a great day. Guys, a little bit too wired for me there. You know, I'm saying just a little bit too talkative for me. I understand that even the camera guy that carries the camcorder on the top green show. Even he don't wobble. It is much in the camera either. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line. The Blair Witch Project. And we had people calling in here a couple of weeks ago trying to defend and say it was a good flick and go and see it. I've talked to 65,000 people between then and now. And I've read 62,000 articles about it. And every single one of them said, save your money. Okay. People are starving. Don't waste your money on that piece of hype crap. The Blair Witch Project. But you gotta understand. This is, and then they're all right. These articles all the suit of intellectuals. Oh, the Hollywood studio's are tearing your hair off because it made all this money. And it was a little budget film. It wasn't a film. It was a goddamn joke. A bunch of kids with a goddamn camera kicking out in the goddamn wood somewhere. Oh, let's make them movie. Here you go. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, by the way, a Blair Witch sock. Right, that's what I hear. But what I want to ask you is your opinion on this, the 10, 20 life law. Yeah. I was watching the news and they were talking about a guy in Fort Lauderdale. We've got a pulled over, arrested. They found some cocaine in the car. And they determined that he had intent to distribute. Yeah. And also they found a gun. And now that becomes a 10 year mandatory seven. Good. You agree with that? Yes, I do. That could be just as well. If you would have got pulled over with marijuana within a 10 to 10 degree. That I don't agree. You know, of course not. But that's the way to law structure. Yeah. If you would have got pulled over and it would have happened. I've been marijuana and a gun. Right. It's a 10 year man mandatory sense. Sir, let me say it again. There shouldn't be any penalty for possession of growing, distributing, selling, doing anything with marijuana. It's a plant that grows in the ground. No, I understand. I agree one hundred percent. But the way that the way that that 10, 20 life law is, yeah, if you get caught doing anything, very, and you happen to have a gun. Not that you used to go. But you asked me my opinion to go with the cocaine in the gun. I said, I agree with that. No. I'm any one of your opinion on the 10, 20 life demandatory about the gun. Yeah. In addition to which it's a first anyway, because most of those cases get plea bargain anyway before they finally, you know, ever come to court. So it's a, it's a mood point. But in my understanding, it's a mandatory three years sense that they used to have, you know, man, all those billboards up for years. It was a joke. Most of the cases got plea bargain. A lot of the guys that were spent more than like six months in jail. But I thought if they got arrested, that's a 10 year man of mandatory sense period. That's not how it works. Judges. Well, some of the public work. Well, I have no idea. Somebody will tell me. Yeah. I'm interested to hear what the people have to say about that. OK. Thanks a lot. And tell George W. to put the white powder away. OK. Time to take a powder. We don't mind a BC powder, especially if you're from George R. Arkansas. But we don't like that white powder, especially if you want to sit up there with you finger right in the button with your finger on it. 560 50 50 50 50 50 50 60 on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile in Jupiter. Hello. Yeah, Neil. How you doing? OK, sir. I'm going back to Jan and Dean and trying to give you worse than Jan and Dean. Yeah. How about Fabian Forte? Fabian was the worst. He was the worst. But at least at least there were people who thought he looked good all say Jan heard. He looked a lot better than he did. Right. And another one. He kind of a disgusting Philadelphia way. I guess he looked OK. Right. Dicky doing the don't. Yeah. I think they will work. And the royal team did short shorts. Pretty bad. Yeah. I guess it's all relative. I kind of liked Jan and Dean. I love Jan and Dean. Maybe 12th, November, baby car. Yeah. And 12th. Pardon? I said it was great. OK. That's it. That's like not included. But you didn't see the piece on VH1. I'd take it on. What they were fine. I've seen a bunch of others. I haven't seen that one. Oh, please. Oh, if it comes on, shut it off immediately. It'll be so depressed. You will speak for weeks. I'm telling you. They look so good on big quarks in their advanced stand back in the 60s. Yeah. They look good with Dick. Have a great day. All right. Bye. OK. See you. In fact, I think they're in that new movie deck. I think Jan verys in there. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Well, I'm telling you. Let me say it again. Anybody that believes in God. You take a look at that Jan and Dean thing. I take one look at Jan very for about two seconds. And you'll say, oh my God. Exactly. What has got rotten? Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Hello. Hey, now what's the best marijuana you ever smoked? I never smoked any. Sure, about 20 years ago. I smoked a little and gave me a bad headache. What's the best you ever smoked? Probably. I think the crit is the best. Yeah. But it costs a lot. Yeah. What did you hear about that? But I know we've got a lot of good stuff here at QAM. Power 96. They got the good crap. Oh yeah. Yeah. I don't know. But did you hear about the crash on shared and street in 441 and 4 kids died? Yes. The fourth one died in a concussion? Yes. Yeah. And where my best friend is a sad isn't it? And really you said they said they were going over 80 or 100. That's what happens when you just, uh, our smart ass. Yeah. And they said the other kids in the Mustang were drinking. Mm-hmm. So man, it's just a sad loss to commute. Like I said, stay away from the most things that I'll cause. Okay, pal, hang in there. So it's great loss to the community. See, I'm, I'm concerned now. In that particular case, you got people irresponsible on both sides. What I get real nervous about is like one car. They're drinking and the smoking or whatever they're doing in the one car and stone out of their mind into responsible. And then some poor bastard is just going through the intersection or making a turn like that thing we had in South ADS today to see that one. Happens to be in a wrong place at the wrong time. Oh, oh, dead. Or maybe Maine for life. That's what I get real upset about. 560, 50560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. Let's hear from somebody in this audience who doesn't know who Jan and Dean is and doesn't want to know that's what we're going to hear. Oh! Here's a mobile and Cooper city, hello. Hey, Neil, born in 1970. Don't care about Jan and Dean. Good. That was quick service. I can't do that. I can't go see a movie because it gave me a headache. What kind of push push did you got call on this show, Neil? Meaning what? Meaning if you can't handle seeing a goddamn movie. Stay at home, what the hell, man? I don't know about you, but when I go to a movie, I don't want to see the picture like shaking all over the place. I want to sit there and be able to watch it without getting a headache. Yeah, that's true. But I mean, that's a little bit of an exaggeration to fact that the entire movie was shaking all over the place. What percentage did the movie would you say it was? What percentage? Yeah. During most of the during the parts where they were running, which was, oh, no, they hardly ever really ran. They just kind of like, you know, we're all going to do around you. Yeah, you know. Well, is that true? How long is that movie by now and a half? Probably, yeah. And you want to see a bunch of kids in the woods walk around around for an hour and a half saying, oh, my God, there's a bunch of rocks over there. Well, I can't keep spinning around like a drill. I guess the point was that you just go to show you that you don't need to be like a mega million dollar studio to put out a interesting flick. No, it was, it was the first of all. It wasn't interesting based on everybody I've talked to. And number two, it goes to show you that hype can sell any crap that you come out with. That's what it shows. Let's do that now. See, yeah. Yeah, it's too bad that I want to agree with the appell. See, you're the one that's just going along with what everybody is saying all these experts. All the Hollywood moguls are having a number of spraked up because this movie is grossed 80 million dollars and it was made with a $50 budget. And yada yada yada yada yada. And because a lot of idiots out there because it became a cult thing, you know. And a lot of things that become a cult thing are swirl, are garbage, okay? I'll give you a perfect example. Anybody seen the Rocky Horror Picture Show lately? I mean, that was fun the first 600 times, okay? And throwing a bunch of crap at the screen. And of course, when you come up with a movie like that, you deserve that a bunch of crap throwing at the screen. That's all that movie was good for. We're throwing a bunch of rotten food if you part of the expression at the screen. And most of the people in the audience were a bunch of rotten food. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the mobile one. By the way, look what I look out for those runaway essence, okay? That's the best giveaway, okay? When somebody starts to speak with those two bad JP8, here he does a better than anybody I know. And the essence too. This play like man and they look like women. If you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you bad, if you like get whoever comes home, must be in the garlic to live on it. And if you have to get yourself a little closer, will we be not completely brain-wrosed up? And you're a dragon with a big bad invisible planet and you didn't do nothing about it. You're a blind. You're not me, yo, but man and I don't judge, you've got to find yourself a lead to a bushing or a mouthwash, rep it. And a good friend. When you start to talk and everybody left, tap and take the fan. Better take action on your own, or the best. The order right you mouth or a loon should friend. Come 30 to five, 60 to WQ. We don't have time for this show now. We're watching Global Groove on MTV and they got busy. A lot of people on there, huh, on the beach. They got busy busy people doing busy things on the beach and we're busy watching it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line. As made it's would say, here's a pepper pine, till I'll be. Yo, yes sir. Good afternoon. When is starting to? When I got this. To guide a call about the 10, 20 life is wrong. Yeah. If you caught with a gun, that'll be not the 10, 20 life it doesn't apply. If you use a gun in a crime. In a commission of a crime. Right, exactly what I've had is. So if the guy is worried about getting caught. Oh, alright. If you're caught, if that applies to the, are they capable of plea bargaining out of that or is that odd matter? Of course. Of course. Because you know, they don't have to re-torch the call. We have no much law in this state that's really automatic. They tell you, oh, yeah, it's automatic. You've done it and then they plea bargaining it away anyway. They never serve more than six months. The only thing mandatory is the drug loss. Yeah. I got a friend that's in jail for 10 years. I caught with a sheet of assets. 10 years they gave. Yeah. And he's he a mandatory. What a house. She said is. mandatory sentence 85% of that. So he's got a survey in the half of years. Also, I got sick and Blair which don't see it. Okay, later. Thanks. See, there's another guy that says, Blair Witch Project. This is cheating. Wasn't that one of Jan and Dean's big hits, I think. Wasn't that too exciting? Yeah. Oh, oh. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We took a poll here. We talked to 170, 2000 people about the Blair Bitch Project. And they all said, save your money, honey. Don't waste your time. It's crap. It's direct. Every single one of them said that except some of the young suits who think that it's cool and hip to say, oh, yeah, man. That was really great. That was scary. That was really scary. The only thing that's scary to me is that anybody were wasted or money is going to see it. That's scary. Here's my email. Hey, Nia, how you doing? Okay, sir. I bet it doesn't even seem to be a show for about three years now. Yes. And I didn't see you for two reasons. Yeah. Number one, because I agree with 95% of the things that you say, and number two, your funny as hell. Yes. And one of the things that I don't agree with you with the religion topic. Yeah. I'm a step at the event of this Christian. Oh, I know you're an atheist, right? Yes. And the only thing I really don't agree is that I don't know why you put down a bad enough people that believe in Jesus Christ. When you know, I wouldn't even mind you having you over in my home for dinner. Yeah. And you know, I would have been. When did I ever do that? I never, I never said you can't believe in whatever. I always say you believe in whatever furry tells you want. Just don't use it as a weapon against other people. That's exactly what I'm saying. That's exactly what I'm saying. I wouldn't bad. I would have been like those people in Ireland with those Madeline long reads that they had on 60 minutes last night where they sent all those hundreds of thousands of women away because they were thinking about having sex or maybe they did it all around one time. And they sent them away and they found all those bodies buried. I wouldn't judge you or condemn you to help with being an atheist. I would just try to, I respect everybody's opinion. You know, and if you're opinion is being a atheist. What do you mean you respect if you, if there's a difference between my respecting you're right to have an opinion, I'm respecting what that opinion is. Exactly. You know, I wouldn't badmoth you or send you to help with being an atheist. Yeah. You know, and you know, you can't send me to hell. I'm already there. No, you don't have to say that. I'm in Florida. Oh, okay. That, okay. That's one of the 90% things that I agree with. I work for Greg Reed. I'm already there. All right. Anyway, you know, have a good day. I work for a man, Dumberton, Sawdust. Yes. Have a good day and keep going to the good job, Neil. Okay. God bless you, sir. All right. Okay. I've always said that. Believe it or whatever bubble might see you want. Just leave everybody else alone. That's all there is. Simple as that. Do not harm. Leave everybody else alone. Believe in little green goblins on the goddamn moon. Whatever you want. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I'm going to notice every single one of these web hates sites. It's the church of this and the world church of that, etc. And so on. They need you a little more dangerous than most of your so-called mainstream religions. But at least they're a little bit more forthcoming about where they're coming from. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile and open park. Hello. Yes, sir. Sound like you. No, no, no, no. I'm on a paper. Here's a paper on an open park. Let's say that. I got a job this morning, but I was in the clock. It was in the first place. You come on at 10, 10, 35. I get a police pull up. Tell me I got to turn you off. Not down. All along. All the machines I'm using. They don't hear that. They just hear you. I got to turn you off. We're in a police station. So I can't hear you today. But so I finished the job. I guess I could turn you back on when I get on the road. I just figured I'd let you know that in passing. I had to turn you off. Thanks for the good news. All right. Okay. Well, he's hanging around with a lot of wrong porters. I'll tell you that. Most of the porters love this show, baby. They love me. And of course, the ones that don't look out. 560, 560, 560. I'm just in a bad mood because I said that they got the impot police need mental help. And they know that they're not the ones you make the goddamn laws. They're not the ones that make policy. Oh, two more cops. By the way, do you see that on a cocaine deal? A big drug ring they had in mind. She didn't mess around with stuff like marijuana. That's small potatoes. It's like Frankie Pintangeli. They don't muck around with small potatoes. They go for the big stuff, the white powder. Here's another bulletin. We got more Cubans that drifted around out there at sea. There's another bulletin for you. Here's a mobile in the game. Hello. A nail. No problem. First of all, how come a cop the Blair Witch project? 60,000 bucks to make a home movie? Yeah. That's a good point. I don't crash. I think most people can make a home movie to the cost of the film. Yeah, for three cameras that have 500 bucks each, you know, and some film, pay kids 100 bucks to live in a wood for a week. That's like a $2,000 budget. I've been in my image for five years. I'm happy to say I'm moving out. All right. Yeah, going to go and back home to California. Oh. So, uh, I don't want to eat and the immigrants, the whole deal. Have it to get back to back to the USA. Okay. Well, so I had a fill for us. Are you sure? Absolutely. Okay. I've got another guy bailing out of this. God for second place. Yeah. That's one of those things we're stuck here. We got to make the most of it until we can get out. Counting the days, marking those days off on our website. Nice going by the way, Eric. 5, 6, 70, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line. I mean, you can dilute yourself. I saw some stupid letter at the end of the other day about Carl Heisen and the iguanas. What happened to that poor guy that was chasing the iguana in that lake? You see that? Dead. There's a message for all your kids out there. If you're seeing iguana in the middle of a lake, no matter how much you love animals, don't be chasing in a guana in the lake. Not worth risking your life for an iguana. Ah, Carl Heisen says, if it was a manatee, then you might want to think about jumping in. In fact, better yet, leave the damn entity alone, Carl. How's that sound? That okay. Oh, yeah. So the poll continues and virtually unanimous the Blair Witch Project, a real piece of trap. Anybody who's want to be honest will tell you that. And of course the people who want to be like in and hip and cool, etc. So I'll say, oh no man, you're wrong. It was great. Yeah. Yeah. God. I still think I got my roar. Allergie. This is the meal Roger cell. Oh, God. This is your brain. Any questions? No. There's a new movie called America Pie. But for group 15, it's gonna be a new sex roll down the ice. They make up, act to drag the still out of me. It's 90 minutes of absurdity. Pre-tube back to shot the chest new routine. All right. Little bad cam girl with her magic flute. The hot jet girl is her birthday soon. Bottom up, the first the beer goes down the shoe. How young is she? That's in the car. It's girl. Well it works. All fins look like such a jerk. You know, grab the apple pie. And goes through the urge. It is one roasting after another. Work work. We do use these fiddlers. We make fins big grins. She's in this drop in bed. They all can't believe in some stream. It's 95 percent of steam. Me, you will wonder why. They didn't call it half of time. It's not so money. It's too right. I think you're the American Pines. It's moving to 30. She's here. Will not be alive. The only teens on party after the prom. All the kids think this movie is the bomb. All right. We get into the cold and time. But 44 at 5.50 W to Q AM. What's that called American Fly? And by the way, speaking of people who belong behind bars for a long time, whoever invented the button fly, that person should be put away for a very long time. 5.607. What? Don't like button flies. Huh? It's an impediment man. I don't prefer them. I hate them. Dispies them. Or you didn't see Tom Green last week, or he's doing the thing with the zipper. He didn't see that? No. There's nothing like a zipper, maybe. 5.607.05.60. 5.60 on a mobile one line. Here's my knee beat. I need to go to Blair, which project last night. I've got to tell you it made me and my wife physically ill. I've got to tell you I wished they sold drama mean at the popcorn counter. Huh? That's how bad it was. The handheld camera business for 90 minutes. It was just terrible. My kids who saw it in New York. They said it the same reaction. I mean it made us physically ill. We had a sit-in or some sat-up. They'll lend it to get a jump-up. And I'm not kidding you. The only movie in history, I got to accept the excesses where they gave people a poop bag when they came into the... You should've, I'm telling you, they should've sold drama mean at the popcorn counter. Yeah. Was that bad? Excellent. That was... Anyone who saw the phone said they got to tell you. I was a reaction. I had and my kids in New York, obviously a generation younger than I, had the same reaction both of them. And we should've taken their advice. Don't see it. There you go. It was the only, I learned a hard way. I learned for yourself. Oh boy, you're right. It's terrible. It was the only movie that we could make at the time we were out. So we figured, okay, let's give it a shot. And it was... It was... North-eating. I'm not sure. It's a physically North-eating. Not because of the content. Yeah. But the story. But because of the way... The kid was in there. The photograph and shot. I can't believe that. I think the kid's in there. Okay, thank you very much. I'm going to do a good news. And don't do it again. Right. Five, six, seven. So there you go. As the beat goes on, maybe for the Blair Witch project, as we continue on masking the bullcrap. You know, I've told you this before. Most of life is artificial. It's synthetic. It's hype. It's bullcrap. Don't get sucked into the hype. One thing to get sucked in. But don't get sucked into the hype. Five, six, seven, five, six. The pound, five, six. The unimobile one line. If you saw it and you liked it, we're doing it to call it and try to justify your crappy taste. And you're probably like vanilla ice cream too. See, there were kids puking at the exercises. But the exercises was a great movie. That's the difference. And the exercises was really scary. Unlike this piece of crap. But a bunch of, again, no, I didn't see them. We've got a serious, I'll saw enough clips for crying out loud. The exercises. In fact, that's what they ought to do. They're at a force on these kids. They went so that like the Blair Witch project, they won't see a free screening of the exercises again. And you'll see what a real horror movie is all about. Here's a mobile and north-lautardale. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Long time, Mr. The Blair Witch project? Yes. Zero. What a bummer. A big, a- Oh, man, it was horrible. Yeah. There's a total left-down. Yeah. Okay, I'm glad you liked it. Thank you. There's a guy said it sucked. There's another one. How do you like that? You're getting something they can think they're teeth into because it bites the Blair Witch project. One of the worst pieces of crap. Any pseudo intellectuals that get on the media, there are national television, and are going on and on and on. Having a big circle, jerk. About, oh, gee, this is great. They should teach a lesson. They'll always be highly of producers. spend in their millions and millions for the big stars. Okay. I guess what movie I watched almost in its entirety again last night, as much as I despise Oliver Stone. And you know something? Every now and then, I'll get a mental block over somebody's name. And there's always a reason. And you know, and others will come as a shock to you because he's very, very famous. I can't stand him. The actor that's in the movie from the untouchables and the field of dreams and JFK. And you know, I can't think of his name. Give me a clue. What? Okay. Okay. Very grim. Okay. Awesome. Oh, geez. Now you see why I had a mental block. Kevin Costner. I mean, I know what like I know where my thumb is. Am I left hand. But for some reason, I just have a mental blind. And during the course of the movie, I kept thinking, what is his name? I mean, I'm a, and I can, my memory isn't going. Maybe I can think of horse races from 35 years ago. That's always the test. Here comes Bucky Dale on the outside with Francis, so here, I'd go on Francis. But anyway, JFK and I watched it again last night. And I don't know. If I get actually, I liked it better this time. Even though that part was your dish was horrible. I was a, and we said, this girl, but that's what they did. It was horrible. Still haven't seen more on the floor than you lie though. And then of course, the thing with the, what was his name? The, with the bad hair, play Shaw. Was that David Lee Schwartz that played the Clay Shaw? Yes. James Roolish Worts. Yeah, Tommy Lee Schwartz. But at any rate, yeah, the, you know, a little bit too, a few, you know, he's going to go home and mix some A2, What ever the hell I was, you know? A little bit too faggy for even me. But, well, the fact that it must be, you know, that Lee Harvey Oswald Schwartz. Here's a mobile in North Miami, hello. Hi, New York. How you doing? Okay, sir. Hey, New York, I have a couple of points. First, this one drugs is ridiculous. The one drugs that this country is perpetrating. The Warren Commission, all the Warren drugs, yeah. Yeah, I mean, their other doing is they're making the Southern American countries for, and like, for example, in Colombia, all this people, the highest per capita murders per capita kidnapping, horrible. And this hypocrite, do you hear what happened down there? The, the, the wife of the colonel of the embassy on the American colonel was being co-opped here. They were doing what? Yeah, they were shipping coke up here. Yeah. How much a hypocrite? And the second point. I prefer Pepsi, my saw. And yeah, yeah, second point. And, this Cuban, I don't understand. They're, they're coming over here. They're coming over here. Nobody knows Pepsi up there, knows. Anyway, go ahead. Yeah, Cubans, yeah, these damn Cubans. The damn Cubans are damn straight enough. These, the, the Anna Pickers, yeah. Yeah, they're, they're, they're coming over here. They're coming over here. They're making the, these flesh eating. Exactly, exactly. They're coming over here every day. They're getting dropped up to under your term, the coast. Yeah. Yeah. And that was it. I think, I think you just got hijacked by a Cuban. Rust by Bob Green, because he said something bad about the coast. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, palm 5, 60 on a mobile one line. What time was he talking about? Don't start with the Cubans again. They just because George came back today. Don't start with the Cubans. Here's Miami, hello. You might have wrong line. I must be. Here's Miami over here. Hello. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I'm one of your superstars. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. I got it. Excellent. I want to say how to my girlfriend. She's listening to you and she's in Gibraltar. She's listening on the internet. Yep. In Gibraltar? Gibraltar. Wow. A real country where nobody owned guns. Right. Not a me. All right. Keep it up. She's between Iraq and the hard place. Yes. That's right. My rock. Okay. You wish. He sent it to her by long distance. Score scored over the internet. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line on a really tumultuous Monday. Anybody believe that? No. I'm so glad that I saved the 5, 6 bucks. Not that I can't afford the 5, 6 bucks. But I just did not interest in getting vertical. See in a movie with a bunch of horrendous. I remember when they did that on the news. It's got to be years like 10 years ago. They started doing that. It lasted about a week. And the viewer complaints were so great. And everybody was going, why are they doing this? What is wrong with these people? We know they're crazy, but are they doing this with the shake rattle and roll on the God damn news? I think it was channel 4. I think they would have ones that were doing it. Right. The number of dinner. Nothing like turn on the TV news. And they got the shaky cam on there. I did like shaky speech about. I love shaky. Not as good as Godfather. You know, I don't care what anybody says. That was the best pizza that we ever had in South Florida. Was Godfather's. And the people here have got such crappy crappy taste that they went out of business here. Now they're hitting court in Omaha and I think they're still around. I do believe. I think. And some of the people like my old friend, Havier, how's my buddy, Havier from W.S. News Days who introduced me to Godfather's. Down there on candle on sunset drive. Anybody remember that? I bet you do. I remember Havier. Hmm. God. Oh yeah. I long for his pepperoni every day of my life. Havier. One of your people, I think. But they had a little problem with that family. You know, I think I had a little other nose out of join or something like that. But nevertheless, that was such a great place. Godfather's. Were that deep. Were that real. Oh, God was that good. The cheese on top. And they had the Mexican one. That was my favorite. The real spicy one. Hmm. And the pizza too. Ah, you can't live in a past. You got to move forward. You know, there are all these good things and the good things go the way at the wind and the crap. The crap. You know, McDonald's. They keep hitting bigger and bigger and bigger. More and more schmucks keep taking care of kids and McDonald's. And even I go there and Amsterdam because the rest of the food they're sucks. But the good stuff like like wavs. Wavs. WV was there was a hamburger chain that was a thousand times better than McDonald's. It was even better than Wendy's, which are like Wendy's. They had the best onion rings in the history of the human race at Wavs. And guess what they're gone. And they said, well, they tried to expand to fact. They should have been able to expand. That's because they were great. Wavs was sensational. Not good. It was great. And it's gone. Because the public out there, their taste is in there. That's the problem. Everything tastes like a penny to them. Here's a mobile and cruel spring, silo. Hi, Niam. How are you? Okay. Good. I'm a really lady from high Louisville for you. I was on 95 draft week. Oh, exactly.

What about? What about? What about? What about? Not want to treat incredible light of your strength. I'm a son, set more. I mean, these people are so slow, you know? Luis Miguel's voice is magical. Is that something new? No. How many years have I been telling the public that? Greatest voice in the world. I don't care what you say by the way, Mr. Greatest voice in the history of the human race. Luis Miguel. He's no Olympic biscuit, but, and by the way, they suck. Here's a mobile in Kendall, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You brought this up about an hour ago, but I just got to a phone. You've got to have you. Whenever. The wind's sure is dead. Yeah. The wind's sure is restaurant is still in business and still very good. Oh, right. His son Hans runs it now. Hans. Hans, you're right. He says you've even enjoyed the rills. Great restaurant. Yeah. I used to do a show out of the restaurant in Marshall. You were a luncheon at Schubert's. Right. I was there that I'm from Marshall. WALM and LB and Michigan. That I'm R.R. And Marshall, those are the days, baby. For about 75 bucks a week. Right. That's in the 19, not late 50s, early 60s. I was there in 64, I believe. Right. I went to Michigan State graduate in 62. All right. Okay. I'm going to be. He's your home in. All right. I'm going to go back to MSU. I'm going to go back and live in the dorm for a couple of years. I had a listen. I mean, if I knew that all of the honestly, they had so many ugly guys in that dorm. I think back at those in high school, I had great looking guys in candidate with New York. But in college, Jesus, guy with the ugly. Huh? Oh, yeah. They were really ugly in my dorm. Maybe what made it didn't tell me was just a dorm for the ugly guys. Because I know West draw. That was the dorm for the jocks. We know everybody ever went to see. I was confused because I thought that in my dorm was the moment. Nobody should go to class. So I didn't bother. Why Sean? I wanted to go to class. They also didn't buy any textbooks. How many textbooks you need for basketball evening and when surfing? Here's the mobile in Davy. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I want to know. I'll tell you a funny story about the Blair Witch Project. Yes. A couple of weeks ago, me and my buddy's wet knee. How can he Chinese food at this place in North Miami? And we then we flew down. Well, Charles, yeah. I was ridiculous. Then we flew down to the movie team. We got there late to move only one, two seats left in the front row. We're sitting in the front row full of Chinese food and then the way that's in the cell. We need to say my buddy got up and ran out and vomit it all over the bathroom. And it made me sick as well. We really enjoyed the movie. But I just want to tell you, listeners, don't eat all you can eat. Guys, it's the first. And then it's just a part of that of my ambient watch. Because you're looking for a top top 9. I thought it was better than like in the middle though. Wow, I mean, there was no one else for us to sit and we didn't think it was going to be a big deal until we saw how the movie was followed with the camera and shot. And, uh, shut up. Waffle heated and vomit on me. Have a great day. I had a good time. Okay. The least Miguel's voice is magical. So it says that bet cleaner. Nothing could be needed. Then a late name cleaner from North Burgundy, Jersey. I'll say that for tomorrow. We'll go into that. Hey, listen, look what I hit. We had with Jan and Dean today. Oh, that was big. I was gigantic. Even it listed it not one but two hostile factions from the same jackass out there. It's got a Jan very blow up though. I sure hope it looks like the Jan very before the accident. Here's a mobile in Boker. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. It's me. I'm a, hey, my wife said I was a chronic because I talked to more than three times in five years. I don't think so. Okay. They have been Tampa a few weeks ago. I had the afternoon off and they got this really neat little theater. A mill of downtown. For example. Yeah. And it was, there's a big mark. Keys sign outside said, Buster Keaton film festival. I thought, well, that's something to do on a Saturday afternoon. It's like over there. It's so nice to go. And I'd buy a ticket and it turns out it's the Blair Witch thing. I didn't know anything about Blair Witch. Yeah. So I didn't give, you know, I wasn't all excited about seeing it. I didn't know what it was. So I go and watch it. And before 10 minutes is up. I was thinking I was in the South Park movie the way they were using the F word so much. Yeah. And that must be why everybody liked it so much. There was an F word in there. Oh, yeah. I mean, it's like, you know, like the Serenap talk and F this up that. Yeah. And by the time the witch came on, I was hoping to kill all of them. Oh, Jesus, how you f***ing carrying me? Ha ha ha ha. They're really stunk though. That was one of the worst movies and all the, the no-spicken Tampa guys. They kind of have a movie said that's a terrible movie. Of course they even even the most picker's hated audio like that. I know, I was bad. Hey, one more thing I want to tell my buddy Bruce Raver. He's a ping pong, clandish bag. Okay. And have a great day. Don't do it again. Even in Tampa, they hated it. Oh, it was poison. 560, 50560, pond 560 on the AT&T line. Here's a mobile and lake worth. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Good afternoon. How you feeling today? Pretty good. I only picked up about an hour ago. Mr. Friday. I don't know if you were home Saturday, but the head of the head. Yes, I was. Yes, I was. This was the most boring weekend of my life. Well, my wife was watching TV with the kids and there were on Disney to head some special. It's a backstreet boy. Right. They're on for like two hours. My wife died. Who are these guys? She's she fell in love with them. You're like, they're like, why said who are these guys? Yeah, where's she hiding these days? What kind of a clown is hiding them all? But the bank she worked at. Okay. So. And when you talk about Godfather's pizza, do you know how these new gas stations are putting in like McDonald's and all that kind of stuff with them now? And Taco Bells. There's one in Stewart that I go by. It's Godfather's pizza. There's a Godfather's in Stewart. Yeah, it's a Godfather's pizza in a half gas station. It's a brand new place to open up. Yeah. I pick up a pizza, but if you call this hell about it, it's not my Godfather yet. Yeah. Yeah. It's a was great. And quote the deal. Have a great day. Okay, thanks. But now you're laughing. You're laughing. You just don't believe anything. You're laughing. Well, it is done a little unusual. Test gas. And yeah. If Godfather's don't keep it the gas, the guy outside will. It does seem a little bit bizarre. Maybe a hobby or a thing and I don't appear in Stewart. You know, maybe he's on a run. Maybe he's just got on the run. Those are the days, baby. The W. News days. Harvey here. Oh, boy. I can't remember him now. That's sad. Can't live in the past where you got to move on to, you know, like people say, Bigger and better things. New meat. So here's the facts from Mike and Naples. This is our flip past that you're last night. So I'm Jan Dougley mug. Oh, wait a minute. God, Jan Dougley mug. It was waiting for the belt out. Tipped out through the tool of the looks like Heidi Tim and Carnan. Whoever's planning to do it, we can go ahead and specify a closed past now that they have any respect for either of the two people who have been and his bubble drum crats. Thank you, Mike and Naples. Great. First the pick is top to base. What's up, Mr. You can. Oh, God. I'm never going to be covered from that. It was a you you can't. I'm sure you can't imagine in your wildest dreams. How anybody can go from like the age 25 to 59 and look like that. Look like that. Like Fred like Fred or said, you can't come to Vegas and talk to a man like Mo Green like that. Just like he said, those two works like that. And you think of Jan Barry looking like that. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Davey. Hello. Welcome. Yes sir. Good afternoon. When is to you? This this weekend. I was on the road and I had the unfortunate experience of tuning into Joey's a gacky. Oh. And you live to tell about him. I'm surprised you didn't follow me. I was going to say that was going to suit you. I am with that happened. This Thursday 2 to 430. Jack the gacky will be sucking his brains out right here on the air. We're pretty embarrassed about it. Yes. That's the warning. Not a promotion. Even Bluff came in here and apologized. You said we couldn't possibly get anybody else. You said we're sorry, but get off you stuff. Yeah. What I thought I'd try and do my fair shot. And after listening to it for about a half an hour, I came up with the following hypothesis. Yes. If you need a list, a big list of every activity you could do on planet earth. Yes. I don't think that you could find anything. Anyone of those activities that's more boring than listening to Joe's gacky. Correct. I'm so interested in the correct. Before I go, yes. Instead of calling someone to do Spag, I would like to point out someone who probably needs to do Spag. That lady fell asleep and pissed you off. Which one? The lady still is? Yeah. The lady was screaming in the parking lot that one day. Oh, our fellow, you mean the water not to you. Yeah. She probably said that. She's doing a small potato. She did me. Okay. Thank you, sir. That's the water not to you. Whatever you say, sweetheart. Another one of Greg's girlfriend's here. Greg and his boyfriend's in girlfriend's is a little intercircle of playmates. Greg's kindergarten. That's what we'll call it. Welcome to Greg's kindergarten. You heard a written Mr. Rogers neighborhood. This is Greg's kindergarten. Sam the sham, Lou N. The water not to you and Greg. So, nephew. And I guess, roar. Just by association. Or because he's got a big. Here's a lot of hell. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Neil, it's going. My name's Ian. First time calling. Yes, sir. Listen occasionally to your show. And I was just saying, how's your take on Joe's sucking a khaki? Yeah. Well, I was just wondering why they put Jim Manage on it. All right. And it's his other town. Oh, man. You think that we would put Joe's a gacky on unless we were absolutely backed up against the wall. Unless they were, they checked. They went through the phone book. They tried just names out of the phone book and everybody they called said, Oh, can't do it. And have a great day. 567560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. All we want to say is, Okay. Not too good. Try it again. Okay. No. Okay. Where we going? I just want to emphasize, just in case you missed out. Don't forget Thursday, 2 to 430, block those 2 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 1 1 1 2 3. Wait, can you see your numbers on that day, homperoth? You'll be sorry that you let Joe get those naked pictures. Are you with that Billy goat? God. Kenneth Moshmachio, Michael Mayo or Joseph Ackie. That's our pool question today. Which one is the most talented? The most exciting. And did Michael Mayo take one sentence from that rambling bunch of crap in his morning's paper to apologize to make his retraction today. Howlver stand? No. Absolutely positively. No. Scumbag. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Lady in Miami. Hello? Yes? No. No. This is a lady. This is some little kid, yes sir? I'm from. Yes. Screw this. Screw you. 567560, pound 560 on the AT&T. You're going to see if nothing like what a parent calls in and puts their little punky kid on the... But the good news is the kids will be back in school real soon. That's right. Well, I want to tell you what's again. By the way, I am. I don't want to sound like I'm petting myself on the back. Because this isn't really a great accomplishment after 23 years on a year here. I am such a star at publics of the saw grass, you know? Any place else like, uh, not too big. But I'm telling you at that publics are winning their last night to get a couple of things. And I had to change underwear four times before I even went through the checkout. And I only got like four items, you know? I want to the express checkout and I still had to change underwear 18 times before they let me out of there. Everybody was just tinkled. I think my whole audience was in there. All 10 of them. Just peeing all over me. I can't say that. Just the... Squared squirt all over. Why do I wear a handker? Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hi, Neil. How are you? How are you? How are you? How are you? Well, when you fall out from that street. Vacers street, out from originally okay, terrorists, and then, um, a Marina Drive and Brighton. Oh, I know where they're going. Right off, uh, like, Monroe Avenue, when they're there. Oh, sure. Yeah. I know where they're. Uh-huh. I got the 12 corners there. Uh-huh. Right by Brighton Elementary by Don and Bob's. I know where they're going. That'll be so great. Yeah. Used to be. Used to be. Anyways, do you want me to bring you some real white hot pack? No, what, Wayne Arnold's got all the white hot sweet can handle. Oh, they do. Yeah, right on. I think they fit the North 441. I did that. Can bring you. No, I don't think so. All right. A couple of snowballs. Okay. Have a good time. Bye. Say hi to our buddies and Vicketerves, bring back a garbage plate. We're just bring back some garbage. 5, 6, 7. I see Book of Rions here now. So we're going to be even more depressed. What's that? Oh, Brittany. I thought he would have brought in some Jan and Dean stuff. Being the great to all these expert that he is. He's probably to the press. Did you see that thing, by the way? The Vietha, he's seen them all. But did you see the Jan and Dean won? Jan Berry looking like, oh, oh my God. It's terrifying. It's super fine. You look at it and say, wait a minute. And they put, you know, they super little thing on the screen. Like Jan Berry, like over the body, they're like, just in case you're not sure. Absolutely positive. This is him and you say, no, that can't be him. Impossible. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. 30 minutes and 59 seconds later, where they're going. Thank you. Here's Pablo Beach, hello. Pablo Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. God. Speaking. I can't believe I got on. Neil, God. I think we said I'm calling as you were talking about movies earlier. And I just joined in. I don't know probably half a hour ago. And I don't know if you saw it. I saw one a couple of weeks ago called American Pie. Yeah. Did you discuss that already? Yeah. We'd spent about an hour in there. I think it's going to be a classic movie. Anyway, I'm from the Detroit area. You're listening to Dick Curtain for years. Right. And it's my good boy. He's a guy up there. Everybody love Dick. Dick is a great. He is. It's a great guy. He calls this you all the time. Yeah. Anyway, I just wanted to say hi. I've come here to hurt from Dick in a long time. By the way, George, maybe not hanging out of the Santa Bay. Let me more. He doesn't know we can pick up the station on 770 on a west coast. Had it hurt from Dick in a couple of years. Is he still on every day after? Sorry, I know. He's been on a couple of different stations on some old FM oldies thing. I think. Yeah, yeah. That's the last time I heard him is on FM station. Yeah. But he's got more lives. I listened to him. I listened to him back. Got to be 20 years ago. Right. He heard 13 WSYZ. Yeah. He's great. Great. Listen to. Anyway, I wanted to mention American pie. Probably the funniest movie I've seen since, you know, like animal house or something like that. I'm going to be a classic. I'm going to go see it today's matter of fact. I'm going to go see it again. Really? It was that good. Yeah. That's good. I'm going to go see it again. Really? It was that good. I'm going to go see it again. Really? It was that good. Yeah. That was that good. I'm going to go see it again. I'm going to go see it again. Anyway, that would go see American pie twice. Must like this. Of course, you probably haven't seen that. So, again. A slick name dick. That's big now. And somebody actually gave it a good review of it. They got to play this in the, uh, who knows? Who knows? Who knows? Just a lot of desperate people. Definitely try to make a lot of big money because the public is bored as all get out. Just thought that I was stubborn. So, played. Squared Squared. Still need that you love my eye. Yeah, no. I don't get to keep on checking my eye. Don't play the good, I'm very cute. I check out my breath that's open on my lips. That is it. It comes on to me. And it's a thing from my head. And it's a song of a, uh, but if you wanna do it, you know. That thing is about me. Don't think you're not. How young is too young. I'm young. I'm young. And I'm too young. You're sure that you're young. All right. So, you could go to jail. That's a thing you want me. Get up, please. You're under the frame of me. She was 25 but she's just a few. Don't think you're not. I'm a man of free. Very cool, but I'm a man of free. I'm a top-up victim. Because I'll have to tell things. Don't know my gut. She's a very good man. And I thought you think we're all in there. Oh, my shoulders. She's a very good man. She's a good man. She's a good man of free. And I'm a man of free. And I'm a good man of free. She's a good man of free. She's a good man of free. She's a good man of free. Well, the speakerphone sagged. You don't want to just threaten you. You want to give it out right now. Oh, look at that. How many times did they call 100? Yeah, well, let's give it out. Speakerphone sagged. I want to talk to the audience. What's your number? 305. Yeah. 272. 272. 272. 272. 275. What? 325. 60. 60. 60. 18. Where is line? Here's Hi, Leo. Hello. Perfect timing. The minute I get on the phone, so we'll watch from the door. Anyway, the work for God's hearts. Are you serious? Oh, yeah, about five years, five six years, right before they went out of business. The reason they went out of business wasn't because that allows you product. The reason why not a business, they try to get in the competition with pan, pan, pan, pizza product that pizza had at the moment. And they sunk hundreds of thousands of dollars worth. And the guy who owned a franchise right down here was Jerry, Jerry's, Jerry's, Husky. Right. When I noticed, he just couldn't handle it. They only raised the price by about a dollar. They couldn't handle it. Their pizza was 10,000 times better than the other. They didn't want to have it. When they tried to compete with the pan product, they're thinning crispy, which was the bread and butter. It was excellent. And you're right. There was nothing like to Godfather's pizza. When he used to work back there on the top of the way. They had a thinning crispy. Yeah, that's what they used to sell. It was a thinned, it was made in the same pan that the pan pizza had used for their thin product. They didn't call it thinned crispy. No, I don't remember that. We never had that. Oh, that's what they sold. That's what they sold. They were thinned product, hands down, that's what they sold. Maybe later on, but in the beginning, they never sold that. Are they only sold one kind of, it was deep dish? Not here. Here was all the time. Probably in the beginning when they first started. Oh, I guess maybe I've noticed, but not that here. No, no, I'm talking about here. Here? No, I don't. Candle. Really? I used to go there all the time. Oh, man, I don't remember what I worked for. Well, I was a lot more than five years ago. She said that this, this, this, this, this. Oh, no, what five years ago? When I worked for that was many, many years ago. Yeah. Way back. And then I went to work for pizza for about eight, eight years or so. Yeah. I got to know your buddy Red there. Oh, yeah, Red is a great guy. He's a Zoltam Spodler in law by the way. He works in our sales department. Yeah, he's a great guy. He's a good guy. All right. Well, I thought. Okay. Thanks. Okay. You know, I think I'm going to be pizza anybody. No. No. You do? Towards the end. Oh, yes. Let's try to tell this guy. Toward the end. That's probably where they made a mistake. If they wanted to compete with a thin and crispy from a pizza hut. They're, they're bread and butter was not thin and crispy. There were their whole thing in the beginning. They only had one kind. And that was the thick deep dish. Oh, my God. Was it good? It was great. The best. And now we got, you know, I, I want to hear the little thing about pizza. The pizza down here, you know, the hotels here. We got our buddy bread over there at Tony's in the course. There's Jeff and pizza loft. That's a good old standby. But anyway, five, six, seven, five, sixty pound fine. Now I'm talking about like, you know, like dominoes. Home delivery stuff. Oh, my God. God. God. I'd rather eat cardboard would like a little sauce and cheese on dine dominoes. I don't want to, you know, start picking on our good friends and dominoes. Are they a sponsor on a station? Does anybody know? We don't know. I mean, that stuff, you've got to really be really desperate to get dominoes. Here's a payphone and Davy. Hello. Yeah, this is Charlie. I love your show. Yes. And now, every Sunday, let no dirty seat. It's the fireplace and listen and the NFF. That's the place and listen. I'd be there twice a week. So I'm one of the tables because if I pay tax to pay tax, then the tax station, if I represent. Right. That's true. I can't do that. Okay. Keep playing your seed man. Okay. It's good enough for the cops to do it. They're planting their seed. Mostly in those young prostitutes. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Whatever happened to Dave the cop either way, which he didn't hang on. He was on there before and I've been wondering where the hell he was in the middle of all his scandals. Let's go on. All maybe Davy's busy down there and candlelight himself. Never thought about that. Maybe he had to make a run. Here's Pembroke pine. Hello. He's done pretty good. You can laugh at me to show that some of the 20 and 3 of ever heard my life. Yeah. We're listening not to jump on a bag of sandwagonians. Roy. Joe's a jackie. It's one thing to put him on the radio so I can drive off the road to keep coma. But who is the decision was it to put this man on television? He looks like the poster boy for the special Olympics for God's sake. Yeah. That's right. When I ride mouth of a... He's got a lip from here to rear of the sky. My kids see, oh look the monkey man's on television. Ahaha. Oh my god. Yeah. Is it like a special hiring like you know for any cat people or something? Yeah. Yeah. We had to get our quote in you know. I can't call someone a douchebag. Yes sir. Mark? You're a douchebag. Okay. Just saying no to Joe. That's our model here at QM. Just saying to Joe. Well here's Dave the cop. Well that's your didn't take long talking about having a real real real life. How you doing now? What happened to you? Did you drop off? I'm not working there. I'm off today and I was in the cell. Well you do make the warm donuts come out or something? I don't eat donuts come on. Anyway not. Just a guy been waiting for last two months dear from you the story on when the when the the big stories going to blow. So to speak. I don't know. I don't know. I guess this is good as mine. Well you know what can I tell you about that? I was driving in highly. I live in highly and there's two who are going to warp speed drag racing. They just had a big article and today's Harold and naturally it's out of control with these people thinking it's Daytona. So I am poor. Anybody that catches up wouldn't have met the light if the driving recklessly pull them out of the car and take their car keys and put them in a mailbox or something. Right. And really out of control. It's getting to a point. What does that have to do with the prostitution ring that I asked you about that you were evading the question. I don't know what to tell you about that. But you should have some buddies that are banging over 16 year old six down in candle and highly. I mean highly is your neck of the woods. Well you know we got our Britney Spears posters. We don't need to be dealing with prostitution. Oh there you go. But anyway that movie I thought the movie was great. You're all talking about despite the wobbling there was some great feeling in there. I'm sorry that's the Paul Blair project. This we got it. Okay. All right buddy. Two weeks. Okay. I'm so glad that I called him. I hadn't called back. Not. But anyway he means well. Ever wonder what happens to four skins once they've been ripped. Well what's the clipping is done. Those incredibly strong little helmet covers are sent to the four skin factory where they're made into some of today's most innovative products.

So anyway we get a package here of FedEx from my good close personal friend John GOEA. I don't know how you pronounce it. GIO EI EI EI GIO EI. How would you pronounce that? GIO E whatever. GIO the hitman. Oh that's right. Wrong station. Sorry. What kind of name is that anyway? GIO the hitman. You know. Oh god. So anyway here's a letter. I'm dear Mr. Rogers. I have to many years of enjoying your program. I know what the response would be too but don't ever be able to get to it. They will discuss this tomorrow. Great line. It's an invitation for me and a guest I guess. And I'm not going to eat $100 worth of food. To the eat a dinner at the New York prime, which is all the way up there in Boka. First of all I wouldn't have any idea how to get there. Do you know what I'm saying? Crib and green bombs New York Prime are stay-cows. Finding a New York Prime is truly a dining experience that I'm sure you will certainly enjoy. Even in close to reviews. First Robert Toff. I'll remember Robert Toff used to be on with Sandy all the time. Remember him? Oh yeah. And it goes on and on who's the other review by? Oh the Palm Beach Post. Raving great reviews that go on and on an extraordinary spectacular 18 stars. Well thank you very much John and we'll be up there one of these days when he at least expected. Okay. And I'll say who the hell are you? Okay. Let's go to sunrise. Hello. Anyhow how's it going? Pretty good sir. Hey I just want to tell you something. Have you heard some of the other, I mean not me. What is it? What is it? Hanks, promos, that put the crown of light in a commercial. Some of his promos. You know the commercial they does for crown of light. The light spots. Do you ever heard any of them? Yeah. Like Chuck throwing everyone out the alcoholism. What's wrong with that? Oh yeah I heard him knocking that one that he was saying. Well that's the copy. That's the crappy copy we get around his place. And you're right. I know the one you're talking about. I can't wait to get a new one for him. Yeah. Why can't we get some new because we got the sales bits that's too worried about the disrupting the show and I worried about doing her job. Good points sir. Even a listener's no. I heard Hank carrying on like a child about that one day right on. Humber. Why don't you talk to him. I can't complain about the copy but get here because we don't get any. Like a John penis. You know you can come in here with your butchered up face John penis. So all you want to fact is are you going to give us any new copy? That's the point of these people doing their job. No. And we got a general manager walking around here with his finger in that deep hole in his head. Oh don't be picking on Sam and Roy and screw her. Yeah. Yeah. Like a child. A child with a play toy. That's what we got here at dangerous. A child with a play toy. It's like that eight year old girl that they had going up there on Jessica with a plane. She said. That's what happened when you put a guy like Greg Reed and tried to make your market radio station. The luckiest man on the face of the earth. There he is. He don't even know it. He's the luckiest man on the globe because what he knows about this business. You could put it in a symbol and have room for Roy's spectrums left over. Here's Western. Hello. Neil. How are you doing? Great. Listen. You're talking about the Godfather before. Yes. What's going on? I heard news about a fourth one coming. Ah. History of history. Mario Poosos dead and they said no way Jose. Real to cry. No way. Because Al Pacino started to look like okay. Thanks. 560, pound 560 on the 18T line. Hey, Tim Wright did it. The Al Pacino died in the third one. Okay sir. He died. Remember the little the food on the ground? Or was it the pair on the ground? Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Here's the lady in Miami who set the phone down for some strange reason. Hey. Yeah. That's a little kick back. Oh, that's so stupid. A little kid again. How do you like that? As well as the same mother. The same bitch puts him on a phone again. You know what I think? I think now where was that call was for Miami? I thought for a minute, I might have been that the Sherry. You know, that bitch Sherry, the one I wanted to eat. Your free back sweet boy tickets. I talked about it the beginning of the show today. Yeah. So maybe it was that bitch. Who writes me this glowing. If you must have been getting the show the most embarrassing. I mean, suction, sucking and sucking and everything I like in your genius in your mouth. And then in the last paragraph, oh, can I get some of my back sweet boys tickets for her daughter and Punky Little niece in the answer is no. No. Boy, you got a nerve Sherry. Just like all the other way. I feel I want to extend my personal condolences to all the heterosexual men of South Florida. Because most of the women, 95% of women out there. Like I said, 99% of the women out there. I want, I want Guinea, Guinea, Guinea, Guinea. That's all they want. And what you want to give them, they don't want that. They want for free. That's all they want about your free loading torps. By the way, torps. Isn't that a great word for Joseph Gackie? Uh-huh. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. I was calling regarding a Godfather's pizza. Yes. I just moved here from Seattle and the Godfather's was the best pizza up there. All right. And the thin crust is the newest version. That's too bad. Deep vision was great. Oh, yeah. All right. Well, are not making that anymore? They are still in Seattle, yes. Yeah. But the pair we're not here. Yeah, Godfather's not here. They're like all the other good stuff. You can't find it here. This show was the only good thing you'll find in this town, man. Well, I've been here about a month now and so far I have to agree with you there. Just wait. Just wait another month or two. You'll be on the first bus. I'm a bit afraid to. Okay. Good luck, pal. All right. Thanks. There's a Godfather's report. You see, stuff that's good. All of it. We did finally get a steak in shake. Where was it in Boit and Beatrice somewhere? No. Was it? A couple weeks ago the guy called and said it was open somewhere up there too far for us. We're still waiting for the one out there. 136th of Panther Parkway and sunrise. Anybody seen that yet? No. If it's good, if it's a hit, if people all around the world like it, are we going to get it here? No. We got to wait because this is the last place that most businesses want to come to. Well, probably because we don't have a stadium in Broward. That would be the reason. Huh? Yeah. They just fill the new stadium and Seattle out there. Build the new stadium up there. They just open that one up. So that must be the reason they got a godfather. That's what the Sun sent us. It's going to be telling you next. If we get a new stadium, there'll be a steak in shake on every street corner. A godfather's pizza right behind every house. Yeah. You know, somebody needs to investigate and see what this scam is with a Sun sent on their Hearny-Eatic desire to force you taxpayers and Broward to cough up some money to build this billionaire god damn stadium. There has to be something more than meets the eye because they're psychotic about it. I must be crazy. I must be not all of the above. Tandy force that we got this nice certificate. I mean, I got this nice certificate from New York Prime up there in Boca, which is much too far for you guys to be driving. Huh? Well, maybe they'll invite you to come up there someday too. All I did love that great meal at Macaroni Grill, except for that's far to that was singing on the table. I mean, I'm serious. I'm dumbfounded. We just said they're like, uh, what's this? The lights go down. I'm thinking, geez, did they pay the goddamn bill. Greg Reed must be running this place. Didn't pay up the NL. The lights get in and you're speculating, oh, something dramatic is going to happen right now. And it did. Oh man, River. Seriously, I mean, are you people crazy over there? You got a pretty good joint, but you know, always find a good way to screw it up. No, seriously, air me place in this town. They find a real good way to screw up a good thing. Like this station, you know, give me here our morning show.
