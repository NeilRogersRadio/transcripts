I'm a little bit scared of you. I'm a little bit scared of you. I'm a little bit scared of you. You called me on, strange draws off, and claims there are no shoes, you looked like you had to save me them and not never catch a guardians office. Mashi Blanca Two and on a 12 on that. The adal made 10,000 this morning. Oh, and it's underneath it again. People on CNN, I'm going to tell you something. I don't want to, you know, pee on your parade. Or we all got money in the stock market. Anybody that's come more than 10 bucks to their name is got something. We got mutual funds. They got stock. They got something. We all got sucked into this big gamble. This big charade. Like, you know, somebody gets out there got sucked into one of their phone. He's fight. See, I don't understand. It's like somebody goes to the racetrack and they bet some money on a racer. Oh, gee, that racer looks fixed. Yeah. Same thing with these boxing idiots, you know, it's like going to a professional wrestling. Oh, I think this thing is rigged. And what's the point? You know, that business about a sucker is born every minute. They just keep coming back and coming back. Come on, punish me with me. Beat me, et cetera. But getting back to this stock market, which by the way, let's see. Oh, look at that. Wow, 65 points away. How the mighty of falling. 15 minutes ago, they were like, Maria Bartiroma was jumping up and down on CNBC and CNN was like, even high-preventinating 100 times worse. Major breaking news, you know, it's just an artificial number. But it's that pack mentality that's not college. You know, we broke through 10,000. Oh, my God, this guy isn't falling after all. Oh, I don't think it's unfortunate. Aren't we? Are we getting rich? No. Because we get sucked in by, and like I said, yesterday, everybody's in export. This one tells you it's a bull market. And the other way, it's a bear market. And the other one, well, we don't really know. It's all a bunch of bulls. What it is, crap. Because nobody really knows. And yes, some people got lucky and some people got some good insight and information. Some people got some bad insight and information. But to watch the way these people were hyperventilating this morning and there, it's throwing paper, throwing confetti around there. Like, like, we didn't like what was New Year's Eve. And guess what? Now we're 67 points away and dropping like a rock. I hate to break the news to you. But at any rate, it's only cash, boys and girls. It's only money. Yeah, what happened in here from yesterday today with the overhead? I don't know. Socks from one extreme to the other. But nevertheless, it's the QAMF in way, baby. We don't want to start complaining technical. Well, I got about 35 million things today. And thank God for that. Because after yesterday with this, oh, brother, with this crowd. Guess what I got in the mail of home yesterday. And my Florida Panthers play off tickets in voice. No. Yes. It's right. They want 125 bucks is what they want. 1080 for playoff rounds one and two and 120 bucks for a playoff park. What do I care that you reimburse me here anyway? What do I give a crap? If I wait long enough. But it's just the idea. See, I want you to understand. This is for all the season ticket holders. Now, we still got about what? 16, 17 games left in a regular season, something like that. And it's a very good chance that this team is not going to make the playoffs. Very good chance. Especially if Pavel Burrito come back very soon. And the room around the league is he ain't coming back to the right of the season. He's out for the year. That's the rumor. Not in this town, but around the right of the league, they're whispering, I guess, while he ain't coming back this year. Which if in that's the case, it's going to be real tough. So stop and think about this. You don't get refunds on your playoff tickets. You have to put them on the up by a certain date, which in this case, they wanted by, what's today's at Wayne once my money buy? March 26th, that's only like a 10 days away. If you want to so up those, they play off around one to tickets. And if they don't make it, guess what happens? They hold your money and they credit it toward next year's bill for next year's tickets. How would you like to have a scam going like that? Were you just basically hold on to people's money as long as you want and you make the interest on it? I mean, figure out. We got about 16, 17,000 season ticket holders. Times at least, however much it is, you know, and then the sweet, the sweet and the boxes, got only knows how much those besters have to pay for the playoffs. And they just kind of hang onto your money. So like I said, the suckers boring every minute. And yes, I will be sending in the money because thank God they reimburse me from here. I found I came across in this book, Volga Favres by Marine Ortha, about the Kuranan in the story. Found one page for getting about Andrew Kuranan and Gianni Brasachi that ties into something we've talked about on this show many, many times. And yeah, all these people in the audience who professed an ignorance of this, you'll look for the glory hole. This may give them a little bit more insight, although it's really bizarre. Very strange. Wait for your this. It says between the stalls in a men's room on one of San Diego's Navy bases is a waste high hole, barely large enough to accommodate a man's finger. One time is the best time to visit it, Stephen Zeland writes in the article Killer Queen Public Enciedles Game Magazine the Stranger. Holes like this are known as Glory Holes. In 1995, Zeland says he told Jade Buckman about it and especially beautiful man he'd seen there three times. Turns out this guy was Jeff, uh, wasn't they? Jeff Trail, one of the guys that can any killed. The guy was shy and only once briefly did he kneel down, now listen to this, and in accordance with the prevailing etiquette, stick his penis under the stall. Most of the time we just watched either through the hole or took turns sticking our pinkies through it, touching just barely the tips of each other's penises. Zeland learned why identify the man by the cartoon mouse tattoo on his ankle. But, let's go back to that one line again. According to the court, it's the prevailing etiquette etiquette. Only once that he stick his penis under the stall. Now we've all been in public restaurants, right? Now you know where the stall comes down to like what we just say a couple inches above the floor? Yeah, not more than a foot. Right? Oh, listen to that. How do you stick your penis under the stall? Not me. Oh, man, you're looking for glory home. That is bizarre, baby. Pretty good book though, by the way. Pretty interesting. If you're interested in that which I know none of you are, stick their penis in accordance to etiquette. Now is that like Martha Stewart, written about that or Amy Vanderbilt in the book of etiquette? That if you're going to give a proper greeting at a glory hole, you stick your penis under the stall. As a member's only under the stall. Oh, bad news by the way, it's an epidemic. That's Superman, another one. Kirk Allen never heard of. I'll say that. I'm still going to speed him, bullets. Okay. After Kirk Allen, the dance you followed for in Red Skull and the Hollywood became films first Superman die after Longulis. He was 88. That's old enough. He was a violent die on Sunday in a hospital. They were his home in the Woodlands, Texas, north of Houston. Superman, the comic book, you're aboard in the depression already. You can't see the imagination of the generation of children in print and on radio. Well, I missed a rally and agreed to play the part 1948. By the way, Bob Conner used to play Superman on radio. Do you remember Bob Conner from To Tell The Truth? Huh? He's dead. Let's see. But Conner's dead. He was Superman. This guy Kirk Allen just died. He was Superman. George Reeves played Superman. He's dead. Blu, blu, his brains up. And Christopher Reeve, not dead. But I have it a count of a tough time of it. So there you go. I guess Superman wasn't quite so involved with the althought. You know about that Jimmy Olson, though, you know what he was? 10 minutes after 10 at 5. 60. In fact, he's probably looking for glory holes. Is he dead? Jimmy Olson? Huh? The actor that played for Olson? Dead or alive? There's your challenge for this morning boys and girls. You know, I don't have no idea what her, it's name was. Where you fudge back then? We're so sorry. There's this rotten one. We don't stop and go to the cities. You said we're crazy. We're so sorry. And this rotten one. But the past needs time will set into the fix. We're all the audience of things. He sent you every 50 but you're dressing completely. He has to deal with things, very something other than your future way to call. We're so sorry. Every time he just, you can see his basketball. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. He's a little bit sad. one of you know, same old craft, Dennis Robb and part of the scenery. That's what it says this morning. It's come sentinel. Panthers aren't their own professional athletes at the hard rock hotel in casino in Vegas. Dennis Robb and Denise Robb and who left the yelakers base supposedly because he had personal problems to take care of. Well, maybe had gambling problems to take care of because these plunging his brains up in Las Vegas. There we go. Lakers won 10 in a row with him in line up at lost to Sacramento 105 to 101 without him in line up on Sunday night while he was plunging his brains out in Las Vegas every game. A great old time. The NBA forward we're seeing out on the town several times Sunday and Monday it is typically flashy outfits looking like a real piece of crap. What can like a real asshole. And there you go. And I heard like about 30 seconds of that conversation this morning about the Panthers being in Vegas and about you know what kind of a message to that send and all the young kids on the team in this and who gives a crap, you know, when you come right down with what difference is it made? Let him go out there and have a good time. Let Robb need him our plunger way. His lunch money. Okay. Maybe he'll learn what hungers we saw about. What the hell did he do to his amic? It's you know going out there and playing the game. It's a lack of talent. That's the problem. And I'm still I still am amazed that a team with this marginal personnel without Palmville beri is really right around the 500 mark and still love very close only a point out of a playoff spot. So they ought to be kissing the ground. By the way, speaking, a kiss in the ground, Joe Costello is a good guy. I've got very bad taste and sports. In fact, Joe Costello really is in the sports fan, which is why he's going to be doing a new show on our station. Starting this Saturday morning. Let's hear it for Joe. I hope that his arm doesn't fall off before the show starts. Do you see that thing yesterday was yesterday was red today it's green and his arm too. Looks like a little again green cinnamon. This Saturday, motorsports Saturday will be added to the weekend schedule here on Q&A, the show hosted by our own Joe Costello. Famous for his track announcing at Marozo Motorsports Park in West Palm Beach, it says will air weekly at 6 a.m. 6 to 7 o'clock every Saturday morning just before default in the trade out show. The show will feature a weekly look at the motorsports racing world including the Nanscar, Cart, IRL, NHRA as well whatever all it is as well as local motorsports say. And anybody care about that? Oh yeah, millions of this is the most popular sport in the world, even bigger than golf. Please join me in welcoming this new show to the QM lineup and wishing Joe success on his new adventure says Dufflensy. Oh, by the way speaking of all of that. And the thing I read from the book about the glory holes. So I went down the hall this take a leak this morning. Since we're now up on the third floor and we don't have new facilities up there. Two big glory holes drilled in the wooden partition between the stalls in there. Any ideas on who drilled those? Uh-huh. Seriously. Two enormous not one but two big glory holes drilled in the wall. Here's a letter to the editor in the Herald again. Now this one just to see I'm tempted to go both ways on this letter because we know that the Herald basically are a bunch of blue nose anti-smitted cancels but as far as being racist they could be. I don't know. But I don't know about you but I'm just sticking to this kind of crap. Just like on the front page of the paper architect for arena under fire for the new American Airlines Mickey Harrison mayor of Pina Serena affirmative action violation is alleged. I can't stand the way I sound in this room. I can't tell you how to yesterday and today I feel like instead of doing a show. I feel like I'm doing an out of body experience. It feels like the show is going on but I'm watching it from the outside like a ghost because it just sounds like crap. But anyway the official the architect of the new American Airlines of arena street contractors could be bounced from the job and barred from doing business with Miami-Dade County for a year for allegedly violating the county's rules on affirmative action. In other words they didn't hire enough spows and stores I guess is what that means. I thought we were passed that I thought we were getting rid of that crap. So we have to have quotas and you have to hire enough people regardless of what they got in IQ larger than their penis size or they can stick it underneath the stall in the at-the-roll. So getting back to the letter to the editor which is from Bradford Brown second-by-is president of the NAACP Miami-Dade branch Opalaka. Here's the letter. Very short and sweet and it really makes my blood boil when I'm re-crap like this. I mean see if my life was that empty that shallow or maybe that perfect that this is the only kind of stuff that I had to worry about. I'd say yeah! The perception that the Harold is insensitive to many of the concerns of the black community was enhanced recently by the coverage of the Grammy Awards. The Harold ran a picture of Madonna but not Lauren Hill. The New York Times ran pictures of both. In of letter to the editor from the local NAACP chapter in Opalaka. Is that unbelievable or what? You're much erasist because you're in a picture of Madonna and not Lauren Hill. First of all we all know Madonna whether we like her whether we can't stand her whether we think she can sing whether we should think she's a scank and a scumbag and smells bad. Whatever we think we know Madonna, everybody in the world. Even people like wouldn't know the president would know their own parents. They know Madonna. Lauren Hill? If Lauren I mean I know who she is she's a hip-hop a rap singer okay who won the Grammy. I can't stand her because she did out the back door boys for the best new artists of the year in the Grammy. But nevertheless, if she walked in the door right now if that door swung open right now and it was Lauren Hill would anybody in her recognized? No of course not. Have no idea who the hell she was. But it's racist again because you're pita. I mean people looking for problems. People looking to get pissed off. People walk it around with a big big chip on her shoulder. And I'm sick and tired of it because it is the American Fnwak. It's really, really old and tired. By the way speaking of old and tired we're in our new studios up here on the third floor which sound really bad and near to me by the way. But nevertheless, so I walk out of here yesterday a few minutes after two. Usually it's right at two but we were trying to unscru some of the stuff that's screw up and you're I walk out a few minutes after two and here Sam the sham has got a little office in there our promotion man. And as I'm starting to take a couple of steps down the hold of the door and mark exit. I hear Neil, where are you going? I said home. I'll come on and sit down for a minute and I kind of wandered over to the door and I give me a whimsical quizzical look. I said hi. It's a new idea. I come on sit down for a couple of minutes. I said for what and he just looked at me like and I started like again hitting down. I'm where you go? I said home and as I kind of waddled out of here and down the elevator I was thinking to myself suckling as I went down that little bit of your shaft. What in the world could I possibly talk to that man about? Promoting this show? I mean that you know is a given we don't have any promotion on this radio station. What in the world could I possibly talk to Sam the scam about in his little office in there? About the business? No. About life? No. About his girlfriend? No, about all the free tickets that he gets to all the events in concert? No. But all the action he's getting in the QM skybox? No. No, nothing that's of any interest to me. What can I possibly talk to that man about? So I hope that this fascination with the fact that we're up here on this floor ends real soon because the one good thing is that we got you just go straight around. You follow the corridor right around to the right. You make it out of and you're right there at the door. You slide along the wall there. You're right at the elevator. You're going like a shot. Just like a shot. That's it. So don't be bugging me anymore Sam. Okay. I got nothing to say to you. Other than goodbye and have a nice day. By the way, the market is down 22 points. So now it's a long way from that you for you of about 40 minutes ago when across 10,000 and they were jumping up and down on TV like rumple stillskin. Like they just all had multiple orgasms together. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Hey, hi, now. Our first call of the day. Yes. Are you doing? Okay. I got one story to tell you that I've been able to get out of my mind yet. I work for Miami Day Transit and Sunday. We were at Birkel Station. We were providing a show to buses to the cardiovascular event. Yes. And also at the station there were five police officers with T-shirt multi gang unit agency. And a group came in. They all had money. Yeah. Except for one disc or except for one girl. She didn't have the $1.25 that get inside the metro station. So she was asking around people for the $0.25. She was so high. She couldn't be any more than 17, 18 years old. Yeah. And they was this muscular police officer. Really young. He took her to his car. He took a Polaroid camera and she lived her dress up and he took about four pictures of her hiding. I can't believe that. Back home. Yeah. We don't need that. That's incredible. Yeah. Okay. Well, Colis, when you have your next one of these. Okay. We have another hot flash. All righty. Okay. Thank you. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 50, 60 on the mobile online. Anybody else got any stories like that out there today? Come on. Even make some up. That's what this audience is good at. I mean, when you don't have a life at least make one up. Here's a pop at a. Hello. Yes, sir. Go. I report from the scum Sentinel. If you haven't seen it already. Yeah. This is a chronic. Yes. Republic. So Kendall, Toriota, back to the original owners. Really? Yeah. Now, too bad. We're done with them. Yeah. They lose. Yeah. Have a look at that. We published stock in the market went up 82 points yesterday. Republic is 13 and a quarter I think it closed that yesterday in the toilet. Have a good one. Okay. Thank you. Thanks for the good news, chronic. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the mobile one line. Let's have a few phone calls on here. Today, let's talk about white spider bites. You know, today's thing is I got a sore breast bone. You know, right here? What? I mean, not that sore, but a little sore. I don't know from what? From getting old. Eggs and pains. How to hell the wine? I'm not going to start panicking. Every day I got something new and different. My spider bites are healing up very nicely. Look how nice that's coming along. Now that that's the taking care. Now I got a sore breast bone probably from rust sucks. Probably from hot gay sex on the plane. By the way, Hank, you're right about Delta. They suck. God, they suck. They're food sucks. They can't take off on time. They can't do anything right. They haven't got to clue what they're doing. They were saying airline that used to really love was Delta Airlines. Years ago, I mean, it's a long distant memory now. And now they are garbage. Man, they really blow. But you know, you don't have much of a choice. They got you coming and going. That's one of the great things with the airlines. They got you right by the short here is because there's very, well, whatever happened to that national airline member. There was supposed to start in January, your February the latest nonstop direct flights from the Fort Waterdale and Miami to Vegas. Anybody ever heard any more about that? No, not a word. I don't get that. There's more guy than people that go from here to Vegas that love Vegas, that just wish they had some action going on in their lives. And you have to go through Atlanta. That's your Dallas. You got to go through a big, you know, and then of course, that Dallas airport, especially if you take American. We want that one trip with us. We had to go get on that damn shuttle and go outside. It looks like you're going around the whole border of the state of Texas, which is the size of Alaska. By the way, Jesus Christ, take you by the thank God. We had enough time to make the connection. In the next load, we'll go find the Nigger and drag them down the road. We'll be proud you're from the South boy. Double wide, Southern Bride. Now if there's a beer, we'll all live in Traftainside. We'll break her in the Asyns dealer first before she dies and ever prays the Bible to Dallas. They are barbarism ignorant and seizing a dragon. Break that is. Fire up some guards. Looks too. Now we are the Christian soldiers of God who like to wipe our house with an old foreign God. And when we're not burning churches or clinics, then we play our bandos in the trees with pieces in our mouth. That's what Christians require right there in the old ground. 33 of 560 WQM. By the way, does there a crossover between country music and NASCAR? I mean, you asked your cost. Next time you pops this head in the door, P. Lux Country music. What are you grinning about? Pick it and grinning. That's what that's all about. Daylern Hart is here. I'd ride. In fact, I was watching the Hurcouans play a hockey game last week. I forget what game it was. And they had a much bigger than usual crowds. And to usually have about 500 people in there and greens were out in the middle of nowhere in Yenem'sville. And they had a lot of people there. And they were saying, oh yeah, daylern are one of those, I don't know, the names. One of those good old boys. He's here today is riding the Zamboni in between periods. He's signed an autographs. All right. So I think there's a big crossover between that auto racing and country music. I bet your Garth Brooks likes auto racing a lot. Here's our one call on the board. Here's Holly Wood Hello. Hello? Yes sir. How you doing, you? Okay. Listen, I just wanted to know some about Lauren Hill. Yeah. Technically, she's not a new artist. She was a member of the food cheese. A group called the food just about four and a half years. Yeah. So I don't see how she could have gotten a new artist for a Grammy. Yeah. And I thought I'd just go, that's how I got new. Okay. Thanks. That's all the audience has today. So like I got my board on a week's time. Okay. And when it's comedy, we've looked one. And when I'm about to face the faces, one by one. Here up on, here it's something to hear about. Oh, it's spirit airline. 560, 560, 560, and a mobile one. So far our experience our second day in the new studios. I would write it as an un-mitticated disaster. The worst. You know something, I finally figured out why my breastbone hurts. You know what it is? Huh? We ended up against the counter. Right. Remember I mentioned that yesterday at the end of the show? This is exactly where this wood is. I got wood on my chest. Well, seriously. The wooden edge. I mean, maybe if I was in in a height here, how about it could this chair raise up? Because this is not going to fly. I think it's up all the way. How about the chair? This is definitely not going to fly. Sounds like crap it here. My breastbone is aching. I'm wondering. You know, last time I go into bed, I thought, what's what that was that? Something new and exciting? I haven't had enough other aches and pains in insect bites and all kinds of crap going on in my life. And then I realize right now I'm sitting here and I'm like pressed up against the counter. That's way to hell too high. Way to hell too high. How come late and have it like up to my neck would have been good? Here's plantation. Hello. Hey, you need to go back to talk about flight alignment at all. Okay. Thanks a lot, asshole. Jack asked. Who's the drummer for Franklin Island by the way? Her tank yesterday talking about Ringo Star. When I'm Vegas didn't see the flight night's going heck. And when I ring or star concert and about the Todd Rungren. By the way, the great song Todd Rungren hand was not the hello it's me, which was with the nags. It was I saw the light. That was a great record. Oh, I liked Todd Rungren. Great. And then he was talking about the guitarist for a cream was in this group with Ringo. And I thought the guitarist for cream was there a clap and blow it or I know. You know, I could be wrong. Huh, sunshine of your glass. And also the drummer from bad company. And then some suck ass calls in. Oh, you know, you're right. So Ringo Star is really underrated as a drummer. And I thought to myself, first of all, like I said last week, drummers are very rarely. Once it went wild and drummer and it most peed most of the time you even know who the drummer is. Because the drummer almost always is the guy who's the least musically talented, like Dennis Wilson in the beach boys like Joey Reynolds in aerosmith. Oh, by the way, in speaking of aerosmith, finally heavy, heavy duty, finally after all this time. I get a CD in the mail from my Columbia record club, and no, I'm not giving it away. And you can't have it. Did I actually want a little sound vicinity by aerosmith. And I usually hate hate live concert albums. I can't stand them. But this one happens to be absolutely sensational. I want to play an at-hole thing here today. Five and then this phone thing here in this new studio, something that could be the audience you never know in this town. But there's something really rotten and Denmark with this crowd. Maybe we're not capable of getting like more than one line at a time on there. Is that what it is? Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Mighty, come on. Okay, great. There we go. That's that. That's a material our audience has this week. Okay, I said I love that new aerosmith. I'm going to play the whole guy dancing beginning to end. 22, 11. This is the week in our, you see, this is what Miami does to you. This is what working in this town, Laududia. We're supposed to be all excited. We're moving off of the second floor. We're into our new studios up here with all the other losers. We're up on the third floor with a whole rest of QAM in Power 96. It's sediment. So long, we got nice new walls, newly painted, et cetera. And there's not a call on the board. Now, let's see, so far, what do we have so far? We had to guy make it up this story about the cop with the snatch out of snapshots. And then we had the guy with the boring chronic guy from Pompa and later, he was so boring. I remember what he had to say. Then we had to guy, Frankie, I'm in that check ass with his, his play is Beaton's drum. He's beating something. And then we get the medical and that's it. Four out of four. Even Joe to Maggio never was that perfect. Okay, even Jolton Joe. 5, 6, 7. I don't even know if these guy damn lines work on this phone up here. I have my doubts about this whole setup. Nice going, Eric Greg. We were in the river kicking ass. We were doing pretty good downstairs. We were doing a show every day. I have my doubts now. We're going to be able to do the Neo Rodgers show on his floor. Maybe it's being on his floor. I don't want to mention names, you know. Maybe it's like rubbing off. Something really strange going on in this outfit. 21, before 11. Yeah, my press bill. I'm wondering what the hell is this? And I realize I'm like sitting here, pressed up against a hard piece of wood. And by the way, somebody better tell a give Marine or call up Tim Russert. And tell me what I talked to his wife, Marine or the wrote the conanibook. He needs some serious instructions about glory hold before she starts writing the book about it. Put your penis under the stall. Maybe even put your penis under the stall, Marine. Just want to die. See you. They're not. I watched a wrestling match with big shoes men with sweaty cracks. They would try to grab each other's ass. There ain't nothing more than the tiny cheese draft. But when they rang the bell and the match was over, I couldn't help but notice I had a big bow now. I want a linear handler. I'm so nervous. I have a man. I brought you up around my mouth. I want a linear handler. Press your shoulder to feel the twist pushing inside and out. Why have this kissy little guy? Stick to my hand between another man's life. So when I pull my ass away, I get to sell my finger. You know, better than some time to train. You don't even have much of a brain as long as in the shower after you work out. You don't want to waste in someone's balls in your mouth. And tell that white sleeve can be messy and too smelly. That's why they like to rub that K-Y on their belly. All right. I want to be a regular and retaining more runs just like you. I want to be a regular and they be run for governor too. As long as there's a drags of crowd, I don't find going down all. Rub it. There are locks with some clumpy queer. He should have done it this week. I was talking to somebody in the airport in the MIA the day before I got on the plane and he said, you know, I listen to you all the time and you're absolutely correct about wrestlers. Even a high school in college wrestlers, every one of my never known was a flaming queen. They're the ones that are busy drilling the glory holes. By the way, got any wrestlers in his building? I've had a one-series build a drill those two glory holes down there. Two of them. Side by side, no less. I guess we're heavy do the action. 1046 and 560 WGQAM. Yeah, my my brothers need build a counter like a little bit higher like so I could rest my chin on it would have been good, huh? These people in this place, but anyway, you know, they deserve each other. Here's some rise. How are you? Yes sir. One thing about the new studio, uh, it sucks. Well, I can hear you better on hold than I'm doing when you were downstairs. Wow, Mark mostly just stuck his head in the door. I said, I'll everything up here sucks. Well, that's what he said, but I can hear it better on the when I'm on hold. Putting the PD. Yes. Uh, drummers. Um, drummers. No columns and Karen Kloppender. Karen, trapping. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I lied to him. You know something that if you would have saved the energy from the drumman and just had another sandwich or two, she might still be a drumman. It might be tapin' it. Kirk Allen, uh, you know, uh, you know, who hears about drummers? Drummers are like, uh, like I said before. And for a guy to call a tank yesterday, and this caller was just a suckle. Oh, your right. Ringo Star was very underrated. Ringo Star. Number one was a mediocre drummer at best. And number two, couldn't sing his way out of a paper bag. Number he's a bubble gum. I mean, you know, I'm sure that Hank enjoyed the concert in the group time. Runwind's rate, the drummer from a bad company said was, that's fine. But to say that Ringo Star is like a great artist is, uh, pathetic. Attequate to the task. Exactly. Right. Like like Dennis Wilson who ain't beaten it to well anymore. You know, you notice how most of the drummers are dead. Yeah, John Bonham. What does that tell you? Yeah, exactly. Uh, what about what about that Joey Bishop of the drummer for air osmith? No, no, Joey Reynolds. Yeah, come to. Uh, Kirk Allen was, you know, you're snooing about cereals on video. You know, you'd be know the Kirk Allen was super anacors. And interesting in the obit. It said that, you know, he was tight cast just like George Reeves. Once he played Superman, he couldn't get real. That's what he said, right. You know, couldn't get another goddamn role unless he was putting a have a cape on. Maybe you could have been Captain Marvel. And kiss a death, you know, right. If he would have just done that Suzanne, he could have been Captain Marvel. And I've one of the thoughts concerning when she talks about yesterday. And by the way, before you go on to then, um, it says when he was 37 he started this shows how old I am. He started as the man of steel Superman and two pictures from Columbia Superman in 1948 and Adam man versus Superman in 1950. Each was done in a 15 part cereal format. And I can remember his a kid and Rochester go to the cano theater every Saturday morning. And see in the CR and I saw those with the Kirk Allen, not that I remember who the hell he was. But I saw those excellent old fart iron. In the early days of video and when was first emerging those were one of the, one of the first things that were made available. Yeah, we're the cereal on video. But anyway, you were talking about the business about all the old people that vote on things to repress. Oh, right. It seems to me that the reason is voter apathy. All the old people are the only ones that turn out. That's right because the rest of the people down here, they take a look at the people that are offered up in what's going on. And we don't want to be involved including me. I mean, I'll I'll vote in, you know, national elections like next year. But the idea of voting in these local, these perokyo, what's the point? Exactly. Like what we use, they offer up the same direct year and then you're out. And the same income that's almost always get in with the recognizable names. And it's the same old parts in the condo is the given list. And they all go marching after the because they got nothing else to do. A lot of them they go to the clubhouse and their own condo and they vote right there. They don't even have to go off the grounds. If you don't you think if all the people that patronize these clubs and the young people like the ones that went to spring break, yeah, we're all enough to vote registered and voted. There would be more of them than the condo commandos. No. No. You don't think so. No. Because I went to vote on the library issue the other day. And the library issue? Well, you know, about the referendum to get the new library improvements? No, I don't know. Well, this is the election of the day in the local. Yeah. Whatever. But I was the only one. I think two people were there. Me and the enough for our sheriff's officer. Yeah. And this was in the middle of the day. And normally when you go to an election or to a polling place on an election day, most of the people you see there have blue hair. How and like I said, we just go to one of the circle. The rest of us are not going to care about this perofial crap down here. There's nobody to vote for. There's nobody. I mean, it's not like Chicago where you got a mayor daily or even New York where the election were not Rudy Giuliani. But we've got a mayor who means something who makes them decisions, who's got some power, who's recognized them. This is all crap down here. You got all these little municipalities. Every five blocks is another town. It's sunrise and it's water hill. And it's a pepper pines and a pepper park. And then there's the one where they won't let anybody out of the age of 100. They run an age of pepper pines. Whatever it is, they call that place. It's hopeless. Well, you know, it's amazing to me when I move down here. How similar to New Jersey, South Florida is. Yeah. It's exactly like that. I think it's like New Jersey would better weather and without the smell, right? Microfen South Carolina. And they were deaf in the town. You know, you drive out of town. You have the sub. We're going to you see trees and things. And then you get to the next town. Yeah, but I do like every hill. You cross the street. You're in another community. I like that. Ponds. You was restaurant in Cheerio Hill. Have a great day, pal. Whatever you're saying. What do you say? 567.0560. Pomp 560 on the mobile one line. plenty of open lines. Rock and roll. How a family yesterday. In fact, they just had his push on here. Thank God. I don't need breakfast. Three singers who dominated radio in 1970s were inducted to the Rock and roll. How a family yesterday along with Dusty Springfield, who died two weeks ago. Who were the three singers? Paul McCartney. He deserves to be in there, right? All right. Yeah. Billy Joel. George likes Billy Joel, by the way. And Bruce Springsteen. Absolutely correct. What kind of that come from? Did that come from like in there? Who hit that? You did. I hit. Absolutely. How do you like that? Both of the same finger. Must be getting sharper after sticking through that little hole. How do you like that? Billy Joel, Paul McCartney and Bruce Springsteen. I also inducted which for some strange reasons got way down on the bottom of the article because they're not as famous Curtis Mayfield, who already was in the halls of memory of the impressions. Now we're talking. They're like a recording artist. There's a singer. Dell Shannon. All right. Now we're talking. Now I'll go with Dell. See you later. In the gospel group to staple singers. Excellent. Blues artist Charles Brown on the Western Swing Band Bob Wheels and his Texas Playboys. We're honored as early influences. Whatever that means. And Beatles producer George Martin was a little bit of the non-performing category. How about Brian Epstein? Do you see in there? Well, see him no more. That's our topic today. Did recording artists we all loved. Dead drummers that we all they marched to a different drummer. Here's Holmes, did. Hello. Good afternoon sir. How are you? Yes sir. Good evening. Two thanks. Whatever it was. He took you to the on-hated. You know, go ahead. The guy before me was talking about the on-hold sound is much, much better. Well, they're just so if we get these people off their ass call and they could actually hear what? Yeah, they're the show. That's right. You're right. That was wrong with this audience. Right. Damn it. They hate me like poison. Oh, they heard it. No, they can't turn it off but they will not speak to me for love or money. If I gave my hundred dollars a piece yesterday and today, I still couldn't get these guy damn phones cranked up these bastards. I'll call back and you give me a hundred bucks. Okay. Okay. Jimmy also. We don't give it to him. Jimmy Olson then. Jimmy Olson, I can't remember the actors name. He was a faggot. Yeah, you know, but he was like, well, got a year, year and a half ago. Something that was thing in the paper. I think Clark Kent, you know, he kind of looked anywhere there runs around with an outfit like that. That's right. With the types and the whole thing. Right. But Jimmy Olson and the well, never mind. I know. Second thing, racing. I'm not a race fan. But a bunch of friends in my wife. People we know down downtown home. That they follow the race. NASCAR, whatever they're hell, all these races. All those crap. Yeah, all the crap. Why? They know. I don't know. But they know the names of the pit crew. Huh. The numbers of sponsors. They probably even know the name of the drummer. What? Probably. Yeah. In the breakman. But that's all I have to offer today. Who is the name of the drummer for the breakman, by the way? Okay. Thanks a lot. Now that's our, okay. Here's the poll. Which of the following is a real, I'm not talking about playing it. I'm talking about a spectator sport. Golf, auto racing, boxing. I'm talking about boxing today and wrestling. There you go. There are the four for you. That's it. That's a poll, baby. That's a spectacitor poll. Which of those four is a real spectator sport? I didn't say spectators sport. We were putting cockfighting if we did that. Which one? Golf, auto racing, boxing, boxing. Oh gee, it looked like a fake fight to be a look fist. I want my money back. See, those of you who want to keep getting suckered in, it's like people that order stuff from infomercials on TV. Asked you to do it to effigate burn the first, you know, five times, 20 times, a hundred times. You ought to get the message that, hey, maybe when you see something that's being sold on TV, it's usually a bunch of crap. Have an eye-to-earth before? The overwhelming majority of times, you buy something on from TV. It's crap, right? For whatever reason, I don't know why TV is so powerful. You think they want to be under shell and good stuff. But when you're on it, the only thing that I think I might like, because I do like George Foreman. How do you like that for Boston Upstairio Types? A boxer and he's dark-complexed too. Those who think I'm some kind of a bigot. Although, thank God we got a white basketball player. Nice going, or Miami, Ohio, Hawaii, Hawaii. Too many diseases and seasoners name them, by the way. But seriously, I love George Foreman. And I wouldn't mind having me a lean mean grill in the sheen. In fact, every time that infomercial comes on, I cannot turn it off. Have you ever seen it? You've been George's seen it. And he hates boxing, but he likes George Foreman. I mean, when you're seeing him, you don't think that George Foreman is a boxer, because he's what? 85 years old. You think of a fun guy. He's just a funny guy. You know? If the lean mean grill in the sheen, baby, and you watch all that fat drip off, and all of the feels thinner. Just looking at George Foreman with that big fat head of his, you feel thinner. Just looking at him. And then that brought on there with the cross-dies, you know, the one that's on every info. Can you imagine the money that that bitch is making? You know what I'm talking about? That's always there with Ron Poupil. And I want to talk about fake. I love the way she always says, oh, and guess who we're lucky enough to have with us today, even though he's busy busy, he spent time with us at Ron Poupil. Oh, guess what? It's his infomercial. He's peddling the crap. Okay. I hate to break the news to you, audience. It's his, he's not too busy to do the information because he's honored to make the money. Oh, are we lucky to have Ron Poupil with us today? Selling you a 20 cents of plastic, really 82 easy payments of 39.95. I'm not the rest of your life. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. Good evening. I don't mean to sound redundant, but you do sound terrific, even even even, uh, people watching. Yeah. So I just want to let you know. There's studio sucks. So for I'm sure I'll get used to it if they bring me in a hired chair. So I'm sitting with my chin up against the guy. Maybe that's why, maybe that's why, but I came in there. They said, to make keep your chin up, Neil. Well, that's what Bruce Franken and the ring of start don't get a band together anytime soon. Oh, what a thought that is. You know, they didn't even know, are there anybody in this audience had really believed that Ringo Star was a musician? Well, he had the Beatles. That was about it. But he didn't, he didn't have the Beatles. They had him. He was along for the ride. He didn't have, oh, in other words, the Beatles was his group. I noticed he wrote a lot of that music. Well, it's not. It wasn't for the Beatles. You would never even have heard of that. That's right. That's exactly right. But I want to tell you a whole question. Who's more popular? They're Kenneth Star or Ringo Star. And who's the better drummer? I think Kenneth Star. They're brothers. Are you? Yeah. They're joined at the hip. I thought Bruce Franken and some believe it would be put in the hall of the athletic. And they didn't even know it was not a singer. He's a croaker. He's a croaker. They didn't even put the E Street band in there. Just Bruce Franken because he was with the E Street band. And he put the lot of River Abandon there. Whatever the hell that was. The E Street band was little old River Band. They were more the E Street band was the actual band was more talented than he was. Right. And as far as the real spurcos, I got to tell you Neil, I would vote for professional wrestling before I would vote for boxing. Okay. Thank you, sir. We want your money, though. We want your money.

Left and gone away. And none too soon. Absolutely. And was still just as ugly as death as he was letting was a teenager. Thank you. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's a mobile and what is that? Orlando. Neil. Yes, sir. You are God. I got to tell you that. The reason I'm calling you is because I know you don't put up with media expertise. Are you ready for this? I'm going to put up with media equity. Look where I work. Well, you call with a no. You don't just let it go. And that's what I'm doing here with foxes. I need to show on Sunday, between the periods that put that pinball on, who doesn't even know how to pronounce the name of the player. They don't care about it because they're dumping it all anyway. This is their last year that getting rid of the ESPN is going to take it. And then they don't care. God, well, I'm glad to hear that because I was just going out of my F-in-mind. Which he's talking about Madano. Yeah. And all these players in just this pronounced end. Ridiculous. Thanks. You care. It's the later bite. 560, 560, pun. Yeah, I'm going to tell you one thing. I'm going to put the chair back down. I mean, that's just ridiculous. One moment please. How can I get it? Oh, I see. It's like a grand way. You have to hold it. You have to squeeze it. And the lever too. So now there's this little bit in there. You go have to a little bit better. I'm going to have to adjust the head of my chair. Nice going, Eric George. Of course, so that is not you. Here's a mobile in Miami Beach, hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. How are you doing man? All right. I hear you talking about music. And one band that I didn't hear you talk about with Kiss. Why do you think that? Yeah, because we're talking about music. Are you been around for 26 years, man? Yeah, so is cancer. All right. Lepersie's been around a lot longer than that. Okay, so I take you to you don't like that. No, I do not. No. And when they should have been involved. I don't even like Kiss Radio or sister station because I don't like those pick a music. Oh, great. I'm okay. All right. All right. That would get that. Okay. Back to you. See here we go again. They're starting this. This is what we should have stayed on for the rest of the year. Oh yeah, we should have stayed on the music things. We're right to the year because they have no other material. That's all I know from. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. I mean, we've already exposed the fact that all high school and college rest was our fag and that golf is a real pussy sport that nobody, nobody who's a real man or even a real woman watches golf. The women at watch golf are bull likes to want to watch other bull likes play golf and that balls around. And the men at watch golf are just a lifeless prosthetic sand creatures. I have no idea what how did this crowd been watching other people play golf. Oh, there's a great nine hour and look at that. Well, or any else just made the shot of a lifetime. Look at that. Now they're all slipping up the fairway. Oh, brother. And here's a mobile and tempered pine. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I know you don't want to talk about music. It's kind of before it's fun. He was right. White Clark is one of the best guitars that's not the best guitar. I'm very happy for most in the American Grave. Oh, very, very, very classical rock and roll. He can play anything but three. The man is a big ambition. That is for Roy. Well, nice going. Roy. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Five six. We're almost at the end, baby. I thought that we were only about halfway done. We're pretty close to the end of this baby. Five six, 705, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile and tempered pine. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Oh, not too good, sir. Another one. Great days. That's too bad. I just had to write up like a big, fat, tripled prune. It just dried up and died. Oh, I remember that. They're coming. American pie. The day the music died. This is a day Miami died. Well, I got you. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Go ahead. I got some interesting facts about Jean Pittney. Hmm. Yeah. I don't know if you know, but he initially was called Billy Blan. He wasn't Jean Pittney. When he first started out. Yeah. And also he was known as the Rocksville Rocket because he was from Rocksville, Connecticut. And I happened to be one of his distant cousins and I played in a high school band with him and played the trumpet. Now, it's now 1558. Did you live? Yes, he is. He is in my, he's alive and summers Connecticut. He owns a little beach beach that is open to the public. He lives a beach. Well, yeah, it's a very quiet beach. It's a small beach. It's a, it's a lake. It's a crystal lake. And he owns the beach right there and a little pavilion and they have the answers there. And, you know, I've been Connecticut. You don't have beach time too often. So it's like a seasonal thing. It goes from made up of timber and that's it. But I just thought you'd be interested in that. I enjoy your show and I live in Florida now and that means. I'm sure that's all of yours. Okay, well, thanks a lot, pal. Say hi to you. Give a big kiss for us. Okay, come at only hurts for a little while. Hey, Kennedy is up. Oh. Oh, we come in down with a little punty thing. Twenty-two. I'm right. I think how you reach out across the USA. What the corner, what's in this right here? The sky and valley who there's a bunch of squares again this year. Who says I wish to? Oh, God, there's a sea of fish. Unless there's a bunch of games. If you are, you'll want to be marching upon sin, Saturdays day. You can be above my bucket of stones. And that's okay, but you can't see a huge ship today. What the water have taken, Perrihan. Both eminence and spray. Have seen there with this pronouncement upon the blessed day. Sure, a little bit of heaven, pal. And nestled in the sea. What shall gone straight to hell for home of sexuality? Oh, God loves the A-wish. And listen for today. That was impenetraint the sight to begin the play. You can be a car, I'm not being done. God loves the A-wish. But you can't see a huge ship today. Oh, L-E-S-E-A-A. And expels lesbian. Choose an other women part of me with. From devil among him ever get a date with. Hell, E-A-A-A-A. And as we say, it's the shame that the days once a calm out and march with us. L-E-N-N. No way. But just that part of the water is short of such a straight. The foils like the tentacles and the days of the free. We won't allow L-E-S-E-A-N, the wedding of the green. And when we say up to your choice, I can... What do you mean? Oh, God loves the A-wish. As long as men are men. Perhaps the liver can't live never been short of them. You can be seen in drunk and harrel and chumps the lap of all away. But you can't see a huge ship, okay? No, just had to be a huge ship today. So I'm a 40 years in a business boy. I can grow as a number of suffering. My first radio injury. This should tell you about Greg Reed and the, uh, Beesley-Grid people, about their confidence. A bruised breast bone. That's what I got. From, uh, I, I, I, I, I lost food, son, good to me. Sounds like a major major loss of it. In fact, I'm having trouble breathing. I'll kind of problems from a bruised God damn breast bone. Because, why wouldn't they build as the same height as the one downstairs, which it was no problem with that at all? It was fine. It was just fine. I stuck up under the edge. Richard? Here's a mobile in the game. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. On the hell are you? Okay. Here's a man out of Toronto sometime in the neighborhood. You what? I'm heading out to Toronto. Yeah. You always talk about it. Do you want to visit? Yes. What do you recommend to do out there? What do you have to do out there? May they're cold? In March 16, of course it's cold. It's like 38 degrees for the height of day. And I'm not, I'm sorry, May. Oh, you may. May. Yes, sir. I won't be that bad. It'll be like it is up north in the May is what it'll be like. Like in the 50s. Maybe 60s. If you're lucky, 65, 62, 61 in the half. How's the nightlife out there? Great. A big, great, a fantastic. Great. Compared to here, spectacular. Now, I didn't have that life to day life. They after their own life to nightlife the morning life, the subway, the, uh, the, uh, you name it. Someone was telling me that they have a lot of a feeder out there and is this big as New York, but not as dirty as New York City. You right? Well, the city is no city is forming in people Toronto. Oh, okay. Yeah. And, uh, a lot of big shows up there. They have the pantages to be old, the theater up there. They got all kinds of stuff. You'll have it. So, it's a great route, which is the dollar in the Canadian money. Oh, it's fantastic. You've got a buck and a half wherever you're American dollar. You're going to buck and a half Canadian. It's a great value for Americans. Oh, I get that's what I'm adding for. All right. Have a great time. I'll be leaving right now. If I were you, you like have the loonies and the tunies. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T. Why don't you sign it? It's a real city unlike here. The real city with like a real visible downtown and a real identifiable place. Hey, hey, here it is. And we're like a part of this as opposed to here, like, you know, you know, these assholes that say, or the reason I like to live in here so much is the cultural mix. Like, like, first of all, there's anything so unusual about living in a big city that's not like all the same culturally, like there's something novel and unique about that. One of the reasons I can't stand this place is because the cultural mix is the wrong one. But the good news is, way to hear this. All these people that were psychotic about the Orioles, planning Cuba. Now, most of the people here haven't learned this yet. This is, keep this under cover. It's okay. Don't let the news out. But when the Orioles go down to Havana to play baseball down there against the Cuban National Team, they're taking about 80% of the Cubans from here in South Florida with them and they're bringing only one way to get. They're not going to back in. Yeah. I just thought, you know, don't spread the news because some people start getting panic, you know, and those Spanish language stays the van. They're starting to carry on. They're leaving and they're not coming back. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. You know how, athletes retire at a certain age when they're just getting, you know, two old, they should do that for musicians. We saw our cross on Goat Gulf Stream. Bad. That isn't even a good word. They would be the most embarrassing or really formidable performance. Oh my god. You got to know when to hang it up. You can't be an idiot like Stan Musil and keep playing like two years, three years after you should hang it up. But the highlights for me with me singing where have you got him or how I'm at our least. Yeah. I'm going to the way. More ham it. More ham it. No. Is that the right Joe? You're right. It's that. It just doesn't fit right. Can't you just play now? By the way, I'm sorry that we're back in the music, but the best two. Tony Lewis don't hang up. I'm listening. I'm listening. You're a little bit like a bar time, Genesis. And yes, bar none. No. Genesis and... No. Yes. No. Thanks Neil. No. Okay. The best band of all time, you ain't even a conference. No. You're kidding me. I can't understand. What's wrong with the music. It must be this town. There wouldn't even be a debate about this. It's like a little bit of a thing. You think we're going to work for another? What? What? It's you. You're fucking dumb. Stan is fucking dumb. You told me you were going to do that up, e. Why wouldn't youognize that team because I wanna show up all the way to London spa, that's why. And in Yacht. Young, young. No. No, I don't think I got to talk. Yeh. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, congratulations, Gennelide. I'm in the mood. God, anybody down to your own Smith is the best group all the time. Your taste is in your rectum, okay? It's way, way inside there. Like about where the Royce start growing, you know, before they pop out and get real dark purple. Oh, dark purple. We like them too. 560 and 560 and 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a Hobbsound. Hello. Hobbsound? Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, I listened to the OF couple of days. I'm new to the area. I wonder if you can take it as well as you'd give it. Which means what, sir? You have got to do it. You're new to the area, but obviously you want to give me you want to analyze my show and tell me how to do it. So, all everything that's going on here, is that it? I want to tell you where the disgusting human is going to be. Don't worry. Are you listening to it? Because I wanted to see if my hearing was that bad. Well, maybe you've got a little bit of a problem, sir. Maybe, you know, your age at your advanced age, you got a little bit of a hearing problem. No, I'm not that bad. Well, why don't you find something useful to do between these hours of 10. I think this is very useful. You have a light. I think this call is about as useful as part of going to win the storm. Okay, sir. That's how useful it is. Which you're refined to? Yeah, far that's what we're doing. So, we're going to start getting the wind storm. You want to hear it again? There's another one for it. Okay. I'm out of here, you old prune. Just what we need is another old fossil coming down here. Who's got so much to do. This guy has such an active life down here now. That he's going to take time. It's very important and instructive. Sir, I've heard from a million punks like you old punks. You know, over the age of 85, old farts like you over the years. And I'm still here going strong. Okay. And long after they stick your ass in a ground and you're got to push it up dazeys and the worms are eaten in your flesh. You're rotting, discussing, putrid flesh. I'll still be here going strong. Recognize some very serious bugs day in and day out. Okay. Long after your history. After they stick you in a ground head first. I have no line. I have no penis. I can't even stay outside. They often arm off of my chippy feet. Some to move back and back and back and back. Well, I'm just a time and lie down. Eight thousand four that were living by hand. If I were alive, I would share. I can't stand this job being crazy, so. And I blow my nose to my underwear. Take it down, the opposite hand. It probably starts with feeling sad. It takes a lot of time. Well, I just do it. I take my shoe. And it keeps you to the wall. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. I'm going to the bathroom. You're discussing your Bulgaria road test. Give a sickest piece of crap. Yeah. And what's the point? 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T. Probably plays golf this guy. Here's Fort Myers. Oh, yes sir. I used to listen to you last time you were here, which was what? Last time I was here, or you mean it for Myers? Yeah. Well, this place sucks over here. Fort Myers, you know, is. Yeah, exactly. Last guy that called, he should be over there on a west coast because he's too old even for here. You've got plenty old people here. You have been there. How long ago? How long? How long ago. Oh, my god. New of this place. Why do you have a man? In fact, the station over there, you know, the beefly station is said, well, why don't you come over here and make an appearance to some weekend and I said, No. Thank God. I mean, you know, we want to put you on a map. I want to ask with their audience or I said, no. Anyway, I remember when you were leaving the air, you kept saying, I'm fired in Fort Myers. I'm fired in Fort Myers. Yeah, that would be my career. I've never been the same since then. Thank God, I got back on. Anyway, that last song that you play by aerosmits, is that I'm the grip, get a grip, L.T. No, no, this is a live concert. It's the brand new album. This came out. It's called a little south of Sanity. Okay. The great album by the way. Anyway, on the hask, do you have the get a grip, L.T. Sure. I have every one of them. Okay. You know, I have the CD that has the nipples. Right. Okay. Of course. Someone told me that they made some of them without the nipples. No, mine has got big nipples on it. And then there's a cow that's got nipples on it. Two of these are steep toddlers I'm talking about. Right. Right. His nose around it. I want to ask you a question, where are the big nipple rings? In one picture. Yes. Why do you find that amusing? I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, the one picture that they were a lot of body jewelry, nipple rings and things, you know. Right, right, right. I want to ask you a question now. I'm originally from Michigan. I think you got a little rectum ring in one cheek too. I believe. Right. Well, I'm originally from Michigan. I was born in white pigeon Michigan. And I'm not going to white pigeon. I'm just going to say I think that means something to me. How where is that close to? It's right on the border. If you look at Michigan like a midnets on the opposite side of the thumb all the way down to the bottom. Oh, it's between the thumb and your. Right. And your rectum. Right. Well, anyway, I thought you had some radio experience on white pigeon. Maybe you don't want to do that. No, I never was on your white pigeon. I was on your insturgis. Sturgis. Sturgis Michigan. Marshall Michigan. That's why I was born. How old are you in Michigan? WALN. Right. Right. And I'm going to go to MRR. We're changing it on the ear anymore. I mentioned that now. Kellon. I then moved to the suburbion area. And I remember listening to Dick Pertn. Right. And I think you. I love Dick. Yeah. That's a. I'm not going to be a chronic or anything new. But if I can get through and stuff, I, you know, I'd like to. Well, we need some four Myers callers because we're dying over here, man. I think this this town is dead as a door nail. Well, I pretty sure. They're going to look good thing when they got it. I'm going to tell you that I'm hanging up and cigarette. That's not real. That's like the seven months I was off the year. You know, oh, gee, just I even knew times all of a sudden this cover they love me. Now, although seven months were hell. And the best thing that ever happened all last year with Neil coming back on the year. How do you like that? Although, through the way, it likes, well, snob's it new times, even. I tell you one thing that's good for this area. At least for me is this little arena they built with this minor league hockey team. Right. And then early hockey team over here too, called the Panthers. Anyway, Neil. Great talking to you. I'll have a great thing. You didn't get some of that dick on. I know you have that one dick cut with the bag. Oh, I'll work on dick. Okay. Dick, we have an open line of day two and a Howard four or three and I know what about they're all over the place. Five six seven, five sixty, five sixty and we had a woman call here today yet. So I'm self-opstanding woman callers show after that guy calls and bitches me out and cusses me out. It's just I'm the L. Anti-Colisto. Boy, you people, oh yeah, we did have a woman early, didn't we? I remember what tells she was talking about. Well, it's sent a lady in somewhere on there once, but it must have been such an unimportant call. It must have been pretty goddamn weak. Unlike these other great calls we've had today. Five six seven, five sixty, we got that Goldberg show. It's who it clocked us after the little. Hey, stop it. We got big bad bookshobbing. Six little clock and we got it. Kaplan, you can bet on a plunger brains out 10 o'clock tonight. But I see tomorrow. Hank and Boog are going to be at the Fort Laudernale Stadium. What is that for? Huh? That's good name. They're going to be. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. Oh, the Marlins at the Orioles, they're probably going to be Hank and Boog are going to be picketing out there against the Orioles trip to Cuba. Of course, I guess they have entered the rest of that story about how they're well. We don't want to keep repeating it too much. Here's Lake Worth. Hello. Lake Worth. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. You checked my hearing. I'm really old and I'm calling to find out if it still works. Yeah, how do you like that? The guy's got a weird, somebody stole his miracle here. Oh, my God. Yeah. Hey, if I wanted to listen again to see if I was hearing it right. Right, exactly. What? Now, you've been cred of for one thing. That's original excuse. Well, now you're an audiologist. You can check people's ears. There you go. You're breastbone. Yes? If it missed work, you can collect workments, com. How do you like that? I mean, I've never had a bad breastbone before. I've been old and falling apart. So I've had a bad just about everything else. But a bad breastbone? Two thirds of your paycheck stand homes, not that. Right. There you go. Okay. I've been listening since the day to day. This is my second time calling. Well, God bless you, sir. Thank you, sir. Get out of that place up there. Please, before it's too late. Well, I live up here and work in Fort Latterdale. So it's not that bad. Okay. Orner, degles, and you, too. Do you read doing well till you got to the last one? Have a great day. Oh, you, too. Woo, woo, woo. Love forner. Eagles are good. I love forner. I don't like having too many foreigners in town, but I do like forner. Okay. We got 600 open lines. Last call for phone calls today. We've had a rough two days here on a show. I'll be the first one to tell you that. I mean, a really brutal, rough, rugged two days. Which I, for the life of me, I can't figure it out. I can't figure this time. Maybe if I stayed on here here 50 years, I might start to begin to understand it. I don't think so. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Are there any women out there? Is there a woman who watches guiding light out there? Which is getting really ridiculous. This Danny and Michelle business. I mean, I love the way he grabs her around the neck. You know what I'm saying? And what he's really trying to say is, if I could have been on a show with the original Michelle who's a hot number, then maybe I wouldn't feel like strangling. If you're thinking about the fact that we're the only mafia family, how can you have only one mafia family in town? And it turns out they're Puerto Rican on top of it all, huh? Seriously. This is, this is the kind of crap that some of us watch. The soap operas, no matter how ridiculous it is, like those assholes that watch the days of our lives, which Stefano DeMira, he's a Russian Irish monster. Whatever that is, Stefano DeMira, with the Russia with a bad transylvania accent. Here's a mobile info letter there, hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. Yeah, right. I can tell you really bored about everything. Yeah. Why do you need to talk to these people? Well, I get to listen to a while and clean and pools out here all day long. Yeah. What do you think about the almond brothers from there, like first three albums, up until they're double on them? I think once they got the out of certain number of drugs, I think that was much easier for that, no? That's what you share the heroin kick in. Right, that's right. What about Jeff Beck is a guitar player? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, okay. That goes right. Yeah, he's okay. Yeah. Jeff Beck was great, yeah. Okay. How about, okay. How about going back to London pool? Get that algae out of there. Sir, before it's too late. Open lines in date, Howard Palm Beach, Key West, West Coast Fort Myers, Naples, Venice, Venice, Venecia, 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT. Oh, here's the lady in Naples. How do you like that for Jeff? How do you like that for Jeff? Hi, Neil. This is a lady. Yeah, this is a lady. It is, I just have a deep voice. Oh, I'm getting over cold. Okay. I believe you. I used to call you. I don't have to do a test. Oh, God. I used to be a flower girl over there. Anyway, do you like Steely Dan? Yeah. And you guys, up at me. And the answer was... That's my favorite Steely Dan record, drowning in a sea of pups. Oh, we got to get, see it right again. Oh, well. Yeah, okay. Nobody mentioned them so. And now you know why. I think, okay. 560, 7. Steely Dan, huh? I'd like to get that check. Whatever you got, sweetheart. I'd have somebody take a look at it. And you're throat too. 560, 560. We're going too fast with that number. Come on. Give it a little story. You might get a call or two here before between Naples or clock. All these years, all this wasted energy when I could have been talking to people that really would have, you know what I'm saying? Seriously, I could have been talking to an audience of people that really were into whatever I'm talking about. I really understood that really appreciated the really, you know, whether we're serious or humorous or disgusting or vulgar, whatever it was. You know, people that really, there was a young and a young and a, but this is, this is just talk about, that's good that we're talking about drummers. Because that's what I do five days a week here every goddamn week. Like, beading on a goddamn drum. Just banging and pounding on his phone. Yankemen on it. Here's a mobile and Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, how you doing, Neil? Great. Never been better, sir. Excellent. I can't say I'm an old fart released on a young fart. Yeah. And I can hear you just fine and I love you, show. Yeah. Tell that old guy, if he calls back with me, I don't think he can dial a phone without some assistance. He just can go back to Canada if he wants to because I'm sure they're not full. Okay. Thanks. Whatever you said. Okay. Five, six, seven. You got those numbers so far. Five, here's the way it works. You pick up that instrument, you know, with little buttons on it. Five, six, seven. Zero, five, 60. Maybe they don't get the, All right. Maybe I should be saying zero. Okay. I know some of the other shows there's a zero, five, 60. That's our pull question today, by the way. When I answer for your credit card number, do you say in zero or oh, huh? Zero or oh, huh? That's a good question. That's a kill about 30 seconds. That's good. That would be the kind of thing I would talk to San The promotion man. And by the way, tell these people is your job. I don't want to start getting pushy, but just because we have it all the other third for now. That doesn't mean we want to see them in here a lot. Do you want to say? See, I'm not into that. I know that they're very big at a schmoozing and, you know, and talk about all the boardops and the producers and the boyfriends on that morning show. But that we're having that on this show. We like being anti-social. We're here to do a job. I know that that may come especially on today. It's a shock to you that we're doing any kind of a show. And I'm not even sure myself. But that's what we're here to do. We're not here to schmooze and do, you know, I mean, George is here to schmooze when Shannon shows up, but, you know, She's in our show. Four minutes before noon, it's five, 60. You don't know about our intern that George hired by the way, huh? Why? What a knockout she had. Now she's a victor. What is she? Is she a citizen? No, how can he have a niece? I apologize, Victor. I forgot your name. I did forget his name when he came back that day. You wanted a lot because you got old and ugly. Neon God.

I'm sitting up here straight and erect as erect as I can get by advanced age. They don't care enough. I don't want to send it very best. They don't want to even hang on. Okay. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. In fact, they might start just making up Marlins games to put on a 1250 just to cut us back a little bit. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello.

You think Peter Rorella's not a goon? No. Peter Rorella? I mean, why do you consider black people a goon? Donald Bushier is he like a real skilled hockey player. He's a goon. I'm talking about guys that are fighters. Hey, was it was it was one way out of the blue bars with a fighter as you go? Is he blank? Hey, Joe Benoski with a fighter as you go?

Neil, you were talking about the hockey player. Yeah, I'm never even, I didn't even know that we had a black guy. Well, there's too many. It's like a, it's like a disease. It's spreading all over the place. There's black hockey players that even I don't know who the L.A.R. And I'm supposed to be the expert. I'm watching games every guy damn night of my life. And I'm seeing like this guy in Buffalo last night whose name is Sean Martin, John Paul Brown, something or whatever his name is, who the hell is this guy? Are they black Americans? I don't know. I don't know where the hell he's from. He's an Asian African or he's an American. I wonder what he is. Well, you know, I just really got into hockey. My life's keep your people out of the list. Victor, Victor, you got basketball. You got football. You see, the only reason now we got black guys in hockey is because this wally guy up at Miami of Ohio is a white guy. The best basketball player in college basketball in America. And now you folks are pissed off about it. So now you want to take hockey here. Neil, Neil, please. Some folks. Okay. I'm a black American. Yeah. Not an African American. That's right. That's right. You're not know after whatever the club. Neil, one more thing and it closed. You mentioned sometime ago that... Until I David J. Neil was standing over four or two while you're at it. Two till I was first and with the band added to it. I was at Wayne, I was here a couple of weeks ago and I had breakfast. Then you mentioned that... Where was he? Dead. Really? Dead. Oh, my goodness. That's exactly what we said. Oh, my God. He was a great guy. He was a great guy. There were nice people. There were the dead people. That's what God was from the serious ways. The fact that they're still around. They're still here and a B deal for you. Like us. They were closed and pleased. Neil, one more time. Car, bridges, and both. Okay. Open line and date one and brought 400 in Palm Beach a couple and four miles. One over and away and the Naples 560560, Pont 560 on the AT&T.

You go, have some little idea of what you're talking about, what you do not. You do not be know what you're talking about. Here's a mobile in Boker. Hello. Okay. There's a good one for you. Excellent. What was that? What the hell? Look at that possibly. I think that Larry Miction's foreking around with our phone again is what I think. Here's a lady mobile in Palm Beach, yellow. Hello. Yes, man. I beg you, I'd be glad to fight with two barns. I was going to wrestle with two barns. Well, I do. The guy on the Ranger, these from Nigeria. Is that why I'm saying something? Is there a bigger reason? Yeah. Yeah. Where do they have ice in Nigeria? I have no idea, but I saw him for the first time. He got the goal. He shot here from the point and the receiver was, I mean, whoever the who are they playing last night. I can't remember. I know he's going to play a lot. I'm washing it and that's where I play the cat. The name is some kind of funny thing. The whole thing was a screen on a plane. There was in the net. His name is like, G-N-G-U-M-B-E-L-O. Good, I'm Bell. Yeah, right? Toughen. Anyway, I just wanted to say Nigeria what? Exactly. Thank you. Okay. I think there's a skate on thin ice over there. 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a call in the Bahamas of all places, hello. Morning, Neil. Yeah, I'm on. I do it. Okay. A long time, which is a free time call, huh? All right. Just want to say that, we enjoyed it. Don't have a head behind me and hockey players doing. Yeah. Thank God. Nigeria, can you tell me I haven't tried it as yet? Don't do it. I agree with you. Okay. Put on thoughts. I agree with you saying we should have allowed to give the white people some of their own sports. Let them stay with hockey. Yeah, very easy out. That's right. You know, it's just a white man. You're talking about baseball, took away football, you're taking away golf, which you didn't have for my part. What do I leave out? Vanski ball baseball football. I mean, taking away everything else. Yeah. Because boys in the shows took over baseball. But Neil, notice it. Well, that's why they had to use up the baseball for Mark McGuire last year. And then of course, Sammy, so sad to jump on the bad wagon. Oh, yeah. Which is both of the above-spot-inch ball. You know? I agree. The important thing is that the black student take over the baseball. We have the spec taken over the baseball. That's right. That's right. That's right. Okay. And also that the skin. How many black skills do we have Neil? So white people are known to stick in the snow. Yeah. You know, what are you really doing? We're going to wait till we ship your ass up north. You know, all the ballers were supported. Oh. Yeah. But then you'll find out what being really freezing your ass is all about. Hey, good Neil. Yes. If we're not about those, doesn't make a signal. Have I correct? Yeah. Whatever you said. Okay. Have a great day, man. And so some good crap. 560, 505, 60, on the AT&T. Well, I was not so did Dr. Field Goods office call yet to see him was coming by this week to take my blood again. Well, he's got to. I'm going to offer. I'm putting the challenge out right now. Dr. Field Goods. See if he, you know, he called the other last week with a very embarrassing call. I think it was a week ago Friday. See if somebody really cares about my feeling health. Patching around. I mean, we're talking to, we're talking seriously a powerful drugs here. Adelaide and hydro chlorolysiside and all the change in back and forth and got to know what's going on. And here all I had was a little goddamn rash, which is mostly gone by the way. Thank you, except of course for the scar where they took the biopsie. You can't see a rash anymore, but there's a nice red scar where the biopsie was. Which hopefully might go away someday. You think it will? No. No. Not when you die, better. Here's a mobile in homestead, hello. Hey, Neil. What's going on? How are you doing? All right. You know, we were going through some papers this week in the house. You'll let the Bohemian guy resist doing this. He's going yaman. And we found a hotel bill from the embassy sweets home back to I think it was 88 or 89. Do you know what these sweets were here? Over on 33 cause. Okay. And my wife remembered that when we were staying there that we can date had a talk show convention. And I remembered a tentating to the downstairs. Yeah, that's that. The Pupid Talkers magazine, all of a sudden grandizing assholes. Yeah, that's what it was. We're gonna talk about like us in my single and that silly Alice, where I tell who's in town on the question is. How are you doing Alice? And this one woman who worked about 800 pounds, forget her name. But you know, it was that whole crowd back then. And I was thinking, then, fuck. Right. Whole crowd of self-aggrandizing egotistical jackasses. And I was thinking, this is the same magazine that listed Brook Daniels is one of the 100 most important talkers. He seems got a number so small. He tells a telescope to see it. But you know, it's interesting, you know, comparing that. And I think you were probably on FM at that time. Yeah. Why don't I know what you're talking about? Like 89, 89. I had to be 89. No, I was on I would be in those. Okay, I would be. But thing is, you survived and you'd everybody else is followed by the wayside. Yeah. She's trying to be clever, but he's still saying crap. You can't say, on the air, sir. And you kept repeating it over and over and over and over again. Why did he do that? Is he an asshole or something? Yes. 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T Wireless Line. I was broke to him by the way. And I was like, oh, I forgot to look at those trends. I looked at him at home and I get done from it. Today's my big day at the dentist, by the way. Dr. Gary over there in the pepper pine. You know, the one I'm talking about, Dr. Gary. Why? Yeah, him. Sitting need for my mouth guard. I'm going to feel this like very wet day when I get home. And I have a mouth guard, so I'm not. But I don't think I'm doing that that much anymore. You know, nobody told me that. Maybe I'm not doing it that much because my teeth are all aching and my drive. I think maybe like subconsciously, I think it's not grinding it. Of course, now the stress of these last two days. Thank God, I'm getting them out of guard today. Thank God, Jerry. Today's the day, just as an Icarotene. Because the stress from this audience went enough to kill you. But I'm still here. A lot of those old parts. You'll ever make it there, dead. They're dead. Let's hear it for those old fossils from the K18 days. And the WS News days, let's hear it. They're dead. They're rotting. They're thinking rotten, putrid flesh in a box somewhere. So disgusting that even the worms won't touch him. And it's right. Dead. So now, what's up with you, Gau from a spoko? Along with me to blow up an abortion plan, they used to kill another doctor who was murdered. And he had kids. He's with a draw and have a bad attitude. Then Brad and I can't get a gas in you. And when down to abortion, clearly dead is. Eight nothing like the smell and nurses aren't fire. Now if you drive a truck and there was smell, they had. And all the villages this will come had. And after we've made the clinic explode, we'll go find a Nigger and drag us down the road. We'll be proud you're from the South, more. No more wide, Southern pride. Now if there's a beautiful, old, and trapped inside, we'll rape her in the essence dealer first before she dies. Can they replace the Bible to the other day? Our barbarism ignorance and seeping, aint. Inbreed that is, fire up some garth Brooks to. No, we are the Christians, older low and God, who likes to wipe our ass with an old porn call. And when we're not burning church's or clinic, Bound we play our bandos in the trees with peasants in our mouth. That's what Christians require, right there in the old ground up. 131 at 5.60. We have a handover show cut up to this afternoon. So we got big, big fat. Luke Shambi, 6 to 10 at Kaplan with all the odds on games that haven't been in bed yet. 10 o'clock tonight. Marnight, we got the Marlon's exhibition game. We got the Panthers late because they're playing at San Jose. No interest in the Panthers whatsoever. Any interest? No. Anybody by nose play off tickets? No. Okay. Just checking. Here's Miami. Any other going? Okay sir. I'd like to go to the discussion we just have on the minorities in hockey. I'm not a big hockey fan, but I was wondering if there were any Hispanics in hockey. No. It's not at all. There was a guy, I can't think of his name now. He was the backup bully for Dallas at one time. His name was Mani Sumpin, brother. I think he was a Julio. Is that right? He was a really one I ever heard of. Yeah. Yeah. We need more Hispanics on the ice. No. Yeah, whatever sport we get into, you know, he put it to another level. Uh-huh. You know, it is baseball. As you were saying, Sammy Sos and the home one race. Right. That's how we are, man. Put it on another level, yeah. Just look at soccer. I mean, we're, you know, we dominate. Yeah. But that's only the dark and plucking of Hispanics.

He'll start for 20 grand here. Yeah. Yeah. God. You know, something I think there's something to do with these things on this microphone. I really do. This is the old mic. I mentioned that no mic, my son. Good. We found out yesterday the reason that everything's sad little bit on the tini side in this studio is there was a broken tweeter. Up in our, our new expensive, the craziness, the speakers on the wall. It was a broken tweeter. And maybe that's why that mic. Because now. I'm gagging. I think there's a, we ought to get to list the renaut. We can do a kill two birds with one so much love. We can spread the toilet, we can spread the toilet seed and this microphone. Because I'm, I'll be goddamn, if I'm going to take a crap on a 12, see with all these straight people on this floor. Oh, seriously, I'm not going to sit on the same 12, see the sum of those, oh, God, the thought of it. Here's a mobile. I'm going to go down to the third floor every time I have to do that. Mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Have a nice day. I'm, I'm gagging, I guess. See, there is something in here. I'm gagging on it. You can feel it like it's just like the other building, man. The corporate disease. S, S, C, told you. Law so get on the phone. See what they have to say about these cheap bastards, okay? Something really, and you know, the guy, the guy made a good point. There was talking to me about when they were doing a construction. And all the stuff when they start with a drywall, you know, and they start knocking, and that stuff gets it like as best as, only even worse, I think. Because that gets up there when the rents and it starts circulating, and you can't see it, but you sure can inhale it. Fiberglass does. Fiberglass does. Oh, my God. No wonder I'm dying over here. Major, gigantic lawsuit. Here's North Miami Beach, hello. Yes, sir. Yes. Hey, sir, thank you for the runtime lesson. All right. I'm a day late, and I'm a sureer. Yeah, as usual. I'm up to my two cents in because there's something you touched your on yesterday. I touched it, yeah. You mentioned something about the Chinese and Toronto area, right. Right. So, we was a girl. I was in Vancouver. Oh, I got in town of Chinese there. You know the reason for that? What is that? They come from Hong Kong because of British citizens, you know, with a colony. Yeah. And the car we need to come and use to took over. That's like all those island people from the Antilles that go to the Netherlands because they're like citizens. Right. And they fled to common rough nation. And that's where you are. You get the large influx in Canada. Right. See, the good thing is though in Vancouver, the ugly Chinese people all moved there and the good looking ones all went to Toronto. Oh, I got the truth. Two stories. All right. Okay. Thanks for the time. Excellent points. You're very good. Just like all those aras, those shows that we got in the Netherlands. And we're trying. Rock, rock, coke, coke, mine, coke. Rock. Seriously, you marked my words. Anybody's ever been to Amsterdam? That's not the only negative. We said the weather sucks, but we already know that going in. But other than that, everything's great, except for that, you know, those street people. Rock, rock, what do you need? Rock, coke. Now does that make me a bigot? Because I said that. It makes me a bigot. Because I just don't want to be around those people. I don't mean dark and plague to people. I mean that kind of dark and plague. If they were like and plague to people, they were hastily with the trying to pedal drugs. That would bother me almost as much. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Going once.

You've been listening to much propaganda on that morning, sure. Okay. What's the big deal? Okay. In fact, if anything, it might help a little bit. Loosen them up a little. Who the hell cares? Who gives a crap? What people ought to be concerned about is that scumbag Denise Rodman out there who, you know, has got all these personal problems whose plunging is brains out of Caesar's palace and screwing around at the casino's in Vegas. Personal problems. He can't be playing for the Lagus. That's what sports fans ought to be concerned about. That's come back. If they ought to take a couple of these off and plunged their guts of the casino, let them spread the money around a little bit. You know, I think it's hypocritical that he's suspected of player who's being laid or misled by your adult. You're right. They absolutely correct. Yes, sir. Absolutely correct. We're thinking about that coming to work this morning. You're right. Good point. Dark shows up two minutes late. You're going to sit out. You're going to ask, okay.

If you're a broadcaster, you say those words you're going to jail, you get fired. But if you're a joc, we got separate rules in America. Like I said, I think it's the grace that they're in Vegas that these young kids are gambling. He's teaching them the ways of evil, etc. Whatever makes you happy, sir, but you're right about that hypocrisy. Because Terry Murray, he's a piece of turd.

So this body has got nothing. We got plenty of nothing. That's a theme song for this town. I'm embarrassed. I thought yesterday was embarrassed. But I think that I worked for Greg Reed. That's not a lie. By the way, that's a truth. I'm embarrassed when I think about working for a man like him. But I'm even more embarrassed that I work on his radio. I work here with this crowd. George and I were discussing during one of the breaks. How much do we have that British intellectual organization? Here we're surrounded by this. This is just killing some time before we can talk about how the fight was fixed again. And about, you know, all of a sudden, bull cramp. I'm listening to Hank yesterday and Hank was at a, well, he was talking about the ringo star concert. He went to Vegas and about some of their concerts. First colleague punches up.

Yeah, well, they're tokens. Yeah, token. They've been token. But anyway, I thought, I don't really mention that or not, but, uh, Well, that's why these black, Tony. That's why they're more black hockey players popping up overnight because this walley world is walley, whatever his name is, and I'm you all back to the Xurbiac. They're very upset about the fact that the best college player in America is in the, all of the world is a white kid who's as white as the fallen snow, and they're real pissed off about that. He cost me some money on Sunday, but it's not. That's another issue. Stick with walley, baby. From now on, I will. All right. Hey, that's about it. Okay, too. So I've got the odds and those games. No, good. 10 till 2 if 5 60 and a very uplifting day. At least we got the chair straight now. Nice going George. George got my chair. This thing was a joke. It was ridiculous. And then it's counter.
