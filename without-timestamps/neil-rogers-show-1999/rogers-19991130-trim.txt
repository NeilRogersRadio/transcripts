soap there and piece of you remember little Billy you're leaning out of pizza it's gonna be a while time not the home in New York just to me sir and cheat it's like a fort I'm just like that so good I'm an old lady now I'll blow on my trumpet a little bit of a bonica and my god a little bit of a bonica without my wife now I'll live in a bonica what I see but she's got a way that's still a reed a little bit of bonica what I need a little bit of bonica and more ye a little bit of bonica here I am a little bit of you I'm a happy man loving a fucking five six you've got to two I've got hecked

basketball Beth Koon cookman and my me heracunes and then it capital after the basketball game so we got a heavy duty schedule tonight anybody interested in the u.m. heracunes oh basketball game come on let's get with it of course you'd be able to watch a lot of this stuff now we better fight out because this release again says almost immediately top salad a satellite company's began offering local ABC CBS NBC and five-channel in some of the largest markets better fight out of some of the independence are also going to be on there because before anybody decides to make the big switch like if they're obsessed with channel 33 39 23 51 whammy got forbid like a guy wants to watch the a heat games once in we were which I don't know what he's worried about because if he's got the illegal card he can watch the heat game on the NBA package you're all on there aren't there those are the ones from a sunshine well whatever they were five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line here's my big yellow yes sir you remember i've got a head on TV from years ago was called the summer racing at yacres it was on the sunshine or something like that it was called what the summer racing on the summer racing at yacres what about it was on for like an hour you remember that you used to have the card that seems like yeah why couldn't you have a show like that would use a moderator from pomp and all on a Friday or third don't think here's that line of hello hey yeah yes sir i got a walk in a people on the age of hundreds sir harness racing is abandoned anybody over the under the age of a hundred go ahead sir i'm sorry i've got a big one a little one and a nacoirn size one and uh... i'll read that i think that for me from direct TV's website they're saying that it's going to be five ninety nine for your four network affiliates so whatever that may be for your four network affiliates what about the other where local independence states well that's what they're saying on the website right now they don't mention anything about love and local affiliates and also always people that you know all the time about yeah you know they complain they can't uh... see direct TV in their other rooms well for a hundred bucks you can buy a modulator you put the signal on whenever channel you want you can watch it on a TV now wait a minute but you know the way how how do you watch different channels in different sets well like i got the big dish and a little dish so i have never different uh... but i've got a modulator it'll take both signals put around two different channels and you can watch simultaneously okay we're straight where do you get that like a radio show now you got to order it from you know to place it specializes in satellite products okay okay okay i think that's it thanks so before we get to excited about this and i was really with that to a friends you about it and i'm just a little less because i don't really care do i need to see whammy no no do i need to see channel 33 ever again no or 39 no 23 or 51 no never in fact i would be a bonus to me if i never did see 23 or 51 i can watch subroad you got the end of big dish i can watch the big one on the big dish want to see the little one turn on a little dish five six seven oh what happened to that call from Atlanta two bad we're paying for it and here to me like it i did which one was the guy just now big dish little dish say corn that was the guy from Atlanta it's got an acorn Jesus Christ i'll link his ass here's North Lauderdale hello hey no yes sir hey done okay i hit the put a damproint oh hey we want to hear the end for the correct information okay the correct information is you work for the cable company no no i'm gonna satellite business i'm off for satellite no okay i'll give any misinformation but the truth is the truth okay right first of all dish network has had local channels for a year already how can they do that they've had in the 13 biggest markets in the United States of which my am using included dish network has been broadcasting the four major network affiliates at each of those 13 cities available only in those areas four almost a year directly we will be doing the same thing i think i'm like the top 50 some markets i don't know if the top 50 are gonna be ready the top 20 within the point okay but again it's only the four fox ABCCSM you see it's only the four network affiliates in each of these cities it's not actually there will be no independent channels down the road who knows but i mean you know you got to be no mr. directivita to get the answer to that but i mean that this this is what this network's been doing for a year already and this is what you're doing here so that we're good if done that i meant i i find it hard to believe no it's it's been a game it's been precluded by a long other have been able to do satellite companies have been allowed to here in little bit to go to additional or website they had the third the 13 top US markets of which my am using included have been they've been up and running a top what did they just gain i have no idea i have no idea well one of the co-appacans along with directivita was echo star which is this tv right they have the little one of the accomplices they've been up and running maybe maybe there was litigation that was going to prevent them from keeping them up there and this is now now this is the answer for them that they could they definitely can keep them but they've had them up there for a year like Dallas Miami LA New York the major major cities and for people who live in david and ponderies county still the best thing is just get a local TV internet it's not a big deal right you know i'm gonna satellite business and most of our customers we put up we we install satellite system friendly clip the cable and we put up a local TV internet for them also and then you get all your regular channels and you don't pay for them yeah and people i want to get all the u.a. chef selling i mean even just an inside u.a. chef and ten of the depending of where you live you have only six nine is tough though yeah 69 i don't know what they're using for a tower over there but it definitely definitely definitely yeah it sucks all right okay thanks thank them okay anybody know what he just said oh okay she don't have this TV and i just not that i want to doubt his word because he sounds like a reasonable guy he's a satellite guy but are we sure what he just said oh about the this TV had it well we give a lot of good misinformation out here they just like we did that they we talked about computers and put everybody to a common including me that they well i'm still sorry about that almost as sorry as and the day that i wasted my whole life for Gary Sardier today speaking of computers thanks a lot Gary you jackass oh what i went to yesterday with the tech people and the support people and click in this and click in that and the doing this and call in a cell phone and one ear and a portable phone and the other ear and a computer oh my god you're out here would have already for Christ's sake okay i sure like mine's bring out to that nobody what are you torturing about in there i do i've used them for two years i'd like them i have no problems with them i endorsed them in enthusiastically and heartily and i will continue paying if i have to pay for their service i have no problem for that with that i'd like them a lot matea there you go we like mine's pretty scary Gary five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line mobile in Miami hello hey new hi doing pretty good sir i i gave up on cable about six months ago yeah i mean it was terrible so what i did was i bought uh about the satellite dish and along with it i got a little antenna that mounts right on to the ditch is about fifty dollars right and i get all the local channels including the independence oh you got a little bit oh you do it just switch from three to your local channel you particular local channel right you get your dish your your satellite stuff on channel three and they're all the other stuff comes in on the channel right correct then it's only forty nine dollars at brand smart and uh you don't have to deal with uh any kind of additional charges to get your local channels and i'm plenty of people by the way her pain more than forty nine dollars if they get HP or this stuff like that it pain more than forty nine bucks a month to the cable just for one month correct right so this works out really well in the reception is fine i mean i know there's no problem at all with it so i'll use it it's just for the news and so forth and then i watch all my programming on the satellite yeah well let's hope that uh by another six or seven months that only a small handful of best-read people i'll be the one left with the cable oh exact the worst in fact the problem it'll probably become a social thing if people want even admit that they've got it anymore yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay pal alright thanks for the good news there's a guy who got smart on time ago just say goodbye to the cable except that one guy on west book who loves it all for your cable and probably works with the company five six seven five six they pound five six on the eighteen two i will get to the bottom of all this and i can't say it for really is that would be let's see four six seven and ten what else do i need why need those you like to have channel oh which i can get it with a god damn uh with the one of those little uxf circular antennas with a circle jerk no problem at all but i don't need to ever see them again especially when you got seventy five thousand other channels on your god damn satellite dish this is what i don't understand i don't get it i just don't get it ten past eleven and five sixty double one there's just a lot of free in your or it's the same people even a live screen that want to have the cable or just or don't even want to go to the in-capital just want to watch their local channels that's all away

said job, sing The Florida is falling It was a parking lot Early first and those parts so fucking You said really sweet that I don't care I don't care Whatever happens to all that could be to have Nobody gives a crap in this control Fight the battle, kick the land of the great dead So I swear to swear my balls instead I don't care I don't care I don't care I don't care At 5.60 WTA, here's some more info that there are facts And we know from the satellites thing It says once they start offering the local channels satellite TV producers Provider's will have six months to hammer out required retransmission Remains with the networks by 2002 Companies that carry any local broadcast stations in Mark will have to carry all of them By 2002 So obviously there'll be phasing in the other independent networks Probably you know like she said on the thing that I played The most popular that the networks that the independence that have any audience They're going to be the ones that they're going to be putting on first In 2002 they'll have to have all of them on there Analyst said the law will open new doors for satellite companies Which were losing customers and wanted local channels This is a big sigh really for the industry Said direct vain of Paul Kagan associates in Karmel, California And the major market certainly cable is going to have much stronger competition Local channels will cost $5.99 a month on top of the other services customers select 5.6 bucks a month 6 bucks a month, direct TV satellite packet is started 14.99 the average subscriber spent about 58 bucks a month They said but that figure also includes paid for view movies and televised events And things like HBO services that you pay for register Sporting a package is et cetera 6 bucks a month As opposed to the 38 bucks a month You pay an S.W.I.P. and need you one now For cable what do you pay? 35.35 to 40 bucks a month 6 bucks a month for the local network affiliates Crystal clear picture And you get 8 million other services that are available on the cable besides for your You're a basic package For less than what you're paying the cable Plus the opportunity to buy how many are there? 100 on the pay channels? 102 to 100 is 100 pay per view movies Plus all your HBO and cinematics and show time and whatever the other one is Movie channel And then all your sports packages And then it's locked a guy should be between the quality of the picture and the available programming It's locked a difference between day and night Here's Margie, hello Neil Yes sir Hey, how you doing?

Is it $38 is it $35. That's what people Can relate to. Not the some tax and the nail tax and the guy damn whatever All the back. Yeah. But they'll buy by having the dish. I'll Okay. Thank you. And the hip bone connected to the back bone. Right here. That's right. Thank you. Why do you take something that is pretty simple. Pretty basic that even a child can understand it. And only the people in this town Can make it so guy that complicated. You just want to pick God damn cotton or Something like that or pick seeds out of your. I can answer something. Jesus. Quite foul. I just get through Tell them nobody cares about that. All they wanted to Is tell me how much is it going to cost me. Well, let it go. I'm paying Now and how am I going to get what do I have the opportunity to get? That's what People can relate to. Not as it's done. And then it will be like saying, Well, you're looking to look at your FB and elbow. You're paying so much for Nobody cares. Nobody cares. They just want to know and dollars and cents when They walk into a store to buy a television set. They don't want to fight Out how much is for the condenser and how much is for the picture to and how Much is for the guy damn those big tubes that they don't make anymore. How much is it for all of that? They don't care about those things. They just What's the price of this unique? That's what they want to know. Do you understand Sir? I didn't think so. I'm telling you, it just it takes the life Outer me to try to the wonder. I said here in big for call. I'm just not on the Way of like with these people. We I don't know what people. I'm on a way of Like, but I'm not on the way like with these people. It's like the people that go in four people, two couples go into a restaurant. They order a meal. They sit down and then they take the check and they got A dissect. They got a dissect and they got a divide and they got a they Drive up their inner goddamn Jew can know when your guy damn Cotton knelt or their big reveal. And then they sit there for a half an hour Dividing and arguing and punching around how much do I owe and how much is for The tax and for the tips and then it's that when so on. That's what this guy reminds me of the same the same crap. You understand what I'm saying? Yeah. I knew you would. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yeah, okay. Look, thank you for mentioning the channel 23 and 51 Patents Spanish and I do the reason that I also put my dish was because I'm able to get a channel from all the countries like Central American South America with a dish with more dish. Yeah, yes. Yeah. No, you're not. Yeah. No, you're not. Yeah, yeah. Like what? What's happening? You're getting in the small dish from Central America? For example, I get a channel from Chile and it's the channel called Swirl and with that channel you your south through Swirl would love. Yeah. And then with that channel you can what would you get that? Well, from what service do you have? What do you have? This is not all additional work. Well, that's a common Easter. or a common Easter I know that. Yeah, and this is a special, and this is a special antenna that comes with a two-ohm and these. And telling you, it's a great dish. And by the way, if you need a legal car, I can get it for you. No, no, no thanks. Nothing. We're tracing the call. See you, bit her hang up. Come on, Easter. Five, six, seven. There are probably, he knows Kadell too. But out by the way, it's coming to town this weekend. Now, he don't want to go to Seattle, because they're looking for him there, but he's going to come here instead. We'll be safe. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T Wireless Line. Maybe he's going to looys in the Bronx. Here's a mobile-in-pombee, Cholo. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Great. I called. I'm, I've had direct TV now for about a year, and I've been waiting trying to get local channels, or any of the net. Well, here's your day, sir. I don't know. At the moment. What? No, listen. No, I can't. I called last night. I got heard of keys grow. They slow down a little bit. Oh, this one... Hey, sir. They want to just slow down a really slow produced accounts. They want to slow down a less, crazy hedgehog. They want to slow down a little bit with that helps. Still before they sort out yet, Mr. Cool. And, yeah. Well, we could sign right here, yeah. And that's lower than Saf Keith. Okay. That's less than the major каких-aging career. Yeah, though. Yeah. I mean, I want to go through, yeah, and they still try to go to the Nestou Live. The Localitals, right here, they go with that percentage of police. But I'm not in the Miami-ADI all either. West Palm Beach, they said it could be 68 months. But I used to be able to pay $6 or $8, and I could get ABC and VCCBS from East and West Coast. And then they turned it off on me about a year ago, and I thought what just new legislation that they were going to react at, but basically what the direct TV guy told me last night was, don't you know anybody in data and Broward? I went to all three networks up here and asked for a situation. Do you know anybody in data and Broward? You have to lie. You have to be creative. You have to tell them you live in Broward. They can't tell where you live. Don't you understand? Call them up and tell them you moved and give the address of a friend of yours. And that's the way you do it. Because all they do is you have a card in your unit. So I'm sure you've got a card. But also you've also got all your numbers. Nothing to me. Just do what I tell you. Just lie. I'll try to lie, but they also know just what number is because the boxes are hooked to your phone line. Yeah. So I mean, you can tell them that you live in plantation or whatever, and you can't get a signal, but they also know that if you're, they know the phone number because each one of your receivers is hooked to a phone line. They know your area, code in your first three prefects. So I'm just telling you that what a lot of people believe happened with this new legislation did not happen and we're still under the grasp of the law. You and Pompeo, you're not on the grasp of anything, sure. This is the change in law, okay. If you live in a market, date, county, Broward, county to Miami, market, you're all living to Miami markets and you're not smart enough to lie to you. What are you going to argue with me about it for half an hour? Which I don't want to do. What is it not given the appropriate answer just why? Why? Look what time it is already. Three minutes I wasted with that because you won't listen to me. You have to be creative, sure. You have to have a little ingenuity, which obviously you don't. Hey, Captain, no scores. Learning a hand, so the last came in. Oh, we have a fourth radio 560QAF. Floridian, dumb-eyed dirt. Peter home. Yeah, if you know home. Yes, uh-huh. If you know the director there, I could talk to you. Yes, a moment. Thank you. Hello, this is Pradel. May I help you? Hi, let me ask you something. Sure. What's the best way to commit suicide if you don't want to mess up the corpse? Oh, we'd have to be some kind of a drug or an alien. Is that it? The aliens often turn him a cherry red, so you almost have to go with the drug. Okay, because I'm thinking to kill myself. And my mom, I know she's not going to want to bury a corpse with his brains all blowed out. Well, that's pretty final step. Yeah, you'll see me in there. That's a pretty final step. I'm the one with a Guar Tattoo and the Pantera Tattoo. They're my favorite bands. They're the only ones that love me. Oh, really? You'll see me. Yeah. Thanks for the advice. I'm going to kill myself like that. Well, thank you. Just make sure you use the right ones. Otherwise, you might really put yourself into some thick positions. So what should I use to kill myself? Well, you're going to have to use something that's strong enough that it's going to do it even after you're going to go ahead. Okay. I give you an example. I'll make sure I get it. Unfortunately, prescription for most of all of those. Dad says only freaky people play with dead bodies. Do they? My daddy, are you freaky? Yeah. That got a freaky. No, well, you'll see my firm young naked body. Thanks for the advice. I'm out of kill myself. Creepy. Okay. Bye-bye. 26 till noon. I'm quite very coincident to that. I play that right there. Oh, not just to go into the time. Ready right now. Wow. And to show you just how sharp this audience is, how on top of this issue they are. This was just facts. To me, dish network started this deal. Beaming the local channels yesterday. To 13 selected cities around a country beaming ADC, CBS, NBC, and Fox local affiliates. And guess what the 13 markets are? It started yesterday. It's on right now on this TV. For four night down a month, by the way. Not five night down like the rectivey, four night and nine a month. New York Los Angeles Chicago San Francisco Boston Washington, DC Dallas, Fort Worth, Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix Denver Pittsburgh, and Salt Lake City. Not pond-based, loser. Sorry. But is he won for my life? Why is winding and winding and what? I'm sorry. I don't live in Palm Beach. I'm not snooty enough to live in Palm Beach. Okay. I'm very sorry, sir. So, in fact, I'm very happy I don't live in Palm Beach with all those blue noses and brown asses up there. I'm not interested. Oh, well, the government is doing this to us again. And they can see if you had a brain and stop being such a hard ass. You learn how to lie. You then, of course, if you had a friend anywhere in the world, you had an address at a time. And you could have had the east and the west feeds already on the network. Like anybody else with a brain could do. But you obviously don't have any friends. Even in Palm Beach, much less out of town. It says this network now gives consumers a real alternative to the rising rates and forecast and the service of cable TV. Echo star also plans to offer independent network channels in some markets along with the network affiliates and the national PBS feed. To find out how you can get your local channels along with hundreds of channels, a popular satellite TV program visit www.dishnetwork.com or call 1-800-333-3-Dish. There you go. So it sounds to me like maybe Dishnetwork is even better. All the other one of Dishnetwork is about all the sports packages. And I asked about an hour ago, if somebody would tell us about that and they tell us, oh, no, all I give us is a big cock and bolstery about how a 4-4 year now you can get the local channels on Dish TV. When you can get them as a VES today, okay? Because waiting for the audience to pass along some information, you can wait until God didn't help for his over. And whatever that guy was talking about, people in Central America. And we're a Kibo. 5-6-705-60, 55-60, on the AT&T Wireless line, as we continue putting our lips together and going, okay? Okay. We'll remember like that. Coming here in the morning, all whipped up the first thing I see is some God damn good news finally. And it's not even noon yet. They've already got to pull on our hair out, by the roots. Here's Davy, hello. Mr. Rogers. Yes, sir. I, I used to sell direct TV before that I sold prime star. I've worked with the Kibo companies right now. Oh, I'm so sorry. Problems. Any problems that you have or questions that you have, I think I can answer them. Problems with what? First of all, I heard the Spanish guys talking about the International Station she was getting. Yeah. That is available on Direct TV. It is. They have a system in Miami, only. Only city Miami called Paratotos. And you get all of that. That's all of the space. That one. Yeah. Yeah. That was fantastic. But you also get an HD radio system. I don't want that either. I'm not going to go spend 10 grand for a TV set. You're not going to get a HD TV? No, I'm not. OK. I'm going to go on from this country before I get one of those. Now you're friend up in a Wellington who was saying he didn't get local stations up there. Yeah. Not going to be available in Palm Beach. Good. It's only available in date and brow. Good. Because I started. I'm delighted. I'm the ecstatic here that I will be never gets the channel. We're doing major markets first. Right. And you know, Palm Beach. I'm going to be doing 100. That's right. So they don't get a candidate when New York is going to get a before Palm Beach. I'm here. And what I do they want to get. Right. Good. The local stations are. That is that heard all week. They are available on this small dish. It's just a matter of technically how they're going to get them operating before December 31st because they're deadline in December 31st. But they don't have a hard date when they're going to put the locals. Now, who are you talking about day? Direct TV. Direct TV is already saying early December. They're going to have a Maya. Yeah. But yeah. That's not going to probably happen. It's going to be probably before the New York hit. Because they always say something and then later on it doesn't have. No, they're already on the New York and LA. I know, but I'm talking about that here. No, but we had the guy called before who's got the illegal card who's watching. Who's got access to all the 900 channels. He's got a prior to the card. I'm talking about people who pay for it. No, but a little bit easier you're not listening to me. Okay. And I'm trying to make you was that the local affiliates, the local Miami network affiliates, already already on 900 channels up there. They're already there. Yes. Yes. All they have to do is give people access to them. That's right. That's what I'm just saying. I don't know when that's going to happen. Well, it's going to happen early December. I mean, if you have me, they're certainly not going to go on to a lie about what they're alive. They might just say they missed their deadline. No, I don't think so. Now, for the independent stations like, Miami, they're not going to be able to do it. It's only that we're going to lie. There you go. Barry, do you faggot? Sir, is it right? I'm sorry. It's only a local affiliates. They're about win. Those who want to win to Congress and lobby. And yeah, but let me say it again. It says by 2002, they will have to carry all the channels, all the local channels in any market that they carry channels in. That's correct. Yes. That's correct. So, that's right. That's right. We can live without my whammy for two years. Maybe they'll actually have something on, if I 2002, somebody might want to watch all the way down. But maybe you never know. Right. Thanks. OK. Because the picture gets a little cloudy here and cloudy here. I thought we were clear in the picture up as a clear like reach right in there and touch. And this guy wants to talk to me about HDTV. Do I want HDTV? No. Is there more than like five shows available? They need programming anyway? Oh, hey, let's one by a pretend grad at HDTV. He said, look, great. We're going to impress if it's called in all the neighbors. Sit around for 20 or 30 hours. Wait and for a show to come on at today's HDTV. On a channel, by the way, that's telecasted in HDTV. Oh, my God. 24 noon is 5. 60 W to QA. I'm going to go back home in the sit there for my computer. Yeah, go and move in with like that. Say, Gary, sorry, Sammy. Yeah, okay. Get through. So help me with those people call me today. I will come on the year here tomorrow and do such a tirade. I will mention their name. I'm serious. I don't want to be bothered with them anymore. The answer is just, oh, leave me alone. Here's a gaggy stock. OK. OK. Hey, there's a quiz. Drinkers, round on quiz. Drinkers. He has a house and garden. I would love to see what happens. He just holds and passes by me. When in calls, they can look real from deep sea. So where is this place? And now's what they do. He's on sea and he. Jo! He's his son. Where's he? He's here. Or all the creatures meet. Hi. What's your life here? Is there? He's that so I could just find. He's a human. He's a human. He's a human. He's a human. Come on, come on. Come on. Come on. He lives on clear streets. Think you're the round on the queen. He's three. He had that house and that house. 14 till noon at 5.60 WKOM. We're trying to straighten this whole thing out. OK. I'm so glad that I brought this up. Aren't I about to bring something up like this? It turns into a nightmare. You try and start out with the best of intentions. Here's some good news. Most people don't know about this yet. A lot of people have been waiting for it and it turns out into one nightmare. 5. 6. 7. 5. Just remember the old thousands of years ago. They had all those fables. All of your thought process. It all those bubble mice. Just listen to these people. One after another. Here we are. Almost the end of this century. Allegedly. Even though we got another year to go. Here's four miles. How's it going? OK. She's been ages since you played that song. There you are. Yeah. I was thinking I was wondering if that song was talking about Richard Gear. Anyway. I didn't look at your show yesterday. So I really don't know what was going on. I did catch the initial part. Yeah. It's for when you're talking about the weed. But then I turned off after that because I had to go to work. I was wondering. But any chance. Would you be John? Don't think the dolphins have a shot. 560505060. 560 on the AT&T line. I won't give the out of town. I'm going to give another call like that. Here's a pay phone and dear field. Hello. Hey, Neil. How are we going? A couple of things about the dish. I've had the dish for a couple of years now. About a year ago they shut off. It wasn't the local stations. But I had the network package. Which was the two ABCs, two CVS and the five. So I just didn't know if you were aware of that. This was available down here for about a year and a half and they just recently turned it off. Yeah. Okay. I want to let you know. But people you folks keep bringing up all these spurious things and all it does is confuse people out there who don't know what that's all about. It isn't relevant to this in any way shape or form. Okay. This is not relevant. This is relevant. The only thing that's relevant is that here's an opportunity to say goodbye to your cable company. That's the most important thing. Favorite is to give yourself a billion more choices to see a thousand times more programming and pay maybe very little more, maybe not even anymore, and the second bite of cable. Okay. One more thing I want to tell you. Yes? I know they tell you you have to have your phone line plugged in for the satellite. No, you don't. I know. That's only if you want to do paper view. But you don't need a paper view. What it does is it stores up on the card. That's how they find out if you order paper view movies and the sports packages. If you don't have it hooked up, you still get your paper views. It's just they can't believe for them. I had the dish at an apartment and you have the card in it. I didn't have the phone line hooked up not even for a second. The whole time I lived at that department. I got the NHL package, the football package. I ordered 25 paper view movies. I didn't get a single bell. Did you ever get out of the house? You ever get out? No. No. He was most into what I just said before. Just keep confusing and confusing and pouring more. These people must work for the cable company that are calling us today. Just try to confuse everybody else. Throw enough crap up in here and everybody's gone, ah, ah, this is too much for me. Very simple. There's nothing complicated about it at all. Five, six. And all these people that are illegal cards and all the other crap do what you want to do. Okay. Go to jail. We'll send your flowers. We'll send your card every few months. Whatever you want to do, that's up to you. That's not what we're talking about here today. Like all you ask holes with your guy named illegal cable stuff. You know, all your illegal cable boxes. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line. And maybe we might just get interesting call on that out of town line. We actually had several good calls for over there. But now those people are all in a, that's it. Now we're getting calls like the guy with Jimmy's got a shot. I mean, what is that? What is that, sir? Is that a phone call? Is that your material? Is that your contribution to the human race? Jesus, cake. How many of you are there? What is that? What is that? What is that? What is that, sir? Is that a phone call? Is that your material? Is that your contribution to the human race? Jesus, cake, Christ. And his chronic mic down here in Kendall, Jesus, Mike, get a life. Get a life. Upon moving out my parents left me their direct TV satellite receiver. I tried to obtain service under my name, but to my disappointment, the cards inside the receiver are now, non-transformable order to obtain service. I'd have to order a new card and pay, blah, blah, blah. Why does he have to change the name? Does the rect TV know that his parents moved out? What is wrong with you like? Like the guy up there in Palm Beach who's belly-yicking and crying, because he's too stupid to lie a little bit. I called me the one our local cable provider, quite a service to them. Let's just mention that I get 100 channels. Besides, much of the rect TV's programming has to be ordered to the remote to hold the dish. Mike, you're full of crap and you're stupid. You're stupid, Mike. Call them up and have to put it in his own name. Why couldn't you lie? Why couldn't you say this is Mike's dad? Whatever your dad's name is, this is a blowfish. That's right, it's supposed to be his son, Mikefish. This is blowfish. Yeah. This is Mr. Pike. Pike with a peen, that would okay with a peen. Jesus, Mike. No wonder he's busy faxing us all day morning noon and night. How would the dish, the cable's ready, gets a hundred channels. How many of those channels on a cable do you watch, Mike? I like the one where they're always operating on animals, okay? That's my favorite one. See, when people know nothing about something, then they become dangerous. Then they're really experts. There's more entertainment on the small dish and a better picture in any five minutes of your life. Then in the next 50 years of your cable, okay, Mike? But again, because he was too stupid, just to lie a little bit and keep it in mommy or daddy's name. And then he wouldn't have had to change the cards and pay another 90 bucks or whatever. And by the way, if you can't afford to pay the extra 90 bucks to get the goddamn cards, how can you afford to be faxing us 50 times a day? Do you know what I'm saying? How few did afford to be doing that? Why isn't he working his ass off scramming to make a living if he can't afford to pay 90. 90 dollars for the card? Even George could afford to do it. Of course he probably was going to get an legal one, but nevertheless, if I get my bonus. Yeah, there he is. George, if he ever got his bonus, he could afford to pay the 90 dollars, but he can't get his bonus. Because we're in a quiet period. I'm sorry. Well, no, wait for that thing to go through, which I can't talk about. Here's Boeton, be chill out. Yeah, hey, Neil. I got the dish network that I forgot about a year now. Are the local channels on, Nosser? Well, I don't subscribe to the local channels, but I wanted to tell you, you've got it. Well, you're available right now. It says it in the release that they were available in Miami as of yesterday. I haven't even checked because I can't get rid of my cable, even if I wanted to. Why not? I live in a community where cable is part of the association do's. Oh, what kind of a rip off is that? It's a big rip off, so I have the satellite dish, and I also pay for cable. Oh, I don't have a choice. What a scan that is. Yeah. But in any case, you want to know about the sports packages on this TV. Right. Okay. There's no major league professional sports. You can get the top. See, that's what I thought. That's why I couldn't get this TV. Who else wants that? Well, you can get the college game plan for football and the college full court basketball. You can get English premier soccer. What's the number? You can get cricket and you can get rugby. And rugby. And of course, all the WWF stuff. All right. There you go. What? Now, how about lacrosse? I don't know about lacrosse or tidly wings. But I actually enjoy a dish TV. I'm for me. They're expanding to 500 channels in the available now. Yeah, but no, no, no, professional sports. No real sports. No real sports. I'm thinking about getting a second satellite. There's so I can just get the packages. There you go. That's all you have to do. Thanks. Have a great day. Okay. Thanks for the good news. There you go. He's stuck because he's in one of those easy with the condo commandos. And he's got a paper to cable. What do he's got it or not? Well, they watch his or not. Or they'll come and take put his teeth in back into glass. Whether they're false or not. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,<|th|>, 5, 60 on the April. You four pastures up there. Feel so bad. I feel so bad for the people out there who are so deep pride in the brave and don't even know what they're missing. Including the sports nerds. This is your sports nerds station. Like I said, the people who work on these sports shows on his station. You ought to be screaming for people to help a couple of this. So they can finally start finding out what else going on in a real world. Besides the stupid goddamn local games we got here. You know what I'm talking about? Like real announcers and real God. And real fans. They're like real cities. I'm all for Harold from the front of the desk down. Of course it's back to the point that Harold got a prize. This is fucking tough. Yeah. Oh, you got it. Harold. So we found to give police the two one way. Oh, you know, you need to know is Yanick Perol. Now what the Jackie Least is saying. I don't think like that. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60,<|th|>, 5, 60 on the AT&T line. Oh, I'm telling you, I'm just I'm ready for lunch. What do you laugh at a book? Let's get Tony's in here. What? Do you think that just does a couple of little pieces of Atlantic cities. Sub this morning which we appreciate very much by the way. But you think that that was enough for today? No, no. I'm starving. If I told you what I ate last night while I spent the three hours in that computer. Do I dare tell you? I went to publics. I've got a half a gallon. Of Heath. One hour of healthy choice. Rocky Road. All these two is healthy choice. And see what I was going to do. What I usually do is I'll eat like, you know, small, but I'm going to amount a bit. And then I, what I do is take water and I put it right on that. It's true because otherwise if I keep it, I'll eat it. But instead because I was a captive audience sitting there in front of the computer. Would it's kind of phone, how can you try to, would myself own and one year or the other thing in my other ear and my hand and my back go instead. So what do I do? It's holding. No, not quite. Not quite. It's not as well. A lot. It's 11.57 at 5.60. Nobody can. It's pretty good too, by the way. Hey, if you're one of those people like me on the Atkins diet, every known in, run the Hell or die right at the other. Zade Zillion, low carbohydrate diets. Please do yourself a favor and get to know my friends over at the lights of West Fishelackens, retail, cinnamon, South Florida. It's an entire store dedicated only to low carbohydrate product. And by the way, you know the RC colleague we're talking about. Gotta hold a bunch of it at the public's yesterday and it's got, it doesn't have sacrum. It doesn't have a different type of sacrum. It's got splendor. Splendid. Which also you can buy by the way. The packets at the lights. They carry that. We're buying it all those instead of diet. Which unlike sacrum, it won't be cancer and unlike acpertim, won't give you the Hebys, or whatever acpertim gives you. The hebys, you'll start saying, oh, you do not hebys. Only one stop Florida radio station has a hammer. No, no, no, no. Hey, don't do it. We can happen in the two sports radio 560, you a- No, you a- My honey is hot today. The Georgie bush said that his nose is clean and never puts up it. Hatching running for the White House, so he just converted me to. Don't drunken that fat all even down a few feet ball. How many can he drug with you? He even drugged some medicine too. Why will George just come out and simply say he did it? He prefers the drugs with shock them out. So it's not here God damn it, sir. He did more than what you think. But he watched it as a thing. And he prefer cocaine to have. Let's question that he does. And he made it quite much clearer. Like a laser on a mirror. But he wants the two beys. That he didn't do anything. George, he pushed his head in the middle clean and never put up it. He can't be running for the White House. He just asked him to do it. George, he's pretty, George, he's pretty. All right. Come out to it 560 W2AM. 16,000 open lines here today. I came on a year all excited and through the about this ticket. I passed along some really valuable important information. Exciting information just say goodbye to the cable company for years. Now, I've been hearing a bitching and moaning and carrying on the cable company. The picture goes out to the quality of the pictures sucks. The price keeps going up. The services garbage. You can't get through them for a lot more money. Yada, yada, yada, yada. Here's a great opportunity for his billions and trillions of people from coast to coast in this country to say goodbye to the cable people forever. And what are we getting here today? Blin, blin, blin, blin, blin, blin, blin, blin, blin, blin. Like that. We know whatever I knew at 10 o'clock this morning. Whatever I knew. I now know 400 percent less than what I knew at 10 o'clock. As usual. As usual. It's the old misinformation game. A lot of her beads a lot of words. It's like the sports call then it's radio stations. A lot of misinformation. Non-stop. Never ends. Here's a mobile in the Geabel. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Listen, I live in the Gables. I got through at TV many years ago when a first came out. That's a bit of a point southwest. I lied to get the network package. Then they cut me off like everybody else has been calling you and telling you a few about a year ago. But this network has had the other dish available. I've been getting the local networks. You know we don't need to network. Nobody heard that. For about a year though. Not just starting today. Yeah. Because they negotiated their own contracts a long time ago with those individual market stations. So what I'm hoping for now is that direct TV will be able to offer the local channels through the dish that I have pointing southwest so I can get rid of the second dish. That would be the ideal thing. That's the only thing I don't know about. Do you know anything about that? What run that by you see you lost me in the eye? I have no idea. You have the direct TV little dish. Yes. It points southwest. You get all the stuff that you get. ESPN or Santa's on. Every channel under the Santa's app for a dish network. You have had an additional service which became available about a year ago. Which you could purchase a dish. But you had to say that 90 degrees in the other direction. To the southwest is pointing southeast. Because the local channels. Let me say again, you're talking again. You're making it so complicated. You're not going to need to say no matter which service you've got as of now. As of yesterday with this TV and as of in just a few days with direct TV. You're not going to need any second dish. The local channel. The local network of affiliate channels will be on there. ABC, NBC, CBS and Fox. Great. I don't think you've heard of my second dish. There you go. But I've been cable free for five years. I literally got on the roof and kept the side of the bench for the good person. Good. Good. Just say goodbye to the cable. God bless you, sir. And thank God we find a guy. Somebody straight now. He's not all the person inside. God. It's for bass and up there in Wellington. Do we feel sorry for that guy in Wellington? No. No. I feel sorry for myself. Have an listen to his belly aching. We don't care, sir. Okay. For once, just for once, those of us who live here in South Florida in Miami and day in the in Broward. We have to put up with a guy named Crazy Old Cubans and the old Jews with the early bird dinners who can't drive. We have to put up with all that crap. Just once, let us have something good. Okay. Just once. Let us have something that you can have. Bastards. Oh, the white parent pond base. Well, maybe in the year 25, 25 when Zigrin Evans would come back. Maybe then they'll get around to the number 700 market in the country. Maybe you'll be in on it, but I doubt it. 567. 560. Pound 560 on the AT&T line grid letter. The editor in the Sun sent it away by the way from Keith Hogan felt in plantation. Nice going Keith. Who says restaurant owner has been punished enough. When will enough be enough from Mr. Taka Rada? The man made a mistake when that was insensitive. He said, the guy deserves a second chance of people of a quiet lifelong hatred for over his actions and don't frequent his establishment, but don't take away his livelihood because he acted foolishly and by the way, Keith, he did have a good point. Schwarzenegger's tip-lousing. Everybody said that. Even a Schwarzenegger himself, we had 75 major calls on that. So even though his action was unacceptable because it was illegal, nevertheless, some of us understand it. They tip-like crap. Mr. Taka Rada. Even alone already for Christ's poor, titanium stuff stopped raw beaten at 4% of a bitch. And by the way, isn't nice to know that at a time when we don't have enough textbooks to roll out in the schools in Dave County and when the kids can't get it lunch at the noon time every day, that mayor png did decide it about $8.7 million to save the goddamn circle, jerk. Isn't that great? Yeah. That's right. We got to save the circle. That little piece of decrepit property there because we don't want to piss off the kids to question Indians or whatever the hell it is. Isn't that the ones? Yeah. We don't want to piss them off. 8.7 million we borrowed. And he's hoping that maybe we might get it, maybe we'll find somewhere people going to make donations. So let me take a donation. No. Maybe we can have another golf tournament. Yeah, let's have a QAN golf tournament. There'll be a good scam to raise money to send the circle. Here's for a lot of deal. Hello. Yes sir. Are you doing? Okay. I am a first time caller. I am calling just listen. I live in Pemberg, Pines. I'm sorry. Okay. Uh-huh. And I do have a cable which is, uh, I'm sorry. You know. So our validation is not a work. And what happened is that, you know, I have the right to live in an I am paying $15 with 95 cents every month. $15 with 95 cents. Only, but what happened is they only charge $9. And I don't know where they are getting the A-MixTRA. $1 for $1 for one. To give the right to the division, they tie the show directly. Oh, Ray. I need to. Ray. Ray will know. Right. That's what I have. And what happened is, one day, I don't know, my wife's some day a check. You know, we'd pay by check. And, and what's the name, maybe, for a date. And the stupid people they send back and they're statement, you know, what I mean with an extra $20 because we were delay. Oh, it's your peak here. I know, I know. And I, I, I, the same time. I'm a Zadia. Yeah. I said, uh, went and out. It's not totally on, in a case. Uh, we're going to do a bit of an offer. They can't refuse, man. But I want you to do. You know what I'm talking about, I mean, sometimes when you did something you have to get it. I'm pretty sure he's going to sleep with a fish. Uh-huh. I said about, said him, I said him, I've vests with a dead fish inside. Okay. Tom, perch on this. I guess we're happy. Tom is jump on Z, like the French dude. See, I went to, um, plus what he want to watch that Ray crap anyway. That's a bad thing. I'm not good. They got all the way to the point. They're going to go down there. They're talking about this and I showed, you know, I'm, you get the little games, though, which you know, you have to understand though. Okay. But listen, the thing is that, uh, we're not butcher the satellite. Okay. I went to some rice. I was more okay. And I went inside the rice ball. It's not a rice ball. What's the sunrise and ball? What's the sunrise and ball? What's the sunrise and ball? I don't know, but you want to call that. I don't know, Italian is not there. No, not Italian. Listen. So what happened is, I brought you the satellite, the fish for $200. Yeah. And I brought you the, uh, the same, at the same time. Go change the dollar. Uh, I brought you approximately, right, right. And what happened is, I paid a next $100 for being sparing a half to pay. And it was $100. Okay. Okay. Finally, gave us an English word. Oh, we began with an F. I was great. That was sensational. This guy must know. Long's colonel. Yeah. Wouldn't surprise me. Oh, oh. Should have done. I'm Gurule. We could have done. Yeah. Bob, I'm Gurule. We're not right. Okay, pal. I'll read it out here. It's a 10-pass, no, it's $5.60 WQIM. The funds are so good. Okay. Well, for 16, whatever the hell it is, it's $5.60 WQIM. $5.60, pound $5.60, on the AT&T line, we got Hank at the Cool City at two. Blooms to with six, then we got the college basketball. The cool, the equipment and the hookrooms at the center clock tonight. Here's a mobile in the North Palm Beach, hello. Hi, Neo. Yes, sir. I was calling the talk a little bit about Junior George W. I just got my latest issue of US news and world report. And they have an article in there about he and Al Gore and how they're both quite religious. And he actually had to backpettle a little bit because he let it slip. Basically that he substituted religion for his substance abuse without saying it in those words. But yeah. Well, I just thought that made him a little scary or even then he was before because he's basically the right wing religious nut just stopped at a minute. What is the opiate of the masses and that was somebody who said that communist nut? Yes. That's been just you venture recently. Re-stated that not quite so. Yeah, before they put him back in his place, right? Right. You're putting him back in the box. Okay, thank you, sir. Whatever you just said. Anybody know what he just said? Oh, said George Bush's an asshole. We know that. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, the out of town line, the your country wide line. 877, 785, Neil. 877, 785, 6345. Very exciting news today, by the way. And the tack community is up at arms about it. All right, thank you. Oh, all they got us is just pulling our hero pocket, clumps and clumps. See because the only people I'm discovering and it's audience who have the goddamn small dish in the first place are people that were concerned about getting the West Coast CBS and who cares about that crap? Who watches network television anyway? What's the big semis with that? Yeah, I was forced off when they took it off the big dish because I was paying for that piss me off, but nevertheless life goes on. How much network programming is anybody with a brain watch anyway? Right? Yeah, exactly. Teeny, Teeny, tiny. And you're going to watch it's the same stuff on a matter of whether you watch it or not on channel 4 in Miami or channel whatever in New York. 60 minutes looks the same no matter where you watch it from. You got it? No. Here's a mobile in North Miami. Hello. Yeah, Neil. You're going to add to your computer. I'm answering your confusion on the Miami Circle. I think since it's an Indian Circle, we ought to get it back to the Indian Secularity Federal Land. Let them build a casino on the darn thing and then let them pay for it. All right. Okay, sounds good to me. All right. Okay, call up Mayor Peas and tell him. $8.7 million borrowed to save the circle. Anybody in this town make a peep about it? No. No. Because you people don't care about your kids. You can't find a bear. Sing sing. I thought that was in New York. Austin, New York, is that sing sing? Yeah, dies at the zoo up there. And everybody, oh, gee, the pen they had upon them this late the board pay. First it was Lingling. And now it's sing sing. Yeah. Three kids in Hollywood are dead from some of those gunshots again. And nobody gives a crap about that. Don't even make the front page anymore. Now it's like on the inside. There's three page 10 and then nobody to hear about it again. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing today? Listen, I'm going about the circle. I think the Indians, they won that piece of land. They're going to put a casino in there. And they're going to start showing some freak or heroes in there. Okay, thanks. $5.6.705. 60. They're going to start showing some freak or hebiz in there. You're following me, guys. Material one. You're a people. $5.6. They pound $5.60 on the AT&T line. $8.77. So look at this. Look at that. Now, no more of this. Music. European music starts tomorrow. I'm going to your Roger show. Because the information just came and chemitified out. Because I knew that the world got. I've been doing this a long time. 25%. Where did you hear these numbers? Ladies research. 25% of the audience from the New Roger show has gone to the U.F. Henry tapes. 20% of the two live Jews down at the end of the dial on the laughing. And 40% of the people have formally used to listen to this program. They're listening to disco music on Smackmobile 103. So let's see. 25, 20, and 40. 85% of our got audiences gone. Oh, even when we had the whole audience, we still can buy any calls then. So you can imagine now that 85% of our audiences have been to us for anything else that could possibly find. 15% were playing with the empty deck. Anti deck rounds with direct. By the way, I mentioned that Gary Sarners and asshole. Oh, don't ever bother me with that crap again. Gary, the answer is a big loud. Got it. No. Little louder. Low. Thank you. Get out of my life. Papa, papa, papa, papa, calm me at home. Buggany with this crap. Go have somebody else pedal it. Okay. The answer is no. No, Gary. No. Here's Oakland Park. Hello. Hey. Yes, sir. And you know, on this local networks, I've felt direct TV also. I just got the phone with direct TV. And they have two new numbers. When you call the red book customer service number, they have a automated system that tells you that they have started New York and LA. Right. And it'll be two to three weeks for the other markets. Now, they give you an 800. How come on channel 201? They're saying early December for Miami and we're counting other ones. What do you know? I've been, I've been a direct TV dealer for five years. Yeah. And it's never when they say it is. So they're lying. Okay. Well, not why. I've been a couple of weeks maybe, right? There's an 8-in and a number you call and you ask you for your telephone number. And then it comes right back and it says, not available in your area code until this thing happens. But we're looking at a couple of weeks. Yeah. Well, it really happens. Right. And it's called the, you know, like, $7 a month. And we're $5.99 a month. Well, we'll see. I've got a certain number. No, I've had it right here. They're already putting the information out. They can't change their mind. It's his local channels will cost $5.99 a month. Well, the thing is that they have to first, this is why it's going to take two to three weeks. They have to negotiate with the local affiliates. And that's what's the hold up is right now. And they've got to figure out how much the locals are going to charge the right TV. No, that's not how it works here. Well, you see. Okay. That's not how it works. It's not how it works. It's not how it works. It's not how it works. They're putting them on there. And then they have a period of time. They have six months to negotiate with the local network affiliates. Where the hell, what did I do with that thing? More and more. It is another expert. You know what this reminds me of. I reminds me of a member of the crazy satellite guy we had an IOD years ago. Crazy then Bob Lincoln even at the same time. To miracle I survived that. We had those big issues going at the same time. And we also had this crazy satellite guy. This is when the small dish was first coming out. And this man crazier than a bedbug. Tell us screaming and yelling and writing letters and calling in crank calling on a phone. Just a lunatic worth a very jackass. Oh, it's only going to be very limited number of dealers are going to be able to sell a small dish. And he's got a letter from RCA. And he's going to be the only one authorized. And of course, as soon as they came out, everybody in their brother, J.C. pennies, Walgreens. Everybody had a small dish. They were selling them at Kmart. They were selling them at Shusha in stands. Hey, you want to buy a dish here you go. It's right here. It's a shirt. Again, here's the information direct from the horses. Ask. Okay. And by the year 2002, they must carry all local locals channels in any market that they're carrying channels. And they're all sold out. And they're all sold out. Seriously, when you do this show, and you stop and think about the fact that there are people out there who place their entire lives in the hand of fairy tales from thousands of years ago. I said this the other day, I'll say it again. No printing press, no newspapers, no radio, no TV, no short waves, no nothing. Maybe a little of parchment and a pear tree. Remember the parchment family? Next set, that's all it was. Oh my gosh, it was a miracle that it was still a scary act. And here we are. I got the information of Walgreens a few pages here from the Echo Star people. And a few pages from the Direct TV. It's all right here. They're telling you what they're going to charge. Maybe that's right. Well, change after the negotiate that we negotiate whatever it is. But they've been given permission to start carrying a signal right away immediately. Now, sir, now and all of W. Now, do you get it? No. But thanks for further mutting the waters. I still think that these are all cable people calling it. Who are pinging their pants? They must be. They must have June Allison on the phone ordering cases and cases of depends. Chasing their changing their score. They're on these like it's going to an understand. 1226 at 5.50 QM. Wake up with the first piece. Joe Rogan, Jeff DeParis, and Steve Goldstein. We see more in success. Only on sports radio 5.60 QA. I think I can't have that with you, but that's not enough.

She will forget all that, I can't take that day in the summer, in the summer. So I'll pretty want to come. It is said, it is written. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. You hear the one about, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. That's right. Hand me down. Bubble my seeds. That's right. Here's coconut grove. Okay. I don't know if anybody's been talking about this today. Well, first thing I want to say is I don't listen to a fill or that other guy from New York, because I don't listen to syndicated stuff. I live in a big enough city, I can listen to good stuff made right here in my city. Okay. Now, getting down there. Well, let's find out what these people are listening to because they're not listening to this show. It's very similar to between 10 and noon. They're not listening at all. I think I've got to make more than a 3.5. I think it's a disco. It sounds silly, but I just feel dumb if I'm listening to something nationwide syndicated. There's actually on tape. Syndicated on tape. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, your show is like alive and here. Yeah, I'll listen to anyway. I'm just more interesting. But I don't know if anybody's talked about this today. I'm sorry to get on a topic thing. That's okay. Whatever you think about it, that's a little bit of a little kill. Maybe it's C. I don't. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We don't. We're not talking to you, been crap. Okay. I've had two been crap up there here. Like Brian Cox would say up there here. I don't want to hear about it anymore. No more Cuban crap. I'm drowning in a C. Well, that's a bad expression. I'm just, you know, can't handle it. Don't care about any of that stuff. If they sound insensitive, I do not care. This community has been overburdened with this garbage. You're by the way, thank you for apologizing ahead of time, sir. And your apology is not accepted. 16,000 open line. Let's find out. Let's open it up to us here today. Okay, let's stop eating around the bush. I know you all did learn to run out there. We don't have any audience left out of the show. Let's find out where they are. If you're not listening right now, give us a call. 567. No, seriously, you'll find out they're all gone. All looking around for something better. Let's lift it around for a better. This is a Roma. 567.0.560. Pound 560 on the AT&T line. America's line sitting there. That is a goddamn door nail. 877-75. Neil. 877-75. 6345. Here's cool springs, hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Welcome home. Sure. Two brutal days, man. Two unbelievably brutal days. You'll be really shun, Herman, gearing. Neil, first of all, I do listen to the evening. Even though I'm in the evening. Why don't you know, care what you're listening to in the evening? That's fine. More power to you. I will power to him too. There is a problem with Phil Schoen. Now, well, what just happened there? What just happened to this guy that just got chopped off here, huh? Call me back, sure. I want to hear what you were going to say. See, I still think that somebody's dickin' with this. Look at that. I got one call up in the board and our calls are getting yanked. What's going on here now? 567-0560, pound-560 on the AT&T line. Is there something going out with these phone lines? I don't think so. Here's a mobile and open park, hello. Hey, Neil, one time listener. Yes, sir. I've had the dish for a year and a half. Uh-huh. It's great. I think it's a lucky one, don't know why, so I have it. But I got the ABC. It's still a new arc in LA and I think it's great. Yeah. And I think we should be able to get all the other people to let this drop all country, if you want it. Hey, sir. That isn't the issue. That's not the issue. Thank you so much. You have a great life. It's not the issue. Damn it. Damn it. Damn it. It's not the issue. The issue is that the local network affiliates, which is the ones that they make you watching the first place now, they are now going to be available on the small dish, which means you don't need the Saturday a cable for anything. And they just can't get it. They just, I don't understand how people who've gotten on this stand very easily, if you never had a satellite dish of any kind, that you're confused, especially after listening to this crap today, that you're just totally in the dark. Like, what's it all about alpha? But how could you possibly have had a dish and be so uninformed and be so ignorant as to what it's all about living in a cocoon somewhere, living with a cocoon somewhere? God is it frustrating, no matter what it is in his town, it's like, I'm talking sense here, I'm talking, I know what I'm talking about, I've had for 12 years now. I had the big, for addition, I had a 12 footer, then I had the 10 footer, I got a big dish of small dish of medium dish, I got no kishar, I got a place you, I got a China that hasn't been invented yet. And it's like you're talking in Sanskrit to these people, you're talking in different languages, forget about the goddamn network of affiliates from New York and Chicago and that's not the issue here. That's not what this bill has got to do with. What are you doing with these people? What are you doing? I think you just have to go out there and start killing them. Yeah, killing with kindness. Like Monty Python said, lightly killed. Here's a mobile and four-letter deal, hello. Hey, Neil got. Yes sir. I just got a dish myself, was waiting until they said they were going to be putting the locals on, they're putting them on, I got the dish, they hell with medium one. There you go, that's very simple. Congratulations sir, God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. And have a great life. There you go. Two and a half hours later, I find I get a guy to understand what it's all about. Bless you sir, bless you my child. Somebody QAM tour just wandering around, hello. How are you doing? Okay. People that got disconnected from the major, Naive Horses, you know, it went up to the 300's now. They will be able to get re-hooked up provided to have a beat or less. Okay, I don't care. Don't care, I'm not interested in talking about that. Okay, I don't care. Not interested. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, what happened to the guy to call the guy cut off? The guy from Girl Springs. Maybe his phone died. Or maybe he, oh, I'm sorry. Here's Naples, hello. Okay, Neil, you know, the same people that are not getting all this or the same people they're falling for. Hey, it's the millennium at the end of the year. Uh-huh. You know, we're going to be lined up at the ATM on December 28 taking out their life savings. $20 at a time. What are they going to do next year when, when they realize that, oh, yeah, this is the real millennium. You know, don't start confusing them, sir. I'll read you last, please. It's on the broken wheel of apathy, man. This state runs on the broken wheel of apathy. I'm out. Put him out. Put him out of his misery. Nice and Naples. With the beesleys. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Oh, I'm sorry. We can't talk about the beesleys. It's the quiet period. I'm sorry. Quiet period. Come on. How come we're not hearing from all these other people about where they are every day? Why can't you people be honest? Okay, it's not going to hurt my feelings. George doesn't give a crap. We get paid the same easy amount. One way or the other, especially him. I think our tough George has got to go and act. That's not an apparent schedule. Maybe for this weekend. Maybe. And nobody will tell him where it is and what is that and what's going to be going on or what time. But other than that, it should be great. A soldier paid for it. Here on here, he didn't care. He'll give a pay for it while we're the other. That's how dumb those people are. I'm sorry. Just like the people that golfed hermit. I mean, you wonder why everybody was so hysterically aware that we weren't reading the promos, which we didn't have. Because then they were wrote them in the first place. Because 110 grand that they made. It wasn't for any spouse. It was for mentions on promos. you understand that, don't you? Dig it, oh, you're going to get 8875 promotional mentions on the worst team in the awardures in Hank Goldberg. And yeah, and we don't get any promos when I read you. And that's why they have a nervous connection fit because actually these people are going to still wonder where the hell is all my three mentions for the 110 grand that they siphoned out of that golf tournament. The OJ golf can remember that one. Oh, yeah, but you do. So to my arteries. 21 before one at five, 60 WQM. Sports leader. We have the least. Sports radio, 560. QA. And I'll stay at the Edolebanyo. Or the Alicorda. Am I telling you? Yeah, me either. It's 18 to one. And George just informs me. Let's see line one. We can't even get that hollowstone on our camera. Line three. Bed. That is a door nail. And maybe that's what happened when that guy disappeared. I think Bell soft is farting with our lines again. Is what's going on here. And seven. How about that one? There he goes. There's one that works. The out of town line is working on 10 to that. 877, 785, Neil. 877, 785, 6345. As we continue drowning in a sea of misinformation here today. This town man, they could take the happiest moment of your life. They could take a gigantic whipping orgasm and turn it into a grotesque episode. I'm telling ya. They could have been tears in 30 seconds or less. Here's something great. Here you go guys. Here's something to add. Little bit of that. Little bit of that. Yeah. What about Danny Boy? I'm sorry. Here's Miami. Hello. Anywhere. I got the dish about three years ago. I lived with my parents. And my dad was very content with his TCI and all until the table now. A couple days he called and I had my cables out. Can you have somebody come out? They told him there was going to be two weeks, two weeks. The day before they were supposed to come out, they called to verify. Nobody was home. The next day nobody comes out. My dad calls again and says, they say, well, we called to verify the day before. So now you got to wait another two weeks. My dad said, okay, I got to wait another two weeks. We're in out, water receiver. Put in in his room. Call the cable company. The next day said cancel my service. Right. You know that those cockroaches were out the next day to cancel the service? Good. If you mean service, it's going to take you a month. No, but I'm glad they walked the next day because I mean, you didn't have to get charged in extra minute. That's for sure. You know, and my dad went, now my mom, you know, she wasn't technically advanced. So, you know, she sort of hated it. But what the hell, my dad was in his glory. How technically advanced you have to be to punch a channel? Well, you know, it is. She liked her local channels. So to go back and forth between the DSS and the TV. It was sort of like a mission, you know, with my mom. You know, you know, you know, a little Brazilian old lady. I mean, you know, you got to keep it simple for it. Get her a little TV with the rabbit ears. I'm going to point the target. But as far as like the local channels, I mean, it's like you said, I'm happy that they're coming on. But I really stopped watching local TV when I got to fish. Right. I mean, you know, I really am. I'm happy that I'm going to, you know, when I do see local TV, I'm going to have a clear crisp picture. You know, because right now, all we got is rabbit ears. And, you know, it's very fuzzy and all. But, you know, occasionally I like to see the news. You know, we're saying, I want to go that way. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, there she goes. But, you know, it's good news. So, I mean, everybody who's got complaints. I mean, come on. Get a life. Get with it. Okay. Thank you. So, you got blessed. And Mama Seeta, too. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. Of course, what am I getting excited about? Because most of our lines don't work anyway for a change. Nice going there again, Greg. Yeah, maybe after this quiet period is over. Maybe they connect the collected up money. Maybe we can get a phone system here that works. You think so? No. Keep prick. Always a cheap prick. Make them a stick about that. Let's say, be sure prick. Here's a mobile little Polake, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. I mean, I do. I don't know if you caught Jay Leno the other night. I don't have a watch, Jay Leno. I wouldn't watch Jay Leno if you paid me by the second. Well, I immediately just watched the model. He was talking about the NFL's coming down hard on these NFL players that are using the throat slack and they had a problem because every time they do that, OJ gets a royalty on it. Yeah, it sounds like a Leno line. That's all I got. Oh, that's it. Okay, thanks. That was good. Oh, man. Yeah, exactly. How do you like that? He calls to give me a Jay Leno line like that. And I'm sure you saw the thing, but you're a two-agor-way. They showed Jay Leno sitting up at all the writers on a weekend till 3-4 in the morning. He's got 15 writers and they're sitting there. Yeah, listening to all these great lines on cassette tapes. Boy. How do you like that? This is it here for four hours every day. Spontaneously. How do you think you want to do a Jay Leno? Oh, one time. Oh, no. Try to entertain. He's just stubborn. How do you find one by the way? Well, that one's working good. 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T line. And 877, 785, Neil, which is for Palm Beach 2 by the way. And Fort Myers, and Nebraska Florida, and the Atari US of A toll free. 877, 785, 6345. Well, I'll tell you these gracious holidays if I ever survive it. That's why every year. That's what I've done to do with my birthday. It's got to do with this particular time of the year and the mindset. I go from home from here yesterday. I have never seen so many, I mean, just on an average day any time of the year, the people driving around you here are crazy. But yesterday in a special category of craziness, learn the ticks. Because it's that time of the year. It's the Goiish holidays again. Should live in Hollywood where we move now. No thanks. Frog paradise. No thanks. Once a week, the mommy's house is on the way. And Hollywood. Yeah, once is enough. You ought to see the way they drive in the complex where mommy lives. They're sitting on 15 telephone books in their head still is only up to the bottom of the steering wheel. And their hand there above their head like this. And they're terrified. They're scared to death. If they're here every year, how come they still don't know the way around? They know their way around. They're just taking their time to get there. What's the hurry, Sunny? What? They're pointing as they drive. Like, oh, look, there's a tree. It'll look at a restaurant. That's only the old Cubans. Here's Mark O'Lyle and you got the wrong finger. Mark O'Lyle and hello. Neil, God. I got it just about a year ago. And I would care about the local news over here because it's really boring. All of it is about old people on a shuffle board. So all that kind of neat stuff. But have you heard about this direct PC? No. From the same outfit, direct TV. I'll just want to finish your collar. So subscribe to it or anything like that. I don't know. I don't know if I'm ready to handle this. If we get back into thing with the computers again, I will kill myself on a year. I'll go to a clock. I'm not going to talk about it. If I had to go in with the Rotor-Wooder guy in the Aurora, the Rotor-Wunner, and the DSL guy, I'll crack in the handle. Sir, I want to take it this right now. Computers are for kids and for crazy people and nobody else. Well, I guess I fit into one of those categories. You and me both. Have a great thing. Okay. Because if you weren't crazy when you started with your computer, very shortly thereafter, you'll be going, the movie would look like that. You'll change your name to Ish Kabibble. Believe me. Thanks a lot, Jerry Sarner, for stealing a day out of my life. And when you get to be this old, you don't have that many left. Okay, Jerry. So to you, you jackass. God, where did it go? Where did it go? What kind of effect do we do to this stamp out the Gary Sarner's and Todd Drexer this world? Not to mention fat boy. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. We pay for it. 12 free HF. And by the way, where's the we had to one guy who started on the verge? You listen to fill it night there, through the static. And it was about on the verge of saying something. And he got yanked. And that was the end of that. And the rest of these people are lying through their teeth. You're not full in this old fossil. Okay, you're not full in me. Oh, and now we switch back and forth. And when you go into commercial break, and then we listen to Margaret for two minutes. And then we didn't even want to break that. Yeah, right. Whatever you guys say, you just pull a crap. You know, you just don't want to be just don't want to come clean, man. You're going to come scored scored come clean. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Hey, there's a nail great show. Yes, sir. I just wanted to say that I'm very pleased that they let the local program and go on and get dish. Yes. So I can tell my favorite laughing. Can we tell us say their name? Sure. I definitely I. Loast class, low quality. I got more shopping channels on there than they got in the mall. Oh, I get it. They want to sell me something. Yeah. So now they're going away. I get the dish. They see to go on them all for 1999. I'll throw in this side in the other. Right. They'll even throw in an extra touch time for damn arena on Sunday. Right. And as I sit here on I'm 95. So I hope we got I'm watching a lovely family change a tire in the median lane for people looking at a tire. And everybody in I'm 95 going south just like commercial work has to stop and cut see and say hello. And now we'll pass them so now if you take it any action go away. And I'm going away now too. Okay. Good luck, Brown. Okay. Okay. Here's our lunch from Tony's 13th and North West second avenue. Can I get that right? Yeah. Well, hey, I don't know. I'm old and feeble. I don't know what that is. We love Tony's pizza, baby. We love our buddy Brad over there. Tony's just don't stop me. It's a turn play anymore. But do say hi to my good friend Sylvia. I have to be with you. We are. Haven't seen Sylvia in a while. Probably because I was out of town. Welcome to QA and Batline. Hello. Yes sir. This is a game's full. Gainesville. All right. I don't think you would have gotten this story. But I want the first to tell you that. The whole type of thing was in the UF newspaper a couple of days ago. It was in the FU paper. Yeah. Yeah. We're the FU people because they're trying to tune in because the governor Jeff's trying to do this disorder. One thing is trying to eliminate a firm of action. They're trying to tie it in with that. Saying that we don't need we don't need to get rid of a firm of action. Because this is still people up there that are racist. Yeah. That's right. That's what the governor said. We don't need to get rid of a firm of action. Just we get rid of the shparsis. What he said. Well, that's a start. I don't think you're right about this. But there are two different bus companies that run buses on the weekend. Yeah. There run from Gainesville to Miami back to Gainesville Sundays. This past weekend on the West Palm Beach toll Plaza. One of the bus drivers of one of the buses. Tap the owner of the other bus company. Yeah. We had a call yesterday. Oh, digger. Unbelievable. I took that bus home for the breeders cup a couple of weeks ago. Yeah. I couldn't. That's right. But these are these are these are Cuban. Is these are Latin. Right. And they're running back before probably weekends. Oh, you never know. That's where they have a short. I'm just going to blame it on them in a minute. Uh-huh. And the fiddels not coming to the world. Trade summit. I was very disappointed. I wanted to see fiddell on TV talking about free trade. Everybody can share with everybody else. He can't trade with the people in the federal border. That's all. There you go. Okay, pal. Love you. I don't. I don't. JP. He's listening. Is he listening? JP. Oh, he's good and laid. Five six seven. Five sixty. Five sixty on the AT&T line. The out of town. I'm just head of call from Gainesville. That's your first out of town for real call that any. I think so. And that line is bitterly disappointing. And we got 55 million people listening on the internet. But they don't have the balls to call me. See that's the problem. More and more. Pushies out there. They just don't have the guts to talk to me. Don't talk and argue with George because they figure he just some little spick. But then after a while, let's start getting intimidated by him. And he'll be sitting here screaming in the oven begging for calls. You mark my words. And by the way, didn't we have tapes on Thursday and Friday last week? Cause it was a how was Thanksgiving? Oh, yeah. And all new people, let's say, oh, yeah, we hate George. We love the tapes. How come when I come back yesterday after two days of tapes? I could have been farting into a goddamn windstorm and head of a response. But it didn't people call saying how much they loved them. Yeah, that's right. How come we didn't say, oh, Jesus tapes were great last Thursday and Friday. And you know, that sure is how beats that little spick you put on there. Who does goddamn religion and swing or clubs? Now these people are playing real close to the West these days. They don't want to, you know, reveal too much. That's the probabilities bastards. They're just all in the closet with each other. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, and I've been calling for my cap and hour. And when you dial the number says that the lines being checked or that might be why you're not getting calls. Because you can't get through it. Because our phones are all screwed up. As usual, has anybody called him with the story about Robert Staci and Parade magazine Sunday? Sorry about what? Robert Staci? No. And Parade magazine? Yeah. Well, whatever. I'll flip into the questions and crap. Okay. I almost got the F-word on you. The question was, were P-A-L, World Champion, Skate Shooter and the 30s and the 40s? And yes, he was. He said that in the 30s and the 40s, that was the macho thing from Lynn and Hollywood. Did this. I wonder how far he could shoot it. Yeah. That's all. Okay, thanks. Well, I got read Parade magazine, George. What do you expect? Where did he come from? He was about. He wonders how far Robert's stack could shoot it. Anybody got there worried about Robert's stack, sex life? No. I do like Robert's stack though. He was right in airplane. And he's written on solid mysteries. That's one of my old time favorite shows even on Iran's. And 75 different discovery and A&E and all of the guy in place. Great show. I just like seen it there with it. It looks like a dirty old man in a trench coat. 1256 and 560WQAN. The Neil Roger show. The show sports radio. 560. QA&E. I'm a hell of a food party day. It's a lot of the people out there. I'm a hell of a food party day. It's a lot of the people out there. Don't you love Bill Bradley? Yeah. Don't we need Bill Bradley? It's probably 60. Yeah. Don't we need Bill Bradley? It's probably 60. Tom. Played for basketball. Don't you love Bill Bradley? Yeah, we need him Bradley. He's gonna win the race. People love him cause he is the doctor's or... Did I mention that he is the doctor's or... He played for the day. He doesn't borrow a stick. Yeah, we love him cause he is the doctor's or... Not alcohol. Not alcohol. Not alcohol. Not alcohol. Yeah, he's not alcohol. I'll say it one time. We love Bill Bradley. Mostly cause he is not... Boring, palper, gore. Well, don't you love Bill Bradley? Oh, right. Don't you love Bill Bradley? Come on, two at five. She's the WCM. I mentioned how much we love to have Brad over at Tony's. Man, this is good today. Isn't it? Am I just hungry? Is this extra good? Huh? Oh, he's talking to somebody. I wonder who to tell you he's just ignoring me again. I thought it'd get. Oh, no, it really is. That's 193... What is it? 193 29 Northwest Second Avenue? Tony's pizza, man. They have got some really great stuff. Getting pretty good. It's getting right up there. You know what I'm saying? Tony tell it. It's getting right up there. Hmm. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. We have a couple lines working. We have several other not working as usual. Here's a call from Cincinnati. Hello. Uncle Meal. Yes, sir. Hey, you are the best. Yeah. How's it going? How are we, sir? I agree. I just wanted to tell you that I was living down there in South Florida last year. I lived there for a year and the only thing that got me through the day was listening to your show. That's what they all say. It's the best. Even though they're all gone, now the whole audience has gone, but they still believe that. But I like to sell my child's working as an urban planner down there. Yeah. And I came up here back to Ohio to major in mass calm. So I could do something like your shit because it's so awesome. I just wanted to show you that. Okay. Good luck, pal. Thank you. Thanks for setting your very best from Cincinnati. They send their very best from Dayton Broward from Palm Beach, from Fort Myers from Port Charlotte. No. Do you put her to question? No. Since an AD they do, though. Thank you, Lord, for him. And we still have not had one response to my question. Now you know God damn well that there are people that did learn around on that. You know that, for a fact. Don't you know that. And have we had one person call and said, even heard those best in the old tapes on Thursday and Friday? Which I wasn't even aware of that Friday or we had to take because I forgot it was like a four day weekend, right? Because I wasn't here, thank God. Can we had one person call who said that they heard those best in the old who listened to that crap on Thursday and Friday? No. No. All the same people that are always bashing you a little ass. We're waiting man. We're sitting here waiting on you. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. 877, 775, 633, 445, 877, 785, Neil on the worldwide line. Are these other lines working now or what? Huh? This is unbelievable. Here's David. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. How you doing? How should be in persistent on the phone because it's hard to get through our chaos. What? That's true. I was getting busy signal for at least a half an hour. I don't have any calls here for months for years. I haven't had a bunch of calls in 20 years. I think I just want to let you know that 10 to 12, I do listen to another radio station other than yours. And what is that? Phil Landry. Yeah. He originally turned me on to you and then of course he left and came back. So I just kind of switched back and forth from you from 10 to 12. I know it. It's tough. It means between all the commercials and all. These are all the commercials on one. I'm both both stations. Yeah. You know, he's too many spots. Yeah, exactly. I haven't seen this in a quest too. Is that possible? Even though you admit that you're listening to Phil between 10 and noon and you want me to play a request? No problem. Since I have any one other call on the board, no problem. That's just my brother's listening. He's a big red dog fan. I was wondering if you could play the red dog commercial form. Okay. Thank you, Neil. And have a great day, sir. You too. You got to feel. You got to meet. You sound a red dog. You chugged a red wool. Now open your mouth and wrap your lips around our red cock. Red cock's folly head will leave you breathless. Red cock goes down easy and it's never hard on your throat. So reach into that box and wrap your fingers around a long neck red cock. You can shake it and spray it all over. Remember, you can't eat a red cock. Just look for the label with the big red pecker on the front. Oh, that's my favorite pizza that sausage in bottle caps. Yeah, especially the bottle cap that looks like a little onion. See your laugh and the evidence is right in the way. It's always still a lot of your bread. It was like a little bottle cap on one slice. I mean, you know, a little plastic bottle cap. It would go right through your soft against wouldn't it? No. Look at this phone. I don't get it. Half the lines out working. All of a sudden, everybody's gone dead. People are coming to get and busy signals. I just, you know, don't know whether to keep eating pizza or what. Just one day before I finish this dead on this guy, day and radio station. Just one day, I'd like to do the entire four hours. Number one with a bunch of calls. But number two with all the four lines working. Wouldn't that be nice, huh? Yeah. I can just hear the beat splicing and wouldn't it be nice? Is it never going to happen? Probably not. Probably not because they're too busy. You think I'd dig her fish to fry? I don't know. It's the quiet period. But they got bigger fish to fry than worried about giving us stuff that works in here. Like a real radio station. You're at a screen, Greg. You're an embarrassment. You're a humiliation. I'm just embarrassed to help for you. Here's a mobile and sunrise. Hello. Hello? Yes, sir. Yeah. I'm in competent on now. Here's a mobile and pop-er-o. Hey, Nick. How are you doing today? Okay. I didn't listen to you for about 10 years now. About five years ago, you kept talking about your dish and I went out and got a big dish. Right? And I love my big dish. But then I got the little dish. And today is the greatest day in the world. And now I can watch the local TV again. Because I mean, I really felt really aggravated when the government went in the hours. You know, about a year and a half ago. So today is a great day for people out here who are trying to get rid of. For the small handful of us who got a good good. You got to get rid of that right. Right. Yeah. I'm not in the think category as you. Yeah. Now what's this happening to him? I just want to go on record right now. I was telling you this. This phone system is FU whatever goes in between ED. Okay. I need a positive strain. Just because we make this happens too somewhat when you can manage the old voice Because when we love it, you actually need positiveɪ to judge the party fromyaab through hearing the game, and it's also nice to use a positive pausetechnic. This phone system blows. And you people in management here at this radio station. You ought to be. You oughta be quartered and drawing is what you oughta be. Okay. other people's voices and when you depend on a phone, talk in a living and breathing people and you have a phone that doesn't work, it makes it just a little bit difficult. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. A Pox on the Beesley's, okay? A chicken pox on the Beesley's. I'm calling up Mickey Dane, the great day and have it a part of God damn curse on these people. On these cheap incompetent, want to Beesley's. But cheapest and the chintiest and the crappiest, I was going to say that money can buy but of course they don't pay for it. So you know, that money might buy, if they were paid their bills. Out of town line is open 877-785 Neo, how is the line one doing? Is that working? There it is. No. Has line three doing that working? No. Just one day Greg, just once for four solid hours, all nine lines actually functioning. Now I'm not suggesting they're all going to ring because we lies the whole audience's listening to the grand disco music now. But whatever we got out there, what at least give them an opportunity to call and make some sound, some even that would be good. Compared to this crap. God. Sports radio line 60s. See you. Hey.

Alright, we got the 7 million co-spots here. Thanks to both of Brian. We can kill some good-tab and kill a whole show with this tomorrow. Here's a lady in candle. Hello. Hi, I'm Yelka. Yes, ma'am. Our only lady of the day. How are you today? Okay. I was an unfortunately living home-stead. That lovely town. I'm a nice Jewish girl that I was called. I'm married to the Mexican guy. Oh, yeah. I have the worst cable in the world. That's not for you. Everybody seems to seem to be except for that one guy. The first guy I called this morning. Everybody else hates a selfie like poison. I'm telling you, we've had nothing. The context I live in is mostly choices. They want to allow us to get the satellite dish. I talked to the manager. He wants to allow you to do it from stuck with us. I hate to break the news to you. It's against the law. That was passed like two years ago. He no longer has the option of letting you or not doing it. He's not because of that that this way. I think I'm making it. What is this? What is this? What is this? What is this? I'm like you worry about this marches. You'll get what as many dishes as you want. No big place you can for the weekend too. Because my husband he likes to touch the Mexican soccer. Which I think is very boring. Oh my god. Give me your better off without it. I'm telling you. And you know how much money I'm getting towards. Even without an impact on anything like that. None of the cables and regular basic cable. $50 a month. I'm not kidding. $50 a month. Just for a plain old basic cable. Exactly. You know you get like a fixed channel. $50 out. $45 something a month. That's what it's costing us. I would tell them the stick that cable right in there. Back to. Isn't that a gift? Yeah, I tell them to bend over and open-wise. I have never in my life. I mean. I mean. You have to carry it. You have to have it. Well we don't have to. Well of course now wait on there. You know to pick up anything and guess you need it. I know we have it disconnected. I went on one stage when it was WTVJ. Which is the worst piece of crap I've ever been. Right. Who the hell wants to watch this? I want to know that I am a woman and I do listen to your station every single day. Well thank God for you. I'm taking a survey here today but nobody wants to bite except the other guy who was stuck up to Fool. And I'm trying to talk to my husband and get it and I like this because I don't want that piece of crap out there if they're crap. I mean honestly they're okay. To make him do it. Okay cut him off until he goes out and get it. I will. Take care. Make his sharpest him at the bed every night. Have a great day. You too. Hey America. Hey America. Hey America. I'm a man with a little cold. Oh, right. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. And I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. I'm a good guy. And I'm a good guy. Well this is great except the course for the fact coke pulls the rads from the WWF because they don't like the language. And they also didn't like a Walmart subset because the customer complained that they had a doll on the shelves at Walmart depicting a WWF wrestler carrying around a woman's head. Oh, it's wrong with that. The toy is modeled after Alston though, a wrestler who carries a feeling a female mannequin's head in the ring. The doll comes with a woman's head with the help me scrolled back with a crawster forehead. What's wrong with that? Nothing in the sale. As long as it's somebody white. We don't have to hear the easy beats. I mean you won't believe all the artisans who were on this guy damn disc. There must be 75,000 different artists doing post-bond. It was easy beats right now. And then later, it's the little easy beat. All right. I will never fall in that and say, nah. I'm going to go to the hospital. I'm going to go to the hospital. Just go hot. I can't be right. I'm going to go to the hospital. You are there, man. Don't be the one talking to me. Oh my god, the tremolo's. What was their big hit to tremolo's? Come on, Brian. Come on, let's. And as if that is enough when I hear a girl writing the middle of your erected white and your who else is on here. One of them looks really bad. The other one looks like deathball. The big hit to tremolo's. And then again, I want you to pick it up first and pass it on. Come on. That's a great hit. That's a lucky time to break through. And go for a fight. Oh, God. Oh, it's way. I can see what we're going to be doing tomorrow. Oh, there's a fight. Oh, yeah. I got Friday on my mind already. Just from the guy damn easy beats. Boy, I love that song. That was a great song. Isn't it? Easy beats, Friday on my mind. Medley of their smash. They're probably still living off the residuals just to that one great song. You know, tremolo's. Did we decide what the tremolo's big song was? Here comes the big song. Here comes the big song. Here comes the up Chuck feeling you again. Yeah. Oh. 21, 2, 5, 60, WQX.
