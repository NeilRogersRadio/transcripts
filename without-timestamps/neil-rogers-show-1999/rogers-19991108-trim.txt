Well, don't tell her. I think I'm close to pony tail. He's got bad coolies. Don't get near him. He's got other kinds of stuff. Believe me. He's like a walking incubation tank. Yes, they were going. Yes. Don't get anywhere near him. I thought he was married. No, he's divorced. Oh, okay. In other words, if you thought he was married, you were going to out him on the air here, right?

Well, she didn't say which pony tail could have been what he had. Could have been what he had. Could have been tiny. He's got a pony tail. Or could have been Jeff Kahn. Could have been one of those. At the swing club. If it was good enough for Bob Green to go there. He was a general manager of our radio station. It was good enough for him. What's wrong with that? It's a public place. It's open to the public. This is a legitimate place. Joe Christel was there. Yeah. Yeah. Wouldn't he be a lady friend? I was there. I hope. Investigating. Investigating. Investigating. Investigating. Just watching. Of course. Yes. Well, let me ask you this. If everybody who goes there just watches, what's the point? There's a small percentage of people who do do do do do do do do do. Yeah. They're doing. They're doing your watching. I would imagine pony tail would be one of the small. He was definitely not watching. I guarantee you that. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T. We got forty in her. I want to tell you one thing. The last week last week on the show was enough to make you want to go. Home and put your head in your hand and cry. That's how great the phone response was on the show last week. Last week was another one of those. Far weeks that this town has you know what I just taking a week off. Okay. And I have a feeling that this week can't fit a bit too much better. I could be wrong, but I just get that feeling. I know it's Monday. Let's not prejudge you early in a week. But I just have that feeling and to put it in my stomach and to put it in my Bolls. It's going to be very much like last week. Here's Miami. Hello. You know, I'm sorry. I just tuned in. Have you mentioned your article? And the hell? Be sectioned up all about OJ today. I got it here. So I haven't got to with yet. You know, they're saying that he's being treated unfairly. What about the treatment he gave me to Cole and what? Okay. Thank you. Thanks for your bringing observation, sir. There was a good call.

To kick that out against the wild date. I couldn't care about that. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Hello. Yes. Secondly. Can I change the subject on sport? What does that mean? Change the subject on sport. I just want to change the subject. And talking about a million things you're already this morning. You want anything you want, pal? All right. Here's what's going on. This is what I can in this Daniel. Would this, as each day and week pass, this government gets, we live and get more more asked backwards. How in the hell is Microsoft and monopoly? But at the same time, you got the DOJ and the FTC. You're not going to be allowing clear channels to buy up all these stations. Right. I mean, that's correct. I mean, clear channels. There are updates and owns all the channels. Yeah. They don't have the stations. There are more organizations. Yeah. Microsoft is a monopoly. Yeah. And then we're going to let all the TV stations you've got all that by four or five companies do. And do the same thing. I don't know. I've gained a re-do even the biggest thing. I think they just got a thing in for Bill Gates to jealous because he's got more money than the government. I don't know. The just thing really is fine. Get me five on pissed off. I'm not interested. I guess if I had a lot of stock in Microsoft, I'd be upset. But I don't. Yeah. But they would like to get to know Bill Gates. Yeah. But they're kind of guy you'd like to get to know real well. You know, like, be real real good friend. I like his autograph. But I don't want his autograph. I like to have a autograph on a check. Maybe not his autograph. He's a nerdy boring guy. But I like to have his autograph on a check. Hey, but it'll lend me two three million. Okay. Well, steady. I'm going to get great steady. Get Gregory. I'll definitely check. Oh, okay. Did you get the loan of that? No. Gregory doesn't sign the checks. I hate to break the news to you. But no checks are written over here because they don't trust Greg. With the money. Right. All the checks come from Naples. Isn't that tell you what? Oh. Hey. Exactly. Have a great day. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on the AT&T line. Eight, seven, seven, seven, eight, five, Neil. Eight, seven, seven, seven, seven, eight, five, sixty, three, forty, five on the out of town line. Whatever. But that's serving this week. Probably within four county radius. Nine minutes after 11 a Q. And slow ringing. Down I have dirt. It's straight from the Vatican. Introducing new Catholic life. The religion which one third the guilt of your regular faith. New Catholic life satisfies your need for Christianity, but it doesn't fill you up with a lot of doctrine. Or a village. Or a village. Catholic life. There's no confession. No servants and no lingering afterlife. It's the perfect alternative for modern agnostics. And don't want to take any chances. Our services are held three times a year. And they'll make the 15 minutes long. Plus there's no added guilt for speaking out during communion. We've dropped that too. Look for our church reveal in your neighborhood. Hey, you might be in the front view. For a year of little faith. Try Catholic life. Because a little faith is all you need. 11, 13, at five, sixty, seventy, twenty, two. I've noticed more and more lately. By the way, these athletes crossing themselves like the field rule kicker. There was one who came out yesterday at Julio. What do I mean? I don't know if I can really marginal make believe in. And he comes out there about another five foot tall, a midget guy. And kicks this field rule. And he's like crossing himself before. And then he got put red riggas on Texas who does that every is that every bat every every pitch I think. Yeah, every guy then pitches like cross themselves. I see this all the time. And I'm saying to myself, Eee! You stop a brainwashing voice and then the stigma stuff comes along. So we had to call about that yet. No. No cost. No good. I'm going to talk about this stigma. Here's what I want to walk out of here. Who would blood on his hands. Okay? I mean stuff. It's just so ridiculous on the face of it. And people keep doing it. Of course, they're sure you're man. When you can dig it. It's like a dog. It's that top-loved thing. You ring the bell and the dog is like, is a salivating all over the guy down place. Like Jeff Cohen at the swing club. You know, he rings the doorbell and he's already salivating. He's not even on the inside yet, so to speak. We don't want to talk about pony taildoin. No. But my dad never said that. All those Joey's just telling me. Five, six, seven, five, sixty pound, five, sixty on the AT&T line. Eight seven, seven, eight, five, sixty, three, four, five on the Florida line here's Pemba Pine. Hello. Hello, me Oh. Yes. And it's a real travesty this year at the all-star game. Ray Whitney is not on the ballot. Can you believe that? Yeah. I don't believe it. I don't know. Yeah. I'm going to vote for Victor Godlaw. Yeah. I can't believe it. Hey, and the guidance though. if we had any hockey fans in this time, I mentioned about Paul Velberry who's going to be out again for another team through this broken piggy. How come nobody is talking about that? Nobody knows what to say that gave the guy $8 million a year. What do you mean nobody knows what to say? I mean it's unbelievable. We got screwed again. The Murray's are added to Schrokesman's. Yeah. You should have given Whitney a little bit more money and then spread it around. I'm like, you know, Sharral, he was damaged good. Maybe they just have one of those magic ones. They can find a magic of the damage goods with. Maybe that's what it is. You think it's a magic wand? Five, six, seven, oh five, sixty. Here's our last call for Call City and I'm going to crack on at the Bravo Allstars the rest of the day. We'll get some food. Yeah, there you go. Joe's a game for that. Let's get some goddamn food in here and screw these bastards. I mean, just like they got to cause about the OJ thing, which I got to sing sliced out here. So the speaker, which I was going to talk about. Oh, what about what you did to run in the cool? Well, there's a very, there's an interesting observation, sir. That's excellent. Brilliant. Here's a mobile and baby. Hello. Yeah, sir. Hello. I wanted to see if you witnessed those injector for this commercial forbearance. No, I have not. He is in a shower with a black man. I don't know what it is. What is in a shower with a black man? Yes, sir. It was on TV last night. It was a commercial on ESPN. Oh, thebearance commercial. Yeah. It's quite interesting. He was burinist. He was. Yeah. And he thought the thought of seeing Jeff and Ford into showers and off the neck. We canceled that lunch order. I agree. But Jeff was in quarters. It was a black man that was not in close. Nick, is a jay bird. Yes, he was. Okay. Okay. Have a great day. He was just about to do a request there when he got cut off. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. 877, 785, 70 whatever that number is. It's an impossible number man. Even I can't remember what it is. 877, 785, Neil, any I.L. on it the Florida line. Here's my me, Beach. Hello. Hey, I just came to the end. How are you going today? Okay. With that God's will that came that concrete on and in on those doors up. Uh huh. That's right. Okay. Well, I got to say. Okay. Thanks. These people are got nothing to say today. Last week they had very little to say today they have nothing to say. Nothing, zippity, doodas, zippity A. Don't bother waiting because we got nothing to say. 560, 0560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. 877, 785, 6345. The only thing you know something this is the only place in the world. Not just in America. Not just in North America. The only place in the world. I realize we don't have 10 hockey fans out there. But a guy's getting $8 billion a year to perform. He's a miss is every other guy named uh game he's out in. He gets a broken pinky finger. Guys get 28 stitches get their head sliced open. Get 28 30 stitches come back and finish the game. And these people are got what do they got to say? Eeeeh! And all they want to know is when the big sparks are coming back. Then we'll come out and see the team. It's just amazing to me. It's astonishing. Here's a lady in Bokeh. Hello. Hi, you know. Yes, man. I wanted to let you know there are incompetent colors that listen to you and call in. I expect what you go home and cry over your columns like you did last week. I don't call him and cry. I just count the money. Whatever works for you. Um, I listened to some of your colors and I think I am supposed to find a house and out of this bunch. Your team pole makes me want to throw some chlorine into it. Uh-huh. Um, I just want to let you know, listen to from data and college everywhere you go. We don't have any colors anymore. I mean, the art of calling the talk show is it's history. It's done. It's the needle. Art of being human is finished down here. Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm going to go get some radiation poisoning. I'll see you later. Hi. Yeah. Let's just sit and stick our hand into microwave. What do you think? Sounds like a good idea. I'm going to give it away to kill a couple more hours. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line. So Tom Jick and his column question. And I know Tom makes these up. There's no doubt in my mind. Have you heard anything on Brook Daniels produce your manic Larry being suspended? Maybe even fired after Brook uttered the F word. And he failed to dump it. Or anything on WQAM's OJFES go in the suspension that followed SG via email allegedly says Tom. Allegedly. Tom writes, my colleague, Josie, Jose, whatever his name is, lambbeat, had several items on both controversies. Yeah. You're a colleague, Adam, because he's the one that writes about radio, which you're supposed to be doing Tom, radio and TV, but Josie's the one that's owns the radio over there to Sun Sentinel. And a proof is in the next sentence. Manic Larry, full name Larry Buckley, was suspended and fired by WIOD AM-610. Is that correct? No, no, no. Then fired by WIOD AM-610. No, no. For stainless steel, uproved Daniels mess. Meanwhile, she remains on the ear. Don't blame ratings in this case, she hasn't done it. How do you like that for a little dick there, Brook? He says, don't blame your ratings because you don't have it. Pretty much the same situation pertains to WIOD AM or promotions director Sam Duke took the fall for the hostility generated by OJs apparently, well-convenited appearance at a charity golf tournament. There's superior here comes the best part, or Tom redeems himself for screwing up on what station at Bitsworth's shop. The superior who's signed off on bringing in OJ and then alerted the media to get maximum publicity for the station skated. Of such episodes that were of allusians spawned. So Tom, Jika. How do you like that? Of such episodes that were of allusians spawned. Do we have a revolution going on here? No, are we going to have one? No, no. But that's an interesting thought, Tom. Let's have a goddamn revolution, a QA. Let's all walk out. Come on, I'll be first and I'll look over my shoulder. Anybody following? No, no. Okay, so that I think I've changed my mind. Very quick and very silent and very short revolution. Here's Hollywood, hello. Hollywood. Yes, sir. Are you done? Okay. I have some information here for you on national airlines. What is flying to Vegas? Yeah. They begin service on January 27th. What year? Next year, 2000. They'll be flying 757 aircraft. Yeah. Two flights a day out of Miami. One of the eights, 15 in the morning, one at 940 in the evening. I hope it's your a 10th of early. Well, it's a very good start of them. I mean, to keep announcing their start. They're taking you money for tickets now. They have a full page at USA today. Really? Well, that's where I get the information and all that. 278 for coach round true. Oh, that's the 278 for coach 1198 first class. That's great. Yeah, that's not a bad problem. Do you know that American Airlines wants to soak you $2500. And that, of course, is with a stop in Dallas, $2500 first class from Miami to Vegas. Really? Yes, really. 2500 bucks. Can you imagine a good time to get out there with that? Yeah. That's what they're advertising now. I guess I want to get some money in the bank before this drop of service. That's all it's going to be. Two flights a day. You'd have to go eat. What's going with that? There's nothing wrong with it. It's 18 to arrive at 10 25. That's perfect. Yeah, it's the night flight is 940 and 1150 arrival. Right. I don't have to return. That's good. Yeah, the 27th. Thanks for the good news. Okay, sir. Thanks. There you go. National Airlines baby. I don't want this damn America worst. That's what it goes without saying. And no more of these damn stopovers in Atlanta over Dallas and seven hours to get there. 560, 505, 50, 50, pound five 60 on the AT&T line. Here's a call from Lake Worth. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Okay. Yeah, now you're talking about golf not the inner sport did you by chance see that fox That's fishing yesterday. Oh, can't wait. I heard Pat Summer on John Madden talking about. I thought they were joking. No, yeah. You thought you're watching like a skid on certain night live. They were interviewing a guy's live, casting her lines and all right. They kept rey. Don't forget folks we got the all excited way in coming in. And I had like a countdown to the way in and I just thought it. Get your comments on that. Do the. Have a good day. Thanks. Thanks for the good news. That's fishing there you go. Yeah, golf fishing, privilege or Florida baby. All these different activities people do when they're really bored to death. And what better place to be bored to death than here in Florida. Yeah. I wonder if they were using a treble hook or like a what kind of a lure they were using. Maybe we better check with deep throat. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T line. Here's Kindle. Hello. Yes sir. Neil happy be late. Thanks sir. First all power. I want to start 7. I'll take care of that part of the finger. Secondly, O.J. O.J. My level. And thirdly. I'm not few Neil. Oh boy. How's that? How very, very, very, very, very extremely extraordinarily sad. 560 pound 560 on the AT&T line. We just keep rolling along man. We just keep rolling right along. Waiting to let the two hits the whatever that thing is the big head hits the 12 and the little hand hits the two. Here's a mobile and thank cloud. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Are you doing pretty good? I was just thinking in reference to a photo of a injury. I've seen the newest Nike commercial. They're the, they are the, you are so beautiful going on and the old people with injuries and one hand. And then I'm looking in the last show that they show is Ronnie Lot. And he's got a tent up on the space and the first saw saw that I forgot what a injury was. And then the second time I look and I remember that his, again, the pinky is gone. He cut the end of his pinky off. So he could finish the Super Bowl game. And here's a hockey player that won't play with it. You know, broken or whatever. Chop that baby right off. Chop it off. I mean, I mean, that's, that's, and that's from the girls and he's, that's not even hockey. I don't know. Maybe there's something wrong here, man. When you see, when you, if you know anything about hockey and you see all these guys that had these incredible injuries and still are able to go and another part of the problem is this organization is so terrified that they're going to make a mistake. And they're going to put it back in their force and they're going back in their, they're going to go back in their, we're allowing to go back in their two soon. And then he's going to be out for another two months. They're terrified. They're petrified and they've been treating him like a china doll ever since they got here. They must be with an injury like that. They're holding them out. Like it's a groin injury like a, if I'm paying somebody $10 million a year for five years, they'd then well, better put out if they can stand up. I don't get it. I don't know. Maybe he's, you know, he's this that talent level where, you know, he's not a hit player. He's not a physical player. He's always just out. So like skate around everybody. I don't know. The physical thing. You must have a problem with it. Okay. the fourth. Go for it. junglers. Now the post depends on you and the powers you throw down. Today we fly with your life, he's got a god for you to do. You have a brand new style too. We love the way you fuck your doom with the big thing on your chest and the boot in my chest. You have to do it. Who's with the speed of fuck yourself? And the bad guy's straight to hell. When a building starts to fall, we throw the little bit of the needle. You're going to throw the little bit of the needle. And it calls the next thing, not a yet on his things. No. I'm a 32 of five, 62 of the two. And that New York Times spot was kind of interesting. You're not really fat. It's just to yourself images got a problem. What's not what it is? Just think about it and you'll be skinny by midnight. I'm looking down here. I'm looking down. I see a big, big role of fat. Yeah, that's myself. And it's all I will say this. When I was in Sarasota, 1973, I reached an all-time high 266 pounds. Yeah, I was just enormous. 266. And you know something I never paid any attention. People, I don't know who was just me or maybe all really, really enormous obese people. They just start looking us to it. And maybe when we get older, like more in recent years, I look at that mirror and I go, Yeah, Jesus Christ. Yeah. In the morning, you have to step out of the shower, start naked as a jabberd. And you're looking at mirror and you go, ah, fat. But I guess back in those days, maybe I just didn't have a big mirror. I mean, that's a good idea for all you fat people out there. Just don't have a big mirror in a bat room or any place else. Do like Dracula, just break all the mirrors. Yeah, somebody had you murdered some smash. It's like, oh, no. Not for me, I can't have a thing. It's called a public, a big, gigantic, it must be. Because I see some of these people who, I mean, just can't even bottle. They can barely even move. You know what I'm talking about? Like at the hockey games. And you wonder how in the world could anybody get a huge fat ass like that in one of those teeny little skinny seats? Maybe they just have a self-immig's problem. If they were just sitting and thinking about meditative, we'll find out at producer night. Here's Fort Myers, hello. Fort Myers. Yeah, hi, Neil. Hi, I'm Taylor. Okay, sure. Hey, listen, I'm a fat guy and believe me, I got no mirrors in my, uh, good, my house. Uh, first of all, um, yes. Yes, sir? Oh, okay. Never mind. Bye. Joe is on the floor. I'm on my hands and knees ready to say a prayer ready to rub my rosary beads ready to do a stigma to on my wrist on the palms of my hands. It's going to be like this again this weekend at the home. Yeah. It's part of that birthday celebrate. It's part of that ongoing yearly thing. Like a curse. It's the curse of Neil's what it is. I told you last weekend, it's the truth. Every year at this time. It's like a living hell. It's like a walking living and breathing. This guy calls, we're paying for the line. This is our famous not a time like that I screamed and I Howard and I carried on like a lunatic. We got we're on a year and four miars for Christ's sake. Plus we got all these people on the internet, but at least for Christ's sake for four miars. And how about Palm Beach? And so here's a guy calls from four miars. He gets on a year like, oh, never mind. And then. And then. That evil sound. Yeah. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I like I said before today is the eighth Wednesday will be the tenth. It's payday. That's what it's been reduced to. I hate to say that. I'll be very honest with it. That's what it's been reduced to because I got this for 23 years of pleading and begging and whipping people to have an opinion about anything to say something. Anything. It's getting stale man. It's getting old. I'm getting old, but not nearly as old as this. Yeah. God. But that was a classic. That was simulating man. That was special. That's what four miars had to say. What do they have to say today? Hey, Neil. This is Randy West. That you can't tell the difference between me and Ron Jeremy. You should try girls. Yeah. That's what they have to say. Speaking of fat Ron Jeremy. Is there anybody wants to see Ron Jeremy naked? No. Now, see I don't understand that whole thing. If he wasn't good buddies with Al Goldstein, he'd never got in the business in the first place. I'm sure that. Maybe he was like servicing Al. That must have been it. Because while with any person in the right mind, want to see somebody who looks like that naked. Even Randy West is anybody want to see him naked? Oh God forbid. Here's Pompano. Hi, Neil. Yes sir. I got a great story about crossing and sporting events. There's story goes that Al had co-cell and Ichpissure tree was sitting in the front row with the blocking bars. And if the ring jumps one of these Spanish guys, it's down in the stands and these give themselves the big cross. And Al had looks at the Ichpissure. But it says that Al. And the Ichpissure says only if he has a good left to look. Yeah. I thought it was a slightly amusing. Yeah. That's about it. Okay. Thank you. Okay. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line and out of town line including four miles by the way. Where they're loaded today. It's over two. 877, 785, Neil. 877, 785, 6345 and we've been paying for it. Maybe that dial call back. Maybe he'll butcher up a little bit. Yeah. He did call back. What do you say? He said someone came into the room. Yeah. He had naked, please. Somebody came into the room and he had a leave. Okay. Do we believe that? No. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. You got sticking with bluff Lindsey disease. Yes sir. Yes. Why in there? Yes sounds like you. Okay. I've been in my newspaper today and I looked at it and it's closed on the. Local section. Juice. Love. South Florida sunshine. This newspaper is trash. Yeah. This really. Don't be afraid. Get away for golf loving O.J. and his kids. They just can't stop beating us overhead with this murdering son of a bitch. Right. I mean, very much with the technique of posing for photograph with some. Mugulating his child. These people love him. You know, other than Kendall. This guy might just move into like a unity. And I don't like this to happen. And this is this loose tape on your just like just. Just a close deal. Well, don't forget, Channel 7's going to have him on the inside edition or whatever. All of this that they're promoting on O.J. They're going to have him on again. We just think well, not leave us alone with him. He's like a weapon and they keep beating us over the head with him. They keep placing us to pieces with him. It just embarrasses me. It's the verses we need to live in this community. No. And to see our newspaper. Just adore him. And I'm not going to let you know. See, it's all over. Like I said before, it's like Dennis Rodman and Bobby Brown. There it's another scumbag at him to the list. Scumbags that we just can't get enough of. I know. In the poppy brain, he's a potato chip. You should sit next to gentle green on the side line. Okay. Thanks. Put where your head fell. I was yeah. A gentle green doing by the way. Anybody seen him play like that? No. 560 50 560, pound 560 on the 18T line. Nice touch down there. By the way, on an intersection. I'm sorry. Just nitpicking again.

Oh, what if it's all about inquiring Catholics want to know? No. Here's the facts that I think tells it all. From Carlos R. Neo, you should have heard the mad dog yesterday. He talked about Pawel Brewery a lot. He said the guy should have a D&A test. To see if he's a man or a woman and a lot more. Pawel, you should have a D&A test. Nice going Carlos. He's like the guy who saw the Titanic victory on a front of the sports thing and thought the Titans won. A little better night school. We're not doing a good job out there. Oh, wait a little better job there. A night school might help. I think I'm going to go get a D&A test. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. Here's Pembroke Pines. Neo. Yes sir. Your first person to talk about the stigma. There is on Channel 7. Yeah. Going to be a whole story down our probably. Like, Sanchez probably filming with the mouth waiting to tell about that or whoever's going to do it. Can you be the one to poke the holes in his hands, though please? Sure. Oh, yeah. Yeah, make it like Swiss cheese if you like it. Okay. But they're going to do the story on Channel 7. It's going to be the night I believe. Just for information. You might want to catch it. Yeah. That's all I want to tell you. Okay. Thanks. I thought he was going to explain the stigma and tell us what it was all about. Molly's fairy tales. Was he going to do that? No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm going to tell you what the plan is show today. After a month after a month after a month or a year after a year after a year. Don't you think that's a reasonable question to us, especially all the Hispanics out there. They're all Catholic. And you even a Catholic like you didn't know what that was. And they have been a big thing about it now for whatever reason. It's making a big comeback. Maybe they're a bunch of people with bloody hands out there, like especially the people of the Vatican. They got a lot of blood on their hands. Very reasonable questions. Do I get a response? No. Twenty-three years have been doing that. And then at one moment calls me, says, oh yes, there's a lot of very bright people. A lot of good colors on it. Well, I got news for it. They've all vanished. They've all vanished. Except for Carlos R who's getting a DNA test right now. And a guy in four mires. That was a good call. Well, somebody came in the room. Yeah, somebody came in the room. They probably was too embarrassed to let them fight. He was calling on his show. That's probably what the problem was because he's over in four mires. And they probably give them a little stigma right on the hand. And maybe on the head. Call on that flag in Miami from Fort Myers over there. So I really appreciate the position you're in, sir. Probably prone. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Anyhow, you're doing it? Okay, sir. Neil, guys, I want to say the game last night. After the dolphin score, just second touch on it. I decided to go downstairs. He was sitting in a drink. And then before that, I wanted to be line to the restroom. I'm going to ask you, sir. I have a seat of the pop of pimple on my ass.

I started with the right after I leave Colors out of my blender. Strip clubs again. I don't think Ken Jenney's going to have time to be right now. Apparently on New Jersey or 90s consider running for the strong mayor in broad economy. I didn't hear any of your colors. I'm not chanting that. I thought maybe that would be good. I'm not mentioning why. But he can say or run for the... That's not news. I talked about that two months ago. I mean, that's what he's wanted. Month ago, I talked more than two, three, four months ago. Yeah, it's time to pack up and move. And it's... He hasn't got a chance in hell. Now, all the early polls he's going to win is... What do you want to think he's been doing all that? Pandery. You think he's going to be the Rudy Giuliani of Howard County and the public are saying, Oh, get that out of here. You both had a geek with a 180 party. Oh, he's a pacy face. Look at those. You get a good look at them. Oh, my God. Careful. I'm along with the... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... The... I'm listening, sir. I know what's shocking. I'm still here. Oh, you're still there. I'm sorry. You know, I... I usually get some static in there. And I didn't hear anything. I'm still here, sir. That's a vital terminal. 56050560, pound-560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. As we continue the search, the 23-year search ongoing. Somebody out there, somebody with something to say, something worthwhile, something interesting, something amusing, something perplexing, something profound, something... Anything. Something like... Eeeeh... That. Here's Candle, hello. Yes, sir. This woman says, give me some proof on who killed her. Woman posing with OJ. Yeah. I think OJ is the bomb. I think it's all he's got, people. People like this woman. What does that mean give me some proof on who killed her? Well, evidently, she must have missed the trial, I guess. I mean, she should be... She must have missed the DNA evidence. I'll leave the street. Uh-huh. Did you prove for that to... Okay, thanks. 560, pound-560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's Orlando. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Let's hope I get through this call. I have a couple questions. There are some of my brains up lots of eggs. I got to talk about it. The gentleman that called earlier with the information on national airlines. Are they going to be just out of Miami or do you know? Well, they're already flying out of some other markets. I don't know where. I just went to Vegas, the first of August. And I thought I might share when you come up first class. Because I've never had the opportunity to ride in that. Is it that expensive to go first class? Well, you're like, you're all into the... 20, 500 dollars. In American, yeah. Holy crap. Well, you think I just, if you were listening, the guy said it was like 280, I think in coach. And 1100 something in the first class. Well, I was in the money, but it's the less than half of American wants to soak it. Right now, out of Orlando, they have all the airlines. Delta, America West. I think Americans in their team. It's like round trip is 2012. You know, they do the Vegas. In coach, yeah. Yeah. We went and got a package. You don't like doing the all-in-one very inclusive thing to you. No. Why can I both want to take 972, take six days of money, call it, and it's round trip there. There's a medical West. It wasn't really bad. I wouldn't do America West if they paid me a thousand dollars. I would not fly in an airliner. There is no way in hell. I'll ever fly in America West again. Ever. Don't you have an head best out of Miami? Is that what the plane is to use other air? Well, they do now. They never use those before. They're now using the air bus, but they still, I just keep hearing one horror story after another. I hear no good stories about America worst. Well, I've been Vegas twice. Once Delta, once America left, and believe it or not, America West was better for me anyway. Yeah. Next question is, how close can I get Orlando to pick up one of your CDs? On each? Yeah, Palm Beach, West Palm. Oh, boy. Well, it says. Are you, or are you, or are you just ordered off the website? The mail will not be. Just near roggies.com if you have a computer. Yeah, I do. I have a super radio. I was Joe Jackson when I came on. Was I listening on the net or the radio? Hmm hmm. Why do you both day I was working in a consuming. And I must have a radio on speaking out if you're good there. But I use the computer. Near roggies.com, and you order right off of there. I thank you, buddy. And thank you. Bye, bye. 560, 505, 60, Palm 560 on the AT&T line. 777-785-Neal. 877-785-6345. Here's a mobile-in-4-laternal. Hello. Near roggies. We're moving in the spik mod. Yeah. Yeah. Here's a mobile-in-davy.

Yeah. He's not sticking to any more. He's stuck him in the ground. Actually, the truth of the stigmata is that they don't stick it through their hands. They stick it through their wrists. That's how the rummits actually cruise the bottom. Through the wrist. Maybe that's why he had such a limp wrist. Yeah. All right, thanks. Thanks for the good news.

No. No. No. God. That was good. He was almost as good as the N4MIR. That's not quite. 560-50560 on the AT&T Line. Hello. I would describe Stigma as a Goulish Catholic Parlor trick. When the Catholic religion is loaded with these kinds of things, if you're a trans-transpansiation, the belief that the host and the wine turns into the flesh and blood, essentially that it's cannibalism. It's a process cannibalism. And that business about to give the way for you to eat and crush them. Really believe it is. The hard core Catholic is a flesh and flesh. And if you don't know about them when they cannibalize saints, they actually assume their corpse is, and then cut them up in little pieces and turn them into relics. Oh, right. So, you know, if you believe in this Saint, you're going to walk around a little crucifixion. I would like to talk about your really sick bastard's domain man. I would have to agree. God bless you. God bless you, too, new. I'll pray for your soul. Okay. 26 after noted, 560-50-50-50-50-50-50-50-50. I'd like to talk about your really sick crap, and nobody would have brain-curdably because what it sounds like to me. 560-50-50-50-50-50-50 on the AT&T line, 877-785-Neal on the Florida line, 877-785-6345. I'll get a little tired of that crap. I can tell you right now. January has pulled me a month. I would better wait to celebrate them with a good hot album. It's the greatest hint of all and oatmeal. You'll get songs like, it's a sick rule. It's a sick rule. It's a very wild answer. I'm sure of it, so you know what's that, clue? They do. They do. They follow me. You can throw a lot of stays for the earth. They follow me. It'll hang while I'll pay for it. You'll also get hit like, you will have that lumpy feeling. She's gone for another bowl. And Danny, that's the greatest hint of all and oatmeal. A hearty way to start your day. It's 1232-50-50-50-50-50-50. Thanks to our good buddies at Atlantic City Subtune, all the way to the real lunch today. Great stuff. One thing about this joy, may not get angry at cause, but you should get a good three lunch every day. Oh! Spanish radio play for pay alleged. Lay into those hotels. The better late than the four-year later, the discovered payola. Oh! Yeah. Programmers who handle playlists for 100 or more Spanish language music stations are suspected of taking record-competitive rives of up to $700,000 to play songs sources to hold the AP last week. Federal officials have launched a new inquiry to the charges following a two-year payola investigation of phono-VC Incorporated. The nation's largest Spanish language music label, which admitted paying up to a million dollars to programmers. Phono-VC artists monopolize the top three positions on Billboard magazine, Latin Airplay, chart for the first five months in 1997. And regularly took about 14 of the top 40 slots. After the alleged drive stopped, phono-VC's presence on the Billboard Hot Latin track charts failed by half. Much to just been a coincidence, artists from the record label are putting such singers at the M.V. G. Iglesias and Marco Antonio Slees, but no specific artist have been named in the payroll investigation. How do you like that? 40 years after a WMGM in New York and our Allen Frieden Philadelphia, all those guys went to jail. The Spick's finally uncovered in the discovered payola. Oh! That's gone, boys. Here's a mobile in West Palm, hello. Hey, no, you've been talking about the dolphins. What does that mean? Sports illustrator predicted that they're going to the Super Bowl. Yeah. And they're going to win. And the real question is, is it Danny or Damon? Meaning what? Meaning with Damon Duret in their defenses are caught off guard now. We've got a whole new run game in the quarterback. They've got a running game? Yeah. Watch the game last night? Not, honestly. Okay, thanks. I'm sure you couldn't have watched your run in the game. If you thought they were running, sure you're an idiot. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. There's another great soft photo sports fan who's on top of it. He's on top of it. He's slept through it, which I couldn't blame him for, by the way. Here's a call in Davy. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I was not about the dolphin game. One of the commercials in there. I'll come to France and run an ad on a naturally qualified game. QAM can promote you or anybody else on television. Ask these people. Ask these bastards. Okay. They only made $35,000 through your last year. Yes, sir. Okay. Just couldn't believe that. Believe it. If you saw 60 minutes last night, the FDA improving that you're, that it's no big deal that they can recycle the hard monitors and the ad you open last season put them in somebody else's body. Sure. They don't give a crap. You got a pay full price for that. They don't give a crap, but cigarettes are bad. I don't forget that tobacco kills. Just remember that. We're suing everybody in sight. Yeah, you make my day go smooth like it's never going to come. Well, you better count today's pal because I think that this whole act will come at a little end real fast here, man. Based on this last few days here, I think this is a more run out of steam here. Work our history. The second best go have to be your tapes and shorts won't be on there once you're gone. So, you know, I got plenty of years of you. Okay. Have a great day. Yeah, they're going to be playing my tapes when I leave. How do you like that? They're going to be playing my tapes? No. No. It's all over. Maybe the party is over so many times in these last 23 years. I've 23 and a half years. 23 almost 24 years. But now you can smell it. It's so thick in a year. You could cut it with your goddamn little toe. Pushing and pulling and squeezing and yanking and beating and whipping. And the best you can get the best response you can get is all of those more silenced. Of course, I either got a running game now, but I fell asleep last night. Okay. There you go. How about Pablo Varray? How's he doing by the way? I say, let's slice the finger off, Pablo. Then I won't hurt no more. Okay.

It is a medical condition. And it's kind of brought on like when people bring on their own. Also, if they believe hard enough, they actually reach blood through the sweat pours. Really? Yeah. But it's not real. If you get my drift. Not given. By the way, I was a coffee stain of Jesus on my table. And I'm turning my business into a church. All right. I'm getting a tax break. Okay. I'll see you on the 13th. But it's also open. Okay. Oh, my God. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. Here's a call from Melbourne. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir.

First off, I apologize for the fact that Miami is surrounding you by idiots. Oh, it's recent. It's an epidemic now. It's like an epidemic situation we got. I've listened to you recently. I've been down for a couple of years. I did my postgraduate work. I'm staying because my fiance's going to go buy and get her my afters. Although I think I'm really soon moving back to America and I was, I was, I was, I was one day I, I purchased stuff. You'd talk about education before. I've been around town. I teach now at a local college. Which I'm not going to name. But I have these people. I don't know restaurants and you know, I have applied for teaching jobs. I teach music. So I was going to teach her this thing and you go to houses and teach kids from Instruments. And then they told me my Spanish wasn't good enough in broken English. Which is real nine. Oh, and you know, I hear people talk about the dolphins. I'm not a sports fan. And I, you know, but I can, if you're in the sports, I know you're in the hockey. I hear that, you know, all of these stands are a piece of crap down here. Anyway, for whatever the listening to music sports doesn't matter. But if it's saying it's time, these people talk about a bunch of crap on the radio. Why and about what they're going to go to a club. Why my amuse at winning. Why why marinos doing this. And the same time I teach a college. I get a bunch of papers in from these same kids that are talking to a bunch of this crap. And they can't even string four sentences together. You know, I do anything like a V&A test. I don't know what it is. But these these people are a bunch of morons. I mean, I, I, you've got to have some, you've got it. It really is. I can take it personally if I wanted to, but I'm not an idiot. You know, I got a pretty good sense of humor. I got an IQ of large and then I found that. And I'm just surrounded in the town where the average IQ is in a minus column. That's all. Nothing I can do about it. I can do the first time. I enjoy listening to Neil, you're your highly intelligent and visual. And I have a great time listening. And don't worry. When, when's these payday? Just, uh, thank you for that. Have a great day, pal. Thank you. That's right. When's these a 10 to no member? It's another payday. The only reason I'm here. Not less me. Not less America. Four minutes to one a Q.A.M. This is five, 60 Q.A.L. Only one South Florida radio station has a hammer. Hey, hey, hey, hey. We still have the minutes of two. Sports radio 560 Q.A.L.M. Hey, stop it. WCWM. My head, good body day. Worked a bomb two two hours. Hi, babe. Coach, you love Bill Bradley. Don't be neat, Bill Bradley. He is the first to be called. I was with Rebecca Paul. All right. So she loved Bill Bradley. Yeah, we need him badly. He's gonna win the race. People love him cause he is the now-reador. Did I mention that he is the now-reador? He played for the day. He doesn't borrow this. Yeah, we love him cause he is the now-reador. Not alcohol. Not alcohol. Not alcohol. Yeah, he's not alcohol. I say it one time, boy. We love Bill O'Rogor. But because he's not boring, now-reador. Well, don't you love Bill Bradley. You don't do it five, six, six, six. You don't love Bill Bradley. This is what happens when you got into the tan. He was in auto-reaching. Like Mary O'I'm dreading, okay? He knows nothing else. He probably don't even know what a positive or a rule. Seriously, you don't know anything about Italy. You don't know anything about Catholicism. All you know is auto-reaching. And a goddamn Yankees. Which congratulations by the way. But nevertheless, thank you. Seriously, I'll lend him a mary. How could anybody say he's not a tan? I mean, I mean, there is for you. I mean, it would be one thing if you were like Polish. But you were a tan. Yeah. And he's a tan. Don't be like my son. All Milton Burl wasn't Jewish. Or isn't there whatever it is he's still alive. He's not. What? Jewish? Milton Burl. Okay. Milton Burl's not Jewish. And Marilyn always not dead. And Ronald Reagan does not have Alzheimer's. And Nancy Reagan doesn't wear a red dress. The fact that Nancy Reagan is the devil with a blue dress on. How do you like that? Or was that Monica? One of the other. He's a tan and God damn it. Why I had heard some, he heard what? You see, this is what happens when you start spreading bad rumors. He's a thing always a wap. He's a guinea. Okay. He's a satin. He's a good writer. He's a good writer. And nobody in this audience, all these sports nerds on his radio who call his God damn stupid as sports station. Danny, this, and Damon, that, and Jimmy, there's the only reason that they're even in the goddamn running much less leading to division is a little more. A little more. Yeah. There's the guy right there. A little while. Yeah. He scored 95% of their points already. He said that one great return for the interception of touchdown last night. Didn't he run it all the way? No. No. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. There you are. How are you doing? Okay, sir. You got a great show. Let me just tie you. I moved here from LA a few months ago. I listened to talk show the long time. Yeah. Even if you didn't have one call, it would be a fantastic show. There's nothing. Everybody all over the world. They're, you know, come down here and, oh, you're the greatest thing we ever heard in our lives. Other people in the business. And yet every day of my life here is like the first day that I'm on a year in his town. These are the most ungiving, unyielding, unbending, goddamn people. They will give you nothing. And all they want is you to give them something for free. That's all they want. They're about your free loaders. Well, I think first of all, just a talent like it is. I mean, it's just hilarious. I enjoy it every day. But here's my main point. And I thank you for bringing up hockey because nobody talks about that. They would know a hockey puck from a goddamn lenders bagel. I've been a fanatic for 32 years. Let me tell you something. I watch this team. Buries not to think. People should stop talking about Burie. This team has a bunch of prima donners with the steps that maybe five guys that hit anybody. Yeah. You guys got six five guys like Kaislaq Kavashia, Mike Wilson. These guys, the go into the course. They should go into the corner with an egg in their pocket. They wouldn't come out the clap at all. That's right. This person is my pristine. These guys, they're going to send you the players on his team right now. Okay. Ray Whitney, you got Mark Parish. You got Trevor Kid. You got right head of kid when he's not suspended. And I'm trying to think of somebody else. Paul Laws. That's an assumption in the. That's it. And then Mel Mel and be what he's a head straight. And you know what went in hockey is not the fancy dance that the ice to pay. You need hard work and team. And this team, until they get rid of a lot of these free loaders like at the border I couldn't touch anybody. Yeah. They've done other stuff. I mean, just pathetic. So it's not Barry Barry when he's in that fight. But what you're missing is this point. And that is this. For example, Atlanta's going to be on Wednesday and expansion team. I grow testing. Nobody hears those. The Atlanta thrashes from the trash. Okay. They have no idea. So if you're going to try to get people to come out. You've got to got it's making $10 million a year. Who for my money is still the most exciting. Not the best player. That's the younger. But the most exciting player in the world. And he's healthy. But he's got to get healthy sometime. You know, I agree with that. But you know what? The thing that really brings people out is a winning hard work and team. And you know, when I go to these games, if you lose, you lose. But I want to go down fight. And I want to be a hard work. When I feel that game Saturday night with nobody else. I wouldn't drop as close with somebody. And no one has to get it. My game is kind. They have it. They won the game six to three. They won the game. They won the game. They grew old. I understand that. But they got too many guys on this team. They're not carried through tight guy. Yeah. That's what I change is this team is going to stay average and pass. And I just want to say that. It's not blurry. It's these other players that won't put out. That's the problem. Yeah. Nothing worse than a guy that won't put out. Yeah. You know, having a great day. Thanks. They all like that. Let's get hockey intensive. Maybe. There's a lot of water. Why don't we have a backhand went line of the goal. For our crack. Fristive takes us proud of the point. No. There's an act. What a clock. We need to see you all covered in backhand. That's the power. The power. The me three. Rifted on the power. Why? The forward. The thing. His second goal of the game is. He's hurt. I mean, I realize your opponent know. Jigs McDonald, you know. But he still makes a heroized on a backhand. I'll tell you that. That's one of the problems we got in here is these radio broadcast. I'm sorry. 560, 50560, 560 on the AT&T line. Things that are meaningful. Things that are important like hockey. These people don't know from. They don't care about it. They don't want to learn about it. They know nothing. The saddest day of my life was that I gave those guys in. Ticket to way. And it grew cold in. And I was given. Remember asking the numbers of different players. I mean, about like, yager. What not? I had a. I had a Sunday. I had a Steve Eisenman. I don't know. And she's got a reading of the hockey news, which I at least congratulated that somebody gave her a copy of the hockey news. Maybe she even bought it herself. Maybe she even prescribes to it. I think this town needs to be. And a test is what I think. God. She's got a read out of the goddamn. Rostors in a hockey news to be able to win a tickets. But at least like I said, she came in admitted to me in public at the arena. And I said, I want to take it back. Yeah. She was a big girl, too, by the way. Very nice, young lady, but she was big. They got up to beat the crap out of me. I'll tell you that. I want those tickets back. Yeah. She had a deep voice. Kind of like that hunchback. Nine minutes after when I still saw of set about that, I'll lend them our business. No, seriously. You know, it's like it would be like saying, just set me for a lot of a half like Randy for a lot of your people. He played on the Yankees. You'd tell the endfielder, give you some Yoman service. Tagan. George, you're already. George, we love you. So, Tory. Well, my grandmother. Tory was born in Brazil. So, Tory. But he's a top. Isn't Joe Tory a tie? Yeah. Don Zimmer. Don Zimmer is not a tie. But he's got that playton, sir, from Italy. Where's that? So he thinks he's a tie. Nine minutes after I love Don Zimmer. Love Popeye, baby. There's a guy. I don't like the Yankees, but I do love Popeye back to those Cubs days all those with the days. Those with the days, those great days with the cubs with Rhino, Rhine, Sandberg, and Mark Grace, and all those go in. There was great. Can't go back, you know. Like the pirates, like with Roberto Clemente and Harvey Hadix and Elroy face, Smokey Burgess, Rocky Nelson. You can't live a, that's when sports was something. What do you got today? You don't even have a cheeko carouscale today. What do you got today? What's your punks? A bunch of minor legers. A bunch of two tan hitting minor leg purps. Hitting against minor leg pitching, and it still hit in two ten. And by the way, Justin Thompson got traded the other day. You'll notice the four one guns, all as you see that. Maybe now Justin will finally regain his form from a couple of years ago, because maybe Texas will score him a few runs with those guy damn tigers never did. But you ever hear Justin Thompson speak? He'll fit in perfect in Texas. Y'all. And he's a hillbilly. Why are you talking about Justin Thompson? Is anybody here know who that is? No. I know who it is. Only one sub-floor to radio station has the hammer. And you are a little bit sick, so we can open it. We can have to do sports radio 560 QAF. So we're stuck radio out of her in my life and on WD. I'm not such a ranger to do that. I'm not such a ranger to do that. Some people seem there, no desire to kill her. If they get drugs, my eyes may have so much to call you. You say I'm the can of it, and your is much too fine. So I can see you. You have to have a line. Oh, right. Well, he's a best damn candidate. I don't care if he doesn't let a man go. We've had the inklet who was at the ticking mine. So here's good horse. He gave a line. I guess I'll just don't understand what they do even now. You've had many presidents like Elvis who does learn and sling her another. Like Gerald Warford since the start of the movie. He was on the ground. Otherwise, why would you call him that over there? And he was still up to one spell level. He didn't even know the robber just for the first day of my career. Why even went back to watch it? So I don't believe he only really knocked down the Jerry tree. He was because he has a luncheon. So I'm sorry to buy you. Oh, my God. Can you believe this? Wow. I'm just opening today's mail such as it is. Rabbi Sam Silver. Wait, does he have a lot of cuts back? Oh, my God. Talk about a professional old-ju guest. Try to pawn himself onto this show. Are you out of your mind, Sam? Are you nuts? Oh, God. Yeah, like I'm going to put Sam Silver on here. Oh, they're having a show like this every day of my life. And I have to Sam Silver on here, huh? Oh, he's been a little guest from the W. News days years ago that we used to have a cart that said, You might as to my regards to Neil Rogers. I never heard of a smudger show. Where is that cart? Come on, Mom, please. Maybe we still have it. One moment, please. Well, I don't know if it's in here. And he sees Hawk in me. Send me a goddamn thing. You want to be on a show. Are you out of your mind, Sam? Come on. You crazy old-ju? Go hot to your crap somewhere else, all right? Another professional guest. Another crummudgeon. Oh, this can't be another birthday card. Is it from Ted and Port Charlottes, Florida? Ted is 24 years old. Was this in the recent 1992 and he was 17. lived in Miami during his high school years. He said it was then by Anton and I found you on the dial at 610 W.I. Oh, he did that all this station. How do you like that? Thanks a lot, Ted and Port Charlottes. Here's a nice car from a young man in Port Charlottes. Send me a card. What did I have? Like seven or eight cards from here? I got a card from somebody in Port Charlottes. Shouldn't know on their lands through the infradity when it was birthday cards didn't come forward in here. That these people don't care enough. It's said they're very goddamn best. What a sad, sad, sorry, bunch of this town is baby. Go out there to publics the other day to anybody say, Hey, Neil, happy birthday. Oh, no. Not that I care. That's when you get to be an old fart like this. You want to keep counting. But just to be nice. Just to be nice. I realize it's not a little cabinet or this guy's in April town. But just to be nice. Just to put on an act for an old man. You know, hey, Neil, happy birthday. Even though we hate you like Port. You know, something like that. Oh, here's something that the Joel enjoy. More a sick, growth test portal here in the mail. You know, if you're going to send Porto, send something good. I have never seen so many ugly guys as this. Who wants to see an ugly, growth test guy with his big. I would have been a big. I'm going to see this. Oh, man. Give it to Carlos Hill again. A crap that comes in a mail in this place. This place is a joke. Really is into disgrace. 560560 on the AT&T line. Orlando, Mari's Italian baby. But you're life on it. Here's a mobile and pepper prime. Hello. That's a radio crank, though. Here's a mobile. Here's a mobile. Here's a mobile. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. I listen to your show now. I'm getting a good tip here. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I get it. I get it. Cranks it up again. He's squeezing himself. He's getting bored. There is. Good. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. Probably another spick. Oh, here's more than a more pornography. How do you like that? Or whatever the hell this is. More crap. Put somebody else on the mailing list. Okay. Send the Alice Rantella to West Coast. Get out of here with your goddamn portal crap. Oh, it's good. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, the IDone. Okay, sir. Well, okay. Happy birthday. I'm a good person. That's too late. It's already gone. Let's go. I'm crazy. Oh, I'm crazy. Oh, I'm going to have a positive. Here's Santa Bel. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yeah. I'm an expatriate American who lives in Italy. And I'm just visiting here. All right. And I just wanted to make a few times. I'm not going to apologize for these stupidity of our Americans. But nevertheless. Well, I came back here after a couple, you know, seven or eight years. And I can't believe the changes I've seen. Yeah. It's just, it's like a vapid torped banal existence of commercial nothingness. Right. Exactly. I mean, I've never seen anything quite this bad. But I mean, if Europeans, you know, they understand it. But it seems to me that Americans don't see the force for the trees. They don't. I actually tell them that. I keep telling them how civilized it is in Europe and how the people are right around shooting each other. And nobody has guns. And there's no this rampant violence. And the people are educated. And like in some of the countries, people speak five and six and seven languages, slowly and they're, you know, priorities, education and how many material things that they've got. And these people go, like that. They just don't care. They're brainwashed. Well, you know, I mean, after living, you know, when you live in places like Florence, right. And Rome, being on the view of Veneto, Correct. I mean, what more can you ask for? I mean, you got people that are like you said civilized. Yeah, there's an opportunity to make you want to go back to the Colosseum and, you know, and throw some Christian to the lions. Hey, listen, I got a little answer for you as far as pigma da. Yeah. If you ever been to Tuscany, I'm sure you have. Yes. There's a little area that you got to get to. It's up there a little town called Arreito, which is where my relatives are from. Arreito. Arreito. It's about 40 miles west of Florence and south. 40 miles west of Florence. Yeah, 40 miles west and south. Right. Now, if you go above there in the Aponines, which is just, you know, awesome territory, much prettier than Florida. I hate this, but it, I hate to say it, but it's all of it, at least pretty much. Unbelievable. And anyways, there's a little area. There's a little monastery called La Verna. And also one called Camoldoli. Now, that's where St. Francis had his court on court. St. Francis of Assisi. Yeah. Right. St. Francis of Assisi. So the deal is that if you're about to become a saint, you go down to some little. Yeah. Seller. Whatever. And they shoot you with this, you know, Star Trek deal. And well, you wanted to know what it was about. And that what it is. Yeah, they put the, they put the, a Pomodoro sauce on your hands. Yeah, and it's kind of like, you come on. I'm bleeding. I'm bleeding. It's an act of something. They're like Jim Kirk, a Star Trek. Right. Exactly. Just like that. Hey, have a good one. Thanks a lot, pal. You bet you. Are we the dirt you? 123 a QA M 5 6 70 50. Here's an incredible story. And this story, by the way, I especially want to dedicate to all those Sponey Red Wing fans out there who show up at the macaroon and every time the Red Wing's coming to the, with the Red Wing jerseys on. People that wouldn't know Southfield from Northfield. People that never won. God damn 12th of a 12th Street. People that wouldn't know the ambassador bridge from the ambassador to England. Members of Florida television crusade Red Wing's coach Scottie Bowman, Captain Steve Iserman and forward Marthanela point of views. I'm during a game in Tampa Bay last night. Nice going lightning, by the way. Watch that game. Which Detroit lost three to two. The Detroit Free Press reports today that Bowman shoved the camera man into a manager in yellow obscenities. Iserman tried to grab a camera during the third period of the Wing's treated to Los Angeles and a point threatened and spit. How do you like that for class? Spitted a camera man. The trouble began during the second animation after the Fetsman Chris Chelyos was penalized when 10 seconds left in the period, giving Tampa Bay a two man advantage. Bowman left the bench, walked down the tunnel toward the locker room, and accounted a camera crew that was setting up the interview associate coast Dave Lewis. Bowman allegedly pushed cameraman Richard Delaney, who fell in the stage manager Amy Confort, the camera struck a shoulder. Also, Delaney said Bowman just shoved me out of the way, but he didn't want to come in further. Activity was in Bowman's path. Delaney said I could have been. Confort said she was angry and planned to file a complaint. Also, we were just trying to do our job. Drone interview, one of the assistant coaches during the period breaks he said. He did it with enough force to feel the impact that he started yelling him. He wasn't a real happy person at that point. Lewis left the arena before reporters learned of the allegations. The trouble continued into the third period. After lightning scored twice to take a three to one lead at 201, Patrockey said he pointed his camera at Isaman and LePoids sitting directly on the bench. Patrockey was at an assignment station between the bench's shielded from players by Plexiglass. Isaman reached around a front of the glass to try to grab the lens and I backed up Patrockey said when I backed up, Isaman backed off and LePoids started on me, but Trocky told the newspaper that LePoids read it and saying, I'm coming over the glass. Squared, squared. So the next thing I know, Patrockey said he did his spitting routine. He was arching his spitting over the glass to try to get at me. Nice. Plastic job there, Scotty Bowman and Stevie Y and Martana Lepoint. Nice going. Of course you'd be pretty pissed off too if you lost to a girl's team in Tampa last night, three to two left to write wings. So all you phone is all you're front running phone is that quarter suck at the red wings ass every time they come to time. Take that and stick it right in your. Correct, oh yeah. Here's Miami. Hello. I don't. Okay. Just wondering if you saw the article in the Sun Sentinel yesterday, I know, charities lately have been a touchy subject with you. It's about the Denise Brown charity set up for Nicole Simpson. I talked about this. I've talked about this. Oh, did you? Okay. And they raise all this money and about two dollars is going to do the real charity. Yeah. I just did it really open my eyes a lot to what these charities are all about. I mean, you know, administrative fees, what does that mean? You've basically lived off the charity the right way. You're right. And they're pocket. That's right. Okay. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. 26 after one a QAM. I wouldn't spit on the best part of the road when he's heading like that. Yeah. That's for you, Stevie. That's you, Stevie.

And then you're going to cut out all the sugar and the starches. And if you're going to, like, also kind of cholesterol, what are you going to eat? What's left? What's left? The EAP side. Yeah, that's about it. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. 877, 785, Neil. Don't forget we'll be at specs in South Bay and the Gables. The Saturday noon to two with our best of stuff. Here's a mobile in Halendale. Hello. Hey, Neil. I do it. Okay, sir. Hey, listen. You see that thing about the church roof, Kevin? Yeah. You know, the first thing they did after the roof came, yeah. And what was that, sir? They wanted to play to God. Yeah. Neil, God. Walk your walkaways, roof falls. 23, you heard in the Alta Monster Springs. A lot of bad things seem to be having an insurance lately. You notice? Yeah, well, you know, thank God. Okay. That's good. God's busy with the NFL. He's busy with those NFL games. In fact, you notice another new thing. You'll even see the end of the Bears Packers game. Because the field goal kicker for the Bears had missed a chip shot field goal, which would have given him a bigger lead. And so then the kid for the Packers comes out there with a chip shot. It looks like the Bears are going to blow another one. And the kicker is blocked. And the kicker for the Bears is going like this. He's looking up at the sky. And they shoot a couple other highlights. And after these guys make the great catch, or they score the touchdown, they're looking up in the sky. Like something, maybe a pigeon up there had something to do with it. What is it up there in the sky that caused them to win a guy to end game? Did God have something to do with that? Did God force that field goal to be blocked? Is that what it was? He's just crying. They're crossing themselves. They're looking up at his sky. Like if there's a guy. He's worried about guy named sports. My god, listen to QA and the one who's, the one who had six bad weather lately. You know, he must be pretty pissed off. Hey, a god. Let me ask you. What's your take on that sterling heights? Dearborn, Janus weekend. God. 560560, on the AT&T line and 877-875 Neal on the Florida line. Boy, I can't wait.
