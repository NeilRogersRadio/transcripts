Neil Rodgers on Sports Radio 560, QA-Boward. The supplies present. Members of the 100th Congress, distinguished guests, and I felt a little Americans. I have a incomprehensibly large tool. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. You can't touch me. Please, come in the groin. Mr. Harrow, he's just in skill he snores. Hello. I'm Bernie Co. Fel, and I'm barely alive. But I don't snore in tears why. When we go to sleep, my wife always carries her anti-smorgun. Not only is it easy for her to use, but it's very effective too. And here's why. Just one quick pull of the trigger and you'll sleep snore free all night long. All right. If you have a loved one that snores, use the anti-smorgun. Just with the NRA ordered. To order yours. Have credit cards ready and call the NRA at 1-800 of American ways. It's said I wanted 560 WQAM happy Tuesday to you. Got a great facts here. Unlike the facts we had yesterday, although it doesn't make reference to it, it would be an interesting thing to read. But it's written by Dave Barry, so will I read it? No. It's a little twerp. But it's about the beast room you'll on the airplane. Nice going, you're a Cheryl. Some Cheryl out there, not the Cheryl that we used to be our friend over there at the Cox. But at any rate, some other Cheryl, who says PSM, a 40-year-old lady, I was too late for Backstreet Boys to get enjoy. F blank blank, blank, Sherry. Tom Green for May or Miami. Nice going, Cheryl. Here's the lady who don't want anything. Unlike that bitch yesterday. By the way, didn't hear yesterday. If you missed the beginning of the show, I should read that again. Oh, Sherry up there in Volca, another free loading bitch. Another free loading bitch. Can you get me some, and by the way, speaking of freebies, free stuff. Where is Fatboy? Where would my guy damn dolphin to get to the parking pass that he was off to see Ray Perry for yesterday? Oh, I'll be right back, pal. Right back, pal. He wants to get lost in highly unaware something. With Willie in the hand-gives. God, what these people around here, man. I want to tell you before anything else today. The most irresponsible, the blackest mark in the history of television. Who do you think it was, by the way? I'm out of do talk, Sherry. Yeah. Which ordinarily, the only thing I do is I channel surf and believe me. This time of the year there's a lot of surfing going on. Even Jan Barry would be surfing if he could. But he can't. That's head about Jan Barry. Well, he couldn't surf if you saw it now. The thought of Jan Barry out of surfboard. I think is a little pathetic. But so I'll see who he's got on here and sometimes for a comic relief or sometimes out of amazement, I just couldn't turn it off. I kept flipping back to it last night because I kept making it myself even at Larry at some point here. Some point is going to get up and say, you know, you're full of crap David, I'm getting out of here. This is ridiculous. Did you do that? No. David Berkelitz, the son of Sam, which by the way, Spike Lee, lays the biggest egg in the history of human race. They yanked that before cutting the theaters day yanked in the movie too. That's how bad it was. The son of Sam. And what have I told you for years, this man with a longest tongue in history, he if he could bring back Hitler from the grave, he'd have him on or suck at his ass for an hour on worldwide TV. It's not bad enough that we're asking a US to be treated this to split, but all over the world. And by the way, speaking to you crazy people in the media, you know, those kids out there in Littleton, Colorado, with Columbine, I leave them to hell alone. We don't need to hear any updates. We don't need to see any more interviews. We don't need to see any cheerful parents, any fried fried frightened kids. Leave them alone. I know it's not your, you're not capable of doing it. You crazy people in the media. Just leave them alone. They'll go their back in school and life will go on. And they'll adjust if you leave them to hell alone. See, one thing that I want to criticize the goddamn people out there at school system, they should have said, the media's off limits. You're not allowed anywhere near our school campus. And if you don't understand that tough crap, get out of here. That's all. That would have solved the problem. But because we're in other one of those laws, we haven't had a mass murder in last couple of days. So now, but, you know, because the media will never let anything go. Once it's like a pit bull, once it gets its teeth on something, it takes an army to get it to let go. And that's the media. These poor kids out there, leave them to hell alone. And the parents too, you know, oh, you know, are you grieving? I mean, oh, Jesus Christ. No, we're not grieving. We're having a freaking party over here. Okay, we're having a bar mitzvah. Crazy people. But this thing with David Birkowitz last night, could I be the only person in this audience that's on? No, I sure hope not. Somebody needs to hold CNN accountable. Forget about Larry because he's not a countermeasure. He's not accountable. He can't help himself. He's not a control. He'll just any ass you put in front of his ugly posts in front of his hunchback body. He just, it's like a reflex action. You know, like a, like a, what are the, like a flight catcher? What are they call those things for the long tongue? A communion? A lizard, a frog. A frog. Man, yeah, for any of those. That's a tongue just automatically reaches out as soon as it sees a fly. And that's the way it is with Larry. As soon as he sees an ass, immediately that tongue goes darting out. I'm out of do talk. Kisses kissing and kissing and kissing. And of course David Virkel with now he's born again. He found Jesus. What a surprise huh? Well, he was in a slamer. He found Jesus. And no matter what Larry asked him during that hour, it all, well, my mind is blank on that. It was a very dark time in my mind. But I know the Lord forgives me and, uh, blah, blah, blah, blah. And Jesus says, and then the best part of the thing was, well, I know the audience wants to see you pray for us at the end of the show. We're going to say, or have you say a prayer? I'm thinking of myself, America should be saying a prayer for itself that this irresponsible scumbag assucker is on their worldwide TV for an hour every night doing these things. And it's unconscionable. I know how to do a talk. You know, forget about the fact that he screwed all these people down here and never paid the money back. That small potato. Don't need to stay down. No care to the crap that he's pulling over on the public. You know, you give a man an hour of worldwide television and say, do whatever you want. You know, make this little BDI Ross Piro in a way, uh, hero. A little guy who's a laughing stock who's a joke who's a third burger who says things that on their face are ludicrous, they're liable. Gotta roll up our sleeves and do, do, do. Dust off those old studies and just bring a back and bring a back and bring a back again and again and again. All is good friends, Benny, Hen. Jerry Fallwell, Reverend Robert Schuorth, Airby Faker, Airby Fony, Airby Lire, Airby's Con artist that ever came down to Pike. This man never met an ass that he didn't want to, he didn't want to look. It's just unbelievable. He said, yes, that must do it for you. David Berkel is the son of slam. And he's talking about, he's talking to the other murderers there in the slam or and he's, you know, trying to turn them on to Jesus and God and find a religion. And of course, you can just see this whole, you know, they all pull this crap. Because God is forgiven of so why can't society, you know, let's just put it behind us and let him out again because now he's a good Christian after all. Is there, and of course, why is this man alive? You know, because of the crappy laws in the state of New York, I love Maria Cuomo, although this was before his time, I believe, way before. But nevertheless, that was the one thing that he was so wrong on with the death penalty. Why are the, you know, if they would have fried his ass a long time ago and it should have been fried, the public around the world where they had to be treated to the spectacle last night, that was the most irresponsible, the worst hour in the history of television. What did we figure the guys, Namos, who invented the, uh, the, uh, tele, what was his name? Inventive the a picture tube. Oh, phylog, he phylog, he phylog, he phylog, he's rolling in his freaking grave. After seeing that crap last night. I mean, just, uh, and then to do it that I'm sure. Larry, you are the worst, the most irresponsible, the lowest form of sub-human scum on the face of the earth. You're just, uh, the only sister that was pathetic, pathetic. Is there anybody anxious enough that he wouldn't bring him on or had tossed those marshmallows? Is there anybody? No, no. Mowatzi tongue, he'd have him on there. Stalin, Hitler, uh, uh, you name it. There is nobody in the world that this man couldn't bring on if we could bring them back to life and suck their ass for an hour. Kissy, kissy, kissy, kissy, and make them look great. Oh, yeah, my good friend and I'll Hitler. Nice mustache, shit off. God, I, it makes my skin crawl just to think about the fact that this man is on there for an hour. I don't be grudge in the money even though you ripped off all the people down here and he's just come back. I don't be grudge of anything, all these 25 wives, but to go on here and do something like this. This was the, the worst moment in the history, the history of the media. 10 past 10 is 5 60 W to come. I don't want to get it. We, you know, worked up here on a Tuesday. Do I want to get worked up? Uh-huh. FNA, I do, baby. Scumbag, disgusting, subute. Oh, he found Jesus. And, and for him to be sitting there saying, oh, God is forgiven him. I hate to break the news to you. Okay. This idea that you believe in some religion that you've gotten murderable bunch of innocent people and that any, anybody can forgive you. You know what I say to that? That's what I say to that. Let me pull this with. Just just for a few seconds. 20 60 W. I will give it to you. What a suck-up job that was. I was to do the actual way, but I didn't believe it. I'm not even a week. Because I'm a feminine guy. I don't know if it's a feminine guy. I don't know if it's a feminine guy. I'm a feminine guy. But there's a last name at first. I'm a plus we're a feminine guy. FNA, feminine guy. I'm a feminine guy. I'm a feminine guy. I'm a feminine guy. I'm a feminine guy. I'm out of to a talk show. Head to 15 to five, 60 W. I'm a guy. Hey, Goldberg. It's two. We got your manager six o'clock tonight. Yeah. Marlin, Zaby, to Dodgers last night. Any interest in that? Oh, be on a game tonight, whether you like it or not. Here's a lady in Carl Springs, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, ma'am. Hi. I'm from Carl Springs. How are you today? I'm doing great. I'm the mother and the wife of two who Leo's. And for some, I'm calling even though my husband got me to listen to you when I'm not working, which isn't too often. And I wanted to say hello. Hello. And my son came down to visit from college and they're on their way on the term bike north. Trying to catch you for about an hour in the storm here on the way back to Oklahoma. In the storm? It's storm enough here. Oh, my god. This is getting pretty old, you know. And he started to get like Florida. Yeah, starting. Unfortunately, we all live down here. But anyhow, I think this was more like a shock. So my son could hear me on the radio and say hi to him because I really miss him already. And while he was here for a week, he listened to you a lot. And my husband keeps telling him about some kind of commercial that he wanted him to hear. And so I have one of those shameless requests for some so far, king or something commercial that I've heard. Okay. And if you could play that in the next hour, maybe because then they're probably going to be out of your range. Then not out of my range. Well, they're heading north. So I don't know how far they're going to get the station, and especially in this weather that's up in coral springs. And that would be great. And I think that would make his age just a little bit better. Well, bad doing. I hope so. I hope so. And I hope just hear a me on the radio is. That might be a good shock. That's going to really do it. And I don't really know what you were talking about in the past few minutes because I turned the radio down. I don't want to hear that echo. I'm just talking about Larry King kissing David Berkler, which is Son of Sam kissing is actually a good feeling. Well, I heard Jerry fall well. And that was enough for me because all of those people are just a little bit too much. Yeah. Okay. Listen, every great day, sweetheart. Thank you. Yeah. Bye. Listen to me. It's just stand by and see for soficking. And it's stand where everything is out to the high soficking standard. The selection is in just huge. It's soficking huge. Believe me, you'll never shop anywhere else. And soficking surprises on just low. There's soficking low. You'll never find them anywhere else. Listen to me. When I say soficking as a beautiful store, I mean soficking beautiful. And I can't stop it. Help. I mean soficking helpful. Listen to me. Get to know the soficking and enjoy a selection that's soficking huge. A staff that's soficking courteous and fresh is that a soficking low. You'll never shop anywhere else. But don't take it for me. Take it from satisfied customer, Frank and Stein. Soficking good. You set a fracking soficking good. And this place bad. 10 18 and 5 60. Where's fat boy with my goddamn Marlon? I don't know if I'm going to let him out. I think he's worth those tickets. He's a crap probably already in higher. Leah. 5 6 7 0 5. I want to hear from somebody else who saw that last night. And you know what the problem is in this country. I don't want to start getting serious today. Have he duty philosophical butt. It's not just down here. It's the whole country. It's Lala land. They're all going. Yeah. They had a CBS pull last night. And this is on the heels of the Atlantis thing. This is on the heels of the thing out there with the Jewish day care center in California, the LA. This is on the heels of their go back to school in Colombe and high in Littleton, Colorado. On heels of all of this stuff and gun control and guns and whole gun. They weigh down the list of the issues that the public has considered about. They're still concerned about dollars and cents. How much money do they have? It's that are in so on. So you and our a crazy people. You don't have to worry about a thing because the public is usual is going to stop about either. You see this crap like we had in the media last night. This would come to a screeching halt. If CNN got about 50,000 calls from people just frosted just pissed off. I mean something ballistic. And they should have if I were to have a guy named number to call, I would have called him last night. It said, are you people crazy or what? Talk to you about God then mass murder and kissing his ass and trying to somehow legitimize him and pedaling the song of the answer about always saying a prayer. And a whole hour, he's holding the guy then Bible in his hand. He's got to open to this page and that page and the Lord is forgiven me and Jesus there. And yeah, I mean, what a sick bunch of crap that is. And that's part of the sickness of this whole religious bullcraft. There's no incentive to be a decent person to do no harm. There's no incentive in these organized religions. Just believe the same crap that we tell you to believe or at least just pretend to believe it and then no matter what you did, well, well forgive you because there's nobody we love better than the fall of no sinner than whatever. There we were, whatever you say it. As soon as you repent, we love you no matter how many people you kill. That's what it boils down to. Craziness like these people will say, well, if Hitler would have accepted Christ on his death, but he'd be in heaven now. Great, you hang out of that kind of religion. Okay, you sick bastard. Not for me. Nistromer is they say in China. God. And here's this little weasley piece of turd. The luckiest man. This is the luckiest man on the face of the earth that a guy named Ed little at mutual radio of what was become obsessed with him had some maybe he had naked pictures of Ed little with a billy goat that hangs been doing. Maybe he had that. That's the only reason he ever went to mutual and it's the only reason he ever went on CNN. Couldn't interview a god damn billy goat this guy. That's what kind of a great interview where he is. A legend in his own mind, just a professional named dropper, ass sucker, ass kisser, a piece of crap on two legs, a turd with ears, that glory king. And I'm going to show you how much how much principal he's got. Okay, not only did he have Howard on the show here, like a year ago or so, a few nights ago he's got a show on there. I'm flipping the channels again. It's about the show is about back pain. Who would you got on the phone to talk about back pain? Howard. Now this is the same Howard. How many times did Howard make a flu out of him having his crony's calling on a show when he had like some important rule figure on there? Hey, what are you thinking of Howard sticking on that crap? You know the stuff Howard always does. And he still puts him on here because like I said, there is no acid in the world that Larry will not kiss. You could be to move over to head with a sledgehammer and if he thought he could get some ratings out of it, like the night after the shootings out there are a lot of sandals. And if the show starts tonight, tonight, and when no respect, no like remorse, no salemnity, just like hey, show business, you know, the show must go on. Yeah, this is the guy that would have been, he could have been at Troblinka doing singing, there's no business like show business, doing a tap dance on that the god damn mages chambers. Sick, sick, sick bastard. And no, I didn't have to watch it and I rarely do other than a couple minutes of channel servant, but I watched it in just shock and amazement because I knew I was going to talk about it today. Take it to myself, how? I mean, I realized that you know, you can, you could rationalize away to kiss somebody else's ass, but two bad Ted Bundy couldn't still be alive. You could talk about what a charming guy he was. And never stole a freight train, don't forget that. Cruel spring, hello. New. Yes, sir. The point at which I fell out of the chair was when David Berkwell was said that he is now a counselor for the prisoner. Right. That he counsels them and he's a minister. He's a minister. He's that word, too. Well, the minister part is all a bunch of BS to me, but a counselor. I mean, come on. What is this guy talking about on the scan? How do you know, you know, get the pretend you've found Christ in prison, maybe they'll let you out. That's all these counseling amounts. And the dog done it. Right. It's just a humble evening. No matter what he asked him, oh, well, that's a blank period. It was a dark period. It's all blank in my mind. And then he'll write back to the crap about God and the book and all this other horsecraft. I had to turn it off. Otherwise, I would have puked all over my four. How can this be? How can they put this crap on worldwide television? And nobody gets pissed off? They don't put anything on TV, Neil. It doesn't matter anymore. I'd rather watch a Ron Popeille information for 20 hours with my hand side behind my back than watch you that crap again. As long as it doesn't have nudity or or some of the charities they'll put it on to you. As long as it's not entertaining, right? Exactly. Okay. Thanks. 5, 6, 70, 5, 60. Like I said, the public is sitting out there. Eeeeh, he got a gare. Wait, I'll give a crap. That's why every guy didn't think they put on television as you got them scammed in a rip off. That's ever written to your course. You rub it? Yeah, quit rubbing it. All in by the way, I hate to burst your bubble so to speak. You know, who is unbelievably grotesque and ugly, even earlier than Nick of 98 degrees? Christina Aguilario, they had a teen as a word show. Oh, on Fox last week, which is horrible show, by the way. And they give the words to whoever was in the country. Back to the voice, couldn't get any words because they were still in Europe when they dated. Does anybody believe their Jennifer Lopez was the hottest single of the summer? No, no, but she was there. But Christina Aguilario, don't get it. I'm telling you, she is grotesque. She is living proof that camera angles and a lot of makeup can make anybody look lovely. Except for her. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Okay. Talking about Bible suffers and believe me, I could give a crap about this, but I'm watching four class nine out. They have a little ticker tape on the bottom. Yeah. Here comes. Dolphinsine, off the wavers, underwoods on the Viking. Right. Another, a whole, on our team. Right. Another problem. Yeah. Yeah. Jimmy's rehab beer. Yeah. No kid, this guy you heard about him, right? Yes. So the money and took off to be a preacher. Uh-huh. And said the money and who cares about anybody else. Right. You know, hey, listen, he's coming on just a time when they're getting all excited about Cecil and Robert Baker. This, this town is like all the sports fans. They don't care about that. They don't care how many people you kill. How many of your freight trains you stole as long as you can help us win in one fact. That's all they care about. And it's disgusting. No kid, that cost me a douchebag. Yes, sir. Thank you. You're insurance, selling douchebags. Okay. Yeah. Jimmy's, that's why I told you they had to bring in Dave Wants that he's the team of a per award in this year. The only team in the NFL. It's got its own award in 567560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. Maybe it'll be a stroke of luck. Maybe I'll be the only one in the other guy to call a couple minutes ago that saw that Larry King tobacco last night. As many as many people have saw this son of Sam will be nice going air spikily again, as Spike really hits it on the head. And he's asking questions like, well, what do you think about spikily and about his family? And what is that? What does that have to do with anything? Like we want his opinion on filmmakers and on the society, on on sociology and on human relations and etc. And so on. This is the most disgusting program I urge everyone to complain to this station. I'll give a lubricant for the new millennium. Get Y2, KY Jelly. The first whole lubricant for home. The car, the both or the office lubricates appliances. Spike, so long, Mohr. The chainsaw. Grandma's wheels here. I'm falling. The beatie gun. The bow and arrow. Why are you on the cast? Why do KY Jelly? Available at why do you came on? So what's Rodlin sense in peppermint this morning? Well, we need the peppermint now. 1031 at 560 WQM 560 5050 5050 on the mobile one on. Here's a great thanks from the same person that by the way was absent. We asked Eddie Rippen me about Jan and Dean, you know, to stand writing, but here's some good news from this clown from his geek. Just to let you know, Tom Green is trying to make a movie. It'll highlight a holistic stuff that he does. It'll be out this winter. Says the, how do you like that? See, that's what ought to be on worldwide every night. I'm CNN between nine and 10 o'clock. Not some askissing clown hunchback. Something that I give people to you. You're getting all the crap with that crap. What that ad fucking. And this does the thing I really crashed me up there. The Howard school boarder having a big meeting again today in a one teacher springer. He says, well, well, maybe I was a bad judgment. I should have done this bull crap. That's the kind of crap that people are worried about. If anything was obscene, okay? The act looking that was done on CNN last night of a convicted mass murderer was the most obscene act I've ever seen in my life. They could have put Debbie does Dallas on there. They could have put every guy damn portable. We'll be able to make and would have been nearly as obscene or as pornographic as the crap of this scene. This hunchback sitting there trying to glamorize a mass murderer on worldwide TV. Disgusting, gross, test unacceptable. Ted, turn you got a barrier. God, him, head and shame. You got a buried in Jane Finders record. You're still speaking, which I doubt. 560, 50560, pound five 60 on the mobile one line. And like I said, the public out there. Yeah, how we don't know. Wait, I'll care. What's for lunch? And you know something that I'll show yesterday that I have one call about the macaroni grill. Oh, no. Not one call about it. After I told you our great dining experience there that was only that was only blocks by the fact that they had that guy from the kitchen come out that young shfarts are stand up on the table and sing whatever that song was. Old black magic something like that. But he broke into swanney river. I just about lost it. That was that was that was too much for me in the middle of an Italian restaurant. Here's a mobile and Western. Hello. Hey, yeah, I don't. But hey, sir. Hey, listen, I was watching that Larry King last night. Now is waiting. I was waiting for him to jump on this guy. Yeah. You know, he had how many times do you let a guy get off the hook and keep going back to that Bible crap? Anybody else after about the third time that he pulled that crap out of just got pulled the microphone off. So we're ending the interview blow out your ass. Yeah, many says I was in a call and he says it was kind of a call. He never even asked him what he was in no call. He's just a maniac. maniac with a Bible in his hand preaching that he used to you. He's starting over to God. I would like to see about seven or eight of the family members of the victims sitting there next to Larry King asked him some questions. Yeah, I don't like seeing there are pulling the few hairs on Larry said would have been great. I couldn't believe he didn't jump on him once. And then he says, are you going to be envious to me? What I walk out of here and you're not and he goes, no, no. Yeah, who now wants to look like that? These are how you couldn't believe it. Well, Neil, have a good day. Thanks for the report. The worst talk radio I've heard in my life with NWOD. Thank you. 5, 6, 70, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Speaking of a serpent on the teenager wars that you see that girl. I just had the switch on she was like, wait, totally wait, they were holding her up. No, she wasn't wasted. She was that was the make a wish foundation. They brought her out. She was like, whatever she had, you know, we started. Oh, was that the one that came out? I think I was going to bar for that, which I don't think they were prepared for that, but that's what she said. And then, of course, the 98 degrees could. They also thought that we're going to bar because she would, you know, she wouldn't let go of them. Nick is special. She got a lot of the him and she wouldn't let go. Right. Of course, I guess I would need to even let go of it. But I'm not less. Well, I'm sorry. There was that with the story. Listen, I've got a story about this asshole in the 70s. You remember, gold triangle was down here? Yeah. Okay. I was working with gold triangle and that they were doing credit. They were trying to sign up as many people as they could. And they had an unlimited card. If you were approved and you had good credit, they gave you an unlimited card. Long as five hundreds of thousands of dollars in an ever-checked you. Right. And I didn't know. I was fairly young then. I thought very cheap was on the radio. Who was it all right, guys? Yeah. So I knew that for the measure. I got an unlimited card. Well, you know what happened to that? Yeah, exactly. And then he almost got the guy a lot of losses shot. They still got a draw full of bad checks that he bounced at the, I think it's a gulstrum. I think that's the track. I believe you think that the guy would have a little kind of made million with $40,000. His public relations people keep saying, oh yeah, he feels real bad. He's going to come back and pay these people back. Never paid anybody back. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. I'd die. Half of the people are already dead. They're pushing up Daisy. Get that right. I guess is what he's counting on. Yeah. Incredible. All right. Love you, Neil. Okay, so you see a gold triangle. Not that's probably why they're out of business. Larry King did to them. What the old farts did to the puppernics. Put him out out of business by stealing all silverware and sweeten low. I'd go on Larry, you piece of scumb. Oh, he just did that. Come back. 560, 50560, pound five 60, unimobile one line. Here's Virginia key. Hello. Yeah, sir. You know, the funniest thing also when Spike was with all of the set because Kirk was mentioning his show. Mike was upset. Yeah. It's because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because, because said by Spike, you and your wife and your children, he named off his wife and his wife and his wife. All right. I didn't see that. This was when the movie first came out and Spike was upset that that happened. What are you doing? Making a movie about a live serial killer. You idiots.

Get ready for another long season baby hold on tight the same old tired faces. 560560 pound 560 on the mobile one line. Got a great facts here from a guy named Tom Dumphi who lives in a mirror bar. Copy of letter. He sent to the Sun Sentinel about the Marlins ballpark and all of his theory. You see, they're there philosophy. It's kind of like a bob green thing. Who used to say it's not a question of if it's a question of when their thing is it's not a question of if it's a question of where in other words they're trying to convince you and I told you this is the scan that they're pulling oh yeah it's a done deal. It's just we're just going to pick and choose where John Henry wants it and which politicians will sweeten the deal of us. So it's not a question of if we're going to get that new state and even though nobody in town wants it. But just a question of where and they just keep plowing right ahead like it's a fatal company and the public is sitting back there you know like I said oh yeah until it gets on a ballot and then they'll see just like the penny sales tax how long the public is going to say yeah then they'll find out the public remembers that one short word that worked for you a while last time as in no way Jose no more Mar for our god damn money for bidding yours. Here's Miami hello. Hey, New York are you doing okay sir. You're being great today huh. Yes I am so far. I'm not really I want to call you by the week a week and a half ago from Atlanta Georgia and I went all the way down the New York and I was coming back two days ago I felt just horrible just being the miles that closer and closer to Miami. Uh huh and you're happy every time. He just it just feels horrible Neil. It's like walking out of the plane into that jetway and feeling the heat and humidity hits you in the face and you know for sure you're back here. Exactly. Every time. I missed you so far we're going to have an in yesterday I finally caught the last two hours over it was great and I got a shameless request for Joe the Gaggy Spock and he's a national. Okay thank you thanks to the bull and pal. What do you say? Joe's a Gaggy Spock. Okay. 5 6 7 0 5 60 and by the way Joe's a Gaggy afters day we're looking forward to this tomorrow by the way we got because Hank is back on vacation San Diego again. We got the great bills in for on the telephone from Philadelphia on a phone line where's no idea what's going on down here at the course of the down here as any idea who he is voice it off and remember him bills in for a member. No. No. And then on Thursday because in for evidently didn't want to be on two days and row that's too embarrassing even for him and probably asked you to send the ego for that game. Thursday because everybody's out of the end by the way. Loft Lindsey says he wants me to apologize to the entire audience because he has no other choices get off you'd do. Yeah. 2 to 4 30 on Thursday we got. Jersey Gaggy. How do you like that? Philly in for the Humper. That is it is so unbelievable. So unacceptable. In fact it's so bad that he only is going to put him on for two and a half hours. Now we got oh yeah Josh in Orlando Josh there on Orlando Elzaguri after that. To show you how desperate we really are. Shows a Gaggy here on WQ and the only AM station in town that's got anybody under the age of a hundred listening to it and we're putting the dead man on year for two and a half hours. Here's Pompano. Hello. The only time we ever had anybody say anything good about Joe's a Gaggy was when the 13 Andrew. Yeah. That was the only kind of say some of the Gaggy really got killed. Yeah. I mean you got to get the guy credit for that but he was shortly after that by the way. I would be fired as a. Just weeks after that happened they fired as a. I remember that you were not here on everything but you're sucking it on here. You know something he could be a good president of Kated 80s that bland and boring. Yeah he and Elgore and Bill Bradley and Steve Forbes. I was channeled and don't forget Lydia Doyle, Lydia. I don't even want to think politics. I just don't. I was watching the Southern Stamping as I was flipping through the channels and I said wow David Berkowitz. I'll watch it for a few minutes. Joe, we write back to watching something else like wrestling. I mean I just couldn't stand. I've been doing this a long time. Yeah he's absolutely ridiculous. I mean I don't know anybody they want to see that summer of sand movie because Spike Lee is such a yeah buckshunter. You know I was hoping I was watching him. I was watching him for five minutes so I was watching Berkowitz and I wasn't a beam the mayor back then. Yeah. Okay. Now who was the governor? Was the Rockefeller's I tuned it a little way. No probably who carry out with them. Okay that was 76, 77. I thought I rock-and-seller had become divided. Yeah but I'm not trying for it. It was for him. Okay you absolutely write about that. And I'm watching you just stand in my stuff. Okay, you know whenever something on our planet attainment would it they talk about bundle or richer spec or something. I want you just to try to figure out what you get something out of it. And Berkowitz like well you know what what can I say here's one of the few other than Manson here's one of the few Mans murderers who still alive and he puts the gun for an hour and kisses his ass. And then let's undo this phony born again speel and then and then says oh well we're all waiting for you to say a prayer at the end. Like America is just waiting with baited breath to see if it's a sincere or not. And it keeps promulgating the fact that well there were other people involved in some of them were dead and some of them were rewarding met. Yeah what's going to happen to them. That's all very foggy to him because you know he's concentrating now and God has forgiven them etc and so on. He's very confused. It's all blacked out. Oh it's ridiculous. And regarding John Henry and the marlins if they had tried to get a stadium in the first couple of years like he's crazy it must be nuts. Yeah I actually I mean if I could feel sorry for a millioner but he had the guys the business man he should have known he was going to be stepping into when he took over the marlins he had 1% ownership of the Yankees the best team in base block. Not a base block fan as much as I used to be but he had 1% of a world series winner. I'd rather have that than 100% of a loser a losing proposition like the marlins. But I mean the guy is I don't remember he and Wayne are joined to tip and let anybody give you a song of events that they're not the two of them are joined to tip. Yeah but he's also buddy buddy with airs and well oh there that's even worse. Yeah he I think there's been a Wayne on one hip in the man they split in the Mickey on the other hip. That's why he's going to try to put that's why he's going to try to put the stadium down and when he might have something to be such good buddies with Mickey why does he have Mickey given the money to build a goddamn stadium? How's that sound? Right down there downtown Miami right by the goddamn American Airlines of Shamarina. On there Mickey's got to do a thought there wasn't a couple about them coming to the store. Then we could put another slip in there for another cruise ship for Mickey and all the gambling ships they're kicking them up but Mickey you know what can we do for you? You're right about that. So you're going to say for all the tourists out of here in the drain all the money out of our economy. You're right about that you know so many people I know they used the love base block the strike of 1994. That was it. That was the end for me I'll watch a little bit out of boredom on TV channel surfing but it's it's terminal. You know and the thing is that and you know something if it wouldn't have been I mean they looked out two years in a row. If it wouldn't have been for the social and aguarding last year and now again this is telling hits 47 last night they're time. If it weren't for that I mean they could take the whole thing and flush it down the toilet. I don't care about tight penit races or wildtrips you know that that's not a big deal except for the people in those markets but if it weren't for that there would be no interest they'd be finished. Yeah I mean a cow ripped and that's why they wound those baseball so goddamn tight. A cow ripped was like the only other thing of like $24.95 that day they say really say baseball. When you see the kid that used to play what does his name Jay from the appirates used to play short stuff. Jay bail 29 home runs. This guy's a home run hitter like I'm a home run hitter 29 home runs they've got the ball wound as tight as a golf ball. It makes a mockery of all the statistics and they're only doing it because they're desperate. Yep you're right about that. You can take their baseball and they can shove it up the guy damn Hershey highway and we'll never miss it for a minute. Well hey they were the one other thing they'll let you go in Seattle they build a brand new stadium. Another thing is go be $100 million in cost overrun. Yeah and the Mariners is saying to the community if you don't put up $100 million there's no way we're going to be able to keep grippy and rod rega the two guys that are pretty team like they did here. Yeah I was with Randy Johnson the two guys are the reason that the Mariners were at all a success. So I'm so I'm so I go to show you that just building a new stadium and spending all of that money. No guarantee you're going to have a contender even a decent team as the Orioles have proved with their $80 million and the Dodgers have proved with their pae rule doesn't mean craft. It's worth an enclosing art little bit from the court of that your douchebag. Okay. Okay. Nobody Qm invited the abok.com. WQM celebrity golf tournament that's what the ruhr.

Just like after the ratings come out and I said, let's get a call ponytail and have a whole bunch of food in here and you and that really shocked the economy. Just shocked me. Shock me. Bluff a stand in there when you're saying, oh, do you think we could ask Greg, would be okay if like we have to ask his permission. Like we're going to pee on his parade if we want to have a million. He's going to want to do the work having one of their food. Well, I don't care if they're having one put in the guy name hallway. It'll disappear. I put it on a copy machine. It'll disappear about 30 seconds. We have to ask Greg his permission to see if we can get free food in here to feed the troops.

But going all the way up to Boca for a steak dinner, I don't know. I don't know. Okay. Well, it was $100 gift to do it. In fact, I think there's a message in my answering machine from a Rimmerstone. You just have to be going up to Boca one of these days very soon. But at any rate, we got that one pending and now we got the natural really great. See, I don't understand. I'm very grateful to the guy from the Pembroke Pines from that location we're calling in. And Gary Sartotel is going to just go into that. So I'd have Macaroni grill a big contract here on the station, which we're going to call me Sartotel. All I said about because it's a good joint. But in the audience, is there anybody called in? That's ever eaten there? It's got anything to say? Oh, I don't understand this crowd. You know, I realize it's a summertime and I realize that day by day between now and Labor Day, I mean, you talk about thinning out even my hair hasn't been to now like this town has. But there's got to be somebody. There were a whole bunch of people in there that night last whatever night it was. Thursday, damn good stuff. He called it for Katsya. It's like for Katsya, but it's like, I don't know, how to describe it.

It's speaking about here on five 60 year WQF, your patient station for the 90s. Not. I have a feeling this is going to take a turn for the worst of it. You know, I came into they feeling so good. I have no idea why because that goddamn little dog of mine. You know, every time it's thunder's about 10 miles away, thunder lightning, he starts in like, it just gets worse every year. It's worse and worse and worse and worse. And I keep thinking of the veg just how perfectly that my microwave oven was made for him. Perfect size. Kept me up all God day night finally four in a morning. I fell asleep three hours late by head as well. And I still feel great. But I just had this sneaking feeling. And you know who else didn't call us by the way yesterday. My good post personal friend, Sherry from Boka. I went out of my way to get those backseat boys to get for her and her a decent daughter. And I got him sitting right over here and she never called in the ass form. And I was wrong with you, Sherry. Here's a lady in Westchester. Hello. Oh, good morning, Neil. Yes, man. I love your show and I'm going to talk about macaroni grill. All right. I heard just the end of what you had yesterday. But I heard the gentleman a few calls before asked you what your on tray was. That's what I was going to ask you. Yeah, I'm going to mistake. I had the pasta with me was okay. But I think they pre-cooked the pasta and they leave it which I don't like that. You know, it should be cooked. I'll then take the order but it wasn't. Right. But you know, I wanted that. It was pretty good. But I mean everything else was great. And the desserts aren't to die for. The dessert was, oh, if I knew the dessert was that good, I would just skip everything. I'll send to them. Right. I haven't been there in a while. We want to go back. You know, you forget about. Yeah. Now did they say that old black magic when you went there? Oh, no. It was before that. But I wanted to ask you. Did you know that I would call that a medium price rest. I wouldn't use it. Yes. And I've heard from restaurant tours that a lot of the medium price restaurants. I love all of oil and I cook Italian. They don't use olive oil. A lot of them don't use milk. Oh, well, they should use the little thing there. They have a bottle of extra oil. I was going to leave a right on the table. I was going to tell you about the bottle on the table. I was very impressed with that. But I mean, that sort of just goes with it. But I wanted to ask you, when you're in, I've never been to Italy. But when you're in Italy, even in the moment-pops places, today cooked with the olive oil and put the bottle out. Oh, sure. Yeah. Because of three deculus Italian foods, the one of the basic things is olive oil. Yeah. And I love eggplant. And I cook it. I see it in a roll and in central and southern Italy, they use a lot of olive oil. And Northern Italy, they're more into the butter. Like in Milan and that part of Italy. Right. Right. And also besoto and that crap, you know, all of that. Yeah. But I mean, that's one of the main things. And I do like macaroni grilles. And we're going to go back. Great. I'll mention my name. Just tell me your new rod. You know, so yeah. I have a great day, sweet day. Okay. Thank you. Bye-bye. Guys, guys from the kitchen, Tom, please don't come back soon. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T line. I guess we're struck it out with the godfather's thing. Uh-huh. We'll note that yesterday. I'm just depressed. And you know something, maybe it's not anywhere near as good as it used to be anyway. Because they were talking yesterday about how all well it's the thin and crispy. See, maybe that's what they went down the old, the furlet. Try to emulate pizza. Why would you want emulate pizza on the first place? I mean, I would all do respect to my old friend, red, who's a great guy. And brought us a lot of great pizza in say they a hundred years ago. You don't work for them anymore anyway. So what's the difference is it make? But I mean, pizza hot is, it's okay. You know what bothers me the most about pizza hot? It's inconsistent. It depends on which one you order from, what they at the week it is, which kids happen to be working there at that moment. Uh, you know, who's got the greasy dirty hands? I mean, it's just, it's never the same. At least with dominoes, you know what you're getting. Crap. Don't admit on the air that you had dominoes last night because people who lose what little respect they may have left for. They'll lose. I mean, why would you admit that? Wasn't up to me. Why would you have told me that even? Come on, you should be press because it got me thinking about going. But what kind of people you're hanging out with that we're ordering dominoes? Come back. What kind of scumbags would it must have been your relatives or so, Rhett? Low lives. No. Oh, you're in laws. Oh, I'm sorry. Five six. Well, that's what you always say. Oh, that made it worse. Five six seven. Oh, five sixty pound five sixty on the 18th. Do I know where he's watching Jerry Spirier or something? Oh, anyway, she's not listening. Sorry, crystal. I do like you daughter though. Finally, child, Aaron's coming on Ashley Luzband. You boys, you boys in now, you stay still. That's what you're doing. You're still in, you stay still. That's what you're doing. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in, you're still in. You're still in. That's just not one. We're going to have to think about that long and hard. It's 11.15 at 5.60 WQM. We went to the breakway at like 240 calls waiting on the board. They were smoking. It was sizzling. And of course, now there are three. So, I close here, man. It's not like the old days. We come out in this all the time off the. We sit around. We come as a rate. We mown and we grown. Well, it's right like the old days. But the money's a lot better. If you ever get it. 5.6705. 60. It's not a question of if it's a question of when. That's the philosophy in this business. Especially the B's Lee B people. You'll get paid eventually. If you have a lot of patients and you can survive the bill collectors. Well, I've actually given it to you if we have to. If you hold a gun to our heads, we might look at the fork it over and a money too. Here's a mobile and for a lot of Dale. Hello. Mobile and for a lot of Dale. Hello. Yes, sir. I have a question. Yes. Concerning the baseball stadium. I'm listening. Okay. Why understanding is a state or county. You need a subabond issue based on the revenue from the marlins would be the pay to it would be the perfect way for them to raise 400 million dollars. Says who says he or says you, yeah. Yeah. No, it's been done for big projects everywhere. Why has it not been done possibly on this one? Who's eventually going to have to pay for that? The revenue from the marlins. And what if there's a shortfall? What if the marlins don't make the revenue? Well, I mean, they still have to pay for it anyway. Oh, they do. Yeah. They're not going to go for that. Well, it's a best way to get money without laying out money by individuals or taxes or paying all of John Henry and tell them that. Okay. You call them up and tell them. Because as far as I'm concerned, the answer is no matter what kind of funding the answer is there. I must be crazy. I must be nuts. Still the same. No. No. Just get out of town. Just go away. 560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. We got 6, 700, overlazed. I don't want to talk about John Henry and Julie pressing. I want to talk about the fact that they're going to try to put this over on a public because I'm very confident that if it goes out of ballot and date and brown or if it goes on anywhere, that's going to be the answer. Make it almost take about it. Here's Hylia. Hello. Neil, God. What's somebody? Yes, sir. Hey, young. Whatever you do, don't ever go to pizza, honey and Hylia. Yeah. Well, macaroni and grilled.

But service sucks. At least I went to the one in Denver, Pindon. Yeah. You mean the guy that just called him in to go, Pete? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, he just called a few minutes ago and offered us to free me. Also, you know, maybe for you the service was bad. Next time, I'll mention my name and service will be a lot better. Oh, I hope so. Yeah, because you'll tell him that if you don't get real good service, you'll tell me about it. We'll put it on your rip in the ass. I couldn't have said it better myself, pal. Oh, yeah. That's that a while. He said it just the way you're on a sale. We don't want to pay for that crap. Only he spelled crap with an S.H. Nice going, sir. God bless you. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a AT&T wireless line. Twenty or thirty thousand open lines. And the audience is dead as a freaking door news. You're not going to bring me down today, baby. I'm counting those days. I'm counting those days till vacation. I'm counting the days, the minutes, and the hours. Just look on our website on thearajus.com and you'll see some other days that I'm counting too. Okay. Countdown the weeks in the days in the months. So I could say goodbye. Thank you so much for making me bang this speak to every day for the last 25 years. 26, whatever it will be at that point. Thank you so much for your. And you know something maybe I think about this every once in a while. I'll all the way really doubt it. But I'm trying to give this area the benefit of the night. Maybe I have a really jaded view of South Florida because of the fact that, you know, my relationship with this town is based on these four hours every day of my life between 10 am and 2 pm. Maybe there's a lot of really friendly folks out there and really out goal and and really bright. And this is a real activist kind of a place in a fun place to live at. You know, and maybe it's just, ah. Yeah, that might be a these lifeless scumbags that I try to motivate every day between 10 and 2. Maybe they've jaded my view of this town. No. Give me a really wrong impression about it. It's all about it. That's impossible. No. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Okay. Great. Okay. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Yes sir. Okay. Great. Okay. No. No. No. No. The beesleys are the cheapest bansers in the phase. They make the French Canadians look like big timbers. Hi, Harriet. Hey, listen. I love your show. Man, ah, glad to use left wing, radical tricines over here having shut you down yet. I'm pulling you on the cellular so they don't trade. Through the number. Screw him. That'd probably enjoy. Put a smile on the plate. Hey, I heard there's a godfather's over here on Metro. Yes sir. I work over there. I'm going to get what you're trying. I'm going to give you a report. Which I tried. The adrenaline. I'll try the effect. The a deep dish. The append pita. That was their original thing. It's the best. All right. I'm going to get them to try today. You still want to be a place of north and uh, Connecticut. Yeah. Good pieces. Like, and haven't had any sort of music order. Well, this is a lot different. I mean, it's really unique. If there's still making it the way that it years ago, but it's really out of this world. All right. I'll give you a call back tomorrow. Okay. And thanks for the show. Thanks. Yeah. There you go. See, I totally get a guy from four. Myers. He always got a pay on his dime. He's going over to Godfather's to give it a try. Great stuff. If it's like it used to be, but of course, she never know. We'll find out from this guy tomorrow. He's going to be a little bit more powerful. He used to be because he never was there before. So what's he got to get you up against? You don't sense? You follow what I'm, yeah. But give it a shot. 560, 50560, pound 560, on the AT&T, wireless line as we keep banging away and banging away and banging away. Just like Peter Northman, banging away. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. Recommendation for you. Yeah. Any speech in coconut creek? No. You've been there? No. Well, I want to go to coconut creek for Pete. Well, since if you happen to be there, you know. You're looking for Pete today. Even with a crust. I'm going to move for Pete to hot to thank, Chris. In a town where, unfortunately, franchise pizza is the best we can do. Any pizza is something that definitely stands out if you ever in the area. And it's not like I worked there. I don't, I swear. I don't. I'm just telling you, I used to live in coral springs. And I used to go there all the time. The pizza is excellent. The slices are huge. The prices are great. If you ever in the area, you should definitely look to check it out. Okay. And I just had another question for you, Neil. First of all, I'm a long time first time. Okay. I love your show. If self-law to is that bad. Yeah. And I'm not trying to be antagonistic or anything like that. Yeah. Why is it that you say? It's called the twice a month getting a very big check. Sorry, I'm the up. Okay. That's the answer. That's the only answer. There is no other answer. There is nothing else about it that I like here. Nothing. Zero. I mean, I could lie to you. I could make up a big song on a dance. That's the only reason. Well, that's, you know what? There's more for me. Big, you mungous fact check twice a month. Sign me up. Okay, well, love your show. See you at Annie's. Okay. By the way, how's Annie doing on guiding lights? You're not late. Oh, so you're no more. The prince and the prince has sent all that other stuff. And now we find a little boy. He's still alive. How do you like that? At the end of the show yesterday, there I'm guiding light. As it keeps getting worse and worse and worse. Thank God, it's a little young Billy all of a sudden grew up. And sprouted into a fine young lady, a young man, whatever she is. And just at the moment at Bill and by the way, is there anybody in this audience? Does anybody named PLR? Do you know anybody in any girls named PLR? Huh? No. Only I'm guiding light could we have some bitch who's by the way Puerto Rican, but her name is PLR and her family's the only mob family in Springfield. You're following this so far? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Here's a four-waterdale. Hello. Hey, Neil. What's going on? How you doing, sir? Not bad. I've got a great participatory with you. Go ahead. Actually, I've got a great response, yes. The bread is great. The actual house one is in bed in a sharpening. And it gives a big jug and it's kind of on the honor system there. Yeah. How many glasses do you drink? How many glasses do you drink? How many is love to the big jugs. But actually, there aren't trays. I mean, I've eaten a couple of times. There aren't trays are kind of disappointing. Really? Yeah. I don't know what it is. A couple of dishes I had are kind of bland. And one time we had dessert was good. I could keep mentioning that. But I don't know. I'm sure the desserts were great. I mean, I'm going to, you know, something in fact, I had the Amorado cake that's in the caramel sauce, you know. And they give you a big, big desserts to which is the last thing I need. But I had it anyway. And they had another dessert that was just too big. I thought that's going to pull you to a dive at a coma. It's a big chocolate square. Have you seen that? Because they bring you the whole dessert. Yeah. Yes. The big chocolate square would like the whipped cream on the sides. And then they pour hot hot fudge on it. Actually, had that. Oh, really good. Was that good? That was actually awesome. The entree is, I mean, I think it's a decent place. Um, but you know, I was wondering if you were going to do the wrong thing. I mean, I'm going to be able to. Because the pasta was definitely, it was okay. And that's it was bad. But you had the feeling that it was like, you know, cooked like before. And then reheated, which is places that do that was pasta. That's not a good idea. You always make it because it only took how long is it? Take different pasta anyway. You know, eight minutes, ten minutes. Cook it all, then say. That's right. A, one thing about this perka with thing last night. Hey, why would he even give him any kind of spotlight? That's my point. And then put him on your kisses. And why would see an informittis? This is the most outrageous crap I've ever seen in my life. And nobody cares about it. I think, well, you know, that show is. I didn't have a, I can't see. I'm just listening to, you know, your opinion on it. But I mean, why would he, well, like I said, why would he give him the spice? First of all, second of all, why, you know, the way you're telling it. I mean, why wouldn't he even, uh, pin them down and ask him some questions. I'm going to work on that. Every time he tried to ask him and he did it very gently with kid. Well, as maybe I thought it was going to get out of the chair and just the break. His neck was under. But every time he, even border button on a tough question about all the murders and why do you do this, he would like just evade it well. It's all a blank spot in my memory. And now I find the Lord and the Lord. I know he's forgiven me. And so I can, and it just a bunch of double talk of pilot crap. To that, he's shown self-allарic. I, I, I'm doing this a long time. He's been doing that a long time, you know. I knew I'd take it easy. And see, and count them on the all the way to the bank. I guess, you know, forget about conscience. Just take the guy there money and run the bank like I said. Right Larry. Okay. Oh, speaking of music, by the way, I never asked about, and of course this audience will lay no about that group about Eve 6. And the video, uh, tongue tied from some movie, which we don't know the name of the summer, a soundtrack or some movie that, uh, this tingle thing I think is the movie. I got a couple of tingles watching the video, especially the drummer and the guy that they didn't sing in the video about Jesus God. Although I tell you want to, you can say what you bought about in Rica. You know something? It's good. You can say what I'm saying, more by his nose. You want to know why? No seriously, because if he didn't have that, he would be too perfect. And of course, to show that God doesn't want to make anybody too perfect. Yeah. It's like J.P. with all that hair on his body. You know, he came look like a walking quilt. Yeah. If he, if he had like no hair on his body, he'd be too perfect. And everybody would be like chasing and grabbing after him. Besides me. But in Rica, you can come on over here anytime. And by the way, will make sure Sam isn't here that day. Okay, we know that Sam doesn't know. He wouldn't know. And Rica, if he walked in here right now, Sam. Mr. wannabe, Mr. Latchon to the rest of the human race. Mr. I wish I were somebody, but I'm not. So let me stand in the background to get my picture made with famous people. And by the way, Sam, have been around lately. No. He's on his post vacation and recovery now. Hello, Austin.

The other thing was, this morning on, before the today show, the local channel six, they interviewed the guy who owns all the franchises and pizza at the Miami, and he's a really nice, really nice, really nice. Yeah. So, you know, that tells you whether pizza's coming from and, you know, in consistent, never location. Okay. Okay. Whatever you said. Okay. Holy, oh, is it worth some consistent?

I had somewhere close by us here in North Bay County, right up by county line road. There must be. Must and there. Not dominoes. I will not. I'm going to tell you if I ever if dominoes pizza ever was in this building and I knew it. I would leave the building until I knew the coach was clear. So guess who's on the phone. Pizza law.

It's personally when I got kicked the he had like a fishing thing You know like a box a tackle box and inside the tackle box was in order to have all the different places for the lures instead They had like little packages of pepperoni and cheese and all the other stuff and so he's got a plain cheese pizza And here the other delivery guys bringing his yeah, oh no, I'm the guy with a pizza and we're undercutting the price I can give it to you cheaper What did you want on it the guys is extra cheese and you opens up to your tackle box and pulls out a bunch of cheese and spears it on top of the And the guys is getting out of here get the F out here and it's just we got worse from there the guy with a hammer came on and after Turn off the camera.

I mean, you know, he was okay Hey, let's let's not get carried away You would think by the way. I was thinking as about what a sexist world we still live in because it's run mainly by heterosexual males Which is why you see all these hot young female things on air like at MTV Jennifer Lopez Christine Aguilar who by the way is a real pig, but they you know gutter dolled up to look good. Oh seriously How many how looking guys you see on MTV and please don't tell me like back street boys Forget it wouldn't touch them with your hand 98 degrees I do like nickelot, but I mean at face that knows you know love his music forget Jesse camp Who exactly He's a freak I got him on a studio over here. Jesse can't you get something on the right five minutes like a VJ or some He's a Yeah, thinks he's a singer put his CD out.

It was excellent every time I've been up there I've just made a effort to stop over there and I keep wondering why they don't have it down here But then again like you say whenever we have something good they take it away Yeah, from us. We'll see the guy before I mean that would be a good point. Domino's bottom up because you know You if you can't beat the competition you buy them up and they can go away But in closing down right Murray Terry Murray and Bill Tory why okay We'll be saying goodbye to all three of them before midseason.

Keep people to get the check there on time. What's it hold your breath? Hey there you go. Hey, listen.

How do you like that? Thanks Carolyn for the bad news. Why did they do that? What is wrong with you people in the restaurant business are realizes a chain and some consultants somewhere Somebody in upper level management when it came up with the concept they said oh, yeah This will be another wrinkle will put in a little make us different and there really be neat et cetera There is maybe I'm wrong you can correct me if there's anybody in the audience that goes to any restaurant for entertainment They want to go to where I am a little about you, but I go to restaurant for the food I said that yesterday I'll say it again today I don't give a crap about somebody playing a violin about somebody singing me a song Especially about somebody getting up on a goddamn table and singing a man. You know, I mean forget it Swanie river whatever that was Christ This is a thing my good friends at pop at O'Parks the geniuses that they are Those are the deal they tried in the dining room last year along with the Brown table the paper table close and the gourmet dining for all the old slippers that come out there That lasted about five minutes And they had a bunch they had this aqua pelagroop that would come around about five of them three at chicken two guys All of them ugly by the way, and they would come around to your table. They wanted it or not And they would stand there and here you're trying to watch the odds and you try to get you know Go make a bet Here's all the final casting you try to bet three tracks at the same time and they're standing you distracting you and they're singing do up at your goddamn table And it's like when somebody you know calls him gets a strip or to come in on your birthday It's that kind of embarrassment you sit there and you want to crawl into a hole in the ground That's how embarrassed you are like See are they ever gonna go away, you know, can I look now or they gone yet? Why why are people hung up on that kind of crap? Nobody goes into the macaroni grill or any other similar kind of a restaurant for the entertainment Now maybe I'm wrong maybe there's somebody that's totally crazy out there that needs to be committed Need to be in a rubber room because if you call me and tell me you go in here to see some maniac or a bunch of instead of on a table and sing a polycraft and you need help Here's a coral gables hello Coral gables stay down.

He's working on it. Oh, no, I can't I can't deal with that Not that I don't trust my good close friend Woody Grayberg Not that I don't take his word as the MS, but anybody that did that much acid it would stock the original one. I'm sorry I have to have an answer this week just like I want my goddamn dolphin tickets Did that even for me? I gave my tickets away. I promised him to somebody else and fat boy no problem No problem, pali if I seen him as in oh, I won't see him again The biggest scam artist on the face of the year is fat boy just Unbolt right on that on all you guys you gotta see that's one thing about this place no matter what I say no matter what George says word troublemakers We're liars we're compostable crap artists no matter what we say They don't believe it. They do the opposite just like Greg coming here. They're the one Roll Acted his life Thursday and And running around the building. Oh, what was the real story? What really happened? That's the kind of guy that we work for a guy that no matter what you say if and of course you'd expect that from him because when you tell us many tall tales as he tells It's very hard to have any credibility with anybody You think everybody's a liar or shouldn't have said that?

Hey, it's great. See every place I've ever been every place. It's just like what you go to a sporting event somebody can butcher the national anthem Can just brutalize it and yet everybody Hey, I'm right. Let's hear it. I need to do their aplonic visit lettuce over or because it's just out of habit Instead of saying hey you suck it out here. Let's get out of the game something like that Too many pushes out there.

I used to bring you some muffins from the oven to her. Oh Yeah, Jesus Christ from 100 years ago I've just had a I was like me Give me about 10 seconds at me too. I was I was in the macro. The first thing across my mind was I was sitting a table away for you at the macro and you grill like really long He didn't say something. I you know, I was with that was that they with a whole birthday gathering I was that took toward the back of the restaurant and I I caught you. I turned around to hear the bus boy singing that wonderful Are you swanie river? Yeah, and I was gonna pay my homage, but I got up and you were gone. Oh I got to go that's thinking that's my first time probably and years that I'd been in the macro only grill and Be the last time for a while. Yeah, what one of they stopped doing and I can't imagine that there's one person They really enjoy that and most people are just trying to be too polite and they're too quiet to to speak up and say Hey, that was crap. We just want either dinner and peace and have a good time if you want to play a little music in a back like most restaurants do That's fine, you know, I was just by I tried to continue quietly my conversation, but Oh, no, you can't do that You have to sit there like speechless in all while this performance goes on and you're going What is this what is he doing? I was getting to the punch line of my big joke and It was the song was over It was flat, yeah, but it's a happy tune down the audio net all day here and Unfortunately, I can't get any radio reception. I'm in downtown Miami. Oh, I forget that Unfortunately, they are pink and blocks are signal I've done I think that might be Yeah, you might be on this something, but I would if you put me back on hold with George I'd love to maybe swing by bring you to buy some of those Very muffins and maybe I'll sing a little tune wall man The first part sounds good Hold on, okay, no, okay Talk to your buddy Michael a muffin man. I can't eat him because you know They have all those carbs in a maturegile eat him anything for free. George will pop in his post 560 50560 pound 560 on a mobile one on we're trying to solve some problems here for you business people out there who just don't understand how you do business all of it Probably doing pretty good I'll take another place that I used to go to since we're talking food intensive especially in that area And I'm sure they're all over town still was flood rockers. Can we say that on the air? Oh, oh, I can't say it See that's part of the problem with at flood rockers think they can't advertise because you're not allowed to say that on the air flood rockers And the food is very very good. I like the idea if you go in and you get your burger and you go around and you put on the cheese sauce Also the only problem is that they butter the bun and you know what happens? I'll make it all every time. I mean guaranteed you could be plugged up from 100 years and you have one of those with a buttered bun I'll make it share every time like a gigantic lob bomba just came through your colon And I remember when they first opened there on university in Sunrise, is it I think When I went first open man you couldn't get anywhere near that place. It was Jan and man round a clock Air beam minutes that they were open. You couldn't get near it for lover money Still there Here's Miami. Hello, yes, sir Okay, good talk good talk at you before you get to it. Here's a Hollywood hello Oh Hey, um, this is a first time call to you, but I've been the world was a long time Cucinos the pizza place. Yeah, is I did I worked at both of them when I was a teenager Both places are identical to saying it's like some owner or some corporate officer took everything you needed Fundometers opened up cucinos just changed the name on the top all the paperwork to saying all the ingredients Everything was exactly the same except for the name well, then how could all be good? How come everybody says it was good then? It's not it's identical food as common. Nothing different at all and Domino's I think in this where is your my dogs would need Domino's that's how bad Domino's is my dogs wouldn't look at it Domino's used to be the 30 minutes free and they when they stopped doing it after they got a big client base Cucinos started to try to rob some of the Domino's customers over them I when I was working there. I thought it was some sort of like tax scam or something going on So they went came into business open up a lot of locations Then they went right out of business just for staff So I thought there was some crooked in you know up in the corporate and I'm right now didn't mark you But it was it's everything is identical to Domino's nothing different at all everything That's all okay Thanks for being good news. Okay. So in other words, Christine those sucked in spite of what George and the other guy said it was a Domino's repunk for clone I can only talk about the one that was up here right in this neighborhood well he said your full of crap 567 oh five and 60 pound fine. He said your full of crap whatever he said it was the Domino's poem and he knows is a crap He in fact that was the first thing he said Yeah, he will Rogers God Huh There he was just the walking on the ceiling These決s when Two they look do The next thing I knew we had only men on its feet sing And do what they did it them they did it They'll find out on a scene and the dumb are on a speech thing And do what they did it them they did it They walked on walked on who met them My dog walked on through my dog They cured a leper source out Oh, some say he's the son of God Yes they do, but there's other people they get so hot Now he's the reason that we have any star days soon And do what they did it them they did it them they did it And he's the reason to set all the Christians for a day And do what they did did it them they did o they They could увеличion Raising now kneeling out, increasing The male world of stormed crop To what they did did it them they did it Do what they did to them they did it them To what they did it them easy to do To what they did it them easy to break to 32 at five 60 WQM we got Hank Goldberg a two Jim Mad Dog managed him I write about that Are you sure?

He would like to say what a brilliant show You give we list there's every day. You give we list there's every day Oh, he means the little people That's with two ease. I discovered you when I came down to Miami this year early on the case The station we got here and I lot of you certain words on here like How and goodbye which takes the fun out of listening keep up the good work because they had no first amendment in England That's why it even here. It's pretty shaky because you can't say f*** over here either Thank you Michael a King's College in London, England and god bless you and the bloody queen a crazy old bitch and a drunken Queen mom mom is the board in England by the way 560 50560 pound five 60 on the mobile one line and you know that you would think that they'd have a lot of people Listening on the internet over there because there's so constipated in the press and desperate to reach out to the real world Which is why every time those kids go to Amsterdam. They're out of control Stay out of Amsterdam by the way, all you British kids you screw it up for everybody else Here's Hollywood. Hello What's up? Yes, sir. Hey, you know it's on the pork at Poirchropic cows gets farther as a store stays open longer Yeah, and when they first opened up 40 to be nice and tender now you get it. It's like Okay, my word that's the end of that account. Okay 560 50560 mine's still pretty soft quite frankly and pound five 60 on the mobile one line That's because the ambiguity was out of about 45 minutes ago All look at us we're now in the three calls now. Hey, it's good because I got the we saw set up here I was gonna talk about a least Miguel yesterday and I know you don't want to hear any music But that's too bad because lunch will be here pretty soon I just assume sitting here and play the least all day especially after these three great leds data in the Sun Sentinel a couple of days ago What a nice talk How it's been a little bit I don't know about you that kind of like my pork for my soft Great voice in the world regardless of what anybody will say Including the little spik in the other room Yeah, just because you can't speak English show some Pluts like Ricky Martin is making a big which just makes my heart bleed to think that a no talent queen like Ricky Martin is Making it really big I used to be lucky in different with Ricky Martin You know he looked okay and he never stole a freight train, but now I just I just scream I did not as loud as he screams, but I just go wild when I see him because it makes me angry because he's a no talent The fact it is what it is if he was a talented fact that I'd say all right But he's just just another hype job just another manufactured piece of turd and all over the world Oh, Ricky Ricky That's what I'm gonna every time I see him Ricky go away please you and Larry King a little bit make a good match Because Larry still prefers the top 567560 pound five 60 on a mobile one-line. Oh, I will say Larry finally hit the bottom last night He finally scraped the bottom he's sucking particles off the bottom of the ship right now after the David worker with some of Sam Scam on a yellow King last night the worst the absolute Worst ever Here's a mobile in for a lot of nail hello Yeah, I hate me. Oh, you were asking about why the Sun Sentinel was a strong supporter of Using public money to build a baseball stadium. Yes, sir. It might be the fact that the Sun Sentinel is owned by the Tribune Yeah, I'm sure the Chicago cups. Yeah, but that's not public money. That's the Tribune Well, yeah, but what I'm saying is you think the trip is gonna go against public funding of a baseball stadium when they own a baseball team Maybe they're test driving the effort down here to build themselves a new stadium and further if you would you want to be one of the Tribune executives It shows up the baseball meetings and says hey, we shot down the stadium in Florida That ain't gonna happen so I can't they just keep their mom shut there. Why can't they just present the fact and let the public decide Why they always have to try to manipulate the public for their own personal a profit and gain and not just let the you know the public decide for themselves Just like what that pain sales tax bullcraft. They try to put over Well, you know, I think you're working that for the way baby. That's a capital is yeah Well, if then that's what I say Hey, grow I'm with your hundred percent love show me. Okay 560 560 pound five 60 and like I said before this Chicago Tribune companies got more money than God They owned WGN they own the cups. They've got money. They got a license to steal okay So as a result of that if they're so gung whole about it I'll repeat it again. Let them put up half the money John Henry puts up the other two of them in it And it can build their own guy damn for a Dominican dollar state even leave the public alone for once So maybe we have a little bit of money for some roads and for some schools and for something that's really important in life Besides some stupid guy damn ballpark All these ridiculous emotional psychotic at a tutorials and off-ed pieces about oh It's so important to a city and it's so important to families into our culture your full of crap. Okay You're absolutely full of crap There's plenty of places in America that don't have a baseball stadium don't have a baseball team and a lot of places It's not a fact that they got major league baseball and Vegas. No, it seemed to be doing okay They seem to be raken in the money there. They seem to be drawn millions of tourists in there We're not a baseball park the tourists by the way come to see baseball. No, no And of course, you know in the summertime not only don't we have any tourists anyway, but most of the people live here are going anyway in a summertime when they're playing baseball I'm I know don't confuse them with the facts.

I watched about this great, you know, something the only thing more disgraceful about that than that show is the fact that nobody else here besides me today is pissed off about it. I think it was one of the worst programs. I mean, I want to listen to the guy. I mean, the guy who's a killer. It's not a question about who wants to listen to, but who wants to listen to watch a spectacle of a grown man and adults who's supposed to be an interview or a journalist or sort. Go on there and kiss his ass. And listen to what's so to the answer about God in Jesus and being forgiven for it. And what kind of crap is that? I'm telling you, I, yeah, I like it. And he's talking about, oh, he found God. Yeah. And God, do you think, like he was asking, do you think God forgives you? There's only one thing that you're defined human as a hot seat of an electric chair. That's the thing that you're defined his life. Definitely. That's what they should have done. And last but not least, also for that person that was trying to find. So, Henry, on the radio, he can go to audio.com. Okay. Yes. And he can, he can get a few, or the audio net. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. All right. See ya. Back. Sales people are ISO. And now, Dr. Jeremy Burnham, with a dramatic reading of no scrubs by T.L.C. Dr. Burnham?

No, I don't want to give you mine. And no, I don't want to meet you nowhere. No, I don't want none of your time. And no, I don't want no scrub. A scrub of the guy that can't get no love from me.

I've got a hand code word pregame show here today. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T line plenty of openings. No waiting here today. Yeah, she was okay. She was a little when she said she first of all being on AM radio. Is that why you're on AM radio? You're a little like talk show host. Yeah, that's why I'm AM radio because we can handle a handicap here. It's still be the crap out of everybody else. How do you like that sweetheart? We'd art out. Be on on a crappy AM station and nobody can hear. I don't hear it the left away on the ass end of the dial. We sure beats being on 1900 on the dial like laughing, which is that on the area by the way? Oh, we didn't even more about that. Oh, and by the way, I almost forgot about this. I heard Hank yesterday talking about the rumor. We talked a we never hear these rumors that very jackass was in the building with his superior from the Harold. Talk to our superior. Talk at a Gregory Benjamin Reed about how we ought to lay off on him a little bit. Now, I wonder where he heard that wild story. Are we laying off on Barry on a Harold? No, no chance. We hate the Harold and we hate that chip month with a guy named Fat Cheek. Okay, Barry Jackass, who couldn't get a story straight. If somebody put an oozy up in the rectum. That's pretty interesting. I wonder where Hank got that. Maybe just made it up. Here's a mobile and hollywood. Hello. How you doing, Bill? Okay, sir. I was spotted about the female that called about people off. Yeah. What is it saying? She just wanted to be heard. I don't like that. I put it like a piece of it until I went to that place. Yeah. It's very good. It is good. Trust me, believe me. I do believe you. Very good. Reef their food all the time. Yeah. Let's call it theta, like to show. Thanks a lot, pal. You're funny, yeah. I am. I like just look at me. Okay, I have a great day. Five, six, seven, five, six, six, six. The prime prime. First of all, nobody lets a caller's calling and attack their sponsors on any radio show. Unless there are more on. Okay? I love the Rennidia. In addition to which he's full of crap anyway. And if you didn't like it, sweetheart, thank you so much for going out of your way to call and share that with us. Thank you so much for your negative hostile comments. I saw a cut of, you know something. That's probably that Sherry bitch from Boca. You're not fooling me. That's who that was. That's who that was. But one that loves me. It loves me. I love me. Until I don't give it a goddamn backbeat boy. Tickets would try to have it in the first place for a damn daughter and her punky niece. I'm saving this letter. Okay, Sherry. And I'm also not giving your last name on here because I don't want to embarrass you too much. Although I'm my, I'm my change by mind. The worst letter in the history of the human race, even a poison pen letter, would at least be more fun than that. Starts out with the big keys, which of course a lot of women are real real good at that, you know? And some guys too, by the way, he ain't here no more. CT. But there are a lot of people real real good at that. They dangling out in front of your nose. Oh yeah, you're great. I love you. You're tastefully Miguel, the best people is 98 degrees. Yeah. I'll say it again. Okay, he is as ugly as a pilot dog do. Okay, it is Nick from 98 degrees. But there's something about him, you know? He can sure do it. He's kind of like David Gates. He's got a real sexy voice. He just looks like craft. Everything in. Does he have a last name, by the way? Can we find out from this audience what Nick's last name is from 98 degrees? I've actually somebody out there knows the answer to that. Since they don't bother putting it on a liner notes, I mean, wouldn't that be the best report? At least we know all their full names like Nick Carter and how we derone all of that stuff. How could we know the name of the 98 degrees? Even at Al Bino. Does anybody want to know his name? No. We want to know what he's going away. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Yes, man. You know, I just called you and I like to tell you I am not hostile and nor am I negative. All right. And my concern was, if you're going to, and I don't want to go to the restaurant down because this gentleman lives in Miami Lake where I live. And I didn't know that until I went in. You're going to speak so highly of the place. It's least if I say, Neil, sent me, they should make sure they wait on me. Hand and foot, which they did. They should make sure the pizza had a little extra sauce or a little extra cheese. And I was just, I was satisfied and very happy with everything in the place except the pizza the way it came to me. Is this the symbol of the fold on? Is that how we're going to call before? Call it back a second time. Let me say it again. I'm not interested sweetheart. Not interested. And nobody know they don't put a little extra sauce and a little extra cheese on. Well, you say that Neil sent me, okay? But you wanted to call a second time to give us, you know what you wanted to give us? She wanted to give us a little extra. Yeah. Calls a second time. Do I have to, do I have to test my case anymore on this? I don't think so. I rest my case, okay? The state closes its goddamn case. We rest on our fat laurels. Calls a second time. Maybe they didn't like you, okay? So maybe they didn't like the ugly look on your post. Maybe they didn't like your crappy attitude. They should put extra sauce and cheese on it. When you say that Neil sent me, since when? You're a crazy person, lady. Crazy. You understand? CRA, SIE, crazy. And have a nice day. Let's share. And he don't think he lives in Miami Lakes anyway. Does he live in Miami Lakes? Just ponytail. He doesn't live in Miami Lakes. What are you talking about? You crazy bitch. Let's share. Turning music. Let's share. What is it? Nick's last name. Let's share. I'll say, C.H.E.Y. someone called the same. What kind of an aim is that? Sounds frog to me. And you know, he's a frog? No, no. No, no. But he sure can sing. I'll tell you. Hey. Thought I was going to make you over with that kid. Talker of it. No, he's got it. And those are this. From the chin down, I'll tell him. Oh, my gosh. And I'm so happy. But who's a more beautiful from the chin down. Nick and she are a pretty regular. I'll tell you, even as ugly as he is, he's a lot prettier than she is. Oh, she is. Skanky man. If you were to see that, people were running. People were fleeing. They were running the exit. Screaming when I saw that bitch. I was a mobile in candle. Hello. I'm going to. Yes, sir. That is what psycho bitch. Wasn't that great? Calls Vegas second time. Hey, Nick, flashlighty. You want extra cheese or extra sauce? Yeah. You got to order it that way. Here's something extra for you. I don't even know how to do it. You're a charred person. I mean, you need to order it. There's all the cheese you want. Sweet. There's some more cheese. She's confusing that show with the glory of the show. You say, the old sentient. That's where you could be extra sauce in the X-T-C. That's right. I didn't say hi. I didn't want to switch gears to that to back the pizza. But you're talking about Godfather's yesterday. If you want to reminisce a little bit, you know where that first guy got father started? Yeah. Do I want to know where it's started? No, do you know? No. Yeah. You're original. Oh, my God. Yeah. You've been a little history there, don't you? Yeah. I was there five times in the year five years.

I wish I could remember the names. Every one of them was better than the other one. They're all great. Yeah. And today's was one in Countless. And another one. Especially good because Ron Fraser was buying all the meals. So it was really good. And if you said meals, then you could a little extra gristle. No, a little extra. I'll have to go deal with him. Have a good day. See you. Yeah. Just mention my name. Anywhere you go. You go to the barber shop. Thanks for a cheese if you mentioned my name. Like you said, you go to the glory hole. You'll find extra cheese. Especially that one in the Westland. God. A certifiable crazy person. That's what you are, lady. A crazy person. And by the way, Jeff don't want your business. Stay away from the loft. He's not going to give you no extra sauce. No extra papi, Rooney. And certainly no extra. God. What do you say about a crazy person like that? That's fucking bitch. Baby, you melt my jockey shorts. Don't need that beer. The things I want to feel. Tell me that you're real. Don't tell me you've stopped to wonder about me. Tell me that you're a good man. You're a fool of me, you're a friend. Tell me that that's your role. And I just didn't tell. Baby, I'm looking at this wedding. And there's something to eat inside. Baby. Baby. Get them open now. I'm fumbling up and down. Just frowning. And they didn't say they didn't come from now. No, they didn't. I'm feeling for your image. Get me to me. I'm so upset to be. To find a better image. All right. Because I don't want to. I have to get a piece. I don't need to be a spot. But if you get a book done. I don't need to be a person. I want to be a fool. 145. I'm assuming that's about Brittany. I think it might be about. No, no. Does anybody care if they're real? No. 560, 560, 560. On the AT&T line, I wasn't paying too much attention. I was busy thinking about my pizza loss lady. You know, it just goes to show you. Just like that episode was raw. No matter how long I do this show, no matter how many years, how many months, how many days, how many hours, there's always something new and grow test. But unacceptable. Always.

And you think I'm top out of women in this town. I'm just telling you the way it is. I only wish. And I don't really that but I always go out of my way to be nicer to the women than I have no idea why because they act like, oh well, I'm a woman. You have to treat me. You go easy. Okay fine. And then they come up with crap like this. We didn't want to hear it the first time. Bitch, do we want to hear it the second time? Oh, file a complaint guy. Demo to guide them.
