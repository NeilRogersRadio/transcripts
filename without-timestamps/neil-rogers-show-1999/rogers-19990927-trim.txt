Are you serious? Sports radio, 560 WQAM, Miami for Lodderdale presents the Neal Rodgers Show. You're talking to Neal, called 560 560 told free for David Rao. Or pound 560 on your cell phone. The opinion of Neal is yes, callers are anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of the WQAM. Be easily revacked positions or the beeping broadcast group. Now, Neal Rodgers on Sports Radio 560 QA have. In the open, TKY, F3DK and all. Time once again for Dan Kroyo's family values thing of their illustrating holiday tradition. Even in the 1990, why should that dinner great? Yeah, well, those of the best hamburgers you ever bought. Better than the piece that you had delivered last night. Well, what are you kids up to tonight, Drought? No dad, I've got my believe in group and tomorrow night's lesbian cell. Uh huh, son, you need help with that scale model serial killer you're building. Some other time dad, Cindy and I are going shopping for condons. Oh, sounds like you're getting serious about that girl. Oh, dad, well, I think your mother and I will relax and watch some porn on movies. You too, with a best share of the kid you've ever helped. Thanks dad. Uh, that's quite all right here. Thanks mom. That's quite all right, dear. Join us again next time for family values for you there. Where life is a big moon with the vice president and sub-nevidation. A lot of ad news is, Quail, the Quitareis, God damn it, man. I was just getting excited about him, you know. He's got a Quitareis. He's got nobody wants him and he's got no money and he's a moron and a jackass and a civil den. And he never stole a freight train and there's still nobody wants him. He's out. Another loser. So anyway, speaking of that, well, we got a lot of losers around this place. I'll tell you that. Boy, we got a lot of, are you sure? Positive. So anyway, before we get into that OJ business, oh, my, I've got, I got so much stuff here today. I'm not, I had not had time for too many call. But at any rate, George is going to tell us about his appearance at Prime Co. Saturday, come on, I hear it was great. I hear the turnout was sensational. I hear that they were knocking down doors that they were coming in from all over the South, the Tri-County area to avoid that. Oh, seriously, what do you expect? Gary started by the way that I mentioned today. He's an answer. I mentioned that yet. No. And of course, he'll blame the nephew and the nephew of blame. Same. And this one'll blame that one. And how about let's blame Sam Idis. We haven't seen him in a long time. Thank God. That's our pull question. By the way, who's the bigger asshole? Sam Ducebagger, promotion guy, or Sam Idis, the former I would be saleswoman. That's tough. That's nippin' tuck. That's right in there. And by the way, unless we're on the okay sweetheart, I'll We'll get to that later. The water not see. Her enter a roi. The bokeh Brian's listening by the way. I'm sure he is the great comedy Good idea for you. Remember New Rogers disease, remember that? Uh-huh. Lee Fowler. Uh-huh. I'm gonna borrow that stuff. How about, uh, OJ Simpson disease? Because we have three people in this building who have a terminal case of OJ Simpson disease. You know what I mean? Uh-huh. So anyway, George, it tells me that the only thing that the people, the handful, the small handful, want to do a find out that showed up at Franco on Saturday was, uh, did he actually go to the swim club and Did he do it? Did he do it? Now why does anybody care about your sex life, by the way? Why, why should anybody care? I don't have one of their own appearances. That must be it. I can't imagine anybody sex life. I care about less. Why me? I probably can't think about some, but I mean, talk about boring. And it's gotta be boring. That's why he got to keep dragging his wife getting her all screwed up and slipping her to these wind clubs because he got no sex life. Because like most of the married stiffs, if you've part in that expression, after a while, yeah. It starts getting a little stale. You know what I'm talking about? I'm not talking about the aroma. I'm just talking about the experience. It starts getting a little slowly and stale. And speaking of appearances, by the way, our center one campaign kicks off October 1. Uh, as it does each year here on this station, which means the best in the LCDs will be your spectre doors all over town. Have we found out yet? By the way, are they going to do it at the specs over in four miles? And I found that store on the LL? We don't know yet. Are we going to find out by Saturday? I would hope it would be nice. So anyway, our first appearances this Saturday at the specs in the saw grass mills, mall noon to two. I'll be there. George will be there. And maybe someday, sand the promotions man and our sales department will get together. We'll get a mental on this. Goods and information about what's going to be going on there. We certainly have the best of the brand new one for 1999, which has got some great stuff on there. That will be the Saturday noon to two. But anyway, so George goes out to do the appearance at the prime co in Hollywood. Walks in the door with our promotions department such as it is. And they all look around going like, the fact I'll tell you exactly what they said. When the whole group walked in the door, they said, yeah, yeah, yeah, the whole group both of us. Yeah, the whole group walked in and they said, yeah, yeah, yeah, right. Who are you and what are you doing here? What are you doing here? Another in the latest list. I mean, a long, long, agonizing list of embarrassment here at five, 60 WQAM. Isn't that what our program director said? Is he sniffled out the door here this morning? I mean, shuffled out the door. Another in the long list of embarrassment humiliating and degrading. And what are we going to do about it? Oh, it's a fight, friend. It's a fight. Oh, this place. I'm going to tell you something. Every time people over the years have said, you really got a right of book. And I was like, yeah, everybody writes a stupid freaking book. But you know something, I think the time has come. There has got to be a book written. And I mean, this place, all the other stuff put together. I won't even hear a little bit less than two years. October one will be two years of the contract starting. So let's say it's two years, just for argument's sake. Two years have supplied more material for me to write volumes than all the other years. IOD, WS News, INZ, ZAT, KAT, put together. It's no contest. It's a no-brainer. In fact, when I think of this place, that's what I think of no-brainer. Make no mistake about that. Right from the top. Right from the very top. That's why he keeps sticking that finger in that hole because there's no brain in there. Number Frankenstein? Oh, yes, one. I saw a little bit of that again. It was on the other hand, late at night. Frankenstein. The original? Yeah. With Colin Clive. Now was it Igor? Was the character's name Igor? Now, was not the same guy that played Renfield? Was that the same name? Was that the same name? Because the character that played the doctor, who's named on the ver. Remember, was the same his name as Edward Van Sloane? Yeah. I played the doctor in Frankenstein. Not doctor, Frank. The doctor. Well, the white heroine. He played in Dracula. Van Helsing. Professor Van Helsing. God, does anybody know what I'm talking about? No. No. What are you doing? These people won't by the way. No idea. WQAM? WQAM? WQAM? Hello? Yes, sir. Is it George? Yes. Hey, George, how are you doing? Great. Listen, I have a confidential memo from Clear Channel. Okay. I want to talk to you. I would enjoy this. I love it. 305. 650. Oh, 190. Oh, 190. Okay. Thanks. WQAM? Hey. Well, hello. By the way, the interesting part about this, which I'll get to the Tom Jick article in the Whole Phil Henry business. The interesting part about it, as usual, when something goes on in the video in this market, where do you hear about it from? Oh, God. Even the people in the building over there didn't know about it until we hit it on the year. That's how inside our information was about the new line of changes at stupid talk and about the IOD, which by the way, now that they're putting the Russian doctor, Laura on IOD, that's like the last nail in the coffin. Make no mistake about that. Hello, QAM. Yes, sir. Yes, good morning. Well, I am so upset with the mighty hero. I can't provide you the description. What about what do they do now? In the Howard section, front page big letters. Here's his lady that's crying about our son. They could kill by the cop and Cooper City of Illinois. Three AM in the morning, break it into the guy's house. Uh-huh. And she says she does that money to bury the kid. And the mind here, I'll put it on the front page. Who cares about this? This low life. Come back. Yeah. Well, that comes in the middle of the night, the breakage your house while you're in the house. And unfortunately, it gets killed. She's crying with a great kid. Yeah. And you know, you just call them. Exactly. I was so upset with the mighty hero. Plus they're new for him. I really, I can't find anything. Yeah. They're the paper. They're getting, if you notice today, they've got a whole section telling you how to read the newspaper. They've done this last four or five days. They're going to have a new newspaper. How you're going to rob it? No, yeah. Only newspaper in history then had to put a special section there to tell you how to read the newspaper. pathetic. So what am I supposed to read now? What do you find is the best newspaper to read? Here? Well, I mean, you have to get it from out of town, even. None. Toronto's son. I've never read it. Great paper. Great paper. Great paper. A little right wing, but a great paper. Well, I got it. You know, I'm not going to have no relevant study thing going on here. There is no newspaper here. Get used to it, man. There's no paper. What happened to the Hollywood Sun tower? What happened? The news fair. Yeah. Have a great fact. Good idea. What was the guy's name that used to Ed Plasted? Used to be a sports guy for the Hollywood. I know it means nothing to you. He used to wear these plaid jackets. And I wondered if I had to do with the fact that his name was Plasted or whatever his name was. Ah, somebody out there, remember who he was? If we were taking another call? Oh, yeah. I got so much to say about that. I got, oh, let's move along fast. Get all these 3d spots on today. So, I'm like, I am woman here, me or or if you don't open my door. I can do anything that an I can do, but I don't want to. Oh, the female's acting a lot more class and let's work looking at a mouse trip or that. I'm a 21st century guy, but I can't say they be strong. Well, I'm not sure what could be just those in a pan. Good. Good sex, a special thing in a darned weapon. Because my body belongs to me until I get dinner and a movie. I don't sleep around until we do a credit check. And I have a mind of my own, which I change over 2 seconds. I don't know how to find out what directions to the can't read them up. And I stand behind my men so I can nag and as much as I can. I can fight in combat but I can't feel the fader. And I never tell a lie. But I will think in orgasm. Did I in the ring of the co-wish of my boo-gum-etting? What is this 24? The opening of a new shoe store. And I'm very proud of my age, which is none of your friction business. Oh, this is the best thing we saw much. Thank you for officially regarded. That's actually this internal memo. Although it does say at the top go-caines. Then that's kind of said. How about those kings? Oh, oh, oh, oh. Too bad about that. Or maybe he means go-as in the dumbest of the bus. So here's the internal memo from the inside from clear channel broadcasting, which fits right in. But before we get to that, so get back to O.J. Got so much crapper today, man. I mean, we're just loaded with a crap. Heavy duty. So on Friday, we're rolling along. Sing an unusual song here, doing the show. And the George starts getting all these calls on the inside line, the outside line, the bat line, lines that haven't even been activated yet, from out of the agal term at Lago Mar. Let me, let me give you a little background on this again. Let me set this stage. Months ago, what was it? Maybe four months ago? Tracy Caracero, how convenient that Tracy is not here anymore, by the way? And screw-and-winic, our sales manager such as she is. Who's got a lot of naked pictures? They come in here and when the show ended to clock that day, and they come up with this idea, oh, you know, we know all your big on center one, and we do the thing every year, the fundraiser. And we got a great way to raise some extra money for center one. It's his golf tournament. And of course, my first reaction being a big golf for myself. I thought to myself, a golf tournament. What the, eh. I've thought of what I have to do with that. Oh, no, you don't have to do anything, but we can raise a lot of extra money. And of course, they didn't measure, we can go out and sell it and get sponsors on it. And you know, siphon some more bucks into the station that way too. This is the way we can, you know, financially exploit your center one campaign. Of course, they didn't say that. And somewhere during the conversation, one of them mentioned, oh, I did, oh, we can get OJ. Since in the, you know, I said, if OJ is involved in this in any way, shape or form. I don't want anything to do with it. I'm sure that center one does money thing to do with it. They won't take the money. We don't want to be involved with no asthma to, okay? Okay, okay, no problem. It was just something that, uh, raw. I didn't even mention that. No, no, thank you. No. Okay. I was assured at that point. Absolutely positively beyond a shadow about OJ would not be appearing. Would not have anything to do with this goddamn golf tournament. Because otherwise, and, you know, just stop and think of the sponsors too. By the way, who might be a little bit. Oh, yeah, because I understand this money from some of our salespeople that at least One and maybe more of our sponsors stormed off the course as soon as they saw the Accumator out there on Friday, pissed off and fired up. Not to mention that the people at the center one were psychotic. And then I was psychotic. Anybody else associated with this thing and promoting it? See, I don't want to speak for anybody else. But I have a feeling, just like I told you about management right on the box. You ripped OJ and asked, nice going there, mad dog. Yeah. I don't think anybody on this radio station would have read one promo. We're gotten involved in any way with promoting this golf tournament. If any of us had known that OJ was going to be this. Oh, man. Not to mention the fact that L.T. was there too. Kind of like a Jimmy Johnson event, you know, as many scumbags as we could find around. They rounded up and brought them in. Too bad the meat here is underword was busy up there stabbing itself up in the east Lansing. We could have gotten him out there on Friday too. So the phone starts ringing around 130 and we get inspired reports from out there at Logo Mark. Yes, what? OJ is here. And we're going, oh, he's got to be crap in us, man. Now, let me just say this. Come to find out that all the media showed up to and you people in the media, what a bunch of suckles like I've always said you are. Soon as they found out that he was there, boy, they all come there. They got their their live cameras out there. And they got the, the boom mics and the mics and the, the mics and the, Oh, rock. They're all over the place. Embarrassing. I'm humiliated for you. So they can go out there and suck his ass. Let me say it again. I want to apologize to any of the sponsors who got involved in this. Because I can assure you, I like I said, I can't speak for the guys in the morning or Hank or anybody else on this station. But I just have a feeling knowing the way the sentiments are and the way people talk around here. I don't think any of us would have even dreamed of promoting or getting involved or behind this thing if we would have known that he was going to be there. Or involved in any way, shape or form. Oh, with his golf term. So I know, and oh, it's hard for you to understand some of the people in this building who suffer from OJ Simpson disease. I don't want to mention the water Nazi and the school and when it's a different way. And then the school and when it can grow. And particularly the triumphant who are part of grid read inner circle. They suffer from a, maybe that's why. Maybe it's contagious. Maybe when they're sitting around having those circles, yours, whatever they're doing those three, maybe maybe they contract it there, you know, like it maybe it's like a genital warts. By the way, a genital warts contagious. Very highly. So there you go. So warts new, fellas. So the fact that they've got this problem, we don't want to be. We don't want to inflict it on us. I mean, if you got that problem, go home and do your OJ Simpson blow up dial and, you know, I guess I guess Roy was excited that day because when he saw that big like building, he came in and grabbed it. He thought it looked like OJ. Oh, that's why he ran out of here. Squeeze and finally get and the a dildo too. And screw in. I don't know what her thing is. Except maybe it kind of like, I don't know what that's all about. But we don't want some axiomorter or inflicting on us embarrassment. Nobody in America wants anything to do with this scumbag. And you'll notice by the way, he's not moving here now. That's the new news. Let's hear it for that. I don't like his movement here. And you want it a while because nobody would sell him a house. Every time it looked like he was looking in any neighborhood everybody got together and said, no way, how's that? You sell him the house and, you know, you'll be 60 under. Don't even think about it. We don't want you here. You're a axiomorter in son of a bitch. Oh, man. And all this bull crap. Well, he was found not guilty. He was found guilty in the civil trial. Okay. He was found responsible for the deaths of two young people. His wife and wrong oldman. Okay. He was found guilty in the civil trial. So one out of two ain't bad. And if it wouldn't have been for that dark, complexed jury they had in the incompetent to the prosecution in Los Angeles, well, he probably would have been doing. He would have been playing golf out there when the goddamn correction course links. Whatever they got. Think they have a golf course, wherever he would have been. Oh, yeah. He'd have been out there with the mobsters. Eat and shut the body on and play. And by the way, understand he's got real bad arthritic knees. He's there for that. He's hobbling around. And nobody except for the lowest of the low, except for the silliest of the silliest, except for the most patheticable. And by the way, I will find out before I'm through with all this Charlotte Holmes business I'm going to have to do. I will find out who it was. That brought him in. Coming to find out he was brought in a big, big, long stretch limo. How do you like that? I want to lose paid for that. Can't afford to be paying the gold men to the Browns. Can't afford to pay that money. Supposed to pay. Based on the effort to get that civil trial. They're not getting any his money. They're trying to sell his old jox drafts. All his old high spend trophies. They still can't get any of that money out of this murdering son of a bitch. But somehow somebody put it to the bill to bring him in there in a big, big, long stretch limo to make sure it kind of is much publicity is possible. It's almost like you get the feeling, not that I'm paranoid, but almost like somebody was trying to stick it in our. Right. You know what I'm saying? Stick it to us. Like we're going to show you a thing or two and see the reason that this stuff goes on here at WQAM is because nobody ever has to pay for the consequences ever. Oh, maybe you know, somebody if they open up a big mouth to the program, the director, they get suspended for a couple of days. You know, they go, they put them off the FU, you know, for a couple of days. Teach them how to speak proper to the program director so we don't squirt so many. But I mean, somebody does something road test like this and it seems to me that a firefighter who was responsible for this, I've fired the ranch right now, right in the spot. Because it's subjective. And as far as this business about why you know, of Neil wouldn't have put it on here that he was there. Let me tell you this, man, it was out there doing a show from the government. They had him parade in the round, strutten by. They were calling you. Uh, wanting to know if we would put him on the ear on the phone from out there. How do you like that? All the local TV media was out there. Yeah, just by coincidence, I wonder how the hell they found out about they were there too soon. We'll found out about it by listening to me. So obviously somebody tipped them off just like they tipped off with the man or was that that that that far she put on over there at Heter when London at the airport because she got frist. Just can't get enough publicity. And like I said, put this in a real bad light. Here's your sports station. Here's WQM can's concerning with this scumbag that everybody hates like poison. Here's this charity golf tournament that we're doing allegedly for a good cause and here's this scumbag comes up there and makes a spectacle out of it and brings it all the media right in the middle of it. And like I said, there is nobody here who will make anyone accountable for it. That's the sad part. Project. Humiliated, grossed out, nauseated, disgusted. But what can you do when you deal with people? You can't get you to people. There's an old saying that I like that applies in this place better than maybe any place I've ever worked where there's no sense there's no feeling. There's no sense here. There's no common sense. Everybody's got their own little empire that the the promotion guy who does nothing. Sam and the nephew, they got their little empire in here and by the way, remember when we came here and we saw that the first came up on his floor. We saw the big office for the promotions guy and the nephew, the big promotions, the room in it and the program director was sitting at his little high cheer and in a little tiny cubicle. That's like not too much bigger than a phone booth. That's like a message and of course the lie at that time out of so many lives that are told here on a very every moment of every day. The lie was, oh well that's where Sam's working out. That's going to be a production studio. He's only in there temporarily. Right. Here it is now like many, many months later. Are they building a production studio in there? No, is he in there temporarily? No. No. This is Greg and his boyfriend and girlfriend. Don't you folks understand that how this radio station is ever gotten to this point is a lot of the great miracles in the history. Not just broadcasting, but the human freaking raised. It's amazing. It's astonishing. It is shocking. Not because of our management, but in spite of it. Every time it's like, it's like if you don't go out and take a walk and every time you take another step somebody puts a hurdle in front of you, you have to jump over. Like that big middle thing that hits sticking up out of the road, and now the padded where the guy got killed and trucked right where you see that. Because that's the South Florida F and way. They can't do it slow. They can't do it fast. They just do it half fast. And that's the way we specialize here at QA and half fast. So good. I'll tell you one thing. It's a good thing that that OJ episode happened about one 30 on Friday, and not like 1130 in a morning. Because the steam was already pouring out of my ears. Now only hit about 25 minutes to kill yet. Or she didn't say to kill. You know what I mean? Oh, yes. And thank God that we hit Lawrence Taylor in there too. We had LT all this coming. You know, birds of a feather flock together. Remember I was telling that guy that last week? We got from Amsterdam. It was too many out about it. I don't want to go on vacation. We're just all not nothing but black people. Birds of a feather flock together. And guess what? Scumbags flock together too. You know what I'm saying? Me, you, you. You're. There, paints. I don't think I'm not doing anymore. No. You used to watch me, Shade. Now you do stare at the floor. You don't dare paint it. I don't like the way. I know. You used to be you who made a paper towel in a dirty bag. That's all we needed to get by. Now it's things, things, things that I think that you're the one doing. There paints. I don't like. And you don't. You think that's right. There, honey. I don't think I'm acting anymore. Because when you get to drinking, you put me places I've never been the worst there, honey. I don't like things. I don't like things. Why can't we just get a grip on our mind and the hand relationship? And it turns a truly Halloween field. If we put our hands together, we just stay home forever. Stay your pain. I don't like that. You left her home. When running, round your shaving shave my own. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. I'm going to be a little bit more tired. And Art Bell, Costa Coast AM, 10pm to 5am. 10pm to 5am. Are you ready for that? 7 hours of crazy people seeing little heal amongst us crawling out of windshields of their tractors. Crazy people. Isn't it? The nightly 610 program. A little sports program will expand one hour. Supertalk 940. Supertalk 940 WI and Z-Edsov photo favorite. Phil Hungary. Are you sure? How's it? Two Jim Romes Jungle program. Now we'll be heard live. Artuber 4th. I have no compulsion about promoting this. I've always done that. All the years I've been in here. Promote the competition. Because they all talk a big game. We're going to kick your ass. Artuber 4th. Artuber 4th. The first time I've seen a lot of people who were in the world. I've talked about talk for a few days. We'll be back in the local radio. Phil Hungary who entertained thousands while infuriating many will be heard on Supertalk 940 WI and Z-Edsov. Promote the work on by our company. Recently announced the purchase of the syndication rights to the Henry's daily radio program. Which currently is broadcast on KFI Los Angeles. In South Florida, the show will be heard live. Monday through Friday 10pm to 1am on Supertalk 940. The nightly program will then be replayed weekday even though Phil was in South Florida for relatively short time on WIOD. He made a tremendous impact. There are host on competing stations, Neil Rogers for one, who claim he is the very best. In fact, Neil features Phil on his own website. Did I ever say Phil was the very best? No. Is he great? Yeah. Is he the very best? No. I'll re-playing that I pre-guessed that's program will give thousands of the chance to hear Phil who normally could not. Of course that's because it did not just because people are going to bed at that hour because they're a single at night. But there's nobody can hear it, especially in Broward. Phil is such a major talent that we couldn't pass up having him on the same station with Rick and Sud, Rift Daniels. And Jim Rome. At 12th of the weekdays, the Supertalk 940 will broadcast Jim Rome's the Jungle program. We've been broadcasting the show on a take-delay basis on WIOD. It gets great reaction. The only complaint we've had is that it's a take-delay. My Phil show is going to be in the morning. By moving this program to Supertalk 940, we accomplished a great deal. Many who wanted to hear him and Jim and his colors live will now be able to. The fact that this is an outstanding sports program broadcast when the sports station, WQA is not providing sports programming, is an added benefit to software listeners. Jim is a proven winner. Or a tank calls him, Romey. Romey. No, Romey. The combination of Phil and Jim Rome will be a tremendous one-two punch against the villagers. We will win. That only ask you something. Is there anybody in this audience? I mean, sure. It's especially the beginning. We're going to get a lot of people tuning over there to see what he's doing. And it will be fun back and forth. No problem with that. But Jim Rome and the noon to two hours. Is there anybody? Do we have the sports nerds listening to this show? Do you people over there understand who my audience is? No. You only people ought to be concerned about Jim Romey and on noon to three. I guess anybody is doing sports show from two to three. And the people over there are waffin. What's very jackass? I bet he won't be laughing now. They won't be laughing at waffin. Now they got Jim Rome to deal with against the two live due during midday. To slice up that little pie even thinner. To slice up that one and a half percent even a little bit more. But we will win. Also joining the station line up, starting at 1 a.m. week nights, is talk personality Ed Till. Oh my. Oh. He is currently the late night hosted Los Angeles talk station. KLSX from early in the morning with Rick and Suds throughout the day with Phil Jim Romey. Brooke. Even late in the night with Ed Till. Super Talk 940 becomes an energized and consistent entertainment machine. A big, gigantic entertainment machine. The thing I want you. Just bullbosing you. Bull crapping you with entertainment. 24 hours a day. Rolling over the audience. The daily lot of super talk 940 will be Rick and Suds 6 to 9 a.m. See that now. Why does it say 6? It's 5.39. Even as on memo we can't get it right. Get it right, Bulls. You jackass. You idiot. He's an asshole. He's a Christ. 5.39 a.m. Rick and Sput. I heard that this morning and believe me they need the edit help for me. Trust me when I tell you. Oh, God. Phil Henry 9 a.m. to noon. Are you sure on tape? Jim Rome noon to 3 p.m. Brooke Daniels. 3 p.m. Tom like us. Who by the way will be leaving. He will be leaving. That's right. When is took. It says even on here. It says the like is show contract and soon. They will be replaced. 6 to 10 p.m. Phil Henry alive 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. and Ed Till 1 to 5 30 in a morning. Do you ever heard Ed Till? Let me tell you who Ed Till is. Here is a goal. In fact, I can't get the guy's name. There was a guy who is the PD. Ed W. G. D. S. When we were doing talk. When I was a W. News and this guy was obsessed with me. I mean, just obsessed. Ken molden with another guy's name. I can't think of what it was. But anyway, he used to bring I was working eight to midnight. And midnight when you do it for our show and it's freaking midnight. You want to go and hell home, you know, or go out and eat or something. You want to get out of the building anyway. And all of a sudden, I would look up. I'd be mad. I'm getting ready to get out of there. Which is there with a 350 seven. Magnum or shooting bullets in the wall. And this man he had brings this Ed Till guy in. Oh, he got listen to his tape. He's great. He's going to be. And I couldn't avoid this guy. He kept bringing him by bringing him by and flicking me with Ed Till. This guy. He has worked in Pittsburgh. He's worked in Dallas. He's worked in 8,000 different markets. How I don't know. I guess it goes to sure there's no talent out there. And gets fired everywhere he goes. He is he makes brook Daniel sound like watercrunk. I could feel a lot of conflict. That's how bad Ed Till is. Let me do the break. Okay. Because when we get back, I'd like to challenge you people. Both at patch and then clear channel. I'd like one name, please. One name. Two years now. In fact, it's almost two years today. Because wasn't it right early October that we went over in the patch and took over from a Cox with IOD. Two years later. The patch and people declare channel people with all your resources, with all your ingenuity, with all your smarts. Name me one. One. I'm not talking about opening up a pot and putting Howard on over there on a big. I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about one local talk personality that you put on here that you brought in new. I'm not talking about people that were there already like Rick and so I'm talking about one new person that you brought on who's a talent who has a number who has an audience. Name me one and then we'll do business. This is five, six feet. You way out. I'm having a such a nice time. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. I've got the power to mold into the troll. I'll ride. Oh, have you... Oh, how the way to get your own show. I have a station down in Hollywood. And I don't get it. Oh, ladies and gentlemen, it's one that you can stroke, Eagle. I'm on the same of, baby. And you'll do anything I want, Eugene. I mean, you can sponsor me on a... I don't think your legs are that desire. Oh, the Napoleon. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I got a good spot. I can't believe it, John. That's why I'm like in soaping, because I'm just an ass. I had one in my mouth once. 1045 at 5.60 WQM. So anyways, speaking of Karen K. Anybody heard her lately? Oh, how about Greg? Oh, how about him? How's he doing? How about Mike Church? Oh, no. Now, I don't even know the names. Or remember the names of some of the other people, because I was during my seven multi-edits, when I wasn't here very much. But they have had coming in going a succession of losers. And not the least of which, by the way, who was still amazingly astonishing, part of this great new award-winning lineup. I was a new trend that comes out at 2.30 a day. So I'll have all the numbers tomorrow morning. But there's a new trend that comes out, which would be two months of the summer book. It'll be, uh, June, July and August, which you'll be on August to part of the summer rating book. Okay. I wouldn't be surprised if he always points by now. This is a person who got candy at the first time because nobody was listening to it because he's a no talent bitch. Now, people who runs into across the street from us had tired kingdom one day, while they were getting inflated or something. And oh, yeah, would you like to come back to work? Sure, why not? Okay, great. You know, if she's on the wrong station, notice you ought to be on waxy. But that's an inside joke. You know what I'm talking about? But in any case, so, uh, you know, and here she is taking the rick and such numbers from the afternoon and they're going down and down and down and dropping like a rock. The number of people you could, you could run out of goddamn telephone booth and have room left over with decides that the audio cheese got left. Sure. And let me see it again. Phil Henry, I'm a great talent. And I'll mistake about it. But I'm taking syndicated. Jim Rome syndicated. Brook Daniels, don't belong on a year. Like you syndicated, even though he's going by by. In fact, that's how that's how bad he is that even though it's only, uh, not in the first of October yet, they're already saying they went to contract his up at the end of the year. He's going by by. Art Bill, syndicated. Name me one local person that they've put on a year, Paxton and Clear Channel, who's got an audience. Who means something in this market? Who's a talent? Who's got ratings? Who's bringing in lots and lots of revenue? Can anybody name me one? No. No. In two years. In two years. Nice going, Pete. Excellent. You know what, Pete? You're still an asshole. And as far as this bull crap, you will win. I got news for it. The Jim Rome people aren't any around yours listening audience. Okay. I hate to break the news. Yeah. I know that's going to read. I'm a real man. I can't give a crap less about Jim Rome. And as good as for all of you just getting to the Tom Jick at Pacer, you know? Because it's great. But you know, not stoutes a wonderful thing. And we think back about, oh, wasn't that great when so-and-so was on? But you know, something? Nobody is great all the time. And when you do something that requires the tremendous amount of skill. When it goes over big, you know, like all you can eat and you grow, it's spectacular. You got the audience eating out of the palm of your hand. We're on the floor. We're laughing. We're peeing in our pants. But it doesn't happen that often. Oh, how could you say that? Because it's true. So there'll be some people, especially at a beginning. Like next Monday morning, I'm assuming Monday morning at 9 o'clock. I probably play a show from, I don't know from one Friday night. I have no idea. I'm here to give them all the promotion I can. He's a good guy and a great talent. I have no problem with that. Everybody's got to make a living, you know? Henry Wackiness is backwrites Tom Jika. So anyway, it comes to be two o'clock. The steam is coming out of my ears on Friday about this OJ business. And now George tells me Tom Jika wants you to call him. This is the same Tom Jika by the way that all through the summer. Or I know he's a big shot during the summer. He sent him out there to Sun Sentinel, sends him an L.A. He's got to check out the new TV lineup. He's got to write 60,000 articles about the new TV shows. Because that's television, you understand? We're not important. We're just about to radio nerds. So when the spring raining book comes out, we have another fantastic book here on QAM, especially on the show. Does he write a word about that? No, he's busy in LA. I don't give me wrong. I like Tom. I've always liked Tom. I get along five with Tom Jika, except for the fact that He's a place for that. Hey, it's Tom. He's a kid. Tom, oh Neil, you're the one who would Neil say it about you. I like Tom. And for his kid, that's got nice, so kids. Okay. He does. What are you smoking about his nice kids? I think. I don't know. I don't think I've remit him. But at any rate, don't take it personal. It's just business. It's certainly not personal, even though. The FCC thing that we're allegedly getting signed 35 grand by the FCC for a bunch of innocuous stuff that we played, including the foul mouth dolphin thing that I've been playing for seven or eight years, that he write a word about that. Did he ask me anything about that? What he called me here on Friday, by the way. No. I just don't understand it, Tom. Was there any interest in that story? Oh, major story. Certainly, and there was big enough to be an R and R in the, and the Bible of the business when it first broke that story. That's how we found out about it before the FCC bothered to tell us. And of course, it's still in limbo and lawyers are going back and forth. Can we say, crap, can we take a crap? You know, but it's a big story. Local radio station may get signed 35 grand by the FCC for all those all these things. Tom can't discover. No, I can't find it. No. So anyway, it calls me to a clock to ask me, of course, about to fill everything. Henry Wackiness is back, where it's Tom and Saturday morning's Sun Sentinel. Beginning October 4th, radio rebel returns to local airways and seducated show on WI and Z. Phil Henry is coming back and all news radio is going away in a line-up shuffle involving two prominent radio stations into the Miami-Fortloader of the market. Let me interrupt my reading by the way, because there's an interesting word that Tom uses in air shuffle. What about, what about we said about Pete Poulcher? That's his favorite thing. Shuffle at deck. Shuffle the deck. Shuffle the deck. Keep, he did it when I had the light bulb. Instead of putting somebody on the ear on the edge of a hungry, who might attract an audience under the edge of 200, just keep moving to people around. Speaking back of the old GBS days, when they had their very short live the attempt, their ill-fated attempt at competing in the talk radio market. When they had Alan Burke and David Gold, some of you all far, some remember those days, some of you talk groupies. Remember that? Lee Fowler, Rest in Peace. What they would do is the ratings would come out. They have no audience. One year is 0.5 years stuff like that. They would take the same people and move them around to different day parts. Like, shuffling a deck of cards. That's what Pete Poulcher does. Just keep moving the same people around. Shuffle over here. Put it on the island. Put it on the island. Now, the interesting part of it is, remember when they made the initial shuffle, when they took the all news from my NZ, put that over on IOD. They took the talk from IOD and put whatever was left of it along with their awful retrids and put that on IOD and come up with this stupid talk thing, which people don't even know what the goddamn colors are by the way. Stupid talk. Anyway, Tom Zicker goes on to say, Henry, who's specially is hilarious impressions of three or four wacky characters debating volatile issues left WIOD three years ago to take a job in Los Angeles. He became such a sensation in the nation's second largest market that is sure is now being syndicated nationally. It'll be heard twice a day on WIOD's sister station WIOD and ZAM-940 stupid talk. Henry's live program, aware from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m. a re-run will be presented following weekday morning from 9 a.m. to noon. This will put the final two hours directly opposite Neil Rogers on WCU-AM-AM-560. Rogers, who once was Henry's lead in on WIOD, has been his biggest booster is on faith. Now, here's where we get to where Tom makes a little mistake. Generally speaking, Tom, you usually quote me fairly accurately, but I did not say this. It won't affect me at all, he said. People who want to listen to Phil will tune them in live at night. They're not going to listen to tapes the next day. That's not what I said. That's part of what I said. I said in the beginning there's going to be a lot of interest in people go over in sample and there'll be two in back and forth. The reason that they're going to be tuning in in a morning and Broward at night is because they can't hear the signal at night. Then take a rocket scientist to figure that out. So this is a very convenient excuse for the people of ClearChannel. Say, oh, we're not just right in off-knit or Rogers, because we're desperate, we can't come up with some new talent to put on there against them. And we got to run tapes of the same show from the night before a Phil Henry. But we're doing it as a service to our listeners, because of that crappy signal we got at night that nobody can hear. Getting back to Tom, Jekyll's article he goes on to say. Characteristically, feisty, Roger said as soon as he heard Henry was being syndicated, he expected ClearChannel communications, a parent of WIOD and WIanzi to pick up the show. Their desperate, what else do they have? Sid Neal. In fact, wasn't I saying it almost every day here that they'd have to be crazy not to pick up Phil Henry. Okay. I say that every day. Okay. What's going on? How come we can end? And was I, who was the first one to tell this audience to tell this town that they were syndicating the Phil Henry show? Who was the first one? There you go. Going on to Tom Zikazardical. He also took a swipe at his own employer, meaning me. You can quote me on this. Our worst enemy isn't on the outside. It's on the inside. Rogers was furious that OJ Simpson was playing Friday in a celebrity golf tournament, co-spotted and promoted by WQAM. Two of the current staples of Super Talk, where I said in the bottom, Dr. Laura Slusinger, moving to WIOD, which has been an all-new station during the daytime. WIOD's news blocks have been limited to morning, 5 to 9 AM and afternoon, 3 to 7 PM, and dragged on after a half hour of news. Another half hour, including the 15-minute Paul Harvey reports, will run from 1130 noon. The rest of the day WIOD will also present Talk programs. Limbaugh, Fat A, Limbaugh. We'll continue in his questionnaire, noon the three slimes. See, so like I said, now they're moving this stuff. Back and forth, back and forth, IOD, IOD, IOD, IOD, back and forth, shuffle it up and down the dial. Slusinger will air from 9-1130. A sports talk show hosted by Phil Latchman. Like that. Phil Latchman, there's a guy in OEM. There, that's me. Yeah. You only locally originated Talk on a station. We'll go, oh, how do you like that? The only locally originated Talk on a station, meaning IOD. We'll go from 7 to 10 PM followed by the syndicated art bell coast to coast, also moving from IOD. You have to wall paranoia and conspiracy, if you will discussion of UFOs, alien invaders, and other paranormal activity will be live from 10 to 2. Three hours of Bell Highlights will fill the void to the morning news strike. You've got seven hours of crazy people on the art bell show. Ten of night till 5, and we'll go a bit again here anyway. Thank God. Jim Rome's sports show out of Los Angeles is moving from Taitale in the evening on IOD live in midday on Super Talk. Rome will be heard after the Henry Rhe Run from noon to 3 PM. Broke Daniels are astonishingly at 9-10 doesn't say this but he should say. I'm saying it. I'm astonishingly at amazingly. Shockingly, brook Daniels will continue from 2 to 6 PM, and spread of the fact that he's blown out almost the entire audience. People are heaving. All over time. This would be idea that that not the evening which will still be on air with that cackle that I'm not just sound. That real real I'm not just JAPI sound. He's not broad. The syndicated time like his program will also retain at 6 to 10 PM stop at only till the end of the year when the current contract runs out. A local talk host will be sought to fill these hours and based on their track record I bet it's going to be somebody great. A syndicated program hosted by Ed Till. A new comrade of South Florida. We'll air from 1 to 5 30 in the morning when Rick and Sres will kick off the new day from 539. All the changes are scheduled to go to the next Monday October 4. You heard it here first on Friday right here first on 560 WQAman's spite of our management. This is 560. You way out. One tiger over and on the hanging Johnny fishing rod tally ripper pocket rocket one 1000 trout. A ding dong ankle tiger pork sport engine tiger hairy hunter David pocket let the whole hang out. 10 minutes for janitorial. Just about to go to the club and you got a love of 10 minutes for janitorial. 10 minutes for janitorial. 7 minutes for janitorial. 8 minutes for janitorial. The first cross in Castro. Here you'll see it goes on inner with the generator interior engine pilot. It's like it is all too heavy, with someビX Guest in here. I'm not true there's one more purple home at warrior I'm in the chenetallium She's a little girl, she's got a moment She's got a lot of love on And things that she's got a failure There's always some pieces They go, got in and with these But things for chenetallium She's got a lot of girl, she's got a lot of money What about a one, five, six, you're gonna come and hopefully it's as cool as the second You're the six, talking baseball Oh thank god, we're not gonna be doing too much more of that At least not about Marlon baseball It's almost over, you know, just to all be so good when that pain stops You know, talking baseball would done it be at six And then can you just begin to imagine? How old did you stop putting your thinking cap on right now? Just imagine the number of people that are gonna be sitting gathered around a radio At six thirty night when the pre-game comes up And then at seven o'clock when they throw the first pitch The Marlon's at the Montreal Explode This could be one of the great audiences in the history of Major League baseball I bet you in your broom closet you've got room for more people Then I gotta be listening to Marlon's Explode's baseball at six thirty night Here on WQAM Well the sports embarrassment never stops But at least the baseball ends very soon only six more games And by the way aren't we thrilled that it looks like the Marlon just I could lose 100 games Oh, I just amazing to me, the BS that they try to put over on a public You're supposed to be happy by the way That after losing 100 games last year The Marlon's already 162 and if they win just one more they're last six games They won't lose 100 this year Oh god I got a lot of advice even to get just based on that right now Team that won the World Series three years ago and then uh you know here's here's what you got A little league team Now you'll notice by the way that we took a couple of calls they're early like spontaneously like uh You know a little mini lightning round and it was okay we actually got some good information there But I have a lot to say about what the show is all about and you know something to fill Henry thing I think in a long run I'd be the best thing it happened for me. Are you sure? Yeah positive Because I've actually spent at least seven minutes over the weekend thinking about this Well maybe four or five Thinking about what's wrong you know with the first of all radio in this market is you know sucks to begin with So I think it's great it it it it it it it injects a little bit of excitement again into the whole radio business Even Tom jica how do you like that who's of course much too big for us radio people Even he writes a column Saturday that I just read about a radio event here in this time Once the last time that happened 10 years ago so kiss So it's good to have something something something alive on a goddamn radio It's alive like they said in Frankenstein it's alive Not too often not too many hours of the day But anyway, I was thinking about what's really bad about radio about talk radio anywhere in this town And you know what's really bad about talk radio beside a lot of the so-called talent the calls See there are some people out there. Oh, yeah, for us cars. No, if wasn't for the listeners The listeners are the ones who count 99 and 910% of them who will never call under any circumstances Which is very obvious by the way You can beat him silly with a baseball bat and they still won't call I'm when you stop and take a bite it would most of you call where I call a talk show how many times I call the morning show once when I was driving a work here very early on Some hockey thing was back during the days that we're doing a hose job in Brian Murray and looking his body parts And I called them because I was psychotic over something they said that was back before the days guilty grew up here I was going yelty And thanks for the news that Alan McColley is good to play. Oh, I was very nervous about that But then you don't want to hear about that they didn't want to know who that is But anyway, that's about the only time I can think of in the two years that I've worked here that I've ever called in And why would I well? Well, well, I was well, and in my case, I don't have to wait on hold if I called in the station Somebody else's show like on Hank show and I tell a producer here. It's kneel. Stop. Let me write on here. I don't have to sit and wait 10 minutes 15 minutes But the callers Stop and think about the quality of the call and how many times have I talked about the sports callers Oh, you think that we get bad calls many many days and we do But the callers on these sports shows there were enough to make you want to put a gun to your head for there or both Terminal Ponderous and you think the yelty is we might go to win 20 games and that's one of the better calls Terminal ponderous puke inducing This is the problem and When you're settled with the local market and you've only and again when you don't even have an 800 number See this all goes back again these people who who had a free ride for too long. I'm ecstatic I hope that there I hope they got you when Allison is the standing at the doorway now to greet them every morning I hope they're peeing in their pants Because everybody's coming after this place now and long overdue. They've had a free ride for a long time They stepped into a bucket of and they didn't even know if they couldn't even smell what it was All the news that all this money was rolling in here and all these big ratings rolling in here Especially during the middle of the day and it was the filtering out the other day parts And did they do the smart thing did they do what makes any sense no what they do? I heard managed on Friday Who had a five and a half minute segment not a five and a half minute commercial break? He had a five and a half minute segment it was going on wailing as only he can do About the fact that you know he had done all of this homework and met all these articles and put all this you know Made all these notes for things that he wanted to talk about Friday because he knew he was gonna be doing the show And he said why did I bother I'm only on for like five or six minutes to the time and it's kind of a buffer in between commercial breaks So so basically what we've done here on this stage and I can't speak for any of those We've trained the audience it's like an endurance contest Not only can we get you to call and say something purely intelligent or entertaining or amusing or provocative whatever But can we get you to hold on through some of the longest commercial breaks in the history of the business Certainly in history of AM radio I mean for a long time now FM radio because they like to do those long We got a 20 minute under the rupted music sweep well the reason they can do that is because they jam up a whole bunch of spots Every time they do the commercial break three times an hour So FM has been doing that for a long time just like they do on Howard show but on AM radio the idea of a 13 minute break a nine minute break On the herd of Our tons were just morning before the show back in the IOD days when we used to have a five minute newscast at the top of the arm remember those days Oh If we had three or four people on hold at the end of the hour along we come to newscast and as soon as they heard the idea in the news center And the Henry Burrow's voice or Jennifer whoever was you could watch the lines wrap off and you'd have to start when you come back after the news You know a couple people would call back in you'd have to start over again Because they knew that they were gonna be on for an in terminal period in time plus waiting for you to talk to whoever else was on hold and they just work on a wait In addition to which stop and think about the nature of the people who will wait and who can wait You're fine to follow what I'm saying how often have I talked about that People who wait for like 35 minutes who basically don't have much to say in a minute in a first place I have no life exactly it's like they're holding up a billboard thing I don't have no life so I'll stay on here for two hours if you want me to kneel You'll be sorry when I get on the air because it's gonna be one sorry as call and I'm you know I'm gonna see the colors are what's entertaining. I know that comes to great shock and it's always fun You know I've got this group of people out there that love to give me this song It is oh no you're so wrong. You know what we listen for is you ripping up the colors ripping them in ass That's bull crap That's a lot of garbage I can think of days when I've left here and during the course of those shows and there have been so many of them And people calling and say oh boy sure is tough today on any of these people are sure right so many of those days When you run in one market you don't even have the 800 number like I said to talk to people who may be listening on the on the internet Who may be over and four miles to it to expand the you've you've got to have a ton of people out there if we were You know, you know, sedicated on 25 stations or in five or ten markets and Had an unlimited number of phone calls then you can go through like 7,000 phone calls in an hour. You know I'm talking about But when you're sitting here talking to yourself and you got like one or two people on there and you're pumping the numbers and pump it And I hear it all the time I heard Rick and Sud doing at this morning I would one call on there all the time coming to work I heard the default doing at this morning on the worst thing pumping that number Why The colors generally speaking 80% of them are what they just the pick and number are there the callers suck They have nothing to say They're not interesting. They're not funny. I talked to got a call here at last week or the week before Very early in a show to give me a song to dance about his problem parking and downtown mind and they charged him too much I could sit here and hear radio dials in my head clicking. I could hear the audible sound of people clicking reaching and twisting and turning and yanking their radio is a new opposition That's how boring you were sir. You were just you were puke and do see you were sleeping do sir To be continued 10 after 11 at 5.50 WQ and if you want a great meal by the way speaking at a great meal Before I do the spot for a moment what are we doing for lunch today now that you and I are both porktap Oh, we can write nothing whatever you want. I'm not even you're not eating huh? Painfully fat really can't tie my shoes To go on all eat I guess we can't have Atlantic City Subbs and again, then for you know you're not gonna participate. I'll eat the guts out of it Okay Yeah, you're so full of crack. I'm not eating, but if you're gonna have if you insist You'll eat the guts anybody on here want to bring their guts toward we'll eat them Hello, this is my doll You know a few years ago. I had to phosphate surgery initially. I was very simply about recovering And I began to worry about the post operative side effects like erectile dysfunction ED Sometimes known as impotence also refer to as whiskey winner Legoland soft serve down panors go wildly welly glass and flagpole heading south spaghetti syndrome Went biscuit, you know being down the witch is dead But there is help you need to see it out there with a little courage and proper treatment He can help you achieve an erection sometimes known as a boner often referred to as a spiffy hard time Pocket rocket granting them drop current creak color roll-a-colders a chubby kitchen of tanner being harder than Chinese algebra And when you do get help there's no reason to be ashamed because there's now hope for men and their partners Hope that they'll soon be able to have intercourse sometime known as sex often referred to as the humpy dance bump in ugly side in the salami setting up right the dude's take buggy Getting some on you matching that you know take a trip to the mound So remember it's a little embarrassing to talk about but with a little courage and a few creative humanisms You too can leave behind the soft rock get yourself some heart salami grind the baloney pony into a bright new future I'm Bob though. Thank you. I do like heart salami, by the way. It's 11 16 at 5 60 WQM So here's a fact From one of our fine spotters two wing out John penis by the way Rip in a manaz for not the servicing is account how unusual huh? I don't want to mention who it is on here. So anyway speaking of on here the poor guy bird a stew facts here by the way About the private memo over there at the queer channel Now and this must be this must be from the inside over there. Oh, I don't know He thought he thought he was talking to you the guy that sent me the facts of that memo I was on a airster so you're probably gonna be far. I'm very sorry about that But hey, that's the way it goes when you call a radio station you're probably gonna be on the year I'm so sorry about that. Am I sorry about that? Oh, well, so I go and he probably didn't work over there Probably found it under his like we find all the memos The janitor under the janitor done it the dog done it So anyway getting back to this thing about the phone calls And I noticed by the way as soon as I said that the phone stop ringing entirely which is okay Because I took a few calls there in the first hour. I knew a approach to this show is gonna be unless we get an 800 number Unless we start doing something you know we expand our horizons a little bit. I'm gonna take a few calls here in here And it shows gonna be a lot more me and a lot less of you Oh That's what it needs to be now when you do your fill in you do whatever it has you like you want to you know Go on and talk about you know your experience of this one club and every growth test until that should take about five minutes Just about like it took you But when you stop and think back all these years. I mean the classic the great phone calls that I've had Overall these years 23 years I've been on here in this town How many stand out? the bridge tender The school lady which to be honest with you that that was not that great to begin with and and then the guy that we had which I'll play in a little while I'll kill some minutes the fraternity guy who wants to run naked on the beach with his buddies, which is only a few days ago. We had that one the dingo lady made a problem yeah That's four In 23 years That's like that's like one every six years I'm talking about calls that are really memorable that are either really funny or really provocative or Really something Yeah like that What are every six years do you have any idea how many phone calls you have to go through Just stop and try to figure it out how many calls could you take in six years to go through and come up with the four in 24 years One hell of a lot watch I proved it. WQAM Neil yes, sir. Hey, wow, got right to I think it's a great idea where you're thinking of doing I didn't hear You know the delay to from when I turn off my radio and now but In that moment I don't know well if you added to what you're thinking of doing but I think it's great. I think it's I've been wanting to say that for a long time, but I didn't know how to approach it I mean I got a zillion things to talk about I want the great first iterations of my doing new show Is that I'll sit here most days the first ten minutes 20 minutes a half hour sometimes 40 minutes If I'm on the put a lot of stuff and I'll talk about all kinds of stuff that I think I'm is really important and already get people going and then the first call will be Some crap that has nothing to do it look that other words how many times have you heard me say? I'm doing one show and the cars are doing another show I got there on agenda which most people are interested in what they're talking about exactly that's why I think it's fantastic Excellent, I hope you you know keep it going. Okay. Thanks. Okay. See there you go How many how many if I could count the times out in the amount of frustration that I've gone through because I come on here And I'm just wound up like a maniac and I'm just pouring my guts out here and the first call will be somebody say Or the first call will be but it cone you know like that See I realize that you people meaning you of course and your people you don't have much to talk about that We can relate to besides you know refried beans stuff like that which we don't care about but That doesn't mean that they don't listen they're out there listening they just like most of the other people have nothing to say So when you have nothing to say not it cone. Okay. We got to message the first 45,000 times you know in addition to which We'll got our own I think is much more colorful anyway I just like the way you can roll the R on that look at our own. Oh, I just mmm No, sir. I get I get sexual excitement. I get like oh man Emotional just looking about here and somebody say that and usually the sad part of it is it's always some old stick That's the set see I don't get excited about all anybody especially old sticks Because they're the worst oh man. They you know one more that they don't understand. Oh I told you that before no they don't understand in the vocabulary Not like I said tomorrow I have a meeting tomorrow afternoon to a clock with the powers that be around here and if they want to you know If they want to try to help us just do anything for this show which they haven't done nothing Two years have been here have they done anything other than what they were demanded to do other than what was in writing any slow no And you know what that goes back to it just like your appearance on Saturday at Prime Co Then we had to make you to a big joke here on Friday and mention about 600 times because nobody would tell you anything about it I mean George will take the money. I mean McDonald's take about that because with what he's getting paid around here You take the money too, but Yeah, for for the same amount of effort you can take the money and you can go do something good So the thing I want you come back again someday As opposed to going there walking in the front door with your buddy there and they say Yeah, which makes you feel like you know right from the outset you have a feeling something's wrong here, you know something's not kosher This isn't exactly going to be a major event It's like I said before this Saturday noon to two We're gonna be at the sawgrass at the specs and sawgrass mills mall for our first center one appearance of year We'll have the brand new best in the aline dine And we're gonna also have those keychain things so they're gonna be ready. I hope I have it heard anything negative about it So I assume We'll just said no they won't be had those great little nifty key chains that have buttons on where you can I have all the favorite sounds from this show which are gonna be really neat and nifty But today is Monday. I realize Saturday is a long way away. It's way way down there, you know So God forbid that anybody in promotions or anybody else involved in this thing should give us a little bit more information Or have a memo out on this and you know the little dog made a good point We were out there in a hallway with little gripe session there last third of your Friday About the fact that our promotions people do absolutely nothing zero zippity do do because they're part of the privilege group because they got naked pictures of a Greg But wouldn't it be nice if we had memos about everybody else's stuff Wouldn't that be great so that when a hank is making an appearance? Are gonna be doing a show out at so-and-so or when a Joe was doing an appearance member Joe and Jeldi I think we're doing a thing on Saturday out somewhere which we heard them talking about did we have anything about it in here? Oh, they have anything about your appearance in there. No See there's a word That they don't understand around here and you want to know they don't by the understand because nobody is forced into Understand it. I mean, I feel now like I'm going on this lecture again, but I did two years ago Shortly after I first came here The word is effort Put a little effort into what you do. Don't just show up and take a goddamn paycheck sand put a little bit of effort into what you're doing That's why you know this thing with a golf tournament I could write a whole chapter in a book. I mean a lengthy chapter just about the golf tournament And who was it that wasn't doing a job in promotions? So that Raw came in here on the year that day was a getting into a big flotter was on the air And also happen a throw in oh, how come you don't want OJ is that would aircraft because Roy Ryan OJ Are doing it to him. I think those same person maybe just gain some weight So why did that all transpire because we the the talent none of us were reading a promos on here for this golf tournament that took place last Friday And you want to know why because nobody gave us any information nobody knew what not in about it Because once again somebody who's got a privileged life who's got a free pass who's got a scholarship Whatever term you want to use who's got a job for life Didn't do his job See I have a difficult time reconciling all these things. I really do Knowing that there are some people some of us who come in every day who try to be conscientious We'll really take a little bit of pride in what we're doing even though it's here And then there did a whole bunch of these floaters Floaters People are just kind of floating their way through life taking an easy paycheck getting the latest much as they can get as much head as they can and they're getting ahead in life I guess is there a model And they're enabled to do it With the management that is either weakened spinalists or ignorant or oblivious or Conspiracy or I love what are all these things put to I don't know I think I'll find out tomorrow But it's tragic And like I said before now that you got people coming after you from all different sides Greg They're not just gonna sit back and give you a free pass. It's not like what you do with Sam and some of these other people here just give it him a free ride a free lunch It's not like that There's competition there are other people out there who want those dollars all those millions and millions and millions of dollars that are pouring through this place There are other people who want their peace of the pie So whether it's those goofballs down there with their make-belief station down over at 17 hundred or whether it's a peat soldier who all of a sudden thinks he's a broadcaster Because he can put fuel Henry on for six hours a day and art bail on for seven hours a day and think he's got radio stations Whatever it is It just keeps chopping up and chopping up and divving up whatever piece of the pie you got So the two five share becomes a two one share and then maybe he comes a one-point age here or whatever it becomes I Mean sooner or later somebody's got to like stand up and say, you know Maybe you're what maybe he was got a point instead of just maybe he was a miserable son of a bitch in a heart ass and we hit him like poison And he's a prick maybe it's not a just that maybe he's got a point And maybe some of these people around here ought to be doing something And one of the things that I take the greatest exception to is that when you ask these things like when George had the audacity on Friday to ask well What's gonna be going out there a prime call on me or we give him stuff away and maybe anybody made any arrangement When you ask something like that instead of having somebody say oh, yeah, well, let me get you the answers. It's like oh you make in trouble again You start not again You a little prick Oh, yeah, that's right. You're with Rogers. We should know you're gonna be a pain in the ass. You're part of that routine See we're not playing the game, okay? We're not playing the game. We're gonna do it the right way And if you guys want you know you can you can be left in the wilderness you can be left in the dust in the end trails We're not playing the game 26 after 11 560 WQA in this is the new Rogers show This is your brain Any questions They say our love is taboo What we're doing is wrong But I don't care what they say Because my love is so strong They tell us we should be a shade Well that was an advice But I'm cherish each moment with you So that it's my life You're my prison bitch my prison bitch you're not a life of a man I'm glad we share a prison cell when like go out at 10 I can't get through a funeral now that will be a crime as long as I am through a dream I don't mind doing time Call to your father and prison bitch my prison bitch and I have you know we're friends I got you for a candy box and a pack of cigarettes at first new workers But now you're all my friends I knew that I would kiss you with the end I guess that you were Syndrome Now do Right I'm her freedom bitch y'all prison bitch and your rough I'm only half of the request. How about some of the leaders? I'm tired of this, isn't it? I need to get away. I've been thinking seven years, not even five days. I'm your student. You're me in fall, may I be true? I've been waiting for these markers that you've done. I'm not a half. I thought that I could break away from now on, losing hope. I've got a wide-up in my mouth, so... I'm just a little bit tired of this. I'm just a little bit tired of this. I'm just a little bit tired of this. When I get out, I'm really, you don't stretch. You know what, you're the bitch? My prison bitch, I'll never take a bite. You're not like all the other two bad dayheads. You're not like that, they had two bad days. On the second spot, I'm free of fat. If you want to kill your prison bitch, you'll never be in a new world. You're a person with a little name. But now you're my soulmate. Stop, stop, stop, stop. I'm a little dirty. You're not the one that caught you. You're a criminal. You're about to find out whether you're always the polky. You're a criminal. You're about to find out whether you're always the polky. 1134, 550, WQM. I'm sitting here at a few light. Here it is. We've been on for an hour and 35 minutes. What did I take? Two or three calls? And at first segment, just because they had the delivery. And that was it. Have I given the numbers that one? No. You're like, oh, God. Thank you very much, Pete Volser. Thank you, Phil. Are you sure positive? Yes. You get a little thargic after. I know it's easy. You need to get into a rut. You come in every day and you go through the same repetition. And it's terminal and it's pond. And you fight with the audience. And you fight with the audience. Are you going to respond to this? No. You're going to respond to that. No. Shut up. Okay. They just have gotten off of the same. They got no material. How many? How many days did I say to your saying? I've spent half of my time today begging for phone calls. Try to get a response. Day after day after day of my life. I mean, how many times did I, I mean, if we did make a little bit of progress, I'll say that. With that fraternity thing. That was about the 800-time I've tried. To get that top and go on. It gets to me to respond to the hazing and the kind of embarrassing and humiliating. Almost always sexual and nudity involved a crack that goes on with these guys. Boys will be boys and play with boys. And we finally got a not a tremendous response. Not a spectacular response. But last Wednesday and Thursday we finally got enough of a response. So we got one call in the vault of this worth here and again. About the got a the macho guy, the fraternity guy, the wants to run naked on the beach with his buddies. There's nothing like it. Yeah. Oh, and by the way, a little addendum to that. So remember he was asking me about do I have best friends? And I said yes to one is straight one is gay and I haven't seen either one of them naked. You remember the response? So I get a phone call from one of your very best personal friends one day late last week. I don't want to say who it was. Somebody you admired tremendously. Somebody who I know is just dying to buy you once one of these days. Or maybe breakfast. I think breakfast is going to even cheaper than lunch. Yeah, like at the drive to you when the burger king, you know, one of those things are. Remember. And he says to me, oh yeah, who with coer those two people you were talking about, your best friends? Not now you see you're already laughing. Well you you you'll die. You'll just die when you hear this. I said my friends Dave and my friend John. Oh, I thought that was your best friend. Oh, I thought that was your best friend. I thought that was your best friend. Oh, I thought that was your best friend. Or his chains under were three times in the last 16 seconds. Is that the most? I mean, yeah, the rumors are good friends to mind. Are nice people, especially Mrs. River Ferrell, wonderful person. River he's, you know, he's what he is. But I mean, this to me was. And he was serious. That's the best part of the whole deal he was serious. He was serious. My best close personal friend, Jeff Irmer. And the light bulb. It is really just, he was serious. I thought I was your best friend. First of all, I mean isn't that a little bit juvenile anyway, the side of you? I mean, do you have friends that you're all my best friend? You're very best friend. That sounds like really, um, I'm doing that for me. I'll be your best friend. Yeah, right, right. To buy me another meal, I'll be your best friend. Have you do the? Twenty-two till noon. And by the way, I understand through the great find that they had an eight-minute commercial break this morning. And that's because the log is like today, by the way. But of the eight minutes, five minutes were live spots. Now see, this is a problem. When you got three guys on a show. And they're all doing live commercials. This is what you got. So they can bitch in Monalay, one about that format, which I do understand. I think Hank's got a more legitimate beat because he's not doing, you know, he don't have a bunch of little, uh, underlings under the table or do other live spots. It's like when the sales department was approaching you through live spots. And where were we going to stick those, huh? Where were we going to stick them? Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's what I told them. Where's George going to be easy? Taking my avails away so he can be doing live spots. That what's going to happen? Oh, no. See, I think what they had in mind is that every commercial break I would do a live spot in the beginning. And then you would do a live on the middle, maybe at the end. It would be good. Because I want to do two and one break, but that way we can have you do one and every break. And you know, since we're not taking a whole lot of phone calls on issue anymore, what we can do is we can start bringing some people and maybe we can bring the bird back. And he can do some live spots. Have all gold stint come on, he can do a live spot for our school magazine. There you go. Now we're talking. Jim, managed to talk. Oh, oh my god. Right here. A sports radio Bm6. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. A. was a hero by millions across land. And when two visitors, they twice now, she was hanging with another man. But you're swim home now for a night-fest and a pair of gloves and back he went. She was tipping her friends away and giving more than 15 percent where she was going to take. Start a sight-to-end act and don't you know? Was that the air force before they fell? She made a shutdown in O Chicago. Oh, it's acting like this. All about hotel, but the LED-A. Well, he flagged OJ, publicly-composted your roofing with a night that's a prison-yard penalty. Just that we come big-shone. That's what's yet when you pack the waves. I don't hear it everywhere. In a get-a-web-rime goal, pressing something to his goal. Wishing he was dead. But it was a cell phone, known not a pistol, to a side-by-sumo. He's been his dead. Oh, where the finally got a knock. Now it's up to the jewelry, but he was surely being jailed for life. I'm out of people and I'm fed. They feel bad for OJ. They feel get-to-date OJ. Oh, the hack-to-web. The hack-to-web. He's got a homemade OJ so black. Time takes care of everything. That's what I hear. 15-2-0-5-60 WKM-Hank-Goldberg, a school of stake 2-2-1-clock after that. We got, you know, talking baseball. We got the Marlon crap again, but it's almost over. Thank God. Just hang on tight. It's almost over. The embarrassment. So anyway, the scuttle about around the ability here at 2-1-1. The scuttle about seems to be with this OJ business that our general manager was aware of this ahead of time that this whole business of him coming up there in a limo was a pre-meditated act. Orchistrated by person or persons within this building and that our general manager was either a party to it or was aware of it at the very least. Again, that's only the scuttle, but I have no, you know, no way to verify that. Would that be embarrassing? Yeah. Humiliate. Yeah. Rotten. Would that be an act of ultimate stupidity? Yeah. Why is it? That some people don't understand. That almost everyone, almost every white person, anywhere there's some, you know, and most black people, there's some black apologists out there, who want to continue that racial thing, you know, because he's an awful dark. But most people, I don't encounter anybody outside this building, who apologizes for him, wants to see him, wants anything to do with him. I only encounter people that wish only the worst for him. Like real bad, our theoretic needs. It was a good start. Like living in a world where nobody wants to talk to him. He's never just hot-pitched that he's doing, I guess the, I look like blonde, then a cool look alike. I guess finally mama made her a dump in, okay? So we've got some new white chicks, some brunette. That according to our spy reports is a real knockout. That's what we're here. And at least he's got good taste. That's one thing we can say for O.J. Even though he may be a miserable son of a bitch, and murdering a bastard, he's got good taste. Can we agree on that? Okay. No? Oh no, yeah, he's got good taste. But the horse. Yeah. Well, if you're going to screw horse, you might as well pick out one that look good. So be more selective when you go to Amsterdam. Okay, don't just take the first one on the first window when you turn the corner there and red light district. Chop around a little bit. Pays off an end. So to speak. So speaking of scumbags, by the way, we're going to have to, we're going to have to get to somebody in here to investigate that whole situation when we get to the bottom of it. Of course, we probably never will because it's that little conspiracy again, you know? That closed little fraternity in the, yeah. But anyway, speaking of scumbags, so here it is on the front page of our papers this morning. Nice going, Jimmy. Jimmy, we could be special Johnson. Dolphins rookie, Demetrius, under what is in a lancing Michigan hospital after suffering a life threatening stab wound to the neck. Police are still investigating whether the stabbing was self-inflicted. Ow! Under what was found outdoors on Sunday, near the home of the mother of his two children, a day after his arrest for a failure to pay child support. Ow! Now, let me ask you this. How come all these jucks who are making all of this money? Getting paid certainly more than your average slimes out there on the street. How come so many of them just do not want to be a pain or transport? The arrest in subsequent standing are two more incidents in the Bazar saga that's unfolded since under what disappeared after his first day of training with the Minnesota Vikings. He was then picked up by the dolphins as you know, because Jimmy never met a criminal scumbag that he didn't like. They didn't want to give a second chance of third chance of fourth chance and a fifth chance. Nice going, Jimmy. You could be special Johnson. WQAM. Yes sir. How are you? Pretty good. Listen, a couple of things they got to talk to you about. It seems like every radio station, that's just the ones you're on there. They're all they, they all are incompetent or people that work. They're always incompetent. They can't do, they're even just the north. How are you even trying to profit? Isn't it beyond me? The second thing. You said they're making a profit with all the money that they're given away in John Henry. Well, like I said, not just your station. Yeah. The other thing is I know you're ripping OJ a lot. Did you have a catch-up best son of our live last time? Did you watch her? No. They had this great skit and they had the guy pretend he was OJ and he's interviewing more or leaving. He says, here's the play and he draws the play out and they show her the screenings and I did it. It was beautiful. Oh, I'm going to have to send you to the tape of it. It's excellent. I love it. You can't spell scum without you, M. Okay. Too bad about those hurricanes. I feel like I feel a lot of employment between my thighs. It must be because they're her or co-invasties. Carolina this weekend. Blue that big lead there late in the game. What a shame, huh? See, one of the reasons, one of many reasons that I despise the whole university of Miami athletic program but especially the football program especially. I mean, the baseball program I worked with for six years. I don't despise them. I wish nothing would look good luck but nevertheless. But to rest of it to them, especially this football thing because it's phony. It's make believe. It's everything that's wrong with this town. Is the UN Football program. Phony people, bandwagon jumpers. Waiting to jump on hop aboard. Oh, look at this. I want a couple of games. They want to big upset over a higher state to first give. And then they've lost a couple of games. Now you'll see how fast that caravan will just crumble. And the saw does because it's make believe. It's fake. It doesn't exist. There's no great support. There's no groundswell support for you of M sports. It's a make believe university. It's not even a real campus. A big percentage of those kids, the ones who are from down here. They all live at home. It's nothing university. WQAN. Well. Yes, sir. Can I speak to you? Speaking. Yes. Yes. Your career is over. Yeah. And co-hangers get a destroy you. Is that why you're listening this morning? Well, until he gets your job. Really? Until he gets your job. I'm sorry. It's the best I can do. Okay, pal. Sorry. We'll try to entertain you this week. And then goodbye. My career is over. See, and there's one of the losers I'm talking about. There's one of the guys that are going to pump in a number. Pump in a number. To get this guy on there. So we can abuse me. See, DNA student-old harm. And the other part is just as important. T.N.C. That's my philosophy in life. And the idea that I got to sit here degrading and humiliating myself and pump an out begging people to say something so that they can call it, oh, you suck. I'm listening. I listen every day. And even after Philoson, I'll still be listening. Even though I lie a lot about it. You're not going anywhere, pal. Okay. You're listening to Phil for a couple of days. Then you'll be dialing back and forth. Diddle in a run. And you'll be back here. Like most of everybody else will. Every time they put anybody on. They're always going to be fat ass limbo. You're scared, Neil. Are you scared? Don't take it personal, Neil. Yeah, I was real scared when they put fat ass limbo on there. Just like I was real scared when they put Howard on him. He's, you know, because his ego is so man-less. You know, if I were making a money that he's making, I don't think I would need to be on the next or 40 minutes, 45 minutes, whole hour, you know, between 10 and 11 o'clock. I don't think I need to feed my ego that much. Was I a scared of that? No. Did we beat him in that hour and every book since he's been on? Somehow with all the stuff that they've thrown, fat ass limbo, Howard, all these other people, here we still are. And the numbers keep getting bigger and bigger and bigger. In fact, the ratings have gone up since Howard came out in the market. Mine numbers have gone up. Even though he is on, whatever long he isn't that 10 o'clock hour. And since fat ass limbo came on here. You know something, sir? I wish you all the luck in the world because retards like you. More power to you. I won't miss you. I have always said before to people that call this show. Oh yeah, I'm leaving now. It's been like the asshole. Let's send me that facts. Who's wasted 14 years of his life? Screw you, Neil. Yeah, that guy. Screw you. Because I have a different opinion. So screw you. Because you'll have the audacity to criticize anything about America. You're a simple dude in Pal, you're an idiot. And you're still listening right now. I bet my life on it. I bet somebody else's life on it, like I said. You're listening right now. There is no doubt in my mind. Send me a, uh, uh, uh, here's enough to send me the very best because I had the audacity to tell something he didn't want to hear. Emotional cripples, children. Here's Bob Barb by the way. You know, the, speak of the phone calls. Going back to the TV show on whammy. How many times did I beg them? Why are you doing that? You only got a half an hour show. Such is the abortion that they were putting on here. But you're bringing up the video, the audio, the editing, everything about that show was a nightmare. Was guaranteed to fail from the start. But why would you take out a four hour that you're taping every day? Why wouldn't you just take my sitting there and doing the various tirades that I'm going on and talking and saying whatever the thing? That's what the real Roger show is. Oh, no, Maddie Leishon. He wants us to put phone calls in there. By the way, anybody seen him lately? Oh, he's gone. He's out on his ass. Wouldn't know a guy damn TV if they stuck it in his back. Go, that's right. Had to put phone calls on there. Long, pond risk, tedious phone calls. I'd be watching that thing and I'd be screaming at the set. What kind of editing job is this? Why are you putting this crap on the show? Gueranty to fail. Because of, in part, I mean, all the other zidian things that were wrong with it. But especially because of the phone calls that they insisted on putting on there. I know I sure found a captivating. So anyway, here's Bob Bar, which I wish we had the TV for only a couple of seconds. So you can see how good he looks with that little mustache. Can you see what I say today? The voters in Washington DC had an election last November, which is the American F. And why are they voted? Yes. They voted yes to legalize marijuana for medical use. Just like they're doing all over the country, by the way. Arizona, California. And Bob Bar, because he's such a good he too, she says, Oh no, you can't do that as evil. So he had reduced the bill in the house to bar funds for the medical marijuana initiative. So here's some letters to the editor in USA today. In response to this fascist, this Nazi bastard Bob Bar. Kirk News invented Hoover Washington says, obviously the voters of Washington DC didn't know what they were doing. When 69% of them voted legalized marijuana for medical use. Obviously lawmakers can't allow adults citizens to make their own decision this to which herbs are drugs to use. Otherwise, it would send the wrong message to children that the constitution bill rights really mean what they say. Obviously the signers of the Declaration of Independence didn't know what they were doing when they declared that the right to life liberty in the pursuit of happiness is inalienable on self-evident. Obviously they should have added an exclusion for herbs and drugs that can harm nobody except the users themselves. Ryan Heygood and Greenville, South Carolina rights. My father died of cancer. The end of his life was quite painful, but he wanted to and did spend every last day that he could on the surface with his loved ones. One major factor that contributed to his prolonged life was marijuana. Oh, marijuana enabled him to fight off the nausea from the chemotherapy, making it easier to keep down his food. My dad was lucky that one of his positions was compassionate enough to recommend marijuana in the first place, or he most likely would have died sooner. There are untold numbers of people in this country who suffer the effects of chemotherapy, while coma and the side effects of drugs used to treat AIDS, these same people could benefit from the positive effect of marijuana. Representative Bob Bar of Georgia was quoted as saying that it would set a terrible message to America's young people if we allowed license positions to prescribe medication that in their professional opinion would benefit a patient's health. I truly hope that Bar never lives to the pain my father did, or the dangers and the degradation that my family endured to acquire the best medicine for the treatment of a loved one. And Bill Hurt, of Lexington Kentucky, pardon the name rights. The people of Washington DC had their votes counted on medical marijuana issue. The voters spoke clearly with a landslide victory for personal freedom and a reputation of overprotective big brother government. The voters are speaking clearly. Are there any politicians out there listening? No. No. Especially that trash that little Nazi Bob Bar. Nice mustache by the way Bob. Oh! 1157 at 5.50 QAM. Hi, Felicia. Gini, I love your dress and your hair looks so shiny and manageable. Are you still shampooing with head and shoulders? I've got you. I've got you being head and shoulders a long time ago. I mean, honestly, who's dressed there on their shoulders anyway? Yeah, right. So what are you using now? Well, it's light-chegging shoulders only without all those additives. It's just Bob Chad. Let's tell him about it. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. You're a little bit too old. But is it expensive? Now that all cheques, I'd rather says there are places downtown where you can get head for less than $10. Dollars. That's that price. Everyone should be getting head. That's right, Jackson, when you say head, you set a mouthful. I am Dr Raymond Belotty. For example, least. Here's the tells you why you should get head. First of lubricates each limp hair follicle, leading an erect listening shaft. Then the scalp's natural oils are sucked out of the roots, leading your hair soft shun and exhausted. Nothing does the job like head. Great. Can I get head from my hairdresser, Bruce? Probably. But you might want to try your girlfriend first. So I'm going to get the head to get a hair. And then work. So the mom on my head. So the better end of the winter lift. Yeah, can you get head. You're a lucky step. What hair with lots of volume? Nothing gets it up like head. Available to price, you won't find hard to swallow. And it's going down every day. Honey, we're out of tempo. Can you go out and get some head? What did you say? I said, I want you to go out and get head. Oh, thank you. Sweet Jesus. I'm going down town. And that makes a great holiday gift. Last Christmas, my wife gave me some head. Then I gave her a girl necklace. I've never seen her so choked up. My girlfriend used to give me head. And then we got married. Now I'm lucky if I get a girl in lotion and a national view. Right? I'm so happy that people want our job. Oh, can't be a good step. My love, your life's up. And in the shower, your one-up pump. And the last one. Oh, my God. If we try it out, you'll get to it. And get a red veil and feel it. So can you get a peanut butter? The butter is bad. And it's the best. You get the head. You get the head. You'll feel better if you get the head. Oh, yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Head shampoo. Come on. Give it a shot. Oh, hi, here it looks great. You're the man. Double five to five, 60, WQM, 56750, 560, on the AT&T wireless line. We'll think of it. Yeah. WQM. It's like to speak to me. Speaking. Hey, you know, how you doing, sir? Okay, sir. Hey, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. There we go. See what I'm saying? This is beautiful. Perfect. What a great set up this was. WQM? Yes, I'd like to talk to you. I'm simply speaking. Anyhow, you don't want to talk to me. Okay. How's everything? Great. Listen, I hear you a little hostility this morning. How's it going? How's it going? Well, the cause and everything. I mean, I've been trying to pull a warning. I'm just lucky I got through right now. Yeah. You know, I know that a lot of assholes out there that Colin should know reason, but, you know, What do you got for us, sir? Actually, what I wanted to know is, here you were talking about that. Now I want to think, uh, not to long go. Um, just say how to dedicate, speaking of the, uh, government, you know, decided to legalize now one in the state or actually in the state of, you know, all the states. Yeah. What about, uh, what about drug tests? I mean, how would that go? I mean, would that be legalized like alcohol? I mean, you have so many alcoholists, but yet, you know, have them just so for alcohol. Yeah. Well, if it's legal, why would there be a test for it? Well, I'm being that, you know, what it, you know, Do they have a press to see V8 rise? Chris, please in a morning? Good boy. That's why I just wanted to get your opinion on that. Okay, don't need too many home and touch. Next for a meter, pal. I would get there. Poppy seeds will kill you every time. Okay. How would that work by the way, George? Ha ha ha ha ha. First you got it. Yeah. First you got a P. WQAM. WQAM with the radio officer. Good. Ful Henry. WQAM. Yes, sir. Sorry about that. Neil, how are you? Okay, fine. The meat you sunned a wood had is next flashed. Yes. And where was O.J.? They were fighting over the knife. Apparently so. O.J. was at the QAM Gualt tournament. Logo Mar. I'd like to call somebody a douchebag. I'm showing that. I forgot about that part. Thank you, sir. God bless you. God bless you. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. There's another part of the calls that I just love. That just, you know, I don't understand how this show is even still on the ear to be honest with you. What the, you know, seriously, what the call is it done to me over these last many years. It's a miracle. Between some of the bosos that I work for and these great cults. I like to call somebody to do something. At first of all, does anybody know anything? Have any idea who you're talking about? No, do they care? No. No. Does it contribute anything? Is it entertaining? No. Is it amusing? No. Is it hysterical? Is it a peenier pants? No. Is it anything? No. Besides pondress and terminal and embarrassing and humiliating. And have a nice day, sir. And thank you so much. Because that was one of the, I'm sure that there are others that will pop into my mind. WQAN. Anyhow, how's it going? Okay, sir. Good. Hey, did you hear about that, uh, the stabbing, huh? Yeah. Where you fudge packin? Uh-huh. WQAN. Hey, you know, how you doing? Okay, sir. Ah, there's a little moment that's coming Saturday that no one's talking about. I wonder what you know about it. Yeah. The dancers are opening up the NHL season Saturday. Uh-huh. They're trying to keep it a secret of both on your station and throughout the, uh, South Florida community. Yeah. Uh, look at, you know, if we aren't sure about Pavelle's name, maybe we'd better keep it a secret. Especially since the team never won an exhibition game. Oh, I see a vision season. They had a perfect season. Can I tell you, my theory? Yes. Uh, you know, the new eaters from the Murray Brothers is that they have to speak English. I think they have a long language. You don't have to speak, uh, eaters or something like that. Because obviously they're not communicating, but nothing is said. No one has said anything about this. And last season, you had to go through these guys. Uh, well, what do you mean, nobody can't say anything about it. Nobody cares. Don't you understand? I'm, I'm almost as grateful to you as the last guy with a douchebag thing. This is another thing. What's the point of doing a whole hockey song that nobody hears? Yeah, but I think I think it's just one more thing, but I want you to tell. Um, I think that they're in trouble the Murray Brothers because this year, the season, the season ticket sales have gone down. Yeah, that's right. And I think that in other words, the third season of not missing the play. Of missing the play, I've got her. We'll translate into Wayne's anger. Mm-hmm. Especially with tickets sales. I'm so really correct. No question about it. I'm packing sandwiches for right now as a matter of fact. Yeah, why, I, it looks just a little bit back. Okay, I'm on that. See you Saturday. Saturday night, he's right there. Washington, capsule, but you're going to start the big hockey season. Any interest out there? Oh, anybody care? Oh, anybody talking about anybody fired up about Pablo Burre? Oh, anybody. No. Scorless tie in Louisville last night. Niceville predators. I'd be like that. They've been working. I got to, I got that here. They've been working to create this minor league affiliate Louisville. Get the people all turned on the hockey. They play the Nashville predators. And the article says one of the worst games in the history of the human race, a scoreless tie. That would be like going to the swing club and not even getting to watch. Much less swing it out. Exactly. What's the point? A Japanese knows the scores. Starting at 10, so the last 10 and week night. Only on SportsReheal 5, we can 8 out. Freedom and safety. Hi. I'm Aaron Summer. Do you know what? You got me talking on the passion song? Tony is a story about how you got blown. I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. Hopper. Boo! I'll tell you one more before I came up the phone. I got you down. The lines are jammed up. Yeah, there isn't a doubt. Call up and tell me what is on the bound. I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. Hopper. Oh. I'll tell you what's more before I came up the phone. I got you down. I got you down. I got you down. I got you down. Hopper. Hopper. I got you down. Hopper. I got you down. Here on the show there's a near topic each night. Don't you hear a sex with with a blacker with a whiteer? I got you down. Yeah, yeah, holy cow. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. I got you down. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. Hopper. in misery is over and it didn't seem pretty right Michael Russo and a son sent a list morning. The Panthers put years of hard work in energy in a bringing in a mercenary gulfalia to Louisville Kentucky, but on Sunday night, for many of the almost 7,000 that freedom all, their first taste of hockey was the sport and it's worth, it tasted like crap. What they saw were two teams, the Panthers and Nashville predators that were content to play out the string and ensure that nobody got hurt before opening night. The game was chipy and excruciating to watch it times virtually nothing going on, the fans didn't even get to see a goal in 65 minutes, as maybe appropriately the Panthers and predators entered winless and left winless after a 0-0 tie. The only real bright spot was solid gold tending by Trevor Kid for the Panthers. A 0-0 tie. As the Panthers go through the entire exhibition season without a single win, and as long as the Panthers and the Panthers are in the same position, they're going to be a good game. So, it's a good idea to play the game. I think it's a good idea to play the game. But if he goes down, that would be a few way in. Hi, yes sir. I'm calling for a lot of it. Speaking. I was going to talk to you. Speaking. That's Neil. Yes, I am. Didn't sound like you. That's me. How you doing? Great. You're going to be a story for you. You didn't have to see the sports page in the air all today, did you? Yes, I did. What did you think of Dan LeBasterd's column? I mean, did you see? Well, there was my mind. Well, it was about the Marlins and the amazing thing about it. You wrote something that actually made sense. I know it's the first, and I hope you're sitting down one year. I'm holding on tight, man. I'm just kidding. He was talking about how John Henry, in effect, is blackmailing the public in the buying estate. He ended the column by saying that when you blackmail somebody don't have to care for the blackmail to be affected. Right. And I thought he had to never run on the head that people in this community should vote carrying more. That's right. They've blended any of it for affection that you're serious. They've made a mess for that team completely out of the buying public. And I think that is a bit of a big piece. Both of you. OK, your phone just the crap down. But thanks, and I got to write here. I think that was probably John Henry screwing up our phone system. Everybody's got their finger in our phone. And I'm saying either that or in there. Right, go one of the other. Marlins have many questions, no answers regarding the next season. In order for blackmail to work correctly, doesn't the party being blackmailed have to care as to handle a bastard. And like you guys says, after writing 6,422 columns in which he basically said nothing except I'm a professional Cuban. He finally writes a column, which maybe he says something here. About how the big payroll of Atlanta and all the youngsters in the organization and about how they keep bringing along all these great players and the audience. Well, guess what? Nobody cares. You're right, Dan. You could have said it in like, do words, nobody cares. Even my good close personal friends who rising her that we've been rafing about how she actually is written a couple of columns this year. So I actually look at her column now. She's got his is in kisses this morning, which is what these columnists do when they really got nothing to write about. She gives, and I listen to this. She gives a kiss to the Florida Marlins who's win Saturday against the Colorado Rockies, are sure they're losing no more than 100 games this season, with six away games remaining the Marlins of 162 and lost 94. And they've had only a few more fans than that left in the stands. Whatever that means, 62.94. Last that sound more like a hiss than a kiss. Let me just add that I was one of the oil fans who was there for the season's opening day. There at Sunday's final home game, and there for a lot of games in between says Sue. I have one question for us. We'd art. You know what the question is? Why are you there? What's the point? And then of course later on down in the middle of the column, which most people have already that far down, she does a tone for that for her weakness for a minor league baseball against by saying she gives a hiss. Here's that serpent. A hiss to anyone, including Florida Marlins owner John Henry, who would seriously consider putting a baseball estate to state him smack in the middle of downtown Fort Lauderdale. And totally redeems herself by saying don't even think about it. I must be crazy. I must be not. You are man. You're out of your mind. You're off your rocker. Like I said seriously, we are broadcasting a ball game, which we have a contractual commitment that we have to carry tonight. And like I said, is the albatross around the neck of this place. But if it wasn't that Greg Reed would find something else. He'd find some other way to do it. Because it was like with this ojation thing, he knows how to shoot himself in the foot. He's got the gravy train here, baby. He's got a free drive rolling this time. He just keeps shooting himself in the guy's hand foot. Just like those Cubans that go out in the Everglades and keep doing the same. Two thousand of foot, you know. Cubans come and rescue us and that's the name of the organization. Cubans come rescue us from our own and also 60 seconds. Yeah, right. I thought that was something that you mixed with water in the drink as a shake. Put it in the blender. Which by the way, speaking of losing weight. Great article in New York Times yesterday. See, and I realize no, but you know, this again today, except in one guy that made this an income at about marijuana and how would the drug test work if it were legal? Nobody's got any comment about anything I've said here today. I did it to our monologue of this morning. And they still got nothing to say about any of it. But here in yesterday's New York Times is a spectacular very important article that tells you how to lose. How does not just lose weight. But how to stay alive like extend your life by a third as much as 25 years. True diet. Wanna fight out? Well, just wait. Well, Sarah got a hold. Something back here. Can't you be all the good stuff right out the bat? Christ Almighty, it's only Monday. We're easing into this. Hey, New York, can I call somebody a doospect? No, no. No. boring. Terminal. Duke inducing. I apologize for all the years that in my weakness. You know, I have a weakness for my children like Don Corley on said. So I spoil them. As you can see, as you can hear, but this madness stops now. Yeah, that's right. Stop now. Can I call any a doospect? No. No, you can't. Call them up and call them a doospect. If I better, yeah, come off and tell them. He's an asshole. Call them that, okay? Tell them that he's a raving flaming asshole. And then call us back and let us know what a zoo response was. If you're still around. W2AN. Yeah, let's be going to the neighborhood. Yes, sir. Speaking. How you doing? I didn't want to bring up the Acon Sing Jam, but you turned me on to a couple years ago. It's done very well when you can stay on it. Right. Date lines tonight. They didn't come right out and say, they're going to be talking about Acon. But they did a promo on the Sunday night. Network, whatever they're on. Right. Saying, you know, all these bad diets, you're shedding the pounds and eating whatever you want. You're eating all the protein and fried foods. And they show you, you know, they show a splash of picture of a big steak. And they show a picture of a frying bacon and eggs and then shed its shedding the pounds like water. Is it really good for you with all the protein? I don't know what it's going to be about, but you might want to take a look at that tonight on date line. What time's it on? I think it's nine. Okay. All right. That's it. Thanks. There you go. You're like kids people out there. We got a million kids people in this audience. And many, many of them are losing weight. A lot of the rest of them like me are just spinning their wheels. Because some of us just can't do it. There's a local way minutos to carbs. But if it's priced differently and sell само the calories, it's going to be a little market rég. jotka is perfect even if they burn. And we're just under the weight level taking 1970 or 95лат cells and letting them add that thanks. All right. This is my favorite from Logoy community. Finally set your average weight lost in Canada. Lots of было could skip. But you have to buy four rights. Not only do we buy and say we're getting beat in Canada? especially in the middle of our lunch time because then it might have to eat a little bit less. WQAM. How are you, sir? Great. Good. That's what I mean. What do you mean? No, it's not what he's. Okay. That's like it. No, it's not me. Are you related to what he? No, not at all. I have no wordy, but no, not what he. Okay. Listen, you guys are talking about all this food and stuff. It's really making me hungry so full of the dieters, your dishes. Anyway, was that Atlantic substance you were always talking about? Hollywood. Yes, well, I'm going to be in Hollywood in the next 10 minutes. I'd like to go ahead. Park Road in Sheridan. Park Road in Sheridan. That's great. Yeah, so I'll just tell him you sent me there. Please. Can I just get a big, uh, oh, my. That was him. 560, 550, 550, 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. We're making a segue today. We're starting a little bit of a transition with the show. We're going onward and upward eliminating the douche bags is what we're doing. We're cutting up the douche bags from this show. Not a cone. WCYN. Yes, sir. Please don't leave. Okay, Pete, I'm not going anywhere. WCYN. Yes. I got asked a really hard question. Uh-huh. Who is the biggest douche bag? OJ or Reverend Jesse Jackson. I saw him this morning. Maybe that could happen. I want to call in sick when I saw that. He didn't come out on the news when that whole bottle of water was coming. Who bombin' us up there? There are a couple of bombings up at the family, you up there and tell her, has he? Right. And so he comes up there. And let me ask you to give like a snake in his pants or something. What is that all about when he starts shaking? What is that call besides the St. White is dance? Maybe that's the Holy Ghost. Is that what it was? That's what maybe that then bed bugs were starting to act up again. He didn't come out anything about the Colorado incident or anything like that because those were all white folks up there. Is that what it was? I, and then I had, I saw that piece at the end after he finished doing his shaking bakery team and he was doing his interview, you know, his 8 million interview and talking about the anti-Semitic act there in Los Angeles, you know, the Jews that got killed. And I thought to myself, boy, talk about the popcorn and kettle dark black. Yeah, right. Black, those Jews that got killed in Heimi town. You know, we're talking about that again. He sees pathetic man. Makes me sick. One of the great exploiters in the history mankind. Hey, another person that makes me sick is Michael Irvin and I was wondering if you could play, you had some, I don't know, you got a few Michael Irvin, that's what you got one about the Michael Irvin school or something and it has something to do with crack cocaine. Yeah. Can you play that man? You got it. Because I hate the cowboys. They suck. Okay. All right, buddy. See him. That's what Detroitman does. That's what we hear. He sucks. 560, 550, 560 on the 18th, where I was lying 26 past noon at 560 WC. Is there any special reason why we're just leaving those? I mean, I'm not in a hurry to eat, but it's just the way you're going to bring him in there during the break and, you know, I don't think so. Are you just looking for a Lauren like you're going to sit there and look at them? Kind of like they look really nice. They do look good. In fact, you know something that I think maybe that's the answer. That's how you lose all the weight. Don't eat the food. Just look at it. Yeah. I die it. That's right. Don't put it in your mouth. Just look at it. Yeah, but it looks so good. Looks so appetizing, you know. And the food too. Prop 30 at 560 WC. I maybe somebody in the audience knows the name of that thing. So I can play it for that guy because we're scratching our hands. I don't know what the name of that thing is. The LT and Mike. And by the way, let me say it again, in case you missed the earlier part of the show, Lawrence Taylor and OJ were at our golf tournament on Friday. Oh, I did log home. Which were very embarrassed and humiliated by both, especially by OJ, but only slightly beyond my LT. You know, man, this whole jog thing, man. It's sick. You're right about that. It's a sickness. No matter what kind of a scumbag you're dealing with, no matter how many murders, how much coke, how much Joe whatever. What's the embarrassment, fact? I mean, it's a big frickin' fraternity. And if you're not a member of the goddamn club, you just can't relate to it. You can't understand it. I don't get it. But 2 AM is said, this is a major story. If we had anybody in this market, their radio was on top of things. But sure, we don't. Since Howard Beagle left from CityLink Magazine. Major story is OJ sickness here at 2 AM. And you know something that is probably just as well and not everybody in town, including all the sponsors are aware of it. Like the people that walked off the course when they saw this murdering son of a bitch on Friday, stormed off the course. WQAN. Yes, sir. George, an mobile on the palm of the bill. Okay, let's go to a mobile on the palm of the bill. Hello. Need a guy. How you doing? I don't know if you're aware of this. But what am I trying to rest in Miami on a prostitution thing in my toadrun? The city of Miami Police Department charges the vehicle $1,000 fine. That's the guy who's involved. Yeah. But the vehicle, I had a fan $1,000. Well, I can't be said they charge the vehicle. You have to pay. Well, you know, whoever owns the vehicle. Yeah. That's $1,000 fine for one. For being involved in the arrest. They had a sting going on as front of a fragrance, Cadillac or whatever. Am I at 20th Street? Oh, I'm back in in 20th. That's my neighborhood. My driver drops the car off there. Four o'clock in the afternoon comes out. He says the gross yell an atom. So he yells at the girl, what are you trying to make $10? She says he asked for me. He goes whatever. You know, driveway, they arrest them for mention of money to the girl. And then he gets arrested. He gets let out on time served in the morning. Yeah. And I go to get my vehicle. I know you are. It says, well, it's $250 for your truck. But you've got to go pay the city of Miami at Dallas. I said, they said there's a fire. And I said, but yeah. And now I had to go to court to try to get the money back. And. And I ended up with 750. Then you drop back. Yeah, I got some 50,000 back. That's not too bad. I said, this is like organized crime. But you imagine how much action you could have got for 250 though. Right. That's what I said. The criminals that put prostitutes are the street. The private, you know, at least they give you something for your money. And additional way, two gives you a blow job for 10 bucks. Right. And that and that's all my dry. Did you see the girl I had all are keeping them out? You should have noticed you wasn't a prostitute. There you go. I said, I said, in Miami there. Raked the money. Okay. Pal, thanks for the good news. Good luck. And I'll take all the money. I might have this bag. I haven't heard it forever. See, I thought, I thought we had them. Sure, I do. We have them. No. Sure, to that. I mean, is it just me or do I mean, I find that, uh, especially nauseating and revolting and very detrimental to this show. That cannot call somebody a douchebag. What is that? Can anybody identify for me what the hell that is when they start with that craft? That's a gate club you moron. Let's be cold. It must be like the mason's, you know? No, seriously. All these clubs, they all have their own little secret hand shakes and secret codes. And all of this other craft. That must be what that is. Because I can't think that like any like real honest to God, people would do that. WCYN. Yes, sir. He just clears around this in the show and, um, I want to see if you might be able to help me out on something. I know you have traveled extensively. Oh, and that's not a one. But I'll get to that. Yes. And, uh, my kid, uh, as a reward for being a great kid and getting good grades and everything, um, he wants to go to Roman or Athens. Yeah, Rome. Rome is the place. Get him around with that. It's filthy. And Athens, the pollution is so bad. You can't breathe the air. It's a disgusting, schmoty place. You don't want to go there. Go to Rome. Really? Trust me. Take it from me, pal. Hey, Neil, that's why I call it. Because I know you cut through all the craft and you're right there. And you're not trying to show me any. Right. You know, that's the thing you travel to. You're trying to do a show yourself. Tell the telly Athens people get lost. Really? I'm telling you. Okay. What's the best way to go there? Is there a particular airline? I'm trying to record. Was a particular airline you would recommend the other time. How are you? How are you? Okay. Have a great time, and you will. Thanks, Neil. I appreciate it very much. Okay, see you. See now there's a guy at least. He didn't do what some of these people. But he reminded me. See now it's all coming back. I just did like a little, uh, mini, uh, spaz out on a thing with a callers. I should have made notes. I could have probably done 16 shows on that. Yeah. I'm going to Vegas. Can you recommend a restaurant? Is there a good McDonald's out there? I'm going to Cleveland. Is there a place I can get some goddamn, uh, white hats? This, this is the input. You get here in South Florida. I mean, if we were on in six, 700 stations, if we were on in 15,000 different markets, can you only begin to will imagine? The difference that it would be. I could whip through six, seven, 18,000 calls a day. No problem at all. To get to calls like we have with that guy, I would be a run and make it on the beach on the, whether it's a fraternity brothers with his bros. I mean, you'd be amazed how many, but you've got to go through a whole lot of people. We just don't have a whole lot of people down here. Just look when you like I've told you before when you're out there on a road. Like right now if you're in your car, just look around. Scary. And it's scary. I don't care if I'm. WCQAM. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Great. Great. All right. Hey, I want to tell you something that took you to, you get a kick out of it. I'm going to go rent this movie called Water Boy, right? And I don't know if you see it, but it's got a part of it. Look for Taylor in it. And he's in a front of this whole, like group of kids, like 12 years old or so. And he's sitting there telling them, you know, how to play football, whatnot. And at the end he gives a single smile and he says, oh, and remember, just say no to drug. I thought, I don't know how to my chair. No, he's so much fun. If you go watch that movie, it's worked at one scene. You gotta go rent it. What's your name in the movie? Water Boy at the Adam Sandler. Oh, God. Oh, God. I felt so out of my chair and the movie's here. I was laughing. I don't think anybody in the field even picked up on because not one person laughed at him was just right after he got, what's the best last time? The last time. The 18th time, right? Oh, my goodness. And don't forget, just say, no, it's OJ too. Yeah, well, and OJ is, he's, you know, because I'm from. But I figure maybe if Pete Rose, you know, goes on to some drugs and maybe the, the let him back into the house. It would be hard to be, especially if he shares. Okay, I knew. And closing, were you put back in? I didn't like that. I was just going to come and ruin the mood. I think I'm going to. All right, I got caught by the, this is my, was a movie, the formerין JUSTIN, I like crying. He is buying. Okay. What a talent! Of my wide-up nii mochro keer buddy. but talking to them on some people need to take a quick powder. I was not talking about like BC powder, you know? Just kind of makes me wonder, you know, just kind of wondering about all these things that I'm seeing. Yeah. I've heard that tournament on Friday with OJ and LT. So I guess if you're like an ex-jack in your name was like, all if you know by only your initials, then you could show up right? Yeah. Kim Polkafer talks sports weekends right here. I'm sports radio 562 AM. I didn't go like my baby. New from the fire and toys. It's the Austin Powers talking down. You'll hear Austin say all of his famous lines from the movie. Kind of. Here's company president Bernie McFarland. We believe the self and disgusting language from this movie is corrupting the young of the country. We have therefore eliminated all the bad ways, but not even a biggest fan of being able to work out. Here listen, I think you're fantastic. They've used very nice skills. Vote for BUNJIT baby. Yeah. Yeah, I can't believe it. The new Austin Powers doll. You are making a concrete save. We do. Available now to see no wish he's parents all in all Spencer gifts. Oh, I'm 43 at 5.60 WCW and by the way that new movie, what the hell's the name of it that I was talking about? See a hockey movie? Would make it the young teenagers including a hockey player? It's called Mystery Alaska. That's from the same people that did Austin Powers. Do you want to be a worse comment from? Make it the young hockey players, by the way. 560, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 on the 18th, T. wireless line. Mike Burrardino, by the way, in the Sun Sentinel, you're a real asshole. Yeah, John Bols is the Marlins have matured this season. Why is it that we got so many people including Surizing or including this guy? Mike Burrardino. Most of the people, that's why I guess Dan LeBancard has to get to your work for at least column of the day today. And I just got in the end about time. You're crazy, you speak. Always have to suck up. Oh, look at how much they've improved and they're competitive. It's a piece of crap, okay? Maybe nobody cares. They stuck it to everybody. They wounded them through the heart. Even those people who did care, they've like Pete on their parade. And he's the shills in his town. Just keep trying to pedal something. And you can all see where they're coming from. So I'll part of the same crap. Just build a sustaining baby and everything will be okay. We'll spend lots of money that it'll be really great. You know what the answer is? No, it was no last week. It's no this week and it'll be no next week. WGQAM. Yeah, it's on Henry. That's the help back. Okay, great. Excellent. Maxo voice pal. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T wireless one. We've cut the burden on the audience down about 70% here today already. And they still can't handle it. Have you noticed that? Look at that. They still can't hack it. WQAM. Hello? Yes. I'd like to talk to Neil please. With this voice? What's wrong with my voice? What's wrong with your voice? Is this your real voice? That this is my real voice. I guess this is what your name? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Listen, what is your lady? Is this a man? Is this a lady? What is this? This is a lady with a bad cold. Okay, sorry. Okay. I'm pretty sorry. Listen. I heard something. I wish it scares me. I've been listening in a Spanish station. Yes. That's on October 9th. They... The situation are planning to paralyze the whole city. On my council. So I call Alex Pinella. Am I called the police department? And they told me, well, they had the right. They have the right to paralyze the city. To protect. To protect. Protect them. I have a lot of you talking about paralyze the city for what? Because some dumb group is coming to play music over here. Oh, because the most vain man thing they're at at the right again. And I said to them, you know, this is my daughter. I mean, though, that's not from the bridge coming home. And she was petrified because she says, everybody around here were angry. And she said that God was on the come out. Now, you hear this radio station guy saying, well, oh, and the honor of the station is the Honest of the Regas. They're going to run from us. So people, you know, will gather together, at least a quarter of a million people. Mm-hmm. And I remember once the same thing happened, and they claimed that they didn't have to pay for that extra police department because he was something, you know, that happened overnight. And then I read in the paper that the game marchers, they have to pay over $2,000 for that police protection. But the thing that gets me, and they said they're going to have to pay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. I'm saying, they're $200,000 gay Cuban marchers. They're going to come on and provide a total of $1,000. And then you have a small down there. But these are people that are opposed to the van bank. Good thing that scares me. They said they're going to come out with a 16-wheelist again. Maybe they're going to parallelize the bridges again. Some guys said, well, maybe we can show some text all over Miami. And I'm not a dumb guy that has a show. So in other words, they're on the air promoting this kind of a... That's right. Just dropping of this community is what you're coming up with. It's a fan of the French radio-edible. And yesterday on the station, there was a young Cuban American people. And they... A young Cuban American people, yeah. And the owner came in, I mean, he said he's going to start running promos for the next two weeks. And I figured, I have, you know, visual removed his license. And you're not a person who can't get a ticket. He has the own two ways. George Rodriguez? Yes. And I said to myself, I'm afraid. My daughter-in-law has to cross the bridge to go to work. She's a nurse. Yeah. What are we going to do about this guy, damn George Rodriguez? Well, he, he, on the station, he shouldn't be running promos to tell people to, you know, to get together, go to the minimum people to protect. And of course, the mayor, his response to this is they got to write to do it. Because actually, he's not going to take a chance to pick up his tickets, which would be. That's his people, yeah. They didn't know anything about it. Mm-hmm. They didn't know nothing about it. They were guiding the police department. And the police relations was to want that to hold me. Well, they had the right to protect. The protect one, daughter, protest. That's the protect. The protect, yeah. The protect. Well, I'd have to go. My daughter's their last from talking too much. Okay. All this and I call you station. And they're putting me in a hole to give you a phone number. And you're going to listen to your station. You're going to listen to some other music. Oh, they were listening to that Power 96, grab. You have a bunch of communist over there, yeah. Okay. How's it going? Thanks, sweetheart. Thanks for the trip. All right. Here we go. See, I told you. I told you, if you go through about 27,000 calls, you finally get the inside the loadout. Here they are starting up again with us. Well, I thought they had this thing solved. I thought that we finally came to an agreement on this guy, damn thing. No, can never come to an agreement because we've got this hysterical element. Let me say it again for the 50 million time, God damn it. This is supposed to be America. And now I don't give a graphic to them from communist Cuba. If they're from China, I don't give a graphic there from a hunger. If they're going to perform here. And somebody wants to bring me. They were just in Toronto, by the way, this weekend, Los Van Van was anybody protesting up there. No. They kind of have a city about it. Oh, they haven't ever skydded crap about it. No. No. Only in the banana republic, baby. Only in Miami. FNA. Mad dog. There's Cuban in Toronto, right? Six. Somebody called said there was some bunch. They keep them jammed in, you know, over there by Chinatown. They got them cordoned off. And by the way, speaking of grotesque things, here is the Rudy Giulia. See, this is what America has become about censorship. censorship. More censorship. I say, screw censorship is what I say. I'm sick of it. Cardinal, a sales painting of Virgin Mary and museum. This is the big to do in New York. Now Rudy Giuliani. He's also the art director now. He was the porno director in Times Square. We made sure they got all that cleaned up real good to make it like Disneyland North. Now the new deal is the Museum of Art and Brooklyn. There haven't a big song to dance. The Brooklyn Museum of Arts knew this play that this show that they got from England. He's never under was breakdown about it because they're all of these different. This is the big story in New York. One of the displays, by the way, one of the pieces of art, I say that in quotes, but nevertheless, art can be whatever any one of the be. Freedom of expression. The picture of Virgin Mary covered with elephant dunk. I saw it by the way, it was lovely. She never looked better. I mean, not covered with it. You got a little here, a little bit there, a little under vacuum, which is, I guess, where you'd expect to find. Cardinal, John O'Connor, a Roman Catholics on Sunday to join him in condemning a painting of the Virgin Mary in Bellusher, the comp of elephant dunk while civil rights activist defended the Brooklyn Museum of Arts right to show the piece. Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who never met a fascist he didn't like. Meanwhile, in fact, that's who we ought to have for Mayor Down here. He fit in perfect. Yeah, get a grease ball, who you know, you fit right in there with those crazy old spicks. Mayor Rudy Giuliani, meanwhile reiterated his pledge to cut all seven million dollars of city funding to the museum, one third of its budget, unless the painting is pulled from an exhibit schedule open this Friday. However, New York's civil liberties union director Norman Seagull said the Mayor's directed up the funding violates the first amendment, his assertion that New York City can withdraw all funds for the museum based on a single exhibition that he finds offensive illustrates a serious misunderstanding of the Constitution. Just like we have here in Miami with all these goddamn right wing old Cubans who don't believe in freedom of expression, who think that they can run as God damn town and keep like I told you before, the whole main county is being held hostage. Has been for years. Seagull who discussed the controversy Sunday as the Speaker of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Harlem, later said by telephone that government funding may not legally be withdrawn because public officials dislike particular works. You don't have an obligation to provide funding to the arts, but once you do, you can't defund the museum solely because public officials are displayed with the expressed in the art he said. The Brooklyn Museum's director Arnold Leeman is not publicly said what he'll do, but he has a reputation for standing firm on matters of artistic expression. Julianne meanwhile defended his funding thread a news conference, and a new member of front park at the West Village. There's nothing in the first amendment that supports horrible and discussing projects, Julianne said, if you're going to use taxpayers dollars, you have to be sensitive to the feelings of the public. One passer by heckled him is eight off Julianne, another shouted, get your hands off our museums. The painting, the whole end by the way, there's a whole bunch of these other displays that we've told you about, you know, pigs and heads in formaldehyde, etc. That's the way it is. They showed it in Britain. They had a bunch of protests there with the most successful art exhibit they've had there in 50 years. You know those brits. The painting, the Holy Virgin Mary, depicts Mary with dark skin, African features, and flowing robes. Also, it was Jewish. She wasn't no sand, flee. It features, and you have to see George likes to refer to, would you use his sand miggers? It features a shellac clump of elephant, dung, and two frozen cutouts of buttocks from pornographic magazines. The artist, Chris Ostele, 30, a black Catholic, was born in England and lived there, said he used the pornographic images because classical images of Mary are often sexually charged, whatever that means. So here's this group of all. This is his thing. It was like Andy Warholman, a soup can with a camel soup can. That was his idea of, okay. People want to pay for that. People want to go to see it. It's their business. Okay. That's what freedom of expression is all about. Not what the mayor thinks is tasteful or inoffensive. Not what the old Cubans here in town thought, I think is appropriate for some performer to be here because their Cubans are not as the case maybe. What is the embarrassment stopping this goddamn town? When to held us some leadership, come forward and say, hey, all you old Cubans, if you want to get back on a banana boat, that's fine. Come on, you're going to bring it with a media note, you and we'll see it at 8 o'clock tonight down at Mickey's shift down there. Okay, the cruise shifts, otherwise dummy up already and get with a program. Or we'll send you back where you came from. We'll take away your visa and your goddamn American Express card. You crazy old farts. But you're not going to get that here. That's why the goddamn pan-aim games are going for ever here. That's why this town is the laughing stock of the goddamn world. Because there are no freedoms in the South Florida. The old Cubans are making sure that in date county and Ken Jenny is making sure that in Howard County. So guess what, eight off? Come on down, baby. You'll have a great time. We'll talk about a double set of standards. We take crap on a year and the FTC wants to find a force. I got a goddamn document from our lawyers that way 600 goddamn pounds that respond to the FTC to want to find a 35 grand for playing stuff for us and crap on a year and taking one. But they can go on a year and promote civil disobedience and tie up the whole goddamn county and nobody dares touch them. Hands off and it's always been that way and always will be. 56050, 560 on the AT&T line. It's 1256 of QAN. New übers are made! Now they're supposed to pay special huge hit? And the powers you protestet! Pictures name new light, replacing us their livesEC capacitoriornexivliusardus You have a brand new style too. We knocked away you fuck your doom.

It's a minute after one at 560 WQA and 560-70560 on the AT&T Wireless One. Yeah, you got to understand that the sex is evil. So if God was going to come to Earth, you'd have to be, you know, if God's son was going to be here, have to be the son of a virgin. Has to be in a macular conception. So it's real clean. There were only about 7,000 religions with a macular conception. With all this other, all these other bubble mice. But thank God we got to write one this time. WQAM. Yes, the growing at next year is WQAM. WQAM? Yes, sir. Yes. What about the gas one, where Friday and OJ? Yes. I just got to make out there. You're the first colleague, man, about that. Nobody seems to care about us. I gotta leave you just, I gotta just leave you with a visualisation and a comment about OJ. And to see if this makes any sense. I see a plain gop on there. And of course, he's got his gop glove on. And that's just a sight. And he's got his gop glove on. And that's just a sight. And he's got his gop glove on. And that's just a sight. And he's got his gop glove on. And that's just a sight. The glove. Yeah. Just being worth it a bloody glove? No, I wasn't bloody. But I'm standing online with him waiting for our Tony Romans. And he turned around. He's talking about Buffalo and how happy the jet fans are to bring his first tattoo He went down. And he says, yeah, you might have me fans through. For death now, he doesn't go bright up on top of the ASC. Because. And then he says, if you guys got really lucky, you got away with one last three, can I have his go in there? No, yeah. So, they wearing a glove and talking about how he was going to do. He was going to get away with two, it's matter of fact. That's just for one. Two for the price of one. Right. It was just as unbelievable. And he did say he's definitely moving two south Florida. Oh, no. The real middle was the real middle buzzing around. I thought he was moving to the Bahamas with the new buzz. Now he's moving to Florida. And apparently he's going to be doing a talk radio show with Lawrence tower in June. Do you know something?

What's very jackass going to do then? Talk about a red face potwacker huh? Those chubby cheekseers are going to be rather than usual. Barry. Because I can't think of anybody else putting them on. Unless you don't think. Where's you got a larger fan base that you've seen in South Florida? He's got four already five. I've seen four or five in the same place before. Sand here. Greg. The water not see. Screw in. And of course. Roy. Five. I bet you're a Marlon game tonight. Don't have that many people going to be listening. How do you like that huh?

They're real. How are you? I'm really pissed off. How come black people in general have an attitude problem? Good question. What do you think about that? That's an excellent question. I don't know. Well, I'm really pissed off because you know, even when I walk into a restaurant or anything like that, they get right in front of you, they cut you, they don't give a crap about us. They cut you? Yeah. They cut you like goji cut his wife up. And that's all I have to say. I want to hear what you say about that. Let's give him a ride up. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, let's get everybody.

Don't choke on the sandwich. That's nothing. Answer. Oh, man. I just got a piece of meat in my throat. Wake down in there too. Man, I really do that. W Q A M. You know, you don't want to know. Who the hell is watching OJ's kids that he made such a big deal about that he wanted custody. When he's out playing golf with his boy. He got to play golf man. That's the important thing. Well, we're going to do the end just and who the hell's watching them. They're on the. They're on the horse court with the judge duty. I think about the. You made his big deal. I want you love to be. Please. We can leave them all three or four days at a time. What kind of father is that? Yeah, it's coming. I think about it. No, well, I'm just saying, you know, the kids, you know, that'll. You took their his motherway, now he's out. He's out. I have to time to probably do some bitch watching them. Right. Anyway, I hope OJ can sit in the head by lightning bolt. Okay. Thanks. Thank you so much. Yeah. W Q A M. I knew. Yes, sir. I am so glad to hear father. So what's coming back? Yeah, listen. I'm a loyal listener to you. He's the only game in a love. And I will not let it in a few of their show. There you go. I call for me to expect. No. 560560. We're all done with the douchebags. Okay. That's a chapter. The sorry chapter in my life that is closed. Okay. It is closed. It is history. It is audio. Let's hear it. Bye bye. No more douchebags. Kind of you and I'll fix me. 9 minutes after one at five. 60. I mean, guys being juvenile. Come on. We're getting more and more of that. 109 of Q A M. We got hangover. Oh, by the way, what I do with that memo, Bob, where Hank's going to be going out again. I thought we were cutting down on those. Yeah. That's what I keep hearing. We're cutting back on those outside deals because we have so many technical problems. And it's embarrassing. And, you know, it's enough to get me all choked up and to be eyed. I'll stretch you with my knife while he calls a lobe. Alright. Then knock your net of their knife while he calls a lobe. Oh! Why is it flowers with you well? But I decided what's up. I would rather slice you with this day. Okay. You're not playing there. But you're calling me. But try to those two. Bitch! I thought it was a mistake. Because you know me. I know you. Oh! We have one, two men, you die. So I decided to love dying. I thought it was a mistake. Just like John, but very rare. Thank you, that old race car. Oh, me. What's it going to be? I got three slips of paper under the door here during the break. I can't say whose names are on them. But all three of the people said that if OJ comes in, they're going out. I do like that. OJ comes on here here on QAM. Everybody's bailing out. So maybe we can have OJ all day. And then while he's out, you know, taking a little stab at life, maybe LTE can like fill the breach. Don't talk about fill again. Fill the breach. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 for a ripster. No time at the OJ and LTE show. How many QAM? The one day is so boring in pop. WQAM. Meal. Yes, sir. You need to tell me that you don't know who at QAM dialed the phone and hoared out the station and the sponsors and invited OJ to that DMG off. Why don't we can you tell me? How would you know? I don't know. But you know, we do. So do listen to show it like you know. How am I going to find out? So it's like to keep the big secret around here. There's nobody that's willing to like, I'm still with guts. Well, do you think that somebody who will be bragging about it with all the fall off that chaplain? Do you think somebody around here is going to be running the house in I done it? There's got to be somebody there who knows and is just dying to leak the damage from agent. Yeah. Well, if they can slip the, just an anonymous note under the door, will you not get away? That's an up on the nation. Even as this whole damn thing took place and you know, if I was a sponsor and the good name is center one, right, drag through, you know, the sweet. Not not to mention all the people on the air here promoted this, having been assured ahead of time, at least I was. And OJ would have absolutely nothing to do with this. Another thing wrong. And also by the way, remember the last couple of days they gave us a promo to read that had the list of, you know, done, struck and this one in that way. And did OJ's name appear on that list? No, did LTA appear on it? No. Another big lie, and maybe all the prostitutes and the horse over there can join LTA and OJ and start their own radio station for all the, whatever, you know what to listen to. Okay. Oh, it's right. Thank you. There's a guy that's pissed off and fired up at the outside. We had somebody that was as outrages as we are. A disgrace. An absolute positive disgrace to the human race. Well, went on here on Friday. And of course, just like today that, uh, goofball, and here was going to be a big song to dance about this very same issue on here. Oh, it's a big joke. Everything, the, the, the big joke. Everything that, you see, you can't worry about your own credibility when you don't have any. That's why we got so many people. They were credibility. What's that? Well, when you start screwing with other people's credibility, that's when we start getting pissed off and fired up. Or however that goes. Pist up in, uh, your nose. How are you doing? Great. Uh, the sworn and I want the election. I was watching the today show and I had a representative and someone from the ACLU talking about this program. Merginary, extramate business. Yeah. Sorry. How are you? The, uh, the ACLU. Pretty much wiped his ass with the Catholic guy. But what the argument the other guy can make him with that. If we can't use government funds to promote any particular religion, how can we be using government funds to Catholic cash as he kept plans? So that was his argument. But I thought you was full of crap. And Katie Kirk, sure we didn't have the ball system up to him on it either. So, um, the other thing I want to let you know is understand it's no worth TV. Yeah. So, yeah. Next to God, you got to understand that. Um, on Friday show and managed was out at the golf tournament. There was great, a great moment that I thought you should Cardo. Um, he's interviewing Don Strock. I think it's like in the first hour of the show and someone comes over and he's messing with him and manage. Like, we're pts him ass and tells him to screw up because he's trying to do a goddamn radio show. Okay. So if you guys could pull that up that would be great. Take it easy Neil. Have a good day. Thanks. I'm pulling it up right now. Okay. Just to flop back down. It's been a little long. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the 18T wireless line. How many people in this audience think that Greg Reed knew ahead of time that he was aware of all this. In fact, maybe even at a hand in raging all these activities. We're just thinking out loud because we're hearing a lot of very sad stories here inside the building. And this is what happens when you can sort with the wrong people. When I got home, I was mad or in hell. I called up Greg Reed from home about this OJ business. Reconda the story just like I posted this morning and reminded him that I had been promised. I had been assured. On my behalf and on behalf of Senator one and everybody involved in this thing that OJ would not be invited would not participate. And his response wasn't, oh my god, you mean to say that he actually showed up out there. It was nothing like that. It was like, oh well, who told you that? Who promised you that? And then after my conversation finished, come to fight out. He came down here to George who was a witness to these meetings that we had with Lewand, Winick and Tracy Long gone, Kira Sato about this golf tournament. And I asked him the same thing. Who promised you that OJ wouldn't be there? As it is difficult to understand why we wouldn't want to be associated with something that he was going to be involved. And also that obnoxious day when Raw came down here in the middle of my show while I was on the year. And then started muttering after chewing the out of my work we promoting this golf tournament, which our promotion guy provided us with no information to promote it with. And then started muttering about how come into on OJ? He was found innocent. I mean, this guy, these people, they live, they breathe, they sleep, they drink OJ, OJ. I mean, I know I need to say OJ was good for you, but too much OJ, I'll tell you anything, you know? That moves with a machete. It's a disease baby. It's an illness here in his building. It has to be carved out. Oops, sorry, not a good term, not a good expression. It has to be sliced out. WQAM. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing, sir? Okay. I'm going to try my best to take off work and go see the show. And I suggest everybody go see the van van show because we got to take this county back from the Cuban dictators. And we need to do this all together. Okay. This is crap, right? See, Neil. Okay, well, you have a good time. Okay, I'll be in Brower that night myself. I'm not sure when it is, but I'll be in Brower. I just figured it out. I think I'm out of town that weekend. WQAM. Is this Neil? Yes, sir. I know. One question. This Roy, Roy Foster, have anything to do with you? Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Roy, Foster, have anything to do with this? Foster, who is it? No, Roy Foster. Did the anything do with one? With OJ coming here. I would say that if I were to start building a list of suspects that Roy's name that Roy would be very close to the top of the list. He would be in my top two candidates of suspects. And I've lost all respect for that gentleman. Yeah. He should be a good dolphin, but he's a gentleman. He and OJ. In other words, if association with OJ is what you're quite Tyrion is going to be for judging him, then I forget it because the two of them are tight. Hi. Wow. This is the man that was trying to get OJ on the year on this radio station. What is he doing? What is he thinking? I think you were really pushing now when you used the word thinking. Yes. Have a good night, don't say. Don't squeeze a juice. Okay. Was he using Roy and thinking in the same sentence? Is that what he was saying? Uh-huh. Again, we're just thinking out loud here. I have no evidence. You know, we have no evidence. We got to bring in Columbole and we got to get Miss Agatha Christie, whatever her name was. Miss Marble. In fact, he just took Miss Marble's thing and Columbole, Columbole, was I used to be. WDQAM. How well new? Yes, sir. I want to do today. Great. You're doing screenless, huh? I'm doing whatever I can. Trying to mix it up a little here today. Hey, nailabud is on the work character. I had a guy turns out a million dollars. Yeah. And any clients for like three quarters less than that. Right. And now he's committing suicide. Because he couldn't pay his child support. That's unbelievable. How do you like that? How stupid can people be? I'm going to put a chapter in about him and my book called Sparks is Making Babies. I thought it was going to be very interesting. Okay. Have a great day. And of course, to do it there in Lansing to that, I take great Umbridge with that, you know, especially after the Spartans be Illinois there. And I've gone air Michigan State. I'm Billy Burr. Who don't look as good as all. Poor Tommy Brady saw some of that Michigan game. I hope mad dogs listening to that. They probably not. When Tommy Brady got hit like a god damn ham sandwich under a counter. Wow. Hadland bounce it off the turf there. And Wisconsin. Little concussion, baby. Don't mess with our boy Tommy Brady, baby. I set the arrow with my head in my hands while I was watching that. In fact, before I was watching that, because Tommy Brady was on, I already had my head in my hand. He's a very handsome young man. That is can't see that. Exactly. WKOM. WKOM. WKOM. WKOM. WKOM. I'm George. Yes sir. What's up man? I worry about you. Okay. Could I speak to Neil? Where you calling from? Okay. Let's go to Pemberg Pines. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. Are you doing? Okay. Neil. What are your comments about the metriot? Oh, and if I think is what he said. They say, it's something under his breath. Oh, F. I just dropped your sand and then what are my comments about it? The metriot is under what? Huh? What are my comments? How is this for a comment about somebody that slashes himself in the net? Eeeeh. Why is anybody talking only about him? And the fact not the fact that Jimmy we could be special Johnson is the one that tried his ass up. As an all hey we've got nothing to lose you know. Nothing to lose except maybe our software is spec. Kind of like here at Q.I.M. How can you lose your software is spec when you don't have any? Don't forget by the way, Hank won't be on today. We got the O.J.L.T. show it to the staff to know. Hank don't know it yet. You're going to have to who's going to break it to him. You think Jason Josh? Well, I mean, we're nearly the program director. We tell you guys I'm like that, but he gets to emotional you know. O.J.L.T. to the sex. Oh, take that piece. What are you Jackass? Yeah, I think we're going to have a big guest though. You're going to put in our person to celebrate today. You're not overhaulers new programming here in the market. Not are all this good stuff going on. Are you sure positive man? Succeeding time to be alive here in South Florida. Wake up. What's the first piece? Joe Rogan. The forest is the Goldstein. We're in Horingson 6. Only on fourth video, 5.69 a.m. That'll do the fucking more. Listen to me, it's a stand-bying being for South Peking and a stand where everything is out to the high, so-peking standards. The selection isn't just huge, it's so-peking huge. Believe me, you'll never shop anywhere else. And so-peking surprises aren't just low, they're so-peking low. You'll never find them anywhere else. Listen to me. When I take South Peking as a beautiful store, I mean, so-peking beautiful. Dave's driving helpful. I mean, so-peking helpful. Listen to me. Get to know the so-peking and enjoy a selection that's so-peking huge. A stand-by at so-peking courtyous and pricey status, so-peking low. You'll never shop anywhere else. But don't take it for me. Take it from satisfied, custom-up, frank, and stine. So-peking gold. Yo, set up franky, so-peking good. I don't want to be a program, dude. I'm sorry. It's the 131. I just keep- I just keep- Kind of bring up the image of Friday. It all-you-duck. It was very emotional time here at about 131. It's OJ's Theroy Brod. Get off you duck. And there were a lot of people getting very hysterical, very high-strung people, you know, squirting a few here and there. 5, 6, 7, oh. Oh, 5, 60 and 5, 5, 60 on the AT&T Wireless Line. A little bit of a new twist here today. A little more in the old little less of somebody's callers. And you know, it's already making a little bit of progress. But there's almost no building a day, you know? Wasn't building a day. Takes a little bit of time. You'll see. It'll be a perfect fit. W-w-a-n. Hello? Yes. Yeah, I went to play something from you. Okay. Where you from? Where am I calling from? On each. Okay, here's your call from Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, I got something to play for you. Okay. Okay. Okay. All set. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. We got this. Thank you. I'm a public here. Oh, okay. Thanks, we're done. We got it from Bell Butter Quality. But thanks for the effort. It was bizarre. It was okay. And the yellow scale is zero. It was like a minus. Oh. There's no letter to my ear. But the intentions were good. She had an all-q got there and you peed under parade. God dammit. We're going to find out. We're going to get to the bottom of this whole thing. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised with all the connections we got with a limo drivers out there. That's the way to go about this. We'll find out from the limo driver who peed for OG and LT to go to that God dammit. Logo moron. I'm not Friday. That would be a good way to approach this thing, huh? Would that be the ultimate embarrassment? We got people around here waiting to get their bonuses. People who wait and wait and wait months to get paid. Wouldn't that be something if a place is always crying, poor mouth? A place that makes the employees buy their own station trinkets, t-shirts and the crap. I can't believe in a million years. So long as you're just kidding. Sure I can. WQAN. Neil? Yes sir. How are you doing? OK. If OG moves here, which is inevitable, I think people ought to do what we, my family did. We're all moving out. That's right. We're all going to leave it to him. Well, better than that. When we went to LA a few years ago, I found his house and rocking him as my wife and daughter. He didn't go ahead in the car. I turned up the cassette player full blast. I played one of your old tapes to watch. And I was outside there and I made quite a promotion there. Great. And I've always started somebody didn't bring a boom box to the golf course. That's what people need to do. I hope this guy was wrong because I read over the weekend and one of the tabloids, which I always read on a plane to kill a lot of good time. I was reading that, uh, it looks like he's moving to the Bahamas or somewhere now. Which believed me if there was ever a match made in heaven. Yeah, I'm on. That's it. The house pitiful as they are. Yeah. You weren't mentioned. We were mentioning a classic call. Do you had over the years? I have it on tape. Do you remember the guy who once called you? I have to do with the big important story that they was the, the stamp, whether it should be the younger the old, fat Elvis. And his guy was dead serious. Oh, yeah. The anesthesia stamp. Yeah, we had that. Oh, that's a classic. Yeah. All right. Last but not least. Yes, sir. As, um, my daughter got shy. That called you a few months ago how you would talk about the radio stations here buying the audience. Right. My daughter entered this contest with Y100 and at the end after she had won and did jump through all their loops. They found out, oh, you're not 21. Uh, well, you can't have the prize. We'll send you to the house. Well, who the house? Y100 is 21 anyway. They got nobody listening over the age of 19. Well, they shine today, so because they didn't tell or originally when the contest ran, but you had it the over 21, the wind is free ticket. Tony contest. Oh, I 100 again. They want to gotten big trouble over that years ago. Well, it's three months since I left Coral, Jordan. I think I'll tell you now. She's still waiting for the stink and freaking movie tickets. How do you like that? Have a good day. Thanks. It's a killer, you know. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Yeah. Hi. How you doing? I'm doing okay. Well, you know, so I wanted to talk a little bit about this paternity business that you mentioned. And I just wanted to ask, if you have any best friends and hollows. If you have those best friends or what does that mean? Well, it means what does that have to do with this? It has to do with everybody's best friends. I mean, if they have any time, it all sure. It has to do with the paternity. And not necessarily taking showers or all the other hazing and whatnot that goes on. But it has to do with hanging out with a bunch of guys. Hi. I have two best friends. One is straight. One is gay. I've never had sex with either one of them. I've never seen either one of them naked or have any desire to do either one of the above. Okay. What take showers with them? Don't step the towels at them. All right. In the paternity now, we don't socialize by people in showers together. It's a guy who takes a shower. And the other guy's got to go to class. He goes into showers. Well, it's not a question of socializing in the shower. I'm not talking about socializing in the shower fraternity. We're talking about hazing and initiation of fraternity and group sex. I'll tell you about hazing and initiation. When you are, when you're in the age of adolescent, 18, 19, and you're trying to find yourself in college. Whatever it may college may be, fraternity is lend itself. It's putting a bunch of guys that are like you. What I see like you, I mean, they like the same interest. They play the same sports. They are group of guys together that automatically, for some reason, I can't explain why, become your good friends for life. Now, when you have a good friend, then like I mentioned to you, when you have a best friend or someone who's a good friend of yours, you share experiences with them. And part of becoming a good friend. I mean, second one experiences. Oh, well, it could be, it could be two guys on a girl. It could be two girls on a two guys. It could be, you know, in the bathroom, four guys taking showers with four girls. The experience of sexual or not sexual is irrelevant. No, no, it's not irrelevant at all. Of course, it is not. When you're in the fraternity, your your goals are to make friends. Because you have a friend. Sir, because you have a best friend or a bunch of good friends, doesn't mean a that you take showers with them because you're going to be friends for a long time. And be certainly doesn't mean that you share a sexual experiences with them. We're going to ask you a group second. You can see, you know, some of the, I belong to a health club. And in the health club that I want to do is it's a completely heterosexual health club. Yeah. But the shower is the shower with, with six falls on it. Now, do you think that I've become part of that health club so that I can work out with guys and then go take showers? I have no idea. You can answer that question. I don't know. That's not there. Although I will. I will. I will. That's what you guys will do, but that's beside the point. Me, personally, I do not that a bastion of homosexual activity in health clubs. I do not go and join the fraternity. Don't sound so defensively, believe you. Yeah. Point of attorney and communal showers and group sex. And whatnot, is that a question? What is the point of the point of the fraternity? I'm hazing and the point of becoming a little bit more important. What is the point of making another, what is the point of making a young kid getting a little bit more important? I'll give you a straight forward hand. Please, let's bring along when you belong to a fraternity. And I'll say it again. You belong to a bunch of guys that are going to be your friends for life. And part of the one way that everybody is getting made for you. Let me finish part of the experience of having a best friend, whether it may be a best friend that you play soccer with or may it whether it may be a best friend that you are drinking with. Yeah. You share intimate moments. Not that sentiment moments. Not that sexual. When I think intimate, I don't mean sexual. I mean intimate in the sense that you will not share that kind of experience with anybody else who is not your friend. For example, you have something that sounds so faggy to me that even I'm embarrassed for you sir. You want to know something very faggy to me. Running through the beach naked with a bunch of guys. You're never going to share experience with anybody else. Not even your wife or your kids or any other friends that you have. Why would you run around and why would you run around and the bunch naked with a bunch of guys? Why do you want to do that? I'm not using that question if you want. You don't have a choice. Right. Why do you want to force these kids to be naked? Why do they always have to take their clothes off? My, my closet friend. I don't every day. And hang it out of the showers of the gym. Why don't you tell me the real story here, pal? I don't every day experience. People do not in a fraternity walk around naked. No, do they speak in your ears? No, stop. You can't stop when I talk to you. Stop with a theme in the steam bath. Okay. Let's get back to the meat of the matter. Tell me why you want to see to make these guys get naked. What is that all about? It's a matter of respect. It's a matter of respect. No, it's a matter of lack of respect. For a thing by you. It's a matter of lack of respect. If I respect somebody, I'm not going to force them to the grade themselves and embarrass and humiliate themselves in order to be part of my gang law. But if you're going to be part of a particular group of friends and guys. Who says that? I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to cut it out. Okay. Without any more discussion, it's very simple. A child could tell you if somebody demands that I get naked in order to be their friend out past. Okay. There's a good message for all you kids out there. If any other male, your age, older, whatever age, if they demand that you take your clothes off and engage in some kind of naked, hanky, panky in order to be a part of their club in order to be their buddy in order to be their pal, run like a bandit. Run like a son of a bitch. That's the best call I've ever had in my life. Hey, man. See, now I understand the thing about Rimmer thinking he was my best friend because the last time when he was over the house a couple weeks ago to bring me the panted tickets. He was asking if I wanted to take a shower. This is 560. You were here. Oh, man. It's every minute. It's that type of thing. Because, you know, it's a lot of time. I think about folks, you know, in a lot of the number of things. I don't know food, I don't know the meat. I tell him, I don't know crazy. I'm just saying, I'm eating it all. I didn't do that. I'm not eating that. I just didn't do that. I was just talking about, I'm just saying, I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I'm not eating that. I said, here's Bokeh. I wonder if you're aware of the growing scandal of going on here in Bokeh. What is that? The Italians are trying to muscle into the Jewish Daly business. Very upset about it. There's a growing luck. Well, the thing you know, the Jews will be trying to muscle in the pizza business like a pizza lot. There's a growing war out here in the old beginning between, um, oh, okay. Thanks. Thanks for the exciting news. WQAM. WQAM. Hi. Yes, sir. I like speaking Neil. We're going from four loader. Okay. Here's more loader. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. I listen. One of the few happened to see yesterday's local section for loader. People were, uh, Ken Jenner's staying in front of the picture. Uh, the map of Brad County. How are you planning on taking over every place? Yeah. He's planning on moving into. He can run. There. Yeah. I don't know if he started going on with us that. All right. Yeah. He wants to get that. He's working on. Okay. Thanks for the good news. You're all checking out. Yeah. Ken Jenner in, uh, Brower in the course day. We don't need a Ken Jenner in day because you got all the old Tubans or at Domino Park with their Spanish radio language stations going. I don't know. Twenty four hours a day urging civil justice disobedience and causing enormous strife and chaos everywhere they can here in South Florida. Unbelievable. Six, seven, five, sixty pound five, sixty on the AT&T wireless line. WQAM. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm calling a speaker Neil. Where you calling from? Princeton. Princeton, New Jersey. No, Princeton, Florida. Okay. Okay. Here's a call in Princeton. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Okay. This thing with the O.J. Yes. It was on the channel 10 the other night. And, um, some guy named Sam. I can't think of this last name from W2A. Sam Dushman. Sam Dushman. Sam Dushman. He clearly indicated that W2AM had sponsored this thing with O.J. That's right. They invited him and they provided all the services for him. So if you want to know who paid for his limo, that's the guy's name. Well, what did you say now? I find that just astonishing to what, what words did he say? I mean, it's best you can remember. Well, if that's not to remember Neil, he was interviewed and he can do. Yeah, Sam. He was on channel 10. And you know how to media can put stories together. And they show W2AM and then they show Jim Mad Dog, Managed and then they showed O.J. And he made it seem like what a managed chapter there was. No. The managed didn't say anything, but the media made it seem like he was in the right. He did sland by the managed. Right. Managed was all in with this. Right. And then afterwards they said, and Sam, he said, oh, well, we're very proud to have O.J. And he's a celebrity. And this is a celebrity golf tournament. And that's the reason we invited him. And that's the reason we provided the services for him to get there. I'm so full of this. There is no doubt, Neil, that this guy and Greg Reed and his whole bunch of crony, they did this. No doubt about it. It was all channel 10. I mean, this guy was clearly, I mean, he was gloating. He was gloating that we had O.J. in this tournament. And the lady, it was all planned. They didn't want to mention it to you because they know you were going to rip him in ass. If they had. So they just kept it under under the bar. This was in violation of an agreement that we had to do this thing in the first place. Well, I don't know why the center one people didn't want to be associated with O.J. I didn't want to be associated with O.J. I'm sure that nobody else on his radio station. I can't speak from, but I have my feelings. I know, my hand is made a real clear today. But you know, but he also on his station wants to be affiliated with O.J. Oh, yeah. Well, we're managed. So he came on the radio. Just an end. We're there. He wasn't going to have any axe murderers.
