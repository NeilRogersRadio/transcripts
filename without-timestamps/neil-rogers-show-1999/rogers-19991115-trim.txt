4 3-0 5 6-PW 2 AM Miami 4-Liter Delperous that's the Neil Rossier Show. This is a talk to Neil called 5 6 7 0 5 6-P-Toll Free for David Broward, or Pound 5 6-Theon yourself Oh, the opinions of Neil his guests, callers or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WCQAMB's read-in positions or the review broadcast booth. Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 5 6-P-Q-A-L. Okay, it's in broad! Oh, right. What's reading is you badly? I know that was born like a thuss in the ocean, strong means would not. They're not found out the show. So me, can I hear? Please say, hey, over. Which it can be, uh, too. Oh, okay. What's your blow, please? Just one bit, please. You can show me, because I do. Give your blow me. There just one bit, please. Oh, me. What's your blow me? Just one bit, please. Oh, me. Just one bit, please. Oh, that's about 50 WCQAM happy Monday, too. Yep. And I'm going to tell you those sports holes are so pretty. I'm just loving it. I'm squeezing myself. I'm so excited. First, the Huraculans get their answers. Want by Virgin Tech. Let's hear it. All right, nice, God boy. And then Jimmy, we got to stop the special. Get this ass kicked up there in Buffalo, big time yesterday. And he's blaming the media and too much attention on this. And they're calling, oh, we want Danny back. Well, now we like Danny. You're so predictable. It's just embarrassing. Don't you have any shame? No, any sense of embarrassment, humiliation. No, degradation. Too face-ness? No, anything. No. But anyway, that's the way it goes. They got their answers. Kicked and that's, you know, that's sports baby. You win some, you lose some, and some get rained out. Nothing good will come from overpopulation. Here's another great letter. By the way, thanks to our friends at Legal Seafood for a nice breakfast this morning. Nothing like a real good shrimp cocktail on some clam chatter for breakfast. What's wrong with that? How many years have I been telling you people? You don't have to have God damn cereal and eggs for breakfast. What were the never-come from? Did God write it in the Bible? You supposed to eat certain things for breakfast? No, what's wrong with shrimp cocktail and clam chatter? For breakfast, from Legal Seafood. Thank you guys. That was great. Great letter to the editor today. In a sunset, by the way, every day pretty much you can find one that stands out either because it's so good or generally because it's so bad. Today's being very good from Chuck Irvine and sunrise. Nice going, Chuck. Oh, God. I got a Jewish boy to me. Who says nothing good will ever call or Chuck. No, any Jewish guys named Chuck Irvine sounds, you know. Not really. Irvine sounds like those horse people from all Ohio down Irvine Jr. and senior red. Oh, those guys. Like I said, nice go, your boy. Well, seriously, just come up with one Jewish guy named Chuck. Are there Jewish charleses? Don't start trying to see George's back and right off the bed. He's starting to twist things around. Chuck. Like Chuck Mire. Now, see Chuck Mire sounds, do you know that he do I? No, no, but that sounded like it. Yeah, he was hit a little mustache. Now he was all right. Chuck, I'm trying to think, do I? Have I ever met one Jewish guy in the world? How about Chuck's Inc? Is he Jewish? No, no. Chuck, uh, ground Chuck, Chuck roast, Chuck roast, Chuck Schwartz. Well, somebody, they're my mentioned. There's a Jewish Chuck. Somebody in the audience knows a Jew named Chuck, but anyway. Nothing good will ever come from overpopulations. The heading and it says on October 12, the United Nations announced the birth of the six billions of people. There's billions of people on his planet Earth. This is definitely no time for jubilation. No. No. No. Overpopulation is a director of the human beings just 50 years ago, scientists announced that this planet couldn't support three billion people. So, officially, we couldn't feed them. Give them jobs, proper, proper medical treatment. Now we're faced with six billion people. God damn it. Americans have not yet experienced a full impact of overpopulation. However, China for many years has been a boarding millions of newborns and families are allowed only one daughter. India's got millions of homeless people begging for food in the streets. Bangladesh has got millions of children dying of starvation and disease. Wherever overpopulation exists, people lose their sense of dignity in the moral code and lower themselves to animals, says Chuck. Nothing good will come from overpopulation. Only famine and perhaps war will be the outcome for future inhabitants. There you go. Makes a lot of sense to me. If anybody with a brain, stop making so goddamn many babies. First, sterilization. You can screw your brains out. Then we don't have to worry about your reproducing. Screw your brains out. Have a good time. Just stop reproducing. Because things like birth control and plant hair and all those, that's a little bit too complicated. We don't have time to wait for dumb people to be taught those things. And the way for the right wingers to let us teach them those things. So just sterilize all these barbaric people. Okay, please. What we do it today sounds good. There's probably a little known fact from the dolphin business in Buffalo yesterday, but if you scoured the columns, there's always something in their worthwhile that most people don't know them, but also don't care about. The back street boys were in Buffalo for weekend concerts and along with the countless teenage girls that stalked their hotel, they had one more unlikely fan. Dolphins guard Kevin Donnelly. Oh, look a pad and pen and try to get members of the band to sign autographs part of the yesterday's game. But he was rebuffed by security that surrounded the band, which was at the stadium to sing with National Anthem. While it's uncertain whether Donnelly wanted to get autographs for himself and is possible, he wanted the signatures for his three-year-old daughter, Kayla. See, that's always the way these guys do it. Just like John Pena said, I was the department. Pretends that it's his daughter that's obsessed with 98 degrees. He knows the lyrics of every song. Oh, yeah, come to me at the end of the day. Oh, do you get the Christmas album yet? You got that yet? He can give you the name of every song. The lyrics he can sing along? Yeah. Even those nicknames have such huge size from 98 degrees. But no, that's his daughter. That's a big fan. And so the same with Kevin Donnelly. So if he's out with a Humper this week, by the way, it's kind of embarrassing because it was watching Hank on ESP yesterday. And when they threw it to him, they were talking about the back sweep boards that did the same national anthem. Yeah, that's what they said in Hank on a wet. Like that. Like, what is he supposed to say? You know? They get a trail by the way. This right on the heels of us talking about this last week in a sudden, Sentinel. This was the over weekend Saturday's paper yesterday. Did you hear about this about how they had a fingerprint all the priest in the employees of the art sizes of mind in last Friday? Yeah, they took their fingerprints. I said they should have took their tongue prints and their lip prints would have been a lot better. I'm sure if the animal-think fingerprints show up on your fucking Oswald voice penises. So they should have been taken like tongue prints and the lip prints from the lips. Gum prints. Yeah, that's what a priest says. I'm gumming. I'm gumming. When they call it me, I'm gumming. Eventually, I'll get there. Fingerprinting can protect kids. How do you like that? Here's a sad and shocking sign of the times. It says, soft lotus, catalyct, priest, nuns, seminary students. Is that seminal? Lay workers and church volunteers of being fingerprinted to see if any have been arrested or convicted of serious crimes, including child abuse. It goes down about how troubling this is. 3,800 employees and 700 volunteers are working with children. The elderly disabled workers. They had to be fingerprinted. It says while troubling, it's also logical to wise and necessary for the church to take this extraordinary step across America and around the world. The church has been played with cases of certain priests, of certain priests, certain priests that said involved in sexual abuse of adults and children. People fact in the church. Right. As a consequence, the church has faced embarrassing publicity. A loss of insurance and multibillion dollars of damage lawsuits from victims in their families. So now they've got a fingerprinting. Like, where is Jack Webb? Where are you? Yeah. Like that. It's a criminal organization. We have to go in there and figure put him and I guarantee yesterday morning and all day yesterday, a lot of you people are out there subsidizing this corrupt institution, which by the way, they're very upset about dogma now. About this new movie. I'm not just somebody in the audience. We haven't seen this already. Dogma. I don't know what they're upset about. They've been 85 million movies out. They're skating movies. The excesses, all the godfather movies priest. Nancy Habits. They've been 50, like I said, 20 million movies. Rip into Catholic Church and rightfully so. And they're upset again. And the filmmaker who's they develop Catholic, by the way, Kevin Smith, he says, what's it all about? I'm just trying to make some money. They have no sense of humor. They have no sense of humor. See, you're paranoid like that because you know it's true. You know what's all true? That's why you're reacting to lash out. Like some asshole they hit on their own CNN last night. Just lashing out. This is this. This is disgusting. Just like this program, right? Tell an accepted candidate, 560 WQM. No portion of this broadcast may be reproduced without the express written permission of WQAM-BVRI's acquisition court. As a crime. While spending the remainder of your golden years in the land of death, the one thing you have to defend on is your car. With two canoe theft on the rise, the people who brought you a big black guy named Ben Carolar. Now, bring you and old Jewish guy named Isaac. Get away from my portable bill. You think MF? Remember when we used to boost the second carabine. We ought to get a bundle of the day's baby. The white one's a cooler. Get away from my portable bill. You think MF. What the hell is that? I have sex seriously. So fat is he like that. I think somebody else. Get away from my portable bill. You think MF. Get away from my portable bill. You think MF. Whenever some fast tries to steal my car, I feel safer. With an old Jewish guy named Isaac. Get away from my portable bill. You think MF. Get your old Jewish guy named Isaac Carolar now. And receive a free flower antenna. Get away, get away, get away from my portable bill. You think MF. And old Jewish guy named Isaac Carolar. I will be able with all of those stories. 15 to 560 WQM. So Saturday, it's specs we had. I wouldn't say a mob scene because it's not the kind of a place. And by the way, thanks again to our friends. It's specs to do a great job for us. They're tremendous. We didn't have a mob scene because it's like a, you know, it's a standalone story. And they have like a limited amount of parking. And it's in the Gables there right across from U.M. And we had, you know, a steady, a flow of people. And it must have been too bad because we raised 335 bucks there on Saturday. I just got the numbers here from Carol. That's pretty good. Had a lot of very fine of people are on Saturday. Like I said, and we really did. We had a lot of living and breathing people are, which is great. But the point is I'm looking at my total now, 48,632. And it's the 15 that's the midpoint in November. All I can say is, oh, I mean, between the, you know, the start with a CD's being screwed up in the beginning. We lost the two thirds of the month of October. And then we had that famous golf term. Yeah. That famous. Ehh. Golf term. But I will say this the big hit so far along with the CD's. By the way, those T-shirts are disaster. They shouldn't have had the Pope, the media, the picture me doing the Pope on a T-shirt. See, that's what I wanted. Do I, does it make any difference what I want? No, I'm just small potatoes. I didn't think we were going to have any. Yeah, but we shouldn't have had them with the picture with the Pope on everybody loves that. Spock on over biggest by far and, you know, a couple of people have said to me, when you know, 20 bucks for those key chains because it's not just the key chain. The tattoo is like a little too bite too, uh, box. That's his new Rogers Center one. Doesn't say QAM on it by the way. Oh, thank God. And if they deserve any publicity. Oh, God. But anyway, they, you know, have a little. The sound and if you hold them down. They repeat. And, uh, the kids, especially the ones like 30 and 40 years old are having a great time. Oh, seriously, they're getting like red in the face with these things. A little kid, especially, but yeah, like about 50 and 60, those kids. So a very interesting thing happened along with the fine interesting looking people that showed up there on Saturday at specs. Our old friend Adam showed up. The former producer of the Rick and Sudshow, my close personal friend Adam, who's a good guy. We like Adam, even though he's a little bit, you know, groupish. Well, I'll remember that old website. Oh, yeah, we remember those days, but nevertheless, so Adam shows up with his, not girlfriend, his fiance. Okay, we seem like a nice lady. Seeing like. And we're talking these tell me how clear channel is the worst and about how Rick went through this whole thing. Are you leaving because of me? Was it me? Just like the Marvin thing. Every time the producer quits on that show, Rick goes through this long side contact thing is because of me. And of course, the everybody knows the answer is yes. What was it? Yes. Yeah, because you Rick, because you're impossible to work with because you're just paying in the ass. Because it seems to me that there are people in this business, always blame their failures or whatever it is. And they're producing. So he's somebody else's called the dog done at you know, if I John Bonay, the dog done it. Somebody else did it like with OJ. And to same thing over to your queer channel. But anyway, so Adam's there with his fiance and we're talking about this talking about that. He's wandering around. He loves the CDs with the cover there. Me with the pope thing on all of a sudden out of nowhere. He says, as they're standing off to my left. I don't know if the audience is ready for this. I know why sure wasn't. So whatever her name was, I apologize. I forget what her name was. Now you're long to stay in my I'm forgetting. He says my friend here. I don't have time to care lady. Yeah. Oh, from two weeks ago, was that you were still here that was before you went away. Yeah, from a couple of weeks ago, when we had all the shootings, we're talking about all these kids getting killed and kids killing other kids. And all these horrible things. And this woman calls in on his show and goes through a big song to dance about being indifferent. And then she says, I don't have time to care. Not only don't I care, but I don't have time to care. I guess she's busy taking care of Adam. A lot or whatever whatever they're doing. So she don't have time to care. They left shortly after that, by the way. That was kind of like a conversation stopper. You know, I'm saying kind of like there was a dark Paul over the entire proceeding at that point for a few seconds until they kind of like wandered away. She's the, I don't have time to care. I guess I don't know. You've got to be joking. You are joking. She said no. That's me. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Our first call of a new week. After waiting 18 minutes and 18 seconds, I reach over. I put my finger on it. I say, here's Miami. And there's nobody there. Here's a mobile in the keys. Hello. Good morning. Yes, sir. You know, you're good. Thanks. I get to get off to our various case. Now that he scored a golden plate. So, well, who's on his case? I know. Who's on his case? Who's on his case? What is that Sunday going back to the ice cap? Who's on his case? You are. No, I'm not. I mistake. I certainly said what you were on Friday. I said the people were getting very sick and tired of having him not playing. And we wanted to see him play. And he played in the escort of beautiful goal. And we were very excited. That was great. That's pretty fine. Yeah. I mean, you're special Saturday news. Great meeting you. Yeah. On nice day. Okay. There's another guy with no material. I wonder which one he was. He certainly wasn't one of the final looking young people. I was telling you, I'm sorry. Not that George Carey, but nevertheless, I'm self-assured. So I tell everybody about these things. Yeah, there were a lot of really you find people there for me. 560, 50, 50, 50. We're looking for Jews named Chuck. Are we going to find any? No. By the way, the Panthers got raised here for a specific fan of mine. By the way, so we're glad to have him back from a selfish standpoint. We're happy about that. But, you know, it's he really what we're looking for. Oh, I don't think so. She's got him stealing Sullivan. I'll tell you that right now. But he's too small. They don't like to small guys in this organization. We know that. Here's for a lottery. Hello. You know, how you doing? Great. You guys watching the, okay, we got this Chicago Minnesota game yesterday. And the announcers said after, they've been saying this for a couple of weeks now. That when the Minnesota area, the kicker for Minnesota miss the fuel load of Women's Game, water, Peyton must have had a hand on the ball. Uh-huh. And then, and then, and then, and then, maybe, maybe his liver was on the ball. Yeah, but then, but then, but then, okay, then the Bears get the ball back. And over time, they have a chance to put it. But their kicker misses it. So what happened to water, Peyton there. And then, we have a dead man can only, we didn't involve so much. You know, I don't want to kind of peed it out by the time overtime came. And then, it's not against the ball back. And of course, uh, Anderson hits the, hits the fuel go to win the game. So what happened there? He, like I said, he went and doubt he peered out. I think he's announcers talking like this. I just, I think it's ridiculous. But, but it, but that's the way Americans talk. That's the way this, this phony thing. Oh, he's looking down on us now. I'm sure he's watching now. You know, when somebody croaks them in a box in the ground, they're not up in a sky somewhere. Looking down. No, but the thing is no one knows who knows. Maybe he is. Maybe he isn't the wife and say it. You don't even know anybody knows. What happened? If there's a guy, if something, if you go to the sky, if you go to the sky, if you go up to the sky. If you're in the ground, let me ask you something. Have you ever been in a plane? Yes. Okay. Now, when you're up at a plane, like 33,000 feet up in a year. Right. Well, you, that's that point. You realize you look down and you see the earth and you realize and you look up. There, there's no such thing as up. Don't you understand? There's no up in the sky. There's no up. There's no down. It's just space. What does that mean? Up in the sky. It's just a little bit of a bit of a golden baton. He's blocking the field goal. All right. Who knows what happens to you? Maybe go to heaven, maybe you don't, maybe we just start. Don't know. Let me stand again. You go into a box in the ground. We know. Okay. We know. You know. Really? We don't. Okay. Have a great day. You're saying it for the 10th time. But you're, you're being evasive because you don't want to face the fact. See, I realize it's not a pleasant thing. But if we can't even agree on that, if you can't accept that, what's the point of talking about anything? You don't want to say it? Exactly. Yeah. I mean, if we can't even agree on something as basic as that, you're living your life. You're dying. You're going to box. They stick in the ground. Everybody cries a lot. Then they go eat. And then they go on it because life is for the living. That's what it is. You don't go up in the sky. I love when they say that. Heaven. Oh, that's up there. And hell. That's down there. That's. Oh. It's down there. And you're going to be there, Neil. Oh, I can't wait. No, I'm not going to be down here. I'm already there. I'm already in hell. Believe me. George discovered that when he came back to work today. Oh, my God. North Carolina wasn't so bad. I'm in hell. I'm back here. Oh, yeah. But they're getting the job done out here. We got some fresh paint on the walls out here. They're getting ready to put the new carpeting down out there. They're getting ready to put the ceiling tile up. I guarantee you some time in the next millennium will get this guy named project. I won. I won. Wanna be easily greeds. I'm going, boys. What a bunch of clowns, man. Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap. If you pay the goddamn contract, oh, by the way, do you know how long it took to build? Where did I see this? Oh, it was Mike Wallace. It was on the Inusia tonight. The Empire State Building. You know how long it took to build it? 13 months. 13 months. Here we are on the third floor in some thickie three floor office building. In by the by the date growered line in the Adamsville, in the middle of nowhere. And it's taking them years to get this done. They built the Empire State Building in 13 months, Greg. And we got, we got some paint on the wall out here. That's there, Teddy. We're doing it. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Have you seen dogly yet? No, I have not. That's what I was asking. Right. I'm going to be seeing it this weekend. But I thought it's very funny is that the people who have been protesting and tofu and drawing. Having seen it. Having seen it. Having seen it. Right. There was an interview on Friday. I wanted the new station with a woman from Catholics in the media who reviews these things from whatever a Catholic perspective is. And she said she was not offended at all. Yeah. She thought it was the movie was arrived. There you go. It's a comedy for Christ's sake. It's a satire. People just take things too seriously. And that statement is in it. So how serious can it be? Absolutely. Right. Okay. Hope you enjoy it. And take your rosary beads. Whether you have to have something to rub while you're watching. You know, those kind of movies. 560, 50560, 560, 560 on the AT&T line 10, 46, a QAN. Oh, better get this schedule. Say, oh, geez, better get in the right week now. We'll have to get all up set. He'll start tearing up in there in the other room. Hank is a chulous. We got Hank with net more at 5. Maybe Jimmy, we got a child to call in one day this week. We got the booster at 6. And then we got the jets at the Patriots. A rather important game not for the jessler for the Patriots. 845 of the pre-games and night. I'm on the night football. Only one South Florida radio station has the hammer. And you're listening. 3, 2, 3. We've got the afternoon to 2. Sports radio 560. QAN. The old... YAH. We are from the Patriots. We've got the Silver Square flag. Turn off your knocks. And the rain will tell us that we'll pass. And some people are be told. We will pay top here so on our ways of your reality. So as you're a f**ked pack, and be dead. We'll help his closest to us. Thank you. I've got the gear set off. The front is waiting for our two Echoes. We're at my two more Echoes. We're at the front. We've got the second gear on the narrowest thing. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the front. We're at the rear of my godware inauguration. This is obs la dieta. This is our world jeet. Someone's gonna burn down. backpackuing, cable We're insens. We brought your handsome apple sauce. Shut up, silly ass! Oh, son, there's a whale box! When we joined our night's got jotted wind, we waited for a little box. We waited for a little box. He and the man have explained how we need for our faiths, by all of those faiths, and we were so happy. You're a great friend, you're so great! Oh, that's pretty clear. Five, six, you're wc, I'm see that young guy that's called before, that was given me a son that's about the football and answers, and about Walter Peyton's stuck his hand and blocked the field goal, but then he got paired and didn't do the other one. You know, it's like the podcast on your kettle black. I mean, you said the same thing 15 different times and I agree with the point, but you're doing the same thing. Why do you know, we don't know what happens, you know, whether you go up there or you go down there. It's just, it's, it's, it's, it has me crazy because you've been conditioned to say these things. Yes, we do know, okay? In fact, step on a cockroach, hopefully you won't be a cockroach, just a little ant, all right? Next time you have an ant crawling in a kitchen, step on it, and like put it in the bottle and take a look, see if it goes anywhere. See if it goes up there, see if it goes down there. I think it'll still be in a bottle, until like kind of decomposes in about 50,000 years and it ate there no more. In 50 million years, it'll probably still be there. In fact, the ant had been here long before, we have it, probably, been here long after we are. But why do you have to say these things, because he's doing exactly the same thing, but he's not going to have to do it, saying these silly things that we're conditioned to say, all the God bull crap. Very interesting, pulled by the way in the hero of the day, which will get the gun not for a upset. What's the already instinct? Well, about Jeff Bush, and they'd, it's about 50, 50, it's about even Stephen. About the Jeffster, my me date, it's a little bit more supportive. I wonder why that is, huh? And date counting. What the fuck? He's a mine, who's Bush, yeah. But do you favor or oppose placing additional restrictions on handgun purchases in the US? In date counting, this is shocking. 78% of the people in date are in favor. 77% in Broward and Favor of placing additional restrictions on handgun purchases in the US. Only 19% again in date, 18% against in Broward. But Democrats, 76% in favor, 22% against they wide, and Republicans, even Republicans, 56% in favor, 42% again. How do you like that on your gun squeezing? Not out there. You want to fix? You maniacs? You freaking barbarians? You... You son of a bitch. Yeah, well, I wanted him to say it not me. Trigger locks. Look at that. 71% in Florida and Favor of Trigger locks. 80% in date and 86% in Broward. Even 68% of Republicans are in favor of the mandatory purchase and use of Trigger locks for all guns in the US. Abortion restrictions. See, the thrust of this article is that the Republican party is out of sync with the voters. I'm almost all the major issues. So I have no idea why somebody even keeps getting elected. Why, why George W's is so far ahead in those polls. When nobody has any idea, other than that he's a dummy and he's just a C student and he likes a little fun up his nose. Other than that, maybe. You favor or oppose new laws which replace additional restrictions on abortion. In date, county, 50% opposed 41% in favor and Broward, well, we know why that is. They're opposed to more restrictions on abortion in Broward 56% again 35% in favor. And even Republicans are like 1% apart, even Stephen Democrats 54% opposed 35% in favor. About discrimination against homosexuals. You favor or oppose enacting new laws to legally protect homosexuals from discrimination that obtaining jobs in housing. In date, county 56% in favor 31% against. Even in date, county 56% in favor in Broward, county 73% in favor, only 19% against. statewide, well, let's say statewide Democrats 62% yes 29% opposed. Even Republicans, how do you like this? Trent Lot. Republicans 63% I'm sorry, 50% in favor 39% opposed. You Republicans are out of step with a mainstream. I hate to break the news to you, but you're out of step. Maybe the BSO can, you know, can write another Bingo Hall in Ken Jenney, can switch parties. And about prescribing marijuana, which is your this one. You favor or oppose allowing physicians to prescribe marijuana for medical purposes. This is strictly for medical purposes you understand. In date, county 60% are in favor 32% opposed. Broward, county 59% in favor 29% opposed. Keep in mind that Broward, county, we got a lot of old farts out there. Who are probably saying, oh, that's bad. That's real bad. You're going to burn in hell. statewide 63% of Democrats in favor, only 26% opposed. And wait till you hear this. statewide 65% of Republicans are in favor, only 29% opposed. Legalizing marijuana for medical purposes only. You do understand that only, but nevertheless that's a start. Overwhelming majority even Republicans. So even Republican voters are out of step with a so-called Republican party on the major issues. Whether it's abortion, whether it's homoes, whether it's the wicked weed, whether it's the jepster, no matter what the hell it is. So I said, the Republicans, this and then 2000 just don't bother running any candidate. Okay. Just stop. Just stop wasting our time. Here's pop at OB, Chalo. Uncle Neil, Mr. Yes, sir. That, um, not to change your subject, but good first. The guy that called up about Walter Peyton blocking the kick. Yes. Do you mean he found a lot like the one that said there's no flags in the church? No, I don't know. No. I don't know. I don't know. He wasn't whining as much. He was not fact in the church. He wasn't squealing as much as that guy. That guy's a whiner. I got a couple of reviews. He was one of the reasons. I got a couple of Jewish friends named Charlie of that house. Really? Charles Rosney and New Haven Connecticut. And you got a friend of yours. Charlie Young with embroidery works. Yeah. I was just the same as a couple of people in Charles. But Chuck? No, I know. I know. Because what time I call my friend Charles and Connecticut Chuck? And he's taught me right there. It was no. You're right there. I'm very sensitive. Because when you're doing the supermarket, you see that ground chuck. And we're very uptight about that. I hear you. I got you on that. I talked about it all seasoning on it to make it tender. But anyway. Talk to the public. Is running something. When I'm the guy to call you from Sydney, Australia couple weeks ago. Yeah. Okay. When I was in Australia, they were just about to have their election on November 6th. The determine whether they were going to leave the British Monarchy or not. And they were comparing. You know, what would a public would be with the United States and other countries. Stuff like that. And this one guy wrote in the tutorial saying that there's 260 million people in America. And all we can come up with a George W. Bush, Al Gore, Bill Bradley. And then. But that's something, though. So that's been a long time. That's been a long time. That's been a long time. I know. And then on the second line. You know, George Bush senior. I mean, we can have some of the most mediocre people run this country. It's pathetic. No, it's ridiculous. And nowadays, now that people are getting, you know, My name is caucus. As soon as they're announcing they're running for dog catcher, all of a sudden, their whole life is exposed. And you know, it's, it's, it's garbage. Just garbage away things. Things are done in an media nowadays. And that's going to keep a lot of good people out of office for what you're going to do. That's the way it is nowadays. I have one question for you. I was out of town and I noticed that's what's talked. But I got to ask this because nobody can give me a real good answer. When they did the baseball top 100 team or whatever. And that guy Jim Gray interviewed Pete Rose. Yeah, what happened? I've heard so many people say so many different things. For the baseball, let Pete Rose take part in the ceremony. Yes. And when he was now selected by the fans and when he came out, he got the biggest of A lot of anybody all night. He's going to go out to the interview on NBC and grilled him and asked him about, Is he sorry? And doesn't he want to now come out and admit that he gambled. He said no. And he asked in the same question over and over and over again. And Pete became very upset as he rightly had a right to do. And Jim Gray was an asshole. And the NBC people are the ones who put him up to it. And it was a disgrace. And have a great day. Thank you. Okay. 20 to 11 at 5. 60 QAM. This is 5. 60 QAM. Dolphin's Hurricanes.

You only go around watching live. What does that got to do with you got the time? I don't know what hell it is. But that's the point of it. Okay, in fact, all your people are so religious that think it's so bad on earth and that they're so disgusted with life. Why don't we just kill those people, okay? Huh? Probably God's ready for them. Now it's their time. Why don't we just kill those people and send them to heaven and then they can have a good time and then they'll be more room and food and a good room on a highway for the rest of us.

And there's no thing with all these presidential candidates. Get clicking fine, a loophole like FDR and just stay as president. No. He found a holder too, but not the kind you're looking for.

Now, little bit of a bonfire goes what I see. When she's got a way back to the river. A little bit of a bonfire goes what I need. A little bit of a bonfire goes memory. A little bit of a bonfire goes here at M. I am a little bit of you. Oh my, my feet man. 14 is 1980 for him, just this morning. It's just over the bubble there in Orlando, which will reign for at Nadia Dumpdown. The crap. How do you like that? See, there are no different on that line than the other lines. So what the hell? There's a make. So yesterday, I made a bad, bad mistake. OK. I went over to see my good friends at Best Buy, which they love me nearby the way. A lot of very fine-looking young guys working at Best Buy. That's why I shot there. Even though they turned me a lot more than Brands Mart. nevertheless. So I go over there and I got myself a new computer, a compact MV 720. Top of the line. What is it? 700 millahhertz with that P-way? Yeah, that's, I mean, just as fast 56k, 700, and just the best. Very, very expensive. And of course, they give you a $400 rebate if you want to join up at PrimeG, which I did bad mistake. I hate PrimeG. Almost as much as I hate AOL. So my friend Dave spends all day from one o'clock yesterday, we got this thing home until about 9 o'clock last night, 7 and a half hours, parking with this thing, screwing around with it, trying, I mean, why did it make it so goddamn difficult to set up a new computer and then you still can't get what you want? It's still a piece of crap because you got AOL. I'm going to tell you something, AOL, those people they really shouldn't, that a screw in a row with Microsoft, they shouldn't go and after AOL. Those people make me want a bar. They have just got, and remember all the times I talked about, what you call it? Nine spring. Well, recently I say what you call it? They're not on any more. We got somebody new coming this week, but nevertheless, what am I high in man when you don't when you go back to AOL and you got busy signal after busy signal, then it has to start down another goddamn number. And then it comes up with all the pop-up ads by the time you get on the guy damn thing, you forgot what tell you were looking for in the first place. Yeah, by the time you get on there, it's limp, crased. So I was just asking George if we have DSL, phone line capability here in South Florida because that's the only way you're going to really get the super fast to be able to download either. It's too goddamn slow, even the top of the line, the most expensive computers, it's still too goddamn slow. The sit there and you wait and you wait and you watch that little line, the little blue line and stick in it, it's moving 21% 22 dollars. Come on already, okay? I want to got 15, 20 hours to pop ski around what is thing today. Slow. Here's a good review by the way of dogma. I don't know what see people send me these, it looks like time or newsweek doesn't it from the yeah, it looks like that. Can God take a joke, if he or she can there be a lot to laugh at Kevin Smith's Randy, but definitely to about dogma with Chris Rock and with L.A. N.S. Moore said who plays God, by the way, God is a woman. And the 13th of Possible Chris Rock was a Schwarzer. So what's wrong with that? So there's a good review a bit if you can't let shot there, well see I think most of the Catholics are not uptight about it. Just a few of the people from the institutions, you know who belong in one, hurry up tight because it's bad for business they think. Here's a mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Good morning. How are you today? All right. Here you know, you have been listening to you for some time and I really you really inspired me. The third about your show, you tell me the way they should be told. I called it. Big picture and you've mentioned something this morning about these are why nobody going not going to these games these professional games. Yes sir. Exactly. Neil, I'm on every day, Joe. I make over 265 or 7,000 dollars a year. But Neil, you can not afford it and these in the past, you know, these owners won't detect sales to build them stadium and detect sales call. It's been a time you write out of it. Right. I'm looking at the mixie. Excuse me, he's game right. Actually, big celebrities said that that 10,000, 3, 4,000 dollars a seat, you know, for games. It's pathetic. You can't afford it and you know, I give you credit for one thing. You tell them the way they are not paying people pictures as they well. I say about this team. Look what he did. He tripped the team. I mean, if they don't make it money back the next day, that's, I mean, I'm not going to say, you're nice. I'm going to say, if they're losing money, just like any other business, let him close down or let him pick up and go to the hotel. Why are you going to come and get the operate when you're losing money? That's right. That doesn't make a lot of steps. Amen. But anyway, Neil, I enjoy your show. I like the way you bring things to the forefront. You tell a lot of the people that run it all the year, they're not you tell the truth. Thank you. I respect you for that. I don't want to show. Okay. I'll get the free for us. Okay. Thank you. Good morning. Yeah. This business just like they go that big door ring in Washington, thousands and thousands of thousands of empty seats. Building where we need an LA thousands and thousands of empty seats. Then coming to find out by the way, the scandal with the LA times. That the LA times the company that owns it isn't to hoots with the people that built a new arena out there and they had a big advertising section that they made $2 million on by the way the LA times. And I'll be employees there and they're all up in arms because they have no journalistic credibility because all they care about is money. But nevertheless, the point being they build all the so I guess I guess all the new arenas are already obsolete. Well, and so the macroean army looks pretty good, but that's absolutely even we can't fill up people once this year. But we'll have to tear it down and build more sky boxes and club seats for millionaires because the regular ordinary pedestrian people they can't afford to go there anymore. This may sound revolutionary especially on his sports induced station here, the sports obsessive to a sickness station. But you know something, if they all want to pick up and go someplace else, bye bye, see ya! White goes on! That's the way I feel about it. Including the hockey team, the basketball team, the football team, the goddamn all of them. The guants in their sport hut and certainly John Henry. See ya! The idea that the fleeting of the average people out there and I'm not average. I make a lot of money. You know something, let me say it for the eight million times. If I had a paper to talk, he took it, is there any chance? I'd be paying for a season to get some out of these prices? Oh, and that's another thing. No matter how crappy the season is, no matter how gigantic and glorious, the public is just billin' it or reener for the owners like Wayne, the prices keep going up, every single goddamn year. And don't tell me because the salaries keep going up over here, because the public's not the ones paying these crazy salaries. Here's this kid, let me say it again, Sean Green, nice Jewish boy, they're played with the blue jays. $14 million a year from the Dodgers were already given out 15 million to Kevin Brown and are going to finish probably last again. We hope we pray. Crazy people. How about a salary cap for everybody? There is no athlete worth more than, and I'll be honest with you. I would put the figure a lot lower, but realistically speaking, five million years should be able to satisfy anybody. Five million. Could we, yeah, could we get five million here? Yeah, we could scrape by most of us. Somehow, even with those of you with large families, okay, you could probably scrape by, Georgia's he could do it for four million. He might be able to squeak by. And I'll just work one year than go away. There you go. That's right. Sounds good to me. So stop giving a public a song to dance. You're sticking it right up the public's spectrum is what you're doing, okay? And then a belly ache about well, gee, you know, we got a couple thousand and three seats. Every one of these glimpsing new joints, you look at him on TV and there are thousands and thousands of people there disguised as empty seats. That's right. Because you can only squeak so much blood out of a turnip. Air beer. How about putting the prices down a little bit so that your average shwucking go out there and take his kids and go and have a good time instead of a 1575 bucks per person to go see a guy named hockey game or baseball game. Cut the crap. That's what they should be telling instead of John Henry given lectures to the public. They should be telling him. Cut the crap. Here's Fort Latterdale. Hello. Hi, Neil.

But I'm tired of seeing Christopher Reeve. Okay. I was tired of seeing him before he had the wreck. I was tired of seeing him before. I don't like him. I can't can't deal with him. With that little pinched nose of his and he was always playing some fag. What was that movie he was in? With uh huh. You know the one where he played the uh the guy we was living with the British guy with a hand. What the hell is the British or actor? That's always in the line. Michael King.

What about 75 different fake endings? You know what's like it's like in uh you know all the different movies where the hand keeps coming back like in uh the Michael uh what's his name movie?

Well, here's the little girl that's been on there for about five hours because your children don't like the little girls except his own. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I am. Who are you calling? My name is Jenny. Hi, Jenny. My dad isn't to you all the time. Right. Here makes my family listen to you. He forces you at gunpoint. Yeah. Right. He's on my radius. The club, okay? He's on my radius. Radius? Yeah. Oh my god. That radius is your daddy. Yeah. I won't tell you all the stories I heard about him. Okay, sweet. Anyways, I'm calling for a decent Jacksonville and I wanted to tell him something over the radio. Uh-huh. It's an effect joke, so don't think I'm crazy. Yeah. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm going to call because I want to ask you a question. Yes, Jenny. What's your name again? Jenny. Yes, I said Jenny. Yeah. Why are you so mean to black people? Why are you so mean to black people? Why am I so mean to black people? Like what black people? You know, I mean that I've been mean to. I've never been mean to a black person in my life. Well, it's right here. I have a black maid. I treat her very well. I'm very nice to my black, uh, blackies. My black friends. Okay. I just call for that. Well, don't you know any black people? Yeah. And are they all nice? Yeah. They're just people. They're like people are people. That's right. Okay. How's there a big black guy standing outside the door right now? Will they're looking inside? No. Okay. Well, if there is, you call Danny right away. Okay. Okay. See you, Jenny. You're so mean to black by tytonis. He's sorry. See, let me say it again. I realized that you image your Americans. You don't know how to do business. A lot of you people just put the 50% with 2D for everybody. Then you don't have to pay. You know, instead of just, in fact, why not just stamp a thing on every check that says, since we know you're a bunch of cheap bastards, 15% has been added so that our weight staff doesn't have to get stiff every time. If you want to leave more fine and if you want to refund because you got crappy service, that's okay too. Tytonis, he's, he's, he's starting. And did you see the, you wouldn't see that you weren't here. They had all those demonstrators out there outside of tytonis on the beach. First of all, are there really that many black people on the beach? Oh, I think there were shipping them in. Yeah. I think Jesse Jackson will be down here another week or two. As soon as he gets up there and the caterer will it all. Jesse will be down here to take care of that. And then what that was in any of the tyrists run in Pembroke Pines that shit the lot of water, something like that. Yeah, that's the name of that. No, that's an ava. That, I don't know why you're so agh, that it's called, built CHITLRA, Chitlata, and it's in a food here is very, very kiddy. It's what they said. No, I said it was very good. And they had a black lady and they're very light-complexed by the way, which I'm surprised about that. And she ordered chicken. That's the name of the restaurant, George. Your just is running the faces rubber was last week. That's the name of the restaurant, Chitlata Roda. Well, I can't help it. I didn't pick the name. Jesus Christ. 560, 0560, pound 560, honey. You didn't hear that story? Yeah, this is just coincidentally right on the heels of tytony. We get another one. They should learn a lot of rata plays in the Pembroke Pines. And some very light-complexed black woman went in there with a six-year-old kid. And they did the same thing with her. And stuck up 15% on her because they said she was in there once before. And didn't leave any kind of a tip. And she said I was never in here before. She's pissed off. And probably getting a lawyer. 560, 0560, pound 560, honey. 18tony line. Our America's line is sitting there. Look at that. Wait, didn't hear that. It's not. I guess what all lines are working today. There you go. So far. So far. So good. Yeah. You should have seen last Monday and Tuesday. I had holling. I had puking. We had a tremendous comedy show out of it. It was unbelievable. 877, 785, Neil. 877, 785, 6345. We pay it. Here's Carl Springs. Hello. Yeah. Good morning. Yes sir. Some things. So first of all about the salary on the hockey players. There was an article on the Sun Sentinel on Saturday. The owners are an uproar. There are a lot of the teams are going broke. Who's the best? Two bad. Two bad. Vancouver is like ready to play a bank. They've got to have revenue sharing. They've got to have salary caps. And the fact that they don't have that shows how weak the owners have been. And they look guys like in New York like the Rangers with their 60 million dollar pay roll. They let just a handful of teams with all the big bucks. Spending and spending and driving the salaries up there. It's their own fault. Exactly. But what they did say was that the CBA, the collector bargaining agreement for the have with the players, expires and 2000. And there will be a year off. That's right. They're going to lose a year. They'll go out on strike and they'll have a bigger, better thing. But they're going to have to get it resolved then. Or it's going to be all over. Yeah. The owners are preparing a lockout. For sure. Yeah. Of course. How old can they continue? And then about. But again, how do you feel sorry for the owners when they're the ones that have been given a guy damn money in the first place? Exactly. Well, there's really no victims here at all. They'll get to. So there are victims. The public are the ones that are the victims. The public are the victims. The people who are given their tangible support and have been enthusiastic and supported these teams for years. They're the ones who are the victims. This is infected almost all of professional support. Right. That's right. Now the other thing is about your computer. Your cable company can help you up with their own DSL line and you're on all the time. Really? Yeah. There's never a busy signal. At least in quarrel springs with if the landscape will I'm on with the computer and you're just on all the time. So you cable from the DSL, I mean DSL from the cable company. Absolutely. And there's never a busy signal because you're always on. So I don't understand how that works though. So in other words, your computer is hooked up to the cable as opposed to the phone line. No, the cable company brings in a bring-in line over the phone line. Yeah, over the cable line. Over the phone line, rather. Whatever. Yeah, over a subline. Yeah. But it works. Okay. Okay. Thanks. So what do you say, George? The, I hear a bit of no. And see, it's complicated. It's complex. Why don't they tell us these things? Why doesn't somebody tell us? For Christ's. You're supposed to be a genius. It's supposed to work. There's some 10 year old kid. That's a computer. There's one. I'm gonna tell you. Oh, yeah. Here's what you got to do. We're a bunch of old farts. We don't know anything about this crap. Here's sunrise. Hello. Yes, sir. Great. I tried NASCAR this weekend. No boy. Oh, boy is right. Thank God. A lot of good old boys down there. That's what Joe Costello said. He said a good time was had. Scary, pregnant women with no teeth. Right. It's a sight to behold. Hmm. But after 60 laps, but then going around in the circle with no crashes. It was like times ago. Yeah. I mean, it was just, it was terminal. I mean, that was, that's all. I couldn't even have the, didn't even have the common decency for one little crash. Yeah. That's pretty boring. It's terrible. About AOL. If everybody calls him up and says, you're going to cancel. They'll keep giving you free months. Because they don't want to lose you because they need to have. Like 50. I don't know your boss writing them. I would just like service that's acceptable. They don't know how to give that. I'm sorry. You're right. There's companies that give free internet service. But if it's over the phone line, it will always be interrupted. Yeah. The last call that was said with the DSL whatever. I don't know nothing. It's digital. You get it right through Bells out. It's built on your phone bill. So, but it's not Bells out provides that. Yeah. A separate cable. It's not on the phone. Right. So, you could actually use the same line while you're on. I don't know how they do it. But it's a get separate cable. That's what it is. And it's digital. You download in a second. You can get all the pornograph, put a picture in the second. Yeah. So, it's really good. It's a little bit more. But you don't have to install second lines. It's just like, well, I don't want to rob you. No interruptions. No interruptions. It's really good. Excellent. I'm going to be on a immediately. One last thing. In Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. Carl's. and it said don't play must i don't play new guys okay i blame the company for being about your hard asses and in that that will play the little guy except the one to the school with our phone service then i then i do blame here's north by any hello in the oh yes sir i got your school on the dsol with bell foul okay it's so uh-huh uh-huh here's what happened after waiting ten days for installation they came out on Friday to fifth and installed yeah on the following one today i have no service well i'm calling when the day through day Friday finally on Saturday day it's determined that they pulled the wire that the central office off and i don't have service the one put an order into the determinator service and i was just fll yeah and i've been after spending hours and hours it six hours alone Saturday evening try to make a nice suck it and let me tell you something they said okay give it about 48 hours like it back in you should be back in service this morning seven thirty being is right back on again surfing like crazy would it run is like icing on the cake yeah but at nine thirty just as the stock market's opening it's trash another order placed it's term terminated service it's one taken till least six seven o'clock tonight to get it back on great but let me tell you something if you've got the opportunity i think out there in the plantation you have a roadrunner service don't you would be a little world runner yeah what's with the UK okay i'm on the way to work this morning yeah you know well what you can see if you can get that is twenty dollars cheaper a month offering free installation currently and but unfortunately just like the phone company the cable company really has no record of reliability so under the you got to get that through the cable company you got to get the cable company you got to get the cable company you're trying to call a cable company it's the same thing i think i think hours on it waiting for the phone company everybody should be each other and unfortunately now this is one of the problems there's no backing up from the public service commission for this high speed access so if you've got a problem with them you have to hammer it out great so i'm i'll bring the hammer out he'll straighten it up okay thanks i think i'm going to take my new computer my beautiful new compact what's the number mv 720 very expensive very atop and i'm going to put it in the pools after you know how you maybe somebody down there can straighten it up three minutes till noon at five sixty q a m this is five sixty q a m

internet company down here in homestead and we provide service to the date in broadwood county areas i heard it's a little bit confused on the cable mode and ds all thing and i understand that it's extremely confusing that's it is a little note though that let you know we before we start our internet company we had a delfiest power link which is the cable mode and act that some days it was very good i mean you're downloading very fast it was wonderful other days it was extremely slow and then it started getting more slow and slower because more people were on it exactly right and the same thing goes for the dsl it's very good right now i have a couple of friends that have the dsl through uh delfsl they say it's great sometimes the things a couple of people get online and it gets slower right now um one of the solutions that we did for our customers is a dual-modeum connection which means that you are constantly going at a hundred and twelve k and that's a dedicated you know that's a make sure that you're always going one twelve i mean yes not you know going uh one point five megabytes per second but you know it's dedicated you always know that you're always in a download at that speed and that that's something you know that's reassuring that way it's not like one day you're going fast and then the next day you're going like a little low you know but um i wanted to let you know that if you're still at home and you're kind of confused about the whole thing to go check out our website okay what is it? www.ilds.net i-lcs.net correct into the computer service and check out

that the BS got their sights on But the Bingo people, the Bingo people, M2 The games of chance had gone silent And the spastic shout had faded The spastic, I don't know that, the spastic shout As in Ehh But closing time, or another bread of excitement To the old time, Bingo Parler, one night earlier This year in North Lauderdale Shortly after the evenings, patrons had filtered out Broward Sheriff's Office deputies, that's the BS And North Lauderdale police Rated the gambling hall, hauling off everything From electronic bingo boards, the financial records in a few hours Just like those cruise ships, anybody remember that? The day they had to bring them back with their tail between their legs Can Jenny, again, you would bobby butterworth the fascist of Florida Rating everybody everywhere there's something evil Gambling and God forbid maybe even six The good time pulleys are ready to get And then this is, you know, it's a charity place It's a charity goddamn thing, a nonprofit agency Richard, you're a president of families of charity, a family charity of Brown Inquilchoperate living in Gopartal said, we've got a cloud over our business now We've been watching our charity go down the tubes for nothing No arrest of been made, or charges filed against him Or anybody else associated with a bingo hall since the raid But let's put everybody out of business Let's make sure that everybody sits inside the house 24 hours a day when a night outside work in a go to school With their hands folded Kissing their little Ken Jenny blow up doll or whatever their support Bobby butterworth doll, what a sad sad place Like I said, let's hear it for Dave County I mean we've got a lot of good things in Broward County And then there are a lot of bad things that we don't have in Broward But we have Ken Jenny, which makes up for a lot Here's a mobile in Fort Latterdale, hello Hey Neil, what's going on? Yes sir Well, I've put a lot to talk about this adios, so we're just capable more than one You're so sorry I brought this up, sound like the brick and such old I am You know, I'm a certified engineer from Microsoft, I installed networks So I learned the both ways of it in which way is better which way is best I didn't know why you were complaining about ALO What things to be wrong? You're having a big problem Because it's slow because it disconnect 8 million times in the middle of whatever you're trying to do And because you get a busy signal after busy signal And because you get those stupid pop-up ads all the time It's not good, it's bad, it's a bad ISP Okay, a couple of things, people have been covering their calls with true semantras 8 ESL, it's asymmetrical digital subscriber line, the word digital Rob band for all of which words for all of the advertising is analog So you have old versus an adisL, or on your same phone line Same dedicated line, that means that no matter how many people are on line No matter what time of day it is, you're going to have your dedicated speed And in this case, the bell south is 1.5 megabits download per second You can idea you right now, you know, 56K modem Actually, see regulations say that you can't go faster than 53 ALO, you probably can connect to 28 Yeah, more than 20, yeah Okay, so that's 28 kilobits A megabit was a thousand 24 kilobits So without being too technical, bottom line, you're looking at about 1500 kilobits As opposed to 53, which is the FCC law That's on the download, the upload is 250 Kable, I believe it's 400 on the download now in your area They, if they don't have two-way cable meaning that you send them a C but 400 You're not going to get it because the browser-tonic commission That's the law saying that anyone coming in regarding internet service Any technology they develop has to be made available at no profit To their competitors Meaning 18, she comes in, leaves the fiber optic ground network So they can charge everyone for a two-way cable modem That means they've got a cello to ALO, to anybody, and not make a dime So I talked to 18, to NGC, I wouldn't was And they said they have absolutely no plans for any expenditure on e-growth Because it's anti-competitive and they're countered, they're actually suing proud of coming government because of it AD, the ISDN someone talked about the 104K Yeah, we have a, we have a thing for that, and it means I still don't know Because it's so slow, it is dedicated but so is ADSL I obviously have the ADSL service, I got it when it first came out from DLSO Because I knew what it was, DLSO was in no way prepared to handle ADSL when I got it And I mean to the tune of like 14 pages of history with me and DLSO And the customer service line, however, I'm happy to say that they seem to have, I end out whatever bug they have And the service is great, the download speeds are incredible I like to tell a lot of games online, so speed is an important thing Yeah, one of our friends who used to have media one had a one way And you know, in the afternoon, you know, 1112 in the afternoon In his neighborhood, no problem because you know, it won't work But when people come home as private clock, this year, DLSO was only a couple main lines that bring cable service through your neighborhood So whenever one gets on, it basically draws a bit with and splaces it up into everyone who's connected ADSL, I think if there are how many people will have share your phone line to your house None, so it's only you. And I've been on three-way conversations online, playing games, testing my download speeds, and they've been for now Alright, so what does BellSouth have to do if you do that? They have to put another phone line in? No, same phone line. What that happens is, ADSL runs on a different frequency And what happens is, you have your frequency bouncing for your voice on one speed and your frequency bouncing for data on another speed But they will do is they'll probably come in and connect with the call in ADSL, splitter slash filter in your main line And that's probably in your kitchen and it's, you know, if you have a pinging phone, it's a little box that's Retrochrome a wall about an inch and it's no really that it's no further than the phone with itself And they'll connect it there and they'll connect a separate jack for ADSL But there's no extra wires and it's on the same phone line A lot of people can call you after this, but the bottom line is, and I'm not trying to say, you know, I just, I do this for living So if anyone else calls you with anything different, just tell them to check their facts and look it up and they'll see this is the way ADSL is Like I said in the beginning, BellSouth was prepared now, like it's also regarding flash com Because I looked at them strongly as well, the speed for the money is not worth it and the customer service is nonexistent Okay, 49.95 on month if you have the complete choice plan from BellSouth Okay, thanks. Okay, appreciate it. Okay, do I know what I'm doing now? Why is it that every time I get into something like this, no matter what it is, computers I mean you name it, and everybody who calls means, well, like this, got me, he's an A on expert, he's a a He's a very important expert, but by the time I get done, I'm just living with it like that. So what he said, he said the road runner blows chunks 21 before one at five, 60 WQM's plan. I need help. I have a hairy chest. I have a hairy chest. I have a hairy chest. Real men have hairy chest.

I've been using NL well since they won and I get some of the best gate corn sites that you can find. Yeah. Okay. Good. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line, 877, 785, Neil. Yeah, Neil on this pal. Here's a mobile in four-laterdale. Hello. Mobile in four-laterdale. I hear you, I hear you're clicking it. What is it? What kind of a line is this? Other there. There. There. They're just the podcasting weather. Hello. Hello? Yes. Good afternoon, local, Neil. Yes, sir. Sorry, I had my head set off for a second. Well, those are what again. I look for a very large computer company, which I don't know if I'm sure I can say the name on the ear, but it's a blue chip company. Yeah. That's a little head. You probably got a million calls off there on the internet, no matter what cable service or DSL service or whatever you get. Yes. I can, if you like, I can stop the album. You know, with your computer and make it all work and explain it to you in English, which probably not a whole lot of people can do. Especially nowadays with computers. You've got a lot of people who are fantastic with the machines, but don't know how to work with the people. And I'd be happy to help you out if you like to take my name or number off the ear. Okay, you're a little taken. Thank you. Don't tell them. I'm so sorry I brought this up. We were having a really good show there for most of the show, and then I brought this up. And then it was full in the plug. That was the end of that. Sorry, I apologize profusely. And as far as, you know, and we got the road runner guy, they want to hook me up on that thing like even before I get home. We got the DSLR from the phone company and all the other crap. Too many gizmos and just not enough time. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, we got about 14,000 open lines right now. I can't even begin to imagine what. I apologize, even the Rick Riley, I apologize. Only one South Florida radio station has the hammer. And you're listening to me. Superoper. We've been to the app minutes of two sports radio 5, 60, Q, A, M. Check your dad's juice. Is it done or a lead or does it involve your behind? Stumped, turban, things that only gaze to this. Most states have lost. Could be jail or pay a fine. The Senate now must pick with your faith. O'er, the me. Peter Pop for the cold, right. Archbath for on business, me. O'er, the front door so bad, just go and that's the dinner. You know, all these my naces in the Senate, you'll have a seat. People without healthcare, so flagging livelihoods. The way they act is really what is lose. Well, they're helmets to model specter. And horned by a pack of wood. No matter where you sit, get, we get screwed. Look about me. The Senate's lost its mind. There's hunger, drug, and crime, God knows. Look about me. There's a Vietnamist time with killings on the Lishio. All right. 13256, the WDQM, so somebody sends me a stake-in-shake menu in the mail. With other locations all over time. No. No. The WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the WDQM, the UN elected leader. Larson Boy. Dean. His name is OYST-EIN. Oh. Dean. Face is charged as a legally dumping oil off the coast of California that lying about it. And under government video released earlier this year, showed another World Curb-inship Anaction, the cameras investigator say called workers dumping chemicals and oils into the sea, sometimes through secret types. How do you like that? So take your cruise ship and shove it you old fossil, okay? Perfect for you. World Farts like you. Anybody out of the age of 100 stay off those cruise ships. Now I have a terrible confession to make. What? No, I have a confession to make now. And of course it's only about something I've done in the last or I discovered I've done in the last couple of minutes. Thanks to one of our wise guys out there in radio land. That sends my name in, you know, they have this world vision thing where you adopt a starving kid in Latin America somewhere. So I have a confession to make ladies and gentlemen. I have a steps on who will be starving to death because I'm not sending them anymore. That's right. Am I going to send them any money? Oh, because it's got a picture in here, boys, the ugly. Perfect. What have a size of those eyes? That's those very sad, big brown eyes. And I think it puts them leftovers in a ziplock bag and that'll be a little bit more. No. Alex, Joaquin, for all his. He's in the sand cell that here's his address. Here's Alex's address. And I'm his whatever whatever it is. His sponsor, so should we add you whatever it is? Here's my letter. Este maro amigo. Oh, of course it's an espanyol. Quiero tomar esta y oportunidad para expresarle. Me cincero, or whatever that is. Por el compromiso, que hacho, they say round, whatever this is, de niños de world vision. Bienvenido a nuestro familia. No, no, El Paso. Sił compromiso, mezzo, mezzo, mezzo, mezzo. Are you dera? No, I'm not sending nothing to Alex. Okay, Alex, you're going to be starving to the palace. I'm sure you're nice to the young boy, but no. He's used to, they see, are they? Are they? Okay, in Quanto, he's he's he's he's he's what is that? History rectum, I uno de estos mis hermanos más pecinos. Ami los, this is that word again. That's from San Mateo 2540. I never did New Jesus was in San Mateo. He was, well, there's all those missing years. Remember between 12 and 12. That's where he was. He was on the most coast. That's why he looked like that. Like a hippie. He was probably at Berkeley too. Los Adudamentoos, El Fueleto de Alex, Joaquín Flores, que continené a continene, continene. Su foto, a historia, oh yeah, he's the favorite, the subject is math. His grades, muy buena. Favorite game, alapelota. Or he likes Pablo Pelota, he said. Yeah. His name of, what is proyecto? What is that? Name of his project? Oh, the number of his petania. What was that mean? There is. No. What's the reality? What could argue? I'm doing better here with my spikton. You are. Come on, esteño, say, encuentrore, dysparadio, he's desperate. He's desperate. He's desperately, my health. He desperately needs my help. No. Isn't that sad? Somebody because there'd be an a wise guy. This kid isn't going to get any other sugar daddy. He needs my help. I will. He needs my money. I will. I give it to my fool. I will. I give it to my assistant. I will. I give it to you. No. And here's his address in San Salvador, I said, well, my, here's a kid that's going to be starving. That's not because of me because I'm silly spikot there. Sent in my name and he'll rob you to sponsor some kid. How do you like that? What are we going to do about this? Getting justice much as he would have gotten anyway. Yeah, nothing. This is very sad. It says when you write, please include your number. I'm translating now very good, but please include your number and the number, identification number of your child in the, in the card, card, in the letter. Uh, and that's as much as I can understand. So there you go. We got a little dilemma here. Maybe we'll have to use Alex's address out there on the, on the year that we can raise him a whole bunch of money. Maybe a five ounce gets enough. I'll split it with him. Yeah, hey, I can't come on a year and beg for money for myself because I make it a lot of money. But I can come on and beg for money for a poor little Alex, a lot of nonsense, Salvador, who desperately needs my help. Not just ordinarily, one of the mill needs my help. Desperate them, I'll meant they whatever that is. Maybe someone knows how to say kick back and spend. Yeah, kick back. I'm just going to kick back right here in the chair. And Alex do the work. Raise the money. Yeah. How do you like that? Scandalist, Neo Rodgers with a starving steps on. This is like one of those Registro open stories. Only worse. 22 till 2 at 5. 16 of an QM. I just bills in front. The other company, who QAM, gone Tom, for all the latest dolphins information in your country. We've been great friends. Frank beat the broadcast. Fort radio five, 60, the UAM. I just want to eat the house. I know that all of us, American dollars on the water company. We are 22. Hey, you're out of the blockbuster building flight club. Then you'll love Brad Pitt. It is scorching sequels. The first rule of our city club is don't tell anyone about our city club. Yeah, well, I don't agree to that. But how do you not agree with that? Are you kidding? It's promising exclusionary. It's not. Yes, it is. Our human club, co-starring at Norton as the reluctant participant. How can I know anything about myself as a man if I've never been an argument? I disagree. I think your reasoning is fundamentally flawed. You're such a reactionary. And our human club critic's agreed. It's definitely not as violent as the original. We're going to take on the club up a notch. Who's with me? You know, that's a tad rash. Shouldn't we debate the frozen conference? I don't think so. Well, I do. If you category on what movie to see this weekend, then agree to disagree and see argument club. Now playing is the Washington City. Oh, it's not. Yes, it is. It's not. Yes, it is. 17, 22, at 5.60, WQAM. In Elombre, they crystal. Richard E. Stirren's president, they will visit US. See the problem, this is the way we believe that this is legitimate. This is a good way to let a guilt trip on somebody is to enroll somebody on the same thing. They send you this thing and they even got the kids shoe size and a picture here. And on his address. And you have the feeling like, well, if you throw it away, he's certainly not going to get another chance. Right? He's not going to know. Seriously, poor little Alex there. Look at him. How about what you see? He's nine or ten years old. Look at a picture. Yeah. Maso, I may not see. Eight. Not recently, probably. No. I can't tell you. You have eight weeks waiting for my check. Huh? Now, he looks a little lady, may she hit it, of course, he's in San Salvar. But you can send us in Jerky. It'll keep. No. Let the Jamaican send him the Jerky. That's a good thing. Hey, you Jamaican, do you want to send him some Jerky? Yeah, I'm on. Okay, send the Alex. And if I don't respond to this, he's going to starve to that. And I'm going to go to his parents. Huh? I'm going to probably bring you a paper about that. And I'm tearing up all poor little Alex. I just tore up his picture. And I tore up all this stuff in all the literature and whoever the speaker is that sent this is. Shame on you. It's not going to be on my ass. It's not going to be on my ass. It's going to be on your ass that poor little Alex down there in El Salvador is starting that because instead of a real person who wanted to get involved in this thing, his sponsor, you've got me who I had no interest in that. Because number one, I don't know if he's really going to get the money. And number two, you know, what a bunch of crap that is. I'm already supporting enough people. I don't need to support the stranger from God damn Central America. So I hope you sleep real well. You'll only all whoever sent this crap in. I hope that Jesus picks on you when you see him in San Mateo. Hope he singles you out of the crowd and gives you watch for. Is that in Dread? Here's Hollywood. Hello, Mr. Niel. Yes, sir. I've been down here in my sense. This is over. I'm going back to civilization in three weeks. And I want to take a buy and say thank you for a. I'm going to introduce and tell each other to the 7th floor. I've been trying for about a hundred years, Bill. I know you have. Well, I'm going to reach Lee from Boston. And I wanted to say when I was hearing you talk about that little boy. Maybe you could give it to Roy and then Roy could have a golf tournament. Then you'd go for an opportunity. I did an idea. And we can rather get old J back here for that again, too. It's Roy. I'm curious to see the one who does a spotlight at night for one of your sponsors, a commercial company in our ticket. Yes, that's him. I'm going to leave. I'm going to call them today. The other thing I wanted to say. I am. I'm going to tell him why I would never buy anything from because it's ridiculous. But I don't want you to get in any trouble. Before I go, I wanted to say that I'm going to watch and have outborate. And he's the closest thing to Bobby or that I've seen in a long time. Yeah. Well, everything's different kind of player. Yeah, but he makes everybody around a play a little better when the other people are off the edge with them. You see a little bit better skipping their skating and they finish out their checks. And I think he's a great addition. And I hope the people down here will be smart enough to appreciate the talent. No, they don't know who he is. And for me, it's back to New England. My sentence is over. Good luck. Okay. Good luck, you pal. Thank you. Okay. There's a guy going back to New England. A civilisation up there with almost cracking New Englanders. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Here's a call in Naples. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing today? Pretty good. The first reason is to help jack up the bill on this interplanetary line. Good. And the second reason was I haven't heard you talking about the earthquake yesterday afternoon. What would you like me to say about it? It was bad. People died. Well, I mean, what is there to say about the earthquake? Well, are you talking about the same one? I'm talking about the one I felt here yesterday afternoon. The one you felt there? Yeah. I could feel it all over here in Naples. Yeah, and where was it from? Well, it was when Doug flew through that past Eric mold. Oh, yeah. And all the dolphins fans jumped off the band lag. And that one? Right. That must be what I felt the tremor while I was there. I remember that computer. Yeah. I felt tremors. In fact, it were in my home. Are they ready to hang Dane and next to Dane? Oh, yeah. They're off his bandwagon already. They want Dane back. When's you going to get back? Let's get the carapracted. A fix up his neck and went Bany coming back. And, you know, they lost again. They need people here. Oh, seriously, I don't have to do it. And the biggest phone is that ever came down the pike. All they came out to do was lose one game and they're ready to look for blood. I figured that. Yeah. I don't get the hero. Those shows in the morning while you're very local. You're so very fortunate. Have a great day. Thanks. Thanks for running up a good bill. All right. Say how do they want to be these two? 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 1, 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5. Neil is at whatever that line is. They're running up the bill line. 8, 7, 7, 7, 8, 5, 60, 3, 45. Look at that. That thing's starting to move a little bit. Now that we're almost done today. And again, I apologize to myself. Not to you people. We're kind of a more on AMI. Don't I know that Rick Riley almost put himself off of you with a computer talk? And that stock market crap. See, and I admit, unlike him at least he knows a little bit about computers. I know nothing. And I don't want to know. All I want to do is have one that works so good. And just whether it's supposed to do that's all. When you go out and spend 2500 bucks for a goddamn computer, it would be you would like to have it work right. See there you go again. Sorry. Here's some rice, hello. Yes, sir. You know, how you doing? Pretty good. Okay, I'm just a live remote for my bathroom here. I'm looking at a 10 year old. Oh, my God. I'm talking on the radio with my pants down. It's kind of amazing. I'm looking at a 10 year old spin magazine. Yeah. It's from October of 89. Yeah. It's an interview with Hunter Thompson. Listen to what it just a little spot. It says, and this was an 89. I'm very familiar by the way. Go ahead. Okay. Now we're being heard into the 90s, which looks like it's going to be a true or generation of swine. A decade run by cops in Horton's generation without humor, without mercy. Dead heroes and diminished expectations. History, I mean, a decade that will go down in history at the gray area. Right. At the end of the decade, no one will be able to have any names. That's a pretty much the beta rule. Sexual kill you. Politicians lie and rain is pointing. Right. Oh, and the world is run by horse. And that's 10 years. I mean, men, did he hit it on the marker? What? Him and what's his impetitrious ski? Yeah. They were on it. Okay. Well, listen. Okay. Good. 560, 560, ponp 560 on the AT&T line. What was that online night? What was that? That rang before. Somebody wanted to know if you were going to make the parents before it mayors. No. In fact, I think we're all done with appearances this year. We had a decent turnout there. We had a lot of very nice people there, I'd specs and Saturday. And let me say again, I appreciate more than I can ever convey them. The specs, people of instance, and satial. They put up a real great display and buy your best to the LCD, because that's in a specs all over date, proud and Palm Beach and in Fort Myers. And we appreciate that very, very much. But they've been stupid. I think that's a very good thing. I think that's a good thing. But I think, you know, one of those appearances and off you got all those dumb picture cards. And, you know, almost maybe some of the same people want to come back for seconds. Jacob did not show up, by the way. I don't know where Jacob lived. Jacob didn't show up. Lot of very fine listeners out there showed up on Saturday. Jacob Jacob did.
