Now, Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QA have why you air in shit like this? Well, now don't you tell me to lie, I'm not that monocussic fat dad, but start a positive I can't deny a big hit hit a rip off. Who knew my presidential juice was squirted on you, mother mother caught on the old town, a roll there for sick realist now, making out with mother caught in my limit. I couldn't have picked up that a bimbo, feeling patriotic at the black hole smoke, I'm a old boss in nearly two, which is not done by a big fat realist, started to scream like an old ill-fated ill-ridden man, found a body, it's still a weak kid, don't worry. Into this game I know can't breathe in, so it's a demon, a demon, a demon, a demon, a demon, and a demon. If we start report, I really can't cope, I'm a president, not a friggin' post, but time is now, and I'm calm and pleased, I like my movies with chowest and creased, the boredom and heels say they may you in peace, or we're getting searched by that true time and leach, time to hire a cock, pretty to these legit, if you didn't spit, they must be Christian, whether it's from the door for instance, the floor, some trouble hella reads like a appetite joke, never stop the ill-re the dollar, no, you don't get busy with january, no, you can't stop it, there's a one for me above, I'm gonna got stuck, but I should not come, stand the death, I'm gonna kick it up, stand, excuse me, general bum, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna stand, I'm gonna tast on the seeds and the bicell priests, I'm gonna construa r didz, I got aபaaatashi yapmış, ward someearwing, secondiger from im coming up to зем shootings, go and get some free Turoma, blindreckers, runner-in, find free Kid's Dead weapon, 1, make foul and clear gunna firing IQ no된 in an appropriate intel.:] Forget you, vuelge wegh," I'm gonna see if I can, I'm gonna run up�� try to run up a wall and has bad self-contro junction, I should consider that moreballs are rooted for it, hoping this Huntingman must have, they probably have a real festival dream. It's right on the way to the arena, and if I had any brains, I would have gone and walk bus to of the game that this morning 9.35 a.m. while I was sitting here listening to music which George is the witness not listening to the worst team. I did listen this morning come out of work by the way hoping you get some information about windpuffl berewl be back and how long that the spring knee is going to be acting up at set of insula which I really heard nothing about that. But anyway I do get a spy report about the fact that Joldi is like desperate at this point and looking to get into a piss and contest with me. It could have happened this week. And the only reason I spent two minutes on the show yesterday responding is because I was talking about something that you said that you were wrong about something specific not just making you know a personal attack like I have to prove myself to this little pitch Queen because you made a mistake about the oflurry and just respond to that he responds by making a personal attack. Let me just say this and then I'll move on to the real show. Joldi every person I know in a business including the two long-hage you work with on the show in a morning. Everyone that agrees on one thing you don't belong on here. You can talk about CBS and Westwood one and this one that everybody I know in this industry agrees on that point. You don't belong on the air but be side that. So anyway NBC six calls George this morning to show you I'm gonna touch it this is gonna be a day I thought we had to ball game today I have my day to run that's tomorrow we have a short show we have a short one so today I got a long one. I am just gonna go eighth because everything that I see you know air of a single day that I live in this town it bears out what I've always said. Next we think oh god and I might even know what I'm talking about some of the time. Including some of the mail I got this morning which I'll say for a little later on by the way some really juicy mail. Last night I mean what what words can you use other than choking dogs to describe that third period at the macarine last day. What words could anybody what vocabulary could you possibly have to describe what we saw and then before that I did hear the last three minutes because I turned him on it or up before we come on here this every morning. See now I understand why Jeldi didn't know about the theory incident in this game the other night and that he wasn't playing on the first power play line for Colorado because he lives in the apartment facing the wrong way. That's been Jeldi's probably most of his life it's been facing the wrong way or maybe when he applied for the job here it was facing the right way. Maybe that's why he got it. So he doesn't have no dish so he doesn't see those games. He just goes on here and makes stuff up and talks about stuff he doesn't have any talking about and here's deep hole on there adding more misinformation about all Sean Burke and our solidies played all year and go for the Panthers and last night that third period he couldn't stop a bowling buff. You know here is a guy that was abandoned he was just left out there by himself. It was as though as soon as Paul Bell Burrey and this is the same team keep in mind that in Detroit in hockey town USA last Friday training for one and the third period came from behind for an unbelievable five five pie. Same team. And last night choking dogs would be an understatement that was the most grotesque and granted it was the worst official any ever seen in my life there's no question about that Lance Roberts was on acid but I don't hear them while say one thing even the front runners in this town even the dubious people in this town aren't using that as an excuse this was the most inexcusable collapse. And especially with Burrey out in the pinning on when he's going to come back because you know there are two Panther teams there's with Pavel and there's without with him without. With you got a bunch of guys who out there who are inspired to and some of them play like they actually have some idea what they're doing like they have a fire in the belly like they really believe they can do something. And the minute that he's back in a locker room because he's re-induced the knee because he got thrown to the ice with no penalty called by the way in the second period and he's not going to be able to come back to the third period. This team pulls this is a team that was ahead five nothing with two minutes left in the third period and the second period last night. Twenty two minutes left in a game. And I'm sure that there are people who left you know it's five one at the end of the second. People who probably left I'm sitting there thinking well we gotta go to public you know the dog food and soda routine public closes at eleven. The baby's stay for about half of the third period and get out of here. And before you know it right off the bat in the third it's five two then it's five three then it's five four or no actually it was five two then it was six two but there was Robbie in the crease again. Under the cause law school second game in a row here's Robbie in that blue area maybe Robbie's color blind maybe somebody I'd like to show him where that thing is and the crease too. And that just at that point that was the end that was finito. As soon as that goal was rapidly disallowed and rightfully so because he's in there with both skates in the crease second game in a row. Robbie you don't got it sweetheart. You got the ability but you don't have the the firing ability I've been telling you that for years he's never gonna make it he's never gonna do it all the apologists all the guys that want to quote him and interview him he's a big part of the problem man. Big part of the problem can he was pathetic last night. I'm afraid I have to say that that could have been the that right there but you saw last night or what you heard about that could have been really for the panthers as we know them this year. Ten minutes after ten and five sixty wq if you want to go pick out and have a great meal and forget about all your troubles like that hockey game last night it was just a game okay but you know suicide sounds in order. Yeah, come on over here don't be shy. they ok OMG?! You smell so good, that smells good. Yup. That's right. SWEET Of Anybody? With you? Must be the fact! GAM pulp is giving Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmas Christmashog Monster! I'm gonna be the top five for you. You can't even find it. You're a fool. Oh, I'll be one and be with you. You got me.

Dead, he died, how do you like that? Well then we got all kinds of Dusty Springfield got a little more, I'm not getting another beat for this, I'll, by the way, essential perfect harmony has got some really a funky cut on it for example um... it's got like the original mono version of got only knows but it's got the uh... demo version of in my room and uh... all kinds of really neat stuff and how could we have forgotten talking to beach boys yesterday oh how did you have forgotten mister music all the only interesting enough that's one of the very few records and maybe that's the only one i can think of ono what about um... barber and that was the region state that was a uh... copy of another uh... she by was by the mystics which were one of my favorite all-time records usually they wrote their own stuff in those two particular cases but anyway we'll get back to that later so i started to mention before i saw really interrupted myself see out i didn't be see channel six called yours this morning can they send a crew over here to take me old the talking about monica louinsky today no i mean now are they how they're mine i'm gonna talk monica louinsky today no of course not did i see any of it no do i care about no now the only thing i saw this morning in relation to it was a course that all the morning talking hitchhows were just sucking up on it like crazy and sitting around talking about either i would have a press they were with her or unimpressed like who gives a crap and then i'm a suspect you know i think all those drugs and booze may have fried his brain he is a real asshole talking about uh... that fat slobb of bubbard about the disgusting and about how young and naive she is how how does everybody off you know if you want to waste the money and i don't know what Andrew Morton's book is going to say and it's out today and i'm not going to buy it or have anything to do with it but i wonder how much is going to be in there about you know that when she was 17 years old she broke up the other guys mirage to get it with like 24 years old and she was screwing him she's been a slot for as long as anybody could remember and she brought her presidential neepad the washing in so she could talk about suck you know and she admitted it last night yeah but she's a young and innocent and he took advantage of her come on talk about getting off in life with a free pass and all of she wouldn't have kept the dress you to commit suicide and her parents would have committed suicide what in why would they commit suicide there would never been any more story that would be the end of it she's sorry she kept it she said yeah oh yeah that before after somebody wrote it the next check god i mean all i could say about that is if you want to put it on nbc channel six that's fucking it that's my comment that's all i got to say that there nothing more needs to be said get a life and speaking of local media that's said we see they want to talk about that blow job story but i want to talk about a story in a macro relapse that was a much bigger blow job one of the biggest blow jobs in the history of the human race so again hold my mean when when calarado scored i mean keep in mind it's five two one four to go into the third period it gets to be five to four with a few minutes left and i'm thinking myself oh god you know i'm i'm i'm i'm looking at my watching i'm thinking i want to get to public said i want to have to slip all of it out of a dixie i got no dog food for this morning now i'm a sudden before even look up it's five to five i'm sitting there preparing myself uh g well indexie's open twenty four hours done here at nab hill because i'm going to be here forever we're going to have overtime again we're doing we have overtime no because i look at my watch i look up again oh now it's six to five calarado i looked down again i'm i watched now it's seven to five and a moment that the seven school went in with a minute and a half to go my a shot up out of that chair like i had been shot by a cannonball so go to public's we get home and i turn on the tv wanting a course to find out the only thing at this point i want to find out i know what a disaster was i don't need any embellishment from guys who don't know what they're talking about want to find out the extent of popbell breeze injury is there any hope is you're going to be back soon with the serious doing the anything about it so i turn the channel four and there's that asshole Jim burry and god is he an asshole and what's the and and these two episodes are the epitome again every day like i said before it proves to me that what i say about this town is right on target bush league we had one professional team and i don't care whether hotie is in his popular is this or that's not the point it's a professional sport one protein play last night in a monumental game of cataclysmic proportions by the way it turned out unbelievable story that started out on phenomenally well where you're four contemporary with the three goals with the natural hadric the third one are shot that nobody in the world would even try except him just uh... unbelievable were on top of the world and go from this on wheel unbelievable you for experience to the frapper in just a matter of minutes watching a team collapsed a gutless choking performance the likes of which we've seldom seen and what's the lead story on the sports on channel four all the hurricanes are going to find out that there are opponents going to be in the NCAA basketball see i hate to break the news and i like letter hamilton i met him at the airport he came up to meet my mian national several months ago i was waiting for a plane he's in a good guy doing a super job over there the problem is other than that phony thing they had with a shell out for the kinetic game at the mimey arena they don't draw flies in fact while Jim burry is doing the story and the gackies on their doing his usual uh... here's the gackies stock so carry exactly there's shown some file footage in the background of the hurricanes blown away some opponent in the mimey arena and all you see it back is all these empty seats there's nobody there because nobody cares which is said but the truth of the matter is nobody cares and not only did they tell us that they're playing George sun but now we got to see the highlights of all the other entity double a games from yesterday now we finally get to the panther game and that disastrous collapse in the third period is there even a mention by Jim burry that pavel burry didn't play in the third period no is there anything about his injury no so i'm nauseated i want to puk now i turn over to channel 10 because they do that extra five minutes to get in more commercials you know they they end the thing eleven thirty five before nightline comes on so sure enough just in time eleven thirty here's the sports with Jimmy syphilis up in the europe outside madden square garden now this is the best here's Jimmy syphilis standing in the pouring rain now they really think that this is going to butcher his image and there's nobody's like standing with an umbrella over his head like they do and any other television station in the universe you know you see these reporters out there they try to make it seem like they're really you know doing something heroic he's out there in a rainstorm in the europe with no umbrella and the rain is puk and you know he still up and you know so he goes on what does Jimmy syphilis watch channel 10 lead with all the hurricane basketball team of same same crap exactly carbon copy what we saw in channel four and the sad truth of it is nobody cares about hurricane basketball said they're having a great year Leonard Hamilton's a wonderful guy nobody cares now we get to the panther game and i'm waiting in Jimmy syphilis gives a look in the smear we see a couple of goals popl-boreed to this and bobbabond isn't that and then they fell apart and call a lot of we see all Peter forzberg with a hatrick that's it any information there no no i'm following it them out so i turn on the small dish and go to espn nothing there go to espn uh uh news station nothing there then i go to the doos and loa beholder basketball games ending with five seconds left stay tuned for hockey night tonight eleven thirty five that's the wrap up show they have on the doos so i have to watch espn two which they did a great job of giving the up-to-date information about he re-introduced the knee and as much as information is would have been available last night but on the local channels do we get any information no very and Jimmy syphilis i hope the two of you eat low okay you both suck you're both the epitome of this bush leg town it's eleven twig what is it two twenty five to you let's get out of here it works the lotion in the basket you a young man turns twenty eight is Gordon's weed is bag i'll tell the next day it's too many seeds in your dime bag getting through the party two minutes too late isn't it the chronic don't you think it's not great when you come out from break the free bag when you're already big you're really good that's you just did it you say who are you you get hot brownie that you already ate a new dawn next time a lot of the two it's like 10,000 joints when all you need is a bite it's like having to feel a pitch and then finding out with our 10-th of life and here's a new to the chronic don't you think yeah a little too much chronic yeah really do things it's not great when you come out from break the free bag when you're already big you're always with that's you just did it you say who won the stock you get 34,56, WKOM and of course we have a lot of experts out there in radio land including in the macaroon before the game there's some of these abosos walking around and coming up to me oh yeah I see were all planted I he's going to really kick some ass and I will say this during that part of the game when everything was going great and it was so exciting and you foric I'm trying to watch it objectively and I'm thinking yeah he is skating a lot better when he's handing the puck better and he's playing better and I can almost actually tolerate him but then after Adam foot picked up Pavel Buray late in the first period in the slamden down on the ice and you wonder okay where's the enforcer where is this guy who that's the reason he's supposed to be out there is to protect the superstars the little guys like Buray and Whitney and so on where is he is he involved in any way shape performed did he ever get involved in any way shape performed just straight in the rasa and then as the game progressed you saw it as soon as Buray left that game late in the second period you saw a bunch of guys turn into whiffs and you watch kai out just a question if who wants it to worse that's what it was all about did these guys want it not in the least bit not in the least bit but as soon as Colorado sniffed the notion that they might have a chance to get back in the game here they're walking right in there forksberg walking right in hey Duke walking right in Joe Sackick just what dead marsh walking right in on goal right to the edge of the crease they're walking and untouched by human hands sticks or anything else I've never seen anything so disgusting in my life just uh if someone would have told you even remembering that odd of again that we blew a four goal lead in the game and thanks to Whitney won up playing six to five late in the game that was a hell of a game only because we want a winning after blowing a big lead but blowing a five goal lead late in the second period that's the first time by the way in eight years that's happened in the entire league the biggest blow job in NHL in eight years unbelievable six goals in the third period and we got guys on here on this station blaming Sean Burk he had one bad goal there the one that got lost in the speed he didn't know where it was but at that point can you blame the guy he's lost he's out there it would be like having having a hockey game where you got five skaters in a goal and the other end they just got a goal you know but he else okay go down here and see that's basically what the third period was I have never seen anything like it in my life gotless spyingless cissy space actually ready for prime time that kid is a defenseman like my look we could put my miniature pinch about there and scared a guy's off better than cissy space that tragic sad but somehow we'll survive we'll overcome but I think what you saw that it was it was cataclysmic because color by the army of the keralina wins again again their eight points ahead the only way and people that were talking about you know if they win the division they got a chance for the number three seed are they got a win the division the path is not a chime in chance and hell and with keralina coming in here on Saturday for what's going to be the biggest game of the year at that point with no pop out debris are we is our hope side no I think you're going to see I hate to say this but so we have to deal about it barring some miracle I think you're going to see this team go right in the tank now from that point that was the dead now what you saw last night the collapse of cataclysmic proportions hey but the hurricanes are playing Georgetown only only in this town only in this town do these things happen and they you know we were having such a good time they got the sound straight out of the arena and I school and they're guys they got the out of plant town scores doing a great job with that I mean right up to date I scorn guys see when you do something good I'll tell you about it can we see the red light but then somebody told me in the air can't at the center in Toronto you can't see what lights up there either or they've only been playing hockey for five thousand years so maybe you know maybe it's black and disease it's going around like my rash who knows here's a mobile in western hello mobile in western mobile in western it's been waiting 33 minutes in 27 seconds tell us yes if you're just a lot okay you don't get a

embarrassed yeah okay Andy from Hollywood okay one call after the board soon as I saw it's in Hollywood I know exactly who was gonna be that's a medley of our hockey fan right there that's that's the beginning of the conversation about last night by the way there's a big article Dave Joseph and the son said let's morning about the metaphors and about the how they're not even playing any arena anymore which I was nowhere did you know that their crowds and I used the word loosely are so tiny that the metaphors and I feel bad for about Snyder because he made a big you know an effort he made a commitment there metaphors on thin ice keep sliding away they're now playing oh let's see where the hell are they playing uh I don't get it they play in the afternoon at a public rank because they can no longer take the financial hit of playing in their home building on a weeknight the game starts 20 minutes late because they lack a league required physician despite free admission approximately 80 hour attendance for the opening face up of Wednesday's East Coast hockey league game number 745 the metaphors against the PD pride this is a hockey town 80 people they're playing like in you know on a

guys here's a mobile and western hello hey it's me again you know i woke up this morning i looked in my wife i said i mean i just had the worst nightmare in the world i dreamt we went to the game last night we were outside nothing i wound up losing seven to five when she told me that it was true and there wasn't a nightmare i had to call and set to work aside it was i've been watching you have to work i i'm sick of my stomach you know i mean like you just said it's been nine years since the team is blown up five gold weed i've been watching hockey season today so that the h a right and and and and all my years i've never seen the one and that is well and a lead but the idea of the first almost the whole first two periods were so one so wonderful and so exciting and burry has got to electrifying everybody and then he gets re injured because you know everybody standing around watching on white him getting mold of my end of foot and everybody else is standing around not protecting see that's the problem with too many these guys on this team they have no there's no inspiration you can see in the way they play the lackluster they're just going around when he's out there they play with more motivation but the moment that he was gone it was like a bunch of ten-year-old kids stepped on the ice and i mean log gardener that fight for the end of you know wrong guy no i don't accomplish a lot yeah well basically forced you know yeah well i'll just came again last night i then i looked in my wife and was about five to three i said you know if they blow this game it could be the end of the season this game saturday really is the maker right man it's it's the whole season right there you grow that game you know the mantra all those nasty boxing those fast yeah everybody creeping up Montreal is how does the pistol now you have just one point behind uh boss and you're even a lose last night is not only two points ahead but they got several more wins so they got the edge there the range I got to put up Washington is creeping up i'm telling the chances of this team making a playoff especially if burry is out for any just stay in period of time no you can talk about the door and it's just un i i just i don't know what's the i and sick to my stomach yeah yeah i don't know i don't even have the strength to say it but i'll try he shoot with course take two in callos in the way okay we have an open line in brown all three and day we're waiting for all those big defense that were out there you know so now i understand why they were talking about you and basketball even though nobody cares about that is there are fewer people care about this as in none who are those nineteen thousand people socializing there last night is anybody know five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the mobile one line this is truly unbelievable it is here's a mobile in boington beach hello yeah yes sir i am so disgusted with this game last night i know it's a go there i'll tell you one thing they have only two leaders they have a not team is burry is a sorrelly and that's it and only time they get the games only time they play hard otherwise as they collapse but you said they have no leadership you're like in the coach you're hard to lead when you're sitting up in the stands in a suit like dino is all the time you have to get some of them they have to go out get some leaders on the ice there were to freaking me to my yeah yeah you need a mile and so so i'm so sick tired of the apologists for rob need of my rent is town this has been going on it's the sixty year now and the organization has got high hopes in it and two years ago it was BM said oh well he's gonna have to step up and then last year at the beginning of the year well this

fourth show yeah yeah yeah only come back yes yes what asshole yes what this is the same guy that called yesterday gold he's gonna kick my butt how do you like to uh same guy that called his show yes it's not a sports show no it's the knee a rod show and he'll talk to all whatever he wants to talk about and if you think i'm going to get sucked into a can drive controversy because they're so desperate i've got the rail in town they're broadcasting out there they got the nc double a's they got that panther cataclysmic lost last night they got all these sports things going on and they're so desperate on that show that guilty things you got to suck me into a big can drive controversy and Greg Reed comes down here yesterday morning oh that was great radio and i looked at him like are you nuts and he says that was great radio let me see it again there is nobody i know in this market in his business who's been on here more than 30 seconds we even understand why that puts us on here nobody and i'm gonna waste my time like he's on here he's he's gonna have to fight out of how come near rogers what are my qualifications what are Hank's qualifications like i'm gonna waste my time with him by the way the trends will be out of four o'clock this afternoon y'all they let's see who does better into the arbitrarian trends when it come out for the satin okay sweet art let's use got the numbers and i don't have two other guys to suck along with me on the show here there every day okay let's you do an a step of all eight other lemons to run around just roger me just a two of us in here and that's it and somehow we still manage the funbular way along here's a mobile in kendel hello hello me oh yes sir yes enjoy the show listen the reason i'm calling i've been listening to the uh i'm saying good and we're big hockey fans up there right baseball fans and i've always been the type of guy that follows the team no matter how they're doing but i've been listening to the amstation here for a last year and one thing i've noticed i wish we we have no fans here no we don't but at the same time we don't have a product that you can believe in uh there's no backing to it with the exception of the the dolphins we're spending a little bit of money keep in mind the dolphins have been here for a long long time so the dolphin the dolphins are firmly entrenched that's a whole different ball game right right and the other thing i realized you and Hank do an excellent job because it takes a little talent to talk on a radio keep the audience captivated uh that i could i listen to Jim role the other night just by accident yeah and the man it sounds like rush limbo i don't think one subject to repeat it over and over and over and then you can try controversy very he's really weak but i think you're doing a great job i enjoyed listening and keep up to good work and thank you so much thanks for the question thank you okay we have two open lines and borrowed one day too they're not capable of discussing that game last night they don't understand it how how is that possible there were 19,000 people there last night every day in one of my scene a hallway come up the aisle hey Neil i you don't would love your show but we just have nothing to say no matter it's like when we got paville buray and i told you this guy is the greatest i don't care what anybody says he is the greatest athlete in the world today in terms of excitement in terms of being able to do things that nobody else can do i know yarmor yarmor yarmor is great he's got all those points he's sensational he's a lot bigger he's a lot stronger but in terms of the most exciting athlete in any sport in the world we got him right here right now and he's proven that to us what has he got 12 13 goals in the 11 games of the and a unbelievable numbers unbelievable performance every time he's out there watching that short-handed breakaway goal last night was enough to make goosebumps on your uh back home in other parts where we can't even mention on a year and these people still don't get it just like day shows have said nothing about the matter doors by the way it's incredible ice where they have to play their games now and that's a skating rink that's what they have to play their games in front of eighty people now because that's how much of a hockey town this is and like he says the first home game we had with paville buray they had trouble selling the game out here because they didn't know who and I had no idea who the hell he was and again part of the reason being the people in the media the gym varies the gym is set to those and some of the people on this station because they don't know anything about it they're not interested in it oh well you know that's uh we don't care about that we'd rather hear about golf because there's a lot more people play golf and watch golf golf is for pussy's okay let me check no seriously with all of the respect to the deraille and the people out there and I know we have to get involved in all these cluster folks that go on golf is for pussy's hockey is for real men like me golf is for pussy's for real original number one pan-bees and anybody that's a big golf end that watches other guys hit balls you know you know what they call that one guys hang around don't you watch other guys hitting balls I think everybody knows that that's a game club you moron 1056 at 560 QIM where you fudge back him there to Miami cops with a hot newbie there are the streets fighting cry they pop at the hand against me there yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah hell and they'll buy we get problems the creating six balls and that's a group of senior citizens who went around trying to get the early bird special after seven yeah let's go get him yeah that was not played up this tree hey lady you can't cross the area you'll have to cross the line there they're determined the plaintiff this must be in the middle all right just tear your under a red oh so now you're an interesting my wife what's the charm there's an outer I'm gonna first uh let's see that white stuff yeah I just thought you got over a hundred bags in here oh for sweet and low my restaurant you just came out of second man yeah there it comes in Miami comes on newbie in L.M.dale by repairing this ball on L.B.Z it's a lot of no to it five 62 I'm so anyway somebody the reason I played that somebody was kind enough to send me the February 25th issue of the hell and they'll die Jess boy and on the front page it's an article the lone ranger arrives can public relations wizard bill loan creating new image for the city of hell and they'll have acts no and it goes down about the wizard who guided the revival of sunny hours beaches waiting for a signed contract from the city hell and they'll so it can roll up his sleeves and work his magic here oh and it goes on to say the image of hell and Dale was dealt a major setback in the late 1980s when popular radio tacos Neil Rogers mocked the city as a sweet and low early bird dining crowd which was aired on radio for seven years oh so I made that up right hell and Dale never recovered from the negative image portrayed by Neil Rogers as hell and Dale city commissioner is rarely initiated any game plan to create a pro growth attitude in the city so I take tremendous credit for the fact that it's still all all parts in hell and Dale and sunny rose and bird and RJ intendola and the outhairs game they're all still rotting and it's still all okay we can thank Neil Rogers for that and only the hell and Dale by Jess would dare to give me credit for thank you so much here's a candle hello any other go on okay sir we're going to call you before about the pantersking last night I'm really well game but basically speechless that nothing to say about it I wanted to ask you a couple things on the game and see what you thought about him first off after it's five three or maybe five four but once five three what isn't Terry Murray called a timeout get his players to the bench and you know try and figure something out you know Terry Murray was like a frozen object suspended animation standing there like he usually is his hand on his head and his hand barely even moving barely even moving you're right why wasn't there a timeout of the critical point when this team was just folding up like an accordion and get these guys together and give them a breather and say listen we still got to leave here cut the crap let's worry only about defense and and instead of that nothing he just did their helpless Terry Murray has shown me like I've said over and over again nothing other than the fact he's a hard ass it doesn't rob leader marah this is uh in two games he's costed a three gold yeah one standing in the crease in Toronto right one in the crease in a last night and then the penalty you beg him even the powerfully no right you know I'd love to see him is this the last year in the contract? I don't think so no no I think they they're gonna make a deal for uh for another forward a distance before the a trading deadline they have to get a defense then you know Murphy's out the lineup and boi tell you without him in there last night these guys I that little the last ten minutes of that game watching guys just skitty right into the edge of the crease untouched and then when for spurscore that last school I just couldn't believe in other wood uh he he just is big enough and strong enough and had the determination and will but nobody was gonna stop him our people just didn't care enough to make the effort that was the problem I mean I was the same wanted it and these guys didn't in a state of shock with the rest of the people I mean you never see that I mean it never happened five but it never could cross your mind how do you do it you can I mean I'm just sitting there how yeah you know how I think maybe they brought that other guy up uh lava boy it's a you know maybe you know shopman run the league I don't know he play I thought he played good with sia but that looks really good as I line with bray and uh and whoever the hell also is on the line with me yeah and then on top of all things look he gets injured again but I mean you know the phobias plan to well put on your yama curse you're let's say a prayer I have a good one and god bless you let's say a brocha today okay for the panthers for five out let's heal him up real quick again yeah the enforcer he's gonna go out there that big black guy named Peter he's gonna go out there and show him a thing or two alright just one I thought just one I thought I could start buying into his whole act and he does nothing oh and so little too late now by the way sweetheart open line in date five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T one of the slide here's Miami hello Amy what's up yes sir how's that a how's that rationing by the way it's there you know has it been you think it's been over seven weeks now yeah because um generally I think any like dermisological disorder in the skin takes about seven weeks to clear up but um regardless I call the yesterday I don't know if it's okay to even message or not um you might want to try hydrocord is own one percent ointment forget that that's that's uh don't you think I'm going to determine challenges oh yeah no I'll kind of have you do these stuff no luck but I am supposed to fight out about my biopsy whatever the hell it was I'm holding my breath because you know how much faith I have in doctors okay come on doctor Stanley that is supposed to be the big day I got a nice uh a nice scab on my neck now teeling up very nicely from where they took the big plug out of my neck I think we're gonna put in the middle of my forehead like frankendstein open line a date one in Broward 560 and 560 under 182 wireless line here's Boka hello yeah Neil yes sir why are you always knocking on me and Brian Murray there you go there we go again asshole Mitch see we already had Andy we have asshole Mitch not talking about what we saw last like just the same oh like most of the people in this town the same old tired garbage can't have an intelligence conversation have no insight no comment on how could anybody forget about being a hockey fan a sports fan how could anybody even be there last night we even see it on television or just smell it in the air I mean you can smell a sense of calm and all like man is would say all over this town and not have something to say it referenced through what happened as opposed to the same old stale maybe that's what the smell is the same old tired so crap from the same old tired guys this is what the death of talk waiting I was saying a George during the break the idea of a sports talk station in this market would be like having a Ukrainian music station in Anchorage Alaska it would be like playing Chinese melodies in Rio de Janeiro on a radio that's how laughable how ludicrous it is this is the sports town this isn't the real place this is a reyenta place this is the land of the loft this is a bunch of goddamn bedroom towns one after another after another none of which mean anything a bunch of little feet to the spice thems oh you can't put up any neon signs and you can't put up a satellite it just a bunch of little meaningless people who want to be important like some of the people upstairs here trying to push everybody around and screw up your goddamn life that's what this place is there's no substance the only substance like I said you can smell it it's in the ear open up the window man close it real fast roll it down because you can smell it oh god that's that's what it's all about and like I said when I came on here this morning and I you know not that it makes me feel any better but it just kind of reinforces what I say all the time there's just nothing here baby nothing here we got you know the sunshine palm trees water a lot of great golf courses don't forget to handcook beyond from the round to a clock well these guys they like golf you know they like golf because we're out there at the round what was that remember that old farts tournament they were at a couple of weeks ago were they were pushing the guys around in not just in golf carts in wheelchairs the geriatric calendar golf tournament with sunny rosin hey thanks to how many or fuckers over this performance my back is like a symbol and my nuts are like those I don't even have enough to fact us were I tried secret lotion that's it not love G but it's don't get no bigger than a go see there's nothing I can do alright I only got a three inch two oh you'll be disappointed when we reach by how but you won't know for sure if I'm a man or a mouse you know big Mac or like a happy meal you can watch that in seconds from your high heels your square I was in the pool so I only got a three inch two you call that a secret time time that I wonder if it will ever grow if I was a homosexual I couldn't even push in your pool it looks like Mr. Peanut with other things it got capillaries instead of things I could the circulation with a piggy ring for Halloween I'd rather like up a low wing it's in a suction tube because I only got a three inch two even with a metric rule I only got a three inch to tell them die it's 116 at 560 WQ I'm happy Thursday to hear tomorrow we got the Marlon Jean Marlins and Tampa Bay devil rays the devil a r number when they first got the franchise over there and all the right wingers were having to respect down over the West Coast oh the devil rays that's a 10 if we can't have that name yeah and they all said tough crap yeah here's Miami Beach hello and they don't of course look what happened lightning after the name the baseball team the devil rays maybe they're getting punished by God yes sir I want to remind you of a game in the early 90s the bottom goes when it's maybe cartons they had a five nothing leader in the third period yeah or it's a straight you remember that game no oh that was gonna came and also I was reading what does that have to do with anything well what do we care about that sure why at least could use the goals in the third period last night that's sure that having Curtis Joseph turning to a human siv after give up the first one that has your question I was reading the Toronto paper and they were saying that maybe leaves should make a deal at the deadline I think they shouldn't what do you think they could deal for one to get a score to get a score yeah that's going to have about five or six twenty goals scores what are they another score for anything it's another defenseman that's score that's what I was only one of the no I don't know I need to pick good luck in Saint Louis tonight tell that this one bad we need this one bad well you know Koo Joey's got his moments we have an open on who the hell is that I'm not gonna tell you to want to know who that is open line in date five six seven oh five sixty it's hockey talk again all right so watch we don't know anything about that we don't care of course not that's why listen to this station here's my amy hello all I got to say is two words coach McClean he's got to say two words coach McClean by the way how's Marty struck at that interview to shorter last night after he scored his 30th goal the coach McClean wouldn't play because he wasn't good enough for coach McClean and I would make the difference coach McClean he's part of the reason we got the source that we got today is coach McClancer but at any rate here's a mobile in crowsprings hello yes sir last night we're sitting there the fruit period 17 seconds it came out shoot from inside the blue line oh why don't you yes and I turn everybody's you know what I got the feeling I'm on until I got to be five to three I never believed in my worst night mirrors that it was possible to blow that game except for one thing and I want you to think back all year I like work you much of an act but as soon as he gets too goal he turns into a stem he gets real empty I'm telling you watch absolutely sure I want to tell you something with all the respect any gully in the world including dominant cashew to best ones who've ever played listen let me see what I think that's not a defense in front of him sir but any semblance of support when you are totally abandoned by the entire team when they're letting guys skate and almost come from the blue line there isn't anybody that's not going to cave in there is nothing there is nothing Sean Burke could have done last night they would have protected him. I agree however however we're a team and like we're looking at we're looking down there and I say where's Barry right after that we're burning yeah there's no burn on the bench yeah yeah that whole team if white is the only one got wrong on that team to fight it take the lesson I off well what is that to it the tell me that we need to change in the in coaches and we need to get rid of what me and my I say I like the pack is new myer and molar and stata for a yarmory auger okay I'll go for okay we have an open line to a mid-brower five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT and T wireless line here's Morton Beach hello yeah how are you doing okay sir yeah last night I think you know burrow going out that definitely have something to do with it but once I found out that bitch was in the arena they'd thank like the Titanic once they found out what that bitch was in the arena the lean beyond they thank like yeah that added on it you're right I forgot about that I've trying to forget that she was there they put her up on the screen and I was yeah I told that they have to do that to us I think she might have talked to the minute you know what is there right oh yeah they're all given a big old vision and the organist starts playing that awful song and you know Jesus Christ at the beginning of the end I never thought about that yeah she must have been talking to them in between periods and between the second third pathetic yeah it was talking bitch it made me sick center back to Canada you got that right Canadian okay thanks a lot at good point there's the guy that's got the answer that's freaking nestling Dion was in their last night couldn't sing her way out of a paper sack talk about oh and by the way getting back to our music thing so coming to work this morning and I'm listening to music of course and I decided there there is no such thing as right and wrong there's no there's no answer because these people were talking about sing different kinds of music you can't compare beach boys music with aerosmith with Marvin Gay all three of the marked totally different genres of music you can't so I comparing apples with come quotes you can't do it so each in their own category whatever that might be whatever you want to pigeon olin but when somebody calls here and says to me about the rolling stones and aerosmith I mean granted the stones are going to have the concert tomorrow night some old guys who want to feel like their teenagers are going to go see that stale tired old act and make Jagger who can't hit a true note if his life depended on the name or and that's fine you know if that's what turns you on if that was what cranks you chain but to compare them the aerosmith and I don't care who came first to chicken to the egg that's not the point in addition to which you were saying all day yesterday when you know what are their earlier stuff that's what I like if it's but it's not like they stopped recording like the beach boys ten or fifteen years ago I like their earlier stuff better much better but a lot of the stuff I was playing yesterday was was stuff that's just been recorded in the last few years and it's great it's still good it's okay but it's not like the earlier stuff okay I just agree I think most of the stuff I was telling you to be like crying oh just unbelievable stuff dude looks like a lady but I do have all the older stuff here too if I let's play aerosmith the rest of the day man remont sweet emotion walk this way oh don't walk that way don't walk that way you know what they'll start saying you know I'm looking at the box score because I was just like most of the people over there last night so mesmerized and just grossed out by what was going on I wasn't keeping track of time that this was all unfolding third period okay it's five to two with that early lamu go on the power play then at seven fifteen it's five three and then it's still keep in mind it's still five to three and of course that was all after the this allowed go thanks to Robbie and the crease 15 minute mark on the power play dead marsh from four's broken second now it's five to four with five minutes left brewery from podium and donovan 1541 41 second later now it's five five they do it from second can four's broken 1740 a little under two minutes later and then four's worked for the hatrick 1829 about twenty or forty nine seconds later for number seven as they just kept skating right in barreling right in true people around people and on touch I'm gonna tell you something you guys are out there playing last night and I'll set off list of this show you were disgraced that performance is a well I have never seen a group of people just cave in and give up just because one guy got hurt again I realized he's the main guy but like I've been trying to tell you look at the standing it's been a five hundred team just about all year long it's a mediocre team that can rise to tremendous heights when you've got a superstar like brewery plant but without him mediocre at best and thanks to my grueso and David J. sparks are all these other puppets they got in the media they keep trying to sell us all the youngsters in the organization we've been here in his craft for six years now first six years and there isn't any one of the youngsters in the organization that's turned into a star player not one here's a curl spring solo yes sir let's say I'm called a love you chef yes you think you have a money to some from you no two opera lines in brown or five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line here's an adventure hello good afternoon sir yes sir good evening first of all happy poem huh um two positive things out of the game last night and what could those possibly a binser I think uh boy I'll have a very good game I think he'd knocked a will me you down and that's the only reason why kavashikata go yeah boy look good to me yeah and we've looked real good these two kids but in the meantime what does that have to do with a price of rice that's true um well then I won't even talk about any positive things well think it's how how how how how can you find a positive I mean I know you've got blinders on how can you find I mean even the most eternal optimist in the history mankind how could you find blinders in a game where you blow a lead like that and your super star player the great white hope re-inders is knee again and got only knows when it'll come back how could you find anything positive out of that except we got all of their alive okay well i was just looking if you i don't know i don't know no way on the negativity like everybody else i think no it's not a no it's not a no it's not a it's not a question being negative and you're questioning honest and i'm gonna tell you i stayed until the seventh uh Colorado goal and we bolted out of there and the people screaming as they walked out of there i have never seen a reaction in my life i mean these people were pissed off and fired up baby they were psychotic well you didn't have to sit next to Andy like i do oh well they're lucky okay give him a big kiss honey honey like that he now is not only calling himself he's got his boyfriend calling see just keep listening folks if you have any doubts at what i say about this town is true just keep listening not just in this show all he shows because all of these creatures out there you'll hear them all over the god damn place repeating all of these things all of a were an over and over again till they're coming out your ears and maybe even your back i mean it's just unbelievable it's a cluster fork did not hit it that before kind of new to its sports it's got a new would be in a fan it's got to do it's a little cluster fork when they're little buddies oh god no in back Little authentic Little darling Hooray Ha-Hey Oyou Call Moron Get out I'm not a fan of the Black Knight, but we're on the other side. That's the second one. I don't know if it's just turned out we just heard during the break of room of their circulating. They're giving free weed to everybody who shows up at the rail out there this afternoon. Yeah, it's maybe it'll spice it up a little bit. I think you gotta be stolen to a watch call function. You have to be stolen, or just board the tears. Well if he weren't before you started watching, here's the Fort Myers. Hello. All right, Neil. Yes, sir. I got to work today after tomorrow. You guys ought to get some kind of a machine that tells you when people are calling out of the area could. Anyway, I want to just start fighting. I want to start by just agreeing with you on your dime. Is that what this is? On on. Yeah, so I'm like, don't get on. I'm too cheap to get a toll free line for you folks. Oh, there. I want you to know that. It's a business. I want you to start by disagreeing with you by I heard you start to plan or Curtis Joseph. I watched him last year. I started to paint land or Curtis Joseph. Yeah. Oh, I did what I say that last night. He had a bad game and he did. Okay. I hate to get why I want him to highlight. I watched him send Colorado packing last year. I love Curtis Joseph. Yeah, I'm wondering if you'd like to. Did let me ask you, did he ever have a bad game? Yeah, he's had a bad game. Even if you had a bad game, you got to watch it to say as soon as they signed them, I knew they were going to win their division. I don't know the names of the new division. Anyway, I don't live here in the South Florida. Are the least in first place in their division, sir? Yeah, aren't they? No, no. Now, auto was in first place by three points. You wait to the playoffs. Yeah, I'm going to get right there from your, from your mouth to Harold Ballard. Right, okay? Okay, you got the man between the pipes. Okay. We'll see what happens when the playoffs come again. Anyway, I want to say, you know what you need to play. I'll see what you need to need. I need defense. That's the least problem. They have no defense. They've got all the problems in Florida. I know defense. And I can't there's less than no defense. I've never called a talk radio show. I've never to less. And I did because of this loss. I tried to enjoy the path. He didn't do you see. He didn't do you see. He didn't. Sir, are you listening to anything I'm saying? Yeah. So go to the conversation. I know you're spending a lot of money and I appreciate that. But I'd like to have some verbal interchange. Did you see the game last night? Do they do? No, I did. I wanted to ask you about that. Well, you're lucky. You're lucky. You'd be in the hospital right now if you'd assume it. Okay, well, what I want to do is I can't. You're not a sports program. I listened to you in the morning. I enjoy your songs a lot. Yeah. The three inch records that you just played there. There, there. There. There. The three inch record I just played. The ten inch record. Anyway, talk to me about not protecting your stars. If you're all going to get some stars in the state, you got, and somebody wasn't protecting the man. Okay, we got to win out of here. That worries more than a lot. Okay, let's get up. Okay. How was he talking about, huh? We're looking at him. He's having an inch of. Fucking nice. Oh, I do like to miss you better at this point. Trust me. Yeah, I'm not. I'm not. Ow. Next slide, please. You made a surprise about mine. Which by the way, so last night I get my take on because they're promuling that Schneide Twain Special on CBS last night at 8 o'clock. That was the tape down here at Miami with Alton John and the back street voice. And I look on a big dish and sure enough, there's a G, whatever that will have to set like is GE124, the National CBS affiliate. It's on there. So I start my machine rolling and I come home and there's a blank screen. 745 for some reason to just went out. So that letter I got from stupid star connection. It's not there fault by the way. QA souls at Channel 4. I hope somebody over there gets a goddamn hammer on it. Okay, I hope you have pop a big one. Anxels, you deserve Jim Burry. And match made in him and Andrew's a Gakie. That's right. I hope that Jim Burry looks with. Here's a Gakie. Yeah. What a pile of crap. Oh, well, we got to write to the, you know, FCC, we got to stop you people from getting your out of town network affiliates. Jack asked, what was enabled to tape that? You know that's Shania Twain. They hit around the last night as they were scouring for some information about pop L. Burry. She said that before every comment, now do you like Shania Twain, by the way? She looks good. Do you like her music? No, we have to start with this again. No, I don't. Okay, well, the reason you don't like her music is because every coming for every concert now or before she goes and concert, she listens to the back street voice. She said, well, there you go. I thought I wouldn't make you feel better. You have no taste. Here's a lady in North Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Hello. Yes. Neil? Yes. Hi, honey. Hello. Hello. I need your help very much. Sounds like it. Remember? Are you hungry? Please. I remember when we had the ration, the age is so important they found a was up. Oh. What the hell did it? It was a blood. I'm just... No, they didn't find anything. I still have it. I'm getting the results of my biopsy today. I have no idea what it is. It's still there. You think you got as a hole in my neck now where they've punched a pull a bunch of skin out? Well, that's what they're doing to my granddaughter. Yeah. Did you send me this back? Is this Michelle? No, this is a... Wee. Oh, because Michelle sent me a long fact in Jesus and right now she said after 1130 she'll be by the radio. So it's the time that you brought this up. It must be on a psychic wavelength with Michelle. What kind of a doctor do you go to? He's Jewish. You know what I mean? She went to an allergic... I have been, I've been to a doctor feel good with a funny nose over my baby. She says you don't need me so I'm not going to go there anymore. I went to the Cleveland Clinic where they're supposed to know what they're doing to a doctor who says, oh, it was the Adelaide you were taking trying to the drug. It wasn't the Adelaide. And now I go to my dermatologist friend Stanley over there at the Center for Dermatology in Hollywood. Hopefully we'll find some of them out today. I pray. She went to the dermatologist of so many of them and the allergies. They give her all the same thing. Here, take this pill. Take that pill. Yeah, and nothing happened. Nothing happened. Right. Oh, guys. Nothing happened with you either. No, you're not. You're not. You're not. You're not. No, somebody said, well, Greg Reed, our boss came down here and somebody said there's a fungus among us and I said, yeah, that was the fungus. That was the only fungus. Okay. Thank you so much. Good luck. Yeah, please do. Okay. A lot of people out there with a lot of rashes that I could city. I don't want to make any ranch judgments about them, but someday somehow. In fact, I'm going to have you call because he'll be, you know, want to climb today and you said he'd have some. It was at the hockey game last night, but he kind of like looked down at me and like appointed it as neck like how is it? And I like, you know, little, a little 10 seconds of comedy. And that was it. See, this is the problem. Nobody takes these things seriously. It's not their body. You know, it's Stanley's a good guy. He's a big fan. He's probably real depressed today because he was at the game right to Lee and too, but, you know, and he's from Toronto. She can't be all bad. But I'd like to have something some ideas, some answers. I mean, after a while, it gets a little bit older than if it were just a rash, I don't care when you look as bad as I do, do I give a crap about having a rash, I'll little rash on your neck that you can barely see. No. But when it's all the other, you know, the pain in the neck and the this and then the little kind of like a non-specific stuff. You know what I'm talking about? It's a whole series of annoying things and nobody seems to understand what the hell it's all about. All of these things. Then you'd like to a get rid of it for a change. Hello, Dr. Can you give me an answer to anything? No. Thank you. Oh, by the way, who's the bill? Two open lines in date, County, 560, 505, 60, I feel a lot better today because it's almost noon and I realize that most of the people in this town aren't the least but concerned about that game last night or the re-entry of Palm Elbury. They still most of them have no idea who he isn't couldn't care less. So I feel better now because I thought it was kind of like a devastating experience and now I realize it means nothing. I feel better. I really do. This is the Neil Roger show. This is your brain. Any question? Some stations give you tickets. Some stations give you car. But this station is the only station that gives you magical power because this station is going to render you invisible. Invisible. So what you want? Do what you want to do. No one will ever know because you're invisible. Cannot be seen in the world of positivity. You can go to school. Make it. Make it. Go to work. Make it. The other people. Make it. Oh, because you're invisible. Just feel it setting this weekend. And when you hear a bit sour, the tense comment. And you'll be on your way to invisibility. This station is exempt from responsibility for your actions while you are invisible. Employees of this station and the families are not eligible to be invisible. For naked ever. Partie. Is a vote. Partie. People listening for your chance to win. It's 145 at 5. 50 WQM. Here's a fact that says, did you please possibly since you're so beacuse intensive this week. Play a beacuse for dedication for gilding. What I brought to be continued. To be continued. Anyway, I get a card in the mail this morning. I'm telling you the mail this week has been spectacular. Then between the faxes in the mail. And here's a card. Another one of those Easter cards. Oh, I always love people who know that you don't celebrate their holidays. But they're still insist on, you know, imposing. See, that's the religion is they're all the same. It's just a matter of degree. The more intolerant they are, the more they eat this crap on you. And he's got his clip and article from the Palm Beach post. This is about the guy the skywriting guy. We got the thing yesterday. Love is in the year over Boko. Pilots spreads. God's word. 9,000 feet up. And he's writing all these things. Love God. God problems. Pray on deck for Easter. He is risen. Yadi. Yadi. So they asked this. Your poor Jerry Stevens in Boko. How old soon is he coming back? And he says, very soon. I don't have the exact date. So that's two years he says. So based on this article, I get this Easter card written note from another Jerry in Boko, who says, Neil, you have only two years left to make your decision. It closed is the clipping from the post to help you arrive at that decision. Surely you must believe in something, Neil. No. Why not God? No. I suspect you may be one of those who believe in reincarnation. No. No. Don't fall for that. You think God is so cruel. He would subject his creation to come back again and again. Yes. What a terrible faith. Think about these things I said, Neil. All you have to do is accept it. It's a free gift eternal life. No. Refusing this free gift will land you and hell. God bless you. It's a free gift. You don't think that God would subject you to come back again and again and know memory of the previous life. It's meaningless anyway. But now you have this free gift of going to heaven. Otherwise you'll land in the hell. Stop them think about it, Jerry. about that loving God. If you want to come out in time squared night, you know, on the Yale, and it's big assign to gotten time squared, making an announcement, maybe then I'll listen. Otherwise, big counties open 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T wireless line. Here's a mobile in the West Palm Beach, Chillow. I do it. Okay, sir. Failure to take the FIFIL result in the depth of hell. Good morning on that lake of fire, didn't even New York. I'm so depressed that it double my dose of pros at this morning. Well, it's good to see that most people here don't care though. I'm delighted that I thought that this was going to be a barn burner over day here today. And is it? No. You know something the thing I wanted to talk about. That new guy is first game last night was his name. Russian good love. The lava boots. Science number 17. You know, I counted a number of face offs. You know, he won 570 face offs. He was in, but yet in the end of the game in crunch time, we needed to win face off. They put that damn need of fire in there again. And he lost like eight out of nine. Yeah. What's with that? What's with that? He's got to have naked pictures because no matter how bad he plays, you have never seen him ever benched one game by either by any of the three coaches. By any of the four coaches going back to Roger Nielsen. He has never been benched one game. And he goes out and can play the most comatose, the most devastating, the most negative game like he did last night. It doesn't make any difference. He doesn't have something on them. He's got naked pictures like I said. He's got naked pictures of Murray and the two Murray brothers together. So they would have gold. Yes. Anyway, Niel, I hope it's Saturday night. The one positive in this thing, if it can be, is if this doesn't wake up the steam, they are dead. It's comatose. Goodbye. Did you really think there's any chance that this is going to wake them up? Well, you know, something, if I'm a fan, I'm hoping it. That's fine. I'm not going to tell you, but if it doesn't nothing well, because this is the most embarrassing thing I've ever seen. I went from such unbelievable enthusiasm and euphoria and screaming and yelling and carrying on an excitement to a state of close to suicide in just in a matter of minutes. People, people, you're right. Going out of the arena, I couldn't believe it. Everyone was like, shot. They were screaming. They were screaming. If you're panther, yeah. I mean, just wild. They were just couldn't believe it. But you know what? It was a tank job that nobody could have believed. One more thing, you know, I've been missing on Murray, even though the players did it because he did nothing to change. Well, I'm not, no, nothing. I think the lucky was helpless. That's right. In 70 by on the ice, you know, to regenerate enthusiasm, then do a damn thing to change things. So I've got to pin this one on Murray, and I don't care. You know, I mean, that's just to ask you about it. Okay. Okay. See you. We have an open line of drought at all. Three in day. Five in here today for a day after this cataclysm error. What I thought was a cataclysm event. Like I said, only minutes ago. Thank God that people aren't concerned about such crap. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, and pound 5, 60 on the AT&T. While it's not, they're more interested here on a sports station. And golf. That's what we're concerned about. Golf. Where's it golf? Oh, God. This seriously just stop and think about what pathetic, no life people are watching other people hit a golf ball. And then, you know, getting their golf carts or just walk, you know, walk up the fairway, 150, 200 yards, and then stop and a caty reaches in. He tells him which club he wants. And then he hits the ball again. And we're involved in this. Only of course, because we got to make the money, because we got to make some of that money back that we're losing to Wayne, paying the Wayne for all those. See, I want you to understand one thing I've put it this before. And this is not something I'm making up. This station, and you pour underlings that work here that are underpaid, which is most of the people that don't make squat. You're paying a tremendous, tremendous price to feed, Greg Reigns, ego, because that's what this station's all about. The feed is ego. So he can be the sports maven. The sports hot shot. And franchises of teams that haven't even informed yet, sports that haven't been invented yet. We got to go out there and sell another $400,000 in Panthers hockey, or else, that's what Lee Keller said. And of course, tomorrow in the game in the Marlins exhibition, game you'll notice that there are spots recorded by you, which is truly that would have been on the year during the show if we were on till 2 o'clock. Why is that? I would assume that probably number one, because the rate is a hell of a higher. And number two, they can't sell a Marlins spot. So, anybody want to buy any Marlins spot? No, I'm sorry. Two open lines a day, five, six, seven, five, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, eight, ten, ten, ten, ten, nine. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hey, New York, I'm so pissed off. I knew when I was five, one, I said to myself, someone's going to run Burry. Sure enough, here comes Adam for charging him. And then if he noticed on the end board as foot was leaving, he's flash Burry in the right leg. I'm waiting for something happened. Nothing happens. The goose that laid the Golden Egg Panthers, if they look at Pablo Crosse, you've got to send the guys out and take care of, send the message. And also, this is the... What was the message? I mean, was the fight that Paul Loss had with theagers? Was that supposed to go out to him? I meant we were... He needed to put Paul up on front sometimes. It was play on the left wing then. Let's play center. But as they look at Pablo, we've got to go after anyone does that. Also, on the first game with Charmer when he came to New York and played Charmer and started a V-Finding Flashback guy in the neck. And then the Philadelphia game, days are there in the beard of the Menelike on the blue line. Yeah. I mean, it's waiting for, you know, we've got to get the message. We don't do this stuff. Well, we've got to start chucking more of those spears out there. I think it's what we've got to do. We have an open line of day one in Broward, 560 and 560 and 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Here's a mobile and homestead, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I'm a skate last night. I mean, obviously, uh, unablevable. But, uh, what do you think about Murray's decision to lead Burke and Gole for that third period? I mean, do you think that was... I think that was crazy? Why is that? Well, the... The score was five to one. Going to the third period in Burke had played as he usually does extremely well up until that point. What I'm getting at is that all the sides of the start get through them. And, uh, you just follow whole things starting to happen. And what did he have to do with that? Well, you know, some time you say, Does that mean you bring a guy in cold off the bench? And then you get your team has to fold it up and stop playing any defense. And the guy off the bench is all of a sudden going to start making phenomenal saves, pulling him out of his ass? Well, I don't know. They pulled, you know, one walk on the front, so they pulled him. Yeah, because he was playing a crappy game because it was five nothing they pulled him out. What was the plundle even in there? All right. I agree. But I'm just wondering if you, you know, your opinion on whether they had the load. Or not. So that answer was... Had nothing to do with it again. People that don't know the game like Jeff de Flores to get on this morning want to not go Sean Burke. I'm going to tell you boys that girls before there was any pop-held buray in a Florida Panthers uniform. If a word for Sean Burke playing far better than we ever could have hoped to dream this year, this team would be like the islanders or maybe even the bait. They'd have no chance for the playoffs. And that's the goddamn honest truth. And I was never big fan of his. I was not that happy when they signed him. I thought, ah, here we go. Mediaquity again. But the team goes into a tank job. Pulled up with a choke job that's never been seen in history practically. And now they want to blame the one guy that's held him in there all year. Oh, yeah. He was terrible. And a boy, D.F. You really know your crap. How's that a jackman do it by the way? Maybe they should have stuck him in there. 5.670560, pound 560 on the AT&T Wireless line. Here's a mobile in Boker, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Good morning. This and I was there last night. A couple of things. Like you said before, there are 500 clubs. And I know you know horses. Maybe this is gilding and not the other name he's using. Yeah. That's it. Okay. Thanks for your first vacation time. So there you go. Two lines left out of board. Then we'll go back to, um. We'll like it. The same thing to turn me on as a kid. Go back to that. 560560, pound 560 on the AT&T Wireless line. Mobile in Boker, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. I should have put jill in there in there. Uh-huh. No, uh. I'm going to start jumping. I'm going to start. No, this is a really situation where they should be. Turned to be five. The code is fired. Yeah, Murray should be fired. They got a lot because they've been there. They want it because they blew a game. No, not a game. They fired the other code because the owners wife didn't like his language. That's why they fired the other code. No, I understand that. But I'm not talking about this team. Other teams had this situation happened and the code's just a gun. Have, have what's the situation are you talking about? A team that wins and they lose three and then they win one and then they, uh, they blow games. You know a situation that's been just being the thing. They're not the greatest team. Sir, this team suffers other than Bre, if you take him out of the equation. And I'm not a Terry Murray fan by any stretch of the imagination. This team's suffers from a lack of talent. They won without burying on the other day. So what does that mean? They played a Phoenix team that's been losing every game. If they play a girl's team, they lose. What does that mean? That means they don't like to close their playing for. Go to one of those dinners. They have the fucking the suit dinner. Yeah. I, I said that in the beginning of the year when he started with that, that's kindergarten business with, you know, sitting guys up because they show up two minutes away for practice. They're not going to put up with that. I told you earlier the beginning of the year they would not play for Terry Murray. I think that's the right right. Yeah. Yeah. But let me ask for this. Who would be the guy that would fire him? Well, they could unfortunately, I thought, yeah, pictures of the Murray's and high-zangers. So nobody's going to be the guy that would fire him. Wouldn't that be the general manager? Yeah, they need to fire him too. Okay, thank you. And there you go. Now you talk a little slow there. Better late to never. Oh, but the kids, the youngsters in the organization. Yeah. Four minutes till he has Marty stock at doing by the way. Is he feeling better? Anybody have a heart or a liver? They stuck. We'll arm Jerry all will. On the right hand of God. And when I woke up today, I put up TV on it and stand with Kathy Lee or C.N. I saw a purple creature with a gaze. I know this head. It wasn't upside down. Try ankle purple thinking, Linky. Up, down, try ankle purple thinking. Hey, hey, look at me. Where are you? Just when I thought things wouldn't get worse. I know what to see with Harry. You know little first. I know how. Can they call this a children's show? I won't. I can't. I can't. they have another nice kaç guy. I know purple thinking. Pick your phone. Yeah, keep your phone. Hey, Ellie, Ellie. You're the most discounted Christian huskes heart to believe, but on the gels, tell me who's the TV screens. This shirt is a purple thing, this pointing straight at me. That was blowing an oil though. In the same. The public two and five specifically QAIN. And that by the way is especially for our friend, the book of Brian Hateru sends me a four-page psychotic letter today on I am the greatest entertainer in the universe he says. I got the greatest sharpest mind on the planet, the best radio show in the world. Despite that little retarded twerp book of Brian, and he goes on page, you have to page, rip it looker, I love Book of Brian. I've never had anybody other than this misspit who by the way doesn't have a name. He signed it your good friend, the anti-Boke of Brian guy. You know, that's like going through life as the guy with the eyes. Huh? And it's not necessarily as opposed to a person with an identity. That's like that letter, we got to the other day, dear WQAIN. You know, dear Uncle Sam, dear world, the anti-Boke of Brian guy, who has no name. And the whole life obviously. We love Book of Brian, okay? And he's a very creative and funny guy. He's depressing, but that's, you know, he can't help it. They can't, he lives here. He can't help it. 560, 505, 60, pound-five, 60, un-mobile one line. So our poll question today, and I'm serious about this, what are we ever going to do? Because this is what the problem in the world is. What are we going to do about the guerrillas in our midst? Why is this at every time I say that you become uncontrollable? I think most people in the audience would agree that that's a very, especially after what happened in Uganda over the weekend. Something we need to address. What do we be doing about it? Here's a mobile info, Lauderdale. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes, sir. I've come for a little bit and have a big guy named Peter last night with him. Yeah, I've come for a little bit. I've come for a little bit. I've come for a little bit. I've come for a little bit. But ask an ad, how can we do anything last night? How come there was already a tallyation after this took place? I don't understand. How come he didn't even have a kick some ass every other night he fought in last night? How come he didn't go after Adam Footen put his head in the goddamn stand? Exactly. You take care of that Neil. Okay. Yeah, I'm going to take care of that. Right. Just when I thought that he was really a player that he was starting to develop that there was some promise there because everything else was going so well anyway. And then we find out that he's really useless as Pete's on a frog. Open line in the Broward all three in day to real quiet Thursday again just like today that I came in here that time after a what I guess it was a previous vacation since I have so many thank God. And we've had that exciting news that we got to Povell Bray they made that trade and I come in here thinking that this town is going to be on fire. They're going to be just foaming it to them. They're going to be jumping up and down like ruffle stills. And now that's we've got him and they've seen what he's capable of doing and the excitement. I'm going to say it again for all you sports experts who listen to this fully ballooning sports station. This man is the most exciting athlete who is ever. It's not even a contest ever come to this town and play it here for the for a team in this town any sport. There's not it's not even a contest. And please don't tell me Dan Marino and I love them. Marino needs a great guy and he's a hell of a player. But he's he exciting. He's got a great army's a clutch guy. He's a great competitor. But he's a statue with two bad knees. Povell's only got one bad knee. Thank God. Now. And this town like. I'm sorry. They could bring a million dollars cash in small bills and your backyard put it out there and have to people in the top of go. Oh, what the hell is this? And what do they want for a one of the where does come from? Boy, I got problems now. Here's sunrise. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Yes. I want to say a rabbit or Mars. Yes. Oh, and a playful son of a. Okay. Thank you. There you go. There's a good call. Open line at Broward 2 in date 560 50560. See this the reason you get these calls just like the torps like a mission and it because they don't understand the game. They have nothing to contribute. So that you can't convert with them about something they know us and about they're just more bodies in the seats. That's what we've got bodies in freaking seats. Here's Western. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. Yes sir. Hey, I'm a trans-fine like most of the are from here in South Florida. I came from Detroit about three years ago. Yeah. Great fan of the game. And I had the supper through the Brian Murray era up there also. Yeah. And I'm still the team is in the right length. But I'm here down here. You know, we'll back these guys. Absolutely right. Bre is the most exciting thing to hit the ice since the ice itself. And you're pointing again about. You're absolutely right. Did anybody help that poor guy when he got shelved? He was incredibly getting shelved. Nobody helped him out. Guys, we're just skating through there. I mean, the one goal by four is maybe was his last one that I remember. That was the last school, the seventh one. Right. When he was sprawling around. And not on that. No, no. This was the one when he just skated it. And I think it was a city space there was the one that was trying to hold him off. And he just with one arm held off the defenseman went around him with determination. Like it was like they cared. And our guys just stopped carrying anymore. What kind of a performance is that? I actually got less in spinalic and cowardly. And you're right. Bearer Singh. The season is over. No matter what they want. I don't know if I'll say you might be right. I think that was the thing when we cover from that. Then I salute them. I have my doubts. And Murray went out there and got himself another. Yes, man. Being his brother. Right. Bowman came into town and he tried to tell him, you know, had a pair of stones and said, you know, get out of my locker and get out of my city. Yeah. And now look at him. So I just want to concentrate. That's for you. Right. And maybe next year we get some more help. Okay. God help us. Okay. My Jonathan's God. We have an open line of day one at Broward. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on a mobile one line. It's eight minutes past noon on your Maple Leaf Sports Station.

His whole life is he don't like Boca Brian. Well, guess what? I don't care if you don't like Boca Brian. It's of no interest to me. Nobody cares. If it affects your enjoyment of the show so much, find something else. Find somebody else to, you know, un-know-seate every day. Take up a hobby. Go eat a loaf of doctor, Laura. Something like that.

But three of them then one might think, you know, we're Nein Restaurant, who you're going to have to qualify for all battle up on the field of the field? Six and around the side. they let the hurricanes negotiate as contact and they boo him. Yeah. For Christ's sake, I mean, Fedorov's one of the top 10 players. Yeah, but at least those people understand the game. Yeah, I have a different sense. We've been able to smooth. I read in the post yesterday of a day, in fact, the guy trashed you in the first paragraph. I don't even know who the hell he was. But, you know what, he talks about Murray, which is okay. He talks about Murray. He trashed me about what, Ann Murray. I've been mentioned to your name as being somehow against Murray. Well, you mean VM? You know, yeah, I'll keep it being every now and then. It's a very in Murray. I don't like it. Let me tell you, that's Murray. Didn't even mention Jimmy Devolano who really built a red wings. I mean, Murray, the Murray boys are good at offense. I mean, look at Murray. You got Bure, you got Tom. Brown, you got really great off. I think what we're going to do is we're going to get Ann Murray and Jan Murray. And then we can have it in all Murray team. Well, that Bure and Murray's. We have an open line of day one in Broward. Five State was getting pretty weak there. That call five six, seven, five, five, sixty, five, sixty on the mobile one line. Is this a hockey town? No. Have I told you that for years? Yes. This is, where it is. Okay. I mean, I can keep screaming about it. Is what it is? Just like I'm telling you, go back a much Godfather 3 again. That one scene where I'll patino says to Vincent. He says, you are what you are. That's it. This place is what it is. I can scream and rat and rape. I've been here for twenty-three years doing that. Is it going to change? No. It's a banana boat dropping off place. It's a outdoor funeral parlor. It's a place where the most exciting thing they got going on is a golf. Right? So there it is. It is what it is. How's Andy Garcia doing by the way? Senior might be here. Here's your field, B. Chillow. Hello. Yes, sir. You know, been watching an hockey for quite some time since about 1975. Oh, my God. Watch the bill, tell me. Bill, the island. There's an am watching him try and build a team here now. It seems to be doing a fairly good job. But when you're watching a game and you're watching a lead slip away during the third period, Murray didn't call a timeout. Well, what do you mean he seems to be doing a fairly good job? Well, what does that mean? Well, with minimal talent and starting to build up on the talent, he's got a solid solid front office. I don't claim to know enough. What's behind the camera? What is that mean? What does that mean he's got a solid front office? What does that term mean? Meaning that building towards something that's not a fly by night order organization. They're going to be around for years and years and years. And I just looking to trump this up and then sell it. Like other franchises in this area. Like what? What are the islands like? You've got a couple of solid organizations in this area to do often to usually solid. The islands couldn't if those would happen to them. Well, first of all, Bill Torrey doesn't own the team. Wayne Heizinger already has been looking to sell it. He's going to sell hockey team. He's already said that. Well, he very well made. The problem was watching a team view of the night last night. I was at the game and watching a coach sit on the bench. And not send out retaliation for dirty stuff. Well, I'll ask now. So how can you say that he's built this great front office? Well, that's a good amount of code solid. I think sometimes that needs to be taken. How do you get rid of a GM and a coach at the same set the same set? Of course you win their brothers. Yeah. But I joined at the, at the lip. Maybe that's why Brian Kent speaks to Richard. They're joining at the lip. Part of the problem. Oh, Eric, he's getting away. To see the coach sit there during that third period and do nothing. Don't pull the golly. Don't change up. Don't send them. What's the route? I just sat there. I had my mouth open to hold so clear and just watched it and couldn't believe it. I still can't believe it. And I and also can't believe that the people in this town are so disinterested that they, they're just not in a state of maybe they aren't a state of shock. Maybe they're in a coma. Maybe they called into a corner and stuck there. Thumb and I don't know. Well, I'm a season ticket all the sense they started this team and I have, I know a few people on the inside of that organization to people, you know, actually weighing in a couple of his business partners. And they're very, they're very conservative of what the people in the area think. That way, that way you can't see the goal. When you score, do they score goal at the north end there or whatever end that is? I agree. I think there's a lot of people that are going to have to step by be up and speak. I mean, I'm screaming pretty loud. I'm supposed to be somebody that's got to following among the 10 hockey fans we got in this town. And here we are three quarters of the way through the season. They finally got the audio strained out and we finally get some out of town scores. And you still can't see the guy then goal. We're not talking about major accomplishments here. They don't care. The only thing that they do is they panic. They like the fact that the county built into a arena is to almost $2 million. They like that fact. They love the fact that the people are still got a, they're hung over from three years ago from a SNF final. That's fake thing that happened. You know, that everybody jumped on a bad wagon. And then they panic. So, you know, they get forced into going out and spending all that money to get Paul Velberry, which is a great deal. And I kissed him on the ass for it. But in the meantime, this is not a great team. This is a team with mediocrity. Exactly. There's about a mover to away from it. A mover to, yeah, away from what? Away from getting to the building that young guys and they need one or two more trades. You got to get rid of a few guys on the team. I don't like dashing people specifically. Why not? Well, you mean like Kirk Muller? Oh, my God. Oh, like Bobby Newton. My God. And he's a couple. And a lot of other guys that are nonproductive. I like, I like a lot of the young guys who are productive. And you got to keep them and get rid of that dead with. But the fact is, since you talked about what great organization this is, they haven't developed since day one. We've heard about all these youngsters who were going to devourack and need them to hire an AD. And they're all going to develop in the stars. And these people, the coaches, the general manager, they haven't been able to bring not one along to the level of being a star. Forget about superstar. Not one of them into being a star. Well, and the closest thing they had to do is we're going to be the closest thing they had before Bury was Ray Whitney. And he didn't develop in this organization. He was the young veteran that came from San Jose and Edmunds. And he didn't come out of this organization. I know it's that fair to compare and contract. When someone leaves our team, a guy named like Strocco, a guy named like Barnes, or a guy like Ray Shepherd that's a veteran that goes back in from a coma last year. Having a big interview online and learn with us. Huh? He couldn't get the sort of a barn with us. That's right. And then all of a sudden they get to a different organization. They catch fire. Right. Maybe it's time to forget. So that Marty Strocco was paid $600,000 to go away. Yeah. He was paid 600 grand to go away because Doug McClayne wouldn't play him. He didn't have confidence in him. And Ryan Marie wouldn't intercede. So they paid him 600 grand to go away. Pittsburgh took a chance. I'm bringing him back. He's got 30 goals and they probably could have had 40 feet in good hurt again last night. Well, let's see what happens with this solid organization that I think and see if they can do something about. I don't know why you keep saying that. Where do we? Where is the evidence of it? Well, other than the Palm Bell Brey trade and picking up a rate Whitney for virtually nothing. Where is the solid organization? You would you rather be in Tampa? So in other words, you're going to pick the worst thing in the league. And you know, I'm taking things. So you make no sense. You do you just talking crap? What I rather be in Tampa. No. For any reason, the world will rather be in Tampa. No. I don't know if that was a burn steak house, maybe. We're done to tell us. We have an open line of day one in Broward, 5605. I mean, I try to be patient. I listen. I beg for people who know something about this who can have a conversation. It's not just a question of disagreeing. It's a question of people saying something so patently ridiculous and not being able to back it up with anything of substance. How can it be a such a wonderful organization after six years that we're straddle strapped here with mediocrity? Here's a mobile in Boker, hello. Neo, what's up, buddy? How you know? I'm so proud I've been watching the Panthers now for about five, six years. I've had tickets there. Box, I think they could there for a few years. I'm so proud of people blaming the coach, I need a mile of this map. They're a follow team. That's all they are. The mediocrity and the only star they have is Boring. That's it. I'm not shocked at date. Let's see school score one game. But in the last quarter. The reason I called last quarter, man. Here's a season ticket over the school. It's just schools in the last quarter. The reason I called last quarter, did you see the game yesterday? This has something to do with management. Here's a border. It's called, said that though, management is not a matter of the given class. I ordered it. It's a bit of a thing. We ordered a key line pie. It's a key line pie. It's a key line pie. Those are here. A key line pie. So I put the whole team. Please return and give me a note. You gotta go through management. She had to go through. That's your problem. The owner. Which key is the two? The one thing that was around the corner. The key was that half time. Who probably year here? There was a long piece of one here. And that was a lot of the attention. They do suck. Uh-huh. Okay, well, so I hope you enjoy your pubic here. Okay, I think it was from Brian Murray. And the way I should charge by the way. All right. Yeah. All right. Boy, we've been getting a lot of really great calls, you know? Yes, sir. Maybe I'm just invigorated for my great vacation in Amsterdam. I must be from all that hot case sex and that magic mushrooms. Yeah, must have done it for me. Maybe I'm imagining it. But boy, we're leaving getting some tremendous between the fact machine and the mail in these calls. Looking by some of this stuff for $15 million cash, small bills. Oh, I love it. So anyway, what do you say was in the bottom of the seventh inning? Always in the third inning stretch, you said he was stretching it. Right between shove and the key line, Pian is pushed. And then when that little panther guy came down the Europa gun all excited. He's got a great big zipper in the back of the paint. Oh, you know, the horse of the old barn door got the saddle gun around. I'm arrived on the horn. Looking sad, most of the day, I'm going around. There goes Johnny and his mother's back down. All the men left, all the men ran, all the men needs a pillow to bathe. Give your partner a silly start. I'll go and hand her a big circle dirt. Followers here, all raise your hand. Who's going to be the next pivot man? In fact, your partner, home-girl drinks, lick your lips and give him a wink with a great six mile and a great six-knock. That is no dear gerbal deep fly. Oh, man. Are you serious? I mean, it's so cold in all the sudden. I'm going to slip and play over the most. I can't. That's where it's going. Everybody's again agreed on the ride along. Of course, there's an agreed on my face. I'm going to go home and do the barn, most of them roll up the lawn. I've been packing this for a while. I'm going to give you a cup of coffee. I'm going to hang it. Everybody has a big hand on it. And I'm going to go. Come on, all. Yeah. Oh, man. Yeah. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Let's be young. Young man. Everybody's down the middle. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man. Oh, man.

Yeah I'd hate it This thing really knows that he finally said something I agree with last night Yeah You gotta compete I don't care what level of sports you play I play hockey at the 150 dollars to play 12 games at a league Yes sir Every time I go out there I love being out there and I skate my ass off And every level with any sports cup You've got to want to compete They just didn't want to do it last night How can you have an entire team? How can you have all these people out there Putting out no effort except for Sean Berk who was left defenseless How can you have that? How was it possible? You only personated there's no blame for this It's a pothel Right But he was not there at that Exactly It's all underneath your eyes Every player on that ice deserves some of the blame for this I'm not saying it was Sean Berk's fault But I think the thing to do when it was 5-3-5-4 Take the time You'd pull the goal even if it's not his fault No don't pull the goal You'll just call the time out and settle everybody down I think if it makes you more chance to catch his breath I think you make the change Because it's a lie I don't deny I don't not at that point in the game What do you mean? I thought he had been on time out I think I would have been cheating the goal I think he would have been cheating the goal I think he would have been cheating the goal I'm glad you think that's your I don't agree You can keep saying that over and over and over We just disagree I don't really agree with that I'm not a one other point About this organization Yes You had a right on the head We've been counted the company line on this For three four years There's an organization He says it the same way With the same list But the same bull crap But the same affectation And the same affectation He's been peddling the same line And David J. Neel and Michael Russo He's putting this crap in the newspaper Whatever they tell him to put in there They just keep feeding through the propaganda mill And the people are most of them are so unknowledible Oh yeah That's right This one's going to be great And the meantime they're not You got your own kick shot pushing for a rock You're spotting given the damn author spot That's right Didn't hear my a down Yeah He caught your down Right Well you did like that I don't know that they're asking me to do hockey Right I'm going to put so in the game And I want the state Yeah I've had it Okay Okay There he is Emotion or lotion It works for an ocean in the basket We got 62 open lines in day 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 And I was also thinking about that song The fact that One assumes Even though we have a red The gory details that After the president put the cigar In Monaco's Jaina The mother you assume that after that he smoked It was smoking And the cigar too He put it in his No Was it in the rapper Well he was doing that Was he the rapper No he was doing a little hip-hop She was doing a hip-hop Can't you envision that she was doing hip-hop Well today my point of view Since we keep here for all these people Who are into more exotic things like anal sex You follow what I'm saying If they graduated Beyond the point of putting the cigar In their partners vagina To put it in their partners At which point one would hope And pray that they're not lighting up after that Do you find it? Do you find it? Do you find it? Well I'm telling you these people need instructions And this time they're very, very, you know, easily swayed Well the cigar's already brown They're very, two open lines in day 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 Right going in pound five, 60 And the other 18 and T. Why are the slides? I mean I've had some cigars that tasted like And wondered where they had been Here's a mobile-in-four-laterdale hello Hello Yes sir Yeah, one man that haven't heard and listened about an hour or so What about Scott Melody? He is the captain. Is it any I mean where we see last last 20 minutes before Good for the nice school or early in the game on that two on one With the correct nice pass ride at nice school by Melon B But you're right. He disappeared he vanished He's supposed to be a, I'm not saying that he had a mark Messier he's far the motion goes But I mean every time I see him on the bench He's like he just like he had his head down Had to start up there very Yeah, they mean you know I mean I think it's a great guy I know what about motivation I mean I think what you just said though points out What I would say along and that as soon as they realized that Brewery injured the knee and he wasn't coming back They just gave up. They threw up the two in the towel Next question is what they knew Brewery Been hit badly and dirty by foot Right Why didn't Melon B lead the charge against me? Didn't the big black guy number 28 name Peter who supposedly is the enforcer The one that everybody loves and raves about why when he was out there later in the game Didn't he even the score that's what I'm still waiting for an explanation Just air I want to in there brother. I mean to show you what smart fans we got I go in there. I'm sitting down before the game. Are they talking about Pawel Berate? No they're talking about old peers playing at our else playing Okay, if that's what you like if you like the goons stuff fine That's his function on the team. Come on there and do it when it means something He does play a lot better when Alex sixes in there who should have been play Alex sixes It's one of the few guys that plays his heart out. Yeah, and how these are hard. No, that's right. That's a kind of guy We need in there. You know what you have to make. He's got the race. Yeah. He knows how to play the game Right, he's motivated But where was the big guy name Peter last night after that incident weftory And after a foot picked up Berate and this land dumped him on the ice I have no idea was he in the game much after that. He was in there. He had several shifts Again again you got to start with the captain. Where would it hold the seat? Okay, okay, there's a guy that don't like melombie. I like melombie But he's right and of course you can spread it around they all stuck It's there You fire these house I fire sixes Oh, you cute If you really try to help them and they're great. Well, there he is. Let's ask her Ready. Is that for Don bring your wearing? He must be great. Me. He's picking you up after him last Today. Bye. Bye. Good to meet you When they did a re-planary He turned around and told me you get the picture Yes, we see That's when I fell for the leader of the rat He's not too many good on it down He came from the wrong side of town He made it came from the wrong side of town Little me she was the wolf never shaped a shower A change to tower That's why I fell for the rubber rack One day my dad did find someone new I had to tell my sister with what he ruined He's been a girl for so long He did I told him my couldn't wait for him to go ahead And bump away That's when he shot me The leader of the rat So, no doubt that's not the wrong What's the thing that 560WQ? I think Jocac stole Had a pretty good observation about last night's game We have 2 overlinds in date 560WQ I mean it's only one game that I realize most of you don't care about hockey And it's like I'm sacrificing this show today But it was such a cataclysmic event in the history of human events Even just as a sporting event I think there may be World War 2 might maybe Maybe Vietnam But other than that you'd have to go a long way to find anything more devastating Than what happened right there in sunrise last night Don't talk about it I doubt it Here's a Fort Lauderdale hello Uncle male Yes sir Great That's afternoon This evening Let me ask you a question What style of humor is the force trying to do? Jeff de Flores? Yeah, I had no clue He comes up and he starts talking about something And I guess he's trying to be funny Yeah Would you explain it? Are you knocking Jeff de Flores? Well, actually, if you want to, I'm just wondering I think Microniris is funny He's going to be starting on April 1 That's no April full either by him That's your head Yeah Great Well, Microniris He has no clue Because you're right Because you know, defense broke In fact, I mean, I'm sure he's not going to come on here this morning And then right at the end Which is the only thing I hear They're last four minutes usually And a blame Sean Burke Who was left there alone You could have put grandma Moses out there And had the same result Because for Christ's sake What do you do without anybody else to do anything? They might have just had six players and have an empty net They might have, they might have just had him And every, every play would have been a penalty shot And just see how much like they do with the, you know, the skills competition And the all star game, you know, how many can you stop Sean There's nobody else out there to help you How many can you stop? You could have, you can actually sue them for like Well, he's, you know, he's busy Sposing an eating, I guess, during the day They should do that show from the Raskelhouse Because I swear the three old blue hairs They'd like, you know, like Hank does it from Shulas They should do that from the Raskelhouse Yeah, because there's three old babies on the morning Okay sir, I'll give you a big kiss for you Yeldy by the way, who's so desperate From a tear-related things I'm going to get to a pissing contest with him And that's stupid morning show Forget a guilty, small potatoes we'd heard We have an open line in the Grower and All 3 in date 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, it's been a real push here today On another day you'd think you'd come in In the phones to be just hopping off the hook They'd be hip hopping all over this town Are they hip hopping? No Maybe like maybe ten other people are all worked up to a friends That's it, they don't care That's the one good thing about living in a place like this They don't care No matter how many murders they are No matter how many Violet acts of any kind They don't care You can't shake these bad dudes up They don't give a crap No, that's good In a way Nothing phases them Just where is the free food? In fact, where is our free food, God dammit? So anyway, George called over to my dermatologist To keep you up to date with that, did they have the result? No I mean, I don't want to put Stanley under a lot of pressure He's a great guy, he got me right in there the other day He's a big panther fan, he's from Toronto I love him so far But you've noticed every doctor that I go to That told you this before The greatest doctor is the last one you went to Because you walk out of there and you think, all right I finally found somebody knows what they're talking about And then a few days later it's like, ah, geez You know, like my friend at the Cleveland Clinic See, I don't understand Somebody comes in and describes a whole bunch of symptomology If there's such a word And you just like, ah, pick something out of the ear Like I said, well, call her a mind You know, said that I was alerted to the air She was alerted to Adelaide, oh yeah, that's it Classic symptoms No, that's exactly what he said Dr. Paskoeniock, except for the rash And then I look up into PDR And a rash is one of the symptoms of allergy to Adelaide Which even even have that right That was a month ago Tomorrow will be one month 30 days Was he right? No. And then when I went back to the second time Remember I took the day off, I was on a Tuesday I took the day off because I thought Jesus This is getting to be a pain in the plus So, were you fine? It's great, it's this But I made give it a little bit of time That was it Because they don't spend the time They don't devote the time to do it right Oh, and by the way, how am I going to get my old changed? I'm both cars Are we going to have to go back to our friends at executive mobile? We love them, our Greek friends But they probably hate me like poisons Because I ripped them because they were inflated my tires Two times in a row If they were just the my tires alone I don't want to free, we have to pay for it I'm used to that Do you all change that is? Not too much else lately But at any rate Let me say it again You go to Amsterdam, you have to pay for sex Seriously, George If you have to pay for sex over there And you might as well just Before you bring it up I mean, it's interesting to go like if you are of that persuasion To go and see all the hookers in the windows And in my life district, it's interesting I don't have to pay for it here, what should I have to pay for it there? Not what I hear Although flowers are I gave you to take home from Mr. Egova That's a barter Yeah, I see more to trade out Well, he learned that from this place Trade out Here's a mobile and cruel spring, hello Neil Yes sir How you doing? Well, I actually, a couple of things First off, in a fair regards to the game last night Well, actually, we're a guard of the old morning's topic of the young guys Not pulling away Listen, just want to see some things All of these things, right? Well, I had to give you a opinion on what you've been to trading deadlines Coming up and they did blow their water on burry What would you trade and who for if you can do anything like that And then I could have spent a lot of money And secondly, the three guys in the morning who claim to be sports people in Nohaki Obviously, we know they don't know anything But why does the station employ somebody Not other than yourself? But somebody to talk about hockey I don't know if there's anybody in town It was done in X&HL or Come from other cities where they have those guys on top Shows during the day It's nothing down here It's just a couple of guys talking about horse racing Humbling and maybe you'll get some in there about hockey And then you left that golf Well, I kind of like golf So that's another topic for anyway Just basically what do you think about a trading deadline? Who would you trade? Who for? I would alone. I mean, who would you trade it all depends? I would get rid of Niedermire for sure I would give it a cork more But nobody I don't think anybody will take either one of them Maybe there might still be some interest in Niedermire But he's dead weight They're paying him a fortune He's outside of Burre He's the highest paid player on the team And he's not pulling his weight He may be pulling something else But he ain't pulling his weight What about But when you say who would you trade him for? I mean, I can give you a whole list of people I'd like to have But that doesn't mean they're available or they're going to get him In order to get, see this was the thing Vancouver and I get Brian Rihol Credit in the world for this They were in a Brian Burke was in the desperate situation with Burre Because he refused to play there They had to get something for him Just like Calgary had to get something for Theo Furi Because he's going to be a free agent So they had to get something So we made this a horrible trade We made a steal in getting Pablo Burre And Brent had to get a lot of people for get But now, Brent can play with that right now He was working really with Joe Benowski But it only happens once in a lifetime In order to get somebody good You have to have somebody in the trade We don't have that many people right now I see that marketable I'm sure there's definitely a people out there A team that I think would like to have Niedermire I don't like you said I don't know what you're going to get for him Come on, tell me, Bob, you know what you treat somebody away like that How much would Ruben Sandwich would be a good deal? Have a big end up with a two-born deal Or a deal where they go and place them where else Well, let's see, give it to me You might regards to Chris Wells That's a great thing We have an open line of day one at Broward 560550560 on the AT&T Wireless Line Here's Miami Hello What is it?

I'm not sure which was the most feminine, but he was a lot prettier. Huh? Remember when Rick Springfield used to be on guiding on general hospital? Do you? I never watched it.

I think when you have an insurmountable lead, such as that, there's no seemingly Interintimountable lead, yes. There's no excuse to blow that kind of lead. Yeah. I think. I mean, not even calling a time out to slow the blue down. It's just that. That would have been done the claim on the bench. Brian Murray would have been going nuts this morning. Yeah. That's the head. I mean, I was a waiting for Terry Murray to just throw a white towel out there. I mean, you were okay. We could have no emotion left. Yeah. Well, he never does. No emotion. When's the last time you ever other than getting pissed off at an official? And the officiating was the worst. But when's the last time we ever saw him have any emotion on the bench? Yes. We were arm-sported like Roger Nielsen, like a ranch. We already had one statue here. Zero. And I mean, neither Meyer, he looks like a deer in the headlight. Yeah. Exactly. That's very well said. He's in a fog. Yeah. He's a total fog down there. Okay, Neil. Good luck to us, sir. Bye. Saturday will be the big test, baby. All you guys out there. All you players. All you.

They are calling right now on his station and now said, Everybody's kept their stub from my snuck. It's a refund. Yep. Not a bad idea. And Rimmer can buy some beer for us all. No, you're holding your breath on that. Yeah, I was sitting there watching the game. They've stopped. They totally stopped. They've stopped to join out. They're watching the game. I'm hanging out with the buddy of mine. He's pitching for a thing. But if he wants, it's five nothing. He wants to watch his monochlorovinsky crap. Like, all right, the games of blow are we going to go ahead. I turned back. I couldn't believe it. I just absolutely couldn't believe it. We go into a publics after the game. And there's some hockey fans. There's some people in Omeen. There's to know you were at the game. I said, yeah. And I told them what happened. They just did their, they actually dropped their meat on the floor. Yeah. It's how shocked they were in the publics meet department. They dropped their goods on the floor. And they're meat to it. Right. Unbelievable. Okay. Good luck to one. Yeah. I'll throw the panthers. You're a bunch of flating to spend. Okay. When it's spying on us, and by the way, Jennifer wants us to question of those guys that were out there in the third period last night. Anybody have a heart or a liver? No. Well, I've heard you want the water paint and don't come around here. Looking for a transplant. They got no organs over there. They only got one organ. I think they were all having a group of yank on it in the third period. Oh, brutal. How can a group of human beings be as ineffectual? And they're not as ineffectual as pathetic and embarrassing and humiliating and degrading. Especially right on the heels of having, I mean, everybody was really into it last night. Had almost a full house, packed crowd on a week night. Real enthusiastic. Real excited. Brey had everybody say it was scintillating as then he got a van with say scintillating. The break away the short handed break away was fantastic. The power play goal was great. And then the goal from the circle there that impossible shot. Patrick Frog gives him like a little tiny space. And he shoots it in the over shoulder right in the top shelf in the net. Unbelievable. Probably we're going nuts. And you tore our kishki's out. You just reached in. So you know how they have that that phony surgery and the far east. You know what they do the thing with, they're supposed to reach your hands and they have all the chicken blood and everything.

Coming to work in our sales department. He was gone like in the middle of the night. Just like Tom Deodlake. I like you. I'm going to tell you. He was gone like in the middle of the night. Just like Tom Deodlake is bailed out of Miami in the middle of the night on his way to Phoenix and his car without telling anybody. Scott's words just vanished in the middle of the night like Raymaland. Here's a mobile in Cooper City. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Congratulations on your 23 years. Thank you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Did you get any more football over here? He has told. It's over there. Tell me. Tell me. Now? The money for euro companies, Uh-huh and uh, three minutes. Who almost ran me over? But none other than I'm going through up right there. My wife almost threw up. But through the whole. Uh-huh. The whole was right there. Yeah. Great way. I hope to. The three had a good time. We have an open line of day five, six seven. I was three man five six seven, five six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, on the AT&T while the slime. Here's a guy that went to the golf tournament. Okay. It went to a golf tournament. Oh, what? When you be ashamed? When you be embarrassed. I mean, there are a lot of things you don't want to tell people. Like if you got a small penis, if you're like in the closet, if you like, uh, you know, have a deformed, uh, back to whatever. There are many things that are embarrassing. You don't want to go around the announcing. But to admit that you actually went to a golf tournament. Uh-huh. Please. Boy, that closet must be gigantic. Here's a mobile and cover-ragged, yellow. You know how you're suffering now? Great. Now who's the guy that disappeared in the middle of the night? Tom don't like us. Like our defense. Yeah, that's right. The middle of the night. We're going to put him out there last night. That big Puggy ball of crap. You had it done better. A couple of things what I've heard most of today. This is a game that you just file away and forget. We stole one from Detroit. But we kind of got stone last night. But that can't have never looked at it again. You filed a whatever you wanted. Have you even read it? Yeah, that's. Un-un-un-neverty even think about it. Really what is it? What if you want to be objective, sir? You look at this season with all of these ties. What do we got 15 ties? I'll- I'll- I'll- I'll- I'll- I'll win with some of those. You have to. I mean, and- and in most of those games, except for the Detroit and the first Toronto game, which we're going to use comebacks. But I'm in that most of those tie games, including all of the Carolina games so far, where games when they had the lead twice three times, and they ooble lead over and over again, and had a settle for a tie, which they need those points. Well, I agree with don't pull the goalie. That's in no one situation. But he was just playing by himself. I do agree that if there was a time for a game misconduct, one of our guys should have done it after Burai went out. I mean, Burai would have done it. But Detroit, you're right. You know, uh, you're going to say, I'm going nuts. They should have gone after Adam Putin's. Like, uh, cleaned his fight. You know, missing him isn't a big deal. He's not an offensive threat. Right. And up- I'm disagree with their other guy. Don't- It's not mellambies fault. You know, mellambies not as- else spoken and loud as Scrooondland was mellambies. He has his own style. It, you know, you can blame him along with everyone else for last night. But yeah, I like- I like- I like- You know, you got a nice game to learn. Really a big piece. A lot of crap and he's old and plotting and Dylan Skateball. But he goes out there and usually gives you a real good effort. I love mellambies. He takes too much crap. Let's try to do it again Saturday. Okay. That's the luck. Oh, okay. Yeah. No, don't say, let's try to do it again. Well, that's not too bad again, please. I couldn't take one more of those. Any information on Pawel, Burai, what is coming back? No. The status of that injury? No. No. Okay. Well, it is your sports station. I'm looking for some information. We got any? No. And by the way, let me say it again. Jim Barry and Jimmy Siffelis. We just had a bulletin cover and they be loped. They're joined at the hip. They're on a bus to someplace. And we hope it's only a one way ticket. Nice coverage last night. You bozos. What do we got to see? Do we get information? No. We see Jimmy Siffelis standing in the pouring rain. Standing outside Madison Square Garden. Like we impressed. Okay. Like I really burched up his image. God, will you kiddin' Jimmy Suitart? Yes, your results are not in yet. Well, when I have a thick gun to be him already, see this? This is getting like, uh, ponderous. Let's get the show on the road with this. I'll find out what they'll all, uh, to be honest with you, that I feel a lot better. Once I hear the results, oh, it's a leprosy. Then I'll probably feel worse again.
