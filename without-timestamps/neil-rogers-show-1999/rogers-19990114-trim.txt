The opinions of Neal his guests call his or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions or the easily broadcast. No, Neal Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAM. The new Colour 567-0560 QAM is amazing Thursday boys and girls. Wow, yes Virginia, there is a press conference and we'll be carrying it well. Well before we get to that let's read this fact that we got from Peter this morning, alleged, which I'm sure that's a phony name but nevertheless, because nobody the stupid would put a real name on it even just the first name. Neal, I am a Paul spelled APPAULLED. I am up at Paul Ed that you didn't carry the press conference or Michael Jordan. Jordan is someone who can speak properly he is intelligent. One of the greatest basketball players who played for 13 years who was an icon in some of the high statue known all over the world. You arrogant, a statistical idiot won't allow us to hear his press conference. If you didn't want to listen, you should have gone home and leave George to complete the show. Yeah George would have been real on it. Oh, I remember. He was hot to try to put that crap on, right? No, no. Today you had better carry the Jimmy Johnson's press conference. Well you are so illiterate Peter, so the one you want here about you dumb John. You had better carry underline the Jimmy Johnson's press conference. Who do you think you are? I think I'm probably. You must be miserable and I miserable? No. You dislike everyone and everything. You don't like football or basketball wrong. I do watch a lot of football as a matter of fact. That is much as I used to because quite frankly a lot of it's boring and basketball you're right. I don't like it. Much of seven foot freaks. This is your rights. That is your rights. Peter you are so illiterate. You must be the one that's miserable and must look at the merits they got of my dumb. Are you dumb? Why do you want it a privacy of listening to a press conference? I'd dare you to read this on the ear. Reason is the fact that you are gutless. Well, how do you like that Peter? I just read it on the ear. Verbe de Mord forward including all your illiterate bull. There you go. And yes, we will be carrying the Jimmy Johnson press conference. Not because of your fax Peter but because I already as soon as I read it in the paper this morning when Bluff Lips he called me at home this morning. I said of course we're going to be carrying it because it has to do this in all the compensation and it's something that's happening here and it's a total out of the blue shock that nobody expected so I'm going to love it a clock will carry it in its entirety and Georgia now sit back here and eat lunch. Well you'd better you know you had better carry it. Or else or else I'm going to put my pants. Is what Peter says and maybe you get a brain. In fact, that's where his brains are and his back going and my wind up in his pants. Would you at least be tangible and right there and open the view for everybody? Absolutely positively on the light. I'll be saying again, I know I talked to a lot of people about hockey game last night about several people. I'm a ziggin people by the way including lots of Toronto folks and every not one of them said anything about chea was really ashamed you didn't carry that thing we all agreed that who the hell cares? They played the whole thing at two o'clock and now they play the whole thing. They've got to pull some of it and by the way yes I did listen yesterday because man it was on. But it anyway. No he played clips of it and then maybe later on he played the whole thing and I would expect him to have played it because you know why they're how else you're going to kill two half hours. No ordinary not in all fairness ordinarily. Manage is not a guy that throws on press conferences you know that but you don't listen so have you know that. But at any rate that he did because obviously it was a big sports story and like I keep trying to tell these mental cripples like Peter this is not a sports show. It's the Neo Roger show kid is not a sports show Michael Jordan has got nothing to do with this show with this town he doesn't play here he doesn't play for the heat unfortunately and that's it. So the fact that CBS thought it was a big stimulus and CNN and everybody else in a god damn well that's their a prerogative I didn't think it wasn't I still don't and it wasn't really news I heard during the commercial break south of the audio here on CNN I heard a couple of comments he always got to spend a lot of time with his kids and his families important and it's a full time well that's great. So so is there something is shocking or exciting about that again like I'm in the situation that this is happening because last week I mentioned several times this business about jock press conferences which in the past I mean Michael Jordan thing obviously there would be one but in the past there wasn't all this business after every ball game after every pinnacle tournament there's got to be another press conference who the hell cares but because we have all these sports radio stations and TV stations and the 24 hour news networks they got a lot of time to fill up. So naturally this helps to put a lot of crap on the ear to fill kill some good time I guess or bad time. It's just in and 90% of the time everything they say is very predictable as Jimmy Johnson and they it was not predictable and yes I have some plots about it even though I don't talk about sports or that often very much because I'm like a spectator I'm not that involved and certainly not emotionally involved like I was with the least last night just a quick comment about the well so many things all going on at the same time first let me just say there's just briefly we'll skim over this the set of impeachment trial of the president begins today officially but we don't I just skim right over that because that's not important okay now the a Panthers may get pop out the boy you know today it looks like maybe there's a chance wow that was here to admire head around I should go for that and Peter Warrell in the minor league I'm telling he's not a player I've been tried to tell you bozos that for the whole the end of the including last year not a player never gonna be and the Panthers made a great comeback there sparked by Ray Whitney in the third period in the fact that the Maple leaves were like out of gas too many games in two few nights the we don't make excuses will take the tie thank you but again the Panthers fifth time in a row they made a nice comeback Ray Whitney sparked the comeback with the first goal and after that they won fire and least were a gasping for oxygen although I will say this and you know Maple Leaf fans we don't cry and we don't know like some the other fans about the officiating but the third in the time goal it was off side that he pulled it out of the blue line and interestingly enough some of us all around me we heard a whistle it must have been some jackass in the stand and I sat back in my seat thinking okay it's off side to play is over next thing I know I look up the puck isn't the net the crowd is on their feet there screaming the game aside I'm thinking wait a minute that was off side but like I said we make no excuses we ran out of gas and the Panthers to their credit came back and tied it up so everybody went home happy with a point last time horrendous game two bad there were like 5,000 empty seats this morning's papers will tie to the official attendance which includes the season tickets sold 17,500 and 500 and some odd but the actual number of seats for people to return thousand I know this for a fact from people on the inside was about 14,500 and of all the teams in league for some strange reason when the Leafs come down here they don't draw they don't draw most point more the most goals of any team of league this year certainly one of the two or three most exciting teams in league does that make a difference to these people now do not they don't draw and by the way and the people in front of me the baby people weren't there last night God bless you thank you so much everybody in my section was well behaved on our best behavior I saw the whole game no problem with 8 billion people combined say hello the only one who acted a little bit bizarre and effort was unacceptable because we're not impressed by your standing in the in the aisle with your cell phone while the game is going on was Lenny the limo drive with your couple of guys finally screaming at him hey sit on asshole the games go on he all of a sudden speaking in fact that Lenny would not impressed your good guy your who you are you know and I you have a great limo service and also can got a great limo service to a case he missed yesterday apologizing profusely for that jackass they're called Tuesday can at all points limo's in services great guy in fact such a good guy that he even got other people impersonating him on the air which is the first on the all the years I've done a show that's the first that we ever had anybody calling in impersonating a limo driver she ought to be honored can that anybody takes you that seriously and that is that jealous I guess maybe it was Lenny I don't know but anyway other than Lenny's limo driver everybody was on their best behavior it would turn into a stimulating game and again the panthers played only one period the third period but nevertheless turned into a terrific battle and lots of better for 5,000 and TC the greatest column I thought the one about the leave on and about the fact that the Danle Bastard oh he was Cuban it was us we won the world truth I thought that was the worst article ever written my life but the one today the one this morning please Jimmy reconsider and stay is the headline by Danle Bastard and the mommy here this article could have been easily written by a five-year-old child or by someone who has the emotional maturity level of like I said a two-year-old child now I'm in a tractor tent we'll be hearing a Jimmy Johnson press conference from from pillar to post as soon as it happens you'll hear it on the bottom I was if we get ready to be the fact again that was pretty good Peter you're a bastard I know someone that can do us a sandwich or a drink it must that's getting sick the skin is check I know you're just bleak that heroin's being you got to lay off the blow it must that's getting sick we want to know what's the deal you close the trap when you're in rehab your worst the malimic 155 50 WCM so getting back to Jimmy and all this shock and the basement here the fact that he's gonna resign and now it's in about 45 minutes or their bounce now you can you can look at this anyway you want you know you can look at it from you know he says that he's got to spend more time with his family he's basically don't want the pressures of all this BS anymore he wants to a change of the rest of his life his mother died a short time ago his father's a fighting cancer he's on chemo etc and so on you can believe that an accept that is being the only reason he wants Peter King of CNN SI this morning said that basically things Jimmy doesn't see the players being motivated the way that they used to be wanting was with Dallas and how they just they don't have the vacation and motivation and it's just the too much of an effort to try each week we can't wait to motivate them to get out there and play that's part of the reason that of course there's the business about you know being thin skin and doesn't like to meet you criticism etc and so on which of course if you don't like to meet you criticism it's wrong profession to be in but I will say this and I did listen this morning coming in because obviously this is a major story and needless to say it's one day what I have to be listening to that I want to or not and listening to the colors that called in and the venom and he has to add it really there are no gray areas there there are no human areas here in other words maybe this is a guy who just fed up and he's got plenty of money he only the money etc I may just as a model do this anymore there's none of that there is either people like Dan LaBastard who are such emotional cripples that they're on the verge of tears and having an interest breakdown because the football coach is going to be signed or the majority of calls that I heard and I was here to about a half an hour the majority of them were like venomous and while we knew when he came here he was a piece of crap and you know bump and just ripping him a major ass not like I said if you're not emotionally prepared to handle that and you don't want to take that anymore along with L.O.V. this stuff that goes on then you're in a wrong business because it goes with a territory but you have seen it especially during this past season you only do that one press conference early in the season when he chewed the hell out of the press just absolutely went bananas and then of course the situation with this radio station and calling in on the morning show and then getting up the thing with boat camper on here the guy has very thin skin he's a hothead and unfortunately a hell of a lot of people in coaching positions like the Marine boys there are couple of hotheads is what they are can take no criticism and I don't understand that if you're going to be a public figure like that if you're going to go out there and you know put on a show for the public and expect them to subsidize it and emotionally and tangibly support it you got to be have to have to go to the skin and that but at the same time is it going to change our lives? No I don't think so but it's very fascinating to me since this is the the anti-Sport Show and since we get you know somebody these factions like the one I just had from a little bit Peter and some of these other more on the jocks nippers I was the one that told you two weeks ago Beyond a shadow of a doubt when it was told to me directly by somebody who knows beyond a shadow of that Dan Marie joined Jimmy Johnson despise each other and then I'm coming to work this morning and for the first time on one of the other shows on this station I actually heard that being said not in language that strong but I hear it being hinted that they really are on the same page and they're not fond of each other and yati yati it's a bit so on which is maybe why a couple of weeks a few weeks ago When everybody was saying what you know Jimmy didn't make such a big deal about Dan sitting at record touched on past etc. and so on well they don't like each other they despise each other and in fact I wouldn't be surprised even though I'm sure he can't admit it publicly that Dan Marie no right now is Dan said a Kazazuki he's probably jumping up and down up there and West in a wherever he is for joy because he doesn't like Jimmy Johnson I mean if and how many times have I told you people called in and want me to talk about that stuff he hasn't shown me that much since he came here he's improved the defense they got to tremendous defense but you know something you got to be able to score points and this fanton business is developing a running game there wasn't any running game there never was a running game when they played against a good team so he really didn't show me that much but the life is going to go on it's not like the end of but you read this damn little passage and think that this is sensational please Jimmy we consider in space I'm not going to read much of it but it's just it's pathetic it's written by somebody who sounds like an emotional cripple it starts out by saying is it true can it be uh Jimmy Johnson is resigning uh that's the word that started spreading it about 10 p.m. ones and it crackling like a lit fuse making its way from the dolphins front office to the dolphins coaches to dolphin players causing an explosion everywhere it hit like it hit the fan all we can hope is that it isn't true that Johnson just had one of his momentary mind meltings like he did after the hurricane 1987 to yesterday was and that he's just temporarily sour because he takes losing so so hard how do you like that is that is that emotional or what it is so hard oh zanylla basted boy you are a basket I was gonna say a basket case you're a bastored case and then at the end of the economy if I can find it very way here in a heralds fourth second somewhere in the middle of the middle of all the important stories um not that I blame J. J if he does go back to that life tech he just became dramatically underpaid my home when doing the same job in Seattle just got double the paycheck tech former coach John Madden makes five times which Johnson does just for describing other men's coaching please Jimmy reconsider the dolphins need you so very much clearly more than you need them is that not that doesn't that scare you I mean this is an adult writing in what is supposedly the superior newspaper here in South Florida certainly the best known in America much more so than Sunson will remind me hero the soft proclaim prestigious remind me here all here's an adult writing this oh not going now don't not the kids of America okay little kids little infants I think are far more mature and prepared to handle the hazards of life like maybe the coach your football team resigning I mean your coaches like as soon as the you know season ended their coaches getting fired and quitting and going here in my home room leaves uh pack of the packers to go off to Seattle I mean it happens I hate to break the news to you Dan you're better lock yourself in brace yourself real tight it does happen coaches quit players resign after to get their first ten billion dollars like Michael Jordan players resign oh no how is life possibly gonna go on for us now I mean this is a classic this really is I'm gonna I want to save this I'm gonna frame it please please we beg you and of course this coming from the same media that have been dicing him up for the last several months now since back in August just dicing and slicing and ripping and tearing and etc when so on which of course that's their prerogative I mean you're gonna have to take that if you want to be in that position you have to take the good with a band if they're gonna splice you up so be it you can't have thin skin and be a professional coach or manager in sports you just can't do it like Pat Roddy would say if he can't stand the heat and go follow some other team that's what he said okay let's get some real serious input on this here now because I know obviously from here what I heard this morning the town is full of shock and venom and psychosis I mean this is obvious even more important and of course I guess didn't even want to be upstage by Michael Jordan to run I mean who the hell is he so he's gonna show him a thing or two today and we'll have the press conference for you don't panic we'll have it Peter in fact maybe between now when the press conference starts you can start to take in some lessons you know and something open up the dictionary learn a couple of words add your vocabulary make maybe a couple of spelling lessons might help because I am appalled by your effects five six seven oh five fifty pound five sixty on the prestigious mobile one line your dear field hello hello yes well first off I don't think that it's gonna make any big difference to us I really enjoy watching play well I do well because I'm not Dan LeBastered I'll get on with it and we'll get another coach and I personally think that Johnson will take a year off and then wind up on another team could be that's one thing and also I feel that Jim that Dan marino's resignation will probably happen before next season why that I just don't feel that he's going to go the whole next year he's you know he's just I didn't see it this year he did great but I don't know if he's willing to start oh let me see it realistically how many more years can he play I'm a LeBastered in this article I mean he must have been on acid when he wrote it he says well maybe this happened part of it could be Dan is Wayne high-pinker gonna sign damn we know to a long-term contract long-term how long is he supposed to play to at least 45 years old what is the man thinking about I'm in a walker they'll bring him out of the basket they're gonna have to bring him out there to have to borrow Larry Flint's wheelchair to wheel him out there you know that marino's gonna go to a to the highest bitter orchis maybe he doesn't need the money he will go to a super bowl team next year that could possibly happen to those are my things and I know those two didn't get along and it was ever been what just they didn't get along to despise each other bitterly and that's a hard thing to do because they're both they have a lot of pride and they just want to go their own way yeah okay and on the top of all of it is Wayne high-zinga so you can imagine what's going on behind the scenes oh yeah thanks now a lot of zits flying all over the place does it hit the fan thank you sir open line in Broward 2 and day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's Boko hello hey Neil first of all you're the greatest yes I am well when that car cuts car for tight I just got the tail end of it coming up around eleven o'clock or whenever Jimmy's been ready we'll let you know they'll have but we won't miss a word what about TV you know what about what is it going to be on TV sure of course okay you like me you know what we go huh you're going to be like Michael Jordan yesterday oh he's going to be what you know you see the difference being in the rifles Jordan was anti-climactic everybody knew he was going to retire that there was nothing exciting about sitting listening and talk for an hour about how he was going to have more time with his kids and he's out but what was that everybody knew he was retiring they loved him he was great fit okay we have a great life we wish you the best but this is like out of nowhere you know so it's a major happening major right this is major yeah possibly happening here so obviously we ought to be interested instances of the station we ought to demo the interested in it so you think Marino's history why would he be history he ought to be a static no I'm not saying that I'm saying he's got a year or two left I would say one one maybe two at the outside but you know one more I would say realistically I could they get a couple we see is that they're you got to understand every game that he starts could be his last game you do understand that don't you with the two bad news every game that Danny boy starts could be the last one he plays he's the greatest hi he is the greatest to me I mean he he is the dolphin and and well I agree with that I agree with what you just said has been for 15 or 16 years but the fact is again you listen to the sports shows on his station and the people trash him like he's he's supposed to provide an offense without any support no he's without wide receivers without any running game and of course any of them they want to lose even if he has a sensational game well it's Danny he's too old he's a statue he's this he's what he does he has a statue but he's got two bad news but in the meantime you can't you can't blame any of the deficiencies of the space he's not him no he's uh if he he they got a good coach or somebody you know bring someone in and get a couple receivers they're on their way is they got a great defense yeah great defense is great but you can't tell you got to score some points good no running okay have a great day okay no we have an open line a day one in Broward 5 6 7 0 5 6 p.m 5 6 the on the mobile one line is getting real that time boy the tension is money you cut it could cut it with a butter knife you can he's smell it you can feel it like I said you can smell it in the air here's coconut creek killer hello yes sir no yes I'm gonna get some entals in conversation to this resignation to pose resignation today and by the way I had a drive off the road and throw out back to listening to the worst team this morning yeah um I'm glad he's going I mean he's done I don't think he's done anything here and I think if it's going good conversation the girl is in the sun set well this morning got less and a quitter that's what he is okay that's what I mean isn't that his prerogative to be got less than a quitter I mean if he just doesn't have the stomach for it we have to like put him up on a cross and crucify him I mean I've never I've been on a 24th you know I was the one that said that he was setting stool up remember when he was on fire and he set him up for the fall of course it was time for sure to go the brains them was finished nobody wants sure to back do we want to back oh yes huh bring him back no way bring him back bring him back bring him back for a year to which was what I think I think if you brought stool back you're dreaming my brain down to Schula is not ready to deal with the athletes of the 90s believe me I mean we happen huh mark my words in may you think Don Schula is going to come back okay listen George will put you on hold we'll make about a ten million dollar bet okay hold on oh he's gone okay we have an open line in grower five six seven five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one bringing Schula back see this you know people I want to go backward and not for I don't understand that that's like these people said oh yeah we got to have two Barnes on the Panthers huh now I got news for I'm quite frankly we'll have the Jimmy Johnson thing on but I'm keeping my ears peeled I hell of a lot more closely and a lot more interested if that popbell or buried deal comes down today then we'll have something really that some of us real sports fans can get excited about holy makin on this is Joe Bow on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neil God thank you are you tired of that neighborhood yes don't my lunch money I shut up kid and tell you a month to hold a mail next time six time fight back but he's thinking I mean no no no just tell mom next time she hits the candy aisle at the grocery store pick up a pack of new shark ad candy bars shark yeah it's a new candy bar made entirely from recycled cowdun guaranteed to turn your stomach so next time all right kid Jimmy lunch no no please don't take it just shut up and hand it over okay here you go but whatever you do please don't eat my candy bars okay cool oh this tastes like shit so you want my lunch tomorrow too oh yeah lunch you got a little lunch when you take it by the bed shut the cat far 32 or 5.62 and before we take anymore call something much more important than Michael Jordan or Jimmy Johnson or the impeachment of the president in the gossip column in the Sunsemel this morning it says the eyes have it channel seven channel tension sure more than just their love for godddy crime news inside it was told that channel seven macho man Rick Sanchez gets his eyebrows waxed every six weeks by the life of channel ten weatherman John Girard I told him he didn't want to look like he's got three eyes said Robin and Wunch you teach him and Maggie Salon and Spawn Cooper City warm in then you think come in here for that sort of stuff for a waxy a wax job lunch admit and that what the what's it in head brook she also had a wax job lunch admit she does her husband's eyebrows and back too is back he's got a runger army back evidently so the Sanchez ever pump her for channel ten secrets it asks sometimes he said but it doesn't work I already have a homosexual relationship with me also I might as well have one with you too so in other words he tried to pump her but it doesn't work here's Miami hello Neil yes sir I have a serious question here about this older me Johnson thing does anybody in this town give a crap sure they do yeah that's the question he's gone that that's his material anyway did several my love minutes for yeah obviously they do because people are calling you neither either with venom in their lungs or historically cry or like an average of an average breakdown like Dan LeBastard over there at the hell yes they do give a crap I quite frankly don't tell you know one way or the other doesn't bother me there's going to change my life I'm surprised but not going to change away in my life works here's Miami hello hey Neil what's up are you doing sir listen I think the Jimmy he just like said despise marina went to the izinga said that came to me and and marina so got the stadium and the bottom line is it well how did how did that be well maybe he did that before yesterday because we was out of town allegedly it came back well I mean before yesterday spoke about the right morning yeah yeah and uh in demand i think i said listen and i get rid of marina i'm going to get an intimate town oh yeah you can give me said you know i need control and i think i think the marino Johnson thing is part of it i don't think there's any questions about that they despise each other well what's the future with the two of them being here together and like you said marina's not going anywhere and give me a wrench to the town about that you're right i'm he said i'm off he said i'm off big time give some of the boxing there and all you had the dolphins are a super bulk of death i mean we were talking about it at the time you could see it coming you should have held up a science and i'm setting you up don't you better win a baby you're out and he didn't win and he said i was very unfair with it did to don't i mean don't didn't want to get out i know don't was in a state there and we had plans for the next season and also in don't quit you know i got electro something else to do yeah okay i'll have a great day we'll get over it what did you also i got electro something else to do two overlays a day five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty and the mobile one must be out one guy that she was coming back for two years anybody believe that i don't think so i really don't think so and we end then we got the dandelion bad two things that maybe dandelion along term contract they're gonna bring about there in the wheelchair for a couple of years because basically dandelion is an emotional cripple so i mean yeah dandelion bad two that is here's a mobile and jupiter hello okay sir that was a jimmy sand what he was with was a king's coach but i didn't like the way he just placed you leader however i hate to see him go because now you like him and he was doing the games the coach routine at you and he did a good job but did a good job of winning games but i think that uh well i mean you know it's your opinion now we have to take two steps back you know before we can go forward so how do you know that well the new coaches come in that's why i think for continuity we need to get down on our knees and bake for sure to come back to you things no too i do yeah she was nice to back you know he never had a defense to play with now he could come back have a thanks i mean get the offense going again thanks i mean and it would be great okay because we'll get him on the phone we'll get to shoot my seronophone and see what he has to say i just wasn't conscious we have an open line and groward five six seven oh five sixty and pound five sixty animal one last maybe that's why last couple years there last few years that you know the shoot my seron look like he was losing and we started calling the brain then maybe it was i just wasn't conscious that might have been part of the problem but you never know here's north Miami hello how's it going Neil great never been that i'm gonna apologize right i'm called the few of the uh the sports stations with a couple questions and they've dodged these questions but i want to propose this to you when she was there had a code i don't know you that well okay when she was there had when she was there had code so they played a game against sandier go the dolphins did where they had a chance to go the super ball made loss that game during during the game the defense uh tell the offense to three punts meaning that the sandier go punt at the ball three times yeah and my and these offense didn't do anything with those three turnovers yeah and and you know all of the dotty then finally got shiced it out of town and you know the defense was supposed to you know terrible to play so my point is is why why didn't Jimmy when he first get here the defense wasn't all that bad why didn't he draft offensive linemen so we could run the ball and that's the question i've been asking these you know sportscasters why didn't they draft offensive linemen i mean you know that's all Jimmy has done his draft defense for the last three years yeah and the defense wasn't that bad i mean if the defense pumps the ball if the opposing offense has to pump the ball and all offense cannot capitalize on that okay i mean it doesn't take up this way over the border line for my show i can't i can't deal with it so i'm just not like one of those sports you know hank is gonna talk to me on where he's all the other he's all the other one oh hey what's going on you and biggest yes i am you know seven thirty five in the morning and biggest it's all dark hundred here yeah i just want to tell you that uh are you just coming in or going out that's a good question is this Jimmy Johnson thing is uh this is occupying too much of my time do you know you can play war around here now yeah you remember the game i think that's what they're gonna be doing at the mgm of the Tyson fight done set more that's right i'm out of there fast hey i just i mean you believe they're bringing that back

they've even some on their breakfast most there they got the answer maybe he's out maybe you read them a basket come it's a help you know Jim variance in some in practice i just thought we'd steal a few fine moments of time together lay down on my tongue well that's a fine idea don't mind about it by the way what is that you're wearing in the past season the g string well you look just fine now why don't you get over you make these feel like a man oh right not take it easy man it's come down i'm tender you know when i start on the film i'm gonna wrap it all year long that out now man did that told you to take it easy now get off me you did you turn round those are you check out well i've had about it up for this i'm out of here well so the one yeah really is it is made done look at it look at this board now you know it's how they all flew away you want them to lock it's now hankers put them in a they don't know between a rock and a hard place see they don't know whether they go on the attack like a lot of these people and want to be interesting if tanks information is true what i'm sure must be because the children of uh you know call this with that if he didn't have it right that down to the you know all the eyes doted and he's crossed wouldn't that be something huh and just shocked i live in crabbin all of all these people these front running phony's who are just waiting in the wings to attack oh he's a gutless coward and he's a piece of crap and this is what we expect it what are they gonna save in which is why most of the colors who were on their dropped off after hank came on with that scoop and of course in a few minutes i'd love an o'clock or they're about when Jimmy Johnson makes the press conference we'll find out if hankers right and i have no doubt that he is what are they gonna say then oh well you know we maybe had a little hard we judged him a little prematurely he had him on the right road they improved the record one game one more when there be here in yati and all he used to was a goose up the offense that he fences it you marked my words that's what's gonna happen you talk about sickle people so i'll reject he had resigned i mean like i said before i wouldn't blame him i i was never a big fan of his one way or the other but if he wanted to say hey the hell with this crap i wouldn't blame for that because these people are so sickle it's unbelievable it's just incredible they demand and expect nothing but perfection anything less forget it they'll fart right in your face so now let's see what the story is what these people have got to say two open lines today 560 560 560 560 on the mobile one line because the mobile and sunrise hello yes sir well loud you never know Neil he might leave now with or everything you heard from us at morning team now he's i don't think he was listening to the worst team i think you had a bigger fish to fry this morning you know what i was thinking about the future of his life you think you think maybe him uh resigning had anything to do with the dolphin Danny leaving that that my opinion you know he's obviously not gonna resign now well i hope i hope i hope heck is uh he's right well you don't think that Hank is gonna call here and come up with that information if he doesn't have a hundred percent in the background especially get up early too it's the 730 in Vegas you but at fact Hank is on ESPN right now hold on a second pot up the ESPN today i think three years and three days uh Jimmy had a plan to take the team to the Super Bowl obviously they've come up short uh was that the gist of it was there's something behind Dan Reno situation you know i i think that might have been a part of it uh but uh he had a three year contract when he first came with an uh with an option and in last year they extended that by uh by another year so he actually had one year to go and i don't know uh what uh other extensions have been applied or anything like that but uh in the last few weeks Jimmy has gone increasingly disgusted with a what a lot of things about coaching one uh he's he's very concerned about free agents and and not getting much out of him and he's uh been talking to a lot of people about about that the other is that he has not been happy with the South Florida media in the way they've been reporting a lot of things that he's been involved with particularly the one Dan Reno had his 400 footstamp pass and Jimmy didn't give him uh the accolades and his postgame press conference and then the newspapers and radio shows when after him for that uh he was very unhappy about that in fact very disgusted about that and uh the third thing was on the day when the five coaches were fired that Monday uh i talked to him right after that and he was uh he was pretty upset he thought five really good coaches had lost their jobs and he uh started thinking very hard about the profession so i think a lot of those things uh plus his mother's death and the fact of his father was not dealing with that very well at the bottom of the closer to his family all those factors i think came to play and and so Jimmy walked in petty Jones the club president's office yesterday and said that he wanted to quit and uh that's when they summoned the lane and and uh of course they had the meaning this morning but he said he wanted to quit he uh he had not uh really technically resigned and so i think that uh i think that when it was reported that he was leaving there was just a few hours premature now Hank there was the talk that of uh that Dan Reno was the working on a contract extension with the adult and so management how was the relationship at least according you know how between marino and Jimmy Johnson as Jimmy Johnson still firmly behind Dan Reno coming back at the start with that have anything to do with it i think he is on the other hand there were times during the season where they didn't speak very much so you know it's been somewhat rockier than perhaps they've either side has let on but uh but the last month of the year Jimmy really felt strongly about how well Dan had played and he was pretty vocal about that so they started talking about extending Dan for two reasons one uh based on the fact that he felt so good at the end of this uh the end of this year uh that uh he he i think he has one more year on his contract they're talking about extending it into the year 2001 and that accomplishes two things if three options cap room and then also is a commitment uh to Dan to be the starting quarterback for at least uh another couple of years well i hate uh we all know Jimmy Johnson if they proud man to say the least now this has got to be eating him up to look across and see Dan Reeves coming in and turn things around he had personnel control billpark sales turning things around he had personnel control Jimmy got all that yet he's still struggling well he again he's very encouraged about this football team which is why i was a little bit surprised to hear that he wanted to leave it uh you know i do his radio show with him and after the last show i asked him and this was before the Denver game if he felt that he was taking a better team than Denver than he took to the wing when the year ago and he said much better although this team was very banged up and he and he said that if he took away the injuries he felt real good about his team of course the defensive side of it and that he would not really address the defensive side during this off season that all the flaw uh focus would be unimproving the offense to get uh a game break and receiver to get a big back who could catch the ball and maybe one more mean offensive one and that's the direction that they'll go they have about $4 million in cap room right now depending on what happens with Richmond we're wet they're all protackle who they have to sign but they sign just about everybody they want to keep okay really much like so anyway they're announcing i was interested in they're putting the crawl on the screen on the SPN that they've learned the Jimmy Johnson is going to stay with the dolphins and former bears had coach they want that will come on board as a assistant coach and yada yada yada in there you are thanks thank god for hanging yeah so like he's fed there he was very kind there it is come on to the SPN just maybe the rest of the media a little pre-venturer valuation everybody getting sucked into that because he said he wanted a clip but wasn't officially it so there we are on a front page of the herald this morning front page of the sun settle this morning the worst team psychotic all morning long as opposed to like waiting till 11 o'clock and seeing what he had to say like maybe he isn't maybe he won't we don't want to do that doing no wait to see what he really has to say and if he really is going to be done no right away uh you know you get a little piece of material which again shows you the great responsibility of the print media in this town they are so incredibly consistent you name it and they can get it wrong the time of day that you get wrong whatever time it is when they put that the raga there is out they could get that wrong on the mast head that could get the day of the week wrong whatever the issue was to put it out that day because there's nothing ever been invented that they couldn't get wrong and he'll listen to some sentinel so leave a tag nice going hack baby and spread those stupid press conferences here's a mobile in Miami hello hey Neil yes sir I had doing a julio calling for Miami yes sir um I don't know you were at the game last night I know you didn't get to watch Larry Flynn I think was on 2020 oh yeah it was pretty funny it sent Sam Dawson is there they're asking him if he thinks he's doing a good job Sam Dawson he's an asshole yeah oh yeah I know he's asking I don't think he's doing such a good job I mean in my opinion I think Larry Flynn's voicing most of our opinion which is what's going on here and should have been going on right and he's just bringing them down can I say how do a couple friends sure Larry Scottie who's bag okay I have a great day also I'm sorry Floref I'm well hockey was pretty then entertaining anyway we have an open line of day one in Broward is minutes away from Jimmy Johnson's press conference but now it's kind of anti climactic he's staying and you heard it here for thanks for Hank calling us first by the way and then going on ESPN we had it first in the universe how do you like that very jackass okay a little put whack over there to hell with your newspaper got this all wrong as usual just like you got Don Smiley is buying a marlin and yesterday John Henry made a official of the sale is complete to John Henry even the one in front page of both our loose the local loose papers they after they week after week front page of the front section how many times did we read Don Smiley deal is all set to go it's like right on the verge he's right on the edge he's just about ready to score score yeah and to the ever score score we did not oh no so just consistently when you do know with a bunch of little leaders like very jackass and then labasting all these other guys all I'll make you out of give down the best is him credit maybe that cheerful plea of like a five year old emotional crippler in the paper this morning might have been to let's give me a think so no I don't need it 10.54 we better do the breaker because god only knows we don't want to miss a word of the Steven Oates Black I said I'm going to be a little anti climactic and one of the interesting now now I will be listening Hank will be on by the way from Vegas this afternoon from to the 60s out there for the amication to double fight Saturday and then we got booster from six o'clock to six thirty panthers at Carolina a very big game coming up tonight and like I said we'll be keeping our ears peeled to see if we're anything about the popbell brewery deal of Vancouver because there looks like there might be a good chance popbell brewery is coming to the panthers god that would make it worth like driving the 10 blocks to go down there oh god Neil what's Gary Martin doing tonight and climb minds what to know that's why inspiring nice read the Miami hero is Maurice for a really having sex with an alien from outer space it's on the house follow Hawkins the crew mother of the elephant van it's in the house John Kennedy sleeping with Matt him it's in the house it's him backer about to get birth to Jerry fall well baby it's in the house that's that's more hot the old in the house oh Gary heart amazing right style from far across board bubble has no answer our own police scientists just our pop love letters to Neil Roger and we're so sorry Uncle Albert but we never heard of bloody thing also finally rhetoric it's Ellen and ladies if you want the Miami hero available at supermarket check out counters everywhere and we're finally new or is Fred 10 59 is they get a wrong one more time okay but that's not the end of the beginning of wrong until they stop printing that rag forever and ever whenever until maybe the day I'll come and have a real newspaper in this time that don't hold your so if you just know any waiting for Jimmy Johnson's press conference at which you think he's going to resign guess what is he going to resign no thank Robert called us about 20 minutes ago broke the story as he usually does I mean you know the bottom line with is if you want to know what's going on in sports in this town listen the Hank because he's the one guy who talks to all of these people who knows the people talks to the people involved is of course just sitting down and pop up pop up you know talking off the top of his head to his ass with so many of the people in this town do not mention any names or not to mention any sports writers just unbelievably embarrassing so we decided how we're going to do this by the way I just I just mentioned that in passing and let me say it again thank God to Jeff Cohen and our satellite TV people because that's the only reason we got this stuff up here it's a year and two weeks that we've been here on this radio station and thank God to them that we have some contact with the outside world so that we can put that stuff on there so that's what your question yes no also another day they haven't even bothered okay that's great I was going there tough you're the best baby so anyway we can pop it up here because it's right on the SPN in fact let's just pop it up right now because they're going to go into the thing to or just pop it up right now look at that let's see how much more yeah oh there's another was there there have a couple of stuff I'll get back to you there's a couple of reports Jimmy Johnson he's a stick at a round but there have been music and the guys look people like that you know what I saw that we can do better to read this is pretty weird music so they have a little bit of a problem are they taking from on ESPN oh great what about the loses how about maybe ESPN okay what's this what you rounds here and the final what hell is going on now there's he's talking about unimportant stuff like the impeachment trial of the president nobody cares about that how about regular ESPN are they on top of this ago but the Jimmy has that's about that's right but we already heard behind guys to say we want to hear when the Jimmy I guess what we'll do is we'll stick with ESPN and see if they can make maybe contact this is amazing this is unbelievable all the ESPN wants to owe 6 to owe 7 to wait on the direct TV to all of the same thing under Jimmy Johnson and Miami there's this often logo and all these phones who've been stabbing it back by the way you're not going to be allowed in the stadium anymore how do you like that we've been tracing all the calls all these people that said he was got lost in spinyl city abandoned them who's a piece of crap you're out so people are looking for a season tickets now and they're going to be extending his contract and they're going to the Brigadier and Dave wants that and like goes on how do you like that for a good old shot in the old back home how do you like it what is that George what is it you're doing this radio station is amazing to me I mean you talk about having absolutely no game plan no concept no uh don't worry the press conference being held do we like have somebody there oh we have somebody down there like with a with a QM microphone every time I see these things on TV I see like a QM you know logo on a microphone maybe it's just a prop maybe you don't really have somebody maybe we'll pay somebody five bucks I doubt that okay I said maybe we'll pay somebody a buck and a half to go down there put the QM logo on their microphone but in any way to Hank is a participating in going on a great line so about this thing the soon as Jimmy steps up there there he is there's Jimmy going ballistic on a sideline Kevin the head sets off screaming and yelling and looking at the bridge what is it? what is it? what is it? 1230 is the latest rumor from duct 1230 and yes we do have someone out there 1230? 1230 are you sure well I've messaged up all our plans just like Tessio said in the godfather that messaged up all my plans remember that? can you get me off the hook time? for a time sake no can't do it Charlie 1230 and we were gonna have an early lunch here thank god I took my adolescent by the way Dr Mark showed up at the hockey game last night and he's looked at my neck and said oh yeah that's pretty interesting that red thing that's interesting you felt my neck and it was hot it said don't worry about it you'll be fine don't worry it's nothing could be one of the many many things it's nothing you'll be fine that said you know Dr Mark they're gonna put it on my tombstone they're gonna put it on my tombstone you'll be fine is what they're gonna put on their quote mark la porta he's a great guy but he looks at you I feel yeah it's hard it's flushed your fine and I'm pretty damn sure it wasn't the edlet but my blood pressure you know George is a peaking and they're watching me take my blood pressure 80 times this morning I'm really not to have another stroke just to prove a point for that lady with the edlet so I

terminal and just an insult to my intelligence as they thinking people human being by the way that was a big set take memo what is that old take memo what that guy called up with the flash of how do

Las Vegas at 737 AM Vegas time which again I think him profusely frustrating all of this out and getting the real information on here instead of just the rumor it in you went to win paranoia from our

You know before I get to the important stuff You said something about Dave one stand Can you please leave the city to be assistant head coach Oh okay, well that makes sense Right, okay, well that's why I mean it was we all widely rumored that they wanted it in desperately and he's coming Okay, that's what I thought it might be that Jimmy was going to stay as general manager and Dave wanted And I take over his head coach Okay, but I thought he had coach and the rest of his contract Okay, well good job for you guys to get on the story great job for Hank here for Hank especially But anyway, what I want to talk about is how can the Senate save space at this point? I mean I don't understand The can the can't a feature or they'll lose its cost and for sure So what do you what do they do at this point? I have no idea You know I mean there are a lot of obvious ideas I would be I would be especially with Larry Flint wheeling this chair around and threatening these eight other right wing or Republican I mean you've got to know that they're like Dude they're copy between a rocket art place because they're copy between the house the fanatical house Republicans You know who were like you know the Bob bars the course they've already got him and Tom delays and I think they're going to get him and all these guys They're copy between them and this buzz saw like them being the next one to be outed Exactly and and we are going to kind of caught in the meat grinder. That's a bad expression to use and let it happen a couple of days ago here But they're kind of like caught in the grinder exactly, but I mean as as far as the Democrats know I don't see how they're going to lose in this situation Yeah, I'm a Republican, but I'm a little bit embarrassed being wanted to be interesting You know it's like I mean it's obvious I mean if you can it's like it's like dog crap You can you can put ketchup on it you can doll it up you can call it a different name no matter what you do But it's still dog crap and they're taking stuff I mean I don't care how many pages of information they have 80 million pages of information The fact is that the public we saw Clinton we saw the The The grand jury testimony we saw that verbatim then they put the Paula Jones testimony on here and each time they put this stuff on there There's a oh this is the stuff that's really going to turn the public opinion polls against him And this is what's really got to be and it never worked and then you just keep trying and trying and falling on their ass It's actually well, that's the thing that keeps the keeps putting the same information out and trying to I just trying to portray it in a different life Right, the whole thing is it keeps you going to do it in a different on the dog crap, but you know something you still follow crap Right, nobody gives a shot about it all Right, but in closing I have something for Jimmy yes, sir. You pushed their hair for you in the bar I'm happy All right Yeah, we better do something about Jimmy's do okay. He's gonna be staying here and everybody is a pretty excited about that Ha ha ha He keeps calling by the way, who's that the jackass the jackass from 792 7597 Well, maybe not getting enough calls from people out there that want to have a date with him. Okay from this jackass For aesthetic and of course you do know what happens after we give dinner brought me that don't stop it then we move on like the guy that who don't have the phone anymore Open line and date one and Broward 560 560 and pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line Real interesting to watch the way that the whole tone of this community has changed when they got caught with their pantaloonies down He's a quitter. I mean, all I heard this morning basically I did hear one or two guys who must have been related maybe what's down Lebastard doing a voice almost in tears Please Jimmy don't do it. I'm upset. I'm stuck. But other than that I mean boy the knives and the weapons came out you talk about sickle two face a little bastard in this time They were ready to just put up a big cross there right in the middle of God the MPP park and you know crucified a guy Let's have a goddamn lynch mob. They didn't want up there and Washington with the president. Let's have a lynching here a Jimmy and I'll hand comes on here about 45 minutes ago and reveals the news that guess what he's not leaving and they earned out their problems in the ballty And he's staying and they expected the contract that we're getting in Dave once that And now it's like all of us said those people all vanished They disappeared. They put on the vanishing cream like Raymalan. They're all gone. Where are they? Does anybody know where they are? No vanish No Here's a mobile in the North Miami. Hello Uncle Leo. Yes sir. I'm wondering if I could get your your opinion on something Yes, don't you think that all of the fireings and the quittings like Jordan and Jimmy Johnson are just manufactured Ploys by the media to get Interesting something that people just so care about anymore like the MBA who would have cared about it if Jordan wouldn't have quit and the dolphins I mean the The waitem of the Jordan quitting doesn't help the NBA it'll it makes it ten times a hundred times worse Doesn't it look people are talking about it. Yeah, and And I mean the Johnson thing. I mean I was already know not that I'd really cared about the dolphins anymore But I'm actually kind of interested in letting the same way that you know you're interested in the car crash About the dolphins though because they're like they're like wounded This is not some kind of publicity. He's done. I believe absolutely that he was going to resign Or that he certainly attended until he talked the waitem this morning and now whatever they discussed he's you know he's saying But but you're right the medium milks this stuff just like right now I mean you got to understand what you've got a 24 hour sports network or 24 hour news network takes a lot of crap To fill up all that time you got to have an non stop and believe me there. They give it to them Great well, thanks for your opinion and keep repeating that number over and over again. Okay. Have a great day You still having conversations with our retard out there, is that it? Oh, yeah, because I hear some of it through the window And my suggestion is please don't say the effort. But anyway. So we know about what any good. How so about one About People call them again. Well, why is that? I mean he's looking for some companionship. I mean we should don't want to talk to him Maybe there are people in the audience. They want to speak to this guy Who's obviously got some very serious problems at nine five four seven nine two seventy five ninety seven It keeps calling here over and over and get in spune of cities and the vulgarity already has to be a call trace to the cops anyway Good excellent Well, I'll be good. Then he so he better talked a lot of you folks today because after they might not be able to talk to anybody See it's just always amazed me. Haven't done this for about five hundred years just how these people really butcher behind the anonymity of the telephone They really butcher up and even the most reasonably sympathetic individuals become real big macho guys behind the anonymity That little thing in their hand in the phone too A little dark thing in their hand twenty six after eleven and five sixty WQ a m They do you love my jockey shorts I want to get right on the internet company but not at all Lots of sex and we will be more perverse just like me They back or listen back to that Oh, right Those people in their days have lots of links to me But I'm proof six times All my people are four girls in each expo It's best not the internet for the board you want to see I'm a 30 and five sixty WQ a m Dan LeBaston said please Jimmy reconsider please stay and give me said okay and there you go and about now From now we'll be hearing a press conference right from Jimmy's lips in the year ears Well, I'd be really embarrassed you know if I were one of those big mouth assholes that were calling his radio station this morning We had a couple of mine here too before Hank called in at about ten forty If I want those assholes always got less he's finally sees a cowardly turn tail and ran he's the piece of crap And we knew before he came and just attack it as a see it's always the way it is always It's like in this business you know, when they blow somebody out after they leave They were always a piece of crap It's like the bees are there's a good sports example for you by the way I hate to break the news to you my good friend Jeff Rimmer and Brian Marie and all you other Finger pointers down there at the macarina Maybe they're on their way to Carolina right now who knows they got that game tonight Hey to break the news to you John bad these were caught another shot out last night It's for an role for Philadelphia which he's played three and a half of them on Heswell got hurt in their one game Over two hundred and twelve minutes plus since Philadelphia is a lot of gold with a visa and then that's most of the way But he was the reason the panties were by last year, right? So like I said once somebody is gone or you think they're going to be gone then you stick it to him You just stick the shit in there and you twist and you turn he was a son of a bitch he was nobody he was the reason for everybody else's problems because he's gone That doesn't take any talent but only in this case now you got a little bit of a problem Because now guess what you mean even That's what's on child sick but we can't get it so what do I want to see Daniela basket what's he going to do if you can Why do I want to see Daniela basket? I don't want to see that jackass and what does he care about Jimmy so much Jimmy not Cuban Here's my amy lake. Hello There's a little different perspective. Yes, sir. I'm a Miami dolphin hater and a Jimmy hater So when I heard that he was leaving I was upset. I wanted everybody but hey I understand. I want him to stay here and suffer with those guys They're not going anywhere for another three years. Yeah, so I'm Glenn. Awesome. I'm the hell would okay And thank you so much. Well, I got a list of guys being honest he's entitled he enjoys his one of those people that hates he loves hating Jimmy and that's the way it is just like this show There are a lot of people that are forming at the mouth of the ID that I might ever leave here and spread it what they might tell you they're full of crap They would put now do we get launched by the way or is that like I'm working on if they don't have a delivery person say I'll tell you the detail during the break. I got to find a runner Well, when did you find that out Recently. Oh, this is not good by the way. What's on here?

Are you doing sir? Uh-huh. I'm a little bit tired. Let me tell you why. I'll come and you don't say nothing about no Democrats Uh-huh. Because he's part of the party because he's part of the party. You told you that. You've already got the Bob bars in the Ken stars of the world doing that And what you think the White House is paying them anything. How much do you think they're paying them? Uh-huh. I think they're either paying them or doing some kind of favors warm up They're all as he also making up the stuff about Bob bar and Bob limits that he's just making enough Yeah, but what about all the Democrats? No, no, no, what about all the other all the finger point is the Democrats are the ones who are the finger point isn't the Hippocrates. It's all these good Republicans. You just are you just keep repeating the same thing over and over again like a stuck record because you're a silly partisan fool Is what the problem is you're a silly person And no matter how many times I would repeat it he keep repeating it. So is there any point on continuing? No, of course not I mean, I say you know both parties generally speak in suck. It's only the Democrats are the buffer party They've prevented us from the right wing totally taking over. That's what they are around for. Thank God for that But they're both flushing our tax money down the drain like it's coming like I'm going through a toilet and have been doing it for years But at the meantime, at least if you want to preserve any minimal amount of freedom, you just have to hope that the right wing movement takes don't take control Which is exactly what they've been trying to do without even a blood bath Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, you know this morning. I was listening to the show and they had a lot of Jimmy patches and everybody they were ripping him a me. Everybody was saying I know the people who's ripping him pretty good at this morning too, so matter. Oh, yeah, I did catch a little bit of that They were talking about spruer coming down here that boso. Yeah, that dumb redneck and all he's good for is probably often Yeah, what can he possibly bring to the Miami dolphin? Yeah, but often and then what's going to happen? Yeah, he's a dumb little boso.

Can beat that data me. Yeah, that's the perfect place up there in James Hill for Steve Spurier that he fits in there like a rubber glove just to keep them there. Okay I mean we probably got enough you know, it'll be Tardo's running around this time without Steve Spurier coming on here. Go. We got plenty of those already Here's Miami. Hello. No, yes, sir. Yeah, I got a I'm 19 years old and I watched a lot of football and I got this coming. I want to know if you had the signal pin that I do And you just to look at Jimmy's done for like a man who never quit You know you still have this hard core Style of I don't know like deep in the hard man. He was a hard man. Yeah, no, not a hard man, but you know what I meant So you just said you say the hard man, which I don't know. I mean like I trust man and now I see him like you I don't know how I'm gonna put it like now he quit and now he comes back. He did not quit that year You're you're you're you don't know if he had that mentality of quitting he can go on to a football player until now you can quit No, no, you don't think no, I don't He can get one friend But the fact is he didn't quit You know there are a lot of people who have jobs including yours truly who have problems with their management or have falling out or what and we don't know we haven't heard from him yet Whatever the reasons really might have been And eventually he met with the owner or a ball the other day. They got a straight nut and okay now he's staying, but he didn't quit And you're just assuming that because everybody put in a newspaper and a bunch of losers were on their writing and raving this morning on the wrong You know a talk show using their telephone is a weapon again That that makes him a loser And believe me, I got no action run one way or the other would Jimmy because like I said before he hasn't shown me a hell of a lot, but what do I care because I don't have any really better interest And I don't put on the games Twenty two two known let me tell you again five twelve thirty press conference come up hank will be on from Vegas from through the six to live all the inside and again spectacular job by hanko Bertie let's give him the employee of the year award for that of the century For being the only one who had any idea what he was talking about I think a rocker's got new from the National Scientific Research Institute comes a product guaranteed to revolutionize the health care industry The doing improved I can't believe it's not an animal and now from the president's council on health after Arnold Schwarzenegger Yes, this product will clean your poop alike nobody's business excuse me sir.

Open line a date one and Broward The tune is really changed in here. You know, it's very credible here in jet fans with their opinions on Jimmy Johnson Do we care about them? Of course not. I don't care what that lay thing. That's quite a lot. Like all those chronic regular jet fans calling me a morning show this morning. That was really sad Who cares about what they think they don't have any credibility. This is not a topic that they have any input on Let them stick with their own stuff up there. They got big the great fats of up there. Let them stick with him. Okay. He's doing a great job form But out Here's pepper pine. Hello. Hey now. How you doing? Okay, sure. Listen. I got a couple comments. One is I didn't make the radio mistake this morning and I listened to the first team. Yeah, and I had I don't know. I grew it out of the truck. I'm a service man, but Someone called up and said I read the paper and there's the end of life as I know it because Jimmy Johnson was at that time What's reporting if he was going to resign and the life as she knows it. Oh, I had to turn the radio off after that. And I just have one more thing about the Senate trial. Wait wait. What's that? That's on our line. That's on the ice. Yeah. We're still on the air. By the way, what the hell was that? Are we on the What's the discussion with Hockey? Well, Buffalo has the football team. The greatest in the land. Everybody thinks that's right. I say, they're the hot. The Buffalo field. See what I mean. So just sing a little. When you say Buffalo. Then you're that Buffalo bells Buffalo bells. Then the greatest team in the history of human race. Then a Buffalo bells. Then the greatest team in the life. Friend and can't be here. Yeah, there you go. And you and your jazz up that red next stuff. They listen at Ben Joe. Holy sweet guy. Listen at. When you say Buffalo bills, it don't sound so red that he do it. Everybody sing along now. How you bill fan? Here we go. Well, the Buffalo bills are the best teams. They have the best record of the last five years. And they went to the Super Bowl four times, which is morning. I can say for this, it's come second phase and they're the greatest. Like they believe like that uniform. They sure is hell. Be set hot of having a fish on the helm. Because stand out. Buffalo whole bills. The best football teams. What I ever seen in the history of my life. They are the Buffalo bills. The Buffalo bills. The home of Jim Kelly, the greatest quarterback in the league. Yeah, everybody. The Buffalo bills. Get a Buffalo bill. And they've been around long enough to stay in right in fish. Well, let a Buffalo bill. Buffalo bills. What would you rather have as a pet a Buffalo or a fish? I'm going to be down the back too. Who could be a pet like on a leash? Like a little puppy dunk. And probably would do a lot of that in the house. But you could probably pay for training. We have an open line in date. Five, six, seven, five, six, six, five, five, six. On the AT&T wireless line. Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, yeah. I like what Jimmie Johnson's done to for. Yeah. Jimmie's got a defense, a Jimmy Johnson defense. He has an often lacking a quarterback. A lacking a quarterback. Yeah. Not lacking a running back or why do you see this? No, you're a rather lacking a quarterback. Can I just wait here? No, of course not. You think I'm going to, this first of all, this isn't a sports show. Especially event in the community that transcends the ordinary stuff that we talk about. So naturally, we're going to spend a lot of time here at the press conference. But now, if you want to do the Reno bashing, do it on the other shows because I won't listen to it. It's beneath my dignity to sit here and listen to your crap. Okay, sir. And I'll have said before with this. This is just like the people we're calling in this morning. Bashing Jimmy Johnson is assuming that they knew what was going to happen. And now let's start bashing Dan Reno. Jimmie's going to stay now. So let's back Dan Reno, who's only invested 16 years of his life in his town, plus the besides playing the football, then I have a lot of great things for charity and it's well-liked all over time by most people with a brain. But don't confuse people, okay? Don't waste your effort or your breath calling initial to knock Dan Reno. Yes, he's a statue. Yes, he can't run. And yes, he's no John L. Because he's a mobile and got too bad news. But what I'll stand Reno, the dolphins last 16 years, what have been in the toilet? In addition to which where is the record, the record, where is the backup? Maybe give me Craig Eretchen, is that you know? Oh, yeah. Is it face, forget it? Even the mad dog that they was talking about Brian Greasey, they're how come they let him slip through their fingers? How come they haven't been like, you know? These people are like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, it's like, like a mental illness. Like Dan Reno is going to play there forever. He's going to be like the George Blando of the dolphins. He's going to play the 110 years old. Guess what's we'd, our thing going to happen? Well, let's play him because he's a bad guy. Okay, I'm assuming we did all the spots there, Joe. Yes, okay. We had a little technical problem there. Zoltens got lunch. Thank you very much. Thank you to Chuck and easy over there across the street. Thank you for your sleep for a little bit of lunch. Which will also make that blood pressure come down a little bit more. Bad idea, Dr. Mark, given that Adelaide, a real, real bad idea. A dangerous idea that quite frankly, I'm just a psychotic about. And guess what, my face is still flush, and I still got that whatever it is. And it ain't any different than it was yesterday, or did it be full or we could go circus? Yeah, just cut that out. One is not cut it out. I might change it about 10 points, but I'll eat, but I'll, but I'll, but everybody, you know, it's amazing how cavaleer everybody can else can be when it's your health that's it's steak. That's the thing that's astonishing me. Ah, it's a little bit of nothing. It's not this. It's not this. And yeah, I quit taking it at a vasodial later, and the moon is on Uranus and stick it in the rectum and the heavyweight life, you know. And to me, time I'm sitting here not having to take it in the one that I left this morning. I watched in my blood pressure go up and up and up. To which point I finally took it. And of course it takes about an hour to kick in. Thank God, I took it when I did take it. Otherwise, I'm going to be sitting here going boy. Like that, with the, with the, like this, I could be doing my Larry's plan imitation. Yeah, I don't do all this muscle. Not yet. Sometimes it might look like drill. Here's tempered pine, tell all. And the, I was the one who could happen to mention, but we got to connect it about the woman who said to end the right machine. Oh, yeah, I'm sorry about that. That was right at the moment that we got cut off here and lost their line. And probably Bell South was sabotaging us again. I'm serious. This, this show gets cut off more than all the other shows put together on this radio station. We have this ISD headline, which should be their part. There should be no problem with it. And almost every day we get the, uh, dilded around with here. Exactly. It's just sure I know. But other point I wanted to make was as far as this thing going on with the president and the Senate. Yes, sir. Uh, I think a lot of it is like you said it's, it's definitely conspiracy. It's way too obvious that it isn't. And secondly, I do believe that most of the old men wish they had a 24 year old, uh, human door. Oh, right. Amen. Thank you Neil. You better take it. Those right wingers are jealous because the guy's like Bob Bar there. You know, he's got some old bag that he's banging. You can't see that. Oh, God, that new wife of his roof heavy duty. And I mean, to make a triple, like a woman, that's how hot she is. Anyway, better do this. But Neil Roger show now on five, six feet WQAF my amni fortlater day. Thanks. Uh, pop it up again. Would you please, cause he's on the right number. Now, what is that? 207. Three. Three. Now we're finding out what George is watching. Another relationship you say has improved. At least Jimmy Johnson is concerned about the lay. A little later on. What about the building that's wrong possibility of Dan Reno getting that extension to remain in quarterback? How's that going to civil Jimmy? I think things were a little icy between them at some time during the season. But Jimmy was very abusive. And the way he praised Dan's play three of the last four weeks of the season going into the Denver game, he felt that that Dan had played the best that he had since Jimmy had been there and talking with Dan. And he felt that he felt better than he had in a long time. And I think a lot of that came from their efforts to run the football in a way they protected Dan. And I think that they had been probably not even talking about extending Dan's contract which was accomplished two things, help them catalyze where they already have about 4 million going into the offseason and keep Dan around for another couple of years. All right. How about the addition of Dave Wands stat now? Dave Wands stat of course. And Jimmy Johnson close friends. A lot of folks that Dave Wands fought Dave Wands stat deserve maybe a little more time than Chicago. He had a lot of time. Look, I can finally start to turn things around. Injuries helped side track that and immediately he has swooped up in Miami. What is his role going to be specifically? And is this Johnson flexing his own, his own muscles with power? He does not think so. I think Dave is not the power part of it. Dave's role will be assistant head coach George Hill. This is a defensive coordinator did a great job. They had the level one defense and points a lot of things during the regular season and they have a terrific young defensive team. And George is 64 years old but I know he's going to come back and coach again next year. I think Jimmy has always been comfortable with a confidant. Somebody who is close to him, Dave certainly has been. When Dave's first was, knew he was going to be fired in Chicago, Jimmy advised him that perhaps since he's going to get two years of two million four hundred thousand dollars that's a million to a year, that perhaps he might want to take a year off and spend time with his family and just sit back and sit through some offers. I know one of the offers that he had was the B. George Seeper defensive coordinator in Carolina. I think Dave might be inclined to use this to regroup for himself. And I think he'll be a head coach again. And maybe he'll even succeed Jimmy and Miami. Jimmy has one year left on his contract. There's a possibility that Jimmy could step up as a general manager. But that's a speculation on my part. I don't know that for sure. Now, I think we've got some numbers here as far as Jimmy's fourth year in the past. He was very successful in Dallas in his fourth year, winning the first of two Super Bowls. And what about his fourth year in Miami? Of course, the expectations have been high. He has not yet made those expectations. He's this and make a break here for Jimmy Johnson. Well, I think it's a make year for Jimmy in his own mind. And that remember last year too. He disappeared for about a month after losing to the Indianapolis 41 and nothing on the road. And then they played those two games against the Patriots and they finished the season poorly. They gave up 76 points and it lasted to road games this year. The last game against Atlanta and that game up in Denver last week. So I'm sure he's a little sour that way. But despite that, he likes his defense very much. He went in a Denver with several injuries. Jason Taylor is best-passed rusher and Tim Bowens is best run stopper. They'll be back next year. They have to make a decision on Richmond Webb who was his contract is up. He's a free agent this year. They're all pro left. But Jimmy told me a couple of weeks ago that this offseason will be totally devoted to building the offense. He feels that that defense is young. It's quick. It's going to improve. He has outstanding young cornerbacks. He liked his two defensive line picks and Lorenzo Bromel and Kenny Mason. So it'll all be offence. His big play receiver. Big running back. Another meme line. Hey, Goldberg. We thank you so much. Your last Vegas to work the Tyson fight. Can you bring it back in T-shirt? Tyson T-shirt? Or a broken one? He didn't want to. Whatever one's cheaper. Alright. Okay. That's coming up. Well, we're coming up with a press conference that was Hank on ESPN news. Great job, Homer. I'm telling you one thing. Hank put himself on a mad big time. He already was. But I mean, so far, his and shoulders about all these other troops that sit him out. That's that. I bet you don't just talk to the rest without talking to the people involved. Who we don't know what they're talking about. Hank knows him all, baby. When he cut, that's why when he came on there and said that, was there any doubt in my mind? No, no chance. So come up in 27 minutes or they're about. Skipper take who knows got only what Jimmy Johnson press conference at which he will now TV stand. Two open lines a day, five six seven, five sixty, pound five sixty on a mobile one line. And like I predicted, the tone and the the sound of the audience has changed dramatically from what it was just a short time ago and most of the morning what I would have from what I heard. The assassins have withdrawn their spirits and most of them have retreated to the back of the building. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Yes sir. A couple things. First I want to I told you I don't want to thank you both for that great CDs and tapes this year. Yes sir. I took a lot of work on your part. Second, we're writing in Jimmy Johnson. I have this close to him down the keys. A couple of streets over. And I've seen some of the things like you said that he's done to help underprivileged philanthropy and so on. So forth. Jimmy Johnson, not like other people. If you go up an Ask Jimmy, even if he comes in the Marina on his boat and you say coach, can I have your autograph? No problem. I've never seen him say no to anybody. And I've seen some of the real biggies that I'll just sit there and just push your side. You know. And if he was going to leave, I'd say the major reason was knowing him because I see him on I've talked to him occasionally. It was family reasons. You know, his dad wants to be near his dad a little bit more time. And I think that's probably what they've worked out. What's this money? What's anything else? It was based on that he needs more time to give it a sad because he misses not being with his mom as much as he does. Yeah. And then his cancer and his other arm came out therapy. And that's it. And he wants to spend more time with his family. Yeah. I'm sure that that's got to be a part of it. Maybe the biggest part of it who knows. I mean, certainly he's entitled to have a chance to speak his mind in about a half an hour. But to listen to these people this morning coming out of the woodwork like a bunch of termites. It was unbelievable. I'm driving in here and I couldn't believe it. I mean, all of a sudden they turned out his guy like a worker cornered rat. Yeah. And there's no reason to do because he did not come to Miami from money. You know, I mean, it wasn't a money situation. He came because I often make some amount of money. I'm not going to go to sitting in the studio of Fox with his, you know, in a cloth here. I can all of them on he wanted. And making a lot more. Right. Anyway, that's it. Okay, thanks a lot. Okay. There you go. All you were stressed is out there. All you were maniacs. And that's so glad that that happened the way to that these people all got caught with their pants down. It's just beautiful because it shows you the true nature of the people in this town of the so-called sports band of the people in general. Talk about too faced and backstabbing and I mean, turning like on a dime. They can all of a sudden do this incredible turnaround. Wow. He stopped anyway with like, for example, if they announced tomorrow, which of course, it could never happen. But if they announced tomorrow that the Panthers were, and by the way, thank God for Sean Burke for you, Panther fans last night. If he wouldn't have played great, the least what a lot about seven, nothing last night. He's the only thing that's kept those Panthers in game after game for last two or three weeks. And you guys better kiss him on the ass. But if it was going to be an outspot say he was playing lousy. And it was an outspot he's been traded the flies for John Van Beesbrook. Then all these people would have said, oh, we don't like the way he left here. He's an asshole. They were said, oh, man, he's been playing great. Thank God we're getting the bees are back. Bees are phased. It's just there's no credibility there. No credibility whatsoever. And then of course, when you come back to what I always say, which is that most of them don't know what to Talk about anyway, that's playing a lot of it. Look at that phone now. A lot of sudden, they're departing like flies on a pile open line and Broward all three and day five six seven, five sixty, five sixty, five sixty on a mobile one line. Let's align. The Fort Lauder deal. Hello. He, Leo. Yes sir. Did that condenser? Winner's to you. I was at the game last night. It's very disappointed. About one. I was very disappointed about the score. I thought the maple leaf played a terrific game. I played with the great careers and they ran out of steam. Yes, they did. They didn't play very good in their own zone in the third year. In fact, I thought we were very lucky to wind up with a tie. I mean, late late in the third and early in that overtime, it was a miracle that the leafs pull out the tie. Did you get to enjoy the game? I enjoyed it tremendously. And the people with a little baby stayed home. Thank God bless them. Thank them very much. So the whole game didn't have people running around in front of me. Holding up their little kid was great. We still can't see the goal light down there on the shoe twice. And you know, down there to my right. People with sit on the east side stands in the macaruna. You can't see the goal light. Let me say it again. I'll keep saying it all year long until they fixed that. It tells me this is such a bushly organization. They don't care about the fans. They don't give a crap about the people that spend all that money to put in the Wayne's pocket. I was sitting right behind the goal actually last night in the old hand. It found correct. I don't even think that goal light that I was sitting behind even works. Does it? How do you like that? So that's a real big league operation. Yeah. Well, you know, the macaruna is, how much money did they spend in that night? 200 million. 200 million. Oh, probably 20. You can't even get a goal light to work. Yeah. I volunteered way back in early in the season. I offered I said, if I get some real goal light to knit like they haven't made believe gardens of any real arena, I'll put the bill. How much could it cost? You know, a few hundred bucks. I think it's a simple available. I'm believable, but hopefully the maple leafs will rebound. They've been playing. Well, why don't you so sad for crying out loud that they pulled a game out of their ass and Tampa that I've before. They got 51 points. They're kicking serious ass. So they look great last night for two periods. Two many games in two short of a period of time and then the back to back games on a road. Yeah. They go run out of steam when that happens to you. Don't take care of Buffalo. They'll be fine. Don't take care of their own business. Okay. Take care of yourself. Have a great day. My Johnson is gone. Oh, am I gagging? That's from try to eat food while I'm doing a show. Try to get my blood pressure down, try to save my life from a bunch of crazy people. Oh, yeah. Just get out of stock taking the pill. Oh, God. And here my doctor was at the game last night. Looks at my neck. Oh, yeah. That is interesting. That was near my ass. That is interesting. And I said, what does that mean? Interesting. Oh, could be a whole bunch of things. But don't worry. You'll be fine. And then he steals my neck. Oh, yeah. It is hard to twerm your head. You're fed you out and it is again today. Doc, no, no, you'll be fine. Just remember folks, I'll be fine. Do you believe it? No. I'll be fine. Anybody have a heart or a liver? Look at who's the bar that the town is jail. Old J was there a heap again, and the whale. So God, I'm in it. This was very good. He dragged too much. And the time is the one that's looking for something to watch at those jobs. Loosen all the jailhouse jobs. Everybody was rather there a sock. Getting ready for the jailhouse jobs. This, the fact was to look so well, saying that as marriage was a living hell. The cops in the corner with his burrito. He says his talk about his way to go with old jobs. Loosen all the jailhouse jobs. Oh, right. Everybody was grabbing their socks. Spion and jailhouse jobs. And he was a jailhouse job. Watch it and I'm fucked up right. Loosen them, stay for their jobs. Everybody's checking their clothes. Everybody has had hard nights in two to go jailhouse jobs. Suffer King and five six, you WCM, all the day lines are open by the way. All three, which is astonishing to me. But if Bobby Flacca said the millions of assassins, they're the ones who pull up the lines. Like I heard this morning. They come out of the water class. Soon as I sat down here this morning, start talking about this. There were eight billion of them on there. But now they know what the screen reached here banana. 670560, pound five 60 on a mobile one line. About 60 minutes away from 1230 when the press conferences schedule will begin. We'll have it for you. And I can finish my lunch and peace. Here's a lady mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. Yeah, I wanted to why y'all was dishing Jimmy. What kind of a phony accident is that? Danny, no phony accident. Yeah. Why you all were wanted this, Jimmy. Well, what are you talking about? You're talking to me? Yeah. Anybody that's successful in the wild. Today you are. Are you listening to what I'm saying? I'm talking about the callers. Rip it him in as and I'm done. Rip it him. What are you talking about? It's my son. You both on him down because he's black right. Not because he raped anybody or bit of guys. You're off because he's black right. Pull it out your ass bitch. We have an open line of day one and a. Broward five six seven. Find by the way, learn to speak somewhere where your place. Go learn to speak English. Would be good. Here's Boker. Hello. Yes, sir. Why you always be dish. Yeah, what's that great? I'm dish in some lunch up right now in my place. How is it? It's delicious. Rock and lunch. Which hopefully I bring my blood pressure down from 900 over 800. Thanks a lot, Dr. Mark. You're a genius, baby. You know, you want to read like that at the arena there for the goals. But, you know, those guys got a mortgage to pay down. Yeah, you're right. That's what Mr. Boat has said. In fact, you know something lately. Every time I see him, I don't see the Boatine. Or maybe they had a pawn as coalition to Boatize. I think he probably had to sell off a few of them to make laughs. Once payment. Probably. Maybe they're raising the money to see if they can get Paul Bell boring. I tell you what. This Jimmy saying we have everybody has a story. Everybody thinks they know what's going on. It's not amazing. All these people got caught with their pants down. Open up a big mouth. I'm coming in this morning. And all these experts both on the air and the colors. That's that. And they're talking up a storm like they know something. Hank calls in here 20 to 11 and just unmasked all of them and makes them all look like a pile of crap. You think they've learned, you know, time and time again. Hank's done this to all the all the people in the newspaper. It was all the media. Because Hank knows all the principles involved and he gets his information directly from those people. And this doesn't just shouldn't read some stupid thing that some irresponsible Zack has wrote in the newspaper. I mean, they'd be better off just to wait for Hank to give his report and then write it the next day. Yeah. At least it would be. No, that doesn't kill enough good airtime. At least it would be accurate. Right. Okay. Now you're not taking your feet on the ground. Keep your head in the clouds. All right. Uh, we have an open line at Grower's five. So how you always did you know, I'm a gym and jazz. I didn't know Jimmy Johnson was black. Did you? Did you know that? No. What is that kind of? Did it with Mike Tyson? What one? What should he be talking about? Does anybody out there know? No. I'll be in other shape. I think was that Mike Tyson thing that Carter Sarkotic. He's a scumbag, okay? A scumbag. It convicted rapists and a piece of crap. And a lot of idiots are going to go out there. A lot of morons and pay 50 bucks to watch him beat up some bum in the shed. They're out there at DMGM Grand. And it's pathetic. And all I can tell you, man, all I can tell you, that no-for-fact is that the American fucking way. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, Mr. Rogers. Yes, I am. I have a problem like you have with the blood pressure. And I had seven podcasts on my heart in 96 before he was on the sex. And was put on blood pressure medicine. I was able to take myself off of that due to actions and garlic. Yeah. They can fresh garlic in the morning. Like maybe a clove of and chop it up in the face. Yeah. And it lowers that blood pressure that distal after 10 to 70s. When I go off, I have to travel. Shoot right up. So I just want to let you know. And I enjoy your show very much. Thanks a lot. My best advice though is don't stop taking any prescription medication without using your brain. Even if your doctor tells you to do it. Just get a second opinion. Like George says. One of the worst moves I've ever made. Thank God. I got enough of a brain to bring my little blood pressure thing in here this morning. And that Adelaide pill just in case. As I said to myself, what if I go in there? Because when you're working, obviously your first is going to go up. And I've been taking this particular medication along with one other one for like two years. And doing very well on it. And what if I go in there and don't take it? And then suddenly my pressure goes skyrocketing, which it was. And I don't have anything. Of course I wouldn't have known anyway. Yeah. Another stroke of genius. Nice gone, you know. I think George may have the best idea about this whole thing. You know what I'm saying? Okay. The second opinion. Here's a Providence Rhode Island. Hello. Are you doing? Okay, sure. It's a tough thing that's often seen up there. Because you've got to rely on some second-hand information. Well, down here, there were a lot on 10-10 information. Bob. So I'm going to call them. That's true. I'm glad to hear him when he report. Just curious. I mean, just to add another note, I mean, I personally think of Jimmy left. We'd be maybe not in the Shambles, but it'd be very tough to recover from that. I think we're moving forward. I, you know, that would be the worst thing for the team at this point. But my question being, I keep hearing. I searched the internet. I keep hearing. We need a big receiver, which I know we do a big running back. And we need help along the offensive line. But the thing is, how are we going to do this? Is he going to go out and get a big name free agent? I don't see too many big things. I think Schuillis is the best. We need to help. Okay, call one of the sports. You'll call a pan can talk about that. Okay, don't talk sports. We have an open line in Dave London, Rossi. You see the problem with this. There are two different aspects. It's a major news story in town, which is why I'm talking about it. And why we certainly are carrying the press conference. But on the other hand, the people I wanted to discuss all the internet sports ever see do it someplace else. I don't do it. And have no interest. Here's Miami. Hello. Hi, you're doing the. I'm a lot of interest. I've been using his just started and QM. So I got to listen to your. What my Catholic you know the talk. And the other day I was in my house. My Roman Catholic talk. Yeah, you know, the uh. Talk about this. In the ciudad. Right. Thank you. That's what I want you to play. And they show this moving culture judging. They go back in the church. They showed this movie called Judgement. I don't know if you heard of it. No, it's about the Frank. The Father Frank obeys story. And the father Franco Gay. Okay. Yeah, the whole story, you know, and then this kid at the end he gets a, you know, he gets on trial. He in the end. Yeah, he confesses, you know, about the end, you know, and then it says that he's still serving. They said that he's still serving time. So, you know, I just call you to see maybe you want to check them over your judgment. Yes, called judgment. Is it like a video on TV? I don't know. I'm sorry to nature. Okay. All right. I'll check it out. Okay. Thanks a lot. And don't forget about things like fact in this church. We had an, of course, you know, you see a bunch of guys running around and dress with a silly little beanie on. I mean, that's probably, you know, that's the way it ought to be. Open line of date five to end. Of course, if you had any questions about, you know, life or about marriage or about anything in general, I go see a guy on a dress every two five six seven, five sixty pump. What do you laugh in a vase? That makes sounds like a net perfect natural thing to me. Guess we better do a break. You know what I'm going to do, Joe, not that you care. I'm just telling you right out front. Let's do this. Spot from the next break because that breaks going to disappear. You know, I'm saying the one that's written in there. The rest of the break. Is that okay? Yeah. That's fine. Go. It's okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I feel like Dennis James is Dennis James dead by the way. Yes, Dennis James is that I liked Dennis James. You know, there was a lot of people I liked. They're all dead. The people I can't stand like will be goldberg. Oh, see there you go again. Why you be patient? Yeah, I'm vision that will be, which is not as good as making will be, but right up there. It's all tracked in the church. It started out the regular guy who joined this directory and made me ultimate sacrifice embracing celebration. It was happy and gay until he got caught by some saddled jail. Then the Vatican says everyone ought and he did not go to jail. Father who too. Dennis. But on his who. Father. They sent him to a free free tree where the genuflex and train. If it was you or if it was me, it'd lock us up and throw the keys away. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. How do you say Dennis? I'm a shadow without that. I'm a shadow without that. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. one guy in West and he's been guy in Key West was saying that oh West is what ever sender he was saying that it sounds like the reason the Jimmie Johnson would have left if he had left at all what was because of the family but not so sure that that's accurate i'm thinking uh... all the time that he has in the off season to be with his family that doesn't really go well with me what do you think i think it may be part of it you know but there's a lot more to it than that there's got to be a lot more to that you know what i think i think we'll wait and see what he has to say and see if it's credible enough it sounds like it makes sense yeah i think we all need to be a little patient around here i don't know i like those people with a big mouth in the morning all these colors calling you know ready to put them up on a cross and let's uh... you know burn the set and i'm fire amen you'll take care of it right there okay twelve thirty uh... let's see what this uh... in around eighty four that to save the least Jimmy Johnson a frustrating end of his season as he got his bang that dolphins to the post even humiliated thirty eight to three to hand to the franco reports everywhere said the jocelyn would resign today in eleven eight and three press conference well johnson had an early meeting this morning he went away and i think i'm a and then marino and apparently that is not the case that you see high thing earlier the small one pronto on the winter day over and jimmy johnson has a change of heart and he will not resign as head coach of the army doll's court and we'll stick around our hand over broke the way that you're joining uh... he did that was that a talk up or what and trying to evaluate what was going on jimmy said i know there were a lot of things during the season that were bothering him he's been troubled by the fact that coaching changed so much just in a couple years that he was out in that uh... it's difficult to deal with players uh... particularly the higher pay ones in terms of their responsiveness and uh... the second thing that bothers him was the uh... black monday when five coaches were fired and he felt that was unjust and it casts some negative feelings on a profession and his mind and the third thing was that he was not at all happy with the media in the way that they treated a lot of the stories this year particularly the week that damn arena through for four hundred touch down pass and jimmy didn't give him a lot of platitude to this post game press conference which is the local press made a lot of and the talk shows as well and i know i went into the jimmy's radio show that week and he was very concerned about that he said the means and one might supposed to do about this you know i'm if i say something they get me if i don't they get me so i think that was bothering him too well the number four has been very significant jimmy johnson's coaching career back at my am he threatened to walk he stuck around in his fourth year he won a national championship in his fourth year with the Dallas Cowboys he won the first of two super bowl championships now the path ahead is to try to get it done with the money dolphins in this his fourth year that will be coming up here meanwhile another surprise announcement happens this morning in the day to florida day one stat jimmy johnson's former citizen with the Dallas Cowboys who of course was five by the Chicago Bears on black monday a couple weeks back has been hired at the Miami dolphins a system head coach of the new johnson word has it and when the day does approach the jimmy johnson's step status head coach day one stat within a soon title of head coach of the Miami dolphins arrived back to my green bird now on the fp and new the time i'm not okay so i was just a little of their patting for time okay so there you and and well that was beautiful just like i said give Hank some credit and give Hank some credit so that's how you said hey stop in this guy but stop a little bit so we're still waiting for jimmy okay over there in davie florida and we have our people standing by it's really kind of sad that i'm sitting with do they have any idea i mean is a jimmy there are their bodies there no he's not there yet couple more minutes well a couple more than it's what was he gonna fall through the ceiling in a couple minutes he's gonna like spontaneously appear like spontaneous generation i think he's a little bit of ground he's one he's gonna bust through the sod yeah like like an apparition like the virgin married arroz alo pisses house i was yesterday this is today and with that movie okay maybe we just squeeze another call or two here because it's any moment now it's what more at any edge i'm excited about it no here's a mobile and palm beach show yeah hey Neil yes sir this has got all the earmarks of a full hand rest yet yeah it's gonna be the next set coach right one of these something if we had still Henry on the phone doing jimmy's voice i would really be a one i'm waiting for Brian toxic coming in say suck up yeah is he gonna be that coach him in one set funny you should mention that could i think i just saw his post on a screen whoo Brian toxic was saying so much to something like that number 51 that coach do you had coach in my head all right Brian and Eddie Javanoski do you need to Jackson over there are Q1 they're uniform but anyway so there's still pattern for time and thank god they got more than Michael Jackson's stuff he didn't know he i'm a but i should Michael Jackson Michael Jordan Michael Jackson saying complice you know at least Michael Jordan got a better haircut and a better nose where we gone here's a mobile in Kendall hello hey yes sir how's it going great this and two things one i am gonna see the mic type the pipe but it's because i'm not paying for it i got to the evil box okay and the support here of the eye or nearly on the ear you know i always have to say that the how would the evil box and it's a very evil thing but in this case it's aifiable yeah and the second thing is i was driving out of palm metal i saw a car with a big dent on the side and it says with a bumper sticker Jesus watches over me i saw he must have blink oh yeah how to go near well he does not we do a good job you know he's busy doing a lot of stuff we have two open I like you know all these football games like i've always told you about this but what is that? it's a welcome a great addition to our coaching staff someone with eyes help us alone for a long long time somebody that's going to help us take that next step and that's they wants that they've they've and i coached together at various places at University of Pittsburgh local on the state University of Miami Dallas Cowboys and he comes in as my assistant head coach and when i say assistant head coach i don't mean like they have on a lot of staff a token a assistant head coach he is truly the assistant head coach in that and whenever maybe i'm not in mobile like at the senior bone next week i'll be there for a few days if i'm not there the whole week he will take the role as the head coach when i'm not there same thing whether i'd be our meetings here or at any anapolis on and on going back three years ago i made a statement that i was going to do everything in my power to bring a championship to the Miami Dolphins in three years i can honestly say that i gave everything that i had a total commitment to make this team the very best that it could be although i'm disappointed that we didn't win a championship i am encouraged that we are very, very close i really believe that that would allow us to win a couple more games during the regular season which would allow us to have a buy in the playoffs which would allow us to be able to be at home for the playoffs and have success so i think we're really close a month ago i've started a very trying period my mother passed away and we went through some times where in all honesty it opened up my eyes as far as me realizing that i needed to spend some time with people that i care about as you all know coaching is not a nine to five job we go through seven or eight months of 15 hour days and i went through that for about 34 years in my early days it uh... calls me spending time with my two sons it calls me a marriage and i could see some of these things happening and i could say when mother died i realized i really needed to spend some time with people that i care about ronda wrote maker in myself with plan on getting married i wanted to spend time with her and so looking at all this i didn't see a way that i could juggle everything spending time with people i cared about and yet fulfilling my responsibility to make the money dolphins the best they could be a visit with Wayne hyzing this morning and let me tell you what for people that don't know he is a special individual we have got great people here with my and the organization great people with the dolphins and it all starts right there with Wayne we visited that link and i talked about Dave and he said you know Jimmy he said why is it you can't just bring Dave in and it will allow you some time for ronda and your family and yet you've got the quality of someone that you respect as much as not more than anybody in the national football league to fill your shoes on those days that you're not there and the more we talked the more it made sense i really think it's going to be a great addition for the money dolphin to and let me assure everybody of this my determination and my commitment is not one bit less than what it has been before if anything else i think there's more resolved there to get the championship to the money dolphins i think we have strengthened our staff i think we have strengthened this organization and again i think there's even more resolved to make this team one not better not only did Wayne spend time with me but it it was important that all the people in the organization the assistant coaches everybody from stoo to and everybody and then even Dan marino came up and then said i'm with me at length this morning and he said co-cheese said we are so close we're really close to getting to where we want to be and i think you know just the feeling of everybody made me realize that i could you know do what and accomplish what i wanted to accomplish in both areas and i did talk around a few minutes ago and and she's excited about me staying the only thing she said was just because you're staying i'm not letting you off the hook you're still marrying me and so and so i'm excited about it i think it's great for the money dolphins and i can answer your questions later on but now bring up day once then assistant hate coach it's great to be back in the dolphin organization hopefully this time will be along the stage and the first for some of you who might not be familiar with i'm talking about i was totally hard meat when i was at the university my amy got hired on here as the lineback of coach for seven weeks before ending up in Dallas with Jimmy but seriously it's it's there's a very exciting time for me to be involved with a great organization with a great owner and Wayne a man who's permitted to do what it takes to to be the best it's exciting to be to be back with Jimmy someone who i respect you know as on a professional level on a personal level and we've got an awful lot of success together over the years as he's mentioned and and that's the plan here to to get that done as far as getting back into stock floater you know living here when i coach at university my amy my wife and kids are excited about about the opportunity and the challenge ahead last late you know my my responsibility and what i'd bring to the table my commitment will be to do whatever i can do in any area to make the dolphin better and to get to where we all want to get right i'd be for the coordinators Georgeville nothing has changed there hippie browns are offensive coordinator and as i said before Dave is truly the assistant head coach and uh he will be involved in meetings just like i'm involved in meetings there may be times in table being involved with setting in with the offensive meetings while i'm sitting in with the defensive meetings uh our vice versa back and forth but this does not upstairs anybody on our staff George Hill has done a tremendous job is a great football coach and i assured him that you know Dave coming in is really working with me more than he is with the defense and George welcomes it he said hey Dave and i know each other well he said Dave is a great football coach and he said you know i look forward to Dave having input to what we're doing so i think this is the real positive and and again uh as far as our staff uh George Hill and hippie brown uh both remain coordinators well the biggest thing again is uh the the feeling that i had was it's hard for me to juggle both roles and and have time for my family which is very important to me and something that i'm going to do and yet have a total commitment to the Miami Dolphins there will be times that i won't be here 16 hours a day uh and in those times Dave is going to be working as the head coach here's sometimes i love personnel and i love you know being able to put together the product and so there's no way in the world that i'm going to miss any of that uh and i think that uh we can pull out my expertise in certain areas and then we can add to it with Dave's expertise in certain areas but it's for is uh the feeling that i had it's for maybe not coming back uh ronda not spent a couple days in the keys uh here the first part this week and and that's when that was and then when i was able to work out the total uh total program was this morning. There's no room for you to sign or setting on it. No i i never did actually do anything along that line but that because you know the first time i had an opportunity to meet with uh Wayne was this morning. Do you hear anything about a valley with a silver size here and you accept that? i don't think uh i don't think any of this included myself can speculate for us what might have happened uh it didn't happen and uh again and i want to make sure this is very clear to everybody you know my commitment and my resolve and you know my efforts is not they are not diminished not one bit and if anything uh with another person here that i care about uh i feel even more responsible to get into job done. Do you think was there a contact extension from no? No. No if this has nothing to do with contractor anything like that and so that was that was never even discussed and we had wanted this go. Do you know what's the one that you would need that talking about this? Do you think somebody got a number of the dead of the work? Oh David i talked uh i think we've probably had conversations at least once a week for the last uh 10 or 15 years right and i'm not exaggerating uh he's one of the few people that i do talk to i i'm not much of a telephone person as anybody in this room that's ever tried to call my house might know um i i could said i don't like talking on the telephone but there are a few people uh my family my sons days and occasionally no a fernor and that's about the only phone talk i've ever had. Did he was right down this way when you walked in it and what was the one that's left there? Who could be staying or be going behind me? Well well there was some uncertainties in that Wayne hard me to do a job and he he hard me in a certain role and i had reservations about going to Wayne in the middle of the stream and saying wait a minute because of what i want to do with my family and because i'm getting married and because uh the time that i want to spend with my father or who's after he's finishing chemotherapy is coming down here in a few weeks because of those things my role has changed and and so it's hard for me to uh to go to him and say i don't i i don't want to do these things i want to change it around and to Wayne's credit we've worked through all of these things that were we can accomplish what we want accomplished. Do you mean i will be in a negative role when you just stepped out? Well that happened when you take their own lives and go or i don't think we can speculate about that i don't know what's going to happen when that day comes uh and i think it would be foolish and i think it would be wrong for us to say what was going to happen. Only thing i want to happen right now is i want to win a championship and i want to win it this year. Jimmy football has been living a big part of your life i will use the A-woo-woo. Yeah i'm stealing and you obviously stepped back. Who know i mean i stepped back another hour but at least my plans are to try to spend more time with my future wife and with my father and my two sons. i'm going to go out of my way to spend more time with him because in all honesty and and don't get me wrong i don't regret doing anything that i did i don't look back and say i wish others on this or i wish i have done that but i can learn from what happened in those first thirty four years or so and i think that i can be a better football coach i can be more relaxed i can be more upbeat and positive if i have a good family life and uh and people you you talk to coaches around the league and they say well you know first comes uh my religion and in second comes my family and in third comes football and yet they work at football 15 16 hours a day seven days a week well that tells me football was first you know and they go to church for an hour a week so and they're with their family two hours a week so it looks like to me it was football you know a little bit of family and a little bit of religion you know and that's how it tells me what your commitment is and my commitment is going to be the same as for his getting us to a championship but i will try to spend a few more hours with my family if you're writing your info down the screen with the post you not for the professional writer you know you're trying to talk to one of your people you well it takes time and you know i i don't want to stand here and say you know what was here and what we had to do i only thing i can say is this you know we we improved three straight years we we were able to uh take a team and right now we've got a young talented team we'll have more money under the cap next year then probably anybody in the league uh we've got 43 or 4 players under contract right now on 15 more tenders we've only got two starters they're not under contract we've got to make some decisions almost two starters we're in great shape as far as the talent of this football team and and as far as what we can do so this is not like uh a section of 15 this is a playoff team that advanced one notch in the playoffs i expect us to advance again you know i was all prepared to say this morning that you know people should not be disheartened because the best thing in the world is the be the coach that follows Jimmy Johnson asked Pat Jones that went to Oklahoma State or look up over to Oklahoma State or asked Dennis Erickson that won a couple of championships that Miami RF very switcher who won a super bowl of Dallas so i wasn't the worst thing in the world to follow me you know but uh for some of you you have me for at least one more year all right we need a couple more playmakers on i'll think i know that and Dan and i talked about it this morning we know that yeah and you know i defend our people you son because they are our people but we know we got to get better in a couple of areas no they will not be coaching the position and it will not be a coordinator he'll be assistant head coach he will he will work with all three areas off-ends defense special things just like i did who got the head set on Sunday i will both have hit their phone talking to the coordinators who knows yeah did you pick up the papers this morning Edwin you probably wrote something you know i don't know i can't say what's gonna happen a year from now i can't say what's gonna happen 10 years from now who knows i mean you know you may be stuck with me forever i don't know all i know is i know what i'm gonna do this year and i'm gonna coach like the Dickens to get us a champion and one of you have this kind of restarters and something that's always been triggered in your heart is that i have to do this for me when i went when i went to mother's funeral i i they had the viewing the day before and i wasn't able to do that and my sons were there and you know you know that there's time that you pull back and you say hey be with some people that you care about and don't short change them they care about you they love you there's a port even everything that you do give them just a little bit back and that's what i found on the only reason we had a schedule is because it's what my contract was three years who knows what's gonna happen three years from now you know i can you know i can say that we're gonna win this or win that no one can only thing we can hope for i can hope that we're gonna win a championship in three years but the only thing i did know and i i i truly believed in my heart was that we would be better and i think we were better oh finalizing everything this morning yeah i told him that i'm happy to tell you that day and and that's and yeah again a lot of this has to do with Wayne because Wayne's smart enough person to see that this can work and i think Wayne knows me he understands me he understands my belief in what date and edge of the table and and saying hey i'd like to see this work so a lot of credit goes there a lot of credit goes to eddy jones if anybody in their life they have somebody that they value as being a really good a really good person well you know someone like eddy jones and eddy and i talked about it last night we talked about day of last night and so that's where the process started you know that i wasn't gonna take a year off i was gonna coach and right and my conversations were really what opportunities might be present for me from a coaching benefit it really had nothing to do with me taking time off yeah yeah i said oh long you're dead and and as i told him this morning i said dana said we're in position right now that we've got to be as strong enough football team that we can win without you having a great day and there's gonna be days that you are going to have a great day like you did against dimbur on that money night game and that's going to be a bonus and there's gonna be times we're gonna need for you to do that but we have to strengthen this football team hello this is on this is not a tumor it's the one to two hours well all right okay 1258 at five sixty wc i'm there here give me Johnson's press conference with Dave wants that and i'm just wondering we'll talk about a woman come back after the break i'm wondering about some of the egg on the pushes some of the assholes i heard on the air this morning this is five sixty you a yeah can you Burn, burn, where we were about to take our lives Find a exclusively well-ridden mine uses all the pieces we had in life Burn, burn And the way need, makes, dig and step closer We'll define our repüler All the materials we've set up down Do you let me charge, is it? Do you look to Safari or something? What's playing? One piece of a goat? Five, six, east, east, west, East, east, East,nd, south望 constant landice,رتars lifts lift lift top to land rivers, I don't know why I already have it. Paul, my last chapter of the WD Cream, we apologize for all the screeniest, I've been going on. But hey, we got a program director running around like a bulb would be in heat, which he's got a lot of practice. Anyway, so this morning, here are your two newspapers. Part for the course, once again, all the time smiley is out of the picture and the John Henry deal is final with the ballom. Now we move on to another piece of crap, okay? Front page of the stunt set in the Lupber left hand corner, J. J. to resign as Dolphin Ted coach reports say by Dave Hyde, why don't they front page not the front page of the sports section, they're front page of the front section. Here's the Miami Herald, right hand corner, lead story. And here's the presidential impeachment on the left hand with the pictures, but the lead story is always in the upper right hand corner. Of course, Johnson expected to quit Dolphin's by Armando Selguero, Yadi Adi, Adi, he'll report to the Dolphin Ted quarters today to resign. Not, not it's reported, wait a year this. Jimmy Johnson will report to the Dolphin Ted quarters today to resign after three seasons as the teams had coach. And a hastily prepared afternoon press conference, he's expected to cite family reasons for his departure. How do you like that? Is this unbelievable? And you see the problem with your news papers is they have a deadline. So they have to go to bed by 11 o'clock at night, midnight, one o'clock, whatever the hell at time is they go to bed. So for somebody to put this in the front page of the newspaper as usual, shows the ultimate, the height and irresponsibility, just unbelievable. Not it is rumored at least as some sentinel said Fox News was reporting last night that that's what was going to happen. But Armando said, General, right here in the here he will report to the center of the show. A lot of people would egg on their push today, right? Oh, who said it? Man, I like I said when I came on the year this morning, how about let's hear what he has to say? And especially after what he did have to say, and believe me, he was a little choked up there a couple of times. I ain't to break the news to you, but even for I know this comes as a shock. But even people who are football coaches and athletes and were a juxtap, even those people when their mother dies or their father dies or their mother dies and their father has cancer, these people actually put their pants on like at a time and have like living and breathing emotions. I know there comes this great shock to the sports nerds out there who never bother to think beyond what they the odds are on a game and did my team win for me to maybe feel good about myself. And the soil that I heard coming in here this morning, man, I'm going to tell you, it's just unbelievable, by both the colors and the people on the year. Spionless and gutlers and there's an ad, right? Don't even give the guy an opportunity. Don't even get to the real story. Thank God for Hank. Let me say it again. Hey, stop it. Few people when Hank comes out from Vegas and took off this afternoon, you ought to be in fact, this radio station when he comes back to town there to be kissing him all over the place. Well, not tough, but I mean, you know, seriously, they ought to be lined up at the door to meet you, greet the plane with a welcoming home party for the Humper. Because he's the one that finally, you know, talked to the parties involved in got the real story instead of just, you know, taking somebody at a face value or taking some report off of a TV newscast or something out of one of our local newspapers, which anyone should know better than that. It's like this paville brewery thing. Like I said, when I see it, I'll believe it. When I hear that it's a fader company and it's done, whether he's coming here, go someplace else, they're not believe it. So you can get his pissed off as you want with me about ripping our local newspapers. They suck. You can't complain about the journalism in his town because there isn't any. Just a bunch of overgrown kids like our mom, though, still Gerald and like a very jackass. And like, if somebody's other people, maybe a few years older and I'll know better, but they don't, which is why they're here. Very, very pathetic egg on the old post. And those of you callers out there, and I know most of you are still listening that called in this morning. And like I've told you a million times, I couldn't care less. I don't go to the dolphin games anymore. You know, if they win, fine, if they lose, but it's not an important part of my life. I just don't care anymore. I'm not into it. I get the free tickets, those club seats, the great seats. I don't use them. So I have no extra ground one way or the other. But as so typical man of this town, don't even give a guy a chance to listen to what he's got to say. And if I could tell you the number of radio, every station I've worked on has been like, does every news department rush to judgment. Let's go on. Every time there would be an incident that would happen in town. Like a major incident, people call on me. Well, let's start, you know, judging somebody on the ear. I won't do it. I've never did it then. I won't do it now. Let's start holding a mock trial on the ear. Like a router was doing with a jump in a, that's beautiful. Let's hold a mock trial. Let's convince somebody in the media. Only a jackass like a router, this isn't like that. Of course, we all know he's a jackass. But those people call in this morning with their venom and he's got less and spying less. And we knew he would do this. Well, guess what? Guess what? Wrong again. They don't, they have omelette on their face. I'm not talking about from the podcast and overshrew either. They have omelette on their face. Well, sure, there are probably some people with nine having omelette on their face. Maybe a few years ago, I'm not even more. But yeah, not just a, not just not even a scrambled egg, a big fat omelette all over their posts. They even look worth a little crater post today. Because they rush to judgment, because they believe the bullcraft in the newspapers, you think that after while you learn your lesson? You learn that when you read something in the local newspapers this time, you better check it and recheck it and check it again and again and again and again and again and then get a 10th answer. You're just like this, the George Tommy about go to a doctor to get a second opinion. Which I think he's got a, had damn good point. Because I mean, when somebody keeps putting something on a front pages of their newspapers, time and time again, because they're too cheap to go out there and get real reporters and they are a bunch of stringers and a bunch of prepubes and kids and pretend that these people are news people, how to help and they have any credibility. Just like I told you another day, Michael Jordan's got a reason. Well, when he and all was actually, this was when he and be a settled astrike. And they're enrolled because of their insect facilities in ship with Mickey Erson and the building of that needless arena there in downtown Miami, you recall the crap that they pulled with that bogus election and the role that the Tony Ritter played in there with Mickey Erson hopping into bed together put that one over in the public. So more important than the presidential impeachment, the big story leads to out of front page NBA settle astrike. It's quite the fact that most people said we don't give a crap. Here in there everywhere else in America, that was the most important story. I mean, give me a break. The only thing these people are allowed to do is squeeze as much advertising out of those pages as they can and try to manipulate for their own profit. That's all they care about. For their own power and their own profit. That's why there's the non-grouped Miami that fits around the side who's going to do what and who's going to be where and who's going to control what and that's the other reason why you'll never have casino gambling in this town or in this state. Is because these people don't want to lose any of their power, any of their death grip that they got and everybody else. 11 after one is five sixty. And by the way, just mentioned this in passing because I know the really important stuff is over, but Henry Hide is opening up his big fat post right now. The impeachment of the president is the trial is beginning right now. We are blowing off your ass Henry. Go ahead and have an affair with somebody's wife. 12 minutes after one is fine if you can find it. I don't think you can find it anymore. You think you can find it? No. Some Jack. Bite me. I want to know if my ties will fight me. Okay. I hope you like me. You really want me. I'll be there if you bite me. 143 million. Now be a fourth. I'll then weigh over. It's beauty. One fourth. And Tyson can bite me. Like any mortgage. Four. The box here. Four. What's ever seen at five sixty? WQA. Oh, man. Exactly. So we did miss the Mike Tyson press conference. Where was that on? When did you see that? It was like a TV interview. They were sure on the highlight of it last night. Well, I was at the Maple Leaf Panther game. You think it would be watching that cramp. But anyway, to have it out of the he lost it again, we'll see in the and mothered her and the stuff like that. Here's a real cramp. You guys, I hope you enjoy your 50 bucks. Maybe you have like one of those, you know, illegal decoders like that earlier guy. Because in this case, we certainly will hardly approve because it's worth it. It's twice the price. Here's South Miami Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Oh, you know, you mentioned Tyson, you know, the Holyfield Real Deal. That's what the Holyfield calls himself, the Real Deal, right? Yeah. So, you know, Tyson wanted to know what the Real Deal tasted like, right? Yeah, and moving along, sir. Well, anyway, but you want to be proud of the, um, do you think about Jimmy Johnson? What I can't understand, you know, we live in a town to closely Cuban, right? He said a real people with their, uh, Santa Lea. Okay, have a nice day, pal. Jack asked two open lines in date, five six seven. Oh, five sixty and five sixty on the 18th. The Cuban set a real people. I think this guy's been choking the chicken too much. Maybe he's probably we have that interview, apparently. With one, red to go. The mic, Tyson. Okay, let's hear it. Mike, uh, Francois, both are six to one on the dog. Are there any concerns in your part? I don't know anything about that. I don't know nothing about number of ice in the middle that I can do. How about show this mother? Okay. How about the 19 months off? Is what about it? Is what about it? Does the polls any problem for you? We'll see. I doubt it seriously. You take into the ring a lot of rage. Does that work for you or does it work against you at times? No, who can't win a fight anyway? What does it matter? Well, for example, rage against the other than the Holyfield work against you. Well, f***ing, you're the fight. So, whatever happens happens, Mike, why do you have to talk like that? Well, I'm talking to you the way I want to talk to you. You have a problem, turn off your station. You know what? I think we'll end the discussion right now. Can we could? You got it. Have a nice fight, Mike. I'm the type of guy with a big squished head. I win all my fights except the ones that I'm the type of guy. I found him like a big thing and showed him that he's short and it's boxing really deep. I'm the type of guy who always is a bird. I show Carl Williams that the truth can really hurt your the type of guy that sinks in on the form. So, I just said you that you are the U.S. He dumb. I'm the type of guy with my even and my bobbins. I only lost my fight and the biggest man with robins. I'm the type of guy who makes the people laugh and put them in down. You know, I'm the type of guy who makes the people laugh just because I keep all my charging donkeys in care. I'm the type of guy and the public just attacked me and if you don't believe it then you had better ask me. I'm the type of guy that's what I'm giving to the people. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. I'm the type of guy. What's the type of guy that you're in? You go fancy guy. Real piece of human dress. Okay, what do you think? Here's the fact that one of our real chronic facts is who says understand your obligation but to take terminal interview you can't hear the questions. Well, you know, that's the way I call it. That's why I hate press conferences because number one, first of all, most of them are with people that we don't want to hear from anyway who have nothing to say. And number two, you can never hear the questioners while the reporters and the media people out there and the audience including somebody in the back of the room. And so it's really, really bad radio. But in this particular case, I mean, it's an awful station. It's a humongous story. It was on the front pages of both our major newspaper this morning. You're runously incorrectly reported incorrectly reported night's going. Oh, my god, the egg on your face news papers, baby. I'd be embarrassed. I mean, I'm embarrassed enough to work here. But I'd be embarrassed to work at one of those newspapers. Even if I was just delivering it, if I was the paper boy, I'd be embarrassed. I'd have to hide my head and shave. I have to wear a schemas, give me more and take it out and deliver the goddamn papers. Let's somebody recognize me. Here on a Delta rated beyond the shadow of a dog. That's what it is. Non stop. Here's Miami Beach, yellow. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Howard, I was watching the press conference and the media's out like Jimmy, let's speak it from the heart, especially when he said talking about his mother. He got choked up. I mean, that's totally up. You know, a lot of, I mean, like I said, I hate to break the news to people. He's a guy. He's, you know, he's not some kind of a, some kind of an automaton machine. Yeah. And he does have a mother and a father and he did. Does have a live well. He did have a one. But you know, I thought he showed a lot of balls when he still coast that Denver game. And you know, a lot of people could say what they want, but I mean, he's the right man. Yeah, it's interesting. They were not getting them for that. I had a defendant for that thing. At least he showed enough dedication to the team that is much, you know, anguish as he was feeling. He still felt that that was such a big game and people expected them to be there and he showed up. That's right. I mean, you know, and then this town, you can't please these people no matter what you do. I've learned that the hardware over 23 years, but no matter what you do, you cannot please these people. It's never good enough. Yeah. And even if he would have loved and want to see his, you know, to be with his mother, oh, then he really would have gotten over that. But I would, you know, I mean, I'm like anybody else. I would have understood that this mother. Yeah. You know, but, uh, I'm glad you do. I understand this is Miami. He owes them something. Don't you get it? Yeah, I know. But I'm glad you here. You're at least, you know, uh, and you can just, I'm getting the phone. Okay. Have a great day, pal. You can see the handwriting on the wall's very obvious. I think what the deal is, he's going to move a coach for another year. Then he'll move upstairs and becomes GM and Juan Settel, move in become the head coach. I mean, he practically painted that right out there for you. But don't, I, G, don't say that because then, you know, I don't want to confuse those people to newspapers. Open line of day five, six, seven, five, six, six, the and pump five, six, the on the AT and T Wallace line. Maybe somebody out there has actually chronicled the ongoing series of done smiley erroneous articles in both newspapers in this town. Alan Snell in the Sun Sentinel and Buried Jackass in the Harold front page of the front section front page of the sports section. They after day after day, month after month after month and you really ought to say, these should be collected. That is, I should say these are front pages. Both morning newspapers said, you know, how people say newspapers from like, you know, VE day and Pearl Harbor day and things like that do we defeat Truman right exactly. I mean, this is classic soft Florida journalism at its very very bad. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Tell me one thing. How does one turn your TV off when you're getting an interview with a microphone on the dice? Do you hear that? Turn your TV off. He said turn your station off. He said, whatever. He's in a little bit jerk. What do you say? Yeah. Susan, Neil, you shed the light on me. I went to the Maple Leaf game. Yeah. I'm the guy to call it up with the kids that I want to apologize. I told him let's try it. Let's sit down. We only stood up when there were gold and really it was a lot. A lot nicer setting. I appreciate you. I apologize for all that. Walking Regulations. We had a real well behaved crowd last small crowd. Too many empty seats, but it was a damn good game. You got it. Okay. That lesson. What do you have against these bridge tenders? Okay. Oh, God. I prefer chicken tenders myself. We have an open line in the Broward 567.05. 60's amazing. I'm much better. I feel nice. They've got the red portion everything will be hot push. But boy, not that my blood pressure is not normal and I'm still alive. So thank you very much. Neil, for having enough common sense to bring in your own stuff and you're not listening to anybody else out there because you're very easy to talk literally about other people's health. You know what I mean? Very easy just to be all you'll be fine. You're okay. You're never still afraid to rain. Have a nice life. You'll be. And then as I'm sitting here looking at that thing going up. I'm watching you know, you're almost watching that like the applause meter, like the fake applause meter that those arenas. 26 after one at 560 WCM Hank Goldberg will be here from Vegas. He's out there, of course, for the big fight. Bozo and Bozo out there is Saturday. And like I said, more power to Hank baby. God bless him. God bless America and God bless. Neil, God. And Hank Goldberg too for us to appendish you have today being the one person in America who instead of just listening to what Fox said and what this one said and what the Bozo said in the morning show this morning and the newspaper said, actually took the trouble to call the parties involved and get the real story. Right down to the bottom line. Jimmy Stan wants that's going to be the assistant. He's getting Mary do a what your name and that's it. Right there, all three points. Right on target Hank. Let's hear it for the hopper. We've got a It works the nourishing in the bars. Oh, but it does 132 at 560 WCM. We have an open line in date 560 70560 pound 560 on the AT&T Wireless line. Hank like I said from Vegas at 2 we got boost you very briefly at 6 because we got the pregame Panthers show at 630. Panthers and the Hurricanes in Carolina 7 o'clock very very gigantic big game tonight. And we're hearing more about Pavelle Brie today. Okay. Here's Boca. Hello. Oh, yes sir. You're beautiful, Nail. You're beautiful. Yes, I am. Hey, yeah, I have that taste and he had disgraced a what? Yes. Where and on the TV. He was coming back. He was coming back and he always will be a scumbag and like Hank said this morning they've had that deal cooked up for this fight at the MGM for over a year now and it was just they went through all the motions of this hearing and getting him his license back. Hey, you know it's just a dollar since it has nothing to do with anything else. He can do whatever he wants and there's still as long as they can make the big bugs they'll still use him. I thought he was a therapy though. Yeah, he's in therapy, right? He was a therapy. He should be a nice person. I mean, he was what was like Chi at Trissy. Well, guess what? It didn't work. Yeah, what do they call that anger control anger management the client that's what they call it now? Well, all these crazy jobs. Well, they need to go through anger management class. Anybody else they sure I'm going to guide them, you know, in the slamer for about five years for beaten up their women as these animals say. Oh, yeah, well, I beat up his woman because that's just that's a cultural thing, you know. No, we don't know. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. How are you doing? Okay. Neil, let me ask you a question. Michael Jordan had a press conference yesterday. You didn't show none of that. How come you showed Jimmy I showed it. Why did you see it? I was saying, well, you put it on the air. Yeah, because Jimmy Johnson is a local story with the dolphins, which is the dolphin station. And everybody in this town was on a front page of our papers here. And everybody in town cares about the dolphins Jimmy Johnson. Really? I swear it wasn't because he's white. Oh, that must have been because he's white. That's right. I forgot Michael Jordan's black. Thanks for reminding me, sir. Okay. Next time Michael Jordan is in the news. Be sure we don't put it on. Because he's well, that's why we talked about OJ so much because he's black anymore to two people. If he would have been white murder those same two people, we wouldn't have talked about them. What do we know? There you go. Michael Jordan's black. Oh, my god. Talk about paranoid. You're more paranoid than Jeff to forest. And that's that's the ultimate. That's the ultimate slap I can give you. Pell. You're more paranoid than default. Here's Miami. Hello. How do you do it? Yes, sir. Yes, I lost the look. I'm about to clown. Okay. Open line in date 567560 pound 560. Well, I'll tell you what thing. You're on your hot sauce today, baby. They're on the big jungle juice today. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I just called a community and thank for doing such a great job on a break of stories. Well, next to one did all the work. I just had to hear and took his call. That was great. But the fact that you had it covered. Yeah. We're not one else with whenever one of the other job of two composers. Yeah. And the fact is that I kept saying all day. How come how about we sit back and see what he has to say? Right. You know. Because I was ready to talk to composers like basically everyone else who's wanted to hear all this. Well, every name in the book. I don't hear anybody apologizing by the way. They're saying, oh, well, you know, maybe I could prematurely or maybe the media, you know, let me down the garden path. I don't hear any of these people with the with the cohones to call and say, well, I said the wrong thing. We're out of line. Right. That's what I mean. They just crucified this guy. They gave him a verbal lashing. And basically, for what? It's not I mean, did he do a bad job here? No. The last three years? No. Every year they won one more game. This year they want to play off game. And, you know, and then they got the crappy out of by a far superior team. I just wanted to call you and say, wait, it go. Oh, and. All right. Thanks a lot. Have a great day. Okay. What do you say? He said to put solution in your casket. We have an open line today. 567560 and pump 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Yeah. We didn't carry the Michael Jordan press conference because he's black. See, I guess I'm a like John Coniors from Michigan because he's light complex and black. That's why I like Malcolm on the young and a hornet. Real light black and just beautiful. How are you doing Malcolm? Where are we going here? Here's a mobile and that's probably why we don't like my touch. I'm sure we do dark. Mobile hour and a lot of them. Yes. What is it? Oh, me, yo. Yes. How are you doing? Okay. Listen, Neil. I'm one of those couple of weeks ago. You're asking for cropped over guys to listen to the first. The cropped. He's right. Yeah. Yeah. The cost of rest of the lessons to the music. Yeah. There you go. Anyway, I have that question. I've been listening to QAAM since about 10 this morning. Right. And the only thing I commend you. You're absolutely right with what you said about John. I've been listening to you all day. Often on all day. And the coolest thing is I didn't hear everybody cut and everybody up to me this morning. I heard of you. I heard of seven. No, I heard a few discurnal jet fans and a split discurnal marino. No, I'm not talking about jet fans. I'm talking about dolphin things. We're ripping my ass because I think I think that I'm just telling you when I heard when I was coming over. I'm making that up. Nobody said nobody's saying you made it up. I just said that when you talked about it that you only heard about a half hour to 40 minutes. Right. I think you know 35 or 40 minutes to get here. And when I'm and during the time that I listened, which certainly there was a lot of calls that came into an occurred time plus what John Deeple was saying. Most of what I heard was just a little bit of a constant and slicing. Yeah, but those guys, Joe and Deeple, listen if Deeple doesn't stare up controversy, he doesn't feel like he's a part of the show. I mean, they're great. I've been listening to him and I listen to you too. Yeah. And then I go right into hang. But I gotta tell you, every now and again, the media gets a little out of hand. Okay, have a great day. Thank you. Okay, thank you. We have an open line in the Broward 560 and about what is he laughing about? What is this man laughing about? Is anybody know? Oh, that is 15. He was driving on that. Our company said a reason for the chance of a heavy hit Avenue, accountability to someone liking's drives betterです, you've got the photo that I used to like headphones, pointer色 blockchuckles, and enjoy the good children. Before we lose our ethic, a Canada, a life that starts to rise. I know, I know, I know. I know, I know. I know, I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. I know. What's going to be your last week? You got to be fine. Here's a great back from Nancy, a big Jim Mandage fan. Yeah. There's when you're giving Hank Goldberg credit for bringing the voice of reason accuracy, which he was today, maybe. It makes it also Jim Mandage. I heard his broadcast last night on Channel 10, saying that he thought that this man JJ would become General Manager and day one, so it would become at coach. Not entirely accurate, at least a better estimate of this situation. Right on, Nancy, who else in the world would say, well, you've fudge back. I love that Jim Mandage. I told you before, Jim Mandage has gone. And Hank, I tell you every day since I've been here, I would go homeless in the Hank until those awful press conferences. I'm not talking about today's press conference, but those are the ones that he made a joke about it this morning. And I just, I just can't deal with that. Please, after I get home, in fact, what I should do is call Hank here. We did call a producer and say, okay, I'm home now. Let Hank put on the press conferences. Because you can't, first of all, if you wanted to hear what most of these voices were saying, which I don't, but if you wanted to do, you can't hear what the questions are anyway. You can't call it, you can't hear what you're saying. I mean, what is that? But what it comes to really getting the story and put it where it's at, baby, there's nobody like it. Nobody likes that. I'm not talking about that. That was funny. Here's a mobile in Weston, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Great. Hey, that was watching Channel Six last night on the segredo. We should have seen his face. And he actually said, I just confirmed this, if you literally, you know, Jimi Johnson is with. Uh-huh. Nice going, Tony, you jackass, you silly. I told you he's a silly goose. Oh my god, it's before he's better one, but the Michael Jordan thing, who cares? Yeah, I love money anyway. No, we already knew that. It was no surprise there. I am, what did he have to say? He's going to spend time with his kid and have a great life here on the great, good luck to them. All right, Neil. Thanks, man. Have a great day. So you loved Michael Jordan or you're indifferent about him or maybe you hit him like poison. But what was there to say? Nothing to say. It's just another stage media event so that he could kill a lot of the time and make a big song and dance and try to stuck some viewers in there because, you know, I mean, the only other thing that's going on is the impeachment trial of the president. I mean, that's not important. Is it? Okay, so I forget about that. Open line and date 567560 and Tom 560 on the 18T wireless line. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey, yeah, how's it, buddy? Yes, sir. How about Hank and Hank, huh? Yeah, he, he, I'll hanged up a good one today. He should be, let me ask you a question. I know what you see if you grew me on this time. If I'm just don't get right with this situation in it. It does not, right? It doesn't, it doesn't seem to me. Maybe you can agree with this degree. I don't really understand this. Yeah. Okay. The reason is best friend down. You know, assistant head coach, job. Okay. He slaps the media with all, he's going to quit or whatever or the room is going on. You know what they do is any kind of money. Well, wait, wait, wait, wait. How do you know he started the room as they were going on there? The room was that they didn't quote him. They quoted people of the assistant coaches and people in the organized way. What about, what about, what is father? His father said that he was going to retire. He had heard his father now. He didn't quote his father, lie or you said that. Yeah. He didn't call anybody a lie. He didn't call anybody a lie. That's true, but I mean, he don't think that there's no money involved. I mean, it regards to where his best buddy comes down here. And he gets the assistant head coach job. Yeah, you know, in other words, you don't think Dave Wants that is qualified as that where you're saying that. Oh, I'm saying he's not doing that. So what is the point? Maybe how about if Dave Wants that came down here coach for free? Would that make you happy, sir? No. OK, thank you. We have an open lot of people. I said, like I said, they're just they're all looking for an angle. There's something mysterious. There's something bizarre. Always questioning. I'm not like I told it before. You cannot come to this town and do good. That's not sufficient. You must have an ulterior motive. You must be basically a real son of a bitch. You must, there's got to be something behind it all, OK? Because generally speaking, whoever you are and whatever you do, we don't like you. One open line of Dave Wants in Broward, 560-50560 on the AT&T wireless line. Mobile in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. Any meal, one journal. Thank you back to you. I haven't probably do. I'm not that good as you. But anyways, I've been in the league a couple of times. You've been near the lake, qualmeler. No, I have not. I've seen Mario Cuomo on TV many times, but... OK, there's a good movie. I've seen Perry Coyne, I was very trying to sing. Life is beautiful, the Italian movie, you've seen it? No. Herd it's great, I saw it. No. Very good. And I just want to put my two cents about Jimmy John. Yes, sir. I mean, I've followed sports, but it's not my life. I really don't care if he's here. He's not here. I mean, I'm not in the hospital. I mean, this is not the end of the world and these people that are going off the deep end like Dan LaBanter and the woman I called weeping on the ear and the morning show this morning like this is the end of the world. I mean, like you said, it's sports, keep it in perspective and get a goddamn life already. It's like my good Jordan, I enjoy watching. So big deal, it's a good and changed by life. I really wish that is monstole. I mean, fun. And yes, I want to hate to break the news to these people. He plays in Chicago anyway. He doesn't play here. A couple of games a year. He plays here. And then he doesn't play here. Maybe a game that I want to weekend on television. That's it. I think he should get back far, but Italy. OK, have a great day. I would be bored. I would be bored. What open line in the day two and a row or five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty. I'm still waiting for these people to retract their disgusting, protests comments from this morning. I know you're out there. You're not fooling me. All you assassins, you ought to sign up with Peter Bolzer, you ought to get into radio business, all you. All you jackasses that we're calling this morning and this other guy to tell, well, you didn't hear that. I heard it 35 or 40 minutes mostly. There may be one or two exceptions. Mostly nonstop attack. Vicious attack. And I don't know. I don't know. Am I satellite guy? Oh, Mohammed. He also put up a couple of satellite dishes for Jimmy Johnson. Always just told me he's a good guy. Like some a lot. So I don't know anything about him personally. He impresses me as a hard ass when it comes to the media. And I said that before. But I don't care one way or the other. It doesn't make any difference to me. But the kind of vicious attack in the, he's got less and spinal ass than two phased in a turn called, yeah, I guess what? He ain't going anywhere. Oh, that's why they're all dummy to up right now because the catch got their tongue. Because that's what happens when anybody can open up a big mouth when they don't know what they're talking about. And that's one of the things I've bitched about on this radio station is we got a lot of guys, especially, and don't even mention the word hockey and most of these other shows. Because they don't know what they're talking about. You're not fooling me. Maybe you can fool some of the dummies, the bodies that you up out there at the macarine. You're not fooling me. I watch more hockey games in an average week that most of these assholes on this station have watched in their lifetime. And that's the truth. Went to the Panther game last night at a league game. Come home, watch the rest of the Pittsburgh Phoenix games. Flip over and watch some of the duck games. I want other games that I watch a, like four games in one night at least bits and pieces, including one game live there, which is a great game last night at the arena. Leaks to the Panthers. And got people on here. Fuck that, that's not going to be that little, tworp assucker there in the morning. But that, that, that, that, you know, same things that are so patently ridiculous. Like this Peter or else stuff. Oh, I don't know what I'm talking about. That's right. That's why he's in a minor league right now, okay? Cause he's not a freaking player, which is what I've been telling you day after day, week after, after week. On by the way, Chris Wells, he's injured again. He can't come back yet. He pulled it again and is going to. Oh, boom, boom for his ass. Just a minute, it's from Boko, Palm Beach, and Avancura America's largest Lexus facility is acres of pure Lexus luxury hand. You're very fast Lexus.
