OK now Neil Rogers on Sports Radio 560 QAF Oh Neil my queen Go How I love the little clip and that is why I become a singing but the unknown If they're very castor when we're so impressed with what I done the AAP action with her son Oh and you can see, for their families that's just someone's number one The time I was on Nunner You're just found a way to make some passion hope to roll your people up because You're fired Nunn's don't get none I never made it that because I didn't look that great so I got the onion head It's too in drugs and getting way Had my one and only hit the center that it can get the folks that there's my big Now that I can reveal how much I wanted Sally to go whistling in my wee You know Why do you hate that man so much? Why would you do that? I already had remembered that even my age my old Speaking of drugs by the way, I don't want to talk about that yet So let me forget to talk about that I had a bizarre I had a weird I had a strange experience yesterday Woo! I mean well we'll get to it So George comes in here rushing in here why do you hate rumors so much? Why do you despise him? You ask me to remind you that's not the question I understand why what this says But why do you despise him so intensely for the same reason that most other people do is Sure, yeah, no seriously why do you hate the man he's cheap? He's arrogant Yeah, cause and he's stippin' me on the agenda that he promised Got me some crappy seats at the air Canada center I'll tell you then Really really bad suits his wife is a wonderful his wife is a sweetheart That's the only reason I like you were asking me the other day why everybody asked you why does Neil associate with Jeff Rimmer? Because his wife is a sweetheart I love his wife Seriously, she's one of the nicest people I've ever known in my life She's an ancient what yeah whatever that means But he you know he is what he is he can't help it you know he just is what he is But he got me really crappy seats with we could use some binoculars in there I will come back by the way because toward the end of the show yesterday, which we were abbreviated Because of that wonderful Marlem game yesterday I've gone hey, Eddie, you think leave on come on two games this year? No, I don't think so Just toward the end of that show when we find to get a little bit of response Absolutely incorrect you jackasses that were calling in there toward the end Well, you're always bitching out people that I've never said that people don't chew up at the macarina In fact all year long I've been saying isn't it amazing how lucky Wayne got with this deal Especially since his stock is down to lucky eleven and what is it? Is that thing about that republic stock that they finally gave Wayne a check because times are getting tough 11 nine The market goes up almost 200 points yesterday the Dow And auto nation closed yesterday eleven dollars ninety three and three quarters cent I'd be like that I like it What did a new rate What that was I talking about before getting to Wayne remember? No, I wasn't talking about him you were talking about him at length About the the people that show up and we've had great attendance all year long What I have been asking right from the beginning is why are these people here? And I asked that question yesterday and didn't get the response that thought I should get you know something I didn't get the response you don't want to know why because they don't know what they're doing there They're killing time and the point that I'm trying to make is that when you kid more and when you price the average fan out Even in a place that's hockey crazy or sports crazy whatever the sport like be like Toronto with the hockey And you wind up with all these other people in there you say these aren't the people that we used to have come to the games These are people that aren't just sitting on their hands. They're reading a goddamn book. They're in a coma They don't know what they're doing here And the same in a macaroon and no wonder I didn't have anybody respond to that question because they could if you held a gun to their ear head They couldn't tell you what they're doing there And people like that are the ones who are passing the stuff around and when getting on their cell phone Plastic posers. That's what we got. We got a PP stadium And we also if you just change it into you know keep it simple. Let's make it PP arena plastic posers Is what we mostly have in the macarooner. Oh, look. I'm here They're like I said yesterday they're waving a people across the way and there's nobody waving back, but they're waving as if somebody really pays It gives a crap that they're there Not to go into a big song and then to get about the people sitting in front of us about to have it does nothing Mommy and daddy and grandma and grandpa and the 17 kids and what and holding them up in the air and waving and anything they haven't excused away Something in front of your face just to make sure you can't see what's going on And that's why most people don't give a crap of that's going on or not whether they can see the goal like come on They're not there for that. They're there to pose. They're there to see and to be seen That's what it's all about And assholes like that are the ones that destroyed for the very small. I don't know what percentage is now those of us who we'd go to see and event whatever it is That's my point And that's why I'll sell second the emotion that I voiced yesterday if only one it says it just like default and I Scallon our default find a gross small pair of last two days Tell these assholes about that that NFL draft garbage These draft nix these these no life low-life jackasses that think that this and event that you'd require more than 30 seconds of their interest Who gives a crap Oh, yeah, but in lucky says the bird's gonna draft the quarter man. Who cares about the bears? How many bears fans that we have here Six how many sand Diego fans we got here one But it's another risk use it's another event. It's another hype job and people just all get sucked into a man people with no life They get sucked into it. Oh, it's something to do something exciting. Why is it exciting? Well, everybody said it was Greg read by the way has a cracked coxess Okay, I say that on the air. No, okay. Greg read has a crack I guess that makes it worse. He does this man. You know the word slum-ozzle if you ever heard that word Slum-ozzle is the editor who word that if you look it up in the yeti dictionary Greg weeds picture is next to it He had mono last week over the week before for like a long time spreading the disease around now. He's got a cracked Cox's Because they had a little accident at the pool whore sing around with the kids together. They're trying to be you know overgrown child again Trying to be something he's not like you know like a broadcast dude. That would also be something he's not I shall amazil He brings me a letter that was it came in this morning W2QM is the address Sent to Sheridan Street by the way are we on Sheridan Street anymore? No, why it's been a bottom month They've been off his Sheridan Street for these that people are a little slow and I'm the part of the envelope Greg read Take a look at this take a look at this handwriting postmarked Broward by the way Probably somebody over the age oh It says get rid of Neo Rogers and it's spelled C. Ronni a Sam we know you wrote it even Greg said this Sam wrote this state letter We're on the same you know how we know it's spelled with a D ROD G E R S like that add in the Marlins opening day a program Get rid of Neo Rogers put about of his misery the low life that listen to him will not be missed the numbers that listen to him must be sick of him too No name no nothing just Crackly old nasty hateful miserable scrolling handwriting so if you just sand the sham Or it's some old fart and Broward some miserable all the disgusting part who is listing right now By the way just like the asshole that called the worst in this morning calling it about Kristina moron is leaving Which we already knew that? Doing everybody a public service and this guy calls in now I should have known right off the bat that this guy was a major asshole. Oh We're sure that I miss Chris moron. I was broadcast If there are hockey fan in the world that would miss Chris moron the broadcast No somebody who refuses to describe the game. No, no But this guy obviously knows nothing about the sport like most people here and then he goes that about well Opportunity for guilty and he has to throw in the gratuitous shot well I hear they want a Neo Rogers, but he's not of the right persuasion to broadcast those hockey games Well, I have bad news for you sir because I'm gonna be doing the Panther games next season How do you like that? So blow it out your ass mister Neo Rogers will be doing panthers hockey next season here on WQA Markets up 35 the NNZX up 22 I don't know why you hate rumors so much just cuz the seats were bad. They were your seats you didn't go there He didn't get you seats in April. These gardens are a couple years ago that had you jammed in the corner like into the bricks in a corner somewhere And we need to see they may have been admitted miles away remember, but at least they weren't obstructed you that's something I don't want a good thing I could say about oh, but you can see me you can see me. Yeah, I could see him up there You know Could see him up there in the press box putting on an axe flipping me to bird But as far as seeing what was going on in the ice especially if the other end forget it Correct It's for my mouth I want to Merced in every end of top of you and take it out my mover painted boots to Give me an impact And they'll see through the wall. Okay R. E. P. D. I. O. N. I want to train your balls. I want to love it. Well, we have you and you do a short movie And that I'll give it a bow in the morning make it That's big as it's a green sun So you take up and some on a rack on the surround you're closing to and make your wonder where We're mixed up with food that some are a Anxious on a circle side R. E. O. R. E. D. I. O. I want to train our ball That 15 at five six you've got a QM You're manned it. How do you like that? I'll write come up six to ten Moesters on a road without team with that team all boy and then ten o'clock we had a caple With the odds on whether these no lives will make it through the weekend with their NFL draft Oh, but you don't understand it's important stuff man. Yeah, right garbage here's speaking of garbage here today's great letter The editor in the hero and it won't be very significant It is a dumb letter. It's only one sentence But wait till you're who signs it when I tell you who this is only I would have noticed this In fact, you know every now and then they have those things that are put like in the one edge They're like messages like with kidnapings and ransom notes and they put a message in the you want it Well, that's maybe this was put in there for my benefit and I didn't miss it The letter says could be possibly the bomb in Kosovo to keep trying to get off their front page Question mark. That's it signed Tracy Foster in Miami Well, the most of you probably all of you that means nothing except for those of us those of me who sit in here and get these facts out of machine every morning And this scraggly crazy wild writing almost every single day of my life comes in here virtually all of it addressed to the worst team by the way, not of which they see because this isn't the effects machine for the sports nerds So all new people like he'd factoring stuff for the sports people in here and goes right in the circular file immediately not sooner Tracy Foster is the name that's usually on the bottom of those letters If you could just see the handwriting the squally hysteria the psychosis You would understand and there it is in today's Miami hero Oh, great letterly editor from Tracy Foster. Nice going. Oh, speaking to her all by the way, there is something good in there, but I should have known it was Oh, great From my good friend Howard Kleinberg Nice going Howard This is this is to me one of the great columns that was ever written in the history of this town That's as good as Howard's a friend of mine and a good guy and a long-suffering panther fan Dinner at the famous that was great food. I'm gonna read this little later. This is bringing out you probably never ate at the real famous did you know Not a little spick like you. In fact, it was your people at room that When your people started coming in that's when the famous started moving up So how what always happens the Jews get pushed out and then some minorities come in I don't want to mention any you know any specific groups but the Jews get pushed out and the next thing You know my no where you start coming in and up there goes the neighborhood Oh, sure What humans didn't bring any neighborhood down On the beach There's no way out the Mary O'Lito's didn't bring down part Oh Mary Lee those little count those are crazy prisoners. Oh, okay Here's the rail hello The rail Eight minutes and twenty six seconds and counting our first call of the day Yeah, get with it. Hey, what's going on Neil? I do answer. Hey, I pretty good I couldn't agree with you any more on your statement saying that would be impressed out of sports Absolutely I would not you know, see it's about your plastic poses these are the people who can afford to show up for the most part They're not there to see the game that they'd have put on his big act for each other And the point I was trying to make yesterday, which evidently I didn't put over very successfully was I would for the most part Rather said home in a comfort of my living room and if the game is on TV for free Why should I go there and and be surrounded by a bunch of people that don't care about the game in the first place and who are there to To to smooth and to interfere with my ability to enjoy who needs that and don't forget to look important on their cellular phone Right, if I could get a the cellular every time like I've I go to the gym right I actually see people in treadmill on the on the phone on the treadmill On the treadmill what could you possibly talking about reading? He maybe they haven't phone a bone sex. He talk about being plastic men and as far as yesterday I got And satisfaction seen the morning get clogged especially the picture what's his name Levi Levi Levi, oh, it was great. I've been done had a great song about him. I remember that can leave on when six games this year What do you think the number of those? No, you think they're gonna do it like I think they will definitely lose over a hundred games this year Oh man, oh and Alex is on the the the deal by the way to see that Alex Fernandez, which maybe he'll come back and maybe he won't all the way. It's not as bad there And they have all these athletes here. They have to send the Alabama with something on their knee Yeah, that's that probably the first and I list for named is all sent to that doctor in Alabama Cause find it a good doctor down here. I don't have to tell you boys like looking for a needle and a haste Yeah, and as far as getting that stadium and downtown no chance I didn't want to make all these jerks that were on here just a week or ten days ago And like it was a done deal. Oh, yeah, it's not a question of if it's just a question of where we're going to put it You know, not a question of whether we're going to have a stadium where we need one or the public is going to support this How in God's name could anybody with a brain now with this garbage product They're trying to pawn off on a public where there's no interest whatsoever. It's very obvious How can they expect anybody to spend any money especially in the town that's already bankrupt Exactly, no chance. One one thing before I go near sir. Are you played something for me about two years ago? I think it's called I heard it on the radio No, I saw it on the radio. Yeah, could you play that for me? I'll think about it. Appreciate it Okay, yeah 560 50560 pound five 60 on the mobile one line just like one person call here and say we need a baseball stadium and believe me I'll get really pissed off and fired up Baseball stadium. Are you people out of your mind? Is that the problem? We can have another another another place for plastic Pozers to go who don't know what the hell are watching and don't have any interest That's what's happening your sports boys and girls. They have priced it out of the realm of the ordinary fan and their families And those people are really want to go the people that used to be able to go that actually give a crap about what's going on out there And so now the people who are there like I said although they are spent yesterday three hours in five minutes couldn't get an answer why did they go? And they can't answer it. They couldn't tell you because 90% of them don't give a flying crap about what's going out there out in the field on the ice whatever the hell it is There there so we can be impressed by their presence Like an holiday time. Are you impressed with my present? Huh? No. Yeah, like I thought. Are you impressed with the free seat you got for remember there? No. Oh my god I mean if that's the best you can do you know If that's the best you can do I'll I'll talk to my good friend Joe Bolin I'll talk to Harry Neal. I'll talk to the people on the inside up there. I want to go back there Maybe I didn't enjoy the air can of the center better if I had good seats and I could sit with the real fans Not over there in my section where everybody I mean at least only scored five times in those first two periods I didn't stay for the four goals in the third but five times I'm up there screaming and shouting and they're all sitting on their hands I felt like and and I'm not gonna say I felt like I was back in mind because at least if nothing else here When a panther score we will not see in the goal light they're up there. You know Why I'm not sure about they're doing it? You're gonna excuse to make it makes it look like they really know what's going on Oh and by the way I've decided I had that tough dilemma. I am given away a bar to me. Did they my tickets for Saturday? Panthers in Tampa Bay But I decided to go to Marna because they you know Kirk McClain by the way played great last night Denise Pothan that dumb frog comes up with a new name for Kirk McClain his name now Sean McClain Hey call them Sean McClain last night great night great going there got Kirk Oh out out out out of what two nothing But that's not why I'm going oh and so if we got a Sean McClain then our the goalie must be Kirk work Is that what it is? Kirk Burke rhymes with jerk which is you Denise you idiot you dumb frog Which hopefully will get that tape today But I've decided I am going tomorrow if Beth Cohen gets to sing the national anthem because we got the Montreal Canadian so there will be two national anthem Tomorrow and I want to hear Beth Cohen sing O Canada Maybe we'll hear from Beth today. We love your bet you're the best Come at the end of the year we finally got somebody that can sing a stirring great rendition of the national anthems I just go on Beth here the best sweetheart and of course why not have a juicing and sunrise You know is not appropriate have an a Jewish lady. I mean you know the shparts of the but they black guy He's very good what was his name? Sean Eburn something like that The guy with a little earring with no hair he's excellent, but not as good as Beth I had to say that not because she's Jewish not because he's got a son tan But because she's a little bit better. He's great Which he's better here's plantation hello hey, you know how you doing okay, sir? Hey, about 15 years listener and ever called all right. I've been the looking forward to my broadcast to Panthers hockey That's all calling you about yeah, is your partner still gonna be Randy? Yeah Is that a yes yes, I'm believes. Yeah, I've been the all 40 all but two of the of the game Yeah, I've never imposed on you And not because I don't like you force on me for what just to say hello stick my you know I put in your face or yeah, well, that's good I hear you can see the goal life from up on the sky level where you'll be calling the game. That's good All right, now if you only placing you see it by the way. Yeah, and if you look at them up there Good luck to you guys. In fact, that's always been Easter pop-end of excuse blinded by the light And I go show on the clean okay, thanks. That's a good luck. Okay, see you Just got really believe I'm doing the games See I would be great because I have called hockey and I'm probably one of the best in North America next in Joe born But the chances of my working for Wayne Hizinger if there any chance to that course not I mean, I could say to Greg read here. I'll do the home games I can't go on the road and scrub my schedule of this show because that's where we'll make all the money on this show I could do that and the panthers would say I'm not gonna be a suck-ass cuz when you work are involved in anyway because you don't work for the radio station You work for the organization So you have to be an ass sucker you have to get to tongue out licky licky licky and I'm not gonna like Wayne, you know There's some things I look you know, but not Wayne So who knows what evil lurks who's gonna be the next radio voice of the panthers Chris Moris out We have something real hockey fans all ten of us in this not ought to be having big parties all over the place Oh six years not of not of mediocrity six years of totally Rotesque unacceptable work Making the most exciting sporting event in the world sound terminally dull and boring only that red that orange Hell I headed jerk parvry junior only he thought that this guy was a hockey bro a caster And only because he never heard anybody do it be besides him You know, it's like if you went into a doctor went into a doctor's office and they drew blood, you know And they let this big jogging egg wilt on your arm Like the one I have on my left arm right now and you thought hey, that was a great job You know, it didn't hurt too bad If it was the fur the only time in your life you ever had blood drawn you wouldn't you know You wouldn't know that doesn't have to look like that. It doesn't have to feel like that. You know what I'm saying if they tied the turnic it around your arm Like ten times too tight before they took the blood out and they left it there while they were talking up Pappa pappa like that And you felt like you were laying to film like all of a sudden you became an orthodox Like you were jones in for some much and it was middle of July and you couldn't figure out why Huh then you would know if that was your only experience you think this was great It's like the thing with the ice cream I was talking about if you only if you never had any other flavor besides vanilla You think hey, this is pretty good stuff You follow what I'm saying If you only had sex would like you know rose and bark you think you're not that You know 1026 if you only had sex would like for Daniels You're a rocker's cat Five hits and I'm weak it. Me and me out for the piece I see like that ball here I go again Pappa pappa cheese makes me want to snack then I lie down going to take a nap And then I'll get up and I'll make a drag a couple of toast and the buzz is coming back Now I get a thrill that I roll that way talk about my favorite good thing you'll see Mix the Mexican ketchup I sell you a letter to I hope they roll up all the phones to pass I hope I hope to take that here and say I'm back for it just where I got over the With the illegal grass grow This would stop that give me all the things I'll drop 1032 at 5.50 WQAM so anyway we just got a copy of our good close personal friend David Halberstim's book sports on radio in New York Which that little ass sucker that little put Very jackass was quoting from here a few days ago about Christine and more On page 89 and this is an interesting book by the way Of course, I'm just leaving through it and boy brings back a lot of incredible memories Even if you're not from New York But if you know all these sportscasters here's even two pages of foster you in here How do you like that eh? Well, here be a noun said that's ever been born Here's the young Marvelle Burton here before we start making all those backspiting comments And here's the great GM Woods. Here's the Poofer Jack Rick House Johnny most we lose Rob. Here's chicken man. This is great stuff I don't know. I don't know. Here's the Gary Thorne. Good guy. Gary Thorne. Does he good job a little bit the hysterical. But he doesn't good job on ESPN. He's doing these pot fan, but so anyway Here's what it says about Christine the more evidently Dale Arnold who is terminally boring Who does the Bruins games on this and he preceded Chris Moore and Jersey with the devils games And it's talking about Jean Hart the one time flyers for many many years great broadcaster It says hard had a definite opinion on Arnold's replacement in 1988 on WABC It's a TV call referring to the style of Chris Moore who got his NHL break with the devils And then unfortunately David Helbers then goes on the suck Chris is asked he says Chris Ben force He didn't do Jersey appeared in what he did a good job of ricking in a woman color commentator Sherry Ross more as easy going conversational style was quite disarming and abling Ross to feel comfortable behind the microphone Sherry a one time reporter returned to the newspaper after four years unlike Susan Waldman who's done some color Sherry was not quite as emotional or vehement in her own opinion While Moore was criticized for a non-radio non-descriptive style He knew hockey and would make bold comments that other play by play people would be afraid to make If they continue this open style they won't win this one sentence is quite redeeming in captures a thousand words Huh when Moore wasn't renewed in the Jersey 1993 He was hired by the expansion florida Panthers and has enjoyed a successful career play by playman and talk show host No, not in soft florida Mike Miller was solid technically accurate and answered more in the mold of Arnold followed Moore at the metal end with the devils But this book looks pretty interesting in fact, I think I'm going to read it today. Here's Ted using anybody member Ted using oh course not Going way way back they hit this in jackbuck sports on radio in the europe play by play history by David Halberstein Lots of good pictures in here. There's the microphone sessa and Chris Russo And all sorts of folks Aren't rust any interest no and things so here's a mobile and pombie chill out Hey Neil yes sir Oh, I got an idea for all these people that want to have a baseball stadium with a dome I can move the marlins to the Miami arena probably have a salad every guess I got a dome that's right Inside And we're just I have to cut out to make room for the baseball field. Probably have about 1500 sheets that should be enough Yeah, I would break that and back to it. Can you imagine a crowd that I use that term loosely they're going to have out there by July What a good stuff be 100 it was 94 on Sunday with their 14,000 amounts they had out there for Alex Hernandez And if it wasn't been for those 16 tubans that came out to see their hero Alex Fernandez you can imagine what kind of a crowd or what it been There's no there's no interest just like you mark my words there will be no interest I'm giving away these tickets and my personal parking pass for the Tampa light name for the lightning pantheist I'm going to be here on Saturday and let me practice it by saying this I will verbally assault anyone who is going to go to that game Ripply I mean it's a free country if you got to take it that I love the old line well how many paid for them? So what does that have to do with it? You already paid for it It would be like if you went to the store and you bought like a six pack of beer and you drank one of them and it was like a you know 20 years old Stay old sour rotten flat whatever was and you started drinking the other ones that well I might as well drink them because I already paid for So yes, I am going to like attack anybody who plans on going to that game Saturday the Panthers and Tampa Bay What it what could you possibly be thinking of? What kind of a life could you possibly have? Did you have that much spare time on a Saturday night that you would go to see such a grotesque excuse for an event? Here's a mobile and Northwater deal hello. Hello yes sir. Well I hope that I am the one that you want to rag on about the hockey because You're not only your my only call they don't want these tickets I'm this is going to be the first time in history of this show I'm given something away that's actually worth like fifty seven times 250 bucks and the parking about hundred three five bucks there will be no takers you watch. Well I want to tell you I want to be the taker and I'll explain to you why. Yeah, I have an eight year old son who plays golly on a roll of hockey team. Yeah, a roll of hockey roll of hockey just a five six seven. What what are you laughing about? Oh five sixty and pound five sixty on a mobile one line you'll see there will be no interest in these tickets. I mean what kind of a bird bring but go to that game on the lightning and the Panthers. Two teams not only not going to make the playoffs but two team two of the worst. I mean the path is just decimated with injuries and even when the injuries are forgetting about the injuries. Not too much to write home about either all year. I mean for the kind of money that they're charging and I don't care what anybody says they've shown up in big numbers like I said because they don't really care about the product out there. And Wayne's very lucky about that once again he winds up with a big horseshoe and his back dome and all that stocking worth a crap. The kind of product that they put out there these last two years the fact that anybody is willing for getting about paying for the tickets just even to show up. That's a major miracle but that's you American F and Wayne. I'll see you with the whole sports field. It's like you're supposed to feel obligated to go even if they go out there and put a garbage product out there in front of you're supposed to feel obligated. Even if they just soak the crap out of it if they squeeze the light blood out of your abank account you're supposed to feel like oh well it's my duty to go. Hi, ladies. How are you? Aaron's coming. Well, I was strong out on drugs and a few down the road because that was filled with his urine looms. Look, I'm up in the mail with a crowded at the end and I'm a friend of the door. Oh, right. And fella, we just can't turn in yellow. You're present on red through. Your business under the enclosures in a field where the woman who's never seen you. She was a totally won't you give me 12 steps, give me 12 steps. Five, six, six, six, six, six, six, seven, seven, seven. You've got to have some, enough, but not show up. Turned out, it was the floor, and you're there. Once you give it well, step, give it 12 steps. On to give it 13, maybe more. I'm getting real tired of throwing my pages. Then rolling one more for me. That's me in the meantime. At 44 or five, 50 WCM. Of course, if you stay home and watch all these sporting events, you can't have nobody a spiller beer all over you. What fun is that? Here's the fact that says, Neil, did you hear that Chris Moran is leaving the office? No. Did you hear that, George? No. Didn't hear that. Check the Harold Sports pages on the second or third page. Have we heard about that? No. That's interesting. What are we going to do now? Yeah, we were told that, you know, we ought to want to knock off, Bluff Lindsay. Pushy Golo, our program director, because he did a good service for this morning. Direct TV had turned off our thing in here, our subscription. And my thought of it at the beginning, maybe we had been lied to again, because you know, these people don't pay their bills. But anyway, they actually had paid this one. But they put it on the wrong account. So Bluff got on the phone there with the direct TV and about to be, but I'm going to really book stuff and got it all straight enough. And like, according to 10, there was our stuff. There's right there. There was the St. Jack Lals has been tremendous at this. Yeah, right. Get on it. So, it didn't even want to rip him. But he comes in here yesterday and like during a commercial break, any talks have to me like whispers like, like somebody had just died. Seriously. We want, this is not for air. And I want you to keep this real quiet because we don't want to put this, like, like, seriously, I like somebody had died. And he announces to me that Christina Moore, I won't become a back next year to the pad, which I already knew that anyway. But we didn't want to put it on the year because we wanted the Panthers to announce it first. We didn't want to pre-ent their opportunity to announce that this bozo, this total absolute waste of space, is not coming back to monotone his way through the games next year and put everybody into a coma. Not just a bad performance the last three years, the last six years, ate a graceful performance, taking something that exciting and making it terminally boring by refusing to like inject any enthusiasm excitement or even describe what's going on. I wonder how they feel about that in Toronto, eh? Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? You're in Toronto. Sure, yeah. Nice to know why Toronto is on Sunday, by the way, but then you couldn't get out of there. Hey, well, this way, we don't want to take you to the super-dairy left. Oh, yeah. If the eating center, right. If we've all got a little bit of one. I'll go there. Look over there by the by R-B's there in the food court. There was another one on the floor too, I think. Oh, that was far to hear that. It happens to the best of us, but. Oh, hey, it's happened to me. I cooked those in North Carolina. Oh, and that's a good place to leave it. Oh, listen, I just, why have you been in the air Canada center? Yes, I was in there for a basketball game because we can't get near a hockey game. They're sold out from about 400 years. But, uh, not see how to roll a bus for the Raptors, but for the Maple Leafs, I was so depressed and disappointed. Now it's a beautiful building and except for the fact that the hallways are too narrow, they have great food out there. It's a Minnesota food. The hallways are too narrow, so it's jammed up real bad. Uh, but inside it's beautiful. However, the atmosphere in there was a sterile as the inside of a bandaid box. Oh, absolutely. And you know, the first thing I asked the guard, those stupid idiots that the waiters would have taken the orders. Exactly. You never would see that in Maple Leaf Gardens. And Maple Leaf Gardens, the people were there to see the game. They weren't there to, uh, it's likely transplanted a whole bunch of plastic people from down here. And we moved them up there. And then every time the Leaf scored the first two purits, they're, you know, I'm on my feed. I'm screaming. I'm cheering. All the people around me, they're in the Red Seats. They're sitting on their ass. And I'm not exaggerating. There wasn't one other person. I mean, down in a plant, I'm sitting in the gold. I guess that's where the real fans will have spent that much money. They were cheering. They were on their feet. But in my section, I might felt like out of place. Like, what am I screaming about? The thing is, you don't get real friends in that game because they're, they're cameras and are still new. Yeah. So you're getting all the plastic people coming up. It's a place to be seen. You can't get a real hockey fan. We'll never get to a hockey game there. Not for like, it's enough for like, the next 400 years. Isn't this pathetic? This is what's happening to sports everywhere. They build these new venues. They overpriced the tickets and all these plastic posers line up, pick it up all the seats. And like you said, they don't care what's going on. They actually are busy ordering food from the little, uh, the order taker there with her little, things she's doing there with a computer. They're passing visas and master cards back and forth and cash up and down her role. What kind of crap is that? Uh, it's ridiculous. And you know, now the Leafs are thinking about they're deciding whether to sell, playoff tickets to the general public. And they probably won't. Of course not. Why should they do that when they got all these suckers locked in? Yeah. No kidding. So listen, so I'm calling about those Panther tickets. Can someone fly me down? Ha ha ha ha ha. Believe me, you don't want to see this. Even even the Leafs in their worst years never played a game. Like, that's going to be Saturday. The Panthers and the Lightning. I know. I mean, why not? They just cancel with that. Exactly. Well said. All right. Say how to foster. We'll do. Okay. Call from Toronto, eh? Oh, there's a guy knows what I'm talking about. Why can't they show it beyond all over the world instead of just down here with these nose pickers? Yeah, you're going back on you. Where are nobody else? Some of those people in the last 15 minutes yesterday. Some of you morons out there. I have said right from the beginning of the year. At least I'm consistent about that. You got all these billions of people showing up and why are they there? Did I say that right the beginning? All these people that don't seem to be interested in the event. Whatever it is that they're supposedly somebody is paying for those tickets. I'm not impressed by an asshole on a cell phone and having traveled over much of the world. I hate to break the news to you. But they're on cell phones everywhere in Italy. That's the big thing. I'm a streets of Rome. All those wops over there. They're on their cell phone. Okay? Because it's new and exciting. And I guess they feel it's, you know, it's the American. It's the American, if and way. So they want to feel like, you know, and it Amsterdam. They're on their cell phones. But here it's old. It's older than Methuselah. Okay? Everybody even sluppers have cell phones. Right? With the prices nowadays? Everybody can afford a cell phone. So are we impressed by the fact that you have a cell phone stuck to your ear? No. No. Just like I'm coming home from the airport the other night. Oh, brother. I really should write not a book. I should write a series of books. I could write a book on my visit to the doctor's office yesterday. I could write like an encyclopedia on that. You know what I'm talking about? I think you might know what I'm talking about. Oh, come down. And I could certainly write a book on the driving here. And forget about the driving day and day out. I'm just talking about in terms of coming back from trips out of town, which I do a lot. Try to get out of the airport, which I talked about last week about how the idiots don't have any money. And you said they're just trying to pay your way out of there. I'd like to get home sometime before 4 in the morning. You know. And then give them that again out there on 836. And here you know, it was on the pulmetto. And let me say again, the biggest asshole in the world clogged up the pulmetto. Those other people out there assholes clogging up that road. And there's a broad and leptan lane. And at this point, it's getting close to 103. There were it's a, it's like an eight lane highway at that point. So this four lanes go north and south on the pulmetto. And this young bitch, she's on the phone there. She's going nowhere in the left hand lane, okay? So I finally enabled it and she's just backing up traffic. She's going like 45 miles an hour and a speed of a 65 or whatever it is. She's going way under back in everybody up. So I find to get around to the right and I pass you around to the right and I always do this. When I pass an asshole, I look to see what is it that's behind the wheel. Like yesterday I had that happen to me. There was a dead man in his dead wife in the car. Seriously, dead man driving. It was on sunrise bullet at arm going home yesterday. And there was a man who has been 400 years old driving at his wife was 380. They were both dead and they were driving in car. Barely, barely moving. In the left hand lane of course. So I get next to that. Look, and here's this young bitch. I don't want to say anything about her ethnicity, okay? She was white. She was, but anyway, it was in higher league. But anyway, she's on the cell phone, okay? And she's like, well, I happen to, and I'm going to tell you. And I'm all alone in the car. And I started unleashing a series of obscenities, loud, screaming and yelling and carrying on the likes of what you may have never heard in your life. I was so pissed off. You miserable disgusting bitch, okay? You like that? She was so happy. He would have a good count. We said, look at me. I'm driving. I'm driving. I'm in the car. I got it. Yeah, she's got a key. She's got the ignition key. She's a dangerous bitch. She's in the car. She's moving it. Not much. And she's on the cell phone. Have an wonderful time. She has had to be a smile on her post. Maybe she had her finger. Yeah, I only saw one hand. She was going so slow. She'd never had her hand on the wheel. Maybe that's why she had such a big smile on her post. Bitch. The disgusting obnoxious young bitch. Get off the road. Part of it. Get out of our face. We're not impressed with your stupid cell phone. You nauseating obnoxious bitch. And have a nice day. Here's a number of clients. Hello. Any other choice? What is it? I said you should write choices books. Very descriptive. Yeah. You should write them through hell. What those old blue hairs. Obviously use the white muckels on the steering wheel. That's the scary side. Yeah. That'll get some nervous driving through there. So it's going to be asleep for this weekend. Okay. 560560. See, there's the difference. We had the call from Toronto. We had like a real living and breathing person on there. And then we had a call from Pembroke Pines. Okay. Anybody thinks that I exaggerate or I make up the things that I say about this area. And the people here and the callers we get. And just in general, the callers are reflection of this town. Right there. Just compare the two calls. Okay. Like a real honest to God person and that. Whatever that was that. That thing. In fact, every day I come in here. You know who I speak to every day on this show? All of these things. Right. By the way, so this guy finally facts me the article from the New York Times. You never read about it here because we get no information about anything here. And he was right. Sir, I apologize. See, I doubted your veracity, but you were right. Harness racing. Three drivers suspended. Not that anybody here cares about this. George Brennan. Howard Pauke and Jim Morrell Jr. We're suspended by the New Jersey Racing Commission. It has been suspended six months each and five hundred dollars each. As a result of what officials called on satisfactory performances last month. And it goes on to describe the race and about how we'll see. Parker had to have a favorite, etc. and so on. And in other words, the perfective paints is spatiously low. And the trifecta paid unbelievably suspiciously low. An investigation revealed that the better was Parker's show for the cash heavily on the exact and the trifecta who transported him from pre-old of the metal lands daily. The better earned 24 grand for his wages. But has been unable to collect six grand because the judges order the permutual who owned those clothes when they came to suspicious of the payouts. The better who would not identify as Howard and attorney do have the winnings released. Ha ha, alright. And Brennan insisted yesterday and that telephone interview all he did was follow the racing instructions of the owner Yati Adiati. Right, that avoid Georgie and I was going. And they wonder why people are staying away from the tracks in droves. They can't figure it out. All the old track goers they've died off. And they wonder why they can't attract that new young crowd. Oh, it's big and gambling by the way. Got a whole bunch of stuff about that. Of course, leave it to the Harold and good old Governor Jim. I thought we were going to get those slotted pompadal parking all of her mutuals. I've been here in my good buddy Ted Snell, blow them smoke about that. And evidently he has been blowing smoke because his eyes suspected Governor the bushmider the bushman. He has vehemently opposed to any increasing of gambling. And of course he's that goody two shoes. And here's another note to Christina's the message remains clear. Leave that a turtle in the Harold today. At least they just keep banging away and banging away and banging away. Oh, state is right to fight federal order allowing Indian casino. That's right. When and out, stop them out. That's what the Harold says because gambling is evil. But if you turn to the sports page, check out those ants for those gambling cruises, etc. and so on. And then turn over to the inside page. There we have the latest line on a girls volleyball game from Elmairah High against the Virginia Tech. The Harold is just what it is. That's what Tracy Foster said. Come to you, ladies and gentlemen, my family, we are dead. I'm the real old man. I'm the real old man. I'm the real blackboard John Feele, black black black black black. Even though one hand is catching it's the welfare. Oh, fucker. I'm on the horse and we're swimming. It's sound of the Southern sport. He's so street-y.

Hello Mobile and Davey, yes, sir This is Joe Talk to you today. Yes, I'm caller. All right. I want to the first game of the season this year Gonna rip me for setting this but I mean, yes Was it hand I game right. I wasn't yeah So here I am wanting to go to the last cancer game and I figured it's gonna be my best chance to actually see them For the price I can get them with all these I don't know if there's many scalpers out there But I got to imagine they're gonna be going cheap tonight tonight. Oh You know all the lip the game might yes I'm not tonight. I mean that Saturday night. Oh, yeah, and I I would like to have seen a better game. I should say But being a fan of the fan that I am Sorry we are those panzers. They really blow. Yeah Yeah, they're tragic. I think you're By the way, let's Sean the claim nice game last night. Sean even though that was his first name anymore But nice gone great game last night in goal. That's your release name one that game and out of it wasn't that interested anyway I guess all that's very I hate to break the news to my good friend Jeff Romer these pot fans But why don't you worry about Kirk McClain getting hurt in the crease there? They'd call the penalty shot Okay, the reason the guys after it's centralized and all the rest of the teams are over by the bench They'd call the penalty shot boys maybe I never saw anything like that in my life. Okay, remember we'll never live that down as long as he lives They got a penalty shot the most exciting playing hockey which is called maybe only 15 20 times a year in a whole league Here's a penalty shot coming against the panzers which McClain stopped by would you see that last night? If I did yes, I did see it Welcome to Denise Pothman where like so distracted that I mean by that time a claim was already Often he was laughing he was fine. I mean take a look around and see what else is going out there boys Okay, hold on, paddy got it all right and enjoy the game if that's possible Thank you. I appreciate it Hang on all right Okay, good guy to run the day. He's a good guy given the tickets and a parking pass That'll get that out of my here. Okay, and I'm not gonna rip me want to go for free These are great seats at least you got good seats pal and don't blame me if those people happen to show up Saturday night And hold their babies up in front of your head. You can in fact you won't be sitting in those seats again probably so bitch him out So hey put the kids down and cut the crap here already you maniacs See one thing I don't understand about that family. There's there's one guy that shows up who's always coming right from business He's always got a white shirt on you know and he brings his little girl and he's I think he's the brother of the other guy that's his in front of us And he's great. He's a good guy. He's his girl is like Polite that she sits in the seat and there's none of this crackle when I was him He's part of that same family I believe But the other guy and the wife and the father and the mother and the 25 kids up and down and up and down and back and forth and waiting And every possible way under the sun to make sure you don't enjoy even even if you could enjoy Which most of our games you wouldn't anyway? Even if there's a child image chance that you might enjoy it no chance And that's that's a message. I try to convey yesterday and again today and just like the guy from time glad he called from Toronto to verify what I told you I have the reason to make that up That experience of the air Canada Center on Saturday was devastating to me unbealingly disappointing Forget about the crappy seats that remember got us and now far away. They were even setting that aside the same boring Tired old war now crap on a scoreboard there with a gene all those clips from the same movies I thought that was something originally we're doing down here But again, it's pre-fabricated. That's what you have in America now all over North America Pre-fabricated sporting events with pre-fabricated fans pre-fabricated excitement pre-fabricated applause Dad, then I'm not for that. I don't go for that I'm old enough to remember when you go to a game and there was no although all those other trappings And you got excited because you were into whatever was going on and hopefully it was a quality event and yeah, there was something exciting going on maybe not now Very sad. I knew Fuck you There was no farmer who lives on your eyes He said in the middle just shaking his head that some boys who were down by the brick They're beating the water there in on their marbles and glazing then at half past four their team A young lady she looked like a pretty young creature She sat on the grass. She pulled up her dress and she showed them her rumples and leaves and white club beat up She said she was learning a new way to bring up her children So they would not spin while the boys in the far yard were show well They wrapped you standing there from yesterday's hunt while the girl in the middle was rubbing her eye That the fellow down by the dot even a black-up man with a side of all home in the country with a big fence out front If he has to phone like least you show him burn this dope at dog who was subject to fit and Maybe she left him grab hold of her small tender and with the movement so quick and then she'd been over and suck God is candy so tasty made of butter sky and then he spread with cream all over her cookies That she had left out on her show if you think this is 30 you can go 14 a.m. 50 W.M. I'm telling I'm getting such I'm getting goosebumps looking in this so they've helped her stand Problem is down here most of the people down here grew up either here and Never heard any of the great broadcasters because they couldn't hear those stations follow over the country like we could up north Or they grew up in some foreign country. I want to mention no names. You know, so what they know about sportscasters Here's oh, and now we get to the part here's all the x-jax. There's go dodgola. Oh my god And Phil Rosudo and Bill White And the most the most illuribate one of them all fran healy. I mean it's not even a contest. Okay The thick tongue dored fran healy. See when a jax took over sportscast and then when it turned to a trap So yesterday speaking of that I was a George told me as usual bad information I was asking where can you get those icons died bars the very low carburetor not that they're very good there But it's something you know Something better than eating crap eating was a candy or somewhat a lot of carbohydrates and all his wife goes and gets Bags full of the public. She says so I go to my public. See after the afternoon I scoured I looked high I looked low. I looked in the diet foods. I looked in the health foods I looked in the candy section. I looked under every goddamn section that I find them And I went to Walgreens. I looked around in there. I looked up oh and by the way, you know those I got to tell you something seriously They're got to be how come we're sitting here? Why are we making millions every day? There's so many stupid people out there I'm at Walgreens and I'm looking back where they have the slim fast and all that direct and They've got all these bar but diet bars and I look at the carbohydrates on these 50 grams 35 grams Low in fat but Loaded with carbohydrates is anybody got to probably lose weight with that crap. No, no Even if that's all I eat is those bars, you know, I have it doesn't have a day. They're gonna lose weight No, I mean I happen to have it doesn't times five at times 50 S 300 grams a day of carbs couldn't find the goddamn acnes or whatever what do they call those advantage bars and The only advantages that they're low in carbs not that they taste very good and you think that you know our good buddy Bob Lincoln Would you think that he'd have brought us a whole back full of those My good close personal friend Bob Lincoln that did those two great trips to a Practice and practically put us all into our graves Zeba lost big in He's the best he really piece of he's a good guy He's okay, where were y'all?

Fillur don't know to hold them together That's the only reason they put bread crumbs in meatballs And so that they don't all come apart while they're cooking them like in whatever they cook them in and they have no taste bread crumbs none Don't you think we can find some of that makes meatballs without bread crumbs with that guys.

I'm I said for the 10 minute time You know whatever you want to do. Okay. It's a free world I just give my advice based on my own personal experience and believe me Especially after being to my hyperventilated doctor yesterday. I know my crap. Okay Even at the Eden Center to Ronald. They know my crap. They're cool smelly from Sunday What I mean all of this low fat and sugar free Hey, you look at the carbohydrates if you're one of those people that has a problem fat because you can't handle carbohydrates And by the way, somebody facts his mean this information glucose and fruit dose increased fat in the bloodstream See some people think that if they don't eat refined sugar that if they've fruit toast You see that that's part of the propaganda from the health food nuts over the years As a matter of fact some people say fruit doses better for you because it doesn't cause the same rise in insulin levels after me Let's say which is important to thy bet is however It seems to be particularly good at raising triglycerides after meal high in fat So if you want to just keep polluting up like defoe as in the morning and like the booster just keep eating your substitutes fruit dose and glucose at a set of them so on It says they did they this is really interesting They tested the fat levels in the blood of 22 subjects who on four different occasions consume milkshakes Made alternatively with no sugar fruit dose glucose and as per tame Nutri suite fat levels were checked after fasting and before the study participants drank the milkshakes then every two to eight hours Then every two hours for four hour effort eight hours the investigators found the amount of fat absorbed from sugar sweetened shakes with 38 to 60% more Than from the unsweetened or artificially sweetened shakes and that the fat stayed in the bloodstream longer after the milkshakes were consumed So the no sugar of any kind was fine and also the Nutri suite the expert thing was fine But they flipped toast and the glucose and all these other things Cup of crap Did you oh you didn't see I'm asking did you see these facts you don't see anymore good? No, that's because this right behind me now I get all the facts is direct well, there's one it's kind of interesting Here's a stack they see on the atkins diet a can of canfields diet chocolate soda in a big glass add some ice a couple of tablespoons of Liquid whip of liquid whipping cream liquid whipping cream What does that mean and top of either cool whip or whipped cream total one carb one car People by that chocolate soda for long time.

Denny what the fame is that was great food which I can only say huh After the gefilter fish in the chop after the chop liver and after the chicken soup with three months of balls and egg noodles I pulled back from the pass-over saider table and thought just as I do every year. I'm stuffed. I'd like to opt for the skeleton dinner The skeleton dinner appetizer soup dessert, but no main course was in my memory point at what it was once One of my mebeaches most famous restaurants and appropriately called the famous On 1977 my mehode restaurant reviewer referred to the famous Deskeleton dinner as an escape hatch with everything else being shoved onto the table who needed the main course The restaurant at 671 Washington Avenue was founded in 1945 by Morris Lerner the site has a history in 1934 was the tiptoe bar in grill in 1937 it was leaving his restaurant and beginning in 1938 it was a restaurant operated by Oscar and Esther Bernstein the famous under several owners had a lifespan of 36 years a died in 1981 a victim of the evolving Demographics of South Beach Plus a change in people's eating habits heavy food was on the way out salads and fluff were in control Those of us still around who patronized the famous will recall how immediately upon being seated The coal-slaw pickle sourcrout and several kinds of bread were put on the table followed by a bottle of Seltzer and upon request a chocolate syrup for a make-your-own drink of New York origin While nibbling and drinking you then faced the crisis you order a full meal or just the skeleton dinner Knowing the appetizers on the skeleton dinner include that I am such a stuffed Derma Knieches and all those other exotic but filling Eastern European Jewish foods and also knowing that the super What was to follow chicken soup with mottable's or noodles according to the menu They're usually got chicken soup with mottable and noodles. You thought twice about a main course How much can you eat after the soup wants to look at a boiled beef like and or stuff cabbage? Oh god, did they have good stuff cabbage brisket or beef or pastrami style smoked duck so you opted for the skeleton dinner Sometimes if you already had ordered the main course, but were real nice a waiter or waitress would let you off the hook when you play it Please, did you could eat no more the order was rewritten as a skeleton dinner and as a reward you provided a little extra in the tip Learn a solar restaurant in 1964 to Harry's Zuckerman who later sold it to his son iri and son and la lary winkler Winkler eventually bought it iri's ockerman share But things were changing for the famous when I hosted my parents 50th wedding anniversary dinner with the famous in 1980 The number of patrons was already declining neither the marial influx nor the art deco south beach movement Let itself to chop liver mottable's and pickle tomatoes and April 1981 winkler close the restaurant Planning that he would reopen in November before that however he released a business to one favoli and Eric Velasco Cuban Americans who openly course their an ocean who owned a course their an ocean haven hotels The new owners reopened in December kept some of the old ethnic menu, but served lobster bisc instead of chicken soup periay instead of shelter They couldn't make a go of it and shut down I remember that I went there when they reopened I went oh oh my god Yeah In August 1984 the famous reopened as a gay nightclub and restaurant and again the menu was modified this time to include Spanish and Italian foods and addition to American style food this too had a short life While the strange of yetish may be gone the building host of vibrant establishment today in 1985 It opened as the strain still one of south beaches popular late night spots nevertheless The ghost of Hungarian Gulosh.

I mean everybody ever Strophens is that Naples is nothing but a bunch of sluppers And from men is poverty there there's tremendous crime as many gypsies there and Rome is 50,000 more in the Naples I think that you're cheating them all the way you got including them for them I live in Rotten down for three and a half years.

I mean there's you know beggars out on the street, but that's but there's a safe city and there's not it's not rampant poverty all over the place Everybody tells me Naples is basically a tremendously poor and it not only that, but in fact They have the big movement in Italy as you know where they wanted the Central and Northern parts of the country Want to separate from Southern Italy because it's so it's so poverty-stricken I will say it's different. I wouldn't say he says that's poverty-stricken Well, then why do they want to separate? In other words the whole world is just making these things up No, I'm not gonna say it. No, I don't know.

So what happened? I've been here a long time ago. I hope so. Did somebody call in the tell you that we were speaking about you? Yeah, I got a phone call a few minutes ago and said, Neil said, you see, a live? Where is he? Because I know you wouldn't have been listening. That much I know. Right. It's not to come. I have any objection to your program. It's simply that I'm so busy making money in this market that I don't really know what to do. I think I'm going to lose it in a month or two. Well, that's everything. Well, that really collapses for right now. It looks so good. Well, the next day's done 15. So I'm not too excited right now. But I got by my CNBC on here watching. So what are you doing besides entertaining people? That's basically it. I travel all around the world. I haven't been to China or Kosovo yet. But there it is. Next time I listen. Stay away from Kosovo. Yeah. For this way. Before you go to China, call me out there eight times. Yeah. What about Amsterdam? Have you been there? I've been to Amsterdam. But I was always my wife. So I never went to the red light district. Except for service or car. Yeah. What about Rome? I would think that a good traveler like you would have had a whole time. All of his marvelous marvelous marvelous. Not that I had dinner with some people the other night that lived there. And they have a. There are wealthy people that they have a. A squiz it new condominium and keep this cane. Yeah. A villa up in Tuscan. And. And. And. Yeah. Well, there's that old saying when in Rome, do the Romans. I've been doing that for years. Well, listen, Irvits. Great hearing from you. It's good to hear from you. And if you want to call me some time. I'm. Next one. I'll be glad to talk to you for a week. Okay. I can. Good luck with your program. Thanks. Bye. Bye. Oh, my God. Can you believe that? Can you believe it? Oh, my God. So like I said, thanks to that guy to call before it brought up all those old names. Now who would be other names? He brought up. Oh, Bill Smith. Because I like where he's a good guy. Old, but I need a real good guy and he can hear that travel thing going all the time trying to get people to go to China, but he's a good guy. But Bill Smith. I don't know. And said, live in. Well, you know, maybe he'll come to my funeral, too. You know, because I don't hear from him. No more. Because I'm, you know, I'm not. I got to be disgusting on the air. I do this thing. I do now. And I make it a lot of money. And I'm not doing that all boring establishment. I've never less had given me my first break in a market. So I should be grateful for that, which I am, but other than that have a nice life said, Mr. establishment. Is a good guy. So let me tell you a speaker said about the Lin Russell. Oh, sorry. 5.670560, Tom 560 on the AT. Okay, let's get a wee talk to her. Should learn. Oh, boy. That's our poll question, which put you in a coma more. My talk at her. She and her is a nice guy, but fairly old. Or rather, you're story about the famous from Howard Kleinberg. I liked reading that thing about the famous. Okay. The audience obviously did not. They were disgusted and revolted by that because they wouldn't know the famous restaurant from your reign. It's okay. Right. Speaking of what I just said. These advantage bars. You know, I dare one person in this audience. Okay. I dare you. Let's do a thing like little kids do. You know, I doubled their you. They're called this show and say that the Atkins advantage bars that you would like them. Okay. I dare you to say because we will trace the call. And after the after the guy with the rubber, the from the rubber room with the butterfly net after he gets a hold of my doctor first, then we'll have him come and get you. You'll be next on the list. Seriously, I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm going to puke is what I'm going to do. God, like them compared to what compared to that and you know something I don't want to gross you out. It's after lunch time. I would have rather picked up those underwear there left at the eaten set of restroom on Sunday in Toronto. And had lunch off of those after I had my little miss hat. But rather had that then this. I mean, is there anybody who has the audacity to tell me now they do fill you up their filling. I'm not there filling or they just make you nauseous. I love doctor Rackens. I'm a big proponent of his diet. I mean, it works if you can stick with it and that's set of them so on. But but. I will not for any for lover money. I'm not going to come on here and tell you something's good if it's a piece of crap and believe me. This isn't even good enough to be identified as a piece of crap. My golden retriever leaves big bombs in a backyard every day that I'm sure are much more advertising than this. I'm not going to check it out myself, but you know, I mean, I'm halfway through the brownie hound the bar. Apply named by the way, because it looks like and taste like. Brownies. They feel you up because you have to use a gallon of water just to water to wash it down. Yeah. I mean, there is a there is a I can't describe it. There is kind of like a rancid rancy rotten taste that goes along with these. That is not to be believed and it's not animal or vegetable. What is it? You saw the direct. I mean, seriously, I love you, Dr. Bob and my good friend Bob look it over there Mr. we once went to Vegas and had a nightmare doing it. You know, but these advantage bars and then I had same thing happened last year. Why would I like them now? Are they any different than they were then? No. They are in edible. Now I'm going to get through the second one and I'm going to get this. This will time. It makes you sick of your stomach. Okay. Maybe that's the maybe that's part of the reason that these things work on the diet. You become so nauseous. You feel so you're your kishgis are just twisting from nausea. Have you belched yet? I couldn't because it would all get to go back at you. If you think the after taste is good. Oh, wait. So the repeater happens. And then wait. Oh boy. Wait till last. 9 minutes after one and 5 60 WQAM. Get the honey tune. I like lupion cobalt. Why do you have little pie with chocolate chip ice cream? I'll take with chocolate chip ice cream is good. Ring ding. Ah. And chocolate chip ice cream. Wait. Chocolate swirl ice cream even better. That's nice. Did you ever suck the jelly out of the jelly down that? Yes. And with the chocolate swirl ice cream. I like to stuff a jelly down it for the Reese's Pinopata cut. Then put it in the warm oven and let the chocolate and everything melt into the dough. I'll put it in jelly. Or a chocolate-covered grey emcracker. Within my use of banana on top. Could have a little lemon in my water please. I make chocolate chip cookies with eminere. And it's chocolate chip. No, not me. Yeah. So you can have a little more lemon in my hot water please. Just a lap of a lot of lemon. No, I like a little fresh orange juice. Squeeze the more in the pie. No. Sorry. Okay, that lemon. I promise they got chocolate covered orange which is the juice just dribbles down your chin. Oh. Mmm. Mmm. Junior. Could I have just a drop of honey in this please? Just a drop. Why do the actual food? It's covered with that sweet dark chocolate. You know. Oh boy. I had a right to stuff on the banana down that. Mmm. Mmm. Get the honey to me. Give me the honey, Junior. It's in the cupboard down. Well, get it. What else did they cover with that chocolate? I mean, this has the orange, which is grapes, peaches, strawberries. Junior. Honey. Those big two-she steps strawberries are dipped into that dark dark chocolate. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Mmm. Mmm. Yeah. Oh. Get the honey. Get the honey. Oh, no. I'm not going to say 50. This is the worst soil. And just to show you about a tube rind. Because I don't want to prejudge one of each. There's three different flavors. Chocolate, macadamia. I had that unbelievable. What was the other one? The brown and brownie, huh? Had that. Inedible. Now we got, I mean, it's only two four six grams per bar of carbs. So three of them is like seven point eight grams. And after this third one, and I do mean you third one. I won't be eating for a week. That's how this works. Now what's what kind of this peanut butter, uh, Drecked chunky peanut butter as then you'll be hurling chunks when you finish eating this if you can. I have never had anything so rancid so gross in my mouth. And believe me, I've had plenty of things in my mouth in my life. But never anything. Oh. God. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Wanted to let you know, uh, brought the, a possible substitute for that stuff of yours. Oh, because I had them to take a doing that. And, uh, this is the most foul tasting record. The compliment. Exactly. Direct the word, Dreck is insulted by using that apply to this. Yeah, and you might like this because Walbreen just started carrying them. The, uh, pure protein bars. Do the one that have all the carbohydrates in them that I checked out last night of Walbreen? Yeah, but that was, oh, you did check it out last night. I loaded with carbohydrates, right? Yeah, I think it was 11 grams for a one of them. But if you want something to help you get that, the sugar fix that chocolate moose and the chewy chocolate chip will definitely highlight your day. Chocolate moose one. Uh, it's like white chocolate moose. You mean the protein bar? Yeah, the pure protein. They came out with these flavors, uh, like two of them, two new flavors and they are incredible. I guess 11 grams isn't bad. If you're not going to eat much of any other carbs of us today, maybe you're selling. Oh, yeah, but it's like it's like a dessert. But at least it's good, though, huh? Oh, yeah, that's because I do the acting's relatively strict. And I cheat one day a week to keep myself saying you've seen others. You have tried these advantage bars. Uh, made them stay one time. Oh, I'm browning. Oh, I like I just put my mouth in Chrisco. Oh, my God. And I just took a handful of lard and swallow it with the same exact feeling. Oh, well, thank you, sir. God bless you. All right. Good luck, my friend. And keep it up. All right. So there's this suggestion for you. Just check the carbs at the back of protein bar in Walgreens. Okay, I'll check that one out. Because the idea and I'm going to finish all three of them here. Just to show you. Okay, what? It is going to make me tremendously ill. You're a braveer man tonight. No, just dumb or not brave or dumb or. The good news is, though, because there's a silver lining in the middle of even the darkest cloud. They were for free, baby. It was a soft thought away. They were for free. Okay. Oh, man. Let me say again, I challenge one person out there in the audience to call the show across your wife likes him. But we know you've got to have to take him. You married you. Yeah. You say no. It's the same dilemma. Meaning what? We're on the atkins and she wants something to not shonder in the day. I mean, when you get to use the things him home by the bag full of she's eating these left and right you said. Yeah. And Louisville food. Oh, come on. There's a lot of you actually don't like the cut to be more to life than the onions that bad is bar boys and girls. There must be more to life than this. You see, again, if you believe in this God bull crap, how come everything that tastes good is loaded with carbohydrates and makes you fat and sick and die, huh? All right. Which one is the least bad? There's no such thing. There is no such thing. Oh, in fact, you know something I'm starting to develop a little cramp without the M. I'm having another Toronto like experience. I think any minute now. But don't have too far to go down the hall to make it. Oh, this is, oh, I'm not eating this. Are you crazy? Straight in the way. Straight in the way. Spask it. Like I have to prove a point here by eating three pieces of three of the sticks of direct. Here's a mobile and bonnet of spring. Hello. Hey, me, how are you? Okay, sure. I'm getting sick as a dog. I hear that. Hey, I'm just down here work. I'm from the Tampa area. And we miss you very much in that area. Yeah, well, I wish we could say it was mutual. Uh, she's a very personal. Yeah. We got a guy on the radio up there and sports show during the day. That ripped off a lot of stuff. Yeah, well, go say hi to him. Okay, thanks. Okay, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless life. See, we're not going to have any takers on this advantage bar thing. This audience is hopefully got better taste than that. Even if people would bet, even if people like vanilla ice cream wouldn't eat those things on a bit. Here's Naples. Hello. You're Neil. Yes, sir. You got to go out and try the coconut chocolate one. Yeah, right. I know. I bought all four flavors. Yeah. And the other three are exactly as you said. Yeah. It tasted like ass-certainment. No, they don't. I actually mean. That's well, yeah. Now you're going to be close. Yeah. I'm serious. I think we're taking it virtually and that's very well-plored. Yeah. Try it. Have you guys tried the coconut one? I don't have no coconut one. Maybe that's the only good one. That's why they pawned the rest of this crap off on us because they did it only good one must be out. Yeah, that's crap. It's garbage. I'm telling you, sir. crap is not in the same category as this. And what a crap is is fine with the ingredients. Have you tried the like in the book where it says, eat some diet jealous and whipped cream? I went to the diet jealous with whipped cream until I got jealous coming out of my ear. I'm not a huge amount of that. I'm a poor person. If I ever see any more diet jealous, she's going to get a bar. Alright. Well, good luck. Thanks, pal. See you in Apale. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T. Wireless one. Killer car, but high rates, the only problem is God made everything else so it tastes pretty bad. How come we can't get like a hot-fudge Sunday on fish food with thick gums of hot-fudge and whipped cream and marshmallow on top and have no carbs, huh? How God, you bastard God, you know good, miserable, sadistic, son of a bitch. How can we did this to us, huh? And then I made this every now and then have a, in our pants at top of it all off. Just just kind of like the frosting on the cake, so to speak. Kind of look like the frosting on the cake. Here's a mobile in Boker, hello. Hey, Neil, how are you doing? Okay, sir. I'm on a great dessert for you in Boker, tell him there's a fat free cheesecake. I'm not a more cheese cake, sir. No more cheese cake. And he said, fat free. Sir, let me see it again. Fat free is for assholes. Okay, sir. Don't take it personally unless it does happen to apply. Fat free is for idiots. Fat free is a fraud. Okay, fat free is crap. They had a piece on CNN here a couple of days ago about fat kids in America. It's not only the adults like us who are getting fat, but now it was a frightening, a terrifying number of fat kids. Not just teenagers, but like young kids who are big and fat. And you know, I want to say this to you right now, okay. All you parents out there that let you, it's bad enough that you're fat. But you parents that walk around with your fat kids, shame on you. Child abuse. I don't want to mention no names of somebody that was in here a few days ago with this fat son. We seem like a real nice kid if he didn't wait 10,000 pounds. Fat parents have fat kids. Am I right? Or what? I guess they want their kids to be a sick as they are. Man, man, having your kid walk around waddling around and everybody else in school is making fun. Hey, Johnny's a fat little pig. Hey, fuck it, hey, fuck it. Terrible. Shame on you. You feed Johnny one or two of these atkins vars. He would need for a month. Just take one of those in his lunchbox, man. We got no spend most of the afternoon school on his hands and he's puking his brains out. Here's a mobile and top and a hello. Hello, Victor. I like the atkins for you, huh? I'm sorry. No, you're not. I'm not. I just got the reference for the. Of the. Oh, my God. Well, if I can only paraphrase what this guy just said, okay? Because I can't put it on the ear. What's wrong with this thing now? But oh, here we go. What is wrong with this thing? You know, it's not even worth it now. You know what I'm saying? The fact that he said. Let me get shit. What he said. God, I'm getting really definitely. I only need a little just about a turret of that last bar that all that when you'd tell me was so great to peanut put a one. I didn't say it. I don't even like peanut butter. I like peanut butter by itself. You know what I mean? Like I could eat peanut butter. Huh? I do. I like chunky peanut butter. Well, I have an eating at years and it's not good for it. But I could eat out of the jar like with a spoon. Used to do that. But like peanut butter ice creams and peanut butter star. Horrible. It's like mushrooms. I love mushrooms. But I don't like mushrooms on pizza. Can't stand the shrooms on pizza. In fact, those magic mushrooms like they have an Amsterdam. Those are pretty good. Oh, man. Where am I? Who I feel like Admiral Stockdale? I'm a, I'm a mobile in Miami, hello? I knew I was a shroom piece pretty good too. I'm suffering the same thing with you to be acting. You know, it's good to hear some kind of something I made. Let's go through the day. Oh, I wanted to call on saying to you for the tickets for Sunday for the moment game. Yeah, I was buying some Chris in the, uh, that certain part of town. And I actually had a good time with all my, but we're dropping them my daughter. And you know, we're going to get time. I understand that there's no, there's not, there's not drawn flies when I have the stadium talk. It's out of control. So, but I just want to call on thank you that really good time. Okay, glad you're the one. Thanks. There's a guy at the, we gave everything it's due to the maroon's. He actually had a good time. Nice going sir. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. We're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're not discussing. We're discussing, we're discussing is what we are. What are these things? Oh, gross. Gagney with a prune, baby. I'd rather have my, if this is all I had to, this is the honest truth. If this is what I was my cuisine for the rest of my life. I'd rather have my taste buds scraped and just drink liquid protein. You know what I'm saying? Just sip it through a straw. Far preferable to eating this, swill. This unidentifiable, this unacceptable, this gross test. Due to Kaka, crap. I mean, you want a mouthful of, oh, that's a wrong thing. Yeah. Ha ha ha ha ha. Have you ever been to a beach or a main your store by the way speaking of, speaking of that? I'm trying to get in the front tummy. I can't take too much butter. It shoots right out my ass.

So through me to that, that's free time I can't take too much butter. I can't take too much butter as you order the Omra can't order the combination of that and all that's the two of the vitamin C I took the night before. You know what happens when you do when you take too much vitamin C? It'll make you sh**. Wow. 132 at 560 WCM. The George tells me that we begin all these calls off here. Oh, that guy was right. You got to try that coconut bar. That advantage bar. Because what's better than a piece of coconut is, huh? Here's a big report in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi Neil. Major figure for me. Yes sir. Southbound Farber at the command. You got the OT. You got FHP. You got the F3. Excellent. Also, big asses and sports. Did anybody mention a Kirby pocket? Yes. What did it? You know what they say to Kirby pocket, just say, have a nice day. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. I apologize profusely by the way. Because I have a very, you know, I have an audience out there. They're very susceptible suggestion. And I talked about the, and the only reason I mentioned the advantage bars is because, I don't want to mention George was the one who turned me on to that again. About how crystal is buying those by the sack full and about how, whatever you said. By the sack full and I keep asking for why. You know what it tastes like a sack full of that is what it tastes. And what does she say? She's getting, you got to eat something. Why? Oh, God. I'm serious. If I, I would have my tongue just chopped. Just all the buds scraped off. That's how bad they are. Here's a mobile in Miami Lake, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I don't know if you remember me. I'm the guy that gave you the big stack of cassettes one day at IOD. The sound effects. Oh yeah, how you doing? I'm doing fine. I just, I recently become diabetic myself. And I thought I would ask you a couple of questions. What, what do you recommend for a snack? You know, like things with no carbs. Because I've been looking at things and reading things very, very carefully lately. Yeah. And like, for instance, I can, I know I can drink diet coke. It's good. It would be hard with no caffeine. Right. But you say right, make sure it's no caffeine diet coke. Okay. Because like if you go on a plane or you go into a restaurant and you get diet coke, it's always going to be the kit with caffeine. Okay. And a lot of people that screws up your whole diet and you're not going to lose any weight like me. Okay. Well, I'm, I'm 61 and 198. So, as weight is not a problem, it's just keeping my sugars regulated. Right. Do you have any recommendations? I mean, I know that I can have like the sugar-free jello and stuff. Yeah, you know that. You have some slums in, or like, you know, cheese. Okay. All right. Well, not a lot. I mean, I mean, we should have continued something really exciting, but there's not a lot. Yeah. My mom says I'm going to probably starving the rest of my life. That's not true. Go on. Did you go to Ruth Christian have one of those gigantic, uh, revised stakes. You won't be starving. Wow. I also got to watch my cholesterol, too. That's kind of a... Well, I see, and again, you've got the wrong doctor because the adkins diet, in most cases, reduces your cholesterol. See, you've been brainwashed. You're, I feel I feel bad because obviously your doctor is a jack-ass. Well, it's, I noticed the�. Well, he looked at, well, I want, I want you to do me this. Okay. It's only got a costie about three or four bucks, because it's in paperback five six bucks. Go to your bookstore and get the adkins book. I'm begging you to do it for yourself. Okay. Dr. Racken's new diet revolution. Even though you're not an idiot, it's the best thing. Or better than yet since you are diabetic, go to the same bookstore. It's hardcover. It's a little more expensive. Dr. Bernstein, that, uh, diabetes solution book, right up your alley. Okay. Trust me. All right. The best investment you ever made in your life. I appreciate it. Okay. Good luck, pal. Thanks, but yeah. Yes, he got, he does all these things because he works in mysterious ways that God, and I know I'll see you in heaven, Dr. Mark. I'll aloeff the yesterday's hour and a half over there. I don't think you'll be there. I cannot word this scape me even a verbal tactician, like you're a truly. Cannot find the words to describe the hour and a half that I spent with my doctor yesterday. And when I walked out of there, I kept thinking of myself, who was the doctor and who was the patient? Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. How you doing, uh, first time long time. Yes, sir. And, and he must have just been there. And he must have just got cut off. He must have just got just flipped. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Miami Lake, so hello. Hello, nearer. Speaking. I have heard you for a quite a long time now. And finally decided to call you today. Yes, sir. The way you express yourself about God, tells me one thing about your persona. You must have a very, very sad child. Well, I did not. I'm pretty sure that your mom used to force you to go to the synagogue. No, she did not. We were not religious at all. No, my mom didn't force me to go and there did she go. I mean, what? Incredible. The way you express yourself about God. Because I have a different opinion. I don't believe all the phone. You belong to stuff that you do. It's not a matter of what is it. What is it? What is it? Incredible about what's incredible about it. Well, the bottom line is, if you believe in Santa Claus, you believe in the two fairy? No, I don't. Do you believe in the little green guy under the bed in God? Goblins? No, I don't. Do you believe in angels? No, I don't. How do you believe in God? Because of looking at the sky, looking at everything. I have the nature. Do you believe in nature? Of course I believe in nature. What do you need God for? Why do you have to be one question? No, you can't. What is it? How do I know if you'd ask me the question? How do we get here? I haven't got any idea. Do you? Do you have, do you know how we got here, sir? I know how we got here. Don't give me, of course. Do you know how we got here? We are created. Do you know how we got here, sir? I'm telling you. No, I don't tell you. Don't reach for an answer because you know that I got you trapped into a box. Do you know how we got here? Yes or no? Yes. And we were created by God, which is what? All powerful. Yeah, good. Yeah, then how come, how come we're eating atkins bars? Yeah, there we go. Check us. No, we were, we were creating. How did we get here? How did we get here? I mean, what are we going to do? What are we going to do? How did we get here? Sir, you wasted the right to your life. Wearing about stupid questions like that. How do we get here? And I'll worry about, we're going to rest in my life. Wearing about, what am I going to do now that I'm here? Until that magical day when it all ends because God works in mysterious ways. Just a measus in the disgusting way I speak about. God damn it. Several open lines all of a sudden after that debacle. We got 50 million open lines. Hank was just in here telling me about he almost had a cornery. He had an ear. I mean, we feel a lot better about that Hank and I. Because we're like teenagers compared to Riven, a piece of the arounders. Hope for all of us, baby. Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, on the 18, 10, 10, 10, 10. We're like teenagers compared to Riven, a piece of arounders. Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, on the 18, 10, 10, 10. We're like 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10. We're like, oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60, on the 18, 10, 10, 10, 10. We're like, let's hear from some more of the God people, okay. And I'll tell you one thing, if you, if you, if you, every one of those advantage bars and you can call me afterwards and say you still believe in God, then I give you credit. Then I'll say now, there's somebody with the courage of their convictions. Here's for Lauderdale. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. I had one of those browny hounds and hound is definitely the operative word on that bar. Yeah. That was um. As in, back home. God, how could any, seriously, you know, when you make a product, you know what I'm saying? When when a company manufacturers are products and they taste it. They experiment in the lab and they put all the ingredients together. How could anybody have manufactured those things, you know? How are these things? And what, and, and tasted them and said, oh yeah, well, the public will love these. Let's package them now. One word recycled, toilet paper. Oh, God, even Mr. Whipple wouldn't touch these. Let me ask you a question about the icons because I'm not really too familiar with. Can, what do you think about like, not, and I'm not making a joke about it. I mean, I like nuts myself. But can you completely own what they're attached to? Can there's certain types as you can either, because I don't know. I was, I was looking at some of the packages and some of them. If back when it comes to, I get about four or five. Perhaps another guy always say, Ray, what do you have to compare? But anyway, well, I'm not here in the book. He'll tell you that you have to be careful. You can have a limited amount of nuts, but like, you know, a few cash use, a few macadamies, but you can't overdo it because they're loaded with carbohydrates. But they also got that co-cube, something? Co-cube 10. Yes, which is where you, which you need. Which I'm taking, which is excellent. Which is great, you're right. Which is good. But you can take that in the supplement without taking the carbohydrates. So you're just looking to take the nuts as an excuse so that you can say, Oh, I'm taking it for the co-cube 10. I mean, if you're not okay, but don't overdo it. No, I mean, I'm not diabetic or I'm not, you know, extremely overweight or nothing. Well, I'm just a liar. Why are you interested in the acting? Because I don't like the all the sugars that I'm trying to lose some, some fat content, you know, It's right. Bring it down from like 19 or 20% of the power. Possible down to 15% of the time. Well, these advantages bars will do it. You won't need for weeks. You're looking like you're about praying in the bottom. All right. You'll be, you'll be, you'll be skinny and thin. You know, something, I bet you the last solid meal that Terran Carpenter Raid was a doctor-ranking advantage bar. I will never eat that again. I bet you that's what put her right over the edge. If that was my last, I was, you know, in prison for murder, and that was going to be my last meal. I just told him to go ahead and pull this way. Exactly. Just the, It's getting over me. Okay, pal. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, whoever, whoever turned this out of this crap, by the way, like for an hard get said, there's another one for it. I know another one. Oh, man. Oh, but you got to try to cope at a one. They're really great. See, I'm not, I'm sorry. A little bit of reluctant after eating these other two plus a part of the third, and I do mean you turned. What was the third one? The peanut butter, uh, direct one? Peanut butter, diarrhea? Oh, God. Seriously. Just, I want you to think of the worst meal you've ever had in your life. If you can single one out, we've all had to pretty much think of the absolute worst swill that's ever been pulled off on you as a meal. Multiply times 100, and now you're starting to eat warm. You're not close yet. You're starting to eat close. Just a little close. To just how to grow test, how terminal, how unbelievably bad. And now you see that guy that called before that is Mr. Fine or whatever day was, Mr. Not so fine. He's going to be psychotic. Oh, my God, you're going to kill me. You know, something I cannot tell a lie. Not about the little lie, maybe, but not a lie like this. You talk about credibility. Even Bubba's no is never grew that much. Oh, geez. I mean, this stuff, my dogs wouldn't touch these. Forget about what their mouth. They wouldn't touch it with their back. No, it wouldn't come close to it. Here's a mobile and water. Hello. Hey, Neah, how are you? Okay, sir. Yeah, I thought it was a bit as far as I think the coconut is probably the best of the bunch, but they are the worst. Right. I mean, they truly are the worst. The only thing that I have enjoyed out of that delight is their ice cream. But every top of the ice, I eat that ice cream. I stop losing weight. I don't gain any weight. Yeah, I just stopped losing weight. Yeah, that's true. But but Delver, you're delights didn't make these. These are made by the Atkins before the Atkins program. Yeah, I screwed in themselves. No, I'm talking about the advantage. They had their work. Yeah, well, they saw a lot of the products in there. I've tried most of the stuff they carry. Yeah. And I just assumed. Stick with the gel, I'll even know I'm sick of it. I stick with the gel. I'll just eat the whipped cream. Yeah. I'll just stick the whipped cream. I do just turn the whipped cream thing. I'll get one of those big ones with some of them. There's some of them. Zero carbs. And you shake it up. And it's tilting off the down. You suck it right out of the tube. Take that. And if you start doing that, it's for us. I don't know how you market those things. People actually buy them. They're expensive too. But not cheap. Oh, thank God. I got these for free. Yeah, they're like three bucks a piece. Are you serious? Yeah, three bucks a pop. Are you sure? Talk to pop. Oh. And they also sell some, there's like a fluid they sell. Think it tastes like a data rate. It's called a fat burner. It's made by some place that we call a spring. And that's pretty. Oh, I like that stuff. Yeah, it's really good. But that's also expensive. We're on deliver to the play. I'm driving a truck or live. I'm on deliver to the place that many factors. But I do know what you're talking about. That's pretty good stuff. Yeah, it's good. But all that science stuff is crap. Yeah, it's crap. Good luck. Good luck with luck. Okay. Yeah. Good luck to us all. Like little tiny Tim said. Because God has the big fixes in. Okay. If you like it, you're going to get sick. You're going to get fat. You're going to die. Because that's the way God works. Because like I keep telling you over and over again. He's one sadistic mother, baby. He just sitting up there laughing up his sleeve. In fact, if you pick up one of those, you go into your bookstore and pick up one of those disease books. You know, that's God. Well, it's mainly for physicians. But if you're a hypocondriac like I am, you can sit around. Kill a lot of good time at home. We need about all these various diseases. Every time you have like a little pain. Oh, you know, and you'll open that thing up. And you'll be astonished. It's all the thousands and thousands and thousands of diseases that exist. The things that you never heard of before. And don't forget God made. One of these things. That's right. Glenn, he gets pissed off of you now. You know.
