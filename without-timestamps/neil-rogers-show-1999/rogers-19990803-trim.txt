Now when he's feeling it's right free... ...I'll let him up behind the door. You got math free. And don't believe it's worth it's thing that it's all right. To get real high and grab the fat. Let me take you down to you and you've been somewhere... ...for a very few... ...while making drugs to you. And never come to check him out. Drop every breath forever. Drop every breath forever. Feel properly real, forever. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. You're one so... ...you're so big. All right. 10, I'll see you at 5, 60, and WCM happy Tuesday. There's a week earlier. Let's hear it. Let's see. A man of great principle. How about you expect... ...are you aware of the fact that they hear it? I heard a man with history? For a scrimmage. None of the exhibition games. Certainly not a real game. Not even a game. But for a scrimmage, the dolphin's head... ...16,000 asshole showed up on Sunday. How do you hear it? As Americans from coast to coast, they're running around with a big, big billboard saying, I have no right. All right. I wouldn't be surprised if we have people in this audience. Let's see how long it takes before somebody calls in this show. And admit they watched some of the last nights golf on ABC. Did I watch it? Did you watch it? No. Did anybody in this building watch it? I hope not. Well, I forgot about the sports nerds. Golf in prime time. How long you think it's going to be before somebody calls in and says, They watched it and even if they enjoyed it? And they would watch it again. And they taped it and they'd be watching it right now. Over and over again. While squeezing themselves vigorously. No doubt. Strawberry is not eligible to play on Wednesday. Let's hear it. How many chances more than they ever ready can. More than Alan Spaulding on guiding light. All right. You forgot to reset the phone. We were so busy doing all this stuff. And now we had a caller too. But you'll have to reset the phone. Here we go. Okay. I don't have to call again. Sorry. Yeah. We don't reset the phone. Airfree. Single day here are cheap. JCPenny equipment. I'm sorry. I apologize to JCPenny. Our cheap. Cresgis. A what what the dime store equipment. Doesn't work. She was going to grab it. Cool because it was the golf line. There's actually somebody on it. WQA and golf line. Hello. I actually watched golf last night. And I enjoyed it. Oh. Oh. Oh. And I would watch it again. No. Come on. I swear to you. I really know. How could you? I would enjoy it. Can I ask you one thing? What did they do since there was a match terminally. Two guys. What did they do to fill in the time in between while they were Sontering up the course? There was some perspicacious analysis. Yeah. By one or champion Curtis Strange. Oh. That's strange. Yeah. Yeah. You know what? It was quite boring between shots. Uh-huh. The golf was exciting. Right. Here it goes. Kind of like a porno movie. Forin between shots. Good score. But made up for it. I enjoyed it. I want to say congratulations. Sir to you for having the honesty to admit it. Thank you. Have a nice day. I think you're like that. There's an honest man. He watched it. I like that. He's golf too. What he's really trying to say is. I have no lie. And TV's pretty boring. See, I hate to break the news to all you fanatics out there. All you militant fill in the blank. I don't know if you're going to be a fan. But like I said a couple of weeks ago when they all brought this crap up a block. There's not enough black shows. His fans, we don't care. How about putting on a good show. Wow. What a concept. A show that might be entertaining. That's somebody might enjoy. Well, I'd by the way that horrible movie that we talked about yesterday, which I'm sure I get more calls about today. Just take it in money like hand over a lymph race. Let me just do that. I don't believe it. We'll do that. The Blair which, which will hand you the Tony. Whatever project. The Pup can, which ones got the Tony. So, evidently it goes to show you that hype really yourselves because everybody I talked to after the show yesterday I spoke to 750 two people. Some just like in the elevator run away downstairs and they were like gagging. I just mentioned the movie and they're peaking all over their shoes. So, we have a few people that watched the golf last night and a few people that are all excited about their strawberry coming back. Even though he's going to the mine is first, there's one of them just walked into our right now. A man with no principal whatsoever. Joe Costello, who's all excited that Darrell's coming back. Sterled Darrell. Although I noticed he's not wearing his Yankees out for today. Thank God for that. That would be a bad day to be wearing that thing today. On a disgraceful day in which commissioner Bud Light is hand calls him. Bud Light piece of turd. A turd with two legs. That's Bud Seely. A turd on two legs. That's him come back a week early and he'll report the triple leg Columbus of the International Aidimar and ready to rock and roll in. Your turd. It says he'll be about a week later and they'll call him up and there he'll be again. Swatting there Yankee City and he'll be swatting it. Yeah, so no is no is maybe. Piece of scum. Piece of I mean how many chances do you get? Steve Howell. And Hank is right. I heard him talking about that. That was a you know a pressure thing. Union. Oh yeah, that's right. You got to give another 20 or 30 chances. You got to get him back in there. Okay. Whatever you say. So I get a letter yesterday from the post office. See, this is that this is probably of no interest to 99% of the people in the audience, but I really don't care because I'm looking for it. It's just easy. So I don't have to make a call out. It's easier to take calls coming in. No, and after your postal customer, this is about my I have one of those Pitney pose postometers, which is a lot easier with all the damn bills. I have to pay in cinna five six seven thousand bills that I have to pay every month. So I like my postage meter. But nevertheless, I record indicate that postage meter number so and so is registered. You know, is overdue for the required examination. Oh, well, I'm a good agility for this day is out. An annual meter examination by a postal employee is mandatory for meters that are set remotely via telephone. The purpose of the examinations to ensure that the meter is in satisfactory condition, to protect your interest and that is the postal service in the event of a malfunction at your junction. The required exam is based on the anniversary day of the meter. Your meter was due for the end of the exam June 25 1998. I'm over a year late for crisis. Please take your meter in this letter. You're in your post office by August 1199 for the examination. And it's got a whole thing that they have to fill out here on the bottom. My answer is no, I'm not taking. I mean, the whole purpose of getting that is so you don't have to go to the post office. Exam and what? What are they going to examine? That's probably it. Probably you take your postage meter the post office and it guys has been over please. Yeah. Sixth finger deep inside your. You can take it back now. It looks okay to me. How do you like that? So maybe somebody can and because it seems to me I called the Pity most people last. You when I got a similar kind of notice and I said, What the hell is this about that? Oh, don't worry about that. It doesn't apply to you. Huh? They're very nice and very convenient, but not exactly what's going to the pokey for if you catch my grip. So maybe we have some postal nerd in the audience who can inform me what to do about that. Or to stick it. I tell you like men and they look like women. How young is too young? You come on to live with the things in my head. And some thought of but if you want to take me to the thing about me, I don't think you know. I'm on the way. You should make it any more. You put on a chair that you really want me to. All right. You landed a friend underneath. She was 25 but she's just how young is too young. You think me? I've been my name for three. Daddy called her cousin. Oh, I bet I'm perfect. You think because I'll have to tell me. None of my friends. She's my name. Not but you think right now, or my show. I don't see her. She's a little girl. She's a little big girl. She's just a big girl. And then rolling stones straight into the sky. And then rolling stones straight into the sky. And then rolling stones straight into the sky. And then rolling stones straight into the sky. By the way, Tom Boca Brian is stuff. We're in our facts paper. Oh, is that a wrap? Why not that? Why? We need that. But why couldn't he have brought this here? It was just here yesterday. The thing wasn't working yesterday. The thing wasn't working yesterday from one eye here. That wasn't the first day. And in fact, I hear more days often than not, however that goes. So we are going to get any information from you about this posted meter painting the As thing, are we? I mean, not that I'm so lazy that I want to have to slip that thing over to the post office and stay it online for half an hour. And then we'll walk up there with a stupid letter and have him look at me saying, What's that? You know, like, what are you doing here with that? Here's for a lot of Dale. Hello. Yes, sir.

Never looked too great, but nevertheless Now he's not only gotten I think the fatness is only accentuated the fact that he's now officially becoming an old man When you agree with that he's gone from the befo we knew befo He got like this and now he had the fat has accentuated the negative and made him into an officially fat man I was sad But anyway he came into this morning and pointed out which had already seen in the papers this morning much to my dismay The spokesman the organization is acted again Just to ensure that we have a spectacular year and don't miss to play off again this year.

He's the same guy who went on waxy and bought his way on the year for about five minutes and was gonna He was gonna like revolutionize talk radio in this town and it wasn't gonna be Confrontational and it wasn't gonna be off the wall and it was gonna be he was really gonna Address the problems and talk to living and breathing people on the phone in this town right That's so still on the air by the way. Oh, I think that even what's his name lasted longer Warren's full Marty lasted longer than Robert Steinbach on waxy One or whatever the minor league station is that we sometimes used to but oh and by the way By the way, are you aware I heard was it hang talking about yesterday? I guess managed mention it over the weekend that we're actually gonna put some dolphin games on waxy Because we have prior commitments with the marlins Are you ready for that? The only one of the sports enterprises on this radio station that we might make some money off of and anybody might possibly listen to that could possibly be worthwhile the dolphins And because we have that violin crap We're gonna have to preempt the mar of the dolphins and put them over there on seven nine to your sum other place. Thank God that we have to carry that often done FM too One thing I like about that seven ninety it did nice personal Yeah, it's great It's unconscionable it's unbelievable it's just like in the spring we had panther of backwit of panthers were playing in the playoffs Which wasn't the lately, but I can remember we had they had panther playoff games on waxy While the station was running crappy marlin games Nice going Greg see this is what happens when your plate gets too full even if it's good food that you're putting on your plate When it gets too full it starts filling off the edges It makes a mess at all over your nice panter Ivy league suit your dress or whatever you're wearing or your legs And it creates a mess instead of being palatable and delicious and wonderful and that's the problem with Greg Reed sports plate It's running over and most of it by the way isn't delicious Wonderful Sensational Appetizing or successful making money. You're gonna make money before I get to Robert Steinbeck's worst column in history So a screw-and comes in this morning just go into that way after yesterday I bitched her in a wholesale staff out about being bogus with the copy and they are I mean they're they're uncomfortable what they do and they're just no no concern here until I get the only tenders ever Response in your witness to this is when I get on here and scream about it Then all of a sudden they start running up here and she shows up with that look on her post and she brings in a folder I'll hear some client feedback sheets. Yeah, yeah, so I'm looking through these client feedback sheets Which all of the clients seem to be getting pretty good results except the ones that Todd Drec is got there They're all renewed, but they'd like to get more response He's I'll see he can never he can never say anything good It's always got to be lying mouth. They renewed for another three months, but they like to get some more response That's Todd Drec because let's face it. I'm a failure. He's the success Now, how'd you like his home phone number? So anyway the point I'm getting to is that in this in the middle of this folder This is better in the time green when he was given. I he was gonna give what's his name? Glenn Humpler he was gonna give Humpler so I fell number I was doing it like one number the time until he came in the in the studio life Here's the list of all the sales holes from WQAM They're home phone numbers their cell phone numbers their pages there are dresses their shoe size They're penis size which I noticed by the way next to Todd Drec there's a blank next to that one I'm sending that to the world shirts of hate all right Look at that one address isn't it's great? Here's how I'm silverstein first on the list and It's interesting. She how is this is supposed to be off of the pie by the first name, I guess Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha, nice going through and you're even better than I thought you were sweet heart Yeah, she's got an alpha of the times, but like the atoms are first Brian shults shoots shoots is Third it's by the first name. She's got an alpha of the size not by the last name which is anybody ever see a list like that. Oh no So if anybody wants one of our sales holes phone numbers and Guess who else is even on here? So if you want to borrow that big black instrument The one that's not connected We'll give you a phone number call up roll. Maybe you're loaded to you and the build-o-to This is great. I'm not letting go of this by the way This is in there is a mistake. I'm not letting go.

His home number the first number is nine All right Yeah That's nine five four by the way nine Or is Robert Rimmer the grim reaper would say yine Oh In fact anytime eight time he comes up here access for anything we always say nine And we give one of these little term and salute 21 before 11 at five 60 WQ and we'll get back to Robert Stein back. We had a lot of stuff going on here today Baby we got the asshwout of Turan let's hear our Jesus come on let's hear it for Jesus and for that Shout out of Turan I would be surprised if that thing's older than the fuselage, you know when you hear my down with older than What's his name your buddy? I've got a block Chris the bath house. I got a block on his name You know it because every time I started visualizing that post I get like oh and then guess who John penis brought in here this morning Who made Chris bath house look like He made him look like a roblo Made him look like a man human being David Horl from pop in a park nice gone penis you idiot David Horl show from pop in a park of all the people I'd rather see Todd Greck. I'd rather see Chris bath house. I'd rather see anybody Then to see David Horl show from pop in a park and he brings it in here this morning with the any particular reason No, just to be aggravating I guess nice going penis talk about truth and packaging Chacha This one what else what am I missing? Oh Dad I I'm a good Christian. I'm a good Christian. You're not even that deal, why? You're the fucking summer. So it's the hip on a day. You're the summer day, straight up. All right. I'm like, I don't know. I'm trying to tell myself, if I'm moving my gun out, who's every now and a half. I'm trying to tell myself, if I'm trying to tell myself. How about climbing the moon? I think that might be it. That's not it. That's enough to think it's going to drive me nuts. 16, before 11 at 5, 60, WQM, 20, we're Roberts Steinbach, who is just another legendary in his own mind. Tax vote sign of dim future he writes, whether my enemy, he goes on through this long horrendous grow, test bunch of gloom and doom, like the sky is falling. Because the majority of people, they overwhelming majority of people, said, no, that idiotic sales tax. And he goes on and on and on about the likes of automobile dealer Norman Brahmin, who's entity, toward mass transit, to be blindingly obvious, and the anxious role of Martinez, and Yadi, Yadi, in other words, every one of us who was against it was some kind of an evil evil piece of crap, with sinister motives. Isn't that what you're saying, Robert? You jackass, and by the way, nice show on whammy. Anybody on this ever here at? No. But here comes the best part. Residents, this trust the media. People often complain about, and of course this is in the Harold. Often complain about the Harold's diabolical attempts to control local issues, but the papers backing of the penny tax only demonstrates how powerless it is to sway public opinion. Right. That's the good news, Robert. That nobody, at the fact, whatever the Harold does, it says, we do the opposite. And with major corporations, including this paper's parent, he put them for parentheses, parent, medically, moving out and virtually none moving in, private industry also fails to generate confidence. It seems we trust no one, and won't believe anyone's vision of a brighter future for my enemy. Now, listen to this. This is the greatest paragraph ever written by man. Maybe I've been affected by my recent cross-country drive. I ran into countless people who loved where they lived, and virtually none who dreamed of coming to Miami. Let me see it again. During his recent cross-country drive, he ran into countless people who loved where they lived, and virtually none of them who were dreaming of coming to Miami. Do I ever met anybody who dreams are coming to Miami? No. In fact, any time I'm on a plane, I'm in a airport, I'm walking down the street, or just anywhere where there's a stranger and they say, hey, where are you from? And I say, Miami, they immediately go, oh, and run in the opposite direction. Looking over there's shoulder is they run. Robert, you're living in La La, man. And, you know, the horse is not only out of the barn, it's about 100 miles down the road already, and all of a sudden people like this answer, oh my gosh, what's going to happen now? It's going to get bad here. I hate to break the news to you sweetheart, but things are already pretty bad. It's already a pretty grim and gloomy place. That's why major corporations don't want to come here. That's why your parent corporation in the here, hold the ASAP to whatever the hell that was, silicone, valley, and California, because they'd count it unfortunately, is a toilet. And if people are responsible for being a toilet, are the same politicians that are trying to sell a bill of good now? That should explain you, let nobody's buying, Robert. Nice show, by the way. 560560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile in Fort Myers, hello. Good morning, Neil. How you doing? Okay, sir. A little off topic here, but I have to ask you some questions about the stand-on station. We have over here at WWCM. Yes, our white trash host of the morning, that I listened to as a warm-up for a little bit before your show comes on, is claiming that the station has inched up a little bit in the recent book that's out, and that you've gone into the crapper. Really? Last week, I thought you were saying that you were ratings were not as good as you've ever had. We had a great book over here. How come I had a call yesterday from somebody telling me just the opposite saying that the ratings were way up and that we did great? It would be real good if instead of doing all of this in secret over there, since we have no commit, this may come as a shock to you, that even though they open up a pot and carry the program, we have no communication with them whatsoever. None, zero, zippity, do-da. Wouldn't it be nice if they would like facts over to us since they have our facts number? Facts over to us, what the numbers were? I mean, I'm a big boy, I can handle it. I don't get paid a dime for being on the air over there, so whether we have a zero share or a 90 share, it really is of no relevance to a my existence in any way shape or form. Well, here's just the thing and the point that I wanted to make, seems that most of the new advertising that they're able to sell on this aesthetic little station over here, that we listen to you on, comes on between the 10 and 2 hour on your show. Yeah. I don't need any more money, but seems like maybe you ought to get in on some of that, I mean, I mean, I mean, I'd be embarrassed to take money for being on that station with the beesleys. But it would be very nice if they would have facts of us or call us or communicate with us and let us know what the numbers are because I'll be glad to talk about them on here. And I thought, the George keeps telling me that this guy that's on the morning show over there, Joe or whatever his name is, that this guy's a big fan of mine, which is what he tells us to our to George's ear to his face, but evidently every chance he gets to take a shot over there, which makes him feel a lot better about himself as human being. So he's got to be shot on the other line. He's the biggest Neil, it's a white trash audience, and he's the pander to the white trash over here. Right. The audience is just below us element of society, which we have plenty of over here in South West Florida. One last question, though, these books that come out, do they break it down? No, it's just like the station goes up, is it broken into time increments? Yeah, it's broken into like 60 10 a.m. 10 to 3, 3 to 7 and 7 and midnight. So it should be pretty easy to see if the numbers go up, that it's likely to be the next time. That's why I'm saying if they would let us know what tell the numbers were, I'd be glad to put them on the ear even if they were crappy. You know, one thing about me, every month when the trends come out and every three months when a rating book comes up, for years I've been doing this for over 20 years, I put the numbers on here. If we, we haven't had plenty of books that weren't all that great, and if they're not that great, we still put them on here. We're not sitting here in a lie about it like some people do. There you go. Well, keep it up. We love you over here, and I'm sure whatever ratings that they're enjoying, if indeed they aren't precinct or do completely and totally to your show. Keep in mind, this is a station that up until about two years ago, and never even showed up in the ratings. You got it. Have a great day. Thanks for the good news for Myers again, playing fast and loose with our lives, because that's the way to be easily green company operates. The left hand don't know what the right hand is doing. And since they, you know, can't put any original programming on over there, at least not to speak up, what they do is they open up a pot they put me on here, they put some a handgun, they chop stuff off whenever they feel like it. That's a great way to run a radio station. That's a great way because it's cheap. That's what they know how to do the best cheap. 560, 50560, pound 560 on the mobile one line. 2 300 open lines on here for you. Are we going to hear from them in four Myers? No, maybe the cats got their tongue. I mean, do they actually have somebody running the board over there while they're sure it's on a must have to play this bot? Like a living and breeding person? Who's making at least 275 an hour? Here's a mobile in four-laterdale. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing, sir? Good. That news for you. They're going to be announcing a stadium for the Marlins. What do you mean they're going to be announcing a stadium? In other words, we're going to wake up in the morning and they're going to say if you look out the window, there it is. Yeah, I guess John Henry's going to put some of the bill in and he's going to get over the boxes and it's going to be built in downtown Fort Lauderdale. Why is that bad news? If he wants to pay for it, I couldn't care less, except that it's going to jam up traffic and nobody's going to be able to get there. Exactly, but I mean it's no longer. I guess maybe a taxpayers burden anymore, but they get some bad news because you know, there's going to be more baseball on the way out of the hall. By the way, next Wednesday we got a one o'clock in the giants. We'll be here next Wednesday. Mark it under count. We get out here tomorrow 30. Can I get a request, sir? Yes, sir. The prison. Okay. I have a great day. I'll think about it. It's getting ponderous. 567 just like sitting here looking at an almost empty board is getting ponderous too. I'll turn it that's getting really freaking ponderous. 567 0560 pound 560 on a mobile one line. Life in a vacuum. That's the way it is when you work with measly greed. Life is in a vacuum. I said this yesterday. It's true. You're shows in a vacuum. Everything you do is in a vacuum. You're coming to your little room. I leave here yesterday and along the whole the world is coming to an end. I mean rain and thunder and lightning. I get home. My little dog is nowhere to be found. He's hiding under the bed somewhere. It was like the end of the universe. And I'm sitting in here in a totally enclosed room. I have no idea what's going on outside. We have no news department. We have no weather department. Like last week one day when the turnpike was all screwed up back up miles southbound. And we had nothing about it here on the year because we're like in a vacuum. Like I said before. I got my nice little TV up here. Oh look at that. So hot zone baby on MTV. Oh yeah. Something for everybody on there right now. I got that and we got our satellite dish all free. All thanks to our own ingenuity. And they've given us basically a bunch of crappy old equipment that even nice there's wooden cell or so in pairs. Even radio shack would laugh at this crap. And that's it. Not that I'm complaining mind you. Although I'm going to start complaining a lot more because that crap about that in different routine that guilty sold me doesn't work with this outfit. Doesn't work at all because as soon as they get that signal that you become as indifferent as they are and that they want you to be then all of a sudden they just really slack off. Then they do nothing. Hey by the way anybody want a more sales department phone numbers? Huh? 560560. WQAM. Okay nice talking to you. 560560 and pound 560 on a mobile one line. Here's Miami. Hello. New. Yes sir. Okay. I was on you know what's the yesterday and I want to ask you a few questions. Um, can you tell me what what that book about for well the faint is about. Is it in there? Yeah there you go. Yeah it's a guy who used to be a preacher and the who realizes that it's all a bunch of bookrap. It's a great book. Yeah that's what I think because we'll look at it. The church as always accommodated themselves to like the changing times and whenever it's been the most convenient for them. They've changed their entire philosophy that I think so. You know I mean I used to be a Catholic you know when I was a kid but I I mean I got out of all of our crap. Um, another thing that I would be for they had a chance to alter you was done it. Uh, yeah and also I was I was looking at your contract I had I saw you had a few years left. What are you gonna do after three years? You're leaving her get her a new air. Well I'm getting out of here man. Oh yeah. I know from the Europe. I'm going with the people are a little more civilized. You should go like don't go to a place like London or that one no where they'll charge you there and go to the bathroom and crap like that of the department stores. Mm-hmm. Hey, um, can I learn how I crap into the department store for a free myself? Um, can I request a song? Yes sir. Can you play the share? Do you want the share? Do you believe in the last game? Okay. All right. What is that called by the way the share or a lesbian thing? Do you believe in now? What is that called? I can't believe she's a what is that called George? George is on a phone with somebody I have no idea. With us four miles. Oh, with four miles was on a phone? They only got the numbers minutes ago. Joe Scott the morning guy who is your biggest fan and declares it vehemently. So that guy is one of their chronic ozone provocateur. Oh, chronic fire. Oh, chronic fire is all totally wrong. That is chronic colors from the West Coast now. Oh, Jesus Christ. They only got the numbers minutes ago. They haven't even looked at yours yet to say. Well, how many of them? Oh, they've also said that they're talking about the numbers. They were mistaken. Yes. You'll be getting them shortly. Yeah. And so there you go. And we don't know the only mention that they made about you is that let's see what Neal's numbers look like when they come in. But Joe Scott of the Joe show in the morning is your biggest satisfying. Okay. That's for you Joe. All the way. Usually, don't kiss on the first date. What the hell is that share thing called? I can't believe she's a lesbian that has got wants to hear. What is that called? Can't believe she's a lesbian. That's not what it's called. She's a lesbian. No, it's not called that. Oh, yeah, it is. Okay. It's coming up in a minute. Oh, we got to do the break first level play. Because you sounded like a living and breathing person under the age of 100, which is what we're looking for here on this radio station. There's an envelope for George. I wonder what's in it. Oh, my God. Look at that. It was not good enough that George yet today finally got his check for that first appearance he made for two people showed up. I'm sorry. Where nobody showed up. Yeah. Why should you get paid for an appearance where nobody shows up, by the way, Mr. Hot Shot? But that was at all about. It's a couple of people shut three people. But I got paid. Good. Let's hear it. George finally got paid for that appearance six months ago. And a few smart. He'll be doing a lot more appearances that that boy sets up if you ask me before he goes off to radio on more. And how come faculty will never go to any more ratings numbers? Probably because Maddie beat him by a mile. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60, on the AT&T line. It's all request Tuesday. We're trying to make it desperately this next month. To the month of August. Can we do it? You think? No. When you're looking to put something new on your feed. Am I doing the right spot, by the way? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. Oh no. This is the John Pinos' fault, by the way. He's stuck a brand new copy and moved back road folder. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. No matter how hard it's right. Can't get further day to gather to power it is. She will touch up his name. She has to be angry vain. It's too hard and believing. Call the three and relax their stun. She dated guy who's really hunt for. I can't believe she's a Latteian. Yeah, Latteian, Latteian, Latteian. You must be something wrong to keep gay. I really don't know where I went wrong now. I can't believe she's a Latteian. I feel Latteian, Latteian. I really don't know where I went wrong. Made a key hurt, done a thing I saw. That's full like the use. We are 1103 at 5.60. WQM. So anyway, here's a facts from our best post personal friend, Joe. We see over in four of our minds. Let's deal with that call or that jacket. He's an Ojo provacitor. Yeah, he's a piece of crap as what he is. And you know, how are we supposed to over here? I know all the chronic colors in this market. Believe me when I tell you. Many of whom call this radio station frequently like that Joe guy. That sports guy with the thick voice that makes my skin crawl. Oh, God. Because one thing about this station, the rich are sitting screening out the calls if they have anything controversial to say, but they don't care if you're chronic. That's one of the problems. I guarantee you we'd have been number one by a hundred miles in men 2554. And why shouldn't we be? Do we have any competition? No. Other than life. So anyway, getting back to the facts from Joey See over in four. So this guy calls up their all of time is a professional trauma. Met a trouble like a window life. I don't want to get personal, but you're sure because I don't know you. But we hate you. Everybody here hates you like poison. And we wish you would die a wicked mean spirited death. Whatever a mean spirited death is. Don't we? Uh-huh. And by the way, get off your stuff. You're right. Because the facts I got says, thanks for helping us. And believe me, they need some help. It says the last four miles call is full of crap. No communication is tough and five sixties fall. Get off your stuff. Get off your stuff. Get off your stuff. Yeah, it's his fall. He's to be making up these stupid schedules over and over and over again. Round a clock with these stupid schedule. Get off your stuff. Yeah, that's it. That's his deal. It's tough spot. Not mine. So Joey see. And I would agree with you sir. The station is automated except for you. And I have to guess the length of stop sets. Your number four and men 25 to 54 and number five 18 to 49 men. We're all in Neil fans. Me since 1980 said Joey see. And his last guy is full of crap, but get off your stuff. Yeah. How do you like that? See, it's this and I believe it because I see the way these people operate with everything that goes on over here they're unenvolved. So certainly anything that goes on over there that we don't make any money from. They're not going to be able to get out of the house. They're going to be involved in that. They're going to make any kind of an effort. This place where they don't even service to God. They're not. First not. These are people were surrounded by people. I hate to put it in these terms. Some of them are nice people. Like get off your stuff. He's not a bad guy. Never stole a freight train. I'll open him. A little on the adult side. But nevertheless. But they're sliding through life. They're fumbling their way through life. And then the book comes out. And then we go through the roof based on the fact that you're listening to me for example. Or listening to some of the personalities on the station. And then they go, oh yeah, we're great. We're great. Every place I've ever worked in this business. It's always been the same. Remember the boy Jerry Days? If we ever had a bad book. And of course we did. Over those nine or ten years. I was like, I would do that. We had a book that weren't all that great. And he come in with the big sheets fully out for get amounts in there. We need to put the numbers on here. Like I have for a hundred years. And he walked in with a fistful of a paper. And it looked at me with that little frog. Oh, we stuck. We stuck. And every time he was saying that, I'm going to say, no, you suck. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I think the hunk of my degree with that. That guy started was fun. Yeah. Boy, did they hate each other or what? I'm like poison. And even though Hank is full of crap, I didn't tell you about all the money he wins of the track. How come we never hear Hank at a cappling town about all that when he lose the ranch of the track? Only about all the cash. But nevertheless, he was sure why it on target when it comes to boy Gary. I was going to hunker. God was he a jackass. We suck. And then if we have a good book, oh, we're great. We're number one. Yeah, we. We like what time is your show on you asshole. Boy Gary and Steve Nichol. And by the way, get off your dog. Yeah, get with it. Okay. Well, how much would it cost to make a call before it fires? Oh, that's right. More than we can afford. Probably sorry. Probably more than they paid for that dim. I'm sorry. It's a pieboard disc with these got to an it. I'm sorry. It's at the pace. What do they call that stuff? Particle board. Particle. That's what I'm looking for. Particle board. That's what his desk is made of. Particle board. Sitting in there like it. Like at a height here. This is the program director. And guess what's in the sham. It must be on vacation or something. I'm getting laid. He's got an office. 55 times the size of the so called program director's office. You know, get off your dog. Maybe that's why he doesn't want to get off his dog. Maybe that's why he does the minimum possible to decide his way through life. Even though he is getting paid. $1 a year, which is a hell of a lot. Forgotten makes up the schedules. But nevertheless, we like him. We just wish he would do something with our four Myers people. See, number four men 25 54. That might sound very impressive. The only problem is in four Myers. What have they got? Five stations I think. So I mean number four out of what. So thank you, Joey. See, forgiving me that information. But it isn't really very elucidating. What we don't know what the story is. Or what the number is. Do you follow what I'm saying? In other words, the top three stations might have like 15 years. We might be number four with the zero point two or something like that. So just knowing what number we are. And may say, and we're not looking to have our ass. Okay. We're not looking to be. Licked all over. We had nothing here to last a week with a great number. Get off your dog over here, which are the ones that count. We're just looking for a little truth and packaging. Is there anybody listening over there? Except that crusty old fart, who we all hate like poison and which would die before noon today? I'm calling my close personal friend, Mickey Daines and some such a believer in psychics. And going to have a put a curse on that guy. We don't even know his name yet. We'll find out, we'll come and get you pal. You piece of crap. You old disgusting foul. Have you ever like sat in the restaurant down here? And you see the old people sitting like, you know, way in the back. Thank God. And you heard, ah, I caught you know what I called it? I call it the death rattle. It's the soft word of death rattle. When they start the hacking cup and you can just you can just feel it. The pounds and pounds of flim. The gallons of flim just come puking up from 50, 60, 70 years ago puking up through their system. And you have to be treated right in the middle of a nice dinner. To listen to it. I was like that. The death rattle. And sir, I hope they rattle your cage and you get it before the day is out. You jackass that called us before. I'm pulling me before. So I haven't I told you this for a hundred years. The chronic colors. They're all mentally ill. Haven't I told you that? George. Yes. And it took you while. But you finally found out that I was absolutely correct. Not to mention anybody in particular like Greg or Andy or any or Mitch from the video joint. Chronically chronically twisted. Yeah, exactly. They make Chris bathhouse look like a normal and they make David the lunches name horror show. Look like a real guy. And that's a naughty. Oh, yeah, and Woody. Not Woody Graber. We're talking Woody from Hollywood that is also known as Steve when he calls the sports shows. Another chronic regular call around the station. But of course the people here that work here. They're oblivious. They could talk to the same six people every day. And as long as they get a call here and there, they don't give a crap. Maybe that's why they're underreachiving. You don't want to say a little bit of underreachiving there. Couldn't be that it's boring. Why don't you go back to cure for your spik baths. I'm really proud of it. Music and it's stored in there. By now you're all familiar with my brother up the rock, last six American women, where I add it my own guitar style. Music Music Music You like his so much, I decided to cover other rock drugs. Like smoked on the water. Music Music They're got her to be there. Oh, there's a lot of water. There's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Oh, there's water. Yes, Rose. And any garbage covers rock glasses. Now available. So we're going to get the car. I'm only sending your proof of purchase. We're a chance to win and then you get to our just like the one I play, Chad Don Delz or ever see these results. You get little credits better. Rucks classic. Alright. Okay. 11, 16 at 5, 60, W2, I've got thank Goldberg show it to. We got, uh, oh no. See, where you're going along so well. We had managed for four solid hours last night. Even I listen a little bit in the car. Tonight we got the Donnie baseball at six and then a pregame show at six 30 to fillies here in Talon and Marlins. We got more Marlin crap back on. That's our pool question. Which would you add in here? Jim Manage for four hours. Yeah, or stupid Marlin King. Is that a tough question? No, how sad. How sad. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound five, 60 on the AT&T. Warmus line. Here's Pemberpine. Hello. Hello. Yes. Well, I wasn't in 10. I just wanted to know if you were to stand to me. I was wanting to know if you enjoyed the food. My brother brought you a few weeks back. Well, it's not that. You sound like my old friend met. I'm not. No, no, no. Who would brother brought us? What was that? Uh, your friend Danny. For me, day days. Me, days? Yeah. Hallopingo poppers. Oh, that was great. Yeah, our good, close best personal friend Danny. How can I forget him? Right. Yeah. One that brings me those stats at the Panther games. Yeah. And in fact, he'll be bringing me a lot of those Chris Wells goals this year during the year. The games. Yeah, it was great. They let Chris Wells on the ice now. Yeah, they actually signed him for another year because they just want to keep slapping us in a face with him. He's like a weapon. Good lord. Yeah. Actually, I think he's playing for other teams now. He's just in a. Oh, he just they're going to ride the bench. So you know, he's going to be sitting in the crowd in the suit. He looks good. He, he sits big in the stands in a suit. Uh, man, I call someone to do spagging him. Yes, sir. John Roberts, you're a douchebag. Okay. And tell Danny, we love him. All right. Okay, see. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. What are we going to eat today, by the way, huh? Since my blood sugar was 79 this morning. I'm going to go and deal. Well, that's because I had to take an extra pill last night. Because somebody brought home ice cream and it wasn't even been in Jerry's. I don't want to mention that was good. That would be bad to mention that. It was okay. It wasn't been in Jerry's dog. You know, I'm sitting here all day and I'm looking for that guy. Damn song. Why? I don't know. Because I want to find that one line. But that's not the most important part. It's one of those things he becomes stubborn and obstinate when you can't find something you keep looking for it. By the way, KJ, it's not strange things in my box. Listen to it again. That's no. No. No, no. But I do that too. It's, I think it's that too. The smoke gets in your eyes. I think smoke gets in your eyes. But obviously, it's already in that. Do smoke gets in your eyes. That's not what he has sung. No, it's got nothing to do with anything like that. He says, I'm checking out baby. And then Nelson, right, a lot of his orchestra. Where's Nelson? Nelson, Nelson's dead. I mean, I've played it 50 million times. We scoured it here. We took old books. We took go into the DCS. We went through every guy dancing. It's over. And then we find it. No. Not that it's going to change my life if I don't all hear it is. On our CA. Order now and receive a free poster of the Verified with your CD. All right, the Verified. So anyway, 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T line. If we decided what we're having for lunch today. Something atkins perfect by the way. So I don't have to go screw it up. You might blood your drug since it started to 79 this morning, which is so nice. Any ideas? Why do we ask Jason? Okay. He's the one that's always pushing this around for the free food. W2QAN. Hello. Yes, sir. George. Yes. How are you doing? Great. Hey, the song you're looking for. Yeah. One foot in the grave. One foot in the grave. God bless you, sir. Have a good one. Thank you. I'm going to get this audience. Oh! God! God! What is great? How do you like that in the night, sir? Yeah. No, we've never got it. One foot in the grave. I say, then I have no chance to be saved. And see the light now. I'll be checking out. Oh! This for the night is full. The chamfer's not the port. I wasn't posing. Very soon I'll be. He composed English and the ending of. Soon I will be with you. Who's the baby? One foot in that grave. Someone for Barbara. I've got one foot in the grave. Oh, right. He's the law surprise that I am still alive. Inside, in 95. I don't think I'll sing today. My life is fading far away. Whoa! May it prove the light. This is surprising. It's not think I'll sing. That's unerizing. Not bad for a guy. Who's one foot in the grave. Who's who maybe self-sumptial with a self-sumptial with? Where is self-sumptial with? Barbara was my lucky object. I'll check it out. Oh, right. This is I am so I've got a chill in my left arm. I've got a restaurant in that tall. That was one of the greatest moments I've been in here. He's 78 years. That was one of the highlights of my broadcast career. That's for you pal. Whoever you are. What an audience. They don't have too much to say. And it's the dog days of the summer. And I'm sitting in here. Pump it in his numbers. Pump it in like crazy every day. Banging and playing and hoping for a response. But nevertheless, when push comes this job. When the crap is on the line, they really come through. That was incredible. And by the way, where is Nelson? 560, 0560, pound 560 on the 18T wireless line. There is self-sumptial. That was fast. Excellent. George is on top of it. It must be a little over. And I just a little spill over from the drugs from the weekend. You said it's wearing off a little bit today. Yesterday, we were a bit of good day. Oh, yeah. In fact, yesterday, we would remember the name of the bit. Not today. Because those drugs are wearing off. I'm like cocaine, which we've eaten the newspaper this morning. Perfect your mental state for like over a month. Yeah. Bad article about cocaine. I've always told you that white powder is a killer. It'll destroy your lives. Stay away from that white powder. Anybody comes near you when it just takes a powder. Like those farts as an Amsterdam. Gork, crack, crack, just don't get lost, baby. Or just keep walking with your eyes straight ahead. Like you ignore them, which is what I always do. Those shows that I'm stood on. Why can't we find some shows with some good stuff? You know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I'm not. I'm just going to play that one foot in the grave thing. I think from now on to a clock. I'm getting the chills. I'm getting the willies from the hearing that. The willies in the woody's. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami. Yes, sir. Are you doing great? Hey, there are three ten seconds. I'm going to have a full booth. Okay. Okay. Hey, sir. You're not functioning. I'm not. You're not doing me. Just let it be. Did you just go on? I'm going to board my brains out. Yeah. I'm losing my mind here. Okay. I thought it became a human being. I thought it pulled my head out of my ass. I rented done that work. Really? That's fantastic. Oh, no. One year's screaming to yell. That's good. It had an effect on. I'm going ballistic. I'm behind some schmigege. We think that a dollar bill is exact change. I love that way. I love that word by the way. I love that word by the way. Shmigege. That's one of my favorite English words in the world. Yeah. I'm going to get a few of them in this town. And, anyway, I want to thank you for turning me on the out movie. It's a fantastic movie. And the only thing I got to say is this whole town is one big, Howard Beal Show. The only problem is no one's going to pull the trigger at the end. Right. God bless you. It's like his one. Okay. And happy. Tissue ball. What is it? I don't know which one it is. She was. 560560. Just what I said, man. We get great information. But no response. We got 600 open lines here. And only 3.5 hours to kill the two of us. It's going to be just like yesterday again. Isn't it? And tomorrow will be the same way. And no, I don't want to talk about the guy named sales tax again. She that was the problem. You know, we wrote that for a couple of days. There really big about two and a half days. Got everybody whipped up into our frenzy. And actually got people excited about something in this town in a middle of the summer time. And they did magnificent job. They overwhelmed him and came out and voted. Oh, didn't I stop on that. But now it's like, okay, what do we do now? What do we do for an encore? But it got any suggestions? No. Let's talk about that Blair, which stupid movie for a couple hours, which I didn't see. And guess what? I'm not going to go see. If I need to go, I can just go out and drive on any highway down here for about 20 minutes. That'll do it for me every time. If I need to get dizzy and feel like the room is spinning around like a guy named Dradel and Heath. 560, 50560, pound five 60 on the AT&T wireless line. And like I've told you before, most people including most of you, unfortunately, you don't do your own thing. And you let somebody else run you around by the nose. And so I'll, I'll bunch of idiots who got to do it. Say, oh my god, this is the greatest thing. This is so unique and so different and so exciting. And you're rushed right out there to see it. Without talking to like an expert like George, he would have told you that's a piece of crap. And you could have saved your five or six bucks. And you could have gone and right didn't network for like two bucks. And see the really good movie. That's right. Or got five of the parts along to 100. And whatever you do, J.P. Don't ever give an order like that again. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. And here. Yes, sir. That one movie. Why? Why open or something? Yeah. Why open? The first 5000 suckers that went to see that. And they realized it was a bad movie. They made that on a media fight for that one up. Yeah. Listen, you've been at the Krom Avenue. I just drove by the home detention center of the country. Yeah. I got like a big 10 out of here with people that like I guess, so just dying. They're not eating or something. Have you seen that? No. I don't want to right after the show though. I just, like a 10 and I guess I'll never give our free lunch. They're starving themselves. They're doing a hunger strike. Yeah. And they got signed all up and then there's just people who are sitting and watching them die. I mean, it's like they're really seeing it. Great. And also, if you've been to this, make a 50 gambling thing out of here. No. No. If you just about 30 stories, it's a big hotel and a few. No. I know. And I was just wondering, like, what the odds are on? And they regulate, like, say, Vegas would be. Or did this big rip off? You know what I mean? Are that? No, I mean, you know what? No, you can go out there and win just like an Hollywood. You're the so huge. Yeah. Well, take a look at that. You'll be amazed. It's a big building they put up out there. Okay. I'm coming right out. Okay. See, I got to go to Hollywood first because that's their fine sponsor. By the way, the good news is because they dropped out on TRL for one day. They got B.D.S. for number one on TRL a couple of days ago. You know what? What number one was, don't you? Your favorite, which is a real piece of crap. One of the worst pieces of TRL I have ever heard in my life. But what was number one again last night? And you know what's going to be number one today because it's the last day. I don't know. Do we have any idea how long they let the songs stay on before they move them out. They retire them today as they'll be terminated for it. But this. And by the way, the show of the impact the best reports have made even on the guiding light. Yesterday one of the world's great shows and they brought the real Harley back just in time to deliver the baby. While Allen is recovering from his 18th heart attack and they get his heart beating in for the 19th time. And they bring the original Harley back and she has a little boy. And so her stepdaughter walks in and says if you decide it on name yet, she knows. And the stepdaughter says, how about how are your AJ or Nick? That's right. And Harley says, no, no back street boy names, please. And everybody goes. Yeah. So anyway, be that as it may. I was going to play this back to the phone. So we go Luigi's on the phone with Brian. Yeah, I want to know what's going on. I have come Chris and Randy. I interviewed a new one instead of the first thing. I mean, what's going on here? What are you trying to show us? Something here? What's the deal? You can take some questions? What's going on? Luigi, you were able to call in, weren't you? Yeah. Well then, what do you worry about? I'm worried about because it's unfair. What's going on over there? What, you have any questions? Do you have any questions? Do you have any questions? Do you have a coach, Luigi? Luigi, you got any questions for the coach? Yeah, I got a question for him. Well, that why I got asked the question. I'm not worried about whether Jeff and Joe were asking the question. You got a question. Ask it. The question is, when is he going to get fired? I'm in here. He's boring. It's fucked. Yeah, soon I think. Chris, well, get signed again for one more year. Oh, I'm here. I'm in our close personal friend Andy. Couldn't have been here. At least long enough to see Chris well is getting signed again. He would have gone in had a couple more beers. We met you Andy already. There was the good Andy as opposed to the evil Andy. 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Speaking of it, it's me Andy. How are you? Oh, yeah. Great. How do you like that? And I will actually leave it on the air. Just to show you how psychic I am. And what an absolute unbelievable asshole this punk is. Are you ready for that? I was in such a good mood after that guy called before and gave me that son of a bitch. And speaking, I want to foot in the grave, Andy. Isn't that interesting that you should just have an a call? You hope maybe there's a coincidence there? More than just a coincidence. In fact, two feet in the grave sounds real good. In fact, let's get a package deal. The guy from Fort Myers and Andy from Hollywood. Oh, yeah. A tofer. Tofer the price of none. Can we decide it on lunch yet, by the way, although I almost lost my appetite just now. I'm waiting for a call back from Maydays hearing that disgusting obnoxious ubiquitous voice. What? That guy mentioned Maydays remembered any brother calls. Yeah, but I can't eat that stuff again. Or you can be a hick again tonight. Who do they have? Have everything. What? Yeah. Oh, finally it is all Maynew bond. Have you seen this bond? Like steak stuff, lobster, what? Have you seen this bubble the first spot with the kid in school and they're sitting there on class and the announcement comes about his diary medicine is waiting at the front of the house. And he's got a finger in his nose searching for gold and just digging and digging and they got him up on the big diamond board on the screen up there. And everybody is looking and looking for Amazon for Arizona, whatever the hell like the gene thing is. Nice going, baby. Oh, two winner. WCWM Georgia's ordering lunch. Hello. Okay. Nice hearing from you. See, every single time I would say 99 times out of 100 when that happened, you notice how they vanished because it's usually some asshole. And when I pick him up, cool, they're all 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pawn, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless one. You know, people say I should write a book and I should write a book. But not about all this stuff from the last 23 years in his market. I should just write a book only on the psychology of talk radio. People have called radio talk shows. Because I'm one of the few people anywhere in the world who will tell you, again, it was the same way. We're probably the only two who will tell you that most people, call talk shows are like read, especially the regulars. They're real sick. Really, really sick. The chronic regulars. Like the other day, we had the guy from the really eyes who was on there for about 2 and a half seconds screaming somebody's name that never got on the air over and over again. In search of an identity, in search of a life, in search of a purpose. Here's my, any. Hello. That's going, Neil. Okay, sir. Those are the most institutional people like a anti there. Yeah. They do. God knows it. You need to use it. It was rubber walls. It's almost getting a little bit boring. I hear a little tropical depression and the tropical waves. You don't have a little Brian norcaught bringing hurricanes all the week. Africa with his hands over here. But they were having an nervous breakdown about that storm yesterday. Boy, I was looking. It was a bad storm. Like the end of the world. And he was hopping up and down there last night like Rumble Stillskan. Yeah, it was pretty bad, I guess. I thought he was going to take off in the orbit. Yeah. a don though you know that's who they are in that commercial again but you know not whipping up everyone in front of you I love don't yeah very good he's very good you know really that's boring here man it's terminal I don't know how we're gonna make it through the next month to labor I have no idea well we always think the fun the way and all these people you know you know hyped up about the dolphins and scrimmage and all this I need to say that a thousand people go to a scrimmage it's not even next to a vision game it's not any kind of a game it's a scrimmage and because it's so goddamn boring here 16 thousand people show up at a scrimmage that can be his era the greatest commentary on what this town's all about there is no way you can get me to sit in 95 degrees right and under there's 187 on the field and I'm dark complexity enough and God knows if I stay on the sun then you longer I'm almost going to be transparent there's no way you can give me the stuff like one d has pretty soon with any more sun if there's no talk about that a also no I mean mere mere penellers I'm so glad to that vote went down I know that's all news but I just had to call mere penellers or stronts all right okay and back at you he's a struns that mayor pinga a struns 560 50560 pong 560 on the AT&T wireless line we got 60 or 70 thousand lines open here waiting on practically because like this last guy says this is so unbelievably boring our first call is more than he was responding to a question I asked but the first call this morning he admitted he watched the golf last night and actually enjoyed it how do you like that found it entertaining oh man can you imagine if we only had the commercial networks we didn't have you know the small dish or at least cable with about 600 channels and I'm gonna tell you right now I got the big dish the small dish and the cable which means I got 75 thousand channels and most of the nine there's still isn't anything worth watching on it that's the best part oh the quantum spend you know 7 or 8 or 10 grand on that HD TV for what I don't care how clear it is are how many black people around it are white people for Hispanics or uh crackers how about something entertaining would be good that 48 hours last night wasn't too bad is that what it was the two little kids that had a well shoot daddy made you really know that the forced sterilization should be real big in the south that's where we start with it in the deep south how that was meals forced sterilization program she shifts my rear end until noon at 560 WQM we got high golbert in the studio I believe it to a clock and then we got that dolphin thread that the marlin craft starting at 6 with Donnie B and a pregame at 630 and it fell here in my end anybody go to that?

girl right you know they pulled the one where she goes into the Italian restaurant they only ran that twice they got such crap from the uh Italian American to keep it up for crying out loud what's wrong with them if they lost their sense of humor it to me that was the best commercial she comes in she's doing the old godfather right i love hey overstepped you know that was my favorite one that was the best one they pulled that after like two or three days it's got so much of the anti uh defamation league you know it's like that well you know i remember when the godfather the first one came out in 72 or three whatever was in uh i remember on the today show and hosting it then was the illiterate geododgeola who of course happened to be from kiny hill in St. Louis in oparagio yeah yeah yeah yeah and they had these uh pre-stone and a guy from the Italian defamation league and the church was psychotic about it and they and at a meantime it's still made millions and everybody in the world of singing like the priest had just wrote the book but yeah right i got to get a hold of that by the way but the greatest thing is when you're sitting in Italy and a trotteria and they always have some Italian music playing in the back you know like music and then the godfather music comes on and this is there you don't know whether the screen or lamp or are both great well they used to be

way you know where the fork and the napkin speaking of the vision causeway let me give you a hint the fork and the napkin were invented in Venetia Venetia Venetia Venetia but anyway go ahead and there's all actually some bridges there and everything's kind of styled and the old you know Venice tradition they're the bridges have they even they've rebuilt most of the bridges they're the one bridge and a lot of really smelling water around you can do it without the Venetian water or the Venice water but anyway this the story gets back to this see even he's falling asleep go ahead I'm

the car because you guys can send another inspector out but he writes a few other things down you write a few things like this and that and the other thing the next guy comes in this is a civil day's later because they write a whole different scenario once I've ripped the floor up the third guy writes a completely difference scenario and here's the I don't want to door here the final of the the outcome of the whole thing is the mortgage company says well we've approved the place yeah I said well what what what about these you know these out you know it's it's what is wrong to come to please

Okay, and stop being a pain in the ass. Now all of a sudden he's paying attention. Here's a mobile in Boka. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Let's get you here. I got a quick story here. We'll click for you. Talking about how young's too young? Yeah. I was seeing this girl for a while about three months. How young is too young? Exactly. I was seeing this girl for three months, right? And I was seeing twenty one years old. I'm twenty two, right? Right. And I met her at a club. So I figured she was at least twenty one, right? Or just girl. You know, I mean, she looks like she's twenty one. Exactly. We were going out for about three months. And one day I'm going through a purse, right? Yeah. She's twenty three. And I came across her driver's license. I looked at it and I figured out her age. She was only fifteen years old, right? Uh-huh. So I can further her about it. She's like, oh, I was going to tell you one day, you know, this night. And I'm like, well, I mean, I've stacked your toy rings. Right? Right? Is it? Yes, it is. Fifteen? Yeah. I told you not to call you back when you were eighteen. Yeah. What's up with that thing? Either way, maybe she can go to work for the police and date county. And by the way, I'm so glad this guy mentioned that. So that's, well, he didn't really do it directly. But he inspired me to bring that back to mind about the sixteen year old hooker down there. Have you noticed all the talk about the penny sales tax and all the obfuscation and all the other bullcraft that nobody wanted? Has anybody noticed what I predicted? Many, many weeks ago, it's got to be two or three months now easy. That that story has just vanished. It's a beer. Long gone. With those cops that were running the prostitution ring down there in Kindle and elsewhere, I think in Hailea with underage hookers. And allegedly there were cops from every police force and date county involved in it. The cop cars were showing up morning noon and night. And the meantime, what do we got? We got out of sunshine waving his ham hocks there on channel four, screaming about air conditioning companies that he won't name on a year. Nice exposat yesterday on channel four by the way, not you coward you spymeless big fat turd. What a piece of crap that was. Yeah, well, they originally weren't Boko another in a summer. But did they mention it on the year? No, so what kind of service you're providing for the public? In the meantime, where's the exposat? Oh, I got a Hallopanio pinger caught my pepper in my throat. So like that. No seriously, where does the follow up on that story? Just vanish. Just disappeared. Just like I predicted as they swept out of the carpet. All the great investors journalists we got in this town. The investigators. Yeah. Like I see them. And all these other brilliant reporters we got in this town. Just kind of slipped through their fingers to follow up on that story. I mean, after all, she wasn't least 16 anyway. 21 before I won in five, 60 WQA. I'm, I guess, what next got? I don't know. Hey, listen, this one like a gag. Like that. Yeah, well. Here's the most delighted, not sticking down your throat. And the cigar, too. Come on. What's up with you, Gumpa, Miss Corjo?

You know, not that I want to sound selfish I mean, somebody's stocks are making me nervous You're not going to watch the AOL on about 80 something 8080, you're right Great I say another week is a time to jump head over heels in the AOL You're giving that that's the new Rogers Byeric in the nation Right, which is a hell of a lot better You can just picking it out of a hat that most of the clowns you put on here But anyway, my CNF transportation bought it at 42 Yesterday was 44 and 11 16 So I think I think it's getting close to time to sell Which one was this man? CNF transportation Can you look that out? Can you look that out? Let me get you a fresh quote here CNF CNF currently is off-courder at 44 and 716 So I'm going to drive home so fast you wouldn't believe it There it is Roger, just call the sale because I'm this year I sit here all day and now where were you on vacation? Well, I went up to Cape Cod Uh-huh For a week and then I was home, by you I'm not going to make any tasteless comments about Did you fly up or drive on? I was going to say I got out of there before the air traffic got heavy I think that's it Oh, oh, oh, oh And actually Let's congratulate CNBC for being the one network At least during the daytime hours That didn't get carried away for three solid weeks with that John John Craig Who was that up at the stock market stuff on it? We do have a mandate Oh, God And talk about a little bit of overkill If you've pardoned that expression It was bad It was bad It was nice to be off Yeah, so what do you think is happening? Every day the air was pointing down Right now, down 52 and a half on the Nasdaq Do you have us on in the studio? I just turned it on since you called I want to see all the bad news now Well, I mean 52 points is major There is, there is yet this up in Bauer County Worrying about this That's because it's about like 200 points on the down Well, I don't want to get nervous But the Nasdaq is going in the toilet It's well, you know, it's all the people Why not? I mean, stocks have just been become overpriced Or over-dialiates I don't even have no earnings But none of this makes any sense What doesn't that it's selling off of that they were That they were having this whole sell on Well, that didn't make any sense And neither does this because Alan Green's Banned had like two sentence in his speech That they didn't like And then because one of the stats there came out And we'd say later modified and said That it wasn't all that bad anyway Right away, everybody looks to me Like this market is looking for an excuse to say Exactly That was the point in the question lecture Right, that's right Right Yeah, but the point is, and I ask this I have every guest I have, you know? So if Green's Banned pulls the trigger for another quarter point So what?
