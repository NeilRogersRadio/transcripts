the grapple you know you would deserve when the women rushed to lead you try to hold the bat but she busted it relieved the sky was sad so sad it was pretty true but I had to go go drop the kids off and boom my aint it my aint it my aint it my aint it my aint it oh wow that okay five six you're gonna have to be Monday dear lots of surprises today boys we're gonna grow surprise I guess they're one of the springers on the sun they've expanded the show 10 a.m. the three p.m. where I know I'm assuming that there's extra compensation while the net when you were some something I'm looking at the schedule and of course Bluff don't make no mistakes okay 10 the three today it's three to six hang Goldberg from Shulas 6 to 930 it's mad dog Jimman it's a rye because the books is on the west coast of the team remember that team that song keeps going through my mind over and over all the marlins do we really have such a song oh yeah we do yeah I don't know why anybody one of my spots on the marlins games no real cheap no way to you find out how much they're trying to pet a low spot by the way 250 to 300 bucks for spot on the marlins if they got any takers yet so they've expanded the show from 10 to three because the two to three hour they want to they want to get the whole day part that's the way arbitron breaks the day parts down 6 to 10 10 to 3 3 to 7 7 midnight so I'm assuming that they you know they don't like to drop off there in the two to three hour so they want us to be on from the whole five hours how do you like that 10 to 3 the other a piece of shocking news one of our sales people has left which is um maybe your shockdara we wish you're the best she's gone we'll see her no more why do you think she left by the way so anyway yeah oh what is what is he rushing in here now with the now with the new and revised schedule I guess they heard about the extra compensation for the extra hour and they changed their mind they thought guys I would have a nice thing to just suck him into doing the two to the three the new schedule says 10 to two oh thank you that's okay I don't want to highlight your mistakes but you know at least it's evidence you're doing something that's good he's making those schedules up frankly we got a brand new one here with a just a matter of moments nice that's by the way bluff nice desk is he got that new desk yet oh okay it's only April what is April 19th and by the way George one in case you missed a show Friday that was the office pool will George get his 200 out now you haven't got it yet have you I don't hear what you're saying I'm either the vionic sorry people keep taking my mic out of program oh you're using this room at four hours but you have it a while they do that I thought we have a lot kind of we do but we share this room why with people because it's the other control room like when we run the games on two separate radio stations etc so on this is the control room well there are no more Panther games or whatever are we going to be carrying the Panther playoff games so I have got the money yet physically but it should but it is in there he's already got the words going to be in there and block on his new desk oh no no son but it's only April 19th so what do we have in the yesterday sun sent on the course there are certain things I have a strategy that I used to read the Sunday papers because then we have an a herald especially there is no newspaper there are just advertising sections there are classifieds there are auto ads there are like 20 pounds at least I'm not to get a good size tournea from the hero on the Sunday paper there's no reading material in there you just I just keep siphoning through section after section after section where is the editorial page one the opinion review point what of the used to call where is that one where is something where is the sports section where is anything that you could read and by the time you get done 90% of your Sunday paper especially the hero is crappy throw the dumpster immediately so anyway Tom jica always read the sunset will not the TV book itself but Tom's questions and answers because I know that Tom makes him up he's been doing that for years thanks again Tom keeps following it right always gets my name in there somehow one thing I love about Tom but other than that is you always gets my name in there somehow and this is great because it ties in with a lot of stuff we were talking about last week about that morning show all in by the way speaking of the morning show is the default on vacation or something this week I never thought I would miss him so badly they never said a word about where is he oh don't don't don't don't I gotta make other one of those corny stories about being in gambling rehab or something like that because I turned on my radio on the car this morning I heard BEEE all day in the little dog who was like just sitting there until he started getting carried away and over modulating there at the end of the show and talking about this like real the mic was too hot and was popping his piece and getting all that other shape and how come neither one of them by the way had the guts from the part that I heard to call Jimmy the gangster coach not that I want to talk about that draft garbage the gangster coach at the event with the hercalant who was the gangster coach in Dallas he was the gangster coach so why should come is any surprise that he stole the gangster coach seescle Collins give me a break please okay Jimmy never met a gangster he didn't like and like Wayne says if you win games nobody will care we just have to win a lot of games we don't care if we let everybody off death row and raford if they can win us a few games we'll borrow him okay anyway getting back to Tom jica after the break how how did that just happen I haven't even said hello yet and it's already time for a god damn break must be because of those great young adult male demigratants we got right Tom that time jica man oh see if you're one of those people that hangs out of the track with Tom I mean he's always been very nice to me he still likes me even though he denied but uh I don't hang out with the track at the track with Tom he doesn't come into pop at all part he goes to those uh other horses you know the ones that there's a half hour in between races and you sit there and nothing's going on and he hangs up there in the pressbox with Hank and Eddie Kay and I guess with D4 too we can never thought about that till this morning am I right about there oh yeah you found a red dog you've chugged a red wolf now open your mouth and wrap your lips around our red cock red cock spully head will leave you breathless red cock goes down easy and it's never hard on your throat so reach into that box and wrap your fingers around a long neck red cock you can shake it and spray it all over remember you can't beat our red cock just look for the label with the big red pecker on the front okay 1015 at 5.52. you have a reason out there was a little pause there because I'm reaching back in a fashion machine for stuff that I'm not going to read on your anyway it's for you by the way George but you're not going to get it guess what's from it from your friend Monica Martinez you know Monica she just called she just called she just called to say what what's the fashion machine because it's packed to you the information about the holistic and interactive look at that interactive i.t.e.g.r.a.t. integrative oh maybe that's what it is holistic and integrative is there such a word as integrative there is now health conference with Dr. Rackens any measure needle could make it would be greatly appreciated no huh aren't you going to plug the uh no productive no Bob no what she also wanted to know if we wanted to have them on in the cast no no I don't I don't have guests I mean we do have we actually oh you know something how long is that little tiny baby chair been sitting there I was going to say we actually have a guest mic which we do and we I guess chair but I'm looking at the chair it's like a little tiny baby chair the chair standard folding chair folding chair yeah it's metal house could sit on it a little teeny oh yeah I could sit on it for about two and a half seconds until they both hit the ground well the one is here is even flaky here it's like pitch right in with dust desk can't us must macho dust desk or a little folding chair we don't have guests on a show that's going to be a cold day in hell and I start putting guests on a show although if we do have to do that two to three hour that might be a good hour to bring our guest on like maybe be no cooks and they're saying like that huh we could have like dino sister rally and dino cook we'd have bino and dino together how do I anybody had any bino today okay I'll get back to times you can a second Hollywood hello hello yes sir I think sometimes the best out of the local papers yeah um what happened you might get away the way you say that like there's a great selection the mine here so I don't why they have it something here old is 98% advertising yeah well that's why I get it for it you want you people that spend money advertising on a Sunday here you might as well flush it down the toilet because nobody reads it because it there's just too much of it in there everybody chose all those sections out but anyway this and you're getting extended to two to three yeah oh so you might you're going to do the next hour right are they going to pay you for the extra well we got to talk about that they just to pull this over on me you know they pull the fast one who's your agent huh who's your agent uh normal kids i'm going to how much percentage is it how much percentages you get no none none no he just does it because he likes me do you belong no do you want to he blow you know yeah there you go all right you have a good day when I say okay I'm blow this okay another jerk here's a North Miami hello yeah which is the yard or rain and on his break yesterday meaning what the game was important to Pittsburgh at the moment I mean the fact Buffalo one later made it less important but the planet everybody seemed to forget about in the middle of all the wings so was that the game had significance for Pittsburgh right far as their playoff seed was concerned nobody you want to pay any attention was kind of like Pittsburgh was supposed to roll over and let wings stick five or six in the net right if I could say nice gone everybody we love it I can't stand wing I mean it was a very emotional day and I saw all the crap and the CDC went totally crazy but you know good bonnet good enough with him already you're going to he went out at the right time anybody it says like Don Sherry all he made a mistake you don't go out like a clown he went out he had a decent season his skills are waning okay they're waning so y'all are the next up and coming away uh Neil me up and coming what super star he didn't up and coming already is a super star you don't have to explain that to you what would he mean up and coming well we'll use to decide rescue said again he is the superstar right now pop out brewery if he ever gets healthy again in place again was also a superstar but anyway here's a mobile in bokeh hello mobile yes sir hey how about those uh the new pro player pediatentiary in the home of a 1999 Miami car it's against the team man how come nobody seems to care about that this even Eddie the Pope and Eddie the Pope is a dope okay he has a story the third time in a 23 years I've lived in this town he's ever written a column that made any sense at all and even Eddie the Pope says shame on you Jimmy you against the coaches basically what is saying what a bunch of crap Jimmy just showed that he has no morals if he could go right the uh I mean I want to show that all you all you parents out there you better tell your kids I want to take them to the dolphin game or you sit around watching it on television we hope you kids grow up just just like all these gangsters that Jimmy is so enchanted with that's right you can go up some in the long line go back even when she was we had Bobby Humphrey's and we had the mark duper who became against their all at least he wasn't when he was playing I mean gangsters that's the heaven and bed of yet Jimmy never met against the heat in the like I think if he's going to the predatory he would he would care Neil have a good one have a great day here's the Cecil column which I don't want to get started because this it was bad enough all the pre draft garbage but now they're doing the post mortem on it which is just terminal not only that here me I'm a radio this morning but then the content of what they're talking about oh and this one draft it is you know Joe was right about that nice go on little dog even though he were distorting on the air because he was so whipped up about it who the hell knows and who the hell cares let him play a couple of games and find out who did the right thing but there was no question that's against the coach this town ought to be revolted and you know what about your assuckers we got in this town especially in the media so they're going to be oh well Jimmy must know something yeah he knows something he knows crap what he knows swanolouiziana state and mick niece state running back Cecil Collins whom the dolphin selected was the first pick of the NFL's fifth round draft yesterday recently pleaded guilty to two counts of this isn't even uh the batable it's not like Tony Martin which is still in limbo that's another maybe games to at least we know he can play number one and number two maybe he might get off but this guy recently pleaded guilty to two counts of unauthorized entry and two counts of simple assault these are the terms of his sentence okay five years of suspended jail time four years of probation required weekly drug testing required drug and behavioral counseling twenty five hundred dollars owed to a better women shelter in a in baton ruselliziana within a year no contact with the victims no access to the LSU campus okay he was kicked off the LSU team and isn't even allowed back on the campus okay Cecil the diesel a piece of turd another piece of turd and it's interesting by the way if you read the other article here dolphin teen security investigators stored winestein winestein oh compiled reports on three hundred forty eight players in this drag who had troubled paths was there anyone with a litany of trouble as long or serious as columns he was asked and the answer was oh so Jimmy picks the most troubled the most the biggest gangster the biggest piece of turd that money can buy that he can find and now he could just cross your fingers and hope for the best and like Wayne says I want all you kids out there to make sure you understand one thing okay Wayne doesn't give a crap about setting any example for you kids out there all he cares about is let's win some games so we can make Wayne look good and make him so our money if you win games nobody will care how many gangster you put on a team that's what he is alleged to have said paraphrased nice going Wayne you bolted scumbag just keep the gangster thing going man the gangster thing thank god I gave up my dolphin all the way still get him free from here but thank god I gave up paying for those dolphin tickets two or three years ago after five years of misery and suffering I must be on drugs that there's something you know and I just don't know yet I feel like I'm on drugs maybe it was reading Tom jick is calling yesterday they did it here's the letter that and let me tell you again Tom you make these up you're not fooling me I know you make these up sweetheart question what is with the first team on w2am radio a m560 according to neo rodgers there are 26 minutes of commercial every hour my theory is ratings are so low they have to sell spots for pennies making it necessary to sell so many steep goals Dean sounds like album the chipmunk on helium Jeff before it makes lame analogies and Joe Rose just tries to stir controversy it's a very bad show I listen to a lot of music in the morning says AA in plantation Tom is answer you have a thought of your own or do you merely purret everything the old says how are you such an expert on a program you say you don't listen to the fact is oh this gets to be the really good stuff okay get the life and gas ready the fact is the first team has such a commercial overload one thing about what you I and Neil agree because sponsors are clamoring to reach it's huge young adult male audience at a premium rate it's huge young adult male you would assume these guys it got big numbers there in the morning no the hand big numbers like in a young male no as for your assessment of host at least they know something about the things they criticize I thought that the analyzation there was the best I've ever heard about guilty it's just deep goals Dean sounds like album the chipmunk on helium yes does anybody question that is that a debatable point no he he he so I thought my radio was but to for sure this might please the far wherever you are come back is he out sick is the on vacation what's the story the biggest is the story he's in Vegas turning Jeff de Flores Loosen Vegas will be in no seriously that would be like letting Cecil Collins Loosen dormitories at the u.m. I mean what what is that Jesus Christ Almighty we may never see him again if Louis the lip finds out how much deep was into the because he knows out there we met over seeing every day maybe on your radio in the morning and you know I come into work on a mask and my key why do I do this to myself I keep asking myself can't the people that run this place can't they hear that what that's not you know what what that sounds like don't they get it and the obvious answer is no they don't so anyway Tom jick a great the great letter that you made up their time it's a beautiful thing and I've got the ratings back out from the last trend that young audience you're talking about I'm looking at 18 to 34 they're not on the first page they're not on the second page they're like on the third page number 14 in the morning with a 1.9 18 to 34 we're doing a little bit better than with a 5 to about a 6 between 10 and 2 number 7 here in midday not that we don't have enough spots we got spots of the old uh back to also but not as many as they got not 26 minutes an hour seriously stop and think about this how long would you say those updates to sports updates last about three minutes each so three then four an hour three an hour okay three times four is 12 plus 26 is 38 minutes that leaves 22 minutes out of the hour 38 minutes of non-programmed content and 22 minutes of like that you don't count the rejoins and the rejoins like I said four minutes of actual program content per hour what do you expect them a guy that can't even get the schedule right okay this guy's going to program a morning show are you kidding me no 10 26 at 5 60 WQM don't miss the biggest on all 33 at 5 60 against the team maybe that's what we got we got against the teams here on QA I'm a bad team we got against the teams and we got just lame ass teams like the Panthers season is done by the way was either shared in it for that game no I was not there in fact we probably get a spy reporter too but all the good stuff the giveaway that's why they filled that place that over 19,000 allegedly and that's why they allegedly filled it up because they they were given stuff away was fan appreciation I pre-sticks and free crap and of course Christine and more last broadcast I was in the car go to the store I heard the last few or four minutes of the game and then between guilty and Randy Mower I am going to tell you the my my radio almost inverted I've been having a lot of radio problems in that car I thought the radio was going to get sucked right through the dashboard what a suck up job that I mean it's one thing to be humble and nice and you know it was great working with the you never stole a freight train and thanks for all your help but I mean just the suction was just unbeatable there Christine and more won't hear that no more thank god so anyway Tom jica I hate to break the news to you but the fact is that all those spots that are in there in the morning show a lot of those spots are in there because well you know we got the marlins and we got the dolphins we give away all these freebies and all those all these other things all these things so we've got 80 million spots we got a one which you know should we be proud of that? No of course not in fact as weak as that show is I think the guys deserve credit if for nothing else the fact that you have any numbers when there's basically no show it's all spots radio no show WQA in all spots radio hello say how do you like that I love that I I get goosebumps I really do I feel like going home and shaving my crotch when I when that happens now seriously because you cut you catch him with their phone down when you when I pick him up call him another expecting it here's a mobile in Jupiter hello hey the idea is great hey you obviously didn't listen to the rimma telecasted you I didn't see or we'll listen or other than a three minutes in the car I want to game was ending no I didn't pay anything well what I pay and I did not gain I know you didn't but I had that and by the way for those people were saying it wasn't all that bad the panthers were their 78 points they won all five games against Tampa Bay the worst team in the league otherwise it would have 68 points okay winning 10 points against Tampa Bay shouldn't even count the standards but anyway go ahead yeah maybe half a point anyway you got to replace your Ray Wittney has a pair he's when he scored his second goal remember says in Ray Wittney's got a big pair yeah like that so you've got to replace that I bet you could keep doing that up though okay remember how the showers next season they want to back in there we're going to start wondering you got to get that on your uh and cut that up and play that okay it's pretty good I don't know that until I got today Ian Wiley you're a big douchebag okay sir thank you there you go there's the voice of the Panther fans that's their analization which I got a lot to say about that by the way Michael Russo all I can say about Michael Russo is he's an asshole wow woo now one of the people in this town are catching out of that game at all so wonder here's a guy who covers the you know the primary hockey guy for the Sun sent a lot your long and in yesterday's paper grading the Panthers of demise and men or that Denise Denise and men and he grades everybody on the team including you know the equipment guys everybody whoever was in the arena the uh sure's this is this is so anxious man I don't I don't even know what words to start to begin where to start with this idiotic bunch of crap although if you turn to the previous page or so somewhere in here somewhere in the middle of the at least they got some crap in here okay here's a big Michael Mayo thing suddenly discovered who went gritsky was nice go on Mike he's up there in the York cover in that like he knows what it's all about which he does not they took an internet survey who or what is most to blame for the Panthers not making the playoffs this season 800 votes or 57.8% said Terry Murray oh pm 450 votes or 32.5% bm fly and Murray inexperienced only 4.5% under achieving veterans 4.5% popbell breweries injury only 0.8% so what other words let's see 90 90.3% of the uh well so like a 15 or people responded over 90% of them said it was the Murray's how do you like that I love it even a people on here that don't know that much about the game it doesn't take a rocket sign just to figure out that the Murray boys are where the real problem is that's the sugar in the wood pile is tm and bm but wait till I get well when you get if you haven't seen this yet or even if you have when you hear this crap at Michael Russo the ratings and guess by the way who gets a b b as in big black guy gets a b just just makes my blood boil also which both begin with a b who's with a b makes my blood boil makes it curdle and I think it all ties in together I was just saying uh during the break I was talking about the fact that white fans what no matter what it is whether it's my Tyson whether it's a football player even if he's against it or whether it's a Peter well who in the gangster but he's just a big black guy who serves very little purpose out there they love that is our big black guy and he's going to beat the crap out of somebody and we like that and you people want to admit that but it's the truth he's our boy huh and it's just like the big black guy named Ben it's the same mentality nobody's going to miss with your car if you have a big black guy named bro or Ben standing outside guarding it all day I could have come anywhere near that mother or the car either holy Macaron this is Joe Ball on the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey authority Neo God for a young beautiful girl who's at least in eight out of ten and has a mouth the same score for IQ Bill Clinton has a place for you it's the school for under-privileged kids building immediate learning suck bill for short at suck bill your little girls will be educated in all the fine arts that will make them a success in today's Clinton world Bill enjoys such guest teachers as tentanity this semester will be broken up into webbed to pots we'll be doing giggling and jiggling

to go down all the way to the top I'm sorry little girl what did you say I said how am I doing with your Kennedy I yep did think you're getting the point to quite well suck bill or someone else will call today 1044 at 550 WCM Michael Russo who's you know just another another putwacker other piece of crap maybe him at low-pudbury jackass dude's all a favor he rates uh first starting with a coach Terry Murray okay rates a mustee a c in other words like a passing grade like he did something okay taking over a team that like discipline he held players accountable for four play by scratching or venturing them did this help no no did not pop out brewery he goes on to rate an a okay now that's face if we all know anybody with a brain even the panther fans most of them don't know anything about the game everybody knows he's a superstar a he gives them why even rate him he played a handful of games and then he says a great case could be made for MVP because the team collapsed upon word that he would be out six months within the injury is there any doubt he would have scored 50 goals of a played a full season but that's not the point the point is he played a handful of games how can you be the MVP on the team when you play the handful of games and you rock for the rest of the season jackass then we get to rob neither market to see minus that's the close d would have been more appropriate c minus robber's fail a d there you go but now here we come to this here's the thing and again this is a major market newspaper by somebody who's supposed to know what he's writing about mark parish great worky big year little rookie school scoring 24 goals he gets a b Sean Burke who far out played our Wallace expectations in goal especially with a crappy defense in front of most of the year he gets a b Ray Whitney who again led the league as led the team in goals points win a game winning goals he gets a b a b i'm not I wouldn't waste your time reading the comments as innocuous and an a n is they are okay keep that in mind mark parish Sean Burke Raywood they'll get a b who else gets a b Peter Warrell gets a b as in bullcrap he says with Paul laws fighting less warrell has emerged as the teams in forcer but he's much more physical in laws which is a bit of positive because he's always looking for the big hit and creating space for his teammates is all around game is much improved he gets a b in other words he's on a par with Ray Whitney Sean Burke and mark parish okay I'm not even gonna I'm not even gonna waste my time reading the rest of this crap okay because I'm so furious with Michael Lucio what kind of a horse ball sound is this guy isn't qualified to be writing in the weekly reader okay much less than a major market freaking newspaper the whole season goes by 82 games again I'm the only person on the whole arena that sees you can't see the goal like goes on split a goal of score they managed to complete the entire first year in the arena with that and here's a big black guy out there that the crowd is just upset with because he's our big black guy and keeps whackin and spearing and flashing guys on the other team and getting a lot of stupid penalties uh the accomplishing mostly nothing and this guy get he puts him on the same par with the teams leading goal score and the goalie that played a pretty damn good season for us and the best rookie in a god damn league for my money and you wonder why the people here don't that they don't learn anything why nothing that changes like running in place here there's no progress baby there ain't no progress because we've got put whackers like Barry jackass and Michael Russo and I'm gonna say something David J. Neale at sports at the right for the hero his hockey column is 10 times better than Michael Russo we don't like his outfit that he wears at the games too well but nevertheless at least he has some idea what he's writing about which is more than you do Michael Russo you big jackass you you put you piece of turd you here's a mobile and hollywood hello mobile and hollywood nine minutes 35 seconds they waited I'll watch on our dime that's right five six seven five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's a mobile in Miami hello yes sir I am you yes what are you gonna do not say the

speaking of knowing where I am all of not just here it's the american fnway maybe it maybe it's not human nature it's an american thing the rubber necking thing I know it's bad enough that we have rubber neckers out there in a highway every kind of you like a fender bender or even a cop is pulled over the side of the road even if you're sitting there playing with himself everybody slams on a break they got a slow down I got to take a look now we have assholes we have the idiot stick a lot to wait and for a plane crash you know who should out there at the two airports it for waterdale and

bring up the Everglades now we have fire rubber neckers some of them of course they showed on his technical channel seven news this morning and the one guy said oh you know there's just so much hype about it I just had to see it talk about a guy with no life with no brain of his own there's so much hype that he just had to go out there and see it you know how about just put in a little piece of paper in the ash tray and setting it lighting a match okay there you go it's fire you ever see fire before that's what it looks like and then they got some dumb bitch on there and she's going out about oh it's just amazing to me that's something as as dangerous and as threatening it is horrendous is this can be so beautiful and I'm thinking of myself get her name okay you better take her thumbprint right now get her thumb on it seriously because if ever there was an arsonist of making it somebody that talks about how exciting it is in beautiful it is to watch fire don't let her in your neighborhood I'll tell you that assholes who want to go out there and it's closest they can get to the blades to watch the fire I mean just you think that there's a message in there maybe they have something in common with the draught next from this last weekend I have no right yeah that's what the what do they have a big sign on their forehead that says I have no life a tattoo coral spring fellow morning meal that is okay uh meal these people with were well I wish they would just get off of it already not only is this guy not an NHL player he's not a minor league not a hockey player no these people I think the only thing they know about hockey was they got it there when they got their season subscription they got a copy of the movie slap shot and that's what they think hockey is about yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah wow it just pisses me off I read those articles on my Twitter but anybody that's been even a few games that gives this guy if you're going to grade the performance give them the same grade as you give a re-witney and a Sean Brook and a Mark parish this guy uh has to he's got rocks in his head no and this guy thick said always a great goon he's a great he can't skate uh give it he can fight if he was a good goon you know he'd be like good back like a beef shoulder at least somebody can put 20 goals in the put him in the net for you a year yeah if it's not even worth while talking about anymore until they get rid of him and the Murray's okay pal thanks me hold your breath okay see and it's the fact that the crowd responded that way see these people by anything and that's why that's why the Murray's especially be and that's why he's like to this long any crap that he pedals out there to the public oh yeah whatever you say man we think you're the problems but whatever you say we like it where's the free stuff five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line we got two three other lines over here this morning as usual here's a mobile and cutlery chill out hello no are you okay sir um i wanted to tell you about the the fact that i you know what i wake up in the morning sometimes i get in the car and i do listen to the first team but you're right about the uh the spots i mean and you know i hear more spots on there than i think up but what really takes me off is in the afternoon drive what i am coming home i try to listen to hang yeah you know i like hang can i love his uh his you know his way of doing the show and everything but i've counted the minutes i was timing it you're looking at nine minutes box every you know every minute of course right i have a minute or so yeah and out by the time it's all right i would have a handker we did a little cross over there on Friday and thanks to the lot got a run now i got a nine minute break coming up whoever heard on an AM radio station of a nine minute commercial break whoever heard a such a thought i'm telling you now i would listen to that show all the time if it was more like yours in the sense of where where we could hear more for about your inventory and the only reason my show is like this is because i you know i demanded that when i was assigned my contract even though they were supposed to be 14 minutes an hour and they boosted up to 16 because we got a sales manager who makes it up as you goes along but nevertheless so you know at least we got a limit on here and we they can't call beyond it if they could run 26 minutes of spots an hour and it's your we'd be settled with the same cramp well it's called it it's called an unlawless in the bull format and the program director sits in there with his finger in his ear a gee i don't get it we just don't seem to be me going anywhere you know it's all we're always flat we don't seem to be going anywhere they come but i you know that i hear the spots i i have to admit i'm sorry but i tune out as far as the uh the hands show because it's too long and then you have the you know they come back with their sports up later whatever and my time it's all over i think i need to go for like 10 minutes an hour right and i'm sitting there and you know something is not good for his health either because look you know he's always doing a show at choolers or some outside place where there's food around look at all the extra eating time it gives him while you know he's not talking absolutely i mean i'm not doing what i want to listen i just can't uh put up with that kind of format and yes you know that's one listener right here that tuned out every every you know so it's hard time jica will probably tell you just in that to agree with me but i think the audience does agree that's a format and the drive times and the station makes it almost unlicinable and can you imagine trying to call him to that show that's why he doesn't get that many calls because nobody wants to hold on for 3540 minutes just to get on with that anyway thank you very much no and have a great day bye you just need a lot of calls i can't get more calls no rest of us put together of course they're all from uh direct line from g a one was a lot of cameras out there is a lot of chronic cameras who can't stay up at night that late to wait till it comes on five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line it's the gang's the teams maybe i would force you turning into gang's the but he's the we didn't like a big black gang's a big black gang's here we like him here's a mobile and hollywood hello yes sir um that's she regulates tv and radio is that a statement or a question i'm asking your question yes because i watched scared strength and they were asking they said like 20 effort in the two hours conversation they could ask words right he word out of the because it's a documentary so in other words they make exceptions whenever it's convenient for them they make an exception it's a change to talk about your show so a documentary okay thank you sir and if you too okay well i for everybody okay because it's not the new Rogers documentary show so if you guys now they always do that if it's on public television then all of a sudden they can say whatever they want just like national geographic which a lot of guys used to watch that just to see those African naked women you know naked breast are okay if it's a national geographic documentary if it's on public television why do you think they call it public television but if it's on a network show then we're gonna thank your license or we're gonna yank something 560 560 pong 560 on the mobile online you want you mark my words there be nobody is saying about what i said about that micro russo thing or about any of that we don't have any panther fans any hockey fans in this town what

he's a big a suck hole at every step on the face of the zirith well that's all they do is suck up so they can get good quotes from him and they can get interviews from the coaches that's all they do around what i want to joke anybody that is not a decent order that man and these reporters have any balls whatsoever yeah you know that's why they're back when they talk about that that's why they

business never trust the bitch named monica here's a lady in Miami hello lady in Miami hello yes man are you doing okay i have a comment for you i were before to have a troll and i was much to know that we're not on the side of the road plan ourselves we are before she will all meaning what what is that why you have comments off for hard to control about how it is to the side of the planet itself that they shouldn't be giving you a ticket i should have done all that all you people do is right tickets that's right traffic tickets speeding tickets mostly okay and you don't think we should be out the right and tickets not unless somebody's driving dangerous way i don't think that's uh that i don't want to spend my testimony for that well obviously people are driving dangerously we're having bad actions on the road and people are getting killed all the time and in one of the ways in other words you only people are driving dangerously other people are going too fast is that was your telling no driving too fast aren't careless or i mean idiot how about the ones that are driving too slow how many tickets do you give every year for those oh quite a bit they cause action to the same as the people driving fast never heard of anybody that got a ticket or driving too slow ever in my life well i guess they're on call jettlement they got the ticket well let's let's see if we get any calls okay okay well keep up or keep up whatever you're doing okay the fhp slow to highway pigs all they do is right tickets that's all they do you need some assistance now they can't be bothered with that they don't remember years ago when we had uh problems on i and any five remember that many years ago when we had some scumbags that were like throwing bricks and cars and doing crap they called in the fhp and said hey that's what for a few days here let's have you do something useful like real police work and it said okay but uh you know the little dangerous she's very defensive and you know i mean that's what they tell you do i'm not blaming you personally sweetheart unless you want to take it that way that's okay with me but that's what you guys do you're right tickets it just like the people whatever the speed traps the same old crap like the decoy prostitutes this is police work in america to waste a time you know did you see the thing on sixty minutes last night by the way with my qualist that piece about the DNA no you didn't see that that was a good piece and of course the AC at you with sometimes i agree sometimes i disagree sometimes they're just obnoxious and in this case obnoxious would be a compliment i say that everybody should have their DNA taken at birth what's wrong with that and then one thing they didn't bring up in the segment which i can't imagine why oh it's so intrusive i'll have a ticket in your fingerprints that's intrusive urine test right how about how about having a pina bottle that's pretty goddamn it you know i mean if they want to take a stool sample i get a little bit personal especially depending on how they want to take it you know but taking your DNA and i had these women who were raped victims did they point it out that they want the one uh scumbag he was in jail i think he was gonna write the sound with the dolphin he was in jail and they didn't even know that he was in jail for something else and he was the rapist and once they were able to take the DNA and get the evidence they uh they nailed his ass but of course in the meantime he had gone out and raped 15 other women in the interim or whatever it was i mean when you went and then they had two god this is the best part they had one guy who had been convicted of murder he was out of jail already and one of the guy who attempted murder and these guys were sitting there very indignally it was an invasion of their rights well i hate to break the news here but even if you do the time you're still the slime okay if you do the car serious crime like that what kind of rights to these people expect to have left and they're very indignant that they don't want to DNA take okay because maybe it would show what real scumbags they really are you know maybe it would be yeah that was a good piece i'm sorry you didn't see that there was uh almost worthwhile watching and by the way you know i don't want to go in with i saw a little bit of 20 20 last night why is she on the air seriously so why is that woman on the air can anybody explain to me does she have naked pictures of the president of ABC there she had the inside information about that uh that Nazi fest they

think it's back to give the kids those dumb names, with all the names that tell five days, it's 1303, it's 560WQM, speak of the sub thing fancy, by the way, I'm actually reading, here's the worst part for your good friend Monica Martinez, well, you know, her name is Martinez, so George Lester, but anyway, here's the tip off, I'm reading this press release about Dr. Racken, who he's appearing with at this seminar, this integrative health conference, Dr. Julian Whitaker, MD, okay. Now the less I say about Dr. Julian Whitaker, I'm not gonna say anything about him, okay? I'm not gonna say anything about him, because that would be vague, you know, and he'll get upset about it. He's also a keynote speaker with the conference, he's written five books in the period on numerous national television, radio shows promoting nutritional medicine, he's the member of the American Medical Association, founder and president of the American Provenator Medical Association, he's also the publisher of the monthly newsletter, health and healing, believe me, you don't want that, you don't want it, okay? Because I got sucked into subscribing to that some time ago, and it's another one of these deals, where I'll just give us some money, and every month we'll send you another mindless piece of idiotic crap. I also bought his book on diabetes before I got to Dr. Bernstein, book to Goodman, and basically he says, nothing. Oh my god, Dr. Julian Riddaker, are you all? Jesus, good, God Almighty. Oh, thanks God, I didn't even promote that thing. Thank God, I had that sense, you know? Every now and then my sense is, 560, 560, 560, 560 on the 18T wireless line. Next thing that'll be put in public is the name and I was press releases do. That should chase them away. Here's four lotterdale, hello. Yeah, Neil. Yes, sir. One of the day the city link crap has that thing, a best Italian put lotterdale restaurant. Yeah. The best Italian I think is, I know, is that one on E4, Anthony's one where E4, that's the good. Also, another way to stick it to the city is, you know, toobles, but you can throw, you can throw pennies in the exact case thing, and they think will count it up another way to take it to a main enclosing. 560, 560, 560, pound 560 on the 18T wireless line. Oh speaking of a tany restaurant, I know I get some even I can squeeze something that out of that call. I know it's hard to believe. Ultimate Italian, or something, it's ultimate something. We're Boston Market used to be out there by me on Sunday, Maris Boulevard. It's, I don't know if it's open. I think it's even open. I don't know if this sign is lit up. I go by their last night going to my public. By the way, my public said the song, grass, they're the best. Oh, no, those people are great in there. I feel like a major celebrity and they treat me great. They're wonderful. But, ultimate Italian, to some kind of an Italian, I don't know. I don't know what it is. Maybe somebody will call looking for a free plug and tell us what that place is out there on Sunday's Boulevard. Ultimate, on the Boston, on the most something. The ultimate stuff. Right there, too bad I can't eat my pasta anymore. What are we gonna have for lunch today? Are you actually burning incense? Yes. Stinks. See, I don't give a crap what it is. I couldn't smell your farts in here. Thank God. But then I don't even know. What? I was holding a minute and now I can let go. Now, we're gonna find the marijuana incense. So we can start burning in here one day. It'll start walking through the vents all over the building and they'll be running around going. Oh my God. They're really smoking. I'll bring that in tomorrow. I'll roll it up in the paper. No, no, I'm serious. You're alive. There must be marijuana. I'll have to bring some back from Amsterdam one of these days. It'll smell just like it. Yeah, just like your 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Also, we got what's in the legal seafood, which I do believe opens tonight. They were depending on which part of the story you believed was right in the paper the other day. In the sagrass legal seafood from Boston Great Great Place. Of course, they sure if you live long enough out there in West Broward, if they ever put the fires out, things are gonna be great. Oh! Let's go out and watch some fires. Let's watch some grass burn, huh? Let's watch some brush fires. Here's Kendall, hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay, sir. Listen, let me bring out some apparent inconsistencies inconsistencies in your reasoning. Maybe you can clarify anything of what? What is that? Let me tell you, and then you clarify that, I don't want to argue with you, but you say people who've jumped on the panters banwagon three or four years ago when they were banwagon jumpers, and so forth. And I agree with you there. But as far as the mart is you rip them for a following a sorry team like we have, but if they banwagon later, then they're banwagon jumps. But it's not that difficult to have a sorry team. Anybody can have a sorry team, but the fact is they were World Championship team, and the owner went out and got rid of this dismantled the whole team to try to hold the community up for a stadium, everybody know anybody with a small brain knows that. I agree with you, but I follow the martens, I enjoy them. And you enjoy them, did you enjoy the seven times? I re-game with a seven to two game yesterday. Rich gained this weekend, did you enjoy the most? So what are you trying to say that nobody should follow the martens? They shouldn't. You can do whatever you want to do. I don't care. Okay, yeah, but you're saying that three? Should they follow the martens or not? They're not letting. What more didn't you understand? You want to follow the martens? If you have nothing else going on in your life and you want to get involved with a Florida Marlins with a class A baseball team, be my guest here. They're three and nine, just like the Orioles, they're three and nine. But they're not three and nine because they were a bad team. They were made into a bad team by a greedy, miserable SOB owner. And now you can say, well, you know, John, Henry owns them now, big deal. But haven't at least here, there must be in the big, advanced majority. Not that that makes me right, you understand. But it must be in the majority for once or this one because nobody cares about the martens. They're not drawing flies. And John, Henry's going to lose a lot more than 10 than in this year. He's going to lose his big. That goes what he's going to lose. But if you, you know, it's a free country. If that cranks your chain, if you enjoy following that, if you enjoy being a massacist and having somebody slap you in the face and sell away the whole team, fine, be my guest. Thank God, he didn't want argue about it. Nothing worse than arguing with people about stuff, you know? 560, 50560, Pont560 on the AT&T, where I'll sign up. We heard from anybody yet. They ever got a ticket for going too slow. No. That FHP bitch that called before. Anybody out there like the FHP? No. 21 till that smells like crap, man. It smells like, and do we get lunch here straight now? Yet or what? What lunch? My omelet. The bacon and cheese omelet. I'm still waiting for from last week. Where the hell are we going to get that? I don't know. You said the diner. So we have, let's still cost those. And he's not doing anything. So we have anybody around that'll go run. It's right across the street. I'll even buy them lunch. I'm paying for it. How the hell can you turn that down? I'm buying for once in my life. In fact, just tell them, start a tad. Tell them, remember, I'll pay for it someday. That's a good looking guy. He's the RECK-I-O-N. It's a record time. I've got to take off my shoes. Driff off my dress. It makes me wet when I see you, yeah. I'm making a record time. That's too big for my mouth. My body's hurting every end on top of you. And take it off my lubricated hook to you. Reck them. Give me an impact. Okay. Hey, I'll take it off the wall. The RECK-I-O-N. Oh. I want to drink or go. I want to laugh and call the audience. You better do the dirty. And that'll give it a go. You're the morning agent. And take it off the street. And drink some milk. Take up the gas. I want to fry fire to the ground. You're closing soon. And they do wonder where they're going to come with food. That's something, right? And it's on circumstances. I want to drink or go. Okay. Let's see if we have a little bit of a problem. You need to make sure that you're not ready to get complicated. Is it okay, George? No. Have a little bit of problem. Oh. I mean, I'm paying for it. I'm buying for watching my life. I'm paying for my own lunch. And he still seems to be having a little bit of a difficulty on there. Like bacon, but then what that is, like from a pig, from a kosher pig. And make sure it's from a kosher pig, by the way. Tom, it's a fat old Jew that's eaten it. 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T wireless line. Speaking of fat old Jew, Hank Goldberg will be here from Shulers Take Do It To A Clock. We got Jim Manich who's a real guy. He'll be here 690 and then the Marlon. This guy that called before, he wants to follow the Marlon. Thank God for him. There is one.

If you honestly comes in on roebley down the morning because he wants to do a move as fast as he can. Not that he wants to take any evasive action in this place. But there are some people chasing him around the hallways. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, palm 5, 60 on the 18. If he just changed your hair color, I'm telling you. Peacocks of a feather. Can you believe that?

It doesn't smell like wheat. I can't lose for it. I don't want to smell anything. I'm smelling that horrible incense that you're burning in here. And it smells like pure on a duller way. Yeah. I'll call that stuff. It's out already. But it's still, and then it's going to make it. It's going to linger on. The flexing well, the fart is already out of my rectum. But you know, the aroma is not. No, I'm not. I doubt it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. I'll take your word forward. 5, 5, 60 on the 18. Why does lie? Fort Lauderdale. Yes, sir. I want your opinion.

We're going to be auctioning it off real cheap tomorrow. By the way, between 10 and 2. Good stuff. Not this stuff from around here.

How do you like that? Or you know the more they stall. Or is that what it was? The stall routine. That's what it does. Okay. Deal. Neil. The more they say, Neil, that's what gets it on the ear. Here's North Miami. Hello. North Miami. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. You know, what, what the, and then should do with all sports and your polish sports. Yeah. Okay. That's it, Neil. This man, this man waited 19 minutes and 36 seconds to say that. To say this. Well, I, yes, give it a, I share knowledge all sports. No, sir. I think what they had to do is abolish people like you is what they had to, they ought to make it illegal to be like you. Whatever you are, that's what they ought to make it illegal to be like. The amount of money that would waste 19 minutes and 36 seconds of your marginal resistance to tell me something so idiotic and ridiculous and good point by the way, sir. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. The gangster fish. That's what we got here. Maybe the dolphins are against the fish. Because Jimmy never met against the he didn't like. You're at a scrazed Jimmy. You're at a scrazed and embarrassment to those of us with a brain, which, of course, leaves most of the sports that are ads. And those who pander to them. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on the AT&T line. Looking for people who like the Florida Highway Patrol. Here's Miami. Hello. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. Yes, I was just watching Channel 6 and they were just showing the latest coverage of it. They're by the five people and now bringing out their goddamn kids. Putting them on their shoulder, their younger kids. Their kids just seeing their hacking and hauling. People are bringing out their long. They're filling their kids. Lung's up with all that crap. All that's, you know, it rained a little bit yesterday. I don't know about where you are. You are rain the for about a half an hour yesterday. Or when I was sad and saddened. And there was all this, soot on my patio. All this, soot that it washed off the roof. Now I'm several miles. I mean, I'm pretty far west, but I'm still several miles. Thank God for more of the fires are. And there's all this, soot in the air. I mean, if you walked out of your house on Saturday and most of South Florida, your lungs were filling with all this crap. And people are taking their kids as close as they can to the sky. But I'm blazing and fern a lot there so they can fill their lungs with this crap. They're bringing their goddamn lounge shares under beer coales and whatever the hell else they got in there. They're having a fire party, baby. These are the same jackasses that came down the South sig. Well, we were trying to dig out exactly. These are the same assholes. And I hope that fire jumps over and burns. Even though I don't wish someone to get. Well, no, go ahead. Go ahead and head. And either of these, maybe light is here. I've got damn crisp. Right. And we can have a roast and goddamn marshmallows on their bodies. No, okay. We'll turn the light thing over with the marshmallows. Okay. You're just coming down. People bring in their lawn chairs and their little kids. It's a sporting event now. Probably more exciting than most of the pants again, but nevertheless, it's fire watching. Let's go watch the fires burn up the Everglades. Let's go smell that smoke. Huh? Oh, we're talking about crazy people, baby. We're talking about certifiably crazy people. And the media is reporting on this like, hey, is this great? I bet to some of these people are actually sacrificing their time and their space. They probably have a sign in spots that they've, you know, gotten over the years at the airport. On a perimeter road, you know, you know, the ones I'm talking about. They sit out there waiting for a plane crash. And they would never admit that. You know, just like the people are like, auto racing like Joe Costello, they never admit they go to that stuff to see cars crash. Oh, no, everybody wants to go see. Oh, you know, round and round and they're waiting for the big crash. I mean, you know, it's kind of fascinating if you're sitting in a plane waiting to take off on the runway and another plane comes in like a big 747. It's kind of a true thing to watch it come in and land in you know. Huh? But I don't think I would drive out to the airport on perimeter road to sit there for several hours and pack a box lunch. And two or three, six packs of beer. You know what I'm saying? And watching all the plane. Oh, here comes another one. And here's another one. Yeah. And even crash yet. No. I'd dance. So those people are sacrificing their spaces that they've probably had those for years. But this doesn't come that often. You know, you can watch your plane come in like one right after the other anytime you want. So watching a fire burn in the Everglades, big massive fires like these. There's don't come along every day. Thank God. Who's that? I want to know what what about is with him. Okay. There's stuff self aggrandizing facts you. What does he want? Come on. Yeah. I can't go to the lower mic of my radio. Okay. You want? Yeah. Turn your radio off. There's no. He doesn't want me to talk about the porn. What are you talking about? Okay. He doesn't know he's on. Are you on the air? Oh, no. What's the hurry? I remember my on your way. I'm dumb as a callers. Now, what's wrong with you? You need to hear that. I know it's for what I'm, I went from 307 to 293. Each of you heard that fat. So you went from one? I went from 307 to 293. What did you just take your good? It's for rappers. Oh, what kind of a weight loss is that? I think I'm going to say I'm doing it. I'm doing that because a lot of protein. I'm afraid I'll have to take my insulin in my arm. I'm frightened. Oh, good. That's better. That's called the scare the crap body of that. That's your own way of doing it works. I'm frightened. I'm afraid it's scary for years. It doesn't do anything. It's not. I didn't care. I didn't even know it. It didn't matter. Yeah. But the show was wonderful. You know, you know, I was yelling at you with a microphone. I was yelling. It's okay for Judy Annie to shoot a black guy 41 times. Right. That's right. I don't want to get into my amazelle for grandising. Big fat you. One day will be skinnier than you. Who will lower it over you. Who will take you boy. If you keep smoking all that weed and Amsterdam, you're going to lose any weight. That's a problem. I will be there there 28. By the time you get there, by the way, we'll have all your drugs cleaned out of there. There won't be a thing left in the place. The VCR John's obsessed with your VCR. There won't be anything. It'll be nice and clean for you. I know. Listen to me. I tell you, I don't want to hear. I know my fat you. I just want to tell you you still. I know you hate compliments. You're the best radio guy in the world. And I love you. And I will perform for like you. You're right about the first part. Yeah. See you. Thank you. You want information on those. Point of thing. You have to work for me. I'm available. I want information on that apartment you were going to get me in. You know what? It's yours. How big is it? It's a big thing you're doing. Yeah. Yeah. How do you say it? Okay. It's a small bedroom. And a living room. And the point is, is that a view? It's bright. Yeah. And it's one block the marijuana and hemp museum. It's three blocks and grease alley. It's one door for the movie from the rural. It means from the rural. Yes. Right. I don't know how much is it. How much is it? Well, I pay it. I think you're 16. You're going to kill the romance. Yeah. But my landlord said he had a place for you. You never pulled the most cable. You think I should. Because why not moving there? Yes. So. And you're going to see what I got for you to know that was your, you know, your richer million two. You'll get a full $5,000 a month. Yeah. Because you're a rich too. And you're paying half of it.

Whatever this show is, we got to 2-4-5-6, 7-0-5-6, 5-6, 7-0-5-6, the Pomp 5-60 on the mobile one line. Seriously, I feel like I'm in speed today. Maybe it was turning on a radio this morning coming to work in Erie. Yeah! Let's sound, yeah? Oh, seriously, I'm trying to keep up with Yalde. Maybe it wouldn't suck that helium today. Or something. Here's my me, Lake. Hello? Hello, me, yo, man. How's it going, man? Great. A couple of weeks ago, I promised you a clip of Joe Bowling. Yeah, where is it? Oh, this, hang on a second. What line is this guy? Hang on man. What's he on? Is this you? Hello. Hello. What's going on here? What just happened there? Where was he? Six. Are you there? Hello? Yes sir. Okay. I'm going to go in line. We had that awful echo in there. It's like 50 seconds long, if you're in here right now. Am I going to be able to hear it? I should be. Okay. My son took a circle back to the link. Blue line. Left it for traffic jam. He turned to Johnson. I think it would go with the momentum in over line. Got the sound for a passing spot. It comes back to the blue line. Out of the fire side for Sullivan. Sullivan holding it in the signing of the shoot. And Kyle McParenita said that he has been a pillar of strength on that spot to defend. John, you don't want? I don't want to say. Oh, me. I want to say. I kind of just say. I'm just saying. He makes like you say. It's fine to go to the first area. Brart. Let's go with a standing. Go! Go! Go! I'm just going into the fire side. Go to the fire side. Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! How about Nolan Phuzie? What's in there, Joe? What? What is that? Greg Reed is in there with a sour look on his face. I don't want to see your ass. Okay. What is this man doing? He's taking his pants down. Thank you, sir. God bless you. I don't want to see your ass. What was that from? That's nothing. He's been showing his ass in this place for years. Is what they tell me. He's I told you he's got a cracked coxus. He didn't believe me either today. He cracked his coxus. Huh? And then he hired back down coxus for the weekends on power afterwards. Maniac. I've never worked. I've been in a business a hundred years. I have never in my life worked in a place before where the boss came in and took his pants down in the middle of my show. Am I right? Did he just take his pants down? Didn't business me. Who knew all the time? Jesus Christ. He's got a purple wreck. Wow. What can you say about that? Yeah. Yeah. That's what you can say about that. Jesus Christ. My end of the sky is sure as I'm sitting on my fat ass on his chair. Greg Regis walked on in here and buried his wreck. With a whole all of us to see. And it wasn't a pretty sight either. I'll tell you that. There are two pains of glass in between you and that. Yeah, that's right. You were up close and personal to see that purple wreck. Go and see what I've learned from that. Incentive. Yeah. Oh. Oh. I didn't know about that part. WCOM. Hey, all you doing. Great. Listen to me. The most hideous horrendous side that I saw at the game Saturday night. Yes. How come I'm not getting inspired. I wasn't going to get the game. What's going to be? Yes. Of course. The thing won Jeremy naked. Yeah. He's more on. Put up a big banner. He's a big crass. Good luck or miss you, my brother. Oh, God. You can do the car. I was like, you gotta be kidding. But if you could have heard the radio thing Randy Mower and Gellley suck in his butt those last four or five minutes. I mean, the whole last part of the broadcast that's you only part I heard I was in the car. And I'm going to tell you I had never heard such suction in my life was unbelievable. The strangles up I shoot in critical. They took him that Chris well. Then I see the thing at the bottom of my brother. I want to know my god it's for the more on the one. On the one hand, a spy report that after the game, I guess they brought him out for a ceremony to wish him well and thank him and yada yada. And they announced his name and it was like a sitting ovation with no nothing nothing happened. I also like to say that the sun settled right how the panthers close with a flurry. Come on. Yeah, they went three games in a row for the first time all year long. Right. When it means absolutely nothing. Especially against the Tampa Bay was they won 10 points of their 78 against the worst team in a league. I mean, what does it mean? What does that mean? This could be play a lot of that night also. It's three to one there. You know, it's three nothing. It's three one. A bloating penalty on Mr. Warren. Yeah, right about there. Yes, another stupid penalty. You know, real smart. Well, you're leaving out the big goal. He got eight. He's leaving out that big goal and the totally meaningless game. These people are obsessed with that guy. I have no idea what it is. He must have naked pictures of about 80% of the people. They're talking at a rear. They could picture of. And he must have a naked picture of Michael Russo who gives him a beat who puts him on the same love. See, I can understand. Palm Elburi. If you're sitting a standard. Palm Elburi is the only superstar. You give him an eight. If that's what Michael Russo means. But then the level below that. Okay, Whitney and Sean Burke and then my mark Perry. That's fine. That's the level below the superstar. But to put Peter Warwell on that level with those guys is enough to make me vomit. You skate better than him. Exactly. That's embarrassing. God bless that. I'm out of it there. Okay. My brother. Whooo. Where's that lunch by the way? Time to get lost. I mean, he got interrupted in the hallway. Five six seven. Oh, he got intercepted. Five six seven. Five sixty. Palm five sixty on a mobile one line. Did outgo a thing called it there. I just dream that. I had a dream that I'll go. It was going to call the show that they and see. Took a good dump and lost like two or three ounces. I mean, we started out bragging there. He went from what? 307 to two ninety nine and a half or something like that. What's the big deal with that? Some of the week three. Oh seven. They could lose that much interest. You know, with bad bladder controls. Sixty whole year out the more and more. I get it. I get it. I'm hanging my bucket. It's my bag. I can't see what it is on the radio. But it's there. Y'all in pain. I'll now be power. Back when hours 14. That's what is not bad. The room on the floor is not bad. I'm on the bar. I'm in. I'll start with somewhere else. He did. You're going to go blind if you keep touching yourself. Now, ladies and ladies, ladies and ladies. I'm going back to my room. I'm going back to a rosy. My girl needs me to boom. So now I'm going back to my room. Watch it my beard and poor mom have been Muhleta. I'm the rabble in the room on Level Up. WOAH! Good job. Eat something like it Banksuente. Don't cross your eyes without taking And say your going to go blind. It's okay. You keep touching yourself. What can I say? Good job. Whoo! Cheers. I'm cutting the badmass. I'mニ... And it's back, you found me! Now I'm a little older and a little more wide. It's hard to see where I'm shooting as I got mad. Good book that's matter of maintenance, because I think I can't see the foot in my little kingdom, and I'm throwing it some personal questions. I don't know where he's seeing, and I can come join his bus, and pray that I don't know why I'm from all the touching my head. You know, this is very good book. It is very good. Well, 15 at 5.60, you know, this is very good book. It is very good. But you know, the cheese? Well, it is great. For just a second, I thought the cheese was like Bell Vita. Remember Tom Bell Vita? Well, no, it's not though. It's, uh, I was a geek, you know. It's delicious. From the stadium, what is it? Stadium diner? Yes. Nice, Tommy. See, I'm doing the action, because I'm inspired by my good friend Algo Sting. Of course, I've been doing the actions for what day after day, week after week after. Am I losing any weight? No. But I'm holding my own baby. 5.60, 5.60, 5.60 on a mobile one line, getting tremendous response here on a big game Saturday night on Michael Rousseau's column in the paper on Tom Jick's column. And everything else, all these things. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. There's a Fort Lauderdale fire fighter, and I'd like to say something of a good, you know, this is some serious stuff for dealing with that. Right. And for all your listeners, I would encourage them if they're going to come out here to at least, you know, break some marshmallows in the hot dogs. Okay. Thanks. 5.60, 5.60 on a mobile one line. See, I'm turning the market. The dollars, let me stick a look. Well, you know, 236, and I've decked down 21. But the dollars up 237. So when I get out of here today, I'm going home and selling a lot of stock. I am anything I can make a profit on. I'm taking them on the end. I'm going to salt it away because the last half of this year is basically the last year for a month. The white two-cate thing. If you don't, if you don't believe me, the people are going to go off the deep end. Especially after those two hysteria movies come out this summer, then you just don't get it. All you got to do is take a look at these assholes going out there with their families, with their little kids, with their lawn chairs, with their coars, with their beer and weas, to watch the Everglades burn. To realize that people are just as dumb as I've said that most of them always are. 560, 560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. I'm going to go 300 open lines here today. Here's a mobile and bokeh. Hello? Yes sir. Hey Neil. Yes. Oh great. First of all, I hate your show. Second of all, I'd like to know what is your answer. Okay, let's go to a plantation. Hello. Hey Neil. Yeah. Hey, doing sir. Okay. Just want to thank you. If you want to go to a show, my lunch is great. You're the last call on the board. You know how those bricks are up here. You're right. Well, I just want to thank you all year round for getting me through today at work. Today's my birthday and going to a little celebrate. I got a couple people I like to call it douche bag. I don't know why I played that. I really don't. Richie, yes. I didn't hear what he said. So just in case. 560, 705, right in the middle of my lunch too. The one time I like that is some people on here now. So I can eat my lunch. You'd love them to say their peace. You know what I'm saying? So they don't do that. They don't. They never operate like in a concert with me. You know, I'm doing ying and they're doing ying. They're doing each other. Another specific Monday here in the Madureee City. You're so predictable folks. Every single Monday. Air media. Unless we were given stuff away. Then their lives wouldn't be nearly as busy as they are when we're not given crap away. They're doing good lunch today, by the way. Nice. No potatoes. No stuff. Why do they have to do that, by the way? Why is it every time you go into a diner or into a diner or into a diner here somewhere like that? They've got to give you toast and those home fries all the way. Do like home fries. I can't eat them. It wasn't easy. Get me that just by itself. I wouldn't be in that crap anyway. They went through the whole potato menu. I couldn't put some home fries on their hash browns. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. And they did it just a bit. Thank you, state and diner, by the way. You even know I paid for. I think I may be having this stuff quite often. So tell Tommy. Here's a mobile and key-west, tell him. Hey, man. Yes, sir. Great. I just wanted to call you. I didn't go to the chance to talk to you last week about the famous restaurant. Yeah. I grew up in Southwest Miami and we used to go to the famous all the time. And I really loved the place. I also loved the other place that was down the road from there. And I think it was more on Collins, which was the governor. Never heard of that. Well, I think that's what the name of it was. But man, they had the greatest desserts in that place, like to die for. But anyway, I remember the famous. It was a dynamite place. And I just wanted to pass that along. That restaurant that ever was in this town. It definitely was. And they had the best deals tickles that I could ever die for. Right. Okay. How do material? God bless you, sir. All right. Yeah. I would never eat the governor. Not this one. Oh, I'd by the way, speak of this one. You notice this time is going on and not really all that much time. This couple of months. We've got, I mean, the hour of fascism has arrived. And it's not just Sunday morning at 10.30 on ABC. More and more, this governor is showing his true colors. And the fact that he's owned lock stock and burrowed by the fanatical religious right. With his goddamn school vouchers. And with his opposition to any and all forms of gambling as much as he can muscle it out. And all the other, all of these things. All these naive people that thought, oh, yeah, Bouch, Bouch, yeah. Bouch this. And Ken Jenny, by the way, are Broward Sheriff. He's right there on his behind. Another fascist and drag. He's doing his best to out to Rudy Giuliani, this Ken Jenny. So I tell you one thing, if you're in Broward even inside with the doors closed and the windows closed, don't even think about touching it, even when you're taking a leak. Okay, I'm telling you that right now, if you want to be on a safe side. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Neil, yes sir. Has anybody mentioned to you that Michael Moore show from last night? No. The officer, do you know who Michael Moore is? No. Guy with him. He's one. He used to have a show called TV Nation on it. Oh, yeah, right. You know, you know that is. He's got a new show on Bravo called the awful truth. Last, we've seen he had, he hired a truckload of fake puretons, people dressed up like puretons. Right. And showed up at Ken Sparshouse in the morning when the guy would believe it as house. All right. It was hysterical. And this week last night, he had this, what a contrast, to Larry King, looking Ken Spars, asked for half an hour the other night. Well, Michael Moore rips the, the rich, the hypocrite, the right one. And he rips them a new one every chance he gets. Yeah. Last night, he's, he called gay rights, the last frontier of civil rights in this country and felt that he had to get involved. So he got this big pink winner, Bego, and loaded it up with gay people and set out to go to every state in the union where they had anti-Sottymilose. Yeah. And basically break every one of them on camera for his report. He wouldn't saw that Lunar Fix fell down into people's canes, right? It fell down. And then he's sitting there interviewing him and the guy's just a maniac and a Lunar Tunes. And then up drive this pink, big pink winner, when a Bego, when a Bego. And they start rocking it back and forth and just kind of like publicly breaking the Sodomy Laws. They showed up at the, uh, jump on in the hop in and join in. And they showed up at Trent Lot's house, uh, one morning, uh, not that's not a lot. Uh, not that Trent is gay or anything. Oh no. Just a cheerleader. Right. From old myth. He's a play-hunting op-the-old time-pom to keep in shape. It was a hoome and I think you would enjoy it. Uh, you might check it out sometime. John Bravo. John Bravo, I'm sorry to be with my, uh, mouthful of food. Am I sorry to be? No, not really. Because I can do it more delicately than some others. So I was told the other day. Although it's not that easy to eat an omelet. And talk at the same time. You know, is in my apology? No, I love it. Good omelet. Thank you so much. Let me say it again. See, I figure if I keep sucking around in maybe five, six, seven, five, sixty, no, it's inexpensive. I can handle the five or six bucks whatever it was. And then the $10 tip for Tommy. Where are we going? How come I must be Mario? Oh, mobile and tap in the wonder I was resisting. Hello? Yo. Yes, sir. Yo? Yeah. Yo, isn't Jerome. Yeah. And so what's your fluctuation with men's in it? Oh, brother. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty on a mobile one line. Good calls, you're wrong. Call us again next to here. So as you get your finger out of your rectum. Here's Miami. Hello? You haven't dirty now. Do you want to say it? It's Monday. Good calls. Guys, they're waiting, you know, several minutes for this crap. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello? Hi, no. Hi. I just wondered in today's Harold. Did you see where? And Bishop, that's Andy Pays. Yes, I did, man. I already touched on that and have a nice day. There are a little bit slow today. Okay? There are a little bit slow. Talked about that before. Didn't have any comment when I was talking about it. But guess what? Have a nice day. Right. Lovely lady. Oh, God. The Sandy Peyton people. The old, the desperate. Wasn't not that we had a call from Irving Schindler last week. That wasn't bad enough. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, p, 5, 60 on the mobile one line. The Sandy Peyton show is off the hearing. We'll actually. Does anybody care? No. Was anybody listening? No. I mean, that's like saying, Lawrence, go Marty's off a Waxi 2.

There is so much to find my stone. I'm star ski in Hutch lunch five. And the sign picture of while he catch. I'm spending too much time on eBay. This is how I spend my day. Oh, I'm just spending too much time on eBay. Been in time. I've been awake for days now. Don't care how high it goes. Come on. I have one thing to live for. You get that kung fu gritty. I don't care.

Doesn't. beginning that that winter book coming out and I wouldn't be surprised at all. Those young demographics that Tom Jick was writing about. Huh? Those big numbers that he was talking about. They're clamoring. That was the word. They're clamoring to get on because of the youthful wonderful demographics of the morning show on his days. Does anybody believe that? No. Do they believe it? No. 560560, palm five 60, on the mobile one line. Here's a mobile in-temper pine, hello. Maybe else, Gus. I don't know why I just said my name. Anyway, I just saw the funniest commercial the other night was watching the Howard Stern TV show. Yeah. And it was a commercial for the Treasure Island, you know, Newdy Bar? Yeah. And it was Roberto Durand was on it. I mean, talk about a low-life. In the commercial he's fighting with this stripper, you know, with gloves. And at the end of the commercial, she beat him and he says no-moss, no-moss. Yeah. I just thought that was funny. I don't know if you had a booter. Okay, thanks. 560560, palm five 60, on the mobile, did you think that was funny? No. Was it amusing? No. Mildly interesting? No. Relatively. No. 560, palm five 60, on the mobile one line. This audience is out of material. I declare right now. There it finished. Stick a fork in and baby. His Bob Prince would say they're done. Here's Davey. Hello. Yes, sir. I know it's Monday, but I'll try and give you a good call. Why do you want to run the, you know, the, you know, I really feel bad for hearing. We have to listen for why? Because I go through this every day. This is Miami. This is South Florida. What you hear is what you get? No, I know. It's retard, Bill Mann. Well, here's the story. I ask you several questions. How about that came on Saturday night? The last game of the year. I wasn't there. Two spy reports. The stuff after the, you know, the fan appreciation. Did they give stuff away? Did they stick their finger on each other's back? Probably what was going anything? Do I get a response? No. No matter what it is. Tom, pickle with his idiotic thing in the sun set. Will we get a response about that? No. Sandy Payton, uh, get the million dollars because that big bad bull like from channel 10 left in Or will. Any response about that? No. Except the woman calling to repeat the same thing. I read an hour ago. No. Go ahead. I'm sorry. Okay. Well, let me lift up now. I'll try and talk about something intelligent with you. Here's here's a nice little religion story. I was like, maybe cousin who died when he was born because he was premature. So, um, one of my aunts and the family calls up and, you know, just talking to me about it. And she's like, you know, trying to understand that and she's really religious. And she's like, oh, well, you know why is he going to do that? It happened because we're trying to understand why the baby died. She knows the died from premature, but just like an existential reason trying to understand that. And she says, oh, it's because God needed an angel and heaven. Yeah. And so I was like, you know, I just totally went off and ever that that's where she was. He needed an angel and heaven. Why didn't he take him salmon? But for that's what I'm saying. You know, they don't understand. I mean, if God first of all, God will powerful. He doesn't have any needs. And the other thing is that if God needed an angel and heaven, you think you take a little bit of it. But don't you have to, I want you to understand the juvenile way that the world, and especially this country, the way they function, somebody dies. Oh, he's in heaven now or God, like you said, God wanted him to. For what? What is that? It's just a rationalization because the human beings in his country cannot cope with death. They can't cope with the finality of death. They can't stand it. Exactly. Make up all these ridiculous stories that even a moron wouldn't believe. I'm going to tell you right now, so I really believe this. There is in one percent of the people in this country who really believe in God. Okay. I don't care what they say they believe in. Keep keeping mind the difference, okay? Between what they will tell you and what they really believe inside between their ears. There aren't one half a one percent of the people who are that dumb that they really believe in a God. Right. There's pretty, every year of God. And if you're rocker to believe in that crap. You think of God would need an angel, we take Arnold Schwarzenegger or someone like that. Well, Maria Schreiber with no chin. Have you ever heard of Pascal's leader? Yes. And people think that that's such a logical thing. And it's actually totally illogical. I mean, for those in the audience that don't know, in Pascal's leader, is when people say, oh, well, I better believe in God because, hey, if I don't read it. You're in case, yeah. Right. So, but then I realize that what if the God isn't the Christian God? First of all, you can't pretend you believe it either. You really do believe it or you don't believe it. And quite frankly, how does God know if you believe it in it? It's got also a mind reader. Yeah. He also is inside your head. He's at there's five big and creatures crawling around on this planet. He's inside everybody's head at the same time. Right. And that's enough to say God bless you. That's another thing I can't stand. And have a great day. Thank you. It's like these people, you go to a stick in this yesterday. You go to a ball game or like a hockey game. And they, by the way, Jill, I shot. I kept this thing with her name on it just because she did such a great job with the Montreal Game last Wednesday. Jill, minor. Nice, God. Jill. She's saying both national anthem. She came over to say hi before the game. Remember, she was the first one that called. And then of course, Beth Cohen was also great. We got two knockout young ladies there. Jill, minor and Beth Cohen, bring them back for next year, baby. Oh, Jill, you did a wonderful job of the national anthem and O'Cannon at the bottom. Very nice. Nice lead on sweetheart. And yesterday at the Gretchewe retirement, which we've had no calls about today, maybe one in the first hour, not that I really want to talk about it. What those are to say, it makes me sick. But they sang both national anthem there in New York, even though there was no Canadian team plan. They gave to give both singers an opportunity to stick Wayne Gretchewe's name in the national anthem. Yeah, and the last line of both of them, I forget how it went, you know. They stuck his name in there. Sac religious men. And why do people when they play the national anthem? Why do they what they're standing there, put their hand over their heart? They got heartburn, is that what it is? From that crappy food in the macarina? Yeah. That must be it. They're going like, they're trying to bring it back up. What does that mean when you put your hand over your heart when they're doing that corny national anthem crap? Huh? That's the civilian salute. What does that mean? It's a fascist ritual. Yeah, right exactly. That's my point. What's the point? Put your hand over your heart. Is that make you better than all the rest of us? Yeah, thank you. But you're funny, baloney goose stepping sheep. Ever see a goose stepping sheep all the time? Oh, millions of them. 560, 750, 560, pound 560, animal the one line. We couldn't squeeze a response out of you, bastard. If we paid you by the word. Oh, you're so so. You know something, you guys are so freaking boring. You're what's wrong with this town. People who think that they're just a real panic man. Boring, randomly Pilots, all these money, mking likes. Fingers and another effective, because you're being relevant. You're not that probably going to take their particular sclerons when you say you're at risk by touching Khouse's feet. And right now, it's just these green jeans and stuff. Please,ICESlo, even lady. Oh, babe, do you? Maybe? Can you or Claire come here? And you two you'll certainly be seen with them. But don't you think it's a lie to him, or why, I mean, you're ret至 gefunden. that's the way you can do that. To be honest, I could never make it with the bait until I got Pupisha. Now I have to shave my butt once a week. You can have the same results when you order Pupisha. And now you can order through the internet at www.fuzzybut.com. Order today. What do you say, you can't be real mad unless you have here on your butt because I noticed that I don't want to mention Greg Reed. When he took his pants down before and moon this right here in a studio and showed us his ugly pimpley. There was no hair on his butt. Maybe they shaved it to treat the injury. Maybe Joe Castello shaved his butt. Huh? What about Greg's? What about Roy? 560, 560, 560 on a mobile one line. We're just rolling along, signal us on, killing four hours for your boys and girls. And doing a sensational job if I might add so my son. I'm doing a phenomenal job under these circumstances on to make believe radio station on all spots radio. With a general manager that walks around with his pants out of his knees. And I got news for Greg. This ain't the sales office. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes, sir. Let me ask you a question a couple of weeks ago. You said something about Ron and Ron coming on the air and I've been gone for a couple of weeks. Right. What's on the hand of the May 1st? Oh, May 1st? Mornings May 1st. Goodbye, Worst team. Goodbye, all of them. Oh, geez. Okay. Well, wait a minute, O.G. is that bad? Well, I mean, Ron and Ron. Who would you rather have? Who would you like to stay with a more? How about Bob and Tom? I don't know what he ever's out there. I mean, I wouldn't mind having written about that. What do you like the morning show? Do you like the Worst team? Not really. Do you like guilty? I definitely don't like guilty. You like default. People's okay. You like a little dog, Joe Rose. Yeah, he's all right. I'm going to tell you all mind to show. But if guilty were off of there, you'd like it better. I don't want to put words in your mind. I agree. You'll be the voices annoying and although he has some knowledge of hockey doesn't have enough. The voice and the ass sucking are the two things that disturb me tremendously greatly. I agree. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Bob and Tom start mornings. Whatever he wants, we'll put them on. Okay. Rick and son. Starting mornings on May 1st. Whatever that day is second third. You want Rick and son in a morning? You got him. Five at nine. Five six seven. Five six. Five six. The pound five six. The animal will want to give a little bit of a plug. Okay. Let's go some up there. Maybe if we get their numbers up there like neck and neck nose. Those will make it these morning guys off their dead ass. Improve that show there's and quit sucking so much damn ass. So much hairy ass. God, even defending that Cecil Collins. Crapped this morning. I mean, I couldn't believe that. I know what a butt sucking a full little jelly is. But when he's the. Well, they mean he got nothing to lose. You know, you know, something Jimmy Johnson or Brian Murray or Terry Murray or John Henry. They could come in here and drop 10 pounds of manure right there on Jell these faces. Oh, that's the most delicious manure I've ever tasted in my life. Please bring some more. That's what kind of a little quit that is. Okay. A little butt sucking twit. Here's more waterdale. Hello. Yo, Neil. Yes, sir. I call the comments of a color. I don't know. And what's that? Pardon me. And which one is that? Something about in factuation with men's asses or something like that. Yeah. Who's that? Who's in fact what it would men's asses? You know, I'm not. Seems like. I'm not the least but interested men's asses. Nor did I tell our general manager to come in and show his ass. I couldn't care less about that. I see. I told him when he was in there right to his face. He's been showing people his ass here ever since he came in the building the first time. Why? Why does that concern you, sir? Why would you? Unless you have absolutely no material whatsoever. What does that mean? I don't think I need to have material to call your show except for to make a comment. And what does that mean? And the cop. I'm not going away. And this is another guy. See, you can't. It doesn't make any difference. How many times you try it, pal? Because it's number one. Not going to get on here. And number two, you wouldn't be listening if you really wanted me to go away. So obviously something I've said today. This stirb him. Okay. Maybe he's got a fetish with Jimmy Johnson. Okay. The fact that I said Jimmy is the gangster coach. I mean, you can go through the whole litany of things I said here. They're something that stirb this guy. The sooner that I go away, I have an obsession with men's rectum, according to him. Okay. I don't have an obsession with anybody's rectum. Okay. To me, it's the least interesting part of the body. And the fact that we find out a lot of you so called and I underlined the so called part. Module guys are obsessed with women's rectum. Well, there you go. Maybe that's what he's upset about. Is that we brought him out of the ass closet. Here's a mobile and holly with. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I don't want to. Like the dog bang at the moon. Yes, sooner you go away. I'm not going anywhere, pal. I don't want you to go. I'm not going with you. Why don't you want it or not? I don't want to listen. I got you home in a little while. Okay. I don't blame you. I want to just talk real fast about religion. I'm going to call this plus my ass man. Yeah. I got to tell you. Or maybe he was a God stuff that bothered this guy. Maybe he's another emotional cripple that can't handle the truth about the God bull Crem. Well, now that we get on me because flesh are to create it created everything. Yeah. created the bad. You know, these people are like they just want to know about the good and they blame the devil for the bad. That's why they had to invent the devil because, you know, they're making it. I mean, this this earth really sucks. Right. Why we see going on over season. You're all around us. We see people crashing in airplanes. On quake floods. Great. So we're creating all kinds of diseases. All kinds of viruses. All kinds of bacteria that are. If I would tell you that a human being would do this crap and create all this. So you would turn away from that. She was put him on death row. We say crazy. And all of it to love me. I created all this crap. Right. He needs is incredible. 50 to a five 60 W QA and that guy's absolutely correct. Take a look at what's going on over there. And you wish lobby all these poor desperate human beings. I mean, this crap that's going on. And all these diseases and these. Uh, draw resistant back to strains of bacteria and on and on it. Go see nature. You can understand nature. This is the way nature works because that's the real world. But for people that want to live in this fantasy world, like that jackass that call the couple calls to go, I know who you are sir and you can't turn it off. Can you can you turn it off? No. You'll never turn it off. The minute I, uh, I, uh, hang it up. Then you'll, uh, turn it off. But in the meantime, he couldn't turn this off if you paid him by the minute. Because he's obsessed with this show. And they always have to do to try and reflect attention. You know what? Oh, I'm obsessed with rectum. I'm obviously, no, I'm not obsessed with rectum. Sir, I haven't got the least bit of interest in you. And you were rectum, even in my rectum, okay? Even my, uh, formerly bruised rectum. Or a Greg Reid's purple rectum. How do you like that? Eee! That's what I thought when I saw it. That's the first thing that came to my mind when the boss is in there pulling his pants down. Eee! Oh, god. Here's a man that runs around a building showing his ass rectum to the world. And he, uh, I was going to say he signed the paycheck. He don't even do that. He puts like a little squiggly mark on there, which means there might be enough in the back of the account this week to cover it so you can give him his paycheck now. Here's Miami. Hello. He's clearly not showing it. Yeah. Are you there? Oh, good. I got rid of him. He had his way. And your radio turned up, sir. Bad telephone technique. Don't talk to people that got their radio blasting in the back. Oh, we got a bunch of winners here today. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pon 5, 60 on the mobile one line. Here's a lady in adventurer. Hello. Yeah, I mean, I think you're still an unofficial rabbi, even though you're an atheist. What does that mean? Well, because I think you have the intellect of a rabbi was always searching for the truth. You know, I'm not searching for anything. Well, let me ask you this. Haven't you had called me and told me exactly the same thing before? Yeah, exactly. Let me ask your questions. Uh, if there's no creator who created a space, time and matter. I haven't got any idea. Didn't the nature, it's just there. Nobody created it. Let me ask you this. If there's a God who created him. Well, that's the, that's the dilemma. Ah, that's the dilemma. Well, what's the difference in that question between that and the one you asked me? Because somebody must be creating something. Uh-huh. Just like just like there must be a beginning in the end because that's the way everything works in our Exit and our experience. There must be a beginning in and in. Not necessarily. Why not? Because maybe there's infinity. Oh, and so there's infinity. Maybe maybe the universe was always here. What a concept. Well, but even infinity has has a boundaries, I think. Yeah, like they can't say certain words on here on their stations, right? Oh, well, it's worth thinking about. No, it's not. Well, what's going to answer what difference does it make? Because there may be a possibility that you're wrong. About what? A creator. A creator, like a person, like a guy with a long beard and long hair, like a long time. How long does that mean? Nothing is Monday. Something, something. Something that creates time. Yeah. I don't know. A high and what would that thing be? I'd like that. Oh, well, when you find out you call me back and let me know. She's she started out to call exactly verbatim word for word. I'm not how many times over the years she's called when that same song I did. Word for word. She's probably got it written down. Maybe she's got it memorized, but I'll see you out to and makes no sense whatsoever. Something's gotta be there. It doesn't it? No. No. Do I care? No. And she can handle it. Well, maybe someday. No. I don't care. So no interest to me. All these fairy tales. The greatest biblical scholar I've ever knew in my life. Pulled me. It's all about your bubblemises. It's all about your fairy tales. Don't waste your time with it. And I said, okay. And you're right. All these silly ridiculous things. How could anybody see it again? People say that. Like I said before, people say these things because they want us to think that they really believe them. But in between their ears where we can't really read their mind. But if we could, we'd know that they're going like, Yeah. Okay. I don't really believe this crap anymore than he does. But I gotta say it because it sounds good. Because it's the acceptable, the socially acceptable thing to say. Oh, the good Lord, well, and the good Lord, the good Lord, well, and how about stop all these, and say these poor bastards. Look at this there. They've got loads of bread over there in Yugoslavia. Try to look at those people. Look at that. Look at what's going on over there. And you're giving me a bunch of crap about a God. You have that there, Muslims. Oh, that's right. Wrong God. See you, Lose. I don't teach him. God, my fad ass. God, Greg reads, Pimpley. Pecto. He's right. I'm obsessed with rectum. I'd just like to wait a, the cart sound. Yeah. That's mixed Lewis. Although. That's our full question. Which one do you like better? You're like rectum or. Oh, it's mixed Lewis. Jim. What these people are just worry up. 1257 or 550 QM. Do we have any cigars around here for when I leave? I get mom real upset because I haven't smoked at each of the guys in a long time. But I'm going to light one up when I leave today. Just an out of my good friends down at mix. Because you know something. The one thing I can tell you for sure when you get one of those great predomer reserves or any of the great cigars from down there, the Lord didn't make those next made him. How do you like that? Those great cigars. God didn't make him those little banana picking. No one's picking illegal aliens. They made him. They put a lot of love and care and hard work. It'll make an each and one of those great premium cigars and mix cigars. It's not just the one to two hour. It's a phenomenon. When you were born in deep. Friends from high, we look home deep. Friends from high, born. Born deep, friends from high. Born deep, friends from high. Born deep, friends from high. Yes, we would born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born.

He's crying behind your mind when they're going to pass on the dog of the bird. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. Born. out of their homes is because just exactly what these assholes were talking about. Good old time religion, baby. Oh, there you go. Airbie time you see something wrote, test and nasty and unhuman happening in the world and people hitting each other and try to kill each other. Ninety-nine percent of the time that comes back to that good old religion. Oh, try to force it down your throat. So to speak. Here's a mobile implantation, hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I vote for Hawaii. What is this? Your Policure. Okay, great. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60. See what I mean? It's hopeless. This place is never going to get any better. It's a vacuum. There's all real people there out there watching the fires. They got their barbecue going. They don't even have to take their barbecue. They just got their marshmallows in their wienes. They just took them out the window of the car. Oh, it's getting pretty hot now. And then we need to. I'll bet. Here's a mobile informe, Latterdale. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey. Hey, do a Neil. Okay. I was just going to say about the year 2000. What do you think about that? What's going to happen if you're like into God and all that? And everything. And you know, either of those God and this man, they say in the Bible, year 2000, is all wolf and it comes to the end. How long have they been saying, sir? Oh, I don't want to like remember. Let me ask you something. When the date changes, okay? When the date on the calendar changes. What does it mean? Okay. Just another year. The sun and the moon and the stars and the makamon. It isn't going to change your God damn thing. Don't think no one can happen at all. What do you mean by that? At the world can come to an end. It's just like it's all. You're asking me that seriously. You're like, the world's coming to an end. Not to, you know, all the good people are there. So, hopefully not sinners or whatever. We're going to go to heaven. And then everybody else is going to go to hell. Oh, and what are they going to do in heaven, sir? What's going to be going on up there? Uh, like everything's simple. Peaceful. You live with no commitments, no nothing. And you get whatever you want, supposedly, or whatever you want. You get whatever you want, like what? Like what? Like what? Ah. Keep from it. But whatever. No, you say you will go, you get whatever. Well, there's no fighting in a funeral, Brian, a cemetery. It's true. It's a bomb. Huh? Everybody's down there. Okay. Thank you. There's the answer. Peaceful. They're peaceful in the box. Oh, my God. This guy. He's asking me a serious question. Is that any? Yeah. That's the scary part of it. Don't I really believe the year the world has got to come to an end when the calendar changes? Well, I'll tell you one thing, if that's the case, we better start going out and live it up right now. Because we got a short time. We only got eight months in the 11 days left. See ya. Let's stick a tape on. Yeah. I got too many things to do. We only got that little time left. Or you think you're going to be burning in hell. Oh, there's a God for you. If you don't believe a bunch of silly fairy tales, you're going to burn out. And let me ask you something, sir, when you don't have a body, how is it going to feel when you're burning in hell? How do you feel pain when you have no sense of feeling? How do you feel this pleasure? This peace when you have no brain when you have no body? I ain't got nobody. Come on. Let's hear it. How do they, how do they say Peter recognize you? Does he check your DNA? Does he look at your fingerprints? Because you don't have either one when you get to the pearly gates. Okay? There's nobody. There's nothing. There is the soul. Anybody ever see a soul except the one on the bottom of your shoe? No. And by the way, look at what's on the bottom of your shoe. If you stepped in a wrong spot this morning. Does that what you call a crappy soul? I feel like nothing better make sure we're just putting your getting ready to do a sign to check out. Make sure you look at the bottom of your shoes. Because if you wind up dying and just at that particular moment, you have to have like dogs on the bottom of your shoe. Nobody gets in the head when they got a crappy soul. Huh? Straight down. But why? A crappy soul. You lose. Drop. Tom. Can you get me off the hook for all can't do it, Sally? Hey, Sally. Get that up. Oh, we know where she's going. Here's homestead. Hello. Yes, sir. And you. Can I get a request? No. Where we gone? Here's a highly a hello. High a lia. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Just to get on the lighter subject, I took George's advice the sweet and shaved my scrotum. Yeah. And the power to George's advice? That's your cost. Oh, is it? Yes. And the popular consensus is that it's good. Yeah. Women seem to dig it. Women seem to dig it. How do you know that? Yeah. You're highly. I'm sure that it looks good in the glory hole. The popular consensus was that it's good. Women dig it. You see what I mean again about people mind. People mind even some of the people around here. These sports nerds around here. These young macho guys. Most of them who couldn't get laid in the goddamn warehouse. They're running around shaving their balls because Jocac Stellos said his girlfriend likes and the shave is nuts. The stocky to squirrel setty shave is nuts. What everybody out there do it? Yeah. Probably. Talk about impressionable people about sheep with no brain, with no minds of their own. And then lady who keeps asking me year after year, the same stupid question about don't I really care? No. No. No. Don't care. I don't think about it. I'm not interested. How did we get here? No. Do we know? We ever go to know. But difference doesn't make. Does it something to argue about? It's something to hate each other about. It's something to kill each other. So cut the crap. With all your superstition with your foolishness, and by the way, don't step under that goddamn ladder while you're at it. And don't let that black pussycat step in front of your path because you're going to go straight to hell. Something really bad is going to happen. And if you go to the store and they totally your groceries comes up like the 666, you better hope the decimal point after the first six. Because otherwise, something really, really bad is going to happen. That's right. The cashier she's going to say. Uh-huh. Still short. Right. Is that thing real? No. My name is Ross Perola. Stand by five foot goal. Where's the five of six billion? Never thought to check and handle it this thick. But I'm willing. Before I can declare, will this my kitchen hell? Because I was kind of funny. But both parties, I don't know who that says she's always been. I can't grab a guy with money. Cause I can't let go. Hey, all right, Bart, you're in so much money and it's funny. Why don't you go to speak? Can't we see? Yes, cause I am so glad. There's a lot of people up in the world. It's an opportunity for a girl to be. I ain't got your body maybe. I ain't got nobody. I can't feel nothing. I can't see nothing. I can't hear nothing. I can't even smell. Nothing almost. I'm going to heaven. I'm going to hell. I'm going to burn. And of course, burning won't be all that bad because I have no body. I got no skin. I got no sense of feeling. I got no brain. So I'm not even going to feel it. Then it's like does it, does it bear? And it would? No, if a tree falls in a wood, then nobody hears it, does it make a sound. And if you go to hell and you can't feel the fire, are you getting burned? Do it hurt? No. No. And if you go to heaven and you can't feel it, and you're in this blissful, whatever the other cock I was talking about, this piece, piece. I got your piece over here, pal. Maniac. Little to tick. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Neil, how are you? Okay, sir. I want to comment on this religious thing that... I have a religious thing? Well, whatever. Yeah. It's a Bible says at the age of 30, everybody should commit suicide. I can guarantee you maths suicide. You know what I mean? My point is... Part of these things. My point is... Yeah, but I do kind of like great pool, though. Well, I understand that, but my point is... Not to great you got the tapioca pudding. Yeah, a little bit less. I see you're nuts all. Maybe maybe your costal is a little bit later, the door ain't me guys, go ahead. Right. My point is... The head of Lady on a couple of minutes ago or whatever. She was talking about creator and your rabbi or whatever. Oh yeah. Her same old tired boring line. Yeah. And the creator and the step. You know, you could take a glass of water and stick it out in the hot sun for more by the day, then you created something because something's going to go in there. What I know. You know what I mean? My point is... How do we know? How do you butterfly my drop a little something in there? Yeah, I mean, I think... Be floating around on top. Well, I think it goes back to the old saying. Keep it up with the Joneses as far as... No, it's not the old saying. The old saying is that people are sheep and people don't want to think of themselves. And so people even if they know that it's a bunch of crap, they don't have the guts to say it. They feel like they can help. Like when they do these polls in America, 97% of the people when they say they believe in God, they say, Even though 96 and 9% and 10% of them know it's a bunch of bull crap. Right, right. Well, either way, there's too many people that... That follow these polls. I mean, they could say whatever. And they'll... Well, what do you call it? All of them are coals. They're not nearly religion in the world. It's a cult. Right. That's what I'm saying. Well, God bless you, sir. 560505050. It's Rabbi Niel. Oh! Lady, you're so boring. You have any idea how boring you are, sweetheart? How boring, how terminal, how repetitious? How, I mean, very infrequent calls, but it's always the same thing. How many times can we hear? Without starting to be grudges tape them, you don't want talking about sweetheart, I don't think you do. I don't think you get it. Oh, Rabbi Niel. Yeah. I got you read by wrote over here, sweetheart. Right by the short hairs. And don't get me started on your account again. Okay, because I can't stand it. He's laying at the fill in. He's rocking back and forth. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's me, Bob, we're gonna call you. I, I, I, I, I, I. And you look at somebody like that and you say, Please, lock him up. Please. Put him away. I'll take over 16, please. Yes. Here's Miami, hello. I'm sorry, is this just taking a group of speaking? Let's go to a mobile and Hollywood, hello. Hey, Niel, I, this is a religious stuff. We're gonna be able to get out. We're gonna be able to get out. We're gonna be able to get out. We're gonna be able to get out. I'm right over here, Germes. I'm sorry, it's hypocrite. These people are absolutely nuts. Yeah. Everyone, all these religious fanatics are absolutely nuts. Well, what are these fanatics? If it's making it into a bit of a fanatical or not, if they're fanatical, of course, they're doing a lot more harm with it. That's what makes it worse. Make them malignant. Well, you see, they just, they just don't get it. I mean, the best thing in life is to be the best person you can be. I mean, regardless of religion. And of course, the NH, baby, who don't harm it? The simplest religion makes all the sense in the world. The NH, if everybody would D NH, we would have to clear it. This guy's talking about peace and tranquility. We could have it right here. D NH, stop killing everybody. Stop driving people out of their homes. Stop raping women. Stop doing all of these things. You go to these, we do the Christian rights and all that stuff. I mean, if you're not born to the correct religion, you're not going to be saved. So I guess the Jewish firefighter who gives a life saving 40 people in the building is. Yeah, he did, he did his people decided that there were God's chosen people. So maybe he, who knows? Yeah, well, every religion says, we're the chosen people. If you don't believe what we believe, you're going to hell. Every religion says that really a lot of much in the talk of it. Of course, craft disease. And it would, it would from their point of view, they'll, I mean, from the Christian point of view, I know, I mean, there's a lot of them. If, you know, this guy, you know, gives his life, you know, saving people 30 people. It's a lot of burning people. He's no burning in hell. He's burning people. Except that Jesus on his death thing is going to have it. But the Christian mass murderer of 20 who gives, who says, I found Jesus in a cell before he gets electrocuted is going to be saved. Or five, Jesus on Rick Riley's lawn. That's right. Absolutely. Well, I love about that. I don't know what that one. So what does life use is his life lost it? All right, just amazing. And if they believe that, you know, God created the heaven and earth, no people. And afterwards they're going to be saved. Well, he controlled which soul comes down here then, right? Yeah. So he knows the head of time who's abandoned his not their damn before they do. And what happens if you like the Beatles got a rubber soul, what do you do then? Well, I at least say you won't get shocked when you go to hell. But before they do, and then they do, then it's or ball. Well, don't waste your time on it, pal. Just the school. It's for longer. They're going to be old for you. Okay. Hey, thanks. Yeah. You kind of like ourselves, the problem to say we're hovering door. Good luck, Darra. I'll say yeah. She's gone. I'll say her no more. As the QAM sales department keeps spinning and spinning and spinning and turning. Whatever happened to the guy that wanted the books about Italy, which I keep forgetting to bring in. I was almost going to bring them in this morning. I thought he's probably gone through already. What's his name? The tall young sales guy that wanted the books, I don't even know what his name is. How can you learn the names of the sales people when you're here for five minutes? And then we got a new one we're placing them. Like that Peter Leonard Leonard Peter, pumpkin eater, whatever his name is. That group ball. He's like one step away from the thing. That's right. That's what we got ourselves the department. All of these things. Yeah, right. Fat boy. Here's a mobile and Palm Beach, Chilo. Mobile and Palm Beach. Yes. Mr. Rod, you're speaking. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The Christianity is not a religion. What is it? The personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Uh-huh. What does that mean? What does that mean? How do you have personal life you have lunch with them or take them out for dinner? Nope. I don't know what it means. What does that mean? It means that Christianity and it's not a religion. Yes, it is. Christianity. How can you be a Christian unless you have faith? I've asked you believe in something. That caught a religion. That's what religion is. No, it is not. It is a personal relationship. You're giving me your given on rhetoric. So you're giving or rhetoric. You give a cornball rhetoric. You do not have to be a press material or a Catholic or any denomination. Yeah. Really a religion. To have to be a Christian. Christian Christianity. That's a Christian. That's according to you. No, that's according to the Bible. No, that's not a court of the Bible. Let's not a court of the teaching. The Bible is way implemented by the Catholic Church and the Protestant. The Orthodox Church and the Protestant. They're all man's own attempt to explain Christianity. To a Christianity is not a yes or a yes or a yes. You mean to explain the religion that was invented many years after this alleged person. Jesus died was nailed on the cross and allegedly came back. The Christianity has. Quickly to do with the individual when God created everything he created. The free well-man and the sovereign the God live on together and it's man's own choice. Whether he believes or not believes. And it's not. And how about how about the people in the parts of the world where they never hear the message of Jesus? How about those people? Because it's going to have to hear them. There is no such thing as an unfair situation. It's someone in the parts of the world that does not hear the man. Maybe they don't have people there. Like in the General's of Africa somewhere. They would automatically be saved. They would be saved. They would be saved for what? For a rainy day what happens to them? No sir. In other words, everybody reaches God consciousness at some level. Some of the bodies. A new reach of God consciousness at a certain age. Then you were responsible from your actions. Didn't know. Didn't know the New Testament doesn't say whoever she'll believe in in this bubble by sea. We'll have everlasting life. Only the ones who believe in it. No sir. But let's take the one from the state father. Right. That's right. Let's take a child. And bring it on. And then make him and take a child. Let's take a child. That's not what we should do. God's money. He's not. He's not. He doesn't do what? He doesn't. Let's take a child. It doesn't reach God's consciousness. What does that mean? What does that mean? You keep using all the flowery hours. Thousands of children. Doesn't reach God's consciousness. That's correct. Because God consciousness is one point to realize there's a God and you have to make a choice. That's a choice of one. Nothing is in a Bible. He's saying, you're just making all of this on. You've got your own religion. You're just making it up as you go along. I'm not. And if you if a child is not reached God's consciousness. Yeah. Okay. Have a great day. So you repeat the same thing. 400 times. Once we've got to the 400 times. Once we've got to the 400 times. What's up? Next. Next. Looney Tunes. 560. 560. 560. On the 18T. I wouldn't be surprised that they eat belly together. Maybe they had a Passover sater together this year. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Because when Jesus was alive by the way, there was no Christian religion. Pretty good sir. He was your who. Do you remember that you? You're in Rift. A last couple was a Passover sater. He was drinking a wine and there a burden was spilling it. Yeah. Go ham sir. Are you okay? I'm fine. You're in Rift for today. Yes. This religion thing just gets you in a knock. No. It doesn't get me in a knock. It's these people in a knock. Anyway, they're bringing out all the wine. I wanted one thing. I haven't heard it for the longest time. Yeah. Four knock. I'm not sure if you've got. Okay. Right. See you. In last says that it must have been a high-light player. It works the lotion in the basket. Okay. There you go sir. Just for you. That's another religion too. I'll put the lotion in the, uh, sports court. Your basket. And that's why they have Paul Bears at funerals, you know, because they're the ones who put the motion in the basket. Well, you don't want to just sit in there forever. See you in the fashion in the shirt. How I love the liquor, put it in that as well. I become a singing lesbian. None. Is there very taster when we're so with friends with what I done today? Be act them with her son. Oh, and you can see for their families that's just someone's number one. They pass by while it's on none. Found a way to make some passion. Hope the royal seats will last a little bit. It's hired none. So get none. I never made it that big cause I did and look that great. So I got the on-new habit to instruct them getting laid. Had my one, only hit them that bad. It can got hit the Pope's that there's my big. Well, that I'm dead. I can't reveal how much I wanted Sally to go with him in my week. Okay, one pretty wanted five 60 WCM. The Pope's greatest hits by the way. Number four were the bullet. Oh, over and Italy. Doesn't case you're a keeping track. It's a monster. Five six seven. Five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. Just look around you. Look at the rampants to pitety. The rampant ignorance, the suffering, the famine, the hardships to disease. Air be here. We come up with new diseases, new strains of bacteria. Is God doing anything about all these things? No. No. He's too busy worrying about who's vet and I'm which she's team at the football. He's because they're all having their goddamn NFL prayer breakfast. No, it's another bullet crap. And praying to God. Because oh yeah, and by the way, you'll be pleased to know that this Cecil Collins come back that Jimmy assigned the other day. Or that they drafted at least yesterday. This Cecil Collins says, oh, he's found God now. So now everything will be okay. Right. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, I knew. I got to ask you questions. You got to one. Ask you questions. Ask me a question. Yeah. If you say you're pubic and you gay. Yes. What if you clip them with a clip? If you clip your clip with a clip or yes, that makes you gay too. Don't do it, sir. 560, 50560, pump 560 on the AT&T Rottles line. Here's four Myers. Hello. Hello. How are you? Okay, sir. Say I agree with you. They're killing you over there. That audience is there ruining your show. They're getting worse and worse. We've only been listening until you're for about a year. Yeah. On his coast. And in that amount of time, it really has gotten noticeably bad. And then in that amount of time, it's not any different than it was five years ago. I got the same one kids here that have always been here. Oh, they, and when they move out, they croaked. We bring a new one kids to replace them. I thought I was hearing you say to third, getting progressively worse. No. No. That's a, that's the same old crap. Well, I was going to offer a suggestion. I think it's rather brilliant. What is that? Maybe just for like a week or, or so, you can test taking all your calls from this coast and make them pay over there. You know, to call over there. Make me coupé. All the people from the East Coast make them call a West Coast. And then you can get all the idiots on this coast. It really feel like goes. Yeah. Okay. Thanks, Tom. Thanks for no thanks. 5.670. 5.6. 5.6. We don't have enough men and men to muscle to talk to the people over there on the West Coast. The grandparents of the people live in sunrise live on a West Coast of Florida. They're over there in Fort Myers and in Naples and in Tampa and St. Pete and queer water. And, uh, tarp and springs, all of these places, all of these things. Why do I have the thing doing? Haven't seen the thing lately. Here's a wrong line. Here's a mobile and four-laternal hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Man, this is Christianity's up effect. You don't it? No. You're sounds like it? Not upset in the least. Well, are you upset? I'm just enjoying it, man. I just haven't agreed to. I'm just doing my thing here. I'm not the lead. I couldn't care less what these are both, I'll say. Would you like me to say I'm upset? Would that make you feel better? No, I don't have to make. Another make me feel better. I'm a radio. It's entertainment, man. Exactly. It's a radio show. It's just entertainment. It's like they made up their religion so they can entertain each other with end of their killings. There you go. Right. Okay. I got a lot of you, sir. Got a lot of material. Here's West Kendall. Hello. Yes, sir. There's a place in Florida that all these religious priests should go to. Uh-huh. And that is, uh, the<|ko|>. The<|ko|> u're trying to help out a lot of them. The<|ko|> hct had a хороший view. Alectad shallow and clear and metres sola pond 8 пап. West Kendall's fault is grow totally different from our own temporary printers. 많 the yard area and there are such a huge variety of personnel in the hospital. There are groups that headbuild their home, their immersive area and theirmäßig and breath. But they're82 have mostly strategies- Taking down maternity care can be there for, buckling down decrease of WW6 in M4- too. Right away. Twenty six oh. But as far as the truth, am I looking for the truth? What truth are you talking about? You are truth? Why should you publish truth? What truth are you talking about? What theory tale which who made up? What silly story for silly emotional cripple people who can't accept the fact that when you die, your dead, your dead, your dead, period, and of discussion, not because God wanted you, because your time was up, because of whatever, because crap happens. That's what they, that's the answer to that question. I mean, some people they croaked, who were smoking tree packs the cigarettes a day, and they died because they got a long cancer. It killed them, okay? Very simple. Nothing complicated at all. They killed themselves with crap, just like some of us kill ourselves with food. Like my close personal friend, who called before the Fat Al Goldstein, who lost six ounces over the weekend, and lost his to write a book about it. Put up one of those good year of bluffs, really, you have to rent a good year of bluffs. We'll just tie a string to Al's ass and stand him up in a year. We'll just stick a helium pump up Al's rectum, stand him up there with a C 105. I'm sorry, 298 pounds. That's incredible. Can you believe that? But it's good. I'm trying to scare him for years, just like we're trying to do with the books through there. Share him out of the eating. At least even if you don't lose any weight, don't expand anymore. Don't expand. And now that he's terrified that he's going to be on insulin, have it to take those shots, have it to take the needle, like Sherlock Holmes Watson, have it to take that needle all of the, he says, oh, maybe I'll lose an ounce or two. Maybe I'll leave like half upon a cereal in the industrial box and leave it for somebody else. Remember all those times he would do that, bring in the, like they used to sell an extra, remember extra would sell, they used to have like for families, being in dust for a school, for a class for an entire school, a huge box of cereal, preferably loaded with sugar like frosted flakes which I do like by the way. And he would sit there doing the show and eat the whole goddamn box as like, like a side dish to whatever we were having for lunch that day. Whatever we were having for our two or three meals that day. Like Don Delo, we said, maybe we could have a couple of meals together. Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach, hello. What is buttons are killing me, mobile and West Palm, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Great. I was just wanting to get off this religion thing, maybe mentioned something about Wayne Gretzky briefly. Yeah. And that is that they've been talking about this passing the torch to Yager thing. I don't know, they, like he passed it last night. I think Yager's are the torch for about three years now. Yeah. That's been a shadow of his former self for the last couple of years. It's pain, I can't stand it or begin with. It was a great player. But to watch him go, you go around every time somebody would just hit him just barely touch him. He put his hands on that little pansy helmet. It is and go skate over the bench like, oh, they touched me. I'm so glad he retired and didn't have to go out like a clown. His time was up.
