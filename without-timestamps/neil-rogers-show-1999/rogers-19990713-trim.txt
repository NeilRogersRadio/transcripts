We're going to lose more chance. Why would it change? I was with UAM. My happy boy's waterdale present. The Neal Rogers Show. To know. The Neal called 567-0560-tole-free for David Raoad Air or Pound 560 on your cell call. The opinion of Neal, his guest's callers. Anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM. Beesley, weed acquisitions or the Beesley Broadcast booth. Now, Neal Rogers on Sports Radio 567-tole-A have no buttoned repulsors. You more. All right. I don't get you keep on getting up my bad. I'm playing you, come down there with you. You can't help my breath, they're talking about my 30 days. You come on to me and let the things in my head. And I'm lost, but if you wanna tell me you know everything about me, don't think you know. Yes, I'm on my head. I'm a tendency to shoot that damn thing. Okay. Good you could go to jail and then you need my name. If I'm free, you'll end up friends on me. She was 25 but she's just a few. Don't think he, I've been my name for three days. Daddy called the call for me. I got some perfect and things like those I have to tell me. No matter what you think about me, I got to think about you. Oh my gosh. What does he do? He's okay. Oh. He's just a piece of hair. He's a man who holds those friends later than time and time. He's just a piece of hair. I'm actually a little bit high. I got a cranked up because I love that song. I love the song. I love the parody that I just played. I don't know what to do. Anyway, getting back to what they were saying right there. We're never less at the end of the worst team this morning. See, the thing in it and the tires and whatever the else that goes on with this town. That no matter how you slap the public in the face, they're always in the house. It's like, if I opened up a restaurant, I said, you know something, the food is really going to suck. The prices are going to be too high. The food is going to taste like crap. And I open up the doors and people come in. And they're buying my sloth. Yeah, I mean, it's not like loaded. It's not like jam packed like McDonald's and places like that. But nevertheless, there are people, you know, a steady flow of customers and I'm like eating out a living. And I get out there and put on the street with a megaphone, I say, don't you? People understand the food here if at least the next couple of years it's going to suck and the prices are too high. And they keep showing up. That's what's going on here with this Marlon bull crap. That's the problem. We got crazy people here. I must be crazy. I must be nuts. Yeah, you too, John. Yeah. Crazy people in this town. That's why this thing with Mayor of Pinga who definitely ought to be in jail after last 24 hours, I'm convinced the ought to be on death row at least. That's why they're going to pull the wool over the eyes of this public and push this thing through. And wait till you hear this, if he haven't already heard the statement he released yesterday about to 75,000 toll boats that we're going to have if you don't give him this penny sales tax. Not that it's blackmail you understand. It's unbelievable. And see, again, who are the people that are really causing the problems that are getting sucked into all the panic like some jackass they interviewed this morning on Channel 4. Of course, I'm sure he was the only motorist out there available on the highway to be interviewed, but he's the one that we see. And his BMW or whatever it was driving. Oh, I don't care if it's 2 cents, 3 cents, whatever the sales tax is just to get these greater of these tolls and let me you drive. And I'm thinking to myself, God damn it, they're going to suck the public. They're going to pull this off. They're going to pull this off. Even his transparent as it is, but getting back to the idiots again and morons. Just like the, the, the, the, the, the few thousand people are keep showing up for those Marlon games, even though they keep coming out and saying, oh, we're going to stink. We're not going to win. We're terrible. We're a bunch of like a little puppy kids at every time we get somebody that you like. We're going to trade him away. Even if they are still young guys and I'm making a lot of money, we don't care. And they still keep showing up. And it's the same with these idiots who can't figure out the 50 cents on a toll road. Why do we have other than the fact that we've got lots and lots of assholes in this town, who don't belong on a road in the first place. But that aside, why do we have all this massive traffic jam up because instead of 25 cents, it's 50 cents. You've had to have been in a cocoon last several days, not to know by now. It's 50 cents on those expressways. How could you not know it? 75 cents on the turnpike are people doing cartwheels on the turnpike? No. It's traffic backed up miles on the turnpike unless there's a wreck. No. It's been that way for a long time. It's been 75 cents in back in those days when Chuck Meyer was having people mark up the thing on a quarter's there and Rick and Suds were going, Is that a good idea? Remember those great days? On I. V. Well that's a long time. That's several years that it's been the 75 cents. And the world didn't come to an end. But for some strange reason, you people are driving dates. Yeah. And it's not like there wasn't a total there in the first place. You follow what I'm saying? It's not like all of a sudden you woke up yesterday morning. And there were toll booths in places where there wasn't one before. There are no new toll booths in date County. There's only a chain spirit. And yet you're getting stuck. You're like participants in this fraud that's going on now. You're co-conspirators. You're part of the goddamn problem. Because you're so goddamn stupid. You can't figure out, okay, it's 50 cents. I'll either have a couple of quarters or maybe I'll just have a dollar bill out and go to, or maybe even better than that. I'll just have to get one of those sunpastings and go flying through there. This isn't like the end of the world, but now comes the mayor of penis yesterday. And this thing, it's like a script of a Broadway play of emotion picture. It's all been written out. It's all been a plan from the beginning. And he releases this statement. What's happening today is just the forecast of things to come. It says mayor penis. And about how the Miami-Dade Expressway Authority MDX, how this increase is just the start. And if we don't get that penny sales tax passed on July 29th, there's going to be 11 new tollplasers. There'll be a tollplas on every goddamn street quarter in date County. And if we don't get that penny sales tax, the tolls are going up to 75 cents in 2001. And the adiatiatiati, etc. and so on. And the MDX plan also calls for the tolling of future value pricing lanes and high occupancy toll lanes along proposed expressway extensions. But the mayor promises, and we know how good his word is, just like he promised to oppose that arena with Mickey Harrison down there downtown for blocks from the older arena. He says, I will not support tolling on future of value pricing lanes or high occupancy toll lanes along proposed expressway extensions if you pass my penny sales tax. But you'll have to take him at his word, okay? We know what that means. We know that when mayor penis speaks, that you can believe it for about a half a second. He says with our inaction and the construction of new tolls, the complete clogging of vital streets in our community will be at every day occurrence. So not that he's going to threaten you and that that they put the new toll and just in time to whip up all this hysteria a couple of weeks before the goddamn election. When everybody's out of town. How come our newspapers? How come somebody in this town somewhere in the news meeting? Isn't the psychotic about this doing cartwheels and summer salts? It's his transparent as looking through a goddamn pan of glass with a glass bin knocked out. It's a pain all right. It's a pain in the glass. Crazy people. And of course you can do it here because like I've said before, there's no passion about anything. Oh yeah, whatever you want, okay, just take it. Just let me drive. Okay, whatever you want. Just break me screw me a stick until me. I don't care. I love it. Just. Right. Boy, it's just, it's amazing. And that's why we have thousands of people that's your all for those ball games because they have no life. It's going to really think we suck. It's going to be bad. It's going to be hot. It's going to be uncomfortable. Hey, where do we get in? How much you want? How much for that cracker jack? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. In fact, you know something I think I have figured out why McDonald's is doing touch a big business. I think I just put my finger on it and the answer to. Ten past ten at five sixty w q a m. You're we tell it too much like it is for there for everybody's own sanity station. You should kiss my rear end. He's amazing. When I show fighting. I like jumping. Something sweet. We have cheese pop in. To get high. He's here to show you. But that's not. So you're good tonight. But my friend, but the label says to you. I'm sorry. I can't imagine. It's been a long time. I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you. Good decision. It's like just me. I say that. It's like that. It's like that. It's like that. It's like that. It's like that. Who's who? Who's who? You got to get. Who? That's a ghost down like it like a friend's up in the dark. It's all good. It's a ghost down. Would you do come when you want to adjust it any day's learning about? It's very easy. I'm in kiss region. It comes out smooth like metavuys. It's comfortable when it's your turn. And it's your turn. No! Don't show get too nice in my mouth. Hey, that's me. Somebody say a baby. Now it's going to show us at half head. And the fastest life to be. There. He's not a bus. What time. Nice going there, Brian. Muffin man closes up shop right in the essence. And this morning, sugar free treats. Not as labeled. Eatery owner faces suit filed by customer. We'll get in at that in a minute. I'll give you back to this thing. take a look at the board right now okay not one single call on there okay except that pain in the estate slater which we appreciate all your good work day because you would return freedom and I'll be only ones that care beside me but I don't really care that much because I don't live in the county and especially if these things go through I don't plan on driving them anymore than I have to anyway. I mean wait till you take a look at the the Westbound dolphin and the eastbound this one and the Ashula and the state road 12 where we already took the one booth down all over the guy down place every five blocks there be another tool booth another eleven more reasons why you shouldn't go to the county and you people in the county by the way who've already a lot of bunch of banana boat people to take over your whole county and run the government and turn it into the ground turn into a piece of crap you're the ones who are responsible because every ten they say roll over you do like an obedient dog just like you're gonna do until i twenty nine in the middle of this bogus fixed election. They are tying up their their creating and buying 10th in the to read this thing here's somebody who faxes me this brochure that's being headed up by the end of the x you see mayor penis makes it sound like somehow the mimey did expressway authority has got nothing to do with him in the county like it like it's some kind of autonomous thing like they're not in bed together and yet the release from the mimey did expressway authorities talking about the toll increase and we can't waste any more time and we got to raise the money because we got gridlock etc. it says tolls are the only funding source mdfs authorized to use out of its charter and toll increases are needed by july 11th in order to avoid serious delay of this important rebuilding program does anybody believe that by july 11th not by july 30th like today after the election but by july 11th it was like it was life in death that they had to get this toll increase in there by a couple of days ago in order to make sure that they had two solid weeks to get everybody crazy so they would vote yes on i pennies sales tax and they still don't give a crap that's the best part they couldn't care less and of course you people are in business in date county you know that anybody with a brain it looks like from central date to north-brower or to south-brower they're not going to shop in date county to pay an extra one and a half percent sales tax they're not going to do it but don't confuse the public with the fact because they've already gotten together behind closed doors they made up their mind isn't what it's going to be and nobody cares i'm not you know something i'm not going to talk about it anymore i've already done my thing i got all whipped up to a friend the end of even live in fricken date county and here's another great reason why you know the girl i call yesterday was talking about if i caught up with guiding light you know that i keep what i was on vacation i said no and so she says oh there will be no problem and you go home today turn it on you didn't miss much you'll catch right up with it well i went home yesterday through your clock turned on CBS which i can only get channel four i can't get it on the big dish because the local affiliates don't want you to be able to get the out of time that we're affiliates and again what are they doing peppa peppa peppa what a goddamn cubins out there in the water in the coast guard 25 fricken minutes of the same bullcraft just like before i went away and vacation the same repetitious crap do i care about cubins out there in a godday am i do i care about that oh the most of the people in the Saudi it's give a flying crap about this oh oh what the the media here this this is a place even more than anywhere else in this in this very tightly controlled country this place here in south florida where the people are brainwashed and manipulated by the media and politicians the such a degree that it's hopeless it's hopeless baby you like that a prayer just come here and do like the old the old farce the kind of retire from life don't just retire from work retire from life maybe they got it right you know maybe they would have it down to a science just living their own little conclave and worry about their own little selfish things and their early bird dinners and what's in it for me and where's my social security j and that's it and just escape from all the rest of it because it's hopeless anyway the horses out of the barn and to watch these people in the behavior like i did suddenly come home from the airport and see and because there's you know so it's that it's 25 cents it's 50 cents okay that was a surprise to me but guess what it wasn't like the end of the world because if you drive it around out there and you don't have the extra 25 cents you shouldn't be driving the first place and yet to watch the way you people are carrying on and like all these lines in this guy this morning is BMW oh Jesus I don't care make it three cents a hundred I don't care what kind of sales tax you put it just to stop with this insanity let me say it again there was a toll booth they're already they just increased the toll everybody with a brain everybody with even a little teeny tiny one and a brain too should understand that by now and yet they're like doing car wheels out there and a road and they're switching one lane to another and oh what do I do and where do I go and uh just exactly as they knew you were going to do I mean you talk about obedient you talk about joust dipping in a line nice going I'm sure that mayor penis he's probably stroking himself right now he's so excited about here's a mobile in Miami hello oh yes what the phone to work well how do you like that the phone don't work we're going to have to reboot the phone system and start all over again because this is WCWM we're here we go you're doing the phone system stand by okay you'll have to call back in I guess if you run whole all three of you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line now don't get yourself worked up into a state okay you're feeling real good you had a great vacation you got some vinegar and whatever little bit energy speaking of that by the way I had a lot to Zanson biggest when he was on vacation last week he was on vacation same time as I was and I heard the first part of Hank show yesterday in boy sounded lucky must have had a really rough time out there because usually you come back from vacation you're loaded with energy and you're thank you so much five six seven oh that was mayor penis thank you mayor back to you five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the mobile one line here's a mobile in Davy hello more near the morning yes sir uh the only thing I had the same about that cult saying I think I'm just going to pull my car for the threatened to doubt my car was got to lay maybe I'll get mayor penis is attention my doubt it and uh I'll matter material okay great he's not a material okay nobody here cares anything to say about this I mean I realize that I'm surrounded by a lot of dumb people out there in this town but Jesus Christ how is it possible to be this indifferent how is it possible whatever you want okay whatever you want we'll go along with it just please let it just like how our bills said what you're got names field building radios in your pop up poster and your color TV and that's it just leave us alone we don't care what you do this is a place where they could come a knock on your door and pee on your front lawn and take a dump on your porch and you still the people are so what I'm not gonna say about it like I don't like like the first guy that was going to look like that he was that was that was the most accurate color of all right there I think as of today I think I should do myself a tremendous service and promise never ever to even get involved in any of these things again whether it's humans carrying on a block in the highways or it's corrupt politicians sticking their hand in your pocket again and screwing into about what what they're in this and making it not gonna change my life what the why the house should I care when I'm living in the air or 4 million people they don't give a crap about any of this stuff about anything nothing let me just go to that restaurant where the food isn't so good and where they tell me it's over price let me go and see you check that out and then after that I'll go see a ball game I'll go subsidize John Henry or some other billionaire help him up so I'm totally a chain you know this thing with a stadium they'll get a stadium wherever he wants to build it they'll get a stadium they'll find a way they'll push it through the rig it just like they're doing with this thing with the sales tax they'll do it they'll do whatever they want it's always been that way here because you people are oblivious and then of course we got a handful but that they don't do anything because the mobile in the world hello hey new yes sir you gotta keep it up you know why gotta keep what I'm talking to myself no but you gotta keep it up because one day they'll do you what they did

I've got to do the devil to tell me the truth. The time at how late he must be in pain. Just give rest in my bones. When you're doing why my wife won't leave me alone, we've talked to our wife and our never-weighmen. I just find a treason through tomorrow again. Oh, so I sit on a bench and they'll raise. When you think more that I'll only best to take me away. All you love just sit and I'll let you go. I put my face right. I'll take a time that's way beyond the entire space. And a few things. I'll let you go. No more muffins just go to the Zelle Bay Beach. I live by the muffin die by the muffin. It says in this morning's paper by Mix Lipka. This guy that ran gilded is there were selling these muffin. Like a lot of other places do by the way. Sugar free, factory, etc. On the ingredients and whatever they bake them, whether you find out, surprise, not sugar free. In fact, they were using, what is this stuff that they were using? Scoup and bake. Scoup and poop. They were using to make it. And a bond 85 was suffers from diabetes. It's so in a restaurant. It's on us for more than $15,000. Plaining to a consumed large quantities of the offending muffins. Since 1994, as a result suffering disability across a medical and nursing care. Because it was any too many of these goddamn muffins loaded with sugar. No more gilders in Del Rey Beach. Oh! 560, 560, 560 on a mobile one line. Here in the land where they just absolutely refused to care. Same crap yesterday, 25 minutes on Channel 4 on the CBS affiliate. Watching Cubans out there in a goddamn ocean. With the patchying around, screw it around with the Coast Guard. Highly at Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. You are absolutely correct sir on this sales tax pay. And keep pampering it. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Keep pampering it. I can't get a response. Nobody cares about this thing. Keep pampering my ass. Okay. Keep pampering it. Call the hammer until him to hammer it. Okay. You can wake him up. That was funny. Guy. What? I told him he must have had a bad time in Vegas. He. What? He never woke up once during that show yesterday. I mean, it's not the ritual as he wasn't close by here with an easily poking in the ribs. He just must have had a rough time, I guess. Sounded like it. 560, 560, 560, 560 on a mobile one. Yeah, keep pampering away for us. We have nothing to say about it. We got no opinions. We don't really care. But keep wasting your time and your energy. Be in the spokesman. Okay. I'm tired of being in the spokesman's winter's no response. All right. Like farting into a windstorm into a goddamn tunnel. What's the point? You don't even get an echo. Here's a mobile in the grove. Hello. First, I work in retail. High price picket items. Yes, sir. The spell fact is going to hurt me. Right. I mean, it's going to cut into my pocket. And I don't think that that's necessary. Second point is I just got back from a three week vacation up because I'm family house and Tennessee do some horseback riding. I drove through Atlanta. I didn't go through one single toll road. Yeah. I drove through Charlotte, North Carolina. I drove through all these roads. Not a single toll road. Why don't they just wrap your mission again. It's got the best expressway system in America. And you won't find one single toll road either until you get to the ambassador bridge. I mean, this is ridiculous. You can go 15 miles here without spending 15 dollars. I mean, I traveled everywhere and not a single road. I had to be paid for by toll. And this is interesting, though, that we can come up with always creative ways to finance stadiums and arenas for engineers. We can do that with taxes on tourists and so on. No problem at all. We can come up with a money to build a way in high ping a $200 million arena. They're in sunrise. But when it comes to coming up with a money to build the roads, we have to tax the poor bastards here who, you know, and again, how about the people that don't even use the roads? We're going to have to pay the increased sales tax. Exactly. And like I said, this is the sales tax. It's going to hurt. We're all these people in retail. They don't think this is going to hurt them. When you saw big ticket items. If you saw big ticket items that once that adds up a lot. And you know how many snores we got down here. Even if it doesn't add up a lot, people will spend $3 in gas just to go and buy it for like, you know, $1 cheaper in Broward County. Well, like I say, there's some people going to wake up and start thinking using their brain. Okay. Good luck, Pat. Have a good day. Bye. Yeah, this MDX piece of propaganda they're handing out from the expressway authority says, you know, you do have a choice. MDX wants you to know that there may be an alternative to the MDK tools on June 22nd. The Miami-Dade County Commission approved mayor of Piness's proposal for a county wide referendum for Thursday, July 29th. And if you go ahead and vote for that thing, we'll abolish all these tools and the world will not come to an end in the sky. We'll not fall, etc. And so on. So here, you know, the mayor wants to give the impression like the MDX is some kind of self-propelled authority that he's got no control over. We're not involved with. And yet this is a campaign that the two of them are running together. It's a blackmail campaign. They're threatening you. If you don't like what it is now, just wait, baby. We'll have a tool on every guy in the straight corner. We'll build another guy named Tulbooth in the story of your life. If you won't let loose and give us that penny sales tax, so we can do whatever it will help me want with it. And we can do the same kind of fraud that merits theirheim of supervised over here with the first metro, where we're election 20 years ago in that fraud. And I'm the only guy that impersonating the media in this town that's sitting here spewing my guts out. Like I said, I don't know why. Didn't do any good back then. It won't do any good now. Because I see these jerk balls, these asshole, these Johnny jerk off this morning sitting there, carrying on like the world is coming to an end because they can't figure out how to pay the 50 cent toll. Yeah, how do you do that? I guess somebody better show them how to feel the change. Here's a mobile in West Palm Beach, yellow. Hey, how are you doing? Okay, sir. I got a question on the satellite dish, where they're taking away the network feed. Yes. Yeah, they say you got to get the local stations at all. And that's fine, except like that's not fine. Well, I got, yeah, you're right. I got a big screen TV and the local feed sucks. Yeah. So now I'm losing this stuff and I say, I don't understand how the newspapers get around it. If there's a local newspaper, not regulated by the, by any government agency, the newspapers don't have an FCC, the newspapers do whatever they want. Exactly. You're right. They do exactly what they want. But it's the same kind of, you know, one's a print medium, the other one's electronic, but it's information and entertainment and advertisement. So if I get the Palm Beach post or the Sun Sentinel locally, how come I can also get the New York Times as a Chicago Tribunal? One of those? Sir, let me, what did I just get you saying to you? The print media have no government regulating agency. There's nobody to tell them where they can distribute or what they can do, because it's called freedom. You have the freedom to buy any publication you want. Just like you should have the freedom to watch anything over the year that you want. Especially if you're willing to pay for it, like the network of probably a traumatic town. But instead what we have is on the 30th of June, we had an all-remove from our big satellite dishes. And we're forced to watch local affiliates, which, as you say, you have a very gritty subpar picture in many cases. And after an addition to which, they just pick and choose when they're going to pre-apolog our network programming for like long-term superiority at the time. Like whenever there's a goddamn Cuban within between here in the 90 miles to Cuba, in the water, we're going to have to go away for half an hour. Exactly. And that sucks. You're damn right, it sucks. And, you know, I said a lot of the ordinary people. The ordinary people, I'm up until June 30th, it's about a gotten home yesterday and had that crap on channel 4. I would have just turned over to WSEE there on the satellite and watched it on the big addition, said screw channel 4. I don't give a crap about anymore this banana boat crap. Exactly. Or if you have a life and you're not doing something and you missed something you want to watch it. You know, eight o'clock, you could pick it up at 11 on the west coast. Right. Right. And now you're screwed because you have the right to, and I agree, you should have the right to buy any newspaper you want. And you should have the right to pick any people. That's right. You're damn right. I don't know what else to do. I sent the letters to Congress. Well, I'm not opening your wheels, man. Welcome to America where we never met them in an apoly we didn't like. Better just grab our damn passport. Okay, pal. Good luck. Thanks, buddy. Oh, 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Do they care? No. Are they ever going to care? No. They're going to get motivated. Oh, they're going to get pissed off. Oh, no. No. No. See, when they were the Cubans blocking the roads here a couple of weeks ago, then everybody was psychotic and they well should have been. Then they were forming at the mouth because that involved the usual old ethnic psychosis. But here we got the roads all blocked off and everybody's having an oversparked on because you've got a political scan being pulled off right in front of your eyes. And nobody gives a crap. Nobody's got anything to say about it. Back then, they sure had plenty to say about it. We could have done like a five weeks seminar on psychosis. Back when the Cubans were blocking off the roads because they didn't get their way just the way they were. They wanted it with a goddamn coast guard. You people, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to write now. You've got nobody to blame but yourselves. Those of you in date County. You've got nobody to blame. Because you've sat back. You've allowed a segment of the community to run a whole goddamn thing. And you just walk around in La La La. Yeah. That's your thing. It's a toilet. Hi, a nail. This is sunny with the word of the day. We're here for a good time. Not a long time. Yeah, especially in your case. Oh, God, Leo. Me, it's just stand by and steam for sofaking. You understand? Where everything is out to the high sofaking standards. The selection isn't just huge.

It's the middle of the summer time. The people would have brought in their all-out time to run vacations. So what am I getting excited about? So same old crappy Bennoot. You know, after 23 years you'd like to think that sometimes some more long-th line. Maybe you made a little bit of difference. You said something. You did something. Is it possible here? No. So just take the money and keep making a lot more of noise, kills and time. Calendale. And deal. I really can't come in on the MDX. I don't go down to date. Counting without a police escort. There's a human blockade they attempted to save Lewis yesterday. I know. Probably resulted in that asshole that called us from St. Louis yesterday. Well, perhaps probably protesting his Edward behavior. But the difference is there, they arrested 200 demonstrators. Uh-huh. Mostly black, I believe. Well, putting Reverend Al Sharp to right. And Neil, if you haven't noticed the resemblance between Chip Bush and that. Okay, 560, 560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. Here's Miami. Hello, I can see this is going to be a short effort today. Miami. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Go on, Neil. Yeah. Yeah. Meaning what? Uh-huh. Meaning what? Meaning what? You got any material? No, you got no material. You just another asshole. Okay, get back out of an animal. All right, pal. Well, pack your maybe a note, Jay. And a Cuban bullet. 560, pound 560 on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile in a derail. Hello. Hey, Neil. What's going on? Not a damn thing, pal. Same old, brother. Yeah. You can almost smell it. Well, I'm pretty pissed off in part of about this penny tax. Yeah, I will know about it. Nobody cares. If you people need to realize it's going to affect every single person in the bank County, this penny tax. If you calculated, it's a penny per dollar that you waste in everything that you buy. So it's going to cost a lot more to everyone, this penny tax than the 25 cents extra that you will be paying. Did you see this mayor yesterday on TV with his little chart showing how much of toll in the race, like by the year 2002, and in 2010 it'll be like up a dollar. And in 2020 it's going to be up a dollar. Yeah, I'm sure everybody here is really concerned about 2020. I'm sure we're worried about that. Right. But minimum wage will probably be about $1500 an hour anyway. Yeah. But I'm voting no. My girlfriend's voting no. Her sister's voting no. Her mother's voting no. No, no, no. Thank you, Neil. No, no, no. No. Vote early and often pal. I'm going to vote for the $300 a piece at least. 560, 505, 60, 50, 60 on a mobile one line. Here's a lady mobile and a lot of day of lakes. Hello, Neil. Yes, man. I just wanted to let you know my family and I had just gotten back from Europe. And it's amazing how in Switzerland in a city like Basel, people can just hop on and off public transportation. You don't have to wait, not even maybe a minute to you can get all over the city. Right. Wonderful, Rose. And I don't see anybody paying tolls about anything. And we pay my husband has practically half his pay tax taken away from the by the government for supposedly rose schooling and all of this business. And yet when you stop and think about it, what we have the worst school system. I think we're worth the Mississippi now. We have horrible roads. They're constantly patching and unpatching them. And we have to pay through the nose for them. Now, I don't live in day county, but I'm fumed every time I have to go there and stop, you know, every five seconds along the way to pay to use these substandard roads. And I think people ought to really thank cards. The better than I'm not going to. You can sit here and pacificate and say what they ought to do and what they ought to think. They don't care. They don't care. I'm sitting here today doing my usual begging for phone call routines. And I would have thought while I sat down here this morning, even mentioned this again, that the people would have been up at arms. But they don't care. All they do, all they want to do is hate each other. That's all they know about. So if it has an ethnic flavor to it, then they get whipped up into a frenzy about it. But if it has to do with things that affect all of us, they don't care. And it's really so ludicrous because when you go to other places and you see how many people from all over the place live in all these cities. Get along and really get upset about the things that are common to everybody. As you say, education. Well, when I go to your final where I would never dream of running a car or using a car, you have every kind of transportation. You've got the trims and buses and you subways you name it. It's amazing. But even even if you use my husband and I did rent a car, it was wonderful. So all over the expressways never had a problem. There are all kinds of gas stations, food where you go, don't forget real food when you pull off on the expressways that a plastic stuff. It was amazing. And why is it that we have such a problem down here? And it wasn't any better before we had all these ethnic. I mean, it's always been bad. It's always been bad. It's always been bad. You know, you're busy building a renaissance stadium suite. We don't have money for things like schools and roads. We don't have money for that. I guess not. We can be blackmailing the public and threatening them to to get the money. It almost sounds like. I have to take it to call you because it sounds like, okay, I'm sounding off. You're sounding off. And it's as you say. We just. We're just. We're just. We're just. We're just. We're just. We're just. We're just. We're just. But have this in this here. I can't take off and leave. Or a truck. Well, I don't know. I don't have any. I live in Broward County other than the turnpike. I don't pay a toll anywhere. So I'm not worried about it. Some. Yeah. How about Broward. We managed to survive without all the tools. Somehow, let's hope it stays that way. Thanks a lot. Okay. five six seven. five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line. Just keep blackmailing and threatening and put these little games together. And it works. That's why they do it because it works. And because every time they do it. The Harold joins in there and the rest of the media sits back like the. media sits back like they got the paulsy like they got the the cat's got their tongue and that's it and they just go ahead and do whatever the hell they want and you people sit back on your ass going like that yeah yeah oh my god i mean to see that scene with these people with a lines backed up oh my god 50 cents instead of a quarter what are we gonna do how to how we're gonna get through this thing here how does it work how can it be done haha oh man how can they find our service for 23 years and I'll keep saying it asking the same question how can they stick so many stupid people in the same place at the same time that's the question for the ages man where did they find them it's that a factory where they stand them all out all these people sitting there wondering uh and of course they get right up to the booth naturally got for bid that you know like sure to half a mile ahead get your change out or have some kind of concept I mean it only has big big green and blue signs up there to the head etc so on how much it is no no just pulling their an inch start to try to finger it out here's a leading coconut creek hello hi I just ended up calling the white house you can call the white house anybody can get the phone number as for from information yeah and explain that that we live down here and the president I didn't realize it's coming is not coming because of the Cuban situation or anything like that right but the bottom line is I would like to see the American flag flown once in a while down there I would think you the next time they've been okay great everybody call the white house and tell me why I'm seeing American flag flown down there okay wherever down there is woo see what I'm saying that's what gets them whipped up let's start with the Cubans again let's start with the ethnic business let's start with all that crap all over it come on here we go that's it he put up that'll get them worked up all the same people like that bitch called the White House to tell them that you'd like to see a Cuban flag stuck down here stick this honey five six seven oh five sixty pound five

you really you know other than Eminem okay I'm making exception there which we have to f*** every other word that he says anyway because he's a little on the six eye don't I'm saying like my anus here is uh I don't mean my anus is on the six eye now yet here's a mobile in Miami hello yes sir are you doing man great uh I I I live in Miami and the problem with a lot of these elections in Miami is only let the city of Miami vote on them and I was in here my anus is a county white county white right here in the county election which it should be defeated easily because most people in the county should realize that 25 cents would be much better than another penny sales tax but most of that's like the Miami issues it's a vote on such a small percentage of the actual you know what you consider Miami you got to consider candle and you know the cables and all the other areas and they don't get to vote on it so it really what was that have to do with this I'm just kidding you just got to sing it's a county white election right right I the county wanted that being held in the middle of the summertime when at least 50 percent of the people over the county are out of town well that that's a political thing that they've rigged and of course they're gonna try to you know which is a joke because the mayor is a joke and he tries to make it seem like a his way with the penny tax would be easier you know what it costs $3 to get some Manhattan it got you know it costs money to drive sometimes and that's all you have to you know 50 cents if you don't have 50 cents to pay for a toll you shouldn't be driving parking didn't offer the road that's right I mean you know it's real simple but the whole city of Miami as long as we have the same politicians running the city of Miami it'll never change and you know there's a bigger the city grows with the more people that come into the city the harder it gets for anything to change it doesn't seem like it can change anything okay I'll see you in brown yeah 560560 pound 560 I'm so depressed I'm so sorry that I came back here I can't be getting there are no words for me to describe how depressed I am that I came back to this place where the people are so goddamn indifferent so uninvolved so asleep so lethargic so pathetic there'll be a haveness like I said these people out there and a row with this backed up a mile because there's been a 25 cent increase and putting on a show just exactly what the politicians predicted and hoped for and prayed if they would have written the script you couldn't have acted out better for them including that jackass they had on channel for news this morning so I hope they charge you 80% sales tax and everything you buy okay just because you're such a jackass yeah I don't care one of

watching tv for a couple of minutes and i see they had the hits for the tom like this radio show i come here on the other side of it to the show there a lot of people because i worked for a bunch of cheap bastards here who don't promote this station and don't promote their show and it's in miracle they have any audience because i work for cheap bastards called the beesleys and Greg read who's

love you kneel thank you sir okay there it is a little salt in the ruins i mean his intentions are good but he doesn't the recingo one or except the fact that i work for cheap bricks who don't want to spend any money to promote us because uh... you know somehow we still managed to follow our way through without it and they load up the law with eight million spots in uh... then they got to give all the money to john Henry and the wane and it's just a vicious cycle here but in the meantime like hanks is just take the money like guilty says like everybody around here says if they've been here long enough just take the money in run and they're right they're absolutely right because otherwise you could go nuts you can have a nervous breakdown from these people they absolutely refusely inability to just uh... you know don't want to have anything to do with the way this business is supposed to be conducted and they want to stick it up the butt all the time nevertheless some people around here might like that here's a lady in my and he hello yes man can't hear it all okay i think the reason i think probably have a had got much responsible people concerned about the penny sales prices that

county as well yeah and unfortunately it's it's finished a county history yep yep yep right all right my thanks now she's right very succinct right to the point he's absolutely right by the way before forget about it yesterday was mentioning the newsweek magazine July 12th and probably some people went out of the news stand and they thought what is he talking about is god dead on a front page article because yesterday in a mail at home i get my July 12th issue of newsweek the u.s. edition at the european one that i bought uh... where the house was in an answer them at the airport and low and behold on the front cover of the uh... one here latin u.s.a. article i was talking about with bill draconair and uh... our loud mallet bullcraft was really obnoxious repugnant unacceptable articles that's the front page story now the thing about is god dead in western european sure can look that way in all those statistics and the other stuff that i read is that story in here at all no is there any mention no is it uh... no how do you like that so you see in europe and newsweek they can handle this they can handle the fact and they can deal with it because they realize that it's all a bunch of bullcraft but the american public were so brainwashing with the religion in horsecraft they got ahead this uh... garbage on the front page with billed wreck talking out loud good show there bill that was great here's a mobile in mianny hello and uh... okay sir uh... listen i found out the no against the uh... fail facts uh... the couple of different yeah and uh... think that's like the

would mean every lane is a sun pass lane how can they do that they do that we might have a uh... big enough to find over the line that they except on past you know for everybody even the people with don't have some task can get in those lanes so it's not a uh... i thought it was your sand on the thirty six there are no exclusive some past lanes you got it baby brilliant thanks for the good news hey all that to it doesn't matter if they take out these five and there's another five years from now traffic is going to double ten years than a double dozen matter yeah well get well but no what

But you know what? I don't spend tax time number one. I should have sleeping brown for safety purposes. And when I'm in a hotel down here, for nine years, I've listened to you on Mondays and Tuesdays. And now we're going to do this. It's only going to benefit me, but I don't spend any money in date counting. So, you know, what an answer on move. It's absolutely unbelievable. And just for the record, the troopers are in on it now. It's been up in 95. So, you guys are running drugs. You may want to get on US1 before you get to the border on ZX-85. Okay. Thank you.

I love Howard. Now I live in Fort Myers and there's some stability out here. People are nice. I think the word you're looking for though is boring. I mean, it's pretty boring here. I can't even imagine how boring it's got to be there. I just, I probably got some nice stookey's there. You know, along I 75 and some of those exits. They probably got a nice stookey. I guess they're on the beach, even downtown Fort Myers. They have all their, they're good to have. No. No. No. Go on late night. That's it. No. And the people here are getting younger. Yeah. They're under 70 now. Exactly. But you need an age is down to 69. That's the only thing that you'll find over there. But that's the median age. You know, the most frustrating part about this into your show now is that I have to get filled in on all this cube and the whole piece stuff going on. You know what? I don't care. I don't want to know about it. Believe me. Trust me. Hey, I got to go find a new Spag. Yes, sir. Let me. You're Cuban. Yeah, my amy. And I love my dad. Okay. 5, 6, 7.

But today, my God, to come in here and actually, you got to pinch yourself every now and then make, make you understand that you're awake in a life. Maybe that's what I needed yesterday. Here's Miami. Hello. Hi, near, good morning. Yes, sir. You know, I was in Cuba recently. And they listened to you there in 5, 60 and in 770. Yeah. 770 has a problem before you, that, I mean, if you ever wanted not to, not to foul somebody, that's the problem. Really? Oh, my God. God. Oh, God. He got a guide that his old problem for three days was about the fight that he had with his wife on his right through the matter of the house. And he called his wife in the job. And she said, I want to tell you. I don't know. I know the carried Rick Rally on 770. No, no, no. He says, it's one of the local jocals. Oh, I see. Really, really. Listen, channel. At least it wasn't done. I'm as talking about his brother Fred on the year. No, it wasn't. How was that man still on the year? It just astonishes me. Report from channel 23, Aniliana Rose Latina. She is demanding from the Coast Guard to return to Miami. The body, the corpse of the lady that drowned over the weekend. What's wrong? She's going to do it. Well, they wanted to set up a big show if they gave him to him. Even though the family of this young woman isn't pure, but her husband and son. When did they turn the body over to the time green show on MTV? Oh, so she's made them come up with some pretty creative things. He was demanding that. And today, if I were broke, they're going to have a picket in. They said, again, it's built Clinton on the entrance to Boko Plum. Yes. Come on, it's for embracing. And may your panel, that's going to be there. Uh-huh. Senorita Penellus. May your panel be there. May your panel be there. May your panel be there. Right. So maybe OGL be there at the same time. The Boko Plum. That would be good combination. Maybe OGL would be there with his big night. Good. Okay. Thanks. Not that we made anything by that Mr. Mayor. But you got to watch your backside in order to say that. Yeah. Oh, boy. Just I can't see. I can't deal with it anymore. It's too much of the same. That's why we all moved out of date. Okay. If you live in date, don't take it personally unless you want to. We just can't stand it. Okay. If that's your idea of the way you want to live. Fine. It's a free country to appoint. Yeah. That's what you want to find. We don't want any part of it. That's a good add. That's good. Down in the Falls County mountains. Somewhere in Charlottesville Forest Small Bay. Around there are around two in the midst of it. Yeah.�wsa cig� oyster. Babney's growing sand. Big bucks. The Atomic. Rぶ. He said that you said it. City of arms. Ouss. No? They're supposed to. Oh, they don't. Oh, man. If they have brought it, if they have brought worse than my public, they must be hiding in the place to just make sure I can't find it. I'm going in there again this afternoon. I'm going to turn that store upside down looking for brots. Yeah, but ask for jobs and looking for crowds. Those are the real Wisconsin brots. Okay. Okay, and closing. Mirkiness, your an asshole. Thank you. What did you say? He's an asshole. 560, 550, 560, 560, on the AT&T line. Don't forget, just vote. No. Mirkiness, my good close friend, Raul from Hylia. He's coming out against the penny sales tax today. Always love that raw martines. You know what I'm saying? There's a hell of a guy. You don't mess with him. That was from. Yeah. Don't muck you around with him at all. 567, oh, if you don't, you don't mess with a falconer. You get the claw. There's a word that goes in there, but you know what it is. Huh? Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. So, you? Yes? Yeah. Can we just vote? No, on both things, the quarter-end of penny? The quarter's not on the ballot. Oh. Either give him, even the give him the penny or he's going to give you the shaft. That's the way it works. Come in. It's like, pick your poison, you know. No, he's not easy. See, they're your, yeah, sure. No. That's it. Okay, we're closing a merrikinalist, if you're all the cool. Okay. Okay. Oh, back home. 567 was something about that he's got nice brown eyes. He said, 567, 0560 and pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Never looked into his eyes to be honest with you. He looks kind of out of peeling to me to be very, very level with it. He just, boring. But he's young and he's different and he's fiber, he's the same old crap. Okay, he's own lock stock and barrel. And his whole deal here, merits their on. It's got the same rotten smell that it always has in his town and always will. The stamp of the Harold right, even though they moved out of town, I read her, there's still here screw and things up. Here's a mobile informa, Waterdale, hello. Yes, sir. And you want to talk about, you know, you say the fixed election already. But right now, they're probably messing with the polls. Mixing things up, making it so complicated for people to get through there that people are just going to want to vote, yes, to this whole thing. And exactly, that's what this whole thing is about. In fact, you know, you raise a point. They probably have instructed the toll takers and I don't want to confuse with my good friends on the turnpike that toll takers because they're very nice people, most of them. But the people on those toll roads they're in their county, they probably instructed them to be as inept and incompetent as possible to make sure that this is the biggest disruption these people's lives so that they'll get sucked into voting. And I got them penny sales tax. That's exactly it. They fixed them in election. We don't even know it. Right. Thank you. Okay. Vote early and off. I'm not going to talk about it anymore, but no. Vote no. I will not talk about it again until tomorrow. But what? I mean, the election is like two weeks from the day after tomorrow. It's 16 days away July 29th. The day the CEO is spring book comes out. And if we can only rig the guy damn numbers in the book, the same way they're going to rig the selection we'd be in good shape. We'd have a 30 share. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes. Neil? Speaking. Good afternoon. How are you? Long time listener for a time call. Yes, sir. Okay. I'm sorry. I didn't even agree. Did you consider a thin Dutch meat? Yeah. I asked the words about that. Would the assume that pen Dutch meats would have brought worse? You would think, since they have all these other kinds of, every other kind of meat that's ever been invented? Oh, okay. Well, I thought maybe you might want to try and have a since you've already considered a. Well, I mean, I thought about it, but I just don't know for sure that they carry broad words that they have the real thing. Oh, I've considered it. Okay. All right. Well, maybe may want to pursue that. And I hope that you find what you're looking for. Okay. Thanks. Me too. I hope I find the right meat. Always looking for the right meat, baby, because that's what life is all about. Just getting your hands on the right meat and then making sure it's prepared correctly. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. Second your teeth into it. And pound five, 60 on the AT&T. Wireless line. Yeah. All new kids out there under the age of 17. You better not be going in and seeing those are rated movies, because then Bubba's going to get really pissed off. And god, all I know is where he'll stick that cigar next. Maybe in somebody's spectrum, if they're not looking out and by the way, we sure hope that wherever he sticks it, it's one of the great cigars. What a segue in the Alliance right, because we love Nick's and Nick loves this show so much. In fact, that asshole and St. Louis, by the way, why did you send a letter to Nick's? They've only had 6,000 letters from assholes like you and Nick still loves us. Here's his face, there's a child. He's seen their early life, but they're obsession with the disgrace.

Short, Jesus' star, on an old year when he are and if you think down to jail, it's that's okay. Don't just be sorry, Henri, do you think he Martin knew he might just lose a lot of science? Yeah. Because it's getting started, Henri, do you think he Martin? I'm not saying you'll be really less of a man. You don't get this garden on Ricky, Ricky Martin. I don't care how much that he made. You're letting it begin with starting on Ricky, Ricky Martin. I'm not just going to go over here, the plate. What do you see, it's a plate? That damn sack, I can't stand it.

Here's a mobile and time or time to look. Hey, how are you doing Neil? Great. Hey, good. Stop that. I didn't just get back to make us as Chules. We've got to wait there for a second. What an awesome place. Yes, it is. Off and off and off. There wouldn't want it to be like that here. What would we sure to have all those great, smiling people, young living and breathing people having a great time, spending all their hard earned money. We sure don't want that here to do it. George, it was the heat. The second day right there was 120 degrees. What? Those sweat. Because you're in sign all the time. Well, no, we were outside. I was with a family and everything. You know, I don't know how to explain. I mean, I take the club a child here and I'm what year to 85 degrees. But, you know, 120 out there. Don't feel like more than 115. You're right. Okay, listen, get the new phone pounds. That hit a great time. Yeah, we don't want anything like that here. See where prisoners. Okay, where prisoners. There's nothing we can do about it.

You never used them? I mean, don't feel bad. I appreciate it. But I just never, no, I know that thing of going into ketosis. No, well, that's good. I'm glad to hear you had a good trip.

pal we got all these call coming in here like one and two at a time five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on a mobile one line it's I I don't get it I don't understand it I'll go to the course the fact that most of the people live here got nothing to say you've started talking to somebody in a super market or like anywhere they got nothing to say go to a ball game you ever tried to talk to somebody that's sitting behind you and there's no idea of what's going on in the game whatever the event might be especially the hockey game they're all sitting there going talk about stuff totally

reason I sure let me ask you this what what was the reason you think that he changed he did that question about face on that Mickey Harrison deal with that arena after we got elected largely in part of the promise that he wasn't going to do the deal perhaps you know the people were building huh perhaps his buddies of the people building that's right perhaps somebody's getting smeared somewhere along the way okay because anywhere you got a politician that's this anxious to pull off this kind of a scam and do it as transparently it is reasonably as he is doing then there must be something more than meets the eye the key to the point is that every time merits dear home comes back to be the manager here we get more metro real even if you know even though the first one was a boom dog on a waste of a billion dollars every time he comes back here we get more of the same okay thanks oh where are they putting him building this I'm building what to the metro extension like what what they

great thing that they raised the tolls right before this election because now the people are nice and pissed off and fired up good luck and getting a past no I think you're wrong I think that that's

Okay, another full question today, Who's got the better answer? Jennifer Lopez, Brittany Spears, Or Olympic Viscuit, is our poll question today? 567, 0560, Pound 560 on the AT&T wireless line. You're a make a long story, sure, Kenny, the three of them sing what to ever know. No, but be that as it may. I'll tell you another group that I would mention this to you before, And you were like non-commitals, because you don't know who they are. 5, another one of those boy groups, and another one of those ripoff groups. 5, and another new song is like a rap song, Which they can't sing. It doesn't make any difference whether they're their rap at it or a crap at it, Because they can't sing with a crap anyway. 5. Is it on the scale of 500, that's about where their musical level is? And all of them, about that whole group, 5, I would say, And a scale of 2000. Just thought I mentioned on TRL, Backstreet Boys, 7 nights in a row, Backstreet Number 1, How come that girl from Gainesville, by the way, that end-sync bitch? How come that nice, so young lady, Never call this back from Florida, from FU? How come she never call this back? She was going back to summer school or something like that, And given me a big song to dance that I told her that the Backstreet Boys Would be Number 1, this is like ages ago, And sure enough by the end of that week, there was a planning end-sync, Which sucks. And it's still there, number 1 again, Last night on TRL, since now they're all watching the Tom Green Show, Watch an MTV 24 hours a day, And turning off these other goddamn channels. That's what I say, turn off all the other crap, Turn on MTV, and leave it on. Oh! Especially 30 nights at 10, 30, And Sunday afternoon at 3 or 4, whatever they decide to put on, Two Tom Green Show's back to back. Here's Plantation, hello. Plantation. You all how you doing? Pretty good, sir. All right. Yeah, I have two things I wanted to talk to you about. I heard you mentioned about the American Pie movie. Right. You gotta go see this movie. It's the funniest thing in the world. And the great thing about it is that I'm 19, I just graduated from high school last month. Right. And it doesn't crap around about what's really going around on in high school, You know, like sex is so easy to come by. Right. It's not, you know. All right, trust me. Unless you're one of these big dumb chops who is a footballer, Or put a ball through a hoop, you know, It's not that easy to come by, It's a fairly old guy. Let's go see it. It's very fun. I'm going to go see it tonight. All right. The other family thought he about was, you know, I traveled throughout, you know, United States. I went to, uh, you replaced here with my family and everything. And I've never seen any other state country, Panthers to an ethnic group like the Florida government, Raiders to these Cubans. That's absolutely correct. You know, they used to do whatever the hell they want And get away with it. Most people would be in jail if they're blocking traffic. You know, sitting in jail right now. Like they weren't saying Louis over the weekend. I tried pulling that crap there in a couple hundred of them went to jail. That's right. Being tormented by bubbling your jail cell. But then not the Cubans down here. Yeah. I them. Well, we got a foreign country. You know, Dave County has been taken over. And that's why most of the country. United States, you know, Hispanic make up what, uh, Maybe 4% of the voting population. Okay. And, uh, There's an article in the, Yeah, but they, they counted. They make a probably 94% of the voting population. Yeah. The old Cubans, they're only one to vote in big county. You know, I don't know what the validity behind this, uh, This article in the Sunset and it was a couple of weeks ago. They said that Al Gore was actually going to ask, uh, Mayor Pingu to be his running mate in 2000. Yeah. They're talking about it. I mean, you know what I say? I say, well, pack them up. Maybe you know, Chief. That's the way we have to get him out of here. I say, let's do it. And I'm thinking myself, go right ahead. And I'll go out and I'll vote for, uh, George Bush. And he's ugly. Plus two. Right. All right. Okay. Yeah. Let's, uh, I say the way. Let's, uh, just, right. We'll do right in. We'll have Tom Green. This is the choices. Tom Green, uh, Jesse the body of Intura. That's a good start. No more of these goddamn politicians. They're all the same. They're all about your crooks, baby. If not just to cliche, they're all about your crooks. They're all on a take. They're a pile of crap. You only got that isn't a crook. His goddamn tent entity. Because he's got all the money that and plus he's already killed one woman and, uh, done all the crap that he can do. Okay. We love all tent entity boys. He looking old by the way. Did you see him on there with Bubba this morning? They're doing his health care thing. Wow. That fast living tent. He's going to get to you sooner or later. And he also is, what does he weigh? About 240, 280, 130, 40. He looks like Spatboy in a bad day. So did we ever get any more of that? See, I was looking for the orbit on my good close friend Andy. Didn't see any orbit on that. Maybe that was, I don't know. Maybe it was just a hoax. I'm hoping for the best. I'm hoping that I was just, I would rather. I'd rather that's got a note saying, we just, uh, you know, played a little prank on you. And Andy's doing fine. Somebody would have called us say it was a hoax. By now. He's not alive. He's not coming back. He won't be at their first talking in this fall. Come on. No. Please tell me he'll be there. He died. Just say he'll be there. He won't be there. Here's your field, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. A couple things I haven't talked to you. Welcome back to war. Thank you so much. It's so great to be back. Yeah, I can imagine. I'm doing okay. Hey, you got me, Jones, and I was over in Klonjermany. A couple years back. And oh, God, those thoughts that you're right. You know where they have, you have the best, broadwars in the city, at least the ones that I had. Right at the train station. Really? Yes. Oh, God. And the train station, they got a whole bunch of little shops there, you know, little food shops and so on. And there were, you know, I tried a couple different places and there was one that was just sensational. Some of them are a little bit too greasy. All right. This one was just fantastic. But it was truly amazing. You'd walk along these little shops and little, they'd have a little grill at like a haphazard. Right. And then you would just smell that and you'd go in there for a snack. And that would be better when were you there? This was a few years ago and I don't know, I was in the summer time. I've never been in a city in my life where there were more beautiful people in the people in the people in Kalon Germany. You could just sit. They had that one big shopping mall street. It's called Hohe H. H. O. H. Okay. And it's like a closed shopping mall. There's very rich, you know, expensive shops in there of all kinds. And you just could sit there and people watch all day and just with your tongue down to your toenail. It's unbelievable. Seriously. You've been like a glove over there, I bet. Yes. Okay. That's one thing I was going to talk to you about another thing was that I had. I just I'm disgusted with all the way there allowing the humans to block the streets. And I've just never seen like they could have a protest that they want, but blocking the lives of people and dating people. Well, that's what I said. If you want to have a protest that the appropriate place in front of a building somewhere, but not to go out there and mess up people's lives and screw up the whole roadways for Christ. Absolutely unacceptable. And they should be ashamed because we rolled out the red carpet to help them. Yeah. How look what they're doing to us. Exactly. Spitting in our posts. And doing how loud, too. In closing up from my friend's remain that's healing up in Boca. Shameless requests. Nobody rips you back. Okay. Thanks for having me. Okay. It's 9 minutes after 1 at 5.60 WQM we're solving all the problems of the world here today. I think we'll have to clock them. We're going to go out and get some real good brought words. Smoke a little weed and then go see Merkin tied a night. That's good to me. Now that 19 year old young man had called a couple of calls to go to church. It's not all at least easy to get laid in the high school. How do you like that? See that was that big article I had the other day. What he's yesterday in the paper about the Broward kids and about this not as much sex or not as many sex or lack of it. That's not by choice. It's just they can't get as much as they used to. Not by choice. Okay. Because believe me. Trust me when I tell you. Okay. The one thing that they would tell you. I wanted it. You bet. They would tell you that. That doesn't necessarily mean you're going to get it. I wanted it. Yeah. I kept hearing that. By the way, we're going to see him again or not. I guess we won't see him no more. JC. We're not him when you had the first initial right. Oh, the other one. The other one. The other. Yeah. I don't know. Probably not. I've seen him around. You've seen him around where. Around here. Like in the afternoon. Long after you've gone home. Oh, he's playing hard to get. He didn't make it worth his while I guess. Well, guess what? I did a lot better over there. Didn't cost me a dime. Just like always. A lot better. I mean no problem. No conversation. No big song and a dance. No games. No a tease. No, you know. No hairy chest. No. No musk right chest. There was only on a plane. I was only Austin Powers on the Virgin Atlantic plane. New. Yeah. By the time I get through the next couple of minutes, she is going to have to pick every scab off that cute red, puss filled body of her. All right. No. Body. You better. And I. So I'm going crazy on this. Yes, because this has got to stop. You make me sick, Pat. You bitch. God. How is it possible to be so stupid, Pat? Nobody bless you. And I go to the door of the air. You idiot. You asshole. Baby. Well, sing this. You fat, slob. I'm going to take this cord and I'm going to shove it right up his hands. Okay. And I'm going to shove this thing so far up his butt. And he's going to be singing a different tune. I get through them. Only have a longer cord than his piece of crap. Look how short this thing is. You got 100 assholes running around this building. Making fine. Another one besides him. Or, you're not that big. Get it out of there. Go pull it. Corns somewhere. Go do something. Pull what in your case. A good question. Okay. God. Nobody. He's in. Don't start looking. Once again is always the blame fat old kneel for whatever you're upset about. The disgusting nauseating old clowns. Old crabby old fidget. Really? Don't repent you're going to spit hell by those. You're fucking scared. You're a little white open. You're going to spit hell by those. You're a little white open. You're a little white open. You're a little white open. You're a little white open. You're a little white open. There we go. Now we're cooking. What did I just get through talking about? It was old bag. We don't watch you, lady. Okay. Go get some knitting out. Go find some cross food puzzle. Okay. The redway killer. The mass murder. The serial killer has been capturing. Can't you miss it? And the obsober reports that they got that lady off the 595 over past there by 441. What else? What more could you want? Here's a boy. You oughta read this. I don't have time to read it on the air. This poor bastard was coming back on continental from Vegas through Houston. And what he went through? I mean, I could not. She's already blew my brains on and wasn't even my trip. Sorry about that, Ed. What of our listeners out there who made the bad bad mistake of flying continental airlines? Bad move, man. I'm sorry. Yeah, my good friend who comes to the hockey games all the time. The airline pilot said, pup, pup, pup. Yeah, he's a good guy. But he talks about pup, pup. He works for continental. So I shouldn't have said that. But 560, 50, 50. Hey, listen. I tell it the way it is. Okay. I'm not going to lie for anybody. I'm not going to get a lot of money for it. Which I don't. Five and even for these people here. Am I paying me enough to lie for this tonight? No way. Boy, they suck. 560, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50, 80, 80, 80, 60, 60, 80, 80, 80, 80, 80. You know, I'm debating on the way home with the right shit stop for brought worse. Or maybe like, I don't know. But in a split of basketball and robbing stuff. You know, the basketball robbing is a drive to one on 163 in North Daiden. What? Don't do it. No, I don't mean to ban in a split. I'm just talking about like a hot pot Sunday with nuts with cream and cherries. On, they taste the food they all have. You mean that? That's not that. That's not that. You mean like the one I had about three weeks ago? It'll be no better than that one. Oh, then it ought to be great. That's a good place. Basket robbing is drive through. It's like heaven. And the best part of it is it's only like a few blocks off the interchange there. At 160, 30. So you can drive from there like 30 seconds right on the turnpike. And you hold the Sunday like in one hand while you're paying the tool. How do you like that? All you ask holes you wind competent. That can't pay your 50 said toll in Dave County. I can drive through the turnpike tool thing there. At the Golden Glades, eating a hot pot Sunday for basketball robbing pay my 75 cents. No problem at all and zip right up the old Hershey highway back in the Brownard. No problem at all. It all fart like me. An old buddy that he fag like me. I can do that. And you people out there are sitting around fumbling forward. Fumbling forward and a goddamn change too. Shame on you. I think there are a bunch of actors out there. I think that's where he brought ringers in here. You know, most of the people are out of town right now. It's a middle of July. I think the mayor imported a bunch of ringers here. In fact, maybe all those illegal alien Cubans, they put them all in the car. And they're the ones that are playing all this baby crap by the tool boots, pretending the traffic's all backed up. We're on the mayor, Mayor Pinga. You're not fooling anybody. You piece of turd. Straight to jail. Here's for waterdale, huh? Fort Loderdale? Yeah, they'll. Yes, sir. Do me a favor. Do not go to Penn Dutch. Yeah. The place in Loderdale is just north of commercial and federal highways called Emily's. Yeah. The world's best. All they do is make homemade sauce. It's really. Yep. You walk into the mama pop operation. Emily knows her meat, huh? Oh, it's, it's just unguided. It's the best without a doubt. Do not go to Penn Dutch. It's very, if once you go there, you'll freak out. Okay. All right. I'll go see Emily. Like, thanks. Yeah. In fact, that's the second person that I'd say do not go to someplace. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound, 5, 60 on the AT&T wireless line. That's where it's at. Baby, Hank Goldberg's coming up at 2 o'clock today to cover all the heavy-duty sports news. Then about 2, 15, you know, getting the summary of your good stuff. What was nothing going on in sports? Okay. What can I tell you? It's just a really did time. The All Star game tonight is anybody care about that. Oh, we got 655 teams. You do realize, by the way, that teams like the Marlins that have been out of the Erase for like a lot for about two and a half months now. But they still got 70, some out almost 80 games to go. You do realize that, don't you? And like John Henry says, we stink. We don't respect anybody to show up. The team for at least a couple of years is going to be really grow test where it'll lose our ass. So why would you want to go? Why would any person in its right mind go when they tell you ahead of time? Like I said at the beginning of the show today. Like somebody standing on the front of his restaurant saying, the meat all spoiled. Okay. Our freezer unit went out during the night. All of our meat is rotten. You're going to get some horrendous disease. And everything we got in there is spoiled. It's going to taste like crap. We can't afford to lower the prices. So we're going to gouge you like crazy. But if you want to come in and all men, people are coming in. That's what it would be like. I don't understand these people. Talk about lifeless and coolest. Oh, yeah. Well, we got to take our kids through a ball game. Take them out to see American pie tonight instead. Okay. Take your five and ten and twelve year old kids to go see a really funny movie.

I had a lot of TV's playing in my player in the car. Which I had a few more. But he was the Tony Martin issue came up and, and, and, and, and, and, and, I think that's a great idea. He's a great player. If you say that to J.L. and Jimmy said, well, he's, It's only didn't have anything to do with the drug dealing end of it. So he's okay. So I guess you can be a money-longer and play with the dog. He just can't, he just can't feel drug. Yeah. He was just being a China. I mean, you know, he was just doing a laundry number. Right. That's right. And Neil and closing. Cool pie. Don't give me any more work. I'm shfifting out here. Okay. Thank you. He shfipped it over there. Yeah, Tony Martin. You know, look good Chinese. But nevertheless, maybe he's turning Japanese. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, and that's the only reason that song is popular, because they just keep saying, Stick it up your ass over and over again. You know, and there's certain songs like that. Well, they say nokey a lot. I think that's the only thing that's going to be there. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Oh wait, you guys live in a different planet? Yes we do. I'm available. We live on Uranus. Just interesting to note though that the more the wheels come off the your government, the more entertaining it's for us. Exactly. Good work. God bless you sir. I'd say how to ban angrily. You bet. Okay. Well I'm talking one thing that lunch started to work. I'd like to force eat and says, working my way back through you. Remember that song? That's what it's doing right now. Thank you so much by the way. Chuck for interrupting a very busy day. He's a hell of a guy. Chuck over to Subcenter. He's been real good to us. So I'll tell you that. Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach. Hello. Mobile and West Palm. 26 minutes and 29 seconds and they're gone and we were paying for it. That's the bitch of the whole deal there. 560 560 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Here's my NELO. Hey NELO. How are you doing? Okay sir. I just want to let you know. There's some of this out here. Pistol. I've fired up about this. I'll say I'll stack. Oh you're the one huh? Yeah I'm the one. I don't have a problem with that. But when a guy's filling up his boat and his car to go fishing and putting it on a city gas car or you look at the port scambles. They advertised 136 about how the airport is. The third busiest in the world in the port of Miami is one of the busiest ports in the world. And they can't make any money. And there's not a problem. Yeah. You know what I'm on the flight. And the best part of the whole deal is that as you know, the county and city government are in bed as is the hero of the Mickey Harrison. And most of the money that he makes not a penny of a ghost to the county or the US government or anybody else because it's all registered the other country. So all this year. Yeah but you know, I think it's just simplistic as saying if we had a real newspaper who did some investigating and stopped all the crap. But we never will. Well I don't have it. I think it really starts there. And nobody's looking out for it. You get more information out of the new times reading an article about corruption and data and then you will in the air. Right. And it's just I didn't move the ground. But you know, I do work in date and I run a business here. But I just said I grew up here all my life. And I'm only 33 years old and I eat this sound like an old man. But I say, you know what, just down you should be great. I used to live in Westchester moved out the candle. It was a great town. You know, it's sad. Go down drive. You haven't driven down a street in a while. Oh my god. It's over. And you know, people. Oh, it's really bad. And it's just it's not getting any better. And people. How much can people spend? When's enough enough? You know, it's just simply. When is enough enough? I'll see you on county line road. Yeah. 10 till 2 at 560 WQM 560. We got one guy there. It's pistol fired up. Thank God for that. Don't forget, just say, tell all your friends. No. Don't roll you off. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Okay. Just like Lintick. Biscuit would say. Even the name of the group. You know, Lint biscuit. And then what is that? Tell you how bad, how really and truly bad. And George likes that. Doesn't that tell you everything you didn't know about his music about your taste? awful. You like that toy box. Yeah. Well, you know something. If you saw this video, you, you, I mean, it's a novelty record. Okay. They've even done a remake of the witch doctor. Not toy box. It's some other group. It's only. Exactly. Yeah. I'm going to bring that into tomorrow. If we don't get a lot of calls tomorrow, I'm playing the guy damn witch doctor. Oh, e. Oh, ah. David's a filter and over in his grave. I like that toy box. I hate to break the news to you, but Europe is so far ahead of us. Not just the music, but of course, and everything. But newsically, I mean, you're like light years ahead. Like Aqua. Aqua was big here, which, and that was also, I'm not saying that was a good record. Barbie doll, but it was cute. It was a novelty record. And the video was good. It was well done. Well, this is similar almost exactly the same, but better. And Lenin Marlin, you're telling me you didn't like you loved Lenin, but even as eyeballs were rolling, but he didn't want to admit it because I'm the one that I brought it in. And he'd be admitting that maybe my taste wasn't as bad as he usually claims that it is. Plus, the back street boys are just tearing him up all over the goddamn world. I mean, just.
