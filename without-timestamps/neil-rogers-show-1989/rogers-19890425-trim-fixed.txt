Why is that a chance to do it in a long time? I know. I mean, call a race on here. Birdie's melody with Betty Green. Do you know his name has been a green steam? And he changed it to Betty Green for racing purposes. And of course, racing purposes is kind of difficult because it's hard to see him under the water. And in the night race, I'm picking, how could you go wrong with this, doing this show? Yeah. Ask me a question. With Julio Pazura, I just love that name. Ask me a question. That would be a good name for this show. Yeah. Ask me a question. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, look at that hairy trotic train's at horse. So he's got a shot. He's four to one in the morning line. And that's my. That's it. So anyway, what was I saying about horses? Boy, he asked him anything. You're supposed to be keeping track. I got side railed there because I gave our pigs. But what led me into what I said, something about horses? Well, let's see. Green part of it. And talking about management. And then I said horses and horses, asses. And it all kind of like fit together in there. So I want to apologize to Dennis, who called me from hot one or five this morning. And I said Dennis, the menace. I guess. And that's recent. I told Sandy put it through to Gary Briss's office. I went back there and waited five minutes. Nothing happened. I don't see a lot of calls on the board yet. I'm sorry. It's ratings today. Oh, sorry. So if you have anything you want to get in here, you better do it now. Because once we get into those numbers, you know that it's audio. The only people that care are the ones in a business. Because what Johnny Dark is here today too. OK. So like you say, so Liberty guest in the studio, Johnny Dark. And I want to make it clear, not to Johnny Dark from WMCA or WBAL. Oh, and he knows that. WNBC. There's a new movie in town. Johnny Darks in it. And WRKO. That Linda Blair movie. I'll have to look at the paper. See the name of it. And Johnny Darks. And always said, that Johnny Darks just turns my head around. Linda Blair movie. New Linda Blair. That's the first. Now, now I can't think of the name of it. I, you know, can you imagine a couple sitting at home and the guy says to his wife, honey, let's go see the new Linda Blair movie. Anyway, now, depending on what transpires today, I just mentioned this because once we get into those ratings, the show goes to Hannah Hambaskin. But all depending on what transpires today, tomorrow, I may have a show that'll make, remember last Thursday with the memo. It'll make that pale and a winch significance because there are things going on that are so, I told you some of it coming to work before the phone crapped out. Yeah. Just mind boggling things, okay? Shocking things. Yeah. But I don't want to get into any of it today, but tomorrow we may have a real barn burner for you on this show. Speaking of barn burners, I want to go by, we have some memos from the past here at the party. By the way, topic on the Steve Kane show today, sex surrogates, therapist, or prostitutes. Ooh, ooh. I think would be more right down to earth. Wouldn't it? Ah. Marilyn Volker. Now Marilyn Volker, it seems to me, is one of those feminists, you know what I'm saying? Yeah. That name ring several bells. No Marilyn Volker's like from the, oh, what the hell is that group? Yeah. I know, seriously, Marilyn Volker is like, for what's the age group in Broward County? I can't think of anything today. Is Marilyn Volker? She's with that. What does that have to do with sex surrogate? Oh, well, well, I guess kind of time. And the Reverend Rick Patterson, who, of course, is vehemently anti-sex or anything that has to do. I'll be honest with you, they use a piano in his church. He's so anti-organ that it's just not him. I just, that's just a little. A little play on words there, OK? And then look at Henry, Henry, he said, gee, dad, it was a warlet sur. Uh-huh. I heard about that zipping and flipping and all that other stuff that was going on. I'll tell you, hang around with Grandma, boom, long enough, and got only knows. And when you'll show to the world, anyway, the Bill McQuake show, this is September 3rd, 1987. These are guest listings from the past to WIOD. All right, let me do this. OK. Seriously, we've got three people under. Get them off. I want to see from all the people in the audience that don't want to hear about the ratings today. They're sick and tired of us wasting an entire show. Get them off of there now. Nick, cut it out. I want to see from everybody that's going to show on the phone. We don't usually do this, because this audience is not like the Wins and Zade audience. It's as they used to respond within seconds. Number, there's decimal points. Sorry. I'm talking about your kids. Four, five, five, the Broweline, Brett 6. Seven, look at the date. Look at the FOMB lines. Seven, they're flying. There's still a, oh, there you go. Eight. Now that took quite a while. And yeah. All right. Now all you pain in the ass people that want to eat. I'm going to show them. All right. Now all those people are wanting here. They're ratings immediately that are sitting on the edges of their seats. Now is the time for you people to call in. Let's, let's, there too. Yeah. Whoa. There's FOMB. Three. Oh. I wonder what that is in Boko. That must be SBR. Hope there goes FOMB. There goes one of Broward's five. It's about even six, seven. One more to go in Brett 8. There we go. It's about 25. They both suck. All right. Now. Okay. Now those of you who really don't give a good, finally, for their work. I think that's one of the line-year-old business. Let us do whatever we want to do. Okay. Let's see those. Let's buy. That was a win. Huh? Six. Yeah, they're doing whatever the hell you want. FOMB each didn't want us to do what we want to do because they, seven, they got a mind of their own. They're seven. Oh, but both. Oh, but no, POMB. Oh, Bob, POMB. Not live. Well, that's because everybody, J&O wants to. There it is. Eight. That was a little quicker than the other. Still not great. No. All right. One more category. Now, seriously. One more category. Now those of you out there who don't really care about any of it, one way or the other. Okay. Who are totally indifferent. All right. Let's see those people. Seriously. Let's see a little show on the phone. Oh, those people who just don't give a damn. All right. How about any. Oh, that's good. There's three, five. South Florida. Six. South Florida. All right. We still got a date and a bar to go. There's six. That'll be pulled in the same way. One in the day. Oh, yeah. I'm waiting. I think there might be somebody on there. I think the lights not flashing. Yeah, there's somebody on there. Oh, I'll let. Okay. Well, I'll. I'll. I'll. Okay. And that's the way we like it. Oh, God. Okay. The melting pot has got a new location. Fact Friday night. I'm going to be there again. Down and over on South Beach. Well, let's. Are you talking about it at 1450 Collins Avenue at the rhythm club. My name is each. Now the rhythm club is a rhythm and blues night club with live entertainment. And you can enjoy that delicious or gasmic fondue that you enjoyed at the other top of the Melody Pot locations right there on South Beach, no less. And we're going to be there. I don't know what time yet though. But be nice if Lynn Friday I should get on top of this. Let me guess. But that's the way it goes. So anyway, it's 1060Wild and here's some old memos. Well, the members do it. Talk schedule. Yeah. September 13th, 1987. The bill. All right. Wait a minute. I got one more here. Don't answer him, Nick. All right. Everybody who like Bill McQuay to come back and do this. Time tomorrow. From 10 to two. Let's see. You fakers on those phone lines right now. Get what it. Look at that. Nothing. Come on. Is that one? Wait a minute. There's one. Two, three, four. Six, seven. Seven. Palm Beach doesn't. Palm Beach is out to lunch. They don't know Bill McQuay from from. You're on. There's eight. Now that was faster than the earlier response. Okay. All right. Well, let's give everybody a chance here. Day while we're stalling for the numbers. Everybody. Now, come on out. Two more for Bill McQuay. Boy, you know what I'm about to say. I'm about to go. I'm about to go. Oh, my god. And just an incredible response. That must be the old Bill Smith audience going nuts. Yeah. All right. There's one more flashing in. Look at that two more. We can't stop him. We can't turn it on. Here's another one. Yeah. It's like killing answered a picnic. And I got news for you. Working here is no picnic. Okay. All right. All right. We got him finally cleared. Are they clear now? We're just a second. Yeah. No. Another hand. Watch it. Okay. All right. Now, everybody who'd like to see Paul Lyle come back tomorrow on Do102 on a permanent basis at WIOD. Three, four. Oh, yeah. Well, they're following. Wait till I read some of these guests. They may change their mind. Five, six. Six. So I guess the verdict is for Bill McQuay. Seven. They're not not too fast. The Bill McQuay show tend to know and proposed budget cuts for Dave County could mean no life cards on some of South Florida. Yeah. Because county commissioners are meeting today on this proposal. Joining Bill is morning in the studio. Life cards, Lieutenant Marshall Hale and Dave Batonfield. A good and timely booking it says. Oh, yeah. That's what it says. That's like radio at its best. Yeah. All right. Finding our. Yeah. So, Chris. Somebody ought to shine his head. Oh, that's our program director. Of course from Louisville. Our six year old program director. The one Bill McQuay, Dave County manager Sergio Parrera. Talks about the people visit. And the monumental effort underway to coordinate the events around it. Yeah, because they had such big crowds. Remember that they couldn't get anybody to show up. Also, feedback from Sergio on the life card. No. Now, isn't it interesting how they got into a filing. We'll think here you it was supposed to be dilemma. But they spelled it. The ELIMA Delima. Doesn't kind of like a little Hispanic interpretation. They're Delima. We might use that word now. I think it might replace like ponderous or something. And then we can start using it. Do you have a little Delima today? Delima. I like that. It's kind of like spanglish. Yeah. And all our friends south of my, the city of Miami. I guess south of North Miami. South of the Broward line. Can use that Delima. Sure, and looks like she has a little Delima today herself. You have a Delima. And then from one to two, well, maybe we can get somebody to cut it off for you, Sharon. Here are the confessions of a nun. The staff and on this don't forget it's September 3rd. It is not a promo for today. Although it might be might have its moments. Confessions of a nun on the bill. McQueen, Joe, no less from Elizabeth. Wpton. Hmm. Her stories of lesbianism within the content will shock you. A nun no more. Elizabeth comes clean. That's what it says on the bill McQueen. That's how the idea. Well, that. On WOD News Talk Radio 610. That's nothing. What you didn't write this. You weren't here then, right? What a pornographic thing this is. And it says Elizabeth ain't getting on. I'm just like, yeah. Steve, can you show now ladies and gentlemen, I think this is the ultimate to the 6 p.m. September 3rd, 1987. Michael Disisto, the assistant of school joined Steven the studio to talk about positive discipline and unique learning institute. Now we just happened in these just for my boss. So don't blame me. Talks to a schedule for Thursday, February 25th, 1988. The Paul Lyle show tend to known. Do we have the right to die? And I couldn't think of a better show to be asking the question. All right? The use of youth in Asia for mercy, killings is always a hot topic. It says, who used to write the sheet man. Somebody really just can carry it away. And today on the Paul Lyle show, Dr. Reed Richter at attorney Bob Break. Oh my god. Join him in the studio to debate the concept. Wow. And then the Steve Canesho on this date for boy 25th, 1988. The six want your child to become a super kid. Listen this afternoon. The Steve Canes is parenting expert Michael Disisto. Stop spy. Drop spy. I like that very informal to talk to discipline. And how you should do it. How much you should do it out to your child. Oh, Doug Young wrote this, huh? Yeah. You know Doug Young called me the other day. Off the air and he was going on a great length about how Lee is not stealing from him. Yeah. I said, boy, you're in a dream world, Doug. Get a life. Oh, I'm so late. Right. He was tinkling all over the phone. In fact, they had to put the phone in pain behind. Seriously, that's not a joke. Wait a minute. How 105 jog Dennis Reese says, where is he? He's going to hotline Dennis. Here I am. Here I am. Boy, you can't wait for those numbers, Canyon. I think it was like first off the receptionist to the people. Yeah, you do have too many people working. Yeah. Yeah. I can think of what it doesn't right now. Just me if I six people would get to you guys. Yeah. I told her were to put it when you're pretty important. Why, it's not always easy to get through Dennis. Would you come over and just hit her in the mouth as hard as you can? And then hit your wife and him off for me once. I'll tell you what. Both those are okay. I've got a great not the ratings. Obviously, you know, I think we're already for those. But the hot rumor is about 95 coming back. Oh, 90 months. We don't have to get you over there. Wait a minute. It's the truth. They have a brand new program director. He's been hired from Chicago. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Just a second. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. Just a second. Hold on, Dennis. This is a dumb roll. A down day. Didn't I tell you that the days were on a day. The days were numbered. They have a new. All right. Just a second. Here we go. This can't be. Whoo. Here we go. Now it's going to be the arm military disco morning show. Oh. Oh. Oh, my. Oh, my. What are they supposed to be? A dance urban format. Oh, no, this junkies. Kind of like just having bored us. No disco. No. Not stopping. Mixing. Oh. Yeah. So you know all those things. I'm just going to be tuning out of you now. Neil. Yeah. What happened to the hot song, guys? That's the death now. Dennis, what happened to Rose? I think I don't. I'm sure that they're going to probably like ease these people out. But if they have an urge, they're like the stupidest. Yeah, that's your radio story. When and out, ease them out. Yeah. No guns? No guns, sir. How the hell can this community go out of those student-led lips, huh? Well, I guess it's just going to go like football and I'm sure whatever. Maybe they'll all be offered a chance to stay for $5 a mile. Yeah, but they're going to bring you over to record. I. Ninety five. Because nobody said it like you did boy. Well, you know what? Maybe Willie B. And Willie B. And Willie B. Oh, well, well, well, yeah. And I. And I. And I. And I. You think of anybody to do I. Ninety five. But he dies. We. This is hysterical. Yeah. We call him the I man. Maybe. Wait a minute. The rumor has it that Kyle Isley is the runner. He's the runner. He's the runner. He's the runner. He's the runner. He's the runner. Exactly. Well, you know, Kyle's a ball of fire. Yeah. I like he. Yeah. Because we're sitting there. But thinking of like, we got to get somebody to confirm. So I want to keep that. I go. Keep your brother. I want to see you do. Well, listen, you guys are really doing it over there. Tell Keith. He's a genius in his own mind. And you're really doing it. He's super guy. He is. Listen, he's a great guy. Just work strange hours. That's all. He's really getting better. We're getting out. He's buying. He sees and tickets. Really? Yes, sir. Yeah. Well, he ought to turn that team around. Anybody can do it. He can do it. He can do it. He's a deaf. Well, listen, if you can turn that station around. He can probably do that too. Well, listen, we're waiting with Bayed breath. Well, I guess he gives you the numbers, right? I'm going to head in right now to find out. I'll bed. Okay. Listen, just want to tell you. I'll see you later. Thanks for the info. Okay, man. Bye. Wow. That he got through. Wow. Good. Look. Can I do one? Why? Why? Why? Okay. There's all you kids out there. I'd like to be district. He's a call-up rose soldier now. Right? Just because all you got to do, you can't don't have to say anything. I was like, I'm not. That's all they got. If you want practice, go out on the highway, just read the sign. Oh, right. And it's great. And then they could get Ron say John over there. They could change your colors. W-A-O-A. Well, music. That'll be next. I'm making some Dennis Reese with some shocking news on ratings. They're here at it. You notice nothing. They're not interested in the least, but we got the most indifferent audience. Anyway, that's because all of people who are listening are in the business. They don't want to hear if their voice is recognized. Okay. 25 at W-A-O-D will be ready that we'll live in infamy in the anals of South Florida Broadcasting Ladies and gentlemen, shocking. Can you believe that? And you always hear these stories. Thank you so much. Yeah. Hi, 90-five. Wow. Wow, it's right. Yeah. Boy. Now, as soon as we get a station that'll adopt the Paul Meadow format. See, if you have a format that's named after a highway. Like, he won a I-95. The Dolphin format. Yeah. And he can have football and music. Well, we're kind of doing that now. Kind of like a football. Dolphin. We don't have the music. Well. I. Ninety-five. This is probably the music you'll be hearing. Now, what is that from the yard? What is that? Wait a minute. All right. Hello. Hi. How are you doing Neil? Who's this? I'm down here from the York. I worked for your former network. Really? Yeah. Good day. You were at the other station. Still, right now we got into some sort of argument on the air. We did. I get about what? About Paul Harvey being a douche-ter. About John. About John. You'll be in real name, I think. Oh, yeah. Well, something really heavy-do to do that. Yeah. You get up tight about that stuff. Pretty cool. So I'm calling to find out women how we can do. We're starting to read the ratings already. Well, they aren't in yet, okay? Here's another one of these pushy New Yorkers. Well, they're coming when they come in like any... Any women that we'd deraiding's already. We said, came to the right place. You guys should use the ice in higher barbers price. And to be on with Tom with the what's his name, Peter Jennings. So she got a nose for news, too. Is it okay if we wait till they come over the machine? No, he wants an hour. Paul, that you were the very first to get them. We are. We put him on the air immediately. Well, what's your vested interest in this? You want to hear those Paul Harvey numbers on WOLD? WOLD? But that's no idea. WNWS used to be the colors. We call them WOLD because they're audiences all over 100. The only station in America where we're going to turn it on Pollard and come spizzling through the radio. Not listening to a word that I'm good. I like it. I like it. No wonder I hung up on your last year, okay? You're another one of those pushing New York douchebags. So you don't work for ABC anymore, huh? No, I still work for him. Oh, you still work for him. That figures. Well, listen, it's too bad we don't have Paul Harvey anymore, but we don't have any more listeners over the age of 100, so we can't use him here. I see. Okay, Neil, I'm waiting with Baderdra. As soon as we get him out, you'll be the first one to know, okay? But you didn't answer my question. What's your scam and all of this? What are you looking for? Because then we get a radio junkie. Oh, are you? Yeah. Yeah, you sounded like you had a little problem. Okay, listen. It's great here. It's great here for me again. Give my best all those speakers up there at ABC, okay? Tell them we love their shows. Okay. Pushy New Yorker. Wow. Unbelievable. And he interrupted this. Yeah. Oh, you've been there. Oh, yeah. You've been there. Oh, yeah. And he didn't give a damn. So we got to Dolphin's and music ladies and gentlemen, on your Dolphin Expressway station for the ABC. Oh, yeah. Actually, we got a big billboard. It says pick up Mike, what's his name? Reneri. I'm just getting so shocked from that guy from ABC. Pick up Mike Reneri on the Dolphin Expressway with his thumb out, you know. We ripped it off from Dick Pertan. Anyway, it's 1031, a WID to phones are sizzling. We got at least three calls on it already. They don't care about it. They're all tuned sandy and already because they know we're going to do ratings in their board, crapless with that thing. They're on a here. He's got the bilingual proctologist. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And you know what he does, right? Yes. We got a lot of people in our audience who can be an asshole and he's their language. Kind of fits right in. Anyway, 1031 at WID. Let's give those numbers out. Let's see some life on his phone for crying out loud. It's ratings day. These are the things that we strive for in this business. They keep calling in. I keep hanging up on him. I know why you're putting him on hold, but it gives you something to do. Okay. He's got this extra hour. Oh, my any mayoral candidate, what we just hung up on him. And we hung up on a one in Hollywood. Merrill candidate. Yeah. What is that all about? God, you hung up on the call of Sandy. We don't talk to Merrill candidates on the show. Okay. We're not Steve Clark, isn't it? No, this is Miami. Oh, Metro. Oh, Metro. Okay. How long have you lived here that you know nothing about any mayor Miami, isn't he? He's not the mayor. Miami is the mayor of date counting. Metro day. I get so confused. All in his case, does it make you exactly? Yeah, exactly. There's no feeling for it. Anyway, our topic today on the Paul Long. Show, do we have the right to die? That's what Dennis Collins is going to be asking me after the book comes up. Over at WOLB. How you doing, Dennis? I hate to break the news for it, but I'm not going to Loretto, Texas, Dennis. Not this week. Okay. Boy, it's shocking. And what goes on in this market, all these subterfuge and all these wild stories. So I guess, Tanner over there in Cox, I bet you we don't hear from Cox today. I got my fingers crossed in my toes, even when I said that. But they're going to be really nervous. No, he's over there. I think it's not only a spot 105, pick in a crap out of them, but now they're going to have I-95. I don't even get out of bed tomorrow. Well, I think Tanner can relate to this. Yeah. As a matter of fact, I haven't feeling that this is probably, no, seriously, there's probably one of the local radio pundits in the market now. He's analyzing the whole thing before the first number comes off the computer. Like I said, really? Well, he's meditating right at the moment. Or something very close. Who? If we had a psychic doing the weather on his station, and she gave the weather before the information came out with that, the premature evacuation. Anyway, it's 1033, a WI-O-D. Let's give the numbers that, because I see, we're, you know, we got a stall for a little while. I have nothing yet. I thought Sharon would already be running up and down the hall, but probably our computer is on the blink again. Or one of our rocket scientists in programming doesn't know how to get it running. I saw something like the last time. Remember when the last trend came up, I'll see today for those of you novices out there, both of you and the audience who are not in the business. The trends that are like month to month, those are, those are okay, but this is like the big deal. Because three, four times a year, we have a book. In fact, you hear these pseudo intellectuals who call in these people like to sound like they're part of it. Oh, is the book coming in, you know, that cut here, the book. And anyway, the radio book is like for Regina, March, this is the winter book, which once upon a time, there wasn't any winter book in this market. Those were the good old days. Okay, well, we had two books a year. We'd have to go through this crap, but now they've decided for some reason that it's a major market. They didn't really decide that, but they decided like to get the money for four times a year at Arbitron. Oh, yeah. So they soaked the crap out of these poor bastards in a four times a year. We have to go through this, okay? It means 48 out of the 52 weeks were in ratings. Yeah. So we'd already give a blindly put out of them anyway, right? Just like over a day, they didn't care. If you had good ratings, they didn't care if you had bad ratings, they didn't care which is why. I know. There's coming back. Boy, remember Zeta? Boy. Which time the first time it'll last time? Yeah, either time. Those were the days. I know. I can't, I'm going to be excited. Now they're going to change a call at his back to INZFM. Good question. Let's take up an office pool. Are they going to change a call at his from Zeta back to INZFM when they go back to INZFM? I know. 95, you'd think so. You know, they never changed them on the building. Remember? They always went out. They had a little, a pre-mote. They left about the building. Yeah. No dummies. Oh boy. What's that word that we came up with? Oh, Delima. Let's find out how they solved these. Zeta Delima. A little later on in the show. Well, you'll hear it first here. You can go to the bank on that. Anyway, this Saturday, if I maybe eat a new eye on you. I'll get a little bit of it. Okay. I told you. 10.5. Well, he's carried away. Okay. How did once he did by the way? Did we give their number? I think they went up a little bit. Yeah. That's nice. This is our, for in the business show, we do this like it once a month. Yeah. It's got to like have an a period, you know. Yeah. Waxy, 3-1-3-9. What are a lot of people who are right now? Okay. Here's our number, ladies and gentlemen. 12 plus 10-3. Well, see we inherit the first hour of Steve Jyashins. That Steve had his best book ever, I think. Great book. We went, let's see. Life was number one as they always are. We were in the elevator music with an eight four, but they don't count. W-I-O-D from a four, six to a seven three, when we came here was a three. Wow. It's a seven three. More than double. When you do had to be in the seven. It was boom boom. We see that one. And a QOM has risen like 35,000 people or 25,000 people. 185,000, which was about what it was. It's an INZ one we were doing. And the time spent listening is up to seven hours a week. Good. It came here was like three. Seven hours a week. That's like an hour and a half a day. It's Monday through Friday. More than said. Hot midday. We even beat hot. Would you shock you? It is six three. We beat Earl the Pearl. Magic at a four nine and midday. Waxi at a four four. GTR 3041. Here are those bonded 25 to 54 numbers ladies and gentlemen. Here we go with another. The other hand. But it's shocking. Number one 10-A-M-2-3-P-M. W-I-O-D with an 8-6 and 25-54. An unprecedented number in the A-M radio. Yeah. Since they had more one than one station. I know what we came here in the summer was a two-seven and a fall, which we were a little bit of just a tiny bit of that a four or five and out of an 8-6. 25-54, okay? But I don't know about your show because you're eating on your... I'm better, but I can't tell you're show and we don't know. Yeah. Get out of here, Henry. Let's flatten him up against what he's got to do the nose. Got air him out for a couple of minutes. What year? 25-54 and 8-6. Magic at an 8-Hot had a six-8 midday. Waxi at five-2. Try to get people to talk about two radio stations after that a clock in the morning. Okay. Well, we're trying right now. The DPRP shut up. GTR of 36 up to a four-8 midday is 25-54. Gloves five-8 to a four-rate. Hmm. While 102-4 to a three. Oh, we never gave the while 100 more. I was just wondering, did we? Yeah, I guess we did. They went down from a four-something to a four-something. About a half a point. Hmm. What about midday for Gons, you're 25-54? Oh, right. I didn't even try and book. Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah. Why what did the... He went to the roof and the trim. Yeah. He went nuts. That Gonser. Anyway, let's give Steve's number because he did tremendous... If I can find a damp thing, here it is. This is 12-plus 3-7-PM. Hot had a nine-one in the afternoon. Can you believe that? Dennis Reese. 12-plus. And one, maybe life, who had a seven. How are had a four-seven? IOD-4-7. Steve up from a three-nine to a four-seven. Okay? How do you like that? Great. Continue doing those Eastern Airlines shows. If you continue ignoring Boy Gary, he can get over a five. Okay. I'm a serious. Magic of four-six. GTR of four-five. Boy, G, and I wonder, they're just there going nuts here. Man, they're salivating in a hall. They're having a little orgy out there. Because both stations went through the roof here, okay? Chouping up and down. I mean, you know, GTR got a fluke and we went nuts. A wak, he had a four-two. And you remember the last trend and the spike-wise was acting like a jacket. And I said, if you look at the pattern, the first two months of air-ve booked, they go down. And then the third, they go through the roof. And sure enough, they came right, it's like a pattern, every book. Okay? But he just gets so emotional and starts throwing those telephone through the wall and making holes in the wall. Now, look at us. Three to seven after the drive 12 plus data. Consistency is the mark of quality. They stayed at a 180. Ha ha ha ha. Now, you guys are denying the rumors over there. I just want to say, they never changed the call letters on the building. Just remember that. I'm fine. I'm fine. We've turned the corner on. I'm not even fine. And now we're on the turnpike. Ha ha ha. Headed out of town. I'm like to, uh, eat hot junction. They'd be big one. That's a good idea. Listen, they can have a station, seriously. They can have a station. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. People on the turnpike. Sure. You know, how like when you go through the tunnel, they got that station in four-later Hill and Disney's got his own say they could have the E-Hard Junction turnpike station. Okay? And sell the motorists. Yeah. Like stopping get your gas and eat it right Roger stuff like that. Okay. That's going to do it if you're bored by these numbers. Well, we got 1,000 more come up. So just stick around. Stay glued to your seats and have a nice day, Dennis, and all you other folks out there. We got Henry, who just barely going to get through the new sketch. I think it will come back at 11.05. 1, 2, 3. Mark, call 75, 1, W-I-O-D-Indeed. 5, 2, 4, W-I-O-D and Broadway. Or 65, 5, and 2, 7, 8. W-I-O-D and the Palm beaches. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neil Rogers, on New Start Radio 6, and W-I-O-D. And you know what they say about that guy? He's an orange or a provocateur. He's an orange or a provocateur. Okay, 11-05. It's W-I-O-D. And it's ratings day. This is the winter booklet, he's in German. All these numbers, they just keep coming out. It's like, it's like a never-ending nightmare. You know, it's like you just are lying there, hoping to wake up some day and hoping all the stuff goes away. You know, we continue doing well. We go up in every trend on every station. Then we go up in every virtually every trend on Saturday. Every month there was like a little glitch. But in here, we go up in every trend. When we came here in 25 to 54s, they had in midday. And I know they got it. It doesn't care. But you know something? We don't care about you. No, we don't care if they all dropped it. There's long somebody else comes along to replace him. It was a little younger because we want to have like 18 to 34s. Yeah, in summer of 88, 25 to 54, they had a 27. Who's she having? Then in the fall, when we came over, it was a four-five. A little bit, it was a four-five. Now it's an eight-six in a winter-five. I think this is like a little ego trip because it doesn't mean anything. And it's salespeople are still going to be doodle birds. And they'll still find new excuses. Oh, they always do. Wappen. Those numbers are a little bit too high. They got everybody scared now. Everybody scared away. And they just said, they don't know if they can not handle it. Oh boy. So we're still waiting for the rest of the 25 to 54. So we can see what's Steve did. Let's see, Steve had a 47. But we didn't find out what Alice did. We didn't find out what Sandy did. We got so carried away, basking our own glory. So let's get to it. Okay, we did seven, three in midday. Now we're Sandy. Sandy. Here Sandy. Not on page two. Not on page two. Never went to use to get five. Sandy down from a three-nine to a three-two. Tied for four-five. What odious station are they tied for? Or while 100. Yeah. In midday when all the kids are in school, that figures. And Steve had a four-seven. And Alice in the afternoon, a WOLD in 12 plus from a three-seven to a three. So Steve is like, I mean, Alice is hanging right on the edge there, falling into the twos. A three. Wait a minute. Wait down. Everybody over there. Remember morning drive is way down. Now, look, Alice is trending here. It's summer of four, four, fall of three-seven. And now down to a three. And they're fighting part of that. At 2.9% of those people are brain dead. They're over the age of 150. Other AK. No, Alice. I met you at the palace. Oh, you're doing. Oh, my god. Things are not good. It's y'all mine and used to say, okay, seven-midnight, 12 plus. Hot with a 12-three at night. Look at that. That keeps eyesley, man. He's a turn-o-s-cray-o-z. I'm a judge of the weapons now. A tower with the six-two. Wild and hundred, with a four-eightnid. Life with a four-seven, by most of their people are asleep by that. Wins with a four-three down from a five-long course. That's when Bruce Williams's pronunciation, I guess. W. News, which neuro-in-comedy from a five-two-a-four-o, I think that's their lowest-night-time number at ages. Well, most of the jares, people are... Ha ha. Six-feet under now on a Ho-Chimian trip. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Love's 94 or 29 at night. If Joe's listening over at magic 25 to a 3-2, I just go and Joe, every day you'll get over a 3-5. IOD at night 3-2 to a 2-4. See, that was the nighttime in a weekend. We do have that bumper sticker. It says the weekends are deadly on WI. And the nighttime's are just a little less deadly. OK, but now that we got boy Gary, we might get some of the big name town on like boom boom at night or something. And like that alive living and breathing person, huh? Well, almost. From a shove in a midnight. OK, let's do a little break here. Because it's early, but let's get it out of the way. Because I'm just so emotional. I'm just overwrought with emotion. Of course, all the ball is no cause. It's five-stinking calls. Because you got it and it doesn't care about this. But the one good thing we've found at the beginning of the show are a little mini survey. They don't care about it now. So we don't take it personally. Because we just have it in different audience. It doesn't really basically give a damn about anything. Who's just doing what we want? Right? Yeah. Whatever the hell is. Any of people down in South-Dade and Kendall and down in that area? Remember when we talked about that one place, a great restaurant, which I don't want to, you know, tremendous restaurant. And they did not get little response, which is unusual for us. Because we do phenomenal for almost all our restaurants. Yeah. And I was asking you if anybody in South-Dade still speaks English. Because it's just really, do we have any audience down there in South-Dade? Well, I told you. I know we got a big audience of you, a fan. Yo, he's free. I'm very, very upset about a trend in South-Dade. Fying to say. On your eat. They're running movies, dubbed in Spanish, occasionally on HBO. And I'm going to call store like today. And this is going to continue. I'm dropping. I have to have some of those cable companies long enough. No. I'm going to pick up cinematics or something. But this is, it crossed my ass a little bit. You know, to, they were running live in daylight. You said the James Bond movie in the Spanish. I mean, what's going on here? Cheers. Well, it's a movie. Hey, guys. It's a South-Dade La Mignana. What are you, brother? It's a South-Dade. Yeah. He had a pretty good dozen. He's an orange-owned provocateur. All right. It's 11. 11 and W. I do. I want fatherly to do that in Espanol. We'll be right back. What's the Haca trying to come out of Sticken, VCR, again, and about, uh, oh, come on. Well, he just said one curve. Coto, call. Yeah, I don't think that's- We don't care. I don't either. That's your problem, okay. Do I come in on the air and bitch about my, uh, satellite and all that stuff? Ha ha ha ha. I've got-that's seriously. I may have some shocking. I already got the information, but I may discuss it on the air to our all-depending, pending what goes on with our day, Lima today. Oh, yeah. We may have a story tomorrow that will make new hair growing, places in your body. You'd have a better day. Anyway, it's 11.14 at W. I did. It's our little, rating celebration party here today, and I noticed that boy Gary even brought all kinds of stuff kinds of stuff into the studio here, messed it up pretty bad too. Mm-hmm. We believe in a clean studio, Gary. Cleanliness comes first. Okay, a clean body, a clean mind. Lead to clean numbers. Okay. Like zeros. Now, we miss some Z-D numbers here somewhere along the way. Yeah, let's get to this. Now, Gonsio went from a 16 to a 17 and 12 plus. We wanted them all the credit in the world, because they always said he may not be good, but he's consistent. Through the rhythm. At the bottom. What did they do at night? Because nighttime they've been struggling. That lady calls her once away. Yeah. They turn the corner at night, ladies and gentlemen, from a one-o-to-a-one-three. So they've done it, but overall, all we have a news bulletin. Now, that's exciting. Probably about Z-D. 1115 at W-I-O-D. Good morning, guys. I'm having a two. I couldn't set it better. Oh, that. Anybody who's a wine kind of sewer always is an old shop production tool. Anyway, to 1116 at W-I-D, we got an open line in Broward. How could we have a couple open lines here, man? We're having like a little party, okay? And we don't want you to call it and tink all over his eye. Congratulations, great number. But if you're like in a business and you're desperate, you wonder if you still got a job. We'll be happy to answer it. Now, we're at, we're at the 18 to 34 numbers. Are we going to have to go through that same crap again? Yeah. We're the rest of the 25 to 54s, because I know Steve is just like hanging on the edge of his sofa by a baseball card. And I'm sure he wants to hear how he did 25 to 54, because that's where the big bucks are, okay? And all they gave us, now I didn't mention this yet. W-I-D tied for third overall, the whole week 25 to 54, up from a 47 to a 5-4. Did I mention it? I did. Mm-hmm. Oh, I'll mention it again. Good. 3, 3 in the summer, 47, and a fall, 5-4 overall. Tied for third, an AM station behind hot and magic. God. Tied with CMQ, it doesn't even count. Nice company. And I had a glove. Nice company. And I had a GTR at a 5. And I had, oh, you're going to go nuts. Ah. Now, W-I-O-D, in 25 to 54 is beating out Waxi. Morning show is the hey man, do you have a canner to this morning? I do here what we constructed. I'm all evidently not. Haha. Haha. Yeah. Wow. And where is the morning 25 to 54? See, we still got a lot of holes. I mean, it's nice. They brought us in all these numberboarders. Where's the rest of them? It's just like last time. Remember where the trend came out? Same thing. Now there's no excuses this time, because everybody's excited. They're probably smashed on the floor and passed it out and then, uh, in a computer room, okay, from the celebration. 8, 6. God. It's great. Shocking. I don't know whether the scream read a banana. I don't know. I think we just got a rest on our laurels now. See, that's what those says. Wow, you know, Neil's gotten lazy now. They're not doing homework anymore. They don't come in to anything creative. We haven't done anything creative. Who's here? Okay? Who we told don't do anything creative. Hey, that we tried to do some creative. We're getting trouble, okay? So we just show up and act ignorant and the audience relates to what our content is. God, it goes to prove the dummy you are and the dummy you behave, the bigger the audience. That's America, right? Now our show on Transvestite, Pig Meas begins in noon. Wow. Look at that, a five one for W. I told you, did I say to you this morning, Johnny Dark was sitting here. I said, we got to break a five. There's no excuse. This station, even with the horrendous nighttime and weekend, we don't want to talk about once we get some of this stuff on a weekend, other way we get make back on that old show up to week. Oh yeah, like a dead weight. It's not messy, make it so upset. It's just a little joke. I mean, there's some truth in it, but it's just a little joke. It's 1118 at W. I. Don't you think somebody ought to send some food over something? Because I'm not going to my mother's. I need to get my glasses, my lens is not lens is frames. Because I sat on it. We have to feed Johnny. We got to feed Johnny Dark because he hasn't worked in years now. Yeah. Yeah. I said in at least 20 minutes. And we got to feed Johnny Dark when we have a radio celebrity pastor present and usually it's past. We like to feed him. Didn't feed boom boom though, you know, that probably was the reason that show was a little flat, man. I'm sure boy, I'm sure boy, Gary will run out. No, Tim, so bad that they I can't. You know, never be forgiven. God will punish you. You'll be at the pearly gates. And he'll say, I'm sorry, but we're closing the gate for one phone call. You were a pretty decent guy. The rest of it. I'm your stole some albums. We can forgive you for that. But they've called him that was unforgivable. Okay. Oh, yeah. I just, yeah. I just, yeah. I think like you have a little daily. Yeah, something they have a daily. Something just popped in by the brain. He's TV receiver. Something popped in my brain. What was that? Well, there's a high 95. Yeah, that one maybe it can be over an 95 recording. Now, there's that old line Friday. It's just came in the studio. Ladies and gentlemen, we haven't seen her in a long time. I'm sure. What was I going to ask her about? Something about all of you. They got those pictures. You better go in there and beat him up. No. Here it's Tuesday. I'm just, don't say I didn't tell you. They took the pictures like 10, stinking weeks ago. We got these gigantic numbers. Would you people better start selling by the way now? And we don't have those pictures. Okay. Now, if I go on a year and tell all these speakers out there. We're going to have the pictures. You better see to what that the douchebag and they're getting. Okay. That boy Gary, that's it. Step on him. Call done. Kick him in the head. All of the where there's no sense on it. Yeah, I get done on the phone as you were a picture star. Here at WIOD where we lie a lot. But not about the numbers man. And I remember the old days on IOD. There were certain people used to kind of fudge about the numbers a little bit or they would ignore them. I don't want to match a day name. But now that they're real good, we talk about them a lot. I mean, to the point of being nausea. How do I guess Steve won't spend too much time on him today, right? No. All of a sudden, we did have a 47 and Alice had a three. And that's in 12 plus and if they would ever get busy and bring us the rest of the 25 to 54 is then you'd really see something. Okay. Because I guarantee you Steve beat him more than double. Probably triple in 25 to 54. Yeah. And least. And what do we do now? How did Sandy do 25 to 50? Poor Sandy. We've ignored her. I apologize. Sandy. Well, we had an 86 and 25 to 54. Let's say it again. Then we had an 86 and 25 to 54. And I said again. Then we had an 86 and 25 to 54. I was on the third page. A 104. Whoa. Down from a 18. On the road to non exist. One four. Well, what do you do? One more show a month with that TV repairman. You could turn the corner. She could be on the same highway with Zeta. I 95. I pretty soon you're going to see a lot of radio people in this market on I 95. I've headed north. Okay. All packed up. Head of north never to be seen again. Like Steve Perrin on the radio bus. Steve Perrin from why 100. Gone. Gone. Gone. This is terrible because we saw like we're happy. Well, I am happy because they should only rot over at while 100. That's my per not everybody over there. There must be some nice people out of no any. Are there? Certainly not the raw. The raw. One maybe one. There's one. Oh yes. Among used to work there. Remember Simone? Oh, she's. Oh. Go. I had an 8 radio shows or tough. Yeah. They really are. Oh, here come those numbers. I wonder what the hell Sharon's been doing. He's probably had Steve on the fun. Almost 25 to 54 is accept hours. I mean ours are great, but we want to, you know, talk about what is this. We already got that morning drive like Reneri who's got a 5.3. He stayed the same. He's tied for 3rd and 25 to 54. That's a big number in the morning for a 25 to 54 is Steve with a 5.5. I think that's his biggest number ever in 25 to 54. Okay. And you know what they say about Steve is an on-zone provocateur. Sure. I agree. And the only people to beat him a hot who's just like going crazy and magic 8177 and Steve with a 5.5. What did Alice do in 25 to 54? What is not on page 2. That's obvious he's not on page 2. He is on. I like that. Wait a minute. I just came to Zeta. After you drive 25 to 54 or 25 up from a 2 4. I still have to come to. Here's wins. One nine to a 2 1. Here she. Two three to a 1 8. Oh, here's Alice. Wait down from a 1 8 to a 1 6. I did not say Steve would be crippled or more. Three times 1 6 is a 4 8. So he did like 3 and a half times in 25 to 54. Okay Alice. Oh god. You know, I really hate to do this. I don't believe in rubbing so much. I really don't. Level is a little low on that. I'm thinking of machine. Oh no. I want everybody to hear the lyrics. Nice one. Okay 24. Okay 24. 11. I just a little sampling there for Alice. I don't think he's going to want to hear him when we get through. What do you want Phil? I don't want to deal with the. You wanted to see what? The weather book. The phone book on she's morning show. Okay. Here's another one of these guys who want to know. I want to know. I want to know. Oh. Well, let's see. 6 to 10 a.m 12 plus. Yeah. Just relax now Phil. Don't get the high problem. I've turned a lot of pages to get to your numbers. I'm sure. Okay. Well, I'm going to go to the fourth page. That's not bad. One, two, and a winner book. Oh, that's pretty weak. Oh, you want to see the fall boy. Yeah. Oh, that's good. One, seven. Oh, good. I believe. So that's a half a point drop. Now 25 to 54. You want those? Call one. Of course. What's that? How? 25 to 54. She. I have to turn several pages to get to them. Yeah. I'm going to go to the fourth page. Oh, you're really good. Are they must have missed me? Yeah. Now let's have the fall book. There's a lot of over there. Congratulations. It goes without saying. Thank you, Phil. Yeah. Bye. Well, let's 11. 45. I have a big shit. Let's tell you about shells right now. They don't get the arrogant now. But when the day comes, that we have that Lookbook, and we got like a water something. Then it'll be a different story. And it'll all be dancing on our graves out there in a hallway. And Disney will be looking in with an ugly look and spike wise. They'll be frowning and throwing telephones to the wall. Yeah. The evil stuff that goes on every day. And the salespeople have it. They had another excuse. Anyway, it's just a joke. And don't get hyper. It's a well. It's partly a joke. We want to get you out to shells for a great dinner because I don't have time for this. Okay. We're busy talking here. And then we have to keep coming back. You know. Well, maybe if we play some interesting stuff. You know, the people of Don Care about the ratings. They want to be entertained too, right? These back. And he's stalking a cycle who wants to make the Chicago Cubs. Pinnit contenders. Clint Eastwood is dirty hairy carry. How everybody is hiring. Curry was Steve Stone. Compton goodness. Be not on the way. Clint Eastwood gives a whole of fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster. There's action. The pit. Strike it to the. He's through that. All right. Passports. Suspense. It's piping. It's cut me. It is a. The romance. Oh, look at the. To net broad Steve. Holy cow. Clint Eastwood is dirty hairy carry. Coming to a theater near you. Or we back. See what I mean? We're busy doing stuff and here and this stuff keeps ending. We got to play like some something long. We're not that. Okay. It's 30 in W.I.O.D. I see the reason I'm not taking any calls is because like they're only forced. They can cause you on it. It's obviously a re-belling against this. They can't deal with it. They're revolting. Even more revolting than that. Yesterday for a Monday we did very well. Yeah. Not a great show. But from Monday it was pretty. Solid. You know what I'm saying? We had actually a lot of calls. No. Most of them. We didn't even have to. So I guess everybody in the business has got all the information. They've got the 18 to 34 numbers. If Sharon can hear us if she's within the sound of my voice. Where are those? Think in 80. Why do they do this every time? Every time. I realize. See they don't. When I first came here they kept giving me the 35 plus. I said, this. I said, forget that. It's 25 to 54. See they still didn't believe that on AM. You can really do it. Now here we are with only in 8.6 and 25 to 54 in the day. And Steve's got a 55. And when he was got a 5. 3. So we're like kicking ass all across the board. Like I said, you'll 6. PM. In 25 to 54. But 18 to 34. Now we went from a 0.6 when we came here last trend. We had a 5.5 and 18 to 34. Which for AM is like in a twilight song. Meaningless, except it's an ego trip for us. And since in this business they're usually deflating your ego all they can do. At least on ratings they win their good. At least you can do is go on the air and crow about it. Yeah, because it's the one thing they can't stop. You know, here they are. Well the only way they stop it is not by you. And I think that what's the thing that they're making people is now because I just saw old Watchers name there in the hallway. Oh, no. Who doesn't speak to what you want? How about if we got a 10? What would it take? Oh, seriously. This is going to be our poll question. What number and we need to get to for field of speaking? I don't know about a 15 here. Now here. Oh, look at Mike. Mike. I think he got 18 to 33 stores. Here he is. I'll sit down. I'll get comfortable. Oh, he's coming on to my mind. I'll make him up. This is my mind. I'm going to get a 30. Wait, let me give you the phone to throw through the wall. Just like it. I'll even Disney smoking now. Look at that. Look where he's got this a guard too. Shotty. What does that say for GTR? Wow. What is that? What do you make these up in? 7 in 1. Uh, adult's 18 years old. Take me to your 12. Full weight, right? You, hot meat. But you're number two. 10. Well, hot beat them. At a 14 9. Well, sure. Once in a while, I'll get a food. And next is POW. What hour? Yeah. Oh, power had a 75. Love had a 5. Six. Newry. Thank you so much. And what are these? Oh, here's midday. Hot had a 13. Oh, I'm Tony. That's exactly what he's got. Electric crayons. That guy's nuts. Seriously, if you start eating fish eggs, I'm Tony. The work for every time. The guys incredible. 13 for hot and midday. Team to 34. GTR had a 10 8 up from what? A hundred four. Yeah. Power had a 65 down a 10th of a point. Gloves had a 6 2. And IOD was number five in 18 to 34 with a 6 1. I think this means we got you, Neil. Oh. Yeah, but our people can spell. Waxy had a 5 4 midday. Oh, geez. You know, he's going to be real unhappy over there. You know how emotionally he gets. He gets pretty emotional. That's the kind of stuff that we strive for. Well, maybe one day you'll achieve it. Yeah. Well, it was a 4 5. Why 100 midday? 18 to 34 doubtable. 4 4. Now, what about morning drive? How did that? A lot of 100 because, yeah. How the kernel. That's it. The 34 morning drive. GTR 9 1 to a 12. Oh. That was number two. That was like 14. Nothing. I hate more than a guy. Krowing. You ask. I'm really a don't say. I stopped getting emotional now. Oh, the kernel was up. Ah. He's gone to the roof. Three, three to a three eight. Good. Wow. That was the 295. The number. Yeah. Yeah. We had a 10 5. Look at this. Sandie 18 to 34 was down from a 140. A point three. That's like you could put them in auditorium. Okay. And have room left over. Where the hell is theta 18 to 31? Where is that gone? Come on, Gonds. We know you can do it. Look at it. A 4 2. There's the story. Gonds. You had a 4 2 in midday. Oh. I know you're not going to give it to us. You won't relinquish. Oh. Okay. Let's see. 6 to 10 a.m. Who are we looking for? Look like she had a good book. Yeah. They turned the corner. They turned the same corner that's it. Did you hear the room where about? Does it? No. They're going dance music. Oh, I want to see Ella 18 to the eye 95. Why 95? Don't like that kind of stuff. He's gone. I'll do. Let's see. Three three. Well, he's not gone. Well, he's going. He's going. Going. I'll do three. Three 18 to 30 40. What do you say Ella said a number that will live in the Ailes of Broadcast history? Point five. Down from a one four. So he lied. Two thirds. He lost two of those three. That he had. Well, you talk about jury entry. Okay. Thank you so much. Well, you're welcome. Anytime. What was that on GTR again for? 7 6 to 10 7. See, if you would. If you don't put your eyes, which I know for you was an easy. You'd notice that the first two trends of every book for GTR. You get screwed. Okay. There's a pattern there. If you go back over the last two years, it's the same pattern every time. And the third month, they finally get the sampling right into goes way up. And then you get the numbers. So instead of getting his sterical and howdy and giving us a bunch of crap. Grow up a little bit. Well, yeah. Have a cigar. Exactly. If you put in the right spot, we'll even light it for you. Okay. There he goes. I'll go with. R of W GTR. Stay in the screen. It's 11 35 in W I O D. And don't forget this. Yeah, today now, this could be kind of like our reading celebration. We're going to have free bagels and hot dogs and all kinds of goodies there. And lots of bumper stickers. Steve's got those new bumper stickers. And I got the old ones. And we might even have the pictures. And of course, they've got loads and loads of. All right. Wait a minute. We've had all these rumors today. We do like to be fair. We just had a report from Rose over in Carroll City. It might not be as bad. It's the double one thing. Yeah. Sunny wants. While in a morning, 18 to 34. What is two light? He already spiked to combat. Oh, yeah. Those are really good. You got to be able to quicker on the draw. He's giving you every other pain in the ass while 100 number. Now just bug off. They're the program directors gone. You got to be dancing a jay. Absolutely. A three year old program director. He's gone. Sunny. Oh, you're right. God. Way to San Jose. Yeah. With bells on his nose and rings on his nose. He really blew that. Remember what I always say about when we have a good trend. Oh, look at the phone. Three lines. I'm not saying we take any. Yeah, but it sure. It's see it's the way of evening things out in this market. You can never have a big ao. The numbers come in. You can have this enormous. Could have an 80 sure. And they would. We're not going to talk to him. We don't want to get him to get a big head. You know. Well, screw you folks, too. Okay. That's the way we feel about it. We sure appreciate your loyalty. Have a nice day and go to hell. Like some of that mail we get. You know, nor that one thing where they sent me that. Information and about you'd really enjoy this and then the letter went on and just ripped the car. I'm sure about the car phones. Yeah. And said, these are these are great models. I have two of them. They really work great. They do a line. They do a line. I still have a lot of seen it. They're going to rip us. Okay. So it was incredible. All right. We're going to get the numbers out. One time and then we'll assume that we totally bored our regular. Look at that. They're all three lines in data. Let the whole rest of the board is as blank as the management's brain. Wow. Thank you. It's like a giant vacuum. We don't particularly appreciate your attitude. Okay, folks. Oh, but we can always kind of this call. Right? Yeah. You know, I don't think things are really, oh, now they're going. Now, as soon as they heard your voice, they call you a question. I don't think there was ever any question that you guys would keep greatness. Yeah. Yeah. Probably because of your calls, right? I didn't say that. Or is it in spite of your calls? It's in spite of my call. Are you going to be their Saturday call? Where's that? At Toyota. What? Are you going to be their call? No. Come to the next one. We finally embarrassed the sales department at the getting them in on these things. I said from now on, after this one. Okay. Are we ever going to have one of these non-radio type get together? Sure. That's not going to happen. I don't see why not. Yeah. Because that's your fun. We could have like an old E-Mac and Bollio's reunion. Now that the restaurants out of business. There you go. What's their own five? Now that they govern themselves according to their own four. Right out of business. But I mean, you know, with all these, this poor rating, there's so many talented people out of work out there. Johnny just raised his hand. Johnny dark for example. And all during the breaks he's been going, I'd be, I'd be, I'd be, I'd be pretty well soon. Well, 35 to 64 just came in. This ought to be really heavy duty for Dallas. Especially when we get to the 60 plus part. No, I'd be five. That was kind of like a 20 type station. Was it not? Yeah. It was kind of like, why 100? No, I could just picture. What? Damn. Yeah. I can see Stan on a high 95. I could picture it. I could picture it. Let's see. 35 to 64. We didn't have category. Probably not to grade 10 to 3. Look at that. We were second. Life had an 89. We had a 7-8. How the hell is that? Well, we must have like mostly 35 to 54. Right? Hmm. Master. That is John. 7-8. Well, we just kicked ass everywhere, didn't we? Well, that'll show those. Braended salespeople a finger to Steven. He afternoon had a 5-7. I'm from a 5-6, 5-7. And Alice still don't show to good. Because I'm telling you to 65 plus. Don't show too much. Yeah, 29 to 22 in the afternoon. 35 to 64. So their audience is almost all 65 plus. I'd be embarrassed. You know what I'm saying? Sounds like a lot of preparation. What? The one that they're giving away 5 or 1. They're trying to keep their few listeners alive over there. All right. Well, I think again, congratulations. And you guys are by far the bottom. Oh, is he gone? He's gone. Huh. Why do you want to talk some more to all now? Because I didn't. No, no. He's OK, but boy, it's very small, though. It's like about 10 words at a time. It's 1141 at WID. We're going to get these numbers out. And then we expect to see some incredible action in this studio. Action? Well, it's food action. That's right. Oh, yeah. Mentally and physically. We have to have these young years. Yeah. 751, WIOG. Today, we want you to call it and tickle all over everybody here. Now, come on. Call it and say how great it was. Even though you don't mean it. Even though you couldn't care less. OK? Now, do we have a separate column like reduced banks? Because I know we're number one in do Spag. You know question. No contest. Uh, we, let's see, an open line in day. One in Broward. Five, two, four WID. And then if we can get vocal it, we get those other three lines lit. We'll have the full board of calls. So we've been waiting for all more. See, I don't really care about the numbers. I like to see a full board of calls. Cause you know what? Stances. I have the busy signal thing complex. Mm-hmm. Whatever he calls it, central. And then he gets started to two calls and starts to, you know, hyperventilating on the air with his cigar. Wow. OK, there's Boken. I'll get that other Broward line going there. Even if it's, you know who? Now, why are you waiting for that? I want to give you this little tid, tid bit. That was the turning point for us, by the way. You know, I'm dying over there. Yeah, that was a, you have a dilemma. Yeah. Well, it's in the new and choir. I just want sentence. I just want to, I just notice this in the new and choir. I just want to read this to you. Michael Jackson. Got all the time in the world for Palmarland, Brando. He gave his buddy a $1 million antique pocket watch for his 65th birthday. Just wanted sort of to put that out. So you, which pocket did he put it? He was he wearing his glove. Yeah, those are the things that America is hiring mind one and all. OK, and that's the kind of information that we strive for, underlined in red. It is underlined in red. Look at that story. We have a witness. It's underlined in red. Pink. Without Ricky Tickie man, he kind of gave us the guidance. He was like the inspiring, the guiding light for this show. Without him, without those talk up. Ah, not seriously. As a matter of fact, I think in honor. Yeah. Good. I don't know why you're laughing. I'm dead serious about this. This is not laughing kind of stuff. This is heavy duty serious stuff now. OK. To try to control yourself. Well, we went a long time without these. Yeah. Yeah. That's what the power is to try. That's what happens. And one of the ways, one of the very easy, and he had an extensive underlined in red. Wait, he's a queen. That is the queen. What do you do? And things, those things. What are you doing? Oh, Ricky. See, even he's excited. That was shocking. One of the things I think we ought to add another point out of waxed numbers. You're not going to have that talk up. OK, that was shocking. That was beautiful. Ricky, we take back everything we've ever said about you. You're a genius in your own mind. OK, and if you ever took that cap off your brains with spill all over the radio. I'm talking. Wow. Line six is down. Oh, it's down. It's down. It's down. Line six is dead. I think it's probably from the pressure from these calls here today. It's hello. Oh, yeah, Dennis. You're a senior in your power. Oh, yeah. It wasn't Dennis recent, either. OK, 1144. It's okay. 1144. I don't feel so bad. If we could say that about three or four lines were out, then I'd feel better, even if they're not say that they're out. And then I'll feel a little better. Oh, here's a Pembroke Pines GTR listener. I bet you spike will go nuts on this call. Yeah. Didn't know how many of us being these guys. What? I don't know. Spike was mentioning it. No, no, no, no, no. They're not on it the same time, pal. Wait a minute. What was Spike bragging about? Cause in 18 to 34 GTR had a, what did they have like a 10 to 10? 4? Yeah, they had a 6-1. Yeah. Also the whole space should be WD. No. No, how did he get a 5-1? They had a 4. What was their guy bragging about the GTR? I mean, I just got you telling me he'd be the 34. That's their audience. They got a bunch of, how old are you? I'm 30. Well, there you go. He did a 34, but you're young, a bit, pinheads. Space cadets. All right. And you just don't want to give someone a bean credit. What credit is there? They're great, man. I think we just have some fun with them. Don't you understand? And if they ever gotten that, they'd really be good. Yeah. They'd throw the ratings in the textbook or drop a little. Yeah, just a hair. Yeah. If we can say that. You probably got more in one. I wouldn't be surprised. You'd have probably tell you where it is to know an ex-filthy show they go. Okay. Listen, have a great life. Yeah. Those Herman and Veeam listeners, were they're very uptight? You know what I'm saying? See, part of the reason that they finally have gone up though is because we're not on FM in a morning anymore. Don't describe Robert as a listener. So I'm saying that he doesn't want to admit it because he doesn't want to hurt their feelings. There's so sense of it. Oh, yeah. And you notice they sent us over all their bad material now that they won't use on either. What do you think they're trying to tell us something? Well, yeah, they're hoping they can get our numbers down a little bit. Okay. We do have it open line and date County. I just mentioned that in one and a hour now. Oh, man. I'll tell you this is so deflating. I feel like we got a one. Wouldn't it be nice to have? See, I'm on those people I expect too much. I really do expect too much. I expect people to care and they don't care. They don't give a flying leap one way or the other. And that's my problem. Especially in this town. We saw that at the beginning of the show. We proved it with that scientific poll we took. They don't care. And at least they're honest about it. Okay. They're not going to think of all over the area. We care. They don't care. Don't bother us. We want to be left alone. And I can relate to that. The receptionist from WQAM. I would like the morning ratings. Oh, man. You know that receptionist. He's an ocean provocateur. Okay. WQAM in the morning ladies and gentlemen. Six to 10 AM, which is kind of moot because they got the dick motherly over there now. Now they do. WQAM along the last page. And I'm still searching. Here they are second from the bottom. Tied for last with WRH. See, you know, speaking less. 0.7. God. Which is up from a point six. And it was up from a point four before that. And the summer. Motherly. Motherly. I'll get him up to at least a point eight. And in twenty. Twenty five to fifty. Four is in the morning. I know that. He's an ocean. In the morning. Where the hell are they? Oh, here we go. I got all these sheets. I got real sheet problems here. Six to 10 in the morning. Twenty five to fifty for our bench. They're on the last sheet of this. So that started the back. Yeah. Go away down. EAT. Well, that's not in the market. Rockin' big daddy. Radio Swave. She with a point nine is right down there. And QAM tied them. There's three way tie for next to last. QAM. Radio Swave. When you're tied with radio Swave. Yeah. You know. You know. You're out of the business. Okay. Yeah. And we want to congratulate John Tanagbe over there at She for Constantly. Month in month out. Book it and book out. Just suck in the big one at she. Okay. I mean just absolutely. With that gigantic. A hundred thousand one on the let you can hear from coast to coast all over the world practically with no audience. Nothing. You think rosefolder something. At least he's got ten or twelve listeners. At she. No, that's not how bad it is. They don't even use our patron anymore. They sent out a search for. They're like, oh, my God. And you know all those people are going to do so. She bumper sticker. They haven't listened to it in two years. No. So don't go by that stuff. Anyway, it's the twelve minutes till noon. If you're ready now to satisfy that hunger. I know a lot of people in this audience have a physical and a mental hunger. Okay. Now we try to satisfy the mental hunger by giving you a little food for thought not too much. Just a little tiny bit once in a while. Yeah. Like I'm dying over here. That you do it for this audience. But if you want to satisfy that physical hunger. Yeah. She did. I'm 50. I'm 50. We have another room. I'm not going to mention you. It's got a rumor today. But somebody from the morning show on Zeta. This is in line with that rumor that we heard earlier, which they're vigorously denying. Oh yeah. Someone is called somebody else in the business that he used to work for for a reference, which means he's looking for a job. Huh. Huh. He's an old-john provacitor. Huh. Ah, 95. Well, when they said they turned the corner man. Oh, they know that they'd be peeking out from behind that fence at that big sprawl. You express way. I want to congratulate the DOT by the way on their ingenious job. Because when I go like up to Papadot Park and you go up 95 from where I am to bedlining Boulevard, they've to get rid of the old white lines in a road. What they've done. And a lot of places they'll paint them over in black. So it blends in with the, you know, with the highway, with the tar. Not here. They scrape them off of what they do as they dig these two big ridges in the road. So now you got two huge ridges in a road. And the last two miles before you get to the Atlantic Boulevard exit. They've tard over in the right hand lane. Two thirds of the lane. So the rest of the lane is like an inch or two lower. And here are all these cars in every lane. More so than usual swarving and puking and all the sudden. Please give the top 20 12 plus numbers after the news. Thanks from Arab. We got an Arab that owns us to, I don't know, I can't read this. Arab. Whoever it is. Okay. We'll give anything you want. We'll give them some time and more the rest of our audience. Because this is our way of punishing them of getting back. That's the one we get a chance to get to the audience by punishing them with these T.D. or nothing is boring terminal numbers that are enough to make your pukier guts out and speak of that words lunch. Well, seriously, Johnny Dark is in here. One time incredibly famous radio celebrity. Well, and he has been working a long time and he's like a chip mug. You know, he's gearing up like a squirrel. That's why he's got all this weight on because he's afraid that, you know, one of these days. And we need some food in here. And I think Carmine would send food over today on our great celebratory at Tuesday. Carmine celebrating the entire IODGTR shirt for someone. Sure. So, well, I see that's a big preparation when I have to go through. They will summon wool and maybe Arnold over at the hamburger thing. Oh. See, I've got a char-hub. But char-hub is the nearest one is so far away. I don't think it's going to happen. But Arnold over there with those, uh, well, they were all over the world. Oh, that was great. We had those the other last week. Wow. And we were shocked. They were. They really were. 1154, a WND after the new news for those of you planning on tuning out, we'll be reading the top 20 in order. 12 plush. Okay. We're going to bring in boom boom to really good. We have no but lot of rower. Right. Two four WND. Here comes Sharon with more ponders numbers. Okay. I was just about to take a call and thank God you came in with these. These are 18 to 34. Oh, so I can, it's sunny five. Oh, so I can still listen to. Oh, I can. Yeah, of course. Okay. We're getting, no, that's 10 to three. We had a six one. Now, look at what it was when we came here. It was a point six. What? Alice had a point something. We already looked at a point three. I had to go at it girl. Alice almost off the air. Um, what was that looking for now? Sunny Fox and tomorrow is desperate for his 18 to 34. And that's the one Sharon didn't bring in here. So blame Sharon for not me. Oh, here it is. 6 to 10 a.m. I got it. I got it. Okay, 6 to 10 hot with a 14 six in a morning 18 to 34 GTO with a 12. I said it again bill 12. Okay. Happy how you idiot. Well, I would 100 with a seven down from an 8.8. Wow. Seven one from an 8.8 down 1.7. I'd say about a fourth. Still down 20%. Great. 18 to 34. And of course, that's the meeting potatoes of those rocky, rocky, rocky music intensive. Pinhead stations for those young, pre-pubes idiots. Right. Rindish. Yeah. They got those that donnie house been show. I think we'll put them over the top. He's out of town on the bus with the, what's it? I'm sorry. Zeta. 6 to 10 a.m. 18 to 34 from a 3 3 to a 3 8. But like we said, the two books ago when we were there at 10 5. Yeah. So they've only lost 2 thirds of that audience. Yeah. So no, one of the kernels is a desperately seeking references. Yeah. We lost your block. We lost your block. And the god only knows he'll leave it. Miami. Hello. I'm dying over here. Hold on. Come on. Rose. It's not that. Was that Tim William? No. When guys work together long enough, they start sounding alike. I mean, one more time now. I'm dying over here. Oh, that was Tim William. And we don't want to speak ill of Tim because he does have young children. And you know how you motion a leg in. What is that? Did you hear somebody cackling and laying a thing going on? Yeah. I thought that was on the phone. Is it done on the phone? What was that? That was incredible. Somebody's ghosting April in the hallway. I think you better check it out. West Palm Beach. Hello. I just called to tank around your tanko tanko. I can't talk on phone. So I'll call you later. Okay. Now let's not start that now. Okay. With the last 10 minutes of the show every day, we reserved for that. But I can't. I can't deal with a lot of them. Two older deal with four hours of that. All right. Yeah. Should we try bokeh? Because we actually got like a couple of calls on a board. They're not overwhelming, but we got a few. Bokeh. Hello. Yeah. Like I said, yeah. It's pretty grim. Well, even though anything about radio and bokeh, and if you've ever heard WSBR, Oh, like living poor in the mud. Okay. We have a bokeh line open. 278 WIOD. There it goes. And the Palm Beach line come on lean. Now I know just before you go on the air. You'd love to hear if JNO showed up. The answer is no. So I guess you don't have to call. JNO just didn't WR in F-show. A little bit like they always do like a little fraction. You know WR in F. Let's try a pinhead and broward. Hello. Hey, how are you doing, pal? Hey, congratulations on your numbers. Well, thanks so much. They don't mean much to them, but it's nice to see them in print. But I was wondering if you give me so much travel tips. I'm getting next week. I'm going on vacation. Yeah. First I'm flying to Chicago for a day. Are you going to go see the cubs? I'm like, I'm only going to be there like three hours. Well, that's good because you get really depressed if you went to WR. And then from now I'm going to California. There's one if you give me some good places that like I think I'm going to go ahead and report for like three hours. Yo, a lot of give you just enough time to change planes at O'Hare. Really? Yeah, that's a mess. That's the worst airport you just, you're probably tear your hair out at O'Hare. That's why they call it O'Hare. Some people call it no hair. And then were you going to California? Uh, Los Angeles. Los Angeles. Well, take a gas mask with you. I don't want to get you depressed before this trip. You can't read the air. The smog is so thick. You could cut it with a butter knife. Okay. But I got to that one when we stay in like four days. Yeah. Well, by the end of that time, when you come back, I know it's fine. I think they got a good unit where they give you like oxygen. You know, pure oxygen for a day or two. Other than that, have a great time. Okay. Are you going to call us from out there? I'm going to call you from Chicago. Because I think it's going to be at the same time day in this show. Excellent. And then I'll call you from LA. And no problem. You'll be able to get right through trust me. On B to a six seven. Any line? Six five five six five five six five five. Right on your sleeve. Okay. Okay. Have a great trip. Bye. Wow. Okay. We have an open line in Broward at five two four WID considering one of the broad lines is out. That's not saying an awful lot for you. Stifts up there. And we do have an open line in Palm Beach at six five five WID. Six five five. Oh, look at that. A Palm Beach call. Are you there? Are you ready to speak to us? Yeah. Well, we got to do the news. You're sure? We're not imposing on your are we? Yeah. Okay. Hold on. Not that we care. What a, you know, it's a successful life. What about Mikey? We gave Mikey's numbers, but we'll do it all again after the news. In fact, we'll do it like every 50 minutes. Kind of like the NFL draft. Okay. Every number. We'll get even with those sports people man. Every number you want to know and some I never hope you never hear again. Five one WID in day. Five two four WID in Broward. Or six five five and two seven eight. WID in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. And now here's Neil Rogers on news shot radio 610 WIOD. Okay. We got to count down those top 20 and 12 plus. But Johnny Darts says he won't really push the eye out. He shows up. Oh, you got ours looking out. Now where is the food? This is supposed to be our big ratings part. Now what a party. And even boy Gary won't complain if we get food in here today. He would go nuts. He probably eat some of it. He'd be so excited. He was yankin' on those suspenders. I thought he was going to have an accident. A radio accident. Okay. Here we go. This is 12 plus is the entire week for those of you who have no idea what this is about it. I can't lose for where we don't care. The show is basically for those push lepers in this business. Those downtrotten. Those abused. Those overused and whipped and beaten and destroyed. Poor souls who have put their entire lives into this business and gotten as a reward a slap in the face. A kick in a pants. A punch in Taukes. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We can relate to that. Because that's what we all strive for. It's to be like boom boom. And if Johnny Darts isn't going to jump pretty soon, he's going to wind up like that. Or at least get fed to the anyway. This is embarrassing. Okay. Top 20, 12 plus. Hot. And eight three. And we congratulate Keith Isle and all those other douche bags over there for this miracle. He's done with crayons, mirrors, and fish eggs. Life with a seven one. They don't count. They just do not count. What are you doing now? Are you, are you, are we light a little stub of a cigar like that? Stubb rhymes with slubb. Bob, leave me alone. Number three. Wild with a five. One. I wasn't at the first time they broken a five like since Matuzla's grandmother died. Something like that. W QBA. A five. Power from a four four to a four three. Magic. A four two bouncing back up from a three nine. A lot of the key play in purple people either though they're going to have some problems. W GTR. This is the one we really want to emphasize because spike wise and dancing the twist in the hallway. If he keeps playing those Chubby Checker records man, he never really had a drop like a rock from a two eight up to a four. They're number seven. Number eight. He's an ocean provocateur. For the three nine, we had a tie for a three nine W achy. That's radio mumbee. And waxy. Waxy was tied with radio mumbee. Wow. That is shocking. You can listen. I have a half hour point. There's absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk. That lady is a whatever. So I wanted on it on it. Okay. Number ten. Tie protects between y 100 with a three eight. And wcm Q with a three eight. Kiss. As in kiss this was 12th with a three four. Love body four gloves. You're old. You're one of your favorite radio state. Oh yeah. They all love you. Oh, man. Especially the afternoon lady. And I hope she never calls me again or leaves me a message. 13th with a three three down from a three four. But about for them. They had pretty good demos. They had a few people under 100. W News ladies and gentlemen, this deserves its own special little something. Number 14 and dropping like a dime drop from the top story of the Empire State Building. Dropping like a pebble in the Grand Canyon. W News from a listen to this summer. For eight fall three six and now in the winter time a three two. Ooh. Ooh. Mmm. Mmm. That's not things are not good at W News. Ooh. Yeah. W i n z. Three one 15. So those two are like kind of like neck and neck right together there with the tidy bull man. Number 16 W T m i for our suit of intellectuals a three. I'm not interested in the summer they had a three in the fall of two nine and now a three in. It's like there's a straight line. It's basically that same group of 15,000 average quarter hour suit of intellectuals who claimed to listen that. Classical gas or get gas while he listen to the nation Williams would say joy FM. Oh joy forever is a thing of beauty. This is a story for 17 from a four to a two seven big story. I would super acu. Yeah that's somebody QBA FM a two seven jump down. They really think they leaped off the page. Well, we believe now at Lairos which is coming up next. I'll I'll you out. W E D R 19 with a two five with that whopping signal there's look at their trend from a four five in a summer. Then the three nine a two five looks like he diesly is putting E D R to sleep in pretty peot about it. Two by the way, they're not too happy. And then of course rounding out the top 20 not to be left out. W X D J as an X. From that two four from those heady days of that fluke month that given that fall book of a two four down to a one eight. He holding up the following those briefly. She with a one seven z with a one six w a tf m with a one two followed by CM Q r h c f t l k a t with a point eight. We shouldn't leave them out because they did show up m b m Q a m with a point eight and radio swivey with a point seven. The motivation station about whom we've seen two articles this month didn't show on any page. He's got a heady demographic they didn't make it. It's a non measure of a lot of you see they got two pages and stop for the magazine how do you like that. I show you that those speakers in stop for the magazine really know the pulse of the radio market. They give him two pages and they don't have one listener okay. Except for Captain Bay. Well, the one they want to listen to maybe he'll continue to be motivated by that for the time being. So there. The anodos and show all right sure super sure didn't sure. That's because most people still can't fight it on radio. That's a fan Patrick we're still alive. They'd be doing a list of one. Trust me. All right. We'll do a little break and then we'll get to your inane calls which probably have nothing to do with any of this. It's 11 past noon at W i o d. And he says you should send one of your salespeople out. Yeah, that'll take care of it. Rich got a little thing here from rich packed here, which we appreciate. But sending one of our salespeople out. You know, follow up a lead is like sending out the Sherlock Holmes to follow a detective story. He's been dead for like, well, he was never even born. Okay. Like most of our salespeople. Okay. It's 12 14 a widay. We deeply apologize. We're so sorry that we're boring you with this stuff. And if you believe that. Okay. Steve today sex surrogates are they really therapist or are they just a bunch of cheap horrors? Okay. Are they prostitutes? God forbid. And his guest will be Merlin Volker and Reverend Rick Patterson. And as I said before, Reverend Rick, it's really nervous when he hears about any new erections in softball. So we have a little building, a moratorium. A Palm Beach is holding, right? What is the holding? Well, that's the question. Well, see, it's my fault. I forgot about your right. I guess. Yeah, see, I said we're going to get you after the news. And I was like 10 minutes later, right? True. And you're getting pretty tired of it, right? No. Okay. Not now. I just can't say if you don't do a great job. That's correct. You're kicking butt from data. Yep. You're doing better than I had to. Yeah. And we don't have to get up at 430 in a stinking morning and come in and look at ugly rose Fulger with a sour look on his face. And that alone is where the price of emission. Well, listen, is that it? Yeah. You mean you held on all that time to say something nice? Why not? Well, we'll send you a prize in a mail. Okay. Don't hold your breath. Have a great day. Thanks a lot. What a nice guy in Palm Beach, no less. Wow. Shocking and he sounded like he was under 100. He's under over to Alice Boy. He needs they are. They are like, yeah. Oh my god. In fact, I wonder if we got something in here that would kind of be fitting for them today, no? In the rack. We only got like, listen to that hollow sound there. What is that? Is Rick's clarinet, but... Ha ha ha. Is Don on a phone? Is Rick's clarinet building blind? And they haven't ever heard that hollow kind of sound. Oh. Okay. Now this really frost my ass. Okay. Look at this question on the screen. What is Steve's rating? He's interested. We didn't do hear how we just went nuts. Is he on the phone? Steve, we gave him out. You did great. We were like tinkling all over you. And I was rushing through these to get to your numbers and compare to Alice. So you just buried. All of that. We shouldn't say that after that last thing there. Steve had a 47 in 12. Plus and a 5.5 and 25.54. I think those are his highest numbers ever in his market. I could be wrong. But I don't think so. I think those are huge numbers. Way up. 39 to a 47 in 12. Plus and a 5.5 and 25.54. Alice had a 3 in 12. Plus just hovering going into the twos. Diving into the bowl with a tidy bowl man. And was it in 25 to 54 or 1.6? Oh. Steve's 5.5. So I guess we won't be getting any happy poem cards from Dennis Collins next year. Robert's about us going to Oklahoma City. Is that where we're going now? Yeah. Oklahoma City. We'll be big over there right? I have to pass this along to you. This was all in the mail. Here about that. Wait a minute. Okay. He'll get up down. Yeah. Headlines says radio host hits listener at festival. This is from the same heat times. Yeah. That's right. Not to a date line logo. Largo. Controversial radio touch a host. Bob Lasseter. Hit a 19 year old listener with the back of his hand after the man's screamed close to the microphone during a live broadcast at the Largo Renaissance Festival on Saturday, police say. On Saturday? The man, told police that he received free tickets to the festival from the last year show on WFL and he and that he screamed because I've been a regular caller on the show for the last two years. I've been asked by the producers to scream. He told police that last year seemed to recognize the scream and that after the scream last year, turn to his side and punch the man in the mouth. Wow. Wow. The artificial sleep. You got it. Wow. This is it. This is it. This well, there goes on and on and on. But that's the crux of it. He says the last year says this is a quote. I was closing my radio show when I heard a loud scream that appeared to be coming from my left rear. He's left rear. Directly in my ear. Here on Tana. As I am the frequent target of threats of physical violence, I react first asked questions later. Oh, yeah. I swung with my left arm backhanding a young man before I ever made eye contact. He was stunned and left the area. This is a last or quote. I followed the approach that I failed to find it funny advice him. What he did was actually in violation of federal law. And told him that I never wanted to see him again. Now the man gave kind of a different story. This is the man's story. Yeah, this is the rest of the story. He was still on stiffing this station. Now the guy told police somewhat different. I think the guy from maybe he didn't call in to congratulate us. What a douchebag. He put down a microphone and ran ahead of where I was walking. He began poking his index finger in my chest saying, don't ever let me see you again. If I ever see you under any different circumstances, I will beat the hell out of you. I happened to be in my car at the time. Last year was ending his live broadcast. The festival manager heard loud screams. All I could say is I heard the loud scream. Over there, police are still investigating this incredible shocking. Well, there's a story. You know the real reason he hit him. He's an orange on Provaq. That's the real story. 20 minutes passed. No, the story is the stuff. Don't throw that thing out there with that picture. That guy wants to be your son. When I go on vacation, I'm here. He's got a long letter. Of course, the only problem is he doesn't sign it. Yes, he does. Oh, here is name in all his vial. Oh, which is celebrity. It's a celebrity. He's a celebrity. Is there nothing in there with a name? So how to hell with we ever get in touch with him? I don't think it's all I have. You have his thing? I have his thing. I have he. I want you to relinquish his thing. I have his resume. Now that's shocking, okay? Shocking. What is this guy's name? He looks a little bit on the lantern side. I don't know who this is. But he wants he'd like to come in while I'm on vacation. Or better yet. So it's not supposed to be threat to the bird. And since he's already gamefully employed, you might consider me to keep you company. If that Saturday gig comes through. You got it, baby. You got it. Wait a minute. Here's a motivation radio listener. We got the bulletin sounded is to minute. Hello. Hello, Neil. How are you doing? Okay. Hey, bird. Are you? Okay. You're the one. I actually listen to it. Maybe your self-staff could also listen to it. Might help them be a bit better in terms of the. Hey, listen. It couldn't hurt. You know what I'm saying? Couldn't hurt. I'm on the road a lot. Actually, I'm in chemical sales. And I find if I listen to it sometimes it helps. They have a lot of garbage. So there's other stations. But they can't give me going every now and then. Yeah. Works for me like a John boy. Well, I'm the only listener. So another good thing. Is that you don't have a whole lot of commercials. Yeah. I like that. To affect Zeta was right on the break. For rehearsal free radio. Now after seeing his book, I think he's going to be several stations. You're going to be delving into that. You know, dabbling with commercial free pretty soon. I can understand. I can understand. I can understand. Try to get yourself forced with the two over there. And maybe they might help you guys out. Okay. Or maybe they might even get hired over there. I think they'd fit right in if they got no spots. Actually, I'd like to get the job over it. She would be a big signal over there. We get some good people. Yeah. And then I help them out. Okay. Just take a lot of defensive equipment over there. It's an ugly, a likes to chase. Okay. Occasionally like with a ball-peen hammer. You know that kind of stuff. All right, Neil. Okay. Good luck, John. Thank you. Bye-bye. Okay. So, in a WIOD, an open line is in Palm Beach. Hey, we've actually had a few living and breathing people in Palm Beach. And where the hell is that food by the way? Uh-oh. We are getting pretty early about this. Or line up with a 7-3 with an 8-6 and 25-54. And we're all these people that love us and tinkle all over us. And I'm not joking today. We got a celebrity here who's starving that has eaten in two weeks. And we can't even drum up a couple of burgers or something. Wow. A little pizza. Nothing. Come on now. Just out. We're going to be humiliating, degrading, and embarrassing. Doesn't look good. Wow. Sorry, John. They just don't care. Like I said, they don't give it in. 23 after no WIOD. And speaking of that, let's tell you about nutrition system. Well, this could be a blessing of the skies for Johnny Dark. This could be kind of unwittingly the beginning of his new-trust system career. And he. Oh, is that what he's doing tomorrow? He's looking for a job. 27 past noon at WIOD. And we got a couple of low-goth-three lines open up again. They're just not really into it today. And on I, I admitted the beginning, I told him all he had lost. And they did. One thing about this audience, man, or obedient. But like goes on, we just keep going along with the build-up to the Steve Canes Show. Today, Marilyn Folker, Reverend Rick Patterson, the topic will be sexier against therapists or prostitutes. And then a Maristie is going to be doing professional guests. Are they prostitutes? I love those professional guests. I still can't get over those two guests list that we've got. Boy, those were the days. You want your child to become a super-kid list of this afternoon, to the Steve Canes Show is parenting expert Michael Dacisto. We have met him as long as we've been here. It's a nice guy. I'm sure he's a good guy, but enough is enough. Yeah. And then Sharon gave me this thing a brave new world of love potions. It says daily use for two weeks brings firmer, longer lasting erections, and an increased ability to achieve orgasm. Really? Belimics will be more not to use the drug because of dangerous side effects. Hmm. Green Oats, metal extract and vitamin C are the ingredients of ex-stavia, a non-prescription drug from Switzerland. Ex-mintaken powder and juicer water in a study reported a significantly higher increase in sexual desire, as well as firmer and longer lasting erections. Women reported no benefits, although Bill, what was his name? Bill. The guy who was a girl. Oh. Get tipped in. Said that it was okay by him. He's 29 at WI-O-D. Here's a call from Atlanta. Hello. How you doing, Neil? Okay. I tried to call the brand, man. I almost had 20 minutes. Nobody answered the phone. What are you doing up there? Roofing. I called you back when. Oh yeah, this is roof is up in Atlanta. Roofing. He must be related to Muffin up there in Palm Beach. Well, I'm dead. Middle Muffin. When all you got up here is let no porch to listen to.

Oh, no, you're going to get on the bed right now. You know what I think you are, sir? He's an ozone provocateur. We have enough trouble just to keep it a under arrest on hero. We have enough problems here. Well, I guess you didn't hear about those great ratings that just came out. Oh, well, I might just go down the whole list. Yeah. We've already done this to the point of nausea. We had a 73-serer. We were just to kick the ass. And in 25 to 54, we had an 86. We were number one in the food just came in. I'd be like that. We got a little pizza here from Flores. Thank you, Carman. You're a wonderful human being. And here's a little load from Lynn. Isn't that great? Boy, I'll tell you everything. Just falling into place today, sir. It's terrific. It's almost worth being alive. Let me do some right after. Okay. Well, listen, say hi to all our local friends up there at WSB. Okay.

So it's one of those assholstered to pick it. So that it, thanks a lot, Joe. We just want to know that, oh, I see. It's just like a blank. He named it right our name. Thanks a lot, Joe. Thanks for the food, Flores. This is, look at that pizza. Boy, that's just with the plain cheese. We ended up in there. Well, look at some napkins. Don't start hyperventilating, okay? Don't go nuts. Is this guy still here by the way? I'm dying over here. Okay. We loved him on hold so long. I can't say that I blame him. It's 1231, a WIO dude. I was at Line 6, working again. I think I saw it, do a little, no? Well, I get nervous. You know, when we have lines that are blank, let's take a call. Here's Lee Roy, my name. How you doing Lee Roy? No, no, no. Yes, sir. Okay, possibly Roy. Lee Roy, Lee Roy, B, you may not remember me. Lee Roy, B, are you related to Willi B? I'm one of the people. You're a woman, B, B, B, B.

Ray, call you and tell your techno time, Joe. Just gone already. I haven't even made a move for it yet. That's right. Wow, what a bunch of maniacs in here. It's great. We give you just one piece. I don't know what's great. It's that plain cheese from the florism or gasmicover. Look at the side of those pieces. Can I see we didn't let you down, John. John was getting really distraught and upset. And a little apple plucked to him, my dad. Oh, that's right. Oh, that was awesome. I'm sorry. You can't be here to share it with us, pal. Oh, we've got chills up here now. Well, that's great. So up there and just pick out, okay? Hold on now. I know what he's really thinking up there. I'm dying over here. Okay. Yeah, 12. 1233. That's what there's all singing. They got a little chorus singing over WOLD. They're all singing at some point. And as they, well, data is already past tense. I'm 95. 90% here it now. I can already hear it. Okay, Kasia messed the stories in the vutin in late. The big radio news that everybody's buzzing about. I said buzzing about. He's Steve. What was his name, pickleoni? Forum. Forum. Steve, Forum. The four-year-old program director WOLD is can he's out. He's audio-see. It took them to depths that are just frightening. And I'm sure some of you boxes are really upset about that. How come Sunny hadn't called us on the air today? I mean, I don't want to beg, but I would think he'd probably be loading. We need to hold a number. Do you want to trickle a while? Clem wants to speak. Oh, you want to speak to your buddy again? Yeah. Are you there with us? Oh, yeah. Hey, hey. I don't cry. I mean, I don't cry. I mean, I don't cry. I don't cry. I don't cry. Oh, no. Yeah. I found Gory. I've never blew here bright to God. That's right. Ha, ha, ha, ha. The few is 95 and a half. You need to die. Really? That's right. That's right. Hey, why don't you call me correct, man? I don't do that. I'll listen. I'll go get you. All right, I'll call you correct. I don't work. All right. Get off me or fall. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm a bit sad. I can't say. I don't have my mug. Ha, ha, ha. Wow. They're good together. All right. Thanks. In fact, pretty soon. I have that show on a weekend at WOLD. I think they can have a show on a weekend here. I don't know what I'm. Anybody could have a show on a weekend here. We don't want to get into that. Do we? Because things are just too positive. You know, we don't want to throw any monkey wrenches into the works. Well, I'm personally kind of upset about Gary Noon. And don't forget, you know, the rumors were before the big draft show Sunday. So, oh, no, no, no, we could be doing a funny here now. I didn't want to stay out. Oh, yeah. To me, that kind of like put us over the top. We're apologizing for eating on the air here because we know it's bad radio, but we don't give a good fly in. We're not going to get a fuck up. Because I told Boigyere yesterday, you know, the bus to Louisville leaves in about a half an hour. And he knows it too. He's got the schedule on. All right, listen, this Saturday we're going to be doing something. Really speaking about that thing, you old D. You know what I mean? Okay, 1239 at WID. Aren't you going to take this pizza? We desperately want you to have it. Oh, Nick's going to get it for you. Boy. Wow. He's shy. I don't understand it. What, what did we do? I don't know. Okay, so Johnny's going to give me a diet soda and one is way out. Are you really? That would be great because my diet Pepsi here is just about out. Okay, 21 to one at WID. We're having our little ratings party anytime. We've got two mouths to feed there, so we've got to take care of him. And we just, everybody in the station did great. Well, we're nearly did great. We did incredible Steve Grimmongus sensational. Now. Well, now, you know, we're almost in building a day. Isn't that what Boigyere said? He's a give us 20 or 30 years. You know what else Boigyere said? Okay, let's take a call from Hollywood. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Hey, hey, don't get a big report for you. Okay. The four-letter of police in the morning to speed treps set up from now. Probably for the next couple of days. I got caught at the first one. And as I got out, there were two others on my way to work. Hmm. But I'd like to call the city a four-letter of police department a bunch of stuff. Human, moronic, two-spec, asshole. Where was this? This was on Broward and they had one on sixth street. And I also heard of somebody told me there was one on 19th street. Isn't that great? Well, it probably is toward the end of the month. They're down on their quota, yeah. Exactly. The little bit, the ticket was already printed out with the judges. And the troopers name and his badge. And the speed, yeah. Yeah. Well, there must have been- I'm not surprised. People would be careful coming to work. Must have been your lucky day. Okay. Thanks a lot, pal. No problem. Bye. Okay. I don't know what just happened. People dropped off immediately. Well, we don't care. We're eating. We're having a good time. We're basking in the glory of those numbers, which by tomorrow will be ancient history. Now, do we have like a little note or a memo that said, incredible job? You mean like they got after the draft show, something like that? Yeah. That said, this was a radio, but it's finest. It's shining our, et cetera. I haven't seen it. What an incredible humongous, phenomenal, unbelievable. Et cetera. I don't think so. I mean, we might still. I'd down it. Hmm. Wow. Well, that was really great. See, we didn't let you down, Johnny. We came through for you. So the news is, Johnny is alive and safe for at least one more day. Right? Here's a mobile and Palm Beach, hello. Neil Bird. Yes sir. Better supply to say, tank old tanko. Yes sir. Great rings. Let's think of one thing that's good. It's an ocean for bucket tourners like, soup to your, something. He's an ocean provocateur. Yeah. You'd have to ask gold, cuck in western Dick fatherly. Well, let's go. In between those Willie Nelson records on QAM. One more thing. I'm only concerned about one thing for you in verse. What is that? The higher your ratings get and I'll tell you, get much higher. That's a B third year for you. The closer you guys get to the door. You're going to be okay this time, right? I mean, the closer we get to the door. Yeah, the no brain management usually gets nervous when you're reading your two high and they can. Now one good thing about here, they're always nervous. It doesn't make any difference. Good. Did you say it's sound for a while? Yeah. We're not going anywhere. What about what Dennis Collins says? What does he know? Not much. That's obvious by the numbers. You guys are a great day. Best luck to all you don't need it. Thanks a lot. 1242 at Wild. We have an open line in Palm Beach at 655 Wild. And what did Broward now? 524Wild. 5249463. On a mindless, moronic idiotic, douchebag show. So this is why we're at the time. Right foot, just the way we like it. What a perfect reflection of America, okay? By the way, I'm still planning out my vacation. It's still in limbo. I got like three or four different, I mean, I got a basic tentative thing set up. But I always look into some of these books now. Amsterdam. Everybody tells me how great it is. You know, it had wonderful time. Yeah. But I always look into this one Broward's book. And it looked like all the people like the 60s all over again. It looked like all these burnout washed out. Hippie's, grow test, mung, non-basing. Is that what it is? Where have you been there? Yeah. No. Nobody hears me. You know what I'm seeing? Well, I don't care. You're seeing that I've seen a lot on TV too, but actually being there getting the feel of it is another stirring. You know what I mean? That's what TV Kate said. Yeah, see, I've seen TV on TV. Well, wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen, we have another Ojoan Provoca tour online for. Well, what can I tell you? Another radio trouble maker. Other unemployed radio. Too bad you weren't here today. You would have loved the pizza. Well, the ratings are just phenomenal. I'm thinking. And that in 40 cents will buy us a water recap of coffee. Oh, huh. Okay, on the beach. Congratulations, bird. Thank you, Stan. Congratulations, Uncle Neil. And it's just, it's incredible. I know. I mean, it's shocking. Incredible. Thank you. Think of what it would be if you got that hot, you know, got rid of that hot 2 to 3 hour. Now, come on now. Don't start that all in, you have a point. Yeah, it's funny because Steve said yesterday that he's a little, you know, with the disease to get in here at the 6 to 7 hour sports stock. Oh, yeah, right. And I didn't want to stick a Steve, you know, it was doing very well. I don't want to say, well, we inherit your 2 to 3 hour. Because he would have taken that the wrong way. You know, Steve is so fragile. But you can do this exact same thing, Stan. You just have to take that 6 to 7 news out. And we used to have to inherit your mediocre cook. Okay. So it goes around. See, comes around. Congratulations. Thank you, Stan. It's pretty phenomenal. What did wins do in my old times, lock? Oh, wow. We're going to have good. Okay. Look at that paper with all that pizza on it. Oh, boy. I just take that. I think they went way up to a 2-1 something like that. Just a minute now, don't start high-preventalating on us. 3 to 7. Well, we got 25 to 54. That was your strong use to have like a 4's and 5. 4's got 5's. Well, let's take a look here. WI and Z. I'm on the second page. I don't see him. Here they got a 2 on in 25 to 54. They went up from a 1-9. So they really turned a corner. Yeah. Right. And 12 plus and afternoons were used to have like 4's and 5's. They did on the not the second page. On the third page, 2-5. So they've lost half the audience, I would say. Yep. Well, they're obviously very happy with what they've got. Did you hear the rumors about Zeta? Yeah, that's interesting. I mean, all these I-95 pins. I've got around the house here. It's going to be worth something. I think so. I think so. Are you practicing Stan? I. 95. Yeah. If you work on it, they might get you right in or do all the voices. But I'm not going to have any live Jocks. Of course, that's a lot different from what they got now. But can I get the crayon franchise for the new PD? Boy, I'm telling you, this is Lea's just going nuts, isn't it? And of course, he's another. You remember that article? Who was it, Jika wrote it about all the talent that the guy gented his let's look at your fingers? Yeah. Well, it's a classic example there. Yep. Well, along with some of the rest of us. Yes, right. Well, well, it's great Neil. Have a lot of fun. Thank you. Fantastic. Talk to you later. Do you have any of the male demographics in your time slot yet? No. You don't? No, but the book will be in the couple of days. We don't want to shoot the thing all in one day. I bet you imagine what you're what you're really. Men 25 to 54, we must have like a 15 share. I've got a share. It's got to be. How it out of these women? If we had women like we got men, got on those. What kind of number? We'll have them. I'll show you. I get the women for you. Like I said. See you. Oh. Wow. Boy, what a day. Well, see, stand doesn't terrorize the women as much as he used to. Another is married and he's got his little baby and he more like kind of domestic. Much more. Remember in the beginning, I and he's had those women just terrified. Well, here it was. Wild. And I guess with good reason. Okay, it's 1246 to WID. We have an open line in Palm Beach 655 Wild 6559463. We're still waiting for our congratulatory call from Majad Paccato with WGNO. Where we got that yet? No, no, yes. He's probably had it. Yeah, we've had a lot of action on it. Lies probably had trouble getting the hit. So we'll try to keep that line open for you so that the John Paccato can get through from JNO. Congratulations. I started shing the shocking demographics and great numbers here at Wild. Welcome to Wild. Boka, hello. John? Congratulations. Thank you, John. We're expecting you on a vocal line. Where are you? Your metamorphance around the way Niel. Yeah, okay. Well, that was nice, John, to call us. That was real nice. Okay, what kind of dwindling down on calls here today? But that's all right. We understand. Try to even things out a little bit. Boy, this is this salad. You can eat this for hours, you know? And you use that one. You can't really rock because it's bad radio. And I wish we could do. I bet you we could do a 20-year-old. We could do quality radio like Sunday. And it's best. And it's best. Two memos that will live in the Aynals or broadcast history. They will hang those side by side in the Smithsonian Institute. The broadcast museum along the program director who wrote them. How to get an institute right now. You're going to spray check it. Wow. You know, see how those suspenders back on again today? And he brought in the cigars and the champagne. Just acted like he knew what planet he was off. And he's got that little thing he wears on a back of his shirt. It says, which way do Louisville have a question mark? Some of us are getting about ready to show him that right now he's a good guy. He really, look at he got our CD player. Which we ought to start using. See, I feel guilty because we wasted a lot of time. We've screwed around today. We've been selfish. We've had to show it to ourselves. Or that's only because nobody wants to call. But it's true. But I think we ought to play a lot more music here. Don't you? Now, have you heard any of the music on the air? You certainly must have. Is it sound okay? It does. It's hard to tell in here because I want to speak reason. It's purposely, they see. So we don't get the high so it doesn't keep back. You understand that? There are. You ought to have a lot of highs in the building. Most of them in the newsroom when they hear it. Let me just see if there's anything in here. By the way, I want to show you something. Don't ever get CDs. This is a set. These have got all. Oh God, I'm going to blow my brains out. Why do you hold these collectors out there? Don't go get carried away in a by the whole bunch of a new series until you listen to one. And make sure that it sounds even remotely like the original ones. Okay? Even just remotely. Like I'd say that where it sounds remotely like you've heard something like that before. But you don't know what the name of the song is. Yes. What does that mean? What does that mean? The acid casualty t-shirts. What does that mean? I mean, I know they got one guy in the show who's an acid casualty. These are good guys. He's our buddy. Well, at least till today he was. And then tomorrow he's doing what? He's doing a park.

I got numbers here that haven't been invented yet for stations that aren't on the air anymore. Yeah. I wonder what would happen if all those monitors that are out there got a diary. Would they be realistic to put you down or what? Well, for all we know they may have. So we might be doing a 20 share for all we know. Yeah, right. You never know. Yeah. I haven't heard about our favorite afternoon radio personality. Irene Richard. Oh, Irene. Well, Irene. Let's see. Now, she didn't do too bad. She had a 3 8 and 12 in the 12 plus. No way, to me. That was up from a 3 6. That's not so bad. Then in 25 to 54, what did I say? Because I don't want to have to look through all this again. We already, Johnny, and I looked that up somewhere here. It was just a lot of problems. I'll look it up. Okay. You guys being because I got like pages and pages. I don't know what pages. There's a lot of problems. Is she really? Wow. I think you created most of them. Okay. All right. Let's see. Oh, you are so brutal. Don't let's hit a hymn, Sarah. Just sour great. Love was Homer. All those former gloves personality, man. They just get all bent out of shape and then you don't listen show up on ratings day again. Do you notice he wasn't there this morning again? Well, the ratings went down. He's always been flat. Yeah. We're talking about the ratings. Oh, ratings. Oh, I'll look him up during the news. And we'll have him for you right in the big one to two hours. Okay. Have a good one. Okay. Well, while we're searching, we're going to see practically for Irene's listeners like our love. We're going to pause now to course April War, them who hasn't got any idea what this is all about, but it's having a good time with anyway. She got the, oh, here it is. 25 to 54. We do a real quick now. 5, 5, 2, not bad. Our ring good job. We'll be back at 105. It's so wonderful to see you out. Well, that's easy for you to say. Okay. 105 at W.I.D. It's the winner book is by the way, Andrew Reese from Jules are by us. I did get that little thing. And I appreciate it. And it was great. Thank you very much. What a day, huh? Said big one to two are today. All applauded in the hallway. They patch you on a back and say incredible job. Unbelievable. Keep up the great work. Nobody talked to you. Well, even Phil. I see. Although, probably all up to their big executive lunches now. Planning all the gifts that they're going to get quiet out there. Here's a call from chronic productions. This must be one of our inside people here. Hello. Good morning. Good afternoon. We just want to watch and graduate you guys from Miami Lake's Tech and Conic production. Well, thank you. We couldn't have done it without your stuff. Well, right. We'll have to, you know, we'll have to see you guys right throughout the day. So you don't have to wait a minute. I'm just quite quiet just coming in here. You don't have to do it with this thing. Here's a finger for us, Mike. Yeah. Get out of here. Get out of here. By the way, GGR had a fluke book by the way. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You believe this bike was coming out? Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. You believe this bike was coming out. Yeah, bring some archamp paint, okay. I think he already drank it off. So anyway, anyway, we don't, you know, we don't pay for a book. And the only way to get the numbers is through you. Where I want to see you get a sum of those 18 to 34 or her own numbers. Overall. Yeah. Well, you mean like, uh, you're going to give us where's not smooth. You mean for like the week, right? No, they're going to be a bit. But I mean, like for the whole week, that don't start testing my patients as they say in my doctor's office. 18 to 34. Let's see. Those are on these strange little light pages. Okay. You want 18 to 34 or six? I got 18. In what morning? Oh, no. Overall, well, I'm going to start getting really upset. Okay. Here we go. Seven of them at night. I can't find it. Here it is. I finally got it. Well, we got 400 things here. Hot 14.9. I know. GTR 10.7. No reaction. A power 7.5. No. Gloves. Gloves. Oh, gloves 90. No, you're acting in the other room, believe me. Are they really? I hear it. And if they, you know, make about two or four feet in between each other, they probably will love it. 1194, 5.6. What 100? 5.4. Ever, XC2. Wax, so you have to have it at a five. Even that's so easy. A while. XTJ, if I keep reading, we'll have to be the end of the show before we get to that. Here's magic. They're not on the second page. They're on the third page. They went from a four seven to a two five and 18 to 34 is on WX. Oh, FF. Good. I'm a radar. I just gave you that. You see, you've got to be real quick. 3A. But Zeta's like Zeta's basically history, and I'm saying. And what do you guys do? Overall. 18 to 34. You mean the station? Yeah. WIO, D18 to 34 probably did too much. We had a 6-1, 10-3. But WIO, D18 to 34. I can't imagine it was much of any number. Let me see. WIO, do you want to do this? Is it on here anywhere? It's not for a number. It's for a sheet. It's got to be. Yes, 3-1. It's not so bad. Testupations. One more. And that's it. OK. I'm falling asleep now. Afternoon and tonight, they came to 34 for GTR. For GTR, boy, this is a pretty intensive call here. Let's see. 3-7-PM WGTR 18 to 34. I had 11 share up from a 7-6 and a night 7-Middy WGTR had a 7-3. OK. Alright, I like that 11. See ya. Take care. Bye. OK, here's some facts stuff now. And this is the Lexington Stakes at Kiemland. Who do you like it says? This is going to be on 45-PM on ESPN on the Lexington Stakes. Got a chance to pick a horse here today. We already picked it, Hailea. This, of course, is at Kiemland. Kiemland is the only track in America that does not have a track announcer. Track in that field. They don't. They just run the races. They're no track announcer at all. They just sign it. But of course Dave Johnson does it on television. But let's see. Foxy reality with Randy Romero. Charlie Barley with Robin Plants. I'm picking Charlie Barley. OK, like the name, and I like Robin Plants. You can add in Jockey. Dettinated. Which is kind of like, what's that word again? What is it? Dettinated? No, that word we were using earlier. Oh, Delima. Delima. I better write that down. I can't remember. I would Donald Trump field dispersal with Chris Antleo. Gina Chris Antleo is the hottest Jockey in the country's burning them up in New York. He's had a winning race every day for 59 days in a row. He's won a race. The old record was 29. Even money in a morning line dispersal. That's your kind. Uh-huh. Notation with Pat De America's friend with early fires. Magisties in with Craig Perrette and Bayonic Prospect with Hasinto Vesquez. Dispersal. Yeah. OK. He's gone with the even money chalk. It'll be another frosty dystoman for 240. So take about 40,000 in Plung for Brains. All the bridge jumpers can put on this one. This personal with Chris Antleo. Even money. Who probably went. But I'm going with Charlie Barley with Robin Stanton. Stanton. Stanton. Stanton. Stanton. Stanton. Stanton. And it's even got the racing form here. Look at that. Which you can't read. But it's exciting. Charlie Barley. What is last start? But you could go blind try to read this on a facts machine. The money has been in the money five out of this. Dispersal is the one you picked. Yeah. He's one three out of four. And the last time he was second by haphalanck. Drifted out. It says. OK. Well, anyway, we don't want to hear you. I don't think those are that bad. They may have not used them, but they're not that bad. The quality isn't that great, but they're not that bad. We like them. They're not like the W. Snoozyingals. Those are probably great, but we don't have, we don't have, but we don't have any where to plan. We've got nothing to do anything here. We don't have any real real in here. He will imagine what number we could have if this were a real radio station. Yeah, no real, the real. Wow. You're going nuts now, are you getting out of control? We're going here too. We've got a CD player. We got overhead speakers. We got a triple deck cart machine down there. And you want a real real in here, make it like a real radio station. Cut it out. We like to get the competition. A little handy, crap anywhere. All right. We do have what open line in date County. I don't know what the hell's going on in date because they're taking a little C.S. To none. I don't think anybody south of what's like the demarcation. South of 79.3. Nobody speaks English in date County. They're just up to going on. They do take C.S. to south of 79. Street every day from noon to two. Did you know that in date County? Well, I guess it starts here in this building. They start a friend. Hollywood, hello. Hello. Yes. Yes, man. Hi, Neil. I burned some. You're rating. Thank you. You got a terrific job. I've been listening about a year and a half now. And I've enjoyed every second. I'm on the road. Why would you like to say the same? I've been traveling on the road. I'm a tabling nurse. And unfortunately, for the past couple months, I haven't been able to listen to your show because I bought an M.G. And radio won't turn to AM. Oh, my God. When you take it back where you bought it and tell them to get him straightened out a rail. It's a big thing it today. So I can get the listen to you tomorrow. Thank God. But continued six months on a great show. And I really do enjoy it. Thanks a lot. Okay. Have a great day. Bye. She was nice. One thing. Very nice. What happened? What a terrible problem. I never heard of such a thing. No, AM God. FM is obsolete. And that can't work. Hello. Oh, he first came over here. I love it. The day that Alice remember we having that little thing back and forth. Oh, sure. And I had a tune into Alice which took years off my life. And he was whining like he always said, Oh, I wonder he says, FM is dead. And then he's at AM and it's at AM. Yeah. Well, I mean, I may wiggle wobble as let's Cooper would say on that particular thing. But one thing we know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that W. Snooze is dead. Okay. I mean, he's number is proven beyond a shadow of a doubt. Can there be any question at all? No. There is a question. We have here today out of the new and choir. We have a little poll that was taken and doing. And Oprah, a lot of people in this building have a little poll. Oprah is the runaway favorite of And the only favorite of choir readers when it comes to talk show host. She is number one. She got 44.4% of the votes more than double the second place, which of course is Rush Limbo, Haraldo. Oh, my God. I'm going to tell you America's not well tonight. Yeah. This is really a Sally Jesse was third with 15% Phil Donahue, long regard to the top dog of talk show host place in this place. And you want to know what they say about Donahue. He's an Ojo for that good tour. And TV motormouth Morton Downey Jr. was fifth. And in last place, ladies, can we have a drum roll? Well, I don't have a drum roll in there, but I think you're like this better. I don't know. Perfect. Larry King. Oh, yeah. Larry King. Oh, yeah. Larry King. He was the Wacker Twist and Larry of course used to be on his station when it was the W.C.K.R. He all black were on the radio. See how it all ties together. It's unbelievable, isn't it? The Wacker Twist. Yeah. They're everything. Yeah. You think about it. Like worth, hello. This is John Fakano. Oh, sound like John was about ready to hit the bottom of the bowler, didn't it? Okay. We have an open line. Look at that. The same time they dropped off like in tandem. Two seven eight WOD and Boca even veg didn't call today to congratulate us on a ready shot. You know, all you chronic like Paul Harvey at least. I can't say much for him because he really opinion he asked. But at least today he called in the book came out and he had the common decent cedar. You know, deflect his own egotistical ego maniacal crap and you know, have a little something with it to say about us, okay? Yeah. But the rest of these professional, psychophantic, moronic, douchebag, subhuman, whatever they are. You know, they won't do that. Well, Cox did call in. Oh, yeah. I forgot about him. Yeah. Okay. It's ready. I'm thinking of playing at Bazaar enough. I got it. Don't panic. It's not yet. We don't want anybody on the line. He could nervous. For a lot of Dale. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. I wanted to thank you before I give you my little fiery parr. I just had an incredible out of radio experience at about one o'clock. You had a low delay. Auto erotic experience. There was no delay and I was freaking out and I'm like, God, I hope Neil picks up on me first. So I can tell him before he was dead. Coming out of the one o'clock news. Yeah. And then just real gradually. Like, oh, there's a one second delay. And then there's the two second delay. It's like on, I was on the right. Well, yes. What? That's how it works. Really? Kind of like builds up. Like other things. Yeah. Kind of builds up to a Christian. Right. Mactic. And then in your case, it's kind of Peter's out. Yeah. I just wanted to call and give you the great news. You're going to be spinning around like a cradle in about three seconds. So get ready to light your cigar back up. Um. Cliff. Only all is retiring from the weekly news. Effective this week. He's moving to one. Washington. Are you serious? Yeah. Wow. So the weekly news is that. Well, any can listen to Howard Stern, sure. And Washington, right? Right. Oh. This will be a good experience for him all around. Yeah. Good learning experience. His last at a toilet is going to be in tomorrow's issue. And he says he's going to rip everybody that's ever written him. So your name will probably be in there. He'll now wonderful. I hope he spelled it right. I hope so too. Cause remember what goes around. Come to round. You to so to speak. Can you give me a buzz before I go? Well, it all depends on what you have. You take your nails here. Huh. Well, what are actually going to get buzzed, okay? Yeah. I know. Well, this has really been a day. We've had more news. Rumors and stories this today. Yeah. Right. We've been beginning. Remember right in the beginning? Oh, the first thing is up. And then we had what was that? Dennis Reese. Yes. Absolutely. I, you know what? I really missed out. I should have thought of it. Then when he got into that rumor, he was shocked that I didn't know where the screamer ate the microphone. I wanted to ask him about that night at old by 95 when he had all those kids in their underwear in the studio. Because I keep telling you about it. A lot of people think I'm making it up. Or I was wishful thinking. Yeah. And it's a true story. Well, a Metro police came and chased everybody there. I'm sure he'll call back a couple of days. And we were pretty peot about it too. Okay. I was getting to look pretty interested. Oh, excuse me. You got to come. Oh, this is what we're doing. We got the end of that radio, okay? We only got an 86 and 25 to 50. We're only number one, but it's bad radio. See, what you understand, boy Gary, is that in this market, bad radio is good radio. It's like the kids they said, what I was really bad. I mean, it was good. Okay. So if he said, maybe wait a minute. Maybe he's talking kid talk. Okay. He said it was bad radio. It is boy Gary. It's just done. I mean, he's given us a stick in compliment. Okay. So man, that was bad. And when he said the other thing was really good, he meant it's so. Now I'm beginning to understand his kid. Okay. See, when you got like a four year old program director, you've got to learn a little bit of a little generation gap there. We weren't even thinking. Like about 42 years. Okay. Here's a constant comment. I'm sure about our male callers. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes. Hi, Kathy. I have a recheck from Nazareth College for women. Is that ring any bill? In Rochester. No, no. No, Nazareth College is who? In Kalamazoo. Well, if you say so, I don't know. It's been a rough life. And I get them confused. All right. Congratulations by the way, and you're rating. Thank you, Kathy. We do care. Well, a few. Yeah. Kira enough to send their very best. I'm finding, though, a lot of your male listeners. As soon as they say, oh, yeah, I listened to Neil Rogers. He's great. They have to issue it this way, more. They say, I mean, I'm not going to anything, mind you. Oh, yeah. And as soon as they say that, you know what that means. Yeah. That means that they're, you know, we're in pues underwear. I think so. Yeah. Very insecure, at least. Exactly. And so, I think, I think, you know, we're going to see part of that. Now, my audience is used to that, because I've been out of the closet for almost 13 years on here. So it's not a big deal. But there's a certain segment of the people across over Steve Kain audience. His guys are very insecure. Okay. So like when he does these shows about the guy breastfeeding and about all these other weird things that see gets in his, his guys call up and they want to be like patted on the head and reassured that they're okay. They want to make sure that they would never do any of these things. They wouldn't make sure. And the amazing part of it is, if you listen closely, you can tell they're usually calling us out. And the thing is, we're going to have to go through the doors together on the phone, which tells me a lot. I think so. Anyway, good luck, keep that keep up the good work, we really do do do do do do do do do do do do. Thanks, yeah. You have a good one. Thank you. Bye. Oh, yeah. I'm on the show, but of course, I'm afraid. Just like a lot of guys in a business who are always, you know, sure. I'm 26 at WIOD. And there's no discussion of situations of events of social problems or anything else. It's just a fucking free. You don't have the bad part at 0, that's me. On 27, you WIOD, we have an opening in Broward now, which is pretty shocking. Broward's been pretty mediocre today. I got it. It's not something it makes too much difference. Broward's been very, very fair weather today. Five, two, four, WIOD, five, two, four, nine, four, six, three. Probably a lot of the list is in Broward, a busy standing across the lake across from my house. I'm going to see if my satellite dish is to let their hand over their eyebrow. I want that. What is that over there and running all around you know, little circle? Wow. Because that's my philosophy. When in question, or in doubt, what in circles? I like that. Five, George. Let's go to Miami. Hello. I'm still bird-awaried. Okay pal. I'm not sure. Nothing. I don't think it's happening yet. Yeah. Neil. Nothing on this end either. I'm going to ask you for something. Could you play that? I know I'd like to be quick and. Let me tell you something. You sound desperate enough. What is it that you want? Michael Titan song. Oh, I didn't know why. That's not really a song. It's something we're song, but it doesn't really sing. We can debate it while I'm looking for it. We can debate it as long as it a bit as it a comedy thing. It's something. It's something. It's something. Well, I said a machine right now. How do you like that? Oh, that's great. And I would congratulate you guys on the rating of your show. I love your show here. Thanks. And you even admitted, right? Yeah. I'm spite of what all your friends say. Nice. We love it. And before I go in, can you vote and. And vote me off. That's that. Let me just say this to you. Okay. The card is in a machine. I've hate for you to lose you. I'm saying. You got me to do something I almost never do. And now it's like you're backing out of it. I'm like, when in a lottery and then burning the ticket, you know? It's just that that's bad radio. I know. Well, but bad is good. Yeah. And this is going to bad call, believe me. He'll okay. Thank you. Well, congratulations, Mr. Kane. We've done it again. A miracle. Okay. I didn't want to miss you. You know, I am so upset with you. I gave you a number so many times. I give it. And though. Yeah. What's it? Over. Excuse us. When the book comes out, you don't have time to be running around. Yeah. It's priority. Okay. Come on. Get it. 25 to 54. Wild. The Steve Kane show. Number three in a market with a five five. Your highest ever. In 25 to 54. Alice, not on the second page. Barely made it to the third page. It's a very bottom with a one six. His lowest ever. And he's got a half times. He's 25 to 54 number. And of course, in 12 plus and he have no new head of 47, which I think is your highest number. And Alice had a three. So he's right on the edge of dipping into the twos. I'm about three. Well, the interesting part of it is now listen to that. You're joking. But three. See, when the 35 to 64 scheme and I said finally something Dennis Collins can get excited about. But unfortunately, just didn't materialize. What you know what that means. That means they're all 65 plus. The 35 to 64. For example, what do we have? We had a seven eight midday. Sandy. Oh, Sandy, man. She just disappeared from the face. There she not even on the third page. Sandy, are you on here at all? Let me look again. That was on a fair. Sandy. 30, five to 64. We had a seven eight. Sandy had a two five. Who had a five seven and Alice had. Not on the second page. A two two. Two. 35 to 64. So obviously virtually all of their audiences over 65. What little they got because they've only got what do they have a three one. We had a five one. They had a three two and wins out of three one. But like it's not just the 12 plus numbers don't aren't sufficient to give the story. The real story is when you break down the demographics. They got nothing 18 to 34. They got very little 25 to 54 and even 35 to 64. They've gone way down. Their audiences getting older by the minute. Okay. So when they start giving out that fiber one, you know that they know their audience. Sorry. Did you say Alice had a two two? A two two. He's going to be. He's going to be wearing it this afternoon. Hi everybody. This is Safety Office of Mike Tyson. Heavyweight champion. The world. You baddest dude around. The baddest driver around too. With your driving tip of the day. A few months ago. I was in a caveman with my ex wife loving given. I can't believe it. Maybe you read about it in the papers. Anyway, she buys you one of these cute little golf. He'll be cats with suction cup feet. We take stuck on the window. My car when we left the store. The way home I drove into a tree. I can't believe it. Maybe you read about it in the papers. I couldn't see the tree because a damn cat was in my way. Robin said I was stupid. The stick Garfield on the windshield. I mean, that's really bitchy to me. I mean, call the heavyweight champion. The world's stupid. Now that's stupid. So I think I saved Robin. I left it. I took her out with a clean right hand. Not the right down completely. First. A standing at count. I can't believe it. Maybe you read about that in the papers. Anyway, my attitude toward Garfield and cat has really been affected greatly. I mean, in fact, if I see you driving around with Garfield and cat in your car, I may lose complete control. I don't know what will happen. Maybe you'll read about that in the papers too. All right. I just try to relax. Would it please 1302 a WOD? All these rumors flying back and forth. Right. Real rumor today. These are a sexer. I get another sex show. That's what we love. Don't get much, but we love it. Therapist or prostitute sexer gets. And I hate to say this because I like Marilyn Volker. She's a very, very nice lady. But I just, I've watched it on TV. You know, on the really intellectual shows like Haralda. And I got a, I don't buy it, you know. You don't buy what? Well, they're not selling it to me, but the whole thing there. But it's like prostitution. It is? Yes. I don't know. It is. I haven't decided. Get out of here. Will you? I haven't decided. Do we have any calls about Amsterdam by the way? Are the people that are really as ugly as I think they are? We didn't have one thing in call about that. Did we? Oh, man. You know, we can have a 97 share of that. And I talk about anything that we talk about. Anyway, by the way, amazingly enough, they're getting incredible response on a stand-up contest to sports channel Florida, even with that long-confoluted address. And stocks, the daylight's out of me. If you'd like to fly the movie, fly the remake, fly to the sequel. You'll love the album, fly and the family's stone. Let's take it home. Let's take it home. I want to take it. But I'm not here. It's not here. But if not, I'm not here. Can I help you? The album. Why? And the family's stone. Let's do the new path. Get it today. Let's do the new path. Take it home. Come on. Get a buzz on. Get a buzz on. Oh, yeah. Well, we're not writing the middle again. A real intensive thing here. And that stuff runs out. I think I got to make those bits a little bit longer. I did do that. Yeah. Yeah, it took care of it again. Well, I'm 37 and WOD. It's a little ratings party here. Everybody's just celebrating AMFMPM. And they're even having a big deal. I'm up to the front of the house about time. Well, I'm up to the front of the house. Yeah. Modern A-Lague. Hello. Congratulations, Neil. Thank you so much, sir. I got a Morton Downey Junior's fire report. Just came over the news. Yeah. Can I get a drum roll? Wait a minute. Oh, boy. Another asking for drum rolls. What a maniac. Well, just a second here. We might be able to do it. I wouldn't bet. Yeah. Today, in a Los Angeles County Airport, Morton Downey Junior went to the men's room, and thrown down by three young pumps. His hair was cut, and they painted a swath of the gun at his feet. Just another routine day for Morton. Yeah. This is everybody in the business is listening today. Can I do a 95 audition? Okay. Here we go, ladies. First one. I, 95. Not bad. Not bad. We'll give your name a number to Rose, okay? Thank you very much. See, although that only goes for Rose's. Wow. Or Rose.
