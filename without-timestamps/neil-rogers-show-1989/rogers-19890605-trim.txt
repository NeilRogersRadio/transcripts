Welcome back the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station Now here's Neil Rogers on news talk radio 6 and W. I O.D. I'm a cup then And a button man, and I trust you, Arthur. Okay, we'll get this over with real quick So you don't have to get upset because I know you're under a lot of pressure this morning 6 and the cups had five home runs in the month of May as a team five in a whole month of May Yesterday they hit six in one game I still I'm in shock. I'm reeling When you show in Dunston it's too home runs in again, then you know something's wrong Anyway, it comes 11 and three and we got that over with and there's still in first place and they start four against the meds today And that's the name of that tune. We got a lot of stuff to cover today Well, we have just tons of things to talk about really The cane show today the new split in the Catholic church radical priests attacked the Vatican Moderates say the radicals are tearing the church in two and those two priests will be father Patrick O. Shay and father Joseph Francis Collins Why is it a lot of priests have three names? I wonder if a father Collins is related to Dennis Collins at W. Snooze. You think that's possible because he don't have a prayer over there I know that anyway I had a great day at Calder Saturday I lost only a few dollars I had a great time got a lot of sun a got a little bit of a burn here In fact, I could check I burned it called her, but that would be And I had a wonderful time saw a lot of people and campland was there from QAM Wow and I didn't recognize him Mm-hmm. I felt embarrassed because I kind of was Sirlian rude and he probably takes it personally. I didn't recognize yet I'm sorry, but then when you walked away though, that's that Kaplan he works at Dick father Lee station He's an ozone provocateur. Oh Anyway, who a Hank was there of course and Hank had a bad losing dad all losers and Steve I understand I didn't run into Steve But he was up in a press box some bugging Hank for winners. No, he couldn't have had a really big day I heard to the grapevine he did have one winner, but Cuz Hank had all losers on Saturday Just he Hank stays with those same like sweet Bobby V. You know when you're gonna get over that Hank You just gotta give up some of those cronics and who else did I see there? Oh and of course Oh seriously, this was very nice at him to do Mike Lyons from Zeta and his lady friend were there And he had this package in his arms he slept it around the whole time luckily I saw him early so I could slip it around the rest of the day that I was there and it had six of my old CDs from Zeta with my name on him And he said I took this just in case he would write in deod here today and it was very nice And I appreciated it and he said that everything was just fine I have some big news from my clients today who I All the tables get to that in a minute before you start getting people to press now your room will do it and That's a confirmed room great meal at La Tavronetta took some friends of La Tavronetta It's always great, but this was the best meal of all time it was just indescribable beyond belief Okay, I don't want to admit that I had feel because of an off baby cow for a very long time But their baby cow is so good boy. It was just incredible and I discovered they got all these different new dishes named after me everything is Regereo Regereo which in Italian means Rogers according I think they make that up as they go along with the food was just phenomenal beyond belief and you remember carols Nees I think it is or was it her daughter? What who was graduating? Don't you remember last weekend? They were closed because girls you said Daughter yeah her is graduating was it her daughter very attractive young lady by the way She was there with the whole the Gonsa Mishpah the whole family was it was just great So we had a wonderful time in a terrific meal. I'm just kind of like recapping everything that happened Is that okay? Sure. I yeah because I covered the cubs game in like 40 hours or less I know this is gonna come up a lot more. I didn't mention that even Mitch Webster had an episode Oh, I brought in my life magazine to read while you guys I know what I wanted to say through I had a great time at colder They have refurbished that fourth floor up there when we go out there you're gonna flip that's what rich told me Oh man is that beautiful up there in the we're Martha and My friend's Mickey all those people are up there with a food on the deli thing and they've refurbished it and it's in large Did it's beautiful and inside where the windows are like the guy said it looks like a casino Looks like garden state in Jersey why it's all glittery and fixed up they've done a beautiful job out there They're really happy my only complaint it called her and it could be that the Braves game was fed NBC in a this area. I don't know because I thought I'd go out there and get to see the cubs game on TV Which luckily Saturday I didn't see because they lost in tenetnings, but The only game that was always the braves giant scheme on one monitor So either they had TV S on which would really frost my ass or NBC fed this area the Atlanta San Francisco game instead of the main game remember I asked you about that. I'm proud. Yeah, well You never know in this town and I don't so maybe somebody out there who knows which game was fed by NBC here I told you that Friday because this is but I had a very time out there and if I had a state home and had to watch him lose the next R&A I couldn't I would have been bad it would have been wrong so I'm glad that I went out there Okay, let's do a little break here and then when we come back we've got some shocking radio news coming up finally just astonishing news Finally we can confirm some of these rumors that have been floating around some of these ridiculous rumors out from other sources You mean like Dennis reason? Exactly. Yeah, Dennis you really ought to hang your head and shame. I mean you're a wonderful guy and you got big numbers over there and you're doing great But the rumor line you're just He just doesn't have it made he in fact I would put him and Steve Uh-huh, on a car okay, because you know that's your rumor seem to be basically the school of swishl thing It says that was an NBC feed so we don't play my friends in call to I knew they wouldn't be foolish enough to put the braves game on when a pirates in the Cardinal when they comes in the Cardinals were playing. Oh, that was a Freudian slip But um, so it's not their fault that was what NBC was feeding to this town I've had it been a hall. I could have still seen a cubs game on F2 Okay, I'm one of the satellites Are you following me? Anyway, it's proven it's past 10 at W. I would do we think whoever called him boy it's gonna be another Monday on that phone I can see that what do we get some response on that? Fasten your see my one call One call see pal three calls well excuse me. I take it all back ladies and gentlemen. You're really really Just overburdening us with response day.

I want to tell you about shells they start each day looking over the freshest Fish available in south Florida and they choose the very freshest Help This What are you doing in here denim for why are you touching around?

It was just phenomenal I just mentioned that for you because you're so nervous all the time and they just love me with a patch And they were just tinkling all over how to change my honor because a more wonderful guy time on like some people I don't want to mention a name it's a 1015 at W. I O. D. Anyway, we're worried we before these sales You notice the whole sales department is honored us with a couple of exceptions Coleman of course is probably lost today And our other friend whose name Mr. BM Captain he doesn't come in here. He won't come in here because I won't have anything to do with him ever again trust me I told boy Gary that this morning by the way you notice they're back Yeah, yeah, isn't that incredible oil days finally over huh boy. It took a long time The holiday is finally over for a long time this year Yeah, long long It's holiday weekend the history of the United States it's probably gonna go in the Guinness book of record two weekends And they finally have come back all these bureaucrats are back in the building which means we're probably gonna have some real grief Exactly everything ran very smoothly except of course for the psychosis from the sales department From I shouldn't say from the sales department basically from Captain BM Okay, it's 10 16 and here we go with the in- Shocking we got a rumor at the end of the show Friday was from Johnny Dolan and it said the Zeta Was gonna go pirate radio on the satellite now I have confirmed this over the weekend from another source and This is why they're just sitting there Sitting there doing nothing they're waiting this is not this format is going on westwood one satellite I had to know something was going yeah Scott Shannon is putting this together course from New York he's out of NLA they're gonna do it from the westwood one studio in LA and it's gonna be called pirate radio Which is already on of course in Los Angeles radio but it's gonna be on the stand what makes Scott Shannon a programmer Well he had like the number one station in New York city Remember No, I understand that but what makes him okay go ahead. He did he's got a very successful And he went out to LA New York, but I made your story in the industry when he went to Los Angeles I thought the major story was KFI What do you mean our sister stage? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah There's no overseas was to say the cats isn't at the job story that Jeff Edwards walked out because time like this was a douche bag I guess that was number two. Oh, but anyway, what they're gonna do when I think a two share out there Not bad There's one one one two the billboards that you see watch his face those will become one five pirate radio Billboards which are very nice The eye catching How does this mean they carry the pirate games to? Because they're pathetic so they're just really it will be a bit of a just- time when it goes on satellite three or four weeks And that's the story that's the hubbubble what they're gonna be doing it'll be satellite delivered Probably won't be any disjockeys locally maybe in drive. I don't know you know, but they're they won't talk to other Which is a kernel in the morning crew is gonna be gone probably I didn't hear that specifically But they won't talk much if they have any DJs because I heard in the building today from a very authoritative source That while Rose Folger was out of the building either on vacation or whatever last week that they were interviewing a whole bunch of people for his job Fascinating isn't that fascinating Yeah, because several of those people have been in contact with over here. Yeah. Yeah, I bet too Yeah So that's the that's shocker. Yeah, what a way to start the week and finally getting to the bottom of what's gonna go on It only took them two years of schlepping a raw along with the same Sorry music the same tragic numbers But I want you to notice that when we have room and fit in those numbers were just too bright for the rest of that format But I want you to remember when we have rumors from other people like Dennis Reese or Steve O They don't seem to happen. Yeah, the WOL D rumors that we've been rattled with since we've been here And you know I have not participated very did that at all Well, I can never gonna get let down the garden path when I give you a rumor and you know this I kind of like it's kind of like that horse that Steve was touting yeah Freakness it's very good example northern douchebag wonderful metaphorical Harrison yes, but when I give you the rumors and you know this from the past They seem to happen don't think yeah when I give them to you Confirm by the way we own a apology to Joe with twins We do yeah, well all that mysterious stuff that well Was being fed all total fantasy really and about that crank call that he received that day, you know Yeah, it did happen and I even know who made it It's 20 past 10 at WOL D father's day is coming up Father's day is coming up on what date this year is it? 23 after 10 at WOL D we just had an incredible experience a shocking We're just keeps popping up all over the place Tom Denberg opened the door again He said the way he's plus is coming on Wednesday Wednesday. I made him a steak now time has never been done to make him a steak But I guess he's calling Arnold's right now to see if we get the little real castle burgers today The ones with a bacon cheese. Oh, they made those special for us those were heaven Those were spectacular anyway You had a little thing happen with your battery Which we just might mention briefly because I came in in the hood of your car was up problems and it seems that that lifetime Maintenance for the old maintenance for battery I'll the water was out of all the cells and our crack engineer Mitch Wing was out there say my life saving your life made a little Make-shift funnel there to get the Or's of amazing isn't even called in Dick funnel from channel four by the way We neglected to mention last week Alan Do Spag over from Chaperis who used to be as a general manager for Admitted that the worst mistake he ever made was firing Jim Brossmer And then because I just got rid of that David Jackson the guy with the runaway s on the news that I've been ripping for a year Oliver Longies been here. That's right and then we say at the time Brossmer was actually Everybody liked him. He's been here forever and now he's up there in channel 25 a West Palm Beach Which is like being I don't know maybe he's doing real well I hope so because he's a good guy in a great talent and Alan your among head Okay, you're just a douchebag. Yeah, we know Larry King's on her Aldo.

Can you see? What it's going to look like at highly if they really go ahead and do that? horses Okay, and Even if they do have enough horses to fill a card He won't have 1500 people there Friday this really frightens me He won't have 1500 people here at highly it may not have a thousand So what kind of person would they be able to offer with the mutual handles like 150 thousand dollars That's like going to a bula downs or something. Okay, persons will be like six hundred nine hundred dollars The words suicide comes to my mouth the word flower horse comes to my okay King of dance Maybe back for a day for an encore. Why are they doing this? Oh because the three of them are just That was the cross crux of the whole article again is about how Kenny know and the dug down and Brunetti just refused to get along and it got all these personal conflicts with each other And as a result, they you know the whole thorough bread area in the state is like in a shade a state of shock and shambles because of it And they just don't want to get their act together, which is really a shame because we got some beautiful racetracks Yeah, and these people just won't get their crap together 27 after ten at W.

It sounded like it was off in the background It had no it was shallow. You know what I'm saying that be because there's no compression on this station Right, that's true. Is that true? Yeah, far as I know that's why the music stays like in a background Sounds like the level is even even if it's cranked up even if it's bangin and needle in there The music sounds like it's on a different level. It's Suppressed or something there's no compression well when if we can get any compression You think we can get some so we could sound like that That would be good then we could really do a jibble Five square hey 75 degrees and a magic Hey We've brought cast in life hold on a second.

There's carry whims I'd like to be pounding his breast And telling us all about how talk shows are gonna save the world from itself We're gonna go and make single they were gonna solve the problems in a medical I think a patient Oh god So much same this see that's what the public is tired of man. That's why they go for all these ridiculous shows because No matter how ridiculous it is At least it's different That's why it has to become more bizarre all the time because you kind of burn yourself out You know you can only have so many guys who turn out to be women You know what I'm saying and then it becomes old Like he never turned out that George Washington was a woman at this point Nobody would care they tell him what he had a pretty wig you know and What's a big deal? Of course the fact that he slept with Martha that might create some you know And then they probably be a whole thing on those shows about that Former presidents who slept with lesbian wives Anyways 1045 at WIO Day. It's true saying this man to me is just a killer It's just disgusting me too. It's on people to the same thing over him And then Yeah, and stand it Disgusting Well, I can't believe Disney was in the hallway this morning and walk by with kind of a Puzzled look on his face like GMI in the right place And even one of our engineers who usually look it does not speak to me Did he I said do I pass him in the hall was one of those one of those encounters where you just have to say something? Okay, I felt compelled and I said good morning There was a gutter will saw that came from his throat I can't now either he had indigestion hitting or he actually said something to me this might couldn't believe it See he still clean into that old Rick Edward Zion Z now he does he just hates me for that I don't know what it is, but he just has never really never gotten over the fact that I wasn't a Disciple of the Rick Edward school Mealing the mic based of the ceiling. He just he's got a thing about him. Oh, what it is He'd better get over that. Well, it's kind of fun to have some people in the building who don't speak Then of course I saw Rick weaver was in the sports booth there. You saw him from he's always for some reason when you pass him and he's in that room his back is always to you Is there a special reason for that and I noticed when he left that room He was backing out I've heard of backing out in the car But it's unusual to back out of a room But I guess that way you don't well listen he's been here long enough. He probably knows there's a good reason for it And Kat Stevens records But the biggest thing about it during Williams is keeping his mouth shut is he what that's unusual That is really unusual But don't give me wrong Jerry's a great talent on the air is a tremendous talent on here But over and above that his ego is bigger than the whole state of Massachusetts I think in a man is just a monster in his own mind But uh, Larry King is being well Did he brush his teeth this morning as he still got that killer breath? Yeah, they kind of look kind of purple the main yeah wait till he asks Charaldo to catch your check and toward the end of the show Yeah, that's when they're gonna start the fist fight You know, in fact the jury Williams has been on a couple of shows where they had fist fights too Really, so I have a feeling is that show still on? Yes, oh, yeah, wait till the last five minutes in Larry King's gonna whip out a checkbook and he's gonna write a checkout to Who's gonna look at it and then Larry's gonna breathe too close to him with a bad breathy aton Heral is gonna start getting dizzy and start to pass out and then somebody Williams will probably run over saying I know this and he's gonna bounce the check off the floor. It'll bounce like a rubber ball and then I'll start like a big bra Like in a cubs game yesterday with Mark Grace and Frank D'Pino Absolutely hey Dunston with two homer Yeah, Mitch Webster with two and two days Right now I hate that one and then he's right in the middle of this Incredibly important it is in gosh we had six on right yesterday however Well, we have a bowl of it's a pitch to complete game.

I'm gonna study the form and Spope it out myself and and so often you see that they really have their stuff together and that hit in the green sheet So if you go out to Carter today, there'll be no losers in a green sheet That's how there are no races today at a moral Yeah, but boy they haven't done just a I can't get over beautiful beautiful job on that fourth floor in the clubhouse I didn't I didn't get a chance to get around the rest of the track Let's check out any other changes but boy they have just made that Polatial up there great Phenomenal anyway the reason that they're blasted over a GTR they're air conditioning is out today.

We had a CD that slipped there and hit the Hit the button and so you heard a little mumbling there, but it kind of fits in Because of the big story continues to be club pepper. It sounded like we're taking up an office pool See which newscash did finally will be on which day the club peppers not the lead story on the news And I don't think it's disrespectful at all. I mean Steve was right the guy was one congressman out of 465 or 435 whatever the hell of it and He was 88 years old. It's not like it was some great shock and he'd been sick for weeks He had a great life. Yeah. He lived a long full life and They're riding in China and they're slaughtering him in the streets and the eye atola just dropped dead and God only knows what's gonna happen over there and Like I said the cup's it's six Oh, I'm not a lot of people We're talking we're hot gonna try and it would club pepper again. I mean let's give it a rest already Okay, let the guy rest in peace for crying out a lot if they don't sooner later They got to put that body in a ground. You know what I mean? Oh, man. It's got to be getting through a little rank is it by now? I don't think they've ever slept anybody's body around like this heavy Not Kennedy now he just he was in washington that was it I'm I'm trying to think even when TOTI field died I didn't slip around like this. It's 1114 WIO deal.

Yeah, this is this really just hits the spot without going nuts early Which is yeah because I had that big meal last night a lot of time for now. Oh, for those who are tuning in late We want to repeat the staggering rumor that we heard her because it's more than just a rumor Yes, it is and we apologize because usually up until we came to W mild we had an impeccable record almost a perfect record And passing along information about the business once we came here we started getting well Kind of manipulated if I can use that word a little bit into passing along information that was less than dependable. Yes, so don't depend on it That's it comes from that our slogan don't the Isn't it great that so far we've been on our behalf and even though Disney's into building Boy Gary and spike wise. I saw him they're all in the building and everything is still kind of mellow Boy, maybe they can go away again for a couple of weeks wouldn't that be good? Well, they must be so I was debating over the weekend I like to bitch about the fact that they never show their faces in here and they don't do anything But unbalanced, you know when they're gone things go pretty well. Are you in betcha? Anyway, the rumor is that's been confirmed by the way from different sources Also before you get the rumor I heard this morning from a very very very reliable source That several people were interviewed for Rose Folder's job while he was away last week And I said I can't believe that in this business. They would do thing like that We've seen it before we have Anyway, about three or four weeks CTA will be going pirate radio They're gonna pick up the Pittsburgh pirates game I think I'm gonna pick it up all this saddle. I'd from Scott Shannon's doing the format out in LA It'll be on westward one out of that way out of that building They're already doing it in LA, but they're it's gonna go on saddle. I think they're gonna pick it up here 34 weeks you'll see the billboards on which is what? Well, I guess this month. No, I mean what what does that mean pirate radio? Well, it's a new format in the industry they play They play some old as they're waiting to like go on vacation again. Maybe that's when they do all the way Thank you. Oh, yeah, and you'll come back. Yeah, remember with Stan you bet oh It was just a coincidence. There was not and I had nothing to do with it. There's not coincidence They play some oldies from the sixties, but different oldies than you used to hearing They play some new cutting edge hard rock music cutting edge. Yeah, what does that mean? Well It means like the records are sharp and if you don't watch yourself you'll slit your wrist Like Ozy Osbourne different New music. Oh, here's a question from Nick do they play Slayer maybe yeah, maybe dead milkman definitely the dead milk. Yeah, they play a lot of that And then they play some records that were hits about five years ago, but only like every second a third record will be a recognizable Big hit, you know, they play some obscure music Perfect for ZTA And That's it that's the story and the billboards will be changing the watch this baseball boards will be becoming pirate radio billboards I don't probably be the first and they're very very nice billboards Very eye catching That'll probably be the first indicator Yeah, well, they were they were having their meeting at the cheeky lodge where I broadcast my Friday night show from Yeah, and they stayed in there about five minutes after I went on here and then they all took off I don't know if it's because they know that I talked to every now and then or or what but not One of them wanted to get up and talk to me said that Jeff Clark He didn't nice guy and I couldn't tell much of the interview well since his operation You know very mellow and Every other Wednesday they bring him in and they talked to him and are still waiting for a response They talk to him real quiet and they hope that he'll finally start speaking he hasn't spoken in three years I saw Dennenberg. Yeah, he's the only one who was under five foot tall, right? Yeah, okay, I got to get the seat. Yeah, he lost two inches by the way and he's pretty upset about He's the one that they went out paris dealing with I think yeah, yeah, yeah, they used him They put him on a fish of these them his bait Had a wonderful time and the people at she could say they hope they never come back there again Good, well listen we were hoping the same thing that they'd stayed down there and I got a little life report on myself I stopped doing the morning show from 6 to 10 a.m The station management gave me a promotion they made me sales manager and program director wow Well, you're really moving up Jimmy well now I might have to consider myself a total asshole And I'm gonna commit to it.

Why don't we do it first, okay? That'll fix them. We can use their lineers. The original Pirate Radio, I 61. Will scoop him, will he? Why don't we all come in with patches over our eyes tomorrow like a sailors can? And we'll do our own Pirate Radio. We'll scoop him again. Yeah, let's have a bit of record a whole bunch of Pirate Radio stuff, okay? Why not? Why not? My amy, hello. There. Yeah. I just wanted to tell you that if you ever need lunch brought to you, I'd be more than happy to cook you some food and bring it over. Yeah, good luck to you, pal. Yeah, we really, we really taste test food that's brought in by listeners. We have management, try that food out first before we bring it back here. And we wait 45 minutes. Four a lot of day, hello. Hey, K-Fil. First of all, about the Pirate Radio thing, I know the folks at she must be upset that they didn't get it because I think they wanted to do that too. Did they really? Yeah. Wow, I won't make any difference. I'm not going to be careful about using it on the air because it's copyrighted and they have been going after people who use it seriously. Oh, we were just joking right now. I know. I mean, I don't care. It's negative for some day, but this is how you sound so. Well, Shannon has kind of a reputation of being a little bit, uh. Well, screw him, okay. I'm a little sick and tired of these douche-bagged, making it like Howard Stern. We played some of his stuff over on Zeta, and right away, they're going to sue the company and it didn't even broadcast things on a phone. And I'll screw all these people with all their crap, okay? I think I bad attitude. Exactly. There's a little Gary Lewis to play boys. Trivia, you may not know. Back when they were getting ready to put this time and ring together, the producers of the record were so convinced that, yeah, they were so convinced that the camera would not be angry. That, uh, he only thinks back up on this record. He doesn't think he'd feel... I'm sorry. Yeah. Doesn't seem more than a phone room. Oh, it does. Let me try it again. See, we expect a lot from you. You want another shot at it? I mean, I'll give you another shot at it. Interesting, Mediterranean about this song. I know it's not the same lead on this song. It only only allowed to think back up. Just diamond ring. Ooh, one, two, five. Oh, all right. Now, here's a man. Just like the Ricky Tickie song, but if you don't see the first time, back it up and see the first time. Back it up and start it over and go. I had to put a cap on first. Exactly. Another thing about the little Eva you may be interested in, uh, uh... Oh, Jesus, I have to dig that out slowly. I've been on hold that long. I guess it didn't make it a different way. I was. I told the guy we didn't care. He didn't care about it. As long as he's had, he's had his lunch. He don't give a damn. Next time, called before lunch. He's leaner and hungry or before. The cookies backed up little Eva on the locomotion, but they, she was not a member of the group. The girl Jean King, who was the late singer of the cookies, told Carol King to hire little Eva as her maid. Glee Jean King as her maid. She was a little Eva's maid. Yeah, Carol King's maid. Carol King was little Eva's maid. No, yeah, that's why I think she turned around. No, no, no. I thought, baby, sit her stuck in my head. Yeah, what was made? Maybe both. Yeah, maybe. Another, another interesting thing was that this Earl Jean lady was the first person to record this song. I'm into something good that her retirement's covered. As their first yet. I'm gonna talk to you. You are so full of that. That's amazing. As a horizontal. Warning, that chup bearing you played about a half hour go as Boca. That's not the real version. Does that surprise you? No, you ought to get the great 28. That's a good CD. Okay, whatever you say, Phil. And tell the audio chain to set up their per voice, not per music. It could use a little more bass and maybe a little more high treble. Some compression. Yeah, that too. That needs compression, this station. Okay. Exactly. We already got part of that. Have a great day, Phil. You do. Oh, what a way to put. Yeah, we already got half of that. We got an open line and a Broward. There it goes. Boy, this one too hour. It's like legendary. Okay. Incredible. It steams in here early. Opening up his mail. Getting ready for his two priests. Oh, where the hell is that record? I got to get that. I got to stand by now. Oh, Chase. You know, what a heaven of that wreck. We're going to have on the wall for the CDs. I got like four different cases here full of CDs. What ever happened to that? Are you not getting, am I getting carried away now? Yeah. You think that's unrealistic? I guess. Wouldn't it be right there on the wall? Wouldn't bother anybody. Just a nice thing. I wanted to give everybody a preview of what's going to be on Steve Show today. He's got these, um, yes. Or coming in. You know, as we see, this is to, Mm-hmm. It's from Spike. Oh, my God. It's Spike Davis. Wow. So anyway, the two priests were sitting in his bar. And then the Blair's head was spinning around. I was born and then. Nice letters. I swear to one of our good friends. Oh, by the way, I want you. I need to see you, okay? And about two minutes, I need to see. I got something to show you that you're just going to pass out on the floor. Oh, yeah. And I'm talking about 21 after the hour. And WIO. Right. 124 at WID. But the facts machine is just loaded with stuff. Yes, he knows. He knows. Just the police. Not for on the air. I got you. Uh, it says you, oh, here's one of those spy reports that are generally, um, pretty much on target. Mm-hmm. It says you may recall that the pirate radio story was broken by us. And a previous community case. So good luck to the BLD. Who? What's that? It's from the Zeta Phantom reported. I don't recognize the number of them breaking. We are compelled, however, to point out that the story may no longer be operative. Yes, it appears as though they may stay the course. After all, they've swallowed a bitter pill and turned the corner. This is shocking to say the least, but we will keep you a prize to further developments. By the rate, pirate radio is not as glendiscribed. We don't want to pick on him since he's somewhat sensitive. But the format is actually a combination of metal, AOR, and AOR, and high energy dance music. Very teen intensive. If you want to sample, call. It's got a number. Oh, who's on a bat line? It's always busy whenever we want to. Mickey's son. No, we're not talking to Mickey's son. I'm not going to, out of your mind. I'm not going to come on here. Is that the bat line? Yeah, he's called on the bat line. Every time you're like this, I'm not interested in any Mickey-dane stories. Okay. I don't want nothing to do with Mickey-dane or her son. Or anybody else who'd like to her. Or is she not them but the best? Okay, let's touch this up. Can you believe that? We get that call like 10 minutes ago. And right away, her son is on the line. I don't hear it. That's that ring. Oh, it's planned, but it's not. Is like the pot weighed down or something, Nick? Is the pot weighed down? I can just barely hear this call. It's on a bat line. This is a sample. Great. What does that mean? Did they say it's not the way I describe it? It says it's a combination of metal, AOR and high energy dance music. Okay. Well, that's just like a more descriptive. Well, that's what's like why, sir, either. He said they would play like a deaf leopard and then they might play Madonna right after. Yeah. Everybody sounds pretty delicious to me. I'll tell you that. Really strange. Okay. But you know the question is how many formats are left? Right? Good question. That's the question. And what this is a new format? 126 at Wild. Well, we just got so much stuff going on here. It's frightening. Let's take a call from Pompanow. Hello. Pompanow. Okay. Nice chatting with you. Fembert Pines. Hello. Hello, Neil. Take me a bit of a week to get my courage up to Corrigan after I chased the bird out of the room last week. Talking about the cubs, I'd like to start off today with some news and you might not be aware of, but Evelyn, don't call me Eve in Lendil, went down in five sets to Michael Chang. Well, I'm really happy for him. Okay. Maybe he can get some new teeth. Well, that was supposed to be something for the bird. I know. I know. I even or Ivan Lendol. I don't need advice. I just want to make the bird happy. But getting back to baseball, I don't just think it's ironic that Shao Wound, Dunston and Riny Sandberg, each had two run homers in the same day. Yeah. Pretty good stuff there. Now it's going to be, uh, was it three games series to see who the four in our four. Four. Four games series. Four were the match form over the Cardinals. Gonna be it. Why can't we play the fillies? That's what I like to know. We should play about ten with the fillies. How about that morials? Yeah, how about those pirates? They really suck too, don't they? Everybody all of Metz fans are going to say, Oh, we're really coming back. We want to four in a row. Yeah, three against the pirates. The pirates couldn't beat, uh, Vassar. All right. Neil, I just want to say, uh, Hello to Scotch book. I want to know when Alice's restaurant's opening up again. And, uh, say hello to good friend of mine. Johnny, start us to have to be out in Las Vegas, right? Okay. Well, we can't give personal messages on the air, but have a nice day. 28 past one at WID. We have an open line in Broward and one in Boka. And we got a couple of things here. A couple of somethings in the mail. There's one package. I don't like these packages, you know, because they're sealed like I'm going to have to put the mic down. One moment, please. It's all right. Someone, uh, facts me something here about Morton Downey. Junior syndicated show. I don't know what this is out in New York Times, maybe. Morton Downey, Junior. Gasping for air. It says MCA television with syndicates the Morton Downey. Junior show. It's about 70 stations across the country. It's having trouble for sweating those stations to renew the show for this fall. Now, this is from MCA and quantum medie ink. They produce the show. And it says some stations will not canceling the show. Have moved it to less desirable times. And this includes a course New York Channel 9, which is owned by MCA. And that's where they tape the show in Chicago's New Jersey. On June 12, Mr. Downey will switch times with our cynical halls. Increasingly popular talk show, which someone called about earlier. Why that show is so popular. It's from Rich Packter. All of this. Wow. Okay. And, um, Why? Frank. Oh, look at this. Look at this. Now, you talk about confusion. The name of this artist is Frank spelled PHR-ANC. The name of the album is I enjoy being a girl and look at the picture. Wow. What is it? Neil thought you would, uh, yeah. Wow. What is it? Ladies and gentlemen, Frank. The audience gapes. What the hell is it? That's what it says here. It says what the hell is it? Isn't that what I just said? The name is spelled with a PH and a hard sea. I'm Frank. The kids howl. And this tiny daughter of BOLIDUS. What's BOLIDUS? Is that it? Like an illness of the coloners? For seeds to demolish them. She simply reaches out, grabs the crowd and sticks it in the pocket of her Levi's. Frank. Now, you can end the intro on this album of the liner is by Orson Bean. Wow. Now, you can actually play. I enjoy being a girl. Oh, you can. There you go. Boy, that's actually the scene. What's just strangest looking to do? Oh, look. We have pictures of Frank. The HRA and C. Wow. Now, there he is. Drinking glass of milk. No, he. Oh, yes. She is not a genius. One of the songs is Martin. I'm a girl and by me that's only great. I am proud that my son know it is Kurt. The H was a hard thing. I'm proud of the circus. With my hit the song's with a least. Oh, just we got another chronic here on a bat. Hello. Hello. Oh, we got Norm Kent on this and he's listening to the radio. Can you believe this? Hi. Hello. Yeah. How are you doing? Get with it, Norm. How are you doing? Great. My name's not Norman. Hello? Yes. Yes. This is not Norman. Everyone's calling the Norman. My name's not Norman. Well, why does it say Norm Kent on this thing? You're not saying you're saying. Listen, is your name Norman? I said no, is not Norman. He said your name is Norman, isn't it? I said, look, if it makes you happy, yeah, my name is Norman. I didn't want to argue. I turned out to argue, you know? What is your name? My name's Ken, how are you doing? Okay, Norm. Listen, I asked a question. Yeah. Are you going to watch inside stories tonight? Why, what's on it? There's a new topic, new subject. Something never, ever before discussed anywhere. Did Lee Harvey Oswell act alone? Yeah. I've never heard of that subject before. That ought to be pretty exciting. Yeah. Well, I swear you might be interested. I heard to my night they're going to ask to John Wilkes booth really do it. Who's that? Oh, yeah, that's nice. Sure. Surely he's older brother. Yeah. Well, Neil, like, hey, don't go in. Who is this? George. Why is, I'm just a dedicated listener with the hotline? He's not on the hotline. He's not on the hotline. That's not on the hotline. Seven. Why is everybody attacking this poor guy? They're a cute guy. They're actually like using a flying rotary baseball. Yeah. I just call to give you something from my mind. You don't play Root's shirt. Let me ask you a question. Do you play Rotisserie baseball? I don't even know what that is. Good. Okay. I broke in my book. But if it feels good, I'll try. Okay. Have a great day. Okay. What? Poor guy. The poor guy. Is this Frank? Like I said, one of the cuts is called Martina. I'm a sample. By Frank. I'm a girl in my knee that's only great. I am proud that I'm a silhouette just girl in your knee. That I walk with a sweet and girl like it. With my hips all swivelies working. I don't get it. I'm still not sure what this is. This cat makes Billy Tipped in. Look like you're ever drawn to the middle guy. I don't know if this is Frank with a pH. It says, We asked the soul searching question. Who is Frank? And what the hell is it? She responds with a parody of French movie style. Frank is just Frank. She has an image set that some consider butch letters. Fam. Yeah. But Frank is neither butch nor film. No roll. She's about his feminine and sharpness. No rolls are defined by Frank. Yeah. That's for sure. And the audience gasped. What the hell is it? And that was exactly reaction. So I guess I don't feel a lot of touch with reality. Exactly what I said. What the hell is it? This is fath on her feet. She sports the latest in combat. Well, she ought to go to work up and braward county for the BSO. She should be a big hit up there. Wow. Not straight but Frank. Yeah. Spelled STRAT. Maybe just a little spelling problem could be the story. One thirty four. Let's see. I need to see. And you'll do don't go. I need to see. And you'll do don't go. I need to. One thirty six and WI. I've been I had this in the machine all day. I've never got around to play it. And I'm not going to waste any more time because it's been a long time since it's just got a change. Whether we have kids or beds or neither. It's what was that. It's un-cured. It's not cute. It's in the middle. It's Monday. We go through this every Monday. Don't we? Every Monday. Seems to me like I haven't played that in ages and it's in the middle. It's un-cured. Yes. Well I guess that must be an omen for us. Okay. Well we were a pirate radio for about ten minutes here and so we got that warning. So I guess we'll have to govern ourselves accordingly. For a lot of day. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Good.

Albany, a midcharges of antisemitism level against its controversial topial host, the local radio station, is fired Jim Bligh camp, despite his vigorous assertions that he was the victim of a scandalous slur. The radio host reportedly had vilified Jewish collars and repeatedly voiced anti-Israel convictions during a evening program, including an accusation that Israeli soldiers are committing genocide against Arabs. Very famous tacos, Jim Bligh camp in Albany, never heard of him. From W.G.Y. Well, first of all, W.G.Y. is not an Albany. W.G.Y. is in his connectivity, which is close, but not a massive big station. It's 50,000 watts. But there you go. A little bit of a hundred. Okay, 148 in W.Y.D. here's the part of the show that folks from Costa Coast tune into here through... I bet you hear it. Mike Lyons might be listening right now. Not nearly. Incredible. Shocking. And Phil Beckman. And John Cox. And Jeff Gunser. And Pete Boldier. And Dave Capri. Maybe even the Colonel.
