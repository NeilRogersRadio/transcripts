I thought oh yeah yeah yeah that's it. So what are you doing up there? I'm not really doing anything. I want to go to the next day so nothing happened. No just a lot of hills and a lot of snow and ice and cold right? No it hasn't been today in the first day there's little like powder on the ground. Yeah I was a little powder on the ground here too but it's not snow. I know. You know my amy. I know my cousin was helping I bring a little with me but that's a clock. Oh well what did you send? Never mind. Was it something I should have done? No just oh because I wasn't listening. I was reading the paper. I have to do a whole bunch of things all at once here you know. Why am I being able to hear you because you make so I thought I'd follow. Why you're going to be a little withdraw right? Yeah. I'm sure they got some exciting radio and all the names and in the Freud. There's something that's supposed to be funny called I don't know if it was kind of warning to do up here. Another morning zoo huh? Oh yeah. I'm sure you know what I'm going to do. I just permeating through your radio dial. Yeah they have electrical on this. It's like, it's a unique thing. Yeah well let's go get together and I went to a place called Comedy War and they had people from ACM there. Really? Yeah. Let's find out when that contract is up there. Okay well listen it's great here from you and you're our first caller of the day and we're going to put a little pin right where it belongs on a map. Oh thank you so I said I'm going to go on here. Hi dad. How do you know he's listening? Oh he listened every day he's on the road. Well we love your dad. He's a great American. Have a wonderful train of safe trip back. Okay thank you. And get out of that weather. Okay. Twenty past ten at WIOD the only local show in America that starts the show everyday with calls from around the world. Right? It is frightening. That's major. How you know this all three of the day lines are wide open. I see locally we're not all that great. You know but around the rest of the world we are giant a monster. Seven five one WIOD and day those are the only three lines that are open. Probably something going on they heard me say there was powder in the streets. Haha. Running and looking for it. Come back. See I guess that's one good thing that we have to work all those. Rue some holiday. We don't get this fall center security. We're used to it okay. We've been through it. It's sister. We haven't had any busmen's holiday. Of course some of the folks in this business been on holiday for a long time. A long time. I don't get a terminal that's just a quick evening. I got news for you boy. This is the most welcome call of the day. Really it's been a battle. That should give you some idea when I say that to you. Oh boy okay it's a quick evening. Let you know that I just got off the phone with I'm listening to you. You're the blessing to play. Oh. What? Ladies and gentlemen. I have to bring it in tomorrow. I don't have it here. I got it at home but that means freeway and spigot return from our oil exclusively on WIOD. Any got some other classics that he told me about that. I'll have to talk about it or whatever. Really? Yeah. But what happened to Don did he get a change of life or something? Yeah he was real nice. Really? Yeah real nice. Well he just got back to vacation. Oh yeah. You hit him in a real good time. You get hit him in another couple of weeks. Boy, it'd probably tone your face up. So listen. I understand you're going to have lots of studio time over there at that place we used to work. I heard there's nothing else going on over there. Um. Did you get that straight now? No not yet. No no. I don't think there's any problem John. I have no comment. Yeah. I don't think. In other words, unless you say the better. Yeah. Well I heard a little bit of their morning show this morning and I would agree. I think there might be a lot of being the less said the better. I'm telling you. It was great. Well of course you don't want to say anything. You don't want to alienate them now, right? I still have friends over there. I saw the way. Yeah. Sure. Not too many. A couple. How was your new year? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Ok. Have a wonderful day John. Thank you for the help. John. John he died. So we have it officially. Well I sure wish we had that to play today. Yeah. That would take care of that young jerk ball. It keeps calling with the Flintstones. Yeah. That young Johnny jerk ball. I can't take it himself straight. Not so to speak. He's got a serious problem. That kid. See as soon as I heard his voice. I knew. He's he's one of about a half a dozen. For the waterdale. Hello. Neil. I want you to know when I dial the phone. I was a young caller. Yeah. And now you're ancient. Well you'll fit right in with the surroundings. Second my teeth. Ok. Listen. I haven't seen you do already. No longer time. I haven't talked in two months. Really? Yeah. That's because I'm on a diet. Ok. I'll start with the restaurants. Ok. Well all these good friends are keeping fighting me out to dinner and all of this. You know what kind of stuff is that? That is correct. They should support you. Right. Let me ask the question. I was up that I looked into my Christmas tree. And it was no type of a word in Spanish from you. I figured for sure that's what I guess from Christmas for you. Good luck to you. What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You have a copy of a word. That is correct and I'm keeping it. But you could have. Well I'm not. You can you can put a tape on during MTV or VH1 or VHS or something like that. I'm telling you sooner or later it'll pop up. All right. And the video too. As of the last. Except the last couple days. The show's in really good. That's what I thought. No need. What do you mean except for the last couple of days? What the hell kind of a comment is that? The show is all right yesterday. I'm in the circumstances. It was fine. Well I'm the judge. I mean it was no trivial pursuit. You know it's kind of hard to top that. I mean really. I don't like on news for I don't blame him for a second. If I were in issues I'd have done the same thing. In fact as we should have done we should be doing that today. We got a month of trivial pursuit coming up. And we may or may not be given away prizes. Good. What is this? I listen have a wonderful year in all of that stuff. Thank you. When I'm through with my diet I'll see you over at the LG or Dino and just pick out. Good. I like I said have a wonderful day. 10. 55. Some people out there lived as if I carry a existence. That's a mykel from a woman. I'm not really sure who he is. You know what I mean? You're not. I mean I know who he is. But I'm not sure I know what he does. Yeah. There's an open line in Palm Beach 655 WIOD for anybody else that cares to call. You can call it line collective. You're in date, Howard Monroe. You're in Polk County man. Please. We live with a lot of what's going on to ABC liquor. Absolutely. Okay. Hello. Hey. Now we're talking. Now we're going to redraw the other day. It's not. It's past five year old. He's not. I got this for he's not even getting upset because this is such an improvement over most of the calls he's ready for this. Well he saw Phoebe K. He's on the so you know it made him pretty melancholy. She was on last night too. She's on every night. It's Phoebe K. It's Phoebe K. I like her. The birds house every night is Phoebe K tonight. I like her. Yeah, for she looks good for a boy. She looks like a boy with boobs basically is what she looks like. That's nice. She's on the right. Well, you know, I was going on the show a lot the other day. Like I was calling you. It's like the lake was frozen over. Yeah. And I went by down in Bots and I immediately thought of you. So I went in there and ate a few hamburgers. Now can I reach the off button from here? I have a grip right there. Like I said, he's starting to get really upset. Johnny, that's great. Now come on. Johnny did us a great pubic service. I got that cock to the department. But when we get to play freeway and spig it tomorrow, thanks to a done I miss his permission via Johnny dark. Believe me, you'll you'll thank us. I will. So funny bit. Yeah. All right. Well, I'm going to let you go. Okay. Thank you. Wow. Oh, God. I think this audience is all they're burned out. You heard about hosts becoming burned out. I think the audience is totally burned out. It took us what eight weeks, nine. Hab called collect from home stood and that we didn't accept it. Good work. He called collect. Boy, as he is he dreamin. He not only steals everybody's cars and radios. He steals a phone calls to a. Okay. We got what in Miami here. Hello. New. Yeah. How you doing? Good. What's up? Oh, no. What's happening? How you doing? What's doing? How's life treating you? Good. Okay. Just got to hang in? Yeah. Okay. I'm not going to have any comment about that. We'll have to do something about time. We're in trouble. Perry, I know him. Perry, you know him. I'd like to do a perimation. Perry, mutual. What do you want to do? Why do you want to do a car? Why don't you like it? Yeah. Because it's just it's okay to watch. It's a spectator sport. But as far as going to bed on it, it's not into it. But you were saying something about numbers. I mean, you can handle you. But I'm not know you can't. Well, I'll depend. You have some good pros. But the people at win at high lie are people who just play numbers. And usually the ones who play high numbers. Right. What happened? What happened? We're attracted. You know, you go down to pumping. And now you don't go to a golf. I mean, that's awesome. Coulder. Coulder closes Saturday. By the way, I go to Coulder. I was here the other day. But you don't. You haven't been right to the ponies over at a pump at all. A little bit of a pony. I've always liked harness racing better. So it's just one of those things. What is that thing? Your horses and the lead on the sun are suned. It dies out and you're weighing about. I mean, you lose out. You never happen. It never happens in Thurabra racing. Right. Horse that takes the lead always wins. Is that it? No, no, no. Especially a tropical here. You never know here. Which going on. Well, obviously sounds like you're in a stoop to players. You're out there and punch my brains out. I think you ought to call a tank. Give you some real good words on a pole games for next year. Okay? They'll fix you up. Just like you fixed the yesterday. All right. You know that, Hank. He's a sadist at heart. Once in a while he has a bad day. So he likes to fix everybody else. So they share it. You know, misery loves company. A blind and date where that per mutual genius just hung up at 751-9463. Boy, you taught seriously. You talk about a town that is burned out. Probably too much excitement over the holiday. Seriously. Too much excitement. Maybe we got a hold off and freeway and spig it for a couple of weeks to get on their better behind your sand. So real happy people we heard from this hour boy. Real well adjusted. Like this guy. Well, no, you can always tell the ones who lost a bet. You know, had a bad day at the track. Those are always the ones that I'm probably going to lose. Okay. When I go, when I leave the house, I know I'm probably going to go come home later. My wall is going to be a lot lighter than it was when I left. And that's okay. And if it's a miracle that happens and that doesn't turn out. Or if I even break even, I feel like I'm the big. Okay. Be that as a may. Henry Barrow is back with some more exciting WIOD news with some murders and rapes and drug deals and stuff like that. Yeah, the usual run of the most stuff. And welcome back at 1105. The Sun Sentinel TV book. And I thought it was, it was so bizarre that I thought he had to be making it up and it was an extraordinary fortest. Tom Jick is going to be on tomorrow. Okay. The first thing I'm going to tell Tom is they got a lot of work. A lot of work to do over there at the slum center. I'm going to clean up their act. They are so out of touch with reality. Yes. And one of the things that really bugs me about them is they are so Palm Beach County intensive. If they had any balls over there, man, they'd really, they'd start distributing that thing at least in North Bay. And they'd give the hair older one for their money, especially now that the news has gone. And they would start concentrating on Dayton Broward. There's nothing going on in Palm Beach. And in their radio listings, there always Palm Beach in Tenland. They've always got all these stations that you can barely hear even in Palm Beach, right? Now listen to this. Here are the radio highlights. I want you to listen carefully for today. And if you want to follow along, those of you who are unfortunate enough to have this paper today, page 6D. So you know, I'm not making it up on the TV page. Radio highlights. Adventures in Good Music, 1210 PM WXEL. Winner Estate in Financial Planning Institute, Financial News and Talk 630 PM WSBR AM 740.

Ladies and gentlemen, John died about 6-7 months ago. That's horrible. Horrible is in the word for it. It's one thing when they've got on Friday. What were we supposed to have the news had that thing in with the Creole Music Awards? We're supposed to play 610 AM. This is the most road pass. Inept. This would be like having the Alan Courtney Show on WIOD. That's right. 6-8. By the way, Alan will be on it. I mean, this is Garbage, okay? Really? Man has been dead for 6-7 months. They put this thing in here with a long, not just the name, but with a long blur. Oh, God. Jesus. Wait till Jick gets here tomorrow. I'm never going to let him hear the last of it. He's got to clean up that whole deal over there. Oh, my God. Is that in Cromga? I'm just saving that. I'm going to clip it out and save it. It is one of the most embarrassing things. I know there are a little bit behind over there at the Sun Sentinel, but this is carrying a little bit far. Don't you think? And don't forget, Fral, and I'll be on tonight. Live on WIOD at 930, just before the Alan Courtney program. And Alan's topic tonight, what does it mean to be an American? Oh, God. Okay, let's just start this out. Properly enough in Davy, hello. Davy? Yes. Yeah, I got a good story. You see it from one of our sunrise, gullies, living in Davy. They have a discount pharmacy place up on a university drive. You know, not to mention names, so you must know what I'm talking about. And I go in there and purchase from saving items and other items that I need. And among which was because of the holidays, I bought a package of wax that's really boxed with... Yeah, for the holidays. That's why I like the holidays. Yeah. Keep me on a go-to-to holiday, see ya. So in flight, a little park. A little park. A little park. A little park. They got two. And poor man, look out, those homintoshin' will bind you up like crazy. We'll see how it's true. Yeah, I know. Especially the crew-mockers, they're the crew-mockers. They want the other way around. If I had to, I wouldn't have to go up the front right. Yeah. But in any rate, they sell these robotic stuff here with similar boxes. But inside, the boxes can be open. Nevertheless, I purchased these high-apply items. Of course. High-apply items. High-apply spread. And you think that that sugarman or a treat won't take from them. But they actually do. When I got home, I opened up the box. So, actually went through the trouble of taking the cheaper item. Putting it in the more expensive box. Closing it back, go to the cashier. Put the cashier in check on the inside. Just see the app right in it. You know, the label. And here, there's I'm wind up with the tube of products. And these people absolutely, they're ridiculous. I mean, they're purchasing. They get away with that continuously. The stores and the people should be warned that if they go to... Yeah, so make sure you check out your relax-likes box. Okay. Because it could be a Hershey bar or something in there, all right? What a call. That these people should be warned. Yeah, around holidays, I generally run over to... After a gen-eye load-up man on my call. That's stuff. I get some extra kale, pectate. It's 11 past 11 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward, 524-9463. We ought to win five dead gentlemen at two in the WPBR. I would have to block this afternoon for that show. Oh, God. Now I'm beginning to understand why they put that stuff in here. Okay? Candle, hello. Hey, Neil, how are you? Terrific. Glenn? Yes. Started out terrific, and now I think Komotosis, the answer. I was at the Glenn's favorite eatery last night. Yes, and S.D. No, no. How's AJ doing doing? No, this was the famous high restaurant. Oh, I don't know. And I think... Now, later, when I let's clarify, we're not talking about Siam's dog, which is our sponsor and good friends. We're talking about Don and Kendall. Exactly. By my house. I his house. I work it. And I've got a feeling that maybe Glenn doesn't go there for necessarily the food. Oh, yes, you're... that's a factor, no question. But I think that the waitresses there are probably a little bit of peeling to Glenn. You know what I'm saying? Mm-hmm. Yes. Well, South Florida Magazine, Tyork at one, I think, two years in a row, best typhoon in South Florida in the poll in South Florida Magazine. And they put in there one time. You eat on hand-painted plates and all that. And it's said in there the waitresses look like contestants in the Miss Thailand contest. Now I believe you would agree with that, wouldn't you? She was a truck. Ah, cute, maybe. Well, I'm not a con sure of that. I saw a couple of boobs when I was in here. I was in there and I had the famous fish and squid. Ah-ha. How was it? Well, I wasn't sure what's, what taste it like. It was mixed up with everything else. I mean, I discerned the squid as being rather sweet. Would that be correct? I'm sure you had it. I think so. Sweet. Not with this kid. No, I'll pass. Although I don't need that regularly. Yeah, well, I don't either. Well, if you don't need it regularly, maybe you can follow that last drop. And you get the more expensive product in the cheaper box. Any, I just wanted to say that I was over there at Glenn's place. That's not Glenn's place. Yeah, I think they do a bit of business of a change in the glamour. Yeah. Glenn's tyork. Yeah. And you know, you're going to be in the track of the tropical park dervy. That's the operative question. No. No. That's Saturday, right? Exactly. Well, I might be. I shouldn't say no. It's possible. Closing day. Closing day, Saturday, and then Gosty Mopenzon Sunday. Exactly. Also, the famous Tom Jick was on CNN already. Really? Yeah, it's as a critic, you know, radio TV critic. And he was explaining the multiple changes down here in South Florida for the nation. So it's funny you should mention it because we have two topics. Primarily we're going to discuss with Tom tomorrow. The multiple changes in multiple orgasms. And we are talking about something. And a lot of these fantastic. And what other thing here? I was watching our new independent station, Channel 7. Yeah. And I was watching something on the inside story, apparently, it's a, I don't know if it's a new show or what. But I think tonight they're probing. This is not a joke. They said like a new concern in South Florida, but it's not yet illegal here. Midget throw away. Oh, yeah. Really? Yes. And they actually show like a little midget. And they like, grab the little buckles. They throw the buckles. I like the segment with the very villages. I like that one. They throw them off the boat. That's my favorite. I swear. I thought they'd keep this up. I thought it was like a joke, but they actually showed some of that. It showed like some people are very concerned about these people. Oh, yeah. Door tossing. Or right to put it. They said, well, he's hard to show there. Yes. Well, apparently it's true. And then through Bob Mayer right off the show. I swear. Mike's been dealt with not a ton last weekend. Oh, gentlemen. Have a wonderful day. Okay. So, big boobs at Ty orchard. And that's what the thing is there. I knew there had to be something. No, no, no, no. Yeah. These are oriental women. What are you saying? Oriental women don't have big boobs. Maybe you ought to take a poll on that. Do Oriental women have big boobs? They do. I think they're. In fact, Oriental generally tend to have small everything. You know what I'm saying? I don't want to get too graphic, but they really do. I don't know what that's all about. That's what I'm trying to say. Small. Yeah. Not everything. It's nice. Yeah. But small. Mm-hmm. I don't think Oriental women have their breast. You don't have anything to do. Like the Japanese. You don't think anything to do with the bombs that we drop. I don't like a genetic thing. I don't think they have the, you know, the breast enlargement is implants and stuff. You don't see that on other words. That's for real. Mm-hmm. I think so. So, when you go to try to orchard and you sink your teeth into that Oriental stuff, you know, it's the real thing. I was a rabbit with us. Yeah. 1115 at WIOD is the worm starts to turn here today. I just get a feeling that we're finally on the road to success. Miami. Hello. What does he have? Hey, I'm Ego. Come on. Yeah. I've been here. And the same to you. How you doing, bird? Great. I agree with you. Those four-wheeled delays are fantastic. Aren't they? Nice. Wayne from. Exactly. This man and the police pack. Someone who knows. Yeah. They're emotional people. I mean, boy, they just go nuts, yeah. Well, you know, I don't want to say that from personal experience, but they just go crazy. There is a fine point to everything here. Yeah. Listen. I am planning my vacation and I'd like to see what you take a look. I'm going to Huddle-Lulu. Well, Hawaii. Maui. And what do you keep? Mm-hmm. From there, I am going to go to Sydney, Australia. Wow. You're going to need a vacation after this trip. You know that. Do you know how far it is to Australia? It's beautiful. Is it? Got a big one. Just got a big one. Just. From there, I am going to Singapore. Yeah, I'm having this a year long trip. It's about 45 days. Yeah, 45 days. That's my kind of a trip. I'm really going to enjoy it. I'm starting tomorrow's a matter of, right after we play freeway and spig it. I'm going to have a 45 days. You got it. I'm supposed to leave on the 24th of February and that would have no film coming back. Well, how do you get 45 days off? Are you self-employed? Yeah, I'm. Well, that's a way to do it. There's working for other people, man. Really sucks. I'm going to matter if I have my old travel agency. So I can do this. Oh, yes. So you're probably going to dirt cheap. That's a very dirt cheap. So you're going to be over there with those orientals. Is that what you're trying to tell us? That's probably what inspired us. I'm going to enjoy every minute of it. Yeah. Every minute of it. Listen, something happened to me yesterday. I'm driving down this game Boulevard. Oh, yeah. A lot of these go away. Oh, my god. And repaside me there. It's a big old car. Got it. Oh, I'm going to go ahead and decide to go to the left hand late. Drive a 10 miles an hour. I look at these places, like, guess from where? Not Canada. On, Ontario. Oh, yeah. I got news for you. The Ontario plates are just as deadly as the Quebec ones. I don't know what it is. Oh, my god. It was deadly. I have a lot of people from Ontario up there watching hockey games. The Dead ones, too, down here this year. I almost had to stop the car and absolutely. I mean, it was just the apple. Oh, so to speak, yeah. We'll be perfect for them. I mean, absolutely beautiful. That's a matter of fact, I haven't heard it in a while. Yeah, it's coming up right after the break. Just a second. Because it's nice and long. It's about three and a half minutes. That's a fantastic. All right, Neil. Well, listen, what do you call us before you go on a trip? Oh, I'm certain. That's kind of February. I'll certainly will. Just keep us in mind. Okay, even call us from some of those points along the way. Call us collecting. We'll stick a bunch of pins. You got it. On the map, too. This is the real bagus puppet. Holds. Oh, I redeemed myself after that little little fog yesterday with the new rules. Well, I got shook up. Hear his voice and you get hysterical, right? It's 1127 at WI. We're just reminiscing about some of the old eating pinches with fat rich over at Zeta. Boy, those were the real days. Okay. When I lose all of this weight, and I know Linda don't get hysterical. I'm not going to go crazy and gain weight. But just once in a while, for all time saying, like Tessio says in the Godfather, can he help me out time for all time say? Can't do it, Sally, and they take him in the car and they kill him. Anyway, let's go to Fort Lauderdale. How are you doing Neil? Great. Hey, Bird. Her year-man is about Pasco County. Yeah, one of our favorites. You're the median, or the median age is 106. How have you been there? Yeah. I'm going to see Bird, Abia. Sure. They said he's up for hills. Oh, yeah, I grew up in that neck of the woods. See, Neil Collins, I went there. Did you? You're right. You missed the whole town. We've all been through there. Yeah. Real fast. Yeah, it's the whole town's about a block on. Hmm. Anyway. You ever been to Bartow? Oh, yeah. I like those little strip shopping centers. You've got every fast food place that's been embedded in Bartow. I think they've got steak and shake over there. And crystal. Uh-huh. Well, anyway, I don't know if I was down and how I'm down. I had double parks to make it the best piece. Holy cow. Yeah. Okay. I had a little adjustment of that. Yeah. Holy cow must be a conneutral. I run downstairs and he can run for the van as well. Guy driving. I say, what are you doing? He's like, oh, you blocked me and he comes out. He's about five foot two. He's a French kid and he's moving my van because I blocked the man. Could have been moving. He was moving it. Yeah. He decided to move it himself. How would have moved him? Yeah. I wouldn't have treated him. I'd have just cured his car to keep him. Yeah. Well, he was pretty intense because you know, you've got someone stealing your van or what? No, no. Well, you know he had something critical to do. Like he was an agagmatic hurry, you know. Mm-hmm. I should have known anyway. Just remember one great thing, okay? Before you know it, it'll be April and they'll all be gone, okay? Yes. We can just survive a couple of months. It'll all be gone. Yeah. Well, you want to call her. Bill my boss is out kick, flowers for the shot. Yeah. He'll do spack by the way. He'll tell me about it. Trust me. Yeah. Pop-knock. Okay. I don't want to know how to scratch Canadians now unless you're in the vehicle, okay? I'm trying to get him off the road. Okay. Especially in Halendale. Yeah. All right. The worst buy. 29 past 11 in WI-O-D. We have an open line in Brower. If you, hey, look at that. It's ringing. But just as it started ringing, the bulk of line went out. I like this today. This is kind of fun. It's like jigsaw puzzles are all over the place. Both of those Palm Beach lines are open. We just mentioned that in passing case there are any sickos. You want to call an incolus collect on Palm Beach in Boca. 278 WI-O-D. And the Palm Beach line, which has really been dormant today. Well, I told the Mitch yesterday is, let's get a campaign to get it out of there. It's costing us a lot of money. And they're just a bunch of old dead farts up there in Palm Beach. 655 WI-O-D. Now, you should have seen this line in the top of the Park Dining Room at Palm at Ole last night. Oh, it's free, right? No cover charge. And they get the, oh man. Of course, the food wasn't free. I hope they understood that. Well, what do I long? Let's go to a beautiful Willton Manor. Hello. Good morning, God. When is this? This is going to be a company for Friday show. It's true, man. Oh, yeah. How are you doing here? You're talking about sickos and boyd-outs about Kyle throwing the phone. Yeah. The clock room. You guys have a lot of boyd-outs? Have we had a lot of them? Yeah. Not really. Yeah. I mean, I had a lot of them at WS News. We just have a different board up every day practically. Well, you guys don't have working correctly in a long hour. No work two or three shows. Yeah. Ask Roger if they work incredibly long hour. He's putting in a marathon today. I can imagine as the phone calls he's receiving. I mean, the ones that get out of here, but let alone the ones that don't get on the air. Yeah. That's why he loves this show. Yeah. So he will be homeless and take his cat or anything. Now he brings the cat in here and kicks it around during the show. Okay. I don't think he must have some type of, well, the man who's the question. Oh, he does. He does the reniery show every morning. No. Okay. Well, it's right. Okay. Good day. Excellent. Good calls now. All of a sudden. Maverick getting some people don't have much to say. But at least they sound like they're under the age of 200. And they know they're placed. Okay. They don't think their genius isn't got a lot to say. We don't have a news break come up. I feel like like a fish out of water. I don't know. I'm not complaining or anything. But we're just going to zip right on through a little break there. But what happened? Boy, that's refreshing. Let's get that bokeh line lit up here. Come on. Let's get all eight lines in one. Today. I think there would be a first. Okay. For the day. Yeah. And pretty ponders today. Man, you folks out there. I hate to break the news to you. But sooner or later, all of that stuff was going to end. Okay. It all had to come to a screeching halt. And you had to go back and face the real world. I know you can't deal with it. I know you get a little bit of hysterical and hyper. But it's all over, folks. Put away all a wrapping paper and all the hot and good boys. And the Christmas tree and all that good stuff. It's all over. They're not happy. No, they're not happy Cambridge today. Because all our fun games are finished now. It's back to the real. Dredgering and a top at all often. Of course, we got at least no birds down here now. All of French Canadians and all these other good people are getting everybody's way. See, I don't believe in discouraging tourists. We like real living and breathing tourists to bring a lot of money and want to spend it. And want to keep out everybody's way and have a great time. That's fine. But we don't get too many of those. Basically what we get are just more pull here. So we're here to get everybody's way and to stand out of line. Clot to your job. And those are the second and the bulk of. Yeah. See, I mark my words that call will never materialize us now. There's nothing worse than you know, leading somebody. Oh, you shouldn't have leaving him hanging like that. Okay, I think what lead did you just chickened out. I need to. Didn't have the balls to really go through with it. Okay. 1133 at WIOD. Every line is lit like a hot-a-coboy. Let's take a picture of the phone because I don't think it's been a last call. We got a mobile and Palm Beach show. I'll go there. Yeah. Yeah. What's the first time in? What's the first place to cry today? The Jones sir. June 9. June 9. Yeah. I bet you didn't think I knew when the show was was. When you're as religious as I am sir, you know what all the holy days are. Okay. Do you want to talk directly to you? I'll assure you. This means it's going to be about Oriental women and boobs. Go ahead. Good. What's the first thing that we've got? Yeah. Oh, no. Well, you guys are so desperate. And I'd be embarrassed to humiliate. I mean, are people who are here here for you? No, who are? I'm not saying this guy is really desperate. I'm going to go all the way down to Campbell just to see some Oriental boobs. I'm going to see it there. It's a little bit easier to put his palms on the outside. That's all right. I told you. Oriental people men and women are not well-indoured. We didn't say that was there. And we said they're small. They're normal. They're normal, but they're very good looking women. Oh, yeah. Sir, sir like raisins. Okay. But they're being raisinets. We're a little bit more careful than the month was raised. You know that. Well, they're real cute. Wait, you're so so quiet. You know, they really are. They're beautiful. They're adorable. How do you like to take home and keep her a pet? A game be ready? I don't know. And it seemed to you, sir. I thought I'd have called. I sounded pretty happy. I'd be just a stubborn son. I think I might give this to the life a little home. Hello. Hello. I've got some additional information on those radio programs you read about earlier. Go ahead. And Neil, you make them seem worse than they are by not reading the entire story. I have the total entertainment program guide here. What that is, it's a series of special radio interviews called Dead On the Air. And it's people neared death and beyond conducting writing radio interviews of people who are nearly alive. Well, I'll tell you one thing, I wish we'd get some of those calling in to that. And you're all alive. You know, I think I did do a lot of credit for having the courage to stick my neck out this far. And reading this story. I'm far as you know, sir. I think maybe you ought to go back to your show. 3.7. It's a 3.7 out right now. 3.7. I was our share in the last trend. Yeah, I know. Apparently there's some connection between how far I stick my neck out. And an anonymous caller in your rating. Better get ready to stick it out a little further because a new book will be on next week. I think. You're paying off when the ratings go up. Oh, absolutely. They give me like, uh, in fact, they bring a bucket load of pennies in. They can't, they can't afford for my pay to go up. Sir, trust me. That's why that it closed the news down so they could pay us on. I made a mistake. I didn't know of North for the holidays. Big mistake. Why? But he here at me. The most exciting thing that happened down here. The football game was the radio and the TV station switched from what AC to DC. I got a new screen man. That was pretty heavy duty for these people here. They can't, they can't handle the pressure that that's why they're crumbling. Wow. It's been a lot of many weeks for them to get their lives back together again. The programs looked very similar to the programs they were using before they changed the numbers. So. By the way, speaking of TV. Yeah. We've been talking about the fact that the networks are now getting as racy as they can. And they're getting rid of a lot of their standards and practices people. Saturday night live. Saturday night. In fact, that was right at the time when it was around New Year's. Two firecrackers go off in the neighborhood. That was the biggest segment of my part of town. And they had a segment on there. Matthew Browderick and a whole bunch of guys standing behind a wooden wall naked or at least supposedly naked. And they kept saying penis over and over and over. They were singing a song and he was singing penis. I don't know. Did you see that? Yeah. And it's like the networks are now saying, hey, we got news for you. Whatever they're doing on cable. We're going to do it right here. Okay. Because we're desperate. And we need to bring the viewers back. And that's what the public wants. And I can remember when we were on Zeta, that was one of the words that if we said penis or vagina on the air, the general manager would go to the top of the flagpole and peel himself. That's how hysterically we would get it with. Get in symbolic gesture. Yeah. That's too weird. He's right. Exactly. You've been on ahead. If I can say that. Well, speaking of that, you know, I wonder why WMPN is running two hour movies. In other words, why don't they run uncut movies and pretend that there's an audience of adults down here? Well, they're not running uncut. Well, they all have two hours. We think we're the heavy Latin audience down here. They'd run uncut. Yeah. I don't know. I think you know what I mean. Although, yeah, all those movies couldn't be exactly two hour-less commercial. Yeah. I don't know. Okay. Well, let's give the censor something to work on. On our channel 29 is still, um, no, let's not do that, sir. But have a nice day. We have a lot on, uh, not today. 751, WIOD and date that's where that opening is. If you move real quickly, we started out slow. We're building tourney, crescendo of the walking dead. 18 till noon and let's go to Fort Lauderdale. Hello. What's up in there? Hey, a living voice in Fort Lauderdale. Oh, yeah. How you doing, bird? Great. Don't let Bob Pax here this calls. Oh, wait. You may be on the next bus out of town. Hey, anyway, I wanted to call and I'm telling these people that were coming on you Friday on Steve's shirt. They're, they're, they're head up their ass. I mean, they're crazy. Didn't just had no respect for you. What was it? I didn't hear that. These people just were saying how they were so intellectual and intellectual people wouldn't listen to you. Oh, yeah. Right. And the intellectual people, of course, all discussed heavy heavy issues. Okay. Well, anyways, I'm a, I know you love returning so much. And I'm from a turning game for the holidays. I thought I'd give you a buzz and want to tell you a little story real quick. You know Alan's resume, do you? No, are you lucky? Okay. Well, in my family at three real brothers, we're on the same crowd up there. What goes on in those fraternity houses? I'm a kind of little, what's going on in there? And I have three brothers and the female vagina. We're going to refer to it as bush because that's just very degrading women. Do you think, sir? Well, if you mean it that way, I mean if you're one of those types of people. I'm pushing. And bush is bush. Anyways, I have one brother. That's what I said during the election, but people wouldn't believe me. I told him bush was bush, but they wouldn't go wrong with it. Bush is the worst of the day. Anyways, there's one brother. He's addicted to bush, like someone would be addicted to crack. And he has to have it two, three times a day. It's not enough for other fraternity brothers to get it once. But he has to have it three times a day. And he shakes when he doesn't get it. And he's so sick sometimes more and more. He calls us at, he calls my other brother that. He's cloning my parents' bedroom when they're sleeping. 144, WIOD. And he's a little guy that he was out in trust. Oh yeah. Friend, very close. He's kids today. And the best part of it is his brother is 72. Okay, there's an open line in Broward where we just hung up. But I do mean hung up at five, there it goes. It's ringing already. Boy, this guy. Aren't they back? Didn't they go back to Gainesville yet? And all the college kids go back? Not quite. No? No, we got a sticker. No, regular school kids went back today. But college is always like a week-later. Oh, is it? Yeah. Just kind of like an extra bonus for us. Yeah, my amy. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yep. When you said talking about the Zoriano women, I definitely had to call. Did you? Yeah, this is probably related to the last call, yeah. The women doesn't know what he's talking about. They are definitely not willing to help. That's what I said. I know. I used to work over there. I was laying ties on the railroad. But that's what I said. Wait, wait. That's a nice, unreal road. Yeah. That's kind of a strange place to do it, isn't it? Yeah, it was kind of rough. Yeah. Anyway, what I was actually going to for a clock special would come along. Yeah, what I really call about was about the lot of. Remember when you were talking about last week at that one day at that woman on the show and about the lottery and all. Oh, you don't need Rebecca Paul? Oh, yeah. And then when you're saying about having a certain amount of winners winning and everything, it's funny how nobody picks any winners for like three weeks. And they want to get to the 27 million five people winner. Yeah, and especially with those weird numbers, boy. That was the weirdest bunch of numbers. It's ridiculous. Something very strange going on with Rebecca, you know? I think they have to pay less money. I want to have more winners at one time. I don't have to pay like if they have one big winner, they have to pay more money at one time. But when they have five winners, they don't have to pay. We should have checked out and seen how Rebecca's wardrobe is doing these days. Yeah, I bet to it. It's just a not me rumor, but rumor has it that she bought a meld and marco shoe will wardrobe. Yeah, maybe she's investing with Tammy and Jim Baker over there. She changed her shoes four times during the winery show that boy. Anyway, I'd like to say something to one of my friends, Mike, he's a douchebag. Was that Mike that just called a minute ago that we had a dump? No, it's my girlfriend's brother Mike. Oh yeah, he is. He's a real douchebag. And Tom to my disown business. Okay, I understand he's a little lawyer, Mr. Kides in the trunk. Yeah. Okay, I'm getting even with him. I just lock him in here. Okay, that'll solve his problem. Yeah, better go get him out. Okay, thank you a lot. 1147 and WIOD show his pick-and-up steam, nom, and every pervert in town is getting on a phone since he started talking about those Oriental boobs. I can't believe he said I didn't know what I was talking about. I didn't listen to your response. Obviously he made up his mind there. Yeah, that was it. I know I didn't want to talk about he says then he says exactly what I said. I mean anybody that's in the Femikates and Jamie Lee Curtis, what does that tell him? I should tell you everything he needs does that. We have an open line of day is what it tells me. Seven-fail. Yeah, Johnny, how you doing? And this Johnny, depth? No, it doesn't tell you that. Okay, you're starting to know your lives now. How about you do? Yeah. No, I think I know how in Dre's life. I would do that. I go to games often. Oh boy, yeah. You think? Yeah, well, isn't he like a tap up there or something? I don't know what he is. I slept, I think, as I were looking for. And he's okay, he's just going through change your life. Yeah. Well, this is the first time I called you. Really? Yeah. But a long time listener, right? Yeah. For least a week or two. Well, maybe three. Yeah. I thought it's about like all the blue airs down here. Mm-hmm. I've been working at Walden Books, like in Palm. Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay. And the way he comes in, it's a good, I'd like to buy a really nice gift for my, you know, like my nephew or something like that. And he goes, I'd like to buy a heartback book. But I don't want to spend a five dollars or anything. Ha ha ha ha ha. Oh. That's something for about $2.99. Yeah, no, I like that. Like a vano-white story, you know, the one with the blank pages in it? Yeah, I was like, I didn't know what the gesture was like on. Wait a minute, sir. Can I interrupt you for a moment? Yeah. We have a major crisis that is just developed. I have food that is just arrived from the Armadillo Cafe. Oh. And now I have to tell you, I have no resistance on this. I just, I, I may just touch a little bit of it. Okay, may not eat it. Just going to touch it. You know how that is, sir, don't you? Yeah. The certain things in life that you can touch, but you can't necessarily eat. Do you know what I mean? Yeah, you know what I mean? I mean, you just got to breathe in the fear. There you go, yeah. Yeah. What do you mean? Never. So when you guys go back, you're in like about a week. In a week. Yeah. Yeah. One great thing about going to college, you only go like, you know, few days at a time, and then you get like a 20 day break, and then you go another few days. And that's the way it ought to be. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I was looking at a list of national holidays. And I got a planner for Christmas and whatever. Yeah. And they have a national holiday, like every eight days or something. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I just wanted to come to that Camilla town stand. You had over a state. And I was going, well, I have another one. You're going to be there forever. And then. Oh, ex-Aida? Yeah. I don't say he's going to be there forever or an act. Unless you're some kind of sadist. Yeah. But you're going to have anything like that. You think again, maybe with WI or D. Probably. Yeah. Now that's all the holidays are out of the way. We're going to do a walk. We're taking a show on the road. Albany. You're going to have a show on the road. You're going to have a show on the road. Yeah. You're going to have a show on the road. Yeah. Yeah. Especially if we can keep Allen off the show. Well, listen, if you see Alan, tell him hi and tell him, call us again next year. Okay. Okay. Have a good one. Bye. Hello. Good people. Yeah. Yeah. I got a question for the bird. Yeah. You heard me there? Yes, sir. I've been listening for a long time, but you never really tried to go. How come you called the bird? Why exactly you called the bird? You look like a bird. It's 157 at WI today. I asked you how it does don't get on a three-year share. That's one of my new year's resolutions. Two upper lines are both in date, 7519463, especially when they come from people associated with other stations in the market. It's kind of embarrassing somebody by recognizing the voice. Mobile and Broward. Hello. Yeah. Happy New Year. Happy happy. Sir, it sounds like you're still celebrating. You shouldn't know for a minute. Let me ask you. How did you come to know this house? Go. Great. Thank you for wanting my with us. Are you still doing that on that solar? It's over, sir. That's it? Yeah. I can't let you check. You can write me a check for all you want. Really? Yeah. I wanted to do that. Okay. Go ahead. Let them have to be seven to WI today. We're down to a precious few now. And I know that Nune is coming in the news and lunchtime. And this has been our brutal day. Where it has. This audience has really let us down today. It's going like in fits and starts. Mostly fits. I say, say, next door. But we're doing okay. We're hanging in there. We got a couple of calls still on their four. It's not too exciting. Well, we'd be the highlights again from the Sun Sentinel from the radio page. Maybe you pick something else you like. Like adventures in good music is coming up at 1210 and WXCL-90.7 on your FM dial. Okay. Can't compete with that. We can't compete with that stuff. And probably Sandy's got the dentist on it. Yeah. Makes play a lot. She's got the pet dentist on it. Exactly. Did you use a shirt size-like? Oh, your voice changes when you go on the phone to when I put on hold. I know that's a little game that we play here to keep all the colors off balance. Well, I just wanted to tell you, you know, my first time a color but I've been listening to you for about 16 years. Which is kind of where to them. Twenty-one. My father turned me on to you. And ever since I was. I tell you what's even weirder than that. I've only been here 13 years. So that makes it even more extreme. Maybe it's the effect. Yeah. Yeah. It seems like a lifetime. 40-50 years. I just wanted to tell you when you were back at the other station, you were pulling, I find out what people did after you were ready for a ram. Well, not all the people are listening to you are 75-80 years old. They are awesome and they are younger. Yeah. That do appreciate you. A bit of more mature crowd there. They're akin to the 90s I guess you might cause. How old are you? Did you say 21? 21. That's what I thought you said. I just want to tell you that you appeal to all ages and that's something that's hard to find in this type of... Well, it's kind of like tummy boots. Well, sooner. If you insist. Yeah. But I think you're doing a great job. When you're right. Well, that's what they're saying for. Right. The birds pretty quiet, but... Yeah, he's been very quiet in here, you're right. I mean he hasn't been sorely because he's having a attack at that the past couple of weeks but... Yeah. Well, he's getting over that. He's recuperating now just like everybody else. And by tomorrow he'll be back to abnormal. And also... He was all-kate till the guy started talking about the Oriental boobs at the high restaurant. But since we're not... Seems to be a little distracted. Yeah. Well, I'm not surprised. And I'm not as puddle-bone over there. You have to really probe your memory back to final large breasted... Yeah. Oriental. I don't know if any. I've never seen one. I mean, I listen. That could be a real challenge for the rest of the show. There's anybody the audience who's ever known in a general sense, not necessarily in a family sense. Because every known a large breasted Oriental woman we're talking about. I mean, some of those sumo wrestlers are a large breasted but does it mostly guys, right? Do you mean phone numbers? Yeah, you leave your phone out. I'm going to be a little top at your door, about two in the morning. Okay? If you can handle it, sir. I'm not sure that you're prepared. Well, I'm not going to brag or anything. But you've been around. No man. Well, I'm tickled at that for you, guys. Okay, listen. You have a great day. You too. Bye. 1226 and WIOD. And we have an open-light and browner for all you large breasted Oriental women out there. At 524, 9463. So I think one of the colors threw me and I haven't recovered yet. It was that guy. And I mentioned the guy that called up and said, You don't know what you're talking about. There are no large breasted Oriental women. And like half hour before that, I had just said, I've never seen a large breasted Oriental. It's exactly what I said. I could believe I got told me. I didn't know what I was talking about. And then he said exactly what I had said. And it threw me. I don't think I fully recovered yet. How about Jimmy Curtis? She's not Oriental. Is she? You might have a little something in her. Now I'm saying, BBK's grandmother is Chinese. Does she? Oh, she might have a little Chinese in her. But that probably doesn't happen. It's 1227 at WIOD. And we've got Hollywood coming up. Hello. Hi there. Yeah. It sounds like it. Great. I think we're talking about these Chinese women. That's you thinking, I'll bet, huh? The camera dead on me. You know, I called you a couple of times before. I'm going on in this car. How about if you go to work next week? Now what's going on in car? What is going on in car? What happened? What happened? You just fell apart of the scene. Then he couldn't handle it. It was Yov and S. Wasn't it? Is that what he said? No, but I'm saying, I was very similar. John Rowe. Okay. There's that open line and brown again. This very same one. We had only moments ago five, two, four. WIOD. That's incredible part of it. Sounds like an airplane. Yeah. He's probably up there on a spruce goose. Miami. Hi, Neil. Yeah. Happy New Year to you and the bird. And the same news. Happy Shivouis. Look who a kind of me today. He checked on me twice. Nick isn't here today. That's why everybody in my prime. Nick isn't here. That's why everybody's getting the golden treatment. I don't know. You guys turn over a new year's resolution. Nick is a little under the weather. They got his punishing him for what he said about the cop and resist today. Oh, by the way, I know a large Royal Interprestant woman in high school. That effect, uh, name was Hangwell. Yeah, I know her brother. Okay, what do I want? I'm really calling you to tell your story about the old folks. Hello. Yeah, we're here soon. Don't get insecure now. We're at least the we're hanging on everywhere. I pulled in a left hand lane and left about the fifth car. And right in front of me, yeah, about 85 years old that is. Yeah. The late, uh, the L comes out. We cars will buy 10 cars could have gone by this lady never get to the intersection. The lights still green all the way. She stopped before the line. Here, you're waiting through a whole light for that next arrow. And I had a sense of experience yesterday in, um, water hill. I'm at the intersection of, um, 441 and Broward Boulevard. And I'm waiting to make a left turn on the Broward. And the light is green and there's a woman a young woman with her husband. And this is what really killed me with her husband and two little kids in the back. The woman is driving. She's behind the line. The lights are all green including, you know, the left turn is green. Yeah, just now to green. Yeah, she won't go. And there's the water to car. She won't even get out there. A little bit now. There are no cars coming. Okay. And I leaned on that horn. And she looked around in panic and a cold sweat. And I just leaned on it and Lee and she finally went. We look and needless to say as we both turn the corner and I zipped by her. I gave her every gesture that's ever been invented. And the thing that bug me the most is, you know, the husband is sitting right there. Okay. And he also had no clue. We had no idea that it was not an out of town. Played it was not a rental car. Just dumb, dumb. Why do we do the whole life? Yeah, that really caused a disaster. Because the lady wanted invitations. Please move. Yeah. You're the man guy. Yeah, because you wanted to drive. That makes you the bad guy. It's so safe to drive. I just wanted to win. He also had a bumper sticker on it that I love saved drivers. How about the bumper sticker? Am I driving safe? Yeah, call 1-800-8-10. Okay. Have a great day. Okay. That's good. And the last bus came in the tent. As long as those cars, they'll sign in the sky. I'm still gone. And I tell her. Yeah. Okay. It's 10. He said the devil. There's a certain devil is when it's causing the Molly's problems. I saw that. And there's jealous of all of their success and all the wonderful things that they've done. And the devil made him do it. That's why he was done squealing like a pig on all fours. That devil, man. He wore some mysterious wood. Okay. We got a mobile in West Palm. Hello. Hello. Hello. Could be a very short call. We can see. Oh, and the up front. I just been there. Okay. You can be nice to me. It doesn't deserve it. Go ahead. I went so rein man. Yeah. You don't sound too excited about it. Oh, thank God. We finally got a guy out there. He's got an IQ of over two and a good taste. That's right. Which is why he got his listening. Somebody called. They said something about teamwork. I had another statement. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's the best. Great line in the movie. He came out sucks. Hey, we all wanted to thank you for that. Thanks for my pay if I got it. Great. Why are we really doing it for you? Aren't we? What the hell kind of life would you have without us? I'll tell you when. Probably not much. I'd be able to have any complaints at all. No. I'll be better. I'll be better. But this is what we like. A happy card. You're our first one of the years. Okay. You have a good one. Bye bye. In fact, if I were he, I'd probably go in in the house locked the door and not go out again in the rest of the year because I've, I spoiler good thing. Yeah. No push. And whatever you do, don't go see any more movies because the next one might be garbage. You know? But it is a great movie. And if you're one of those very few now, you haven't even seen it yet, right? Yeah. But how can you not have seen it? Come on. I haven't seen Wayne Man yet. Okay. You want me to tell you why? I do have a reason. More listeners believe it or not. I mean, I had only planned about 40 feet. I understand that I will not go to a movie theater while the kids are out from school. I can't handle all the people. But now that school has gone back in, I feel very confident about going sneaking in in the afternoon to movies. I've never had a plan. I know where this is dollar feeder. You can go where all the old parks are? Yeah. And that's how they go. I'm not lying to the movie. That's what I can't handle. Why did you say that? I came out of the van. I didn't say all the different day. Yeah, so my plan, and I will tell you this, I plan to see it this week. Okay. And he's sneezing. He doesn't look good. He's a wreck. He is. He's looking for it on. He's even going to have one hell of a show. That's right. Seriously, that's what we're all at our best when we feel like crap and we just don't want to be here anymore really, necessarily. That's when we really do one hell of a show. And that's about time. Okay, it's one away. But you can't do those trivial pursuit shows forever, you know? How about those prizes? I love some of the people who like that all six of whatever was. And it get to the end of think like they just won the lottery or something. And Steve would say, well, they're may or may not be a prize. And I say, what? What? I don't get my chances. So what? Well, I tell you, we got more snores out there per square inch than anywhere in the world in this town. Plantation, hello. Yeah, I know. Yeah. Yeah, this is John Plantation. How's that possible coming on my street, Joe? You're working on it? No, no, I'd be tired. Okay. Listen, I just wanted to wish you an important happy new year. And the same to you, Joe. Thank you. And I'm telling you, you're terrific. That's for damn sure. When God made you, he threw away the money. He threw away the money. He threw them all the way. You know, a lot of people are very happy about that. You better believe. You better believe. I mean, there are people that get up every morning and wish they will like you. Okay, come in. Another good one, Joe. Okay. All right, listen, just a short call. You got a great show and get a best. Okay. Hey, take care. What a guy. Thank you, Joe. I know. We, we, we call. That was a major league tinkle. I was a herniotic tinkle. That's what I thought I was asking. Would you call that a good tinkle? Outstand, OK. Not just your honours. You might, my neighbors in plantation. They know how to tinkle. Some of them in my yard. They're always getting pretty ponders. North, might. Kind of ponders. So, OK, well, good luck to you. All right. Okay, that is out there experimenting like crazy. We have an open line in date, 751-9463. It's 117 at WIOD. We've got a mobile implantation. Hello. Hello. Hello. Okay. 117. And that opens up a line in Brown again. Okay. The mobile's today have really been good. Have a nice day. The last state. Usually you can assume that a mobile call, I would say 99 times out of 100 is going to be fairly useful, OK? Because if somebody has been to spend the 35 cents a minute, you know, you are there. Well, and get there at it probably most of the time in theory would be a rational call. And it wouldn't, you know, goof around for 35. But I guess it's worth it, you know. If you feel like you're going to be on more than three seconds like that, OK, it's 118. In fact, I think what we ought to do today, any more mobile phones, we'll just leave my hold the longest. I think we're going to keep putting them to the bottom of the list. Well, we're listening to that. What we ought to do, you know, like Howard, we probably be ripping off one of his ideas and Alice could get on our case on some of his station. But remember when he had dollars guys coming in, oh, you're looking for the biggest guy in New York or the smallest dollars guy in. No, both. And maybe we could have oriental women. We would close those blinds over there in a window. And we would have oriental women come in a studio. And you and Steve, of course, you both be emotional. I could be the third, the tab record, that would be unemotionally involved. I could be more objective, too. And we could judge the largest oriental breasts. I don't think we'll have any contestants. I just don't believe it. I've been wrong, been wrong before. It's just an idea, just something too. I think it's a great idea. Something to sink your teeth into a more thorough, OK, to develop. OK, let's go back to these exciting calls. It's 126 at WIOD sunrise. Hello. Hi, man. I think it's great. Good. OK. That mayor Hoffman is just giving a little emotional. You know, up a line in Broward, 524 WIOD, Papa, no, hello. To go on the old. OK. First time call her. If her remand is vegan. Yeah. Don't sound too excited, sir. Well, I came to story with terrific. But, and Dustin Hoffman's acting was... Mr. Rific. But... But... I think he or you, you talk about how this is like, top-proof, first-movie. Not to act anything from any movie, except maybe yellow, but more. Fraturation. And he has another movie. Well, I don't think that, first of all, I disagree with you. I mean, if you're going to compare this to all of our right moves, or some of these other, in the end, your film movies that he's been in, I can't agree with you. I think he has a lot of... Yeah, it's a lot of the echo. But if he's acting as him, who's Danny? But... But... But... But the movie transcends whether, you know, we debate what the Tom Cruise is a great actor, or a good actor, or a lousy actor. The point is that his acting, in my opinion, doesn't he track from the greatness of the movie, okay? No, no, the movie. In other words, he's not... He's not... To put it your way, he's not so pathetic that he just ate a lame, but he destroyed an old movie. He didn't even move. Yeah, he didn't even move. I mean, for a while. And I disagree with you. I think he does a good job. You see, Harry Potter, the way to edit it. Well, wait a minute. Look, the problem with certain of these kid actors, like for example, if Robbie Benson were in Edmouvie, there's stereotype. In other words, once you see them, you automatically assume that there are certain things. Right, that's what I'm saying. You know what I'm saying? Huh? That's the same with Tom. That's what I'm saying. Yeah, I mean, this actor is the same as Tom Gunn as the same as Tom Gunn as the same as Tom. Oh, you're not... But you're not going in there and watching it objectively, like it's another movie. I don't really have any strong feelings about Tom Cruise one way or the other. But I didn't look at it like this is just an half an a-miss-a-ton cruise. I just looked at it like he'd hear some movie. You know, and is it in the mudwine joy or not, and I enjoyed it tremendously. I thought it was just blew me away. Yeah, I was standing. At that time, the bad part I thought was when he realized that Tom was the Rain Man. Yeah. He had a great time. It surprised me to see that. And I realized Rain Man's Rain Man. Right, exactly. Also, the actor was the one who was the Rain Man. Yeah. He was the one who was the Rain Man. Yeah, he was the one who was the Rain Man. Right, exactly. And also, on WLD, we've got the poles of guests on there. Want me to have anything to hear? Oh, yeah. Ask where how come that wardrobe or her is getting so big? Yeah. You go on, you just business. Yeah. All right. Okay. Make sense if they had a bird. Oh, bird. I don't know. He says he doesn't know. Okay. Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why are you ready? Pretty good. Did you ever get my letter? And that's, and the picture I sent you. What happened to those pictures? Oh, yeah. I sent them to Don. He was on a phone. Yeah, whatever those pictures. He's done on the phone. How are you guys doing? Right. Just wanted to let you know. I don't know if he's listening. Finally, had my little baby girl. Congratulations, Eddie. Seven pounds, fourteen ounces, fairy. Yeah. So, they're in a short out there. I guess we both made it. Yeah. Sounds good. A little boy. You got a little girl. Maybe something. Just wait a few years. Yeah. Wait five or ten years. So, just call to say hello. Wish a happy new year. And give you the news. Right. And tell Gale if you see a walk around. I still say she should try dating a married man.
