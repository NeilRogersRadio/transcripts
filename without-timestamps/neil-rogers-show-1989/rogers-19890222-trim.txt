here and he's looking around in shock he just can't believe these political trappings are you right here i was a do you well vaguely like uh... history less and way back when i mean the building is always been great but this is uh... really magnificent what it changed i really modernized it for a while what it was there are people monitoring us so go for yourself accordingly right now anyway craig uh... i bet you there are a lot of people listening to show i've got any idea who you are please there are people my own family who was they didn't know why was you right great to see it but seven we get together once every one craig is fired once every seven years we get to go with the more often that is like a well made you're firing so anyway what happened over there i want to i want you to really well i want you to do anything you don't want to do but you've got a big smile on your face who i've usually like to rip somebody in the west well i have some day i may but not that's why from w and w s i please basically uh... from what i can i know at last october you know it last october everybody else knew it that they wanted to do something in regards to the all might program and it boils down to the bottom line i i don't have any animosity towards anybody there i may have a javasson pilot you know but not for dennis Collins no no dennis is a dear friend of mine well i don't you know when you work on night you don't get to know anybody very well and uh... i think it's good you know i think i know to those people and management you don't want to ever get near them that's true i want to get that but i mean dennis probably about ten times in the two and a half years i was there and nice guy to me i have no knock with him it's just that i know that there was pressure to bottom line that they did it with jep shells when they let him go not to replace him and tom shaper and uh... and me obviously i don't know after this anything to that package of Paul Harvey and uh... Sally Jesse thing i think they were looking and they wanted Paul Harvey but i think they were looking for a way to like i've been a big money cut the budget yeah well i'm sure they were cleaning people make more than you do gigantic bucks to do one to five in the morning but i uh... it was a shock i mean it's been a shock i because i knew it might in my got there were going to do it it's just that when you i read this business and i like being on the air i really do aside from getting paid i like being on here and i keep you moment and i'm sure that the people here would be delighted to have you coming if you do work for nothing well i had been doing that for many years i mean i know you would you made to i didn't seventy five dollars a hundred and twenty five and the twenty five let's not get carried away and i think rain still looking me with that smile oh we've got some money for you yeah and i remember that the ukula had to go to the bank and make a huge with draw just to cover those pictures remember today i told us and remember this story see craggin i can just do the next four hours we don't we don't care about the audience because we work together when i came to this market at wkt in seventy six and seventy seven and craggin used to do noon to three and i did three to six four big bucks i mean juggier i was making two hundred and twenty five a week and all the uh... crap that i could take from the sales department that was a joy station stopping so joy can that was a that was a last time i made what was the name what was the guy who had the tall thin guy who's to pop all the pills all the time the sales member the glasses oh passed away yeah any really yeah well when you pop that many pills you know it's been a little bit of a good but anyway uh... and of course bob alan was the sales manager who's been bounced around here and there he used to throw that little basket ball all day and a hoop you know and that was his but he's happy no today and took it all this year yeah well good luck to you bob but anyway we had his one salesman his name was mark something let's leave it at that mark and uh... he always used to come in we got this bad reputation to joy station the south beach station stop it he's doing you got these rabbis coming out of the and then he would bring in spots for like the famous remember we had nothing but joy spots anyway because k-a-t was basically the old yenta south beach station but anyway so crag was doing under three i did three to six and then said give us a break of a lifetime it came to us one day and he said yeah this is a great story said i want to put crag on tended to and neo-tudus six he expanded or shows no more money no money but it was like you know he'll do a lot see we'd have a guy nickel no we did live spots for free now we did want to get free meals now in that now and do you remember when we went to the with uh... early slown yeah or these names are coming back to me now and of course i'm the valley board up at that time was john harpur which i think is rather ironic i mentioned this yesterday that somebody who used to be your board up you know fire you that has got to be i mean johnson ice kid not too much upsterious by it by everybody so what the hell but that's got to be it me once a matter of fact no i did not oh yes you did you don't remember and wnws yeah

turf pub we could tell some great stories some of them of course not on the air but uh it was uh it was a fun two years i didn't make any money at all and the amazing part of it is now i'm making gigantic amounts of money i still don't have any money i have nothing i have don't have two nickels to rub together that i can remember when you uh we're trying to uh get a new car today i understand more than one of the way it's marvin you said three breaks okay we already did one or three more breaks for this marvin man i think this week he and Laura have been uh doing a little too much hanky panky and all right let's hold that thought whatever it was this marvin distracted me what three more breaks now he's got two breaks okay that sounds good to me how about one uh anyway i got so many

if uh you don't know who Craig were thing is let me just put it this way Craig is a what no seriously a walking role model for why you should never get into this business you hurt me many times tell

got free soda by we got lunch coming pizza lofts bringing lunch we'll bring him an every day in a feed him if that's what it takes we'll bring Stan's sonny fox all the unemployed radio people in here hey listen i'll be in touch with you i want to talk with you thank you good talk to have a nice day okay yep well that's embarrassing what a nice break in here and i go to punch it no it works uh it's great we have to wear headsets and i hate wearing well we originally did but we got Mitch ween here is the greatest engineer in the history of broadcasting and he put in the overhead thing like we used to have it wins that's terrific and so we don't have to wear that that's what i'm sorry going that's where headsets it yeah wld i in the first time i've won headsets and yes but you know as much as we used to you know you're talking about the okay we did have a great phone system yes layer goes real good especially when the abortops used to put the calls through it wasn't to go when they didn't put the calls through you do remember that one yeah great day when my i you you ever see the skit on Saturday night live with buck Henry or he's doing the talk show in no calls he can't yeah pump in the number of talking about let's kill puppy he's like boiled babies no calls and he finally gets a call to wrong number is nothing well i'm basically i'm sitting there doing my show and i go through that boring monologue and you know screaming and carrying on nothing is happening on the phone and i'm getting hysterical and so i figure well i'll really go nuts you know and i'm i don't remember what the topics were but nothing is happening on the phone well to make a long story short this has been going on for a while on nop i was starting to get suspicious so you remember saying that used to work in production oh sure sam became a spy of mine and he kind of soldered upstairs see the control room and the studio were way in two separate parts of the building so we couldn't see when calls were coming in they would come in the control room they bought up with screen them and then put them through he'd have to do a thing where he put them through one of the phone and then they would light up in the studio well to make a long story short every line we had five lines at that time four day and one brown at that every line was lit but he wasn't putting them through so i went nuts on the air and we had a little intercom little light that used to flash we'd pick up the phone to get a kid with the board up and he said to me is that better as if as if hey i'm eating my sandwich up here don't bother me got you right after you left they put in two way monitors so we could see them and they could see it really yeah and i was doing that same type of thing you're talking about and no phones and there was nobody on the monitor it was gone it was empty and you know you couldn't break for anything you couldn't break you couldn't do anything you had no control in that studio and for 40 minutes i'm talking and i can't get phones i can't take a break i can't do anything and i'm thinking what the hell's going on and nobody on that monitor a joy would have come in if you'd have gotten a bomb in the air and they cleared the building but left to you that happened to me one time too and they left me in there and everybody else was out in the parking lot don't show you what value a taco st is we got you what do you may enjoy the money or if news comes on i go outside i look around there's nobody there i go and i's looking open the door and there's everybody in the parking lot oh we had little bombs red oh i tell you they really are all hard that's a true story they're all hard over there anyway it's really criminal what happened to that radio station even though we didn't make a lot of money and even though the audience was pretty jury at trick we had a lot of fun was like hey i'm considering the marginal signal at that station had a dead well well well well we did pretty well not only that but what about the equipment it always autographed by my colleague yeah no promotion it was amazing the equipment was so ancient they had they had those old microphones that you see in those pictures with edison you know those in those documentaries you know those real ancient big microphones and size them on ever i got a couple of them for all times say and then of course i told was telling just the other day somebody the Howard Primer story about how hard was sitting this is one of the great stories in the history of broadcasting here's this guy who when i went there he was like a newsflunky he just was an unpaid newsflunky then he came Joe Fried's assistant who also by the way passed away Joe Fried was an interesting guy but anyway uh huh how's Gene T. Bloom doing that that's another great story do you remember the day that he beat up the board off he took him out of the street and beat up the board off cranking i got stories that just there will dazzle you so anyway Howard managed to eventually become something i don't news director whatever and when the hornstats on the radio station the senator from Las Vegas and his wife who just absolutely butcher it up that radio station they were gonna fire Howard and he's sitting out there and on that sofa outside her office and she's in there with a door closed with a new program director who just came from where washington or somewhere around director of the month of the yeah and the program director was there for a week or whatever and he was he what he quit while he was in there on bode steher so now he walks out she doesn't know whether this scream or eat a banana and Howard Primer sitting out there she's gonna fire him while she brings him in and makes him program director what she did one better than that uh this is the folks again now he owns a radio station yes this this this this guy was fired as a talk show host i can't think of his name and a week later he was hired back as program director i was the only one who never made a program director on this station no me too oh you never thought i was that oh yeah but i was gonna be program director but you know how the last minute change lin Russell and not see on CNN on headline news who's doing a good job by the way he looks right before he's doing a nice one shop but uh lin became program director for variety of reasons which we probably won't pursue on here anyway it was the first girl i ever used ruff language on the effort really had a big fight right in the lobby after she was named program director are you serious i remember a some interesting conversations out in the lobby oh yeah he would he Craig probably he he's better than Lee follower when it comes to doing a show with no microphone i mean he could do a show in my amy be heard enrichment virginia would no problem at all and the he also used to have this thing of slapping the table two and i remember one day he and i were having an argument about marty coin is he still around by the way or see uh not just they just celebrated his 90th first are you serious all four but we're having some kind of an argument and Craig was there and and things were bouncing off the tables in the uh in the hallway was incredible anyway we got to do a little thing here's Henry alive is Henry uh it's not Henry it's gale not so bright is ready with the update it's 1035 Craig Warding is here if you don't know who he is that's your tough luck for her he's desperate for a job he's another unemployed radio person and if you want to talk to Craig calling it time because he's here to hang out eat some lunch get whatever the hell he can out of this and we'll talk about it 1039 uh Craig was just telling me about Lee follower and how Lee copies everything that we do on the show but they're all getting all the time i don't think he's got this yet but he could i used to be working on it oh inside addition on channel 777-730 tomorrow night on channel 7 i'm gonna do a little sliced job on me so i will be looking forward to it really no i don't know supposedly it's gonna be a positive piece but it never winds up being positive you remember the great thing in traffic magazine they did on me oh i'm sure i know when i wrote the letter and you figured that i was out to godia but my only point was i said that i wrote them a personal letter that's right you wrote a letter i i always knew there was a reason i didn't like Craig yeah but uh he wrote me a letter saying what a great piecemark fisher did in a herald but i wrote i wrote to this guy a personal letter because everybody was talking about it in the town obviously and i said anytime you want to take kneels name out of it and leave the same column put me in i don't mind because i'm from the old school that good snow my name right and give me the PR that's all and that he took extra of sout and put the damn letter and in the thing oh no listen and long run it did help there's no question it was a lot of good free publicity i mean when you get to front page of traffic in a herald uh five full pages of and pictures there were least six people who's booking was she read it. Big bonus turning point my career no doubt anyway uh i don't know how much we want to talk about w o l d but the bottom line is you were doing overnight so i remember when Steve left there to come here i mentioned this the other day you did the afternoon if a nine weeks i was my thing was disappointment course i wanted that shift and you know i that was not your thing though and just that i'm i said that the other day and i said it at the time it just you were like a fish out of water if the format would have been different it could have been your thing but you're like you're a midday you know the three ten to two like nine to one at night overnight but there's no money there but i mean for example and i don't want to create a problem but if you were doing nine to one at night over there i don't want to mention any other names that would be perfect didn't you do nine to one here at one time i did nine to one at i and see the first year and a half against nine was when i came down it's then i did overnight's here after alan and uh... i worked every hour and still in the other room by the way i can well believe it i'm amazed all the all the uh... the hall of fame down the hall here is not still up yeah well i'm happy with that you know it will take you over to the allen court name of royal studio later you can pay homage you know it'll be great i love to get allen court the i couldn't come into the studio at night until alan came out of only at four and a half minutes between breaks you know the double doors here and i wasn't allowed to come in and of the eleven the studio wait a minute let me clarify something uh... share and may just a little uh... boobo here it's inside story now that's right inside story not inside a dish i should have caught that you know so we got all these shows outside story in the city of the upstairs during we're going to be on inside story tomorrow night on channel seven and seven o'clock not on inside edition which is on channel six although we do love channel six but uh... i do it too but we can't even get it on cable please but anyway but anyway i i only had about four minutes to come in i had ambition as a guest one night really lord and so we're standing outside there and alan bad and doesn't know who i am by the way she knows who you are that's a long story so he's leaving and on the way and i'm introducing allen court need this is an ambition and bishop this is allen court they and he says to end and got bad for a woman he was another world uh... he was a warm friendly i was a boy he was a beauty and orange when it came across on the air to why do you want to get off you know it was just uh... he made burks seem like mister warman he was in the middle of the he had horrendous demographics and i was in the hall back then you didn't and you're a drop of a that's true that is true there's been little revolution that's been going on and of course our friends at wld have a discovery that's another story anyway you filled in and they jerk you're around there in the night with the only guy in the world who can burn bridges and end up with that station whatever it is hey listen i ran by ripp this place so unmercifully when disney came here i know you did and and deserve at least so they admit it they say you know everything you said was true right because they put burcon they put all this crap on on a weekend which they haven't improved much by the way you might want to think about doing weekends for some serious money no i see this is a money with the best of neale the best of all yes did everybody yeah the story on the best of neale by the way they came to me in a Friday and uh... bill wise said to me who shows up only like alternate Friday he says a lot of golf he said to me well now might disney tells me he's spoken to you about this best of neale rass said what i said no it's not a my contract i don't know anything about that but so the next day it went on the air but what was i gonna say i mean i don't really care it's certainly a look at a six days which i did at i and z that was brutal that was gary Lawrence should forever be punished for making me do that six days of this is too much chase it i didn't pay you we didn't do six days i did i had to you did yeah but that was for but you got paid extra for what yes i did some real heavy heavy heavy $20 days now i really think in those days we had more money than we do now well in your case that's that could be true of almost anything well i did i i did the most i have made in this business neale the height my last year at i and z and my for i mean my last year kt my first year that overnight at i and z until health bank had me fired through david right of who i never met i made thirty nine thousand dollars that was the most ever made in the business since then it's been a downhill slide but uh... i wasn't bad at the time though that was i wasn't not good money to get a point and i managed to get by because i'm a little bit as you and lario is that you know yeah just i would not do with the money you're making i mean i really would not do with it but i remember i like the trial area i want to larry's favorite diets remember a place called marries in north Miami where we used to get pizza with them when you lived up there k very k's okay no can i'll marry nonaries or marries on seven seven seven yeah and larry camp was on these alternate diets like all arrest of us and he's he's to get these enormous extra large pizzas and he would eat the topping off the pizza and throw the crust of the topping only had forty seven thousand calories but uh... marries was good now that area has changed dramatically all god yes for the worst i mean all of those those are pretty interesting days i lived a twin lakes racked club by the golden glades and you lived on their bi um just down on the road at fifth year hundred thirty fifth remember when you're to sneak up to a pop a note a drink those some magnificent strawberry dikeyes at the uh... don't worry dikeyes yet well that's what they were called wasn't that you mean at the track no no no no we went to the track with you but no one potato two potato three potato oh yeah boy that's really good and have great yeah break dikeyes and why does he keep saying dikeyes that's what the word is Zachary no no i hate to see it's a bar for dikeyes that's a set of sea work it was it was so crazy dikeyes why sounds like a place where uh... Sally Jenny doing her shoulder that all are guests on that dikeyes that's a place that's so crowded you had to wait at the bar for your table for so long yeah i got that was there very good place it was great it's not very well right one out of business all the good places went out when you got some good places that other place you had a sponsor the uh... the uh... the health food place the unicorn they made a great drink well that's all we're very important is doing great oh i was over the other day allegedly in the terries been promising me this for a long time there's supposed to be opening one up in plantation or really which would do so well yeah because plantations got a dirt the restaurant but we don't have anything i don't understand this how did you come to live in boca well yeah so far from anywhere you had to be burdened up all your gas money just going to work every night i i had a very short television career on channel 39 and uh... so i was looking from midway point to so everybody in the family could get to their jobs somebody working in west parman i was working in hollywood and boca happened to be the middle point and i said i can't afford boca but i found a little uh... grobbling area you know where they have a squad as right and i get into what they call a townhouse or i call a duplex and uh... that's where i am as cheap it was cheap at the time to get a cheaper there to live than to live in day county abroad and it was middle then i got fired two weeks later a channel because i look at him these different stories keep coming back to mine because we really had a lot of fun during the special decayed t-days and we had a sponsor called the cock and bull restaurant oh she members yeah the one with a big cock on the roof and a little girl i thought that yeah i said about that i got a problem out yeah i felt anyway now that was the guy's name salt taster and what was his son who had the one in highly yeah i don't remember i mean they were really nice people and it was very good it wasn't a pretty good it was pretty good no i mean for what it was it wasn't a fancy gourmet restaurant but it was a working man's restaurant exactly we ate for free and i was letting you have this guy in fact now it just comes back to mine build the shara who was on witchenor all the time playing music and playing his guitar and chubby with caucho and i never forget he was telling us this story about how he was doing his Elvis imitation build the shara and how the whole crowd would look at him and say oh this it's Elvis i'm just struck me this guy started like Elvis about as much as remember the guy that's that in for renewing those clowns on that Friday and they were all doing voice and they were doing imitations and they were all using their own voice it would be like by saying okay here's line of turner hi everybody hi you doing and that that was how much he sounded like Elvis the other greatest story when you were probably the worst crying fit in the history of mankind you were doing a spot some live spot you were on and i was in the studio okay and they had these huge drapes okay these big red velvet plus drapes and there was a bird bath outside and you stand in the window and watch the bird bath that would be one of the most exciting things that would happen here and you were doing a spot one of these real geriatric things for some some geriatric equipment supply place and the line was something about what you said arched heels or something yeah i don't remember what i thought that was the word that started but you started laughing and i started laughing to the point where i was shaking and i was holding onto the drapes to keep from falling on the floor i was laughing so hard and he's sitting there trying to do a serious spot because this was a geriatric this was not a laughing bucket that was not full around spot and i said i look back in him and his face was so red and he was in one of those laughing fits to the poor i thought he was going to choke to death on the air was incredible right after you left you got to tell a quick story remember the big red carpet in that studio i had Glen Rinker and Ann Bishop on his guests and i had about four spots backed up to do live back on one of top of another and so and i shouldn't tell an ambition blade spreading a lot on the floor out of the air and when rinker got on top of her and was you know what is the truth and she leaned out from under which he said could you picture Ralph Renek doing this and i just broke home all over car are you serious that story that isn't a credible story to that end doesn't know who i am it's five past eleven a w i o d e. leaf all i says he would love to call but is prohibited by w j and o management and we know that jiff Charles is leaving for w p r o and Providence wrote on and we wish him well he uh don't buy a house yet that's all i can tell he changes jobs more often than some people change underwear doesn't he him and ed till at least he doesn't mind moving all over the country say i won't do that i don't want to i don't really know what to say because i know that this guy's leaving and there's a job opening up there so i don't want to create anything that would create a problem for you so anything that i say please keep in mind it's that nasty rotten meal let's say play but not break but i'll not deal you're more happy to take the blame but this management up there w j and o you saw jick is calling me other day where they don't want to either people go and i read that he shows with people from other states which is so petty and so trolley and now lee is prohibited to call by the management up there now i must say this and this is this is an honest statement leaf follower on the air is mediocre at best lee follower calling my show is sensational his greatest performances were calls to my show and i used to we used to kid him about it lee you ought to you ought to be a professional caller and get paid by the call it called different talk shows because on the phone he's funny he's great he's funny guy here he does all that over the authors and steal in my material and steal and steal and steal his guest in all of that crap but on the phone he's great so now they've taken away the one area of his career that he really had growing they was really going for calling these show and they've cut it out like tearing his guts out okay let's take some calls for Craig because i could go on here and it would just mean nothing to anybody including Craig sunrise hello hi hi Neil first of all i have to tell you that yours is the first place i heard in 78 i i really miss talk shows you be like when you woke up in the morning one day or no is an error effect and i mean enough i remember no it wasn't in the morning it was dry for us i 78 we were coming home from an outing and i switched to radio and i heard your voice and i listened forever wow must have a useful actor remember that day and everything well i don't know don't put my life down i knew you would do that because i know you so well just a little joke okay i'm talking i'll tell you why i remember it so well because i was a fan of Bob Grant when i came down here i went without uh talk radio for three years and i just happened to enjoy talk radio and uh as well it was just a little bit of information that yours was the first place at any rate Craig or one of my favorite people i think you're tremendously talented and i've had it to that other station and so i helped me god i stayed with them for 11 years and last night was the first time i refused to turn it on and i won't well i appreciate that man but let's face it we're all fickle including myself and we all get disappointed to be a radio station the television stations but uh you don't give up stations because you know oh yes i know so you maybe you do but you're a rare exception because generally what happens all of his loyal people that love you and it would just go crazy if you left the new voice comes on on monday after you've been canned on friday and the new voice comes on and does 20 minutes and goes the first call and the caller says oh you're a breath of fresh air that's the favorite line in this time no matter who it is it could be a giraffe okay making gutter will sounds and it all out of breath of fresh air yeah well i'm afraid i'm not like that and and let me explain why i feel as i do first of all i say you're one of my favorite people i enjoyed you in the afternoon when you took over those weeks and i enjoyed just early at one in the morning because that's my time my family is all taken care and that's my time that's one of the advantages really of overnight people a little more intimate and relaxed absolutely we're not all geriatric out there i i'm you know that's true and that's another myth that people have now again i you know i'm sure if you could break down and see it on paper it probably would show heavily but as far as call as i found younger call as on an all-light show then i did it many other hours down here yeah for an hour because i have been stereotyped as the old ladies favorite you know you show craze you don't craze you don't craze you don't craze when witch nirhand your when witch nirhand your spot it was older when you came on the scene it was lively it was fun well geries must a geries listeners died 20 years ago but nobody told him that's a problem they died about the time his wig passed out well listen have a great day i want to tell you one thing in closing yeah what in closing why i say i turned off to the station it's not simply because they fired craze or that you left or came left or leave out well i wait a minute what i'm a way and hold it i never worked for this out for thank god i never worked for gefferson i i got i got i got i got i got i got i got out two owners ago and i can assure you i never will work for gefferson i didn't see it because they don't want to pay anybody anything you happen to be right now because they really don't know what they're doing and they should sell but at any rate the reason i am never going to listen again is because they have made it very clean and clear that they don't give a damn about the listeners we didn't want craze we didn't want came to leave i personally wait a minute ma i've got it in a rupt here and i appreciate your loyalty but at the same time i don't believe management of local radio stations down here any of them really really give at damn about the listener they care about the bottom line and that's what the corporation cares about it they're there no different than this station or any other station well maybe so i mean i'm not thrilled with that either but i'm saying it's good though if they didn't have the fm if they didn't have life with those humongous numbers of people listening and elevators and dentist offices if they didn't have that they might as well shut the a m off at this point based on what i understand i that could be wrong but i don't think she's that is fine that i'm all because i listen to that once in a while yes well listen have a wonderful life well i wish you that too okay you never turn on a listen to like really never never i don't even know where it is on the dial okay i don't know everything about ready who you know i don't i have no idea where it is that i swear to you i wouldn't if you want to give me a million dollars and said tune the radio punch it up immediately i couldn't do it i have no way if i get a you came out of a music background see i but not alive that isn't no no i am not that no what i'm saying you came out of you were rock jock and those kind of things and i forget that so is right well keep it in mind okay we have an open on it but that morning show on life that's my favorite man especially when Bob Lasseter used to be the voice over is i'd be so depressed i want to blow my brains up okay we have an open line in Broward 524 WOD Craig Worthing is here if you want to get your car painted i remember you used to drive that checker cab yeah i just no matter what spot i got here there's something with Craig all these colorful stories that he just had drive this old checker cab a boy didn't need a paint job bad and if arco would have been around then you could have taken it over there anyway it's 11 16 that's true there's a trend coming out on um Friday unfortunately overnight's don't show in there oh nobody gives a damn bottle of a night's getting that was me yeah except for those who would like to have a job yeah anyway uh sharing was right you've been much too nice to WOLD and it's about but i know it's about some you think i'm a wimp and a whispers i really have no axe to grind with it one of the what an arco went on we used to have in the all that we can burn bridges you can you're able to do it that's why we all envy you and and and at my you for that i love it when you give how to manage but you know i've had my fair share but at that i'm doing his telling truth at most of them are morons most of them are subhuman douchebags who treat us like garbage like chattelie you know just like you like your cattle exactly and most of them don't have any talents you that's the thing i really say come out of sales most of them are just glorified sales people who can't do anything else in a business and then they become a management you know i'm never forget Stanley Cohen a winc i used to have some of the most frustrating conversations with Stanley jay Cohen who again was a sales manager who all of a sudden when health rank left he just inherited becoming general manager and and i would go in there and he would say nil thot talk to me about engineering i don't know anything about it don't talk to me about programming i don't know anything about programming don't talk and i would say to him Stanley what do you know about and he would sit there with his jaw doubt it was public he wouldn't have an answer because he didn't know anything it was an ice guy but he knew nothing about nothing and he was my boss yeah now the people here i will say this i mean i rip him a lot and i kiddo them but seriously the people here other than being brain defective they are they're tremendous they're really incredible i don't think they know anything but they're very nice people which is amazing they only other not we when i used to argue about Sid Levine because you had i love Sid wait a minute wait a minute you like him too i like him personally it pains me deeply i don't know why well not deeply like about this thing but it bugs me that this man has never ever made a phone call never dropped me a line i mean he was like he was my first general manager in this market i had about my show couple times when he was chilling for the governor member of a couple of those yeah posh political jobs that he saw famous for and i had him on a show couple of times but he never said the main fact he always would make comments to other people around like well you know we're trying to wait a minute on this try to reform you know get him to be is in other words Sid would give the impression that he was depressed because i didn't go back to that old bilsmith monotone terminally boring talk that he used to love i mean i but he loved you on the i've got to tell you a quick story and i really shouldn't because i i'm no closer to the city new i accept i will you love said i would work for said i like to worry you love said look he's a nice as person of our work well i love never in the what do you like so no i don't know we and there's one thing where his brother says he says i like bread you love bread i like bread yeah you love said i love i like so i really do love a lot he's a nice guy but he really out of his love you on the air the only time he got upset with you was after you left you when i ended up with you one ten w s and uh for about two or three nights you really did a job on n w s and on said and one after noon i was i was i was so okay to you obviously one afternoon i was going into the uh studio and he was steaming in his office right up the studio they were nice i was a matter and he said i can't understand him i let him do what he wanted i like him he knows i like him and why is he clapping on me like that he really was upset that you'd crap on him because he really liked you i mean i talked about was the fact remember the uh was it metarial yeah the he was when he was on a metro he was the one he was trying to bring wash on send but he never stopped is he just said sometimes he thought he was going over boy he just um believe me that that was unfortunate but he always liked on the air there's no two ways about he used to tell me that one of the great things i was on from two to six and said would be in his office after five when most of the people had left so it would be basically him and me and the board up was ten miles away down the wall and i would often in that five of clock hour see i didn't realize in those days remember in the book from two to four i had these you had great numbers and i had great numbers two to four four to six like the audience would disappear from me and the reason being that two to four was still screaming in yelling time i'm trying to convince Steve of this four to six and Jerry Williams proved it when he came to end ws that year four to six is drive time they don't want grief they don't want screaming in yelling they want fun and games they want to have to want to you that that's what they want to hear the they've just had a rough day they're in that awful traffic they want fun and games so anyway you know and i'd be seeing they're trying to get the audience motivated in getting the phones to ring and here i'm talking basically there were a bunch of people over the age of a hundred anyway and i'm going on a pounding on the table you people just don't care about these things you can't do you is i said i don't care if you call i don't give a damn if you even listen and that little voice would come he'd be in his office which was right next door of the studio and there'd be in a Jason Doran i don't yeah i didn't think i could hear i'd be trying to be serious and i was just about crack up on the air because i'd hear it said i do i don't have a run you know and it was those were pretty interesting days there were and then we had some real great towns so Jim Altten who's the only talk host whoever had a street named after him as true i know i don't have to but you know you prove something in radio the last many years and i felt at long time ago even though i got that wonderful tag of the king of pap and dribble the yes when something exciting is happening like the riots something like that talk about it but i think talk shows all over the country overdo on this serious the new all the way around and when gbs was on a year doing talk here i mentioned this the other day here you had four stations doing all the same topic and that was that was such bad burnout and nobody lary can't have said this many times nobody ever calls it and says hey what you do another one of those great shows on a zone of those great education shows now we say remember the time that you you yelled at so and so they remember and enjoyed the fun stuff lary look proved it yeah and many others as well uh boka this must be one of your bill collectors in boka hello hi how are you Neil great i think you said it all but i was so disappointed the other night when i turned the radio on and crag was on and i's Sally was on i'm Sally's the nice person oh get on here we like Sally no it's not bad counselor without portfolio let's like brain surgeon without my favorite her radio show but i like Sally she's wonderful well they're a lot of nice people sit and i sky just keep them out of the business hello yes go ahead i'm sorry we're getting emotional and you know how it is well well i'm unhappy it's true i like her as a person but do not like her on ready especially let me get us to bread hotdog stand okay anything right after one ano i want to clock in the morning you don't want to hear all these depressing stories uh could really made me very happy to last in the middle of my just listening to him and i'm very unhappy about him not be a bia station man and i'll come work for you first thing i guarantee you i will and i come cheap i'm not like Neil with hundreds of thousands of dollars you can get me cheap you know i try to get the radio state uh the the end of the uh the smug the program director no one answers the phone oh what is that tell you i'm not on about an hour oh that is that tell you anything man i call three times and the you operate as a well you'll have to try later and then i'm so frustrated i turned on Neil and there you were well when you're really frustrated turn me on and i love a little bit of a thought they don't forget about all your other problems have a good day thank you okay boy you should give her short trip no i just thought you were going to anyway that was pregnant hung up on you you're i was enchanted with your calling if you believe that okay we are being a guest you know especially with you why oh because it's tough it is tough you like being a guest on somebody sure do you really when i used to hang around with call director midnight or with all that different you it was kind of a two way thing that's different but being a guest is an auto mind it anyway oh wait no matter what you say i'm gonna disperse anyway we have an open light in Palm Beach 655 Wio day why is Craig so nice and you're so mean see you were the one at start of that with me in this time oh i know but that's what i did hey Craig used to do that happen to me when i was Mr. Heavy i was the heavy weight in the afternoon and more ways than one and i was doing all the real i was i was the hatchet guy and i used to take all the abuse from those little old ladies over there and that's where it just our hat back then and i brought anything with all the money to get back at the same thing with call disorder but i made up for it's just all god yes believe you me and there's one of the beneficiaries of it right there boy he's been he's eaten more ever than last year skinny i know it which i hate i can't stand that i've been crazy i've never heard wild by the way that you and i used to kind of a point codified on yes well my dear my god sure pointless counterpoint it was point twenty four past eleven a wio do you hey let me tell you about new truss system right some of you Jeff this is fantastic pizza lots strikes again and what the hell am i gonna do you know wasn't i just saying at the beginning of the show that i'm gonna have a really really good day today during the jayton why didn't say anything well now we said and uh little antie pasta i'm just gonna have a little of this you're gonna love the shells okay trust me these are great well you go ahead and eat i have one or two things i want to ask crag and it's you're gonna have to bear with me because it's gonna take them a minute to answer my questions am i that long when didn't well no no no it's just gonna take you a minute to explain it by the way Dennis good morning how you doing oh i speak good i guess i'm trying to be friendly with am i know he's listening he's just monitoring right now you know yeah now it's not true that he used to have somebody taping my show every day is it i'm not that i am aware of that was a room i really am not aware of it honestly when i uh ran into you that softball game that night now it's talking to you about a guest that you had on your show over there the alien right can you tell us a little bit about the strange i had the alien finally rescheduled to do a show next Monday night but did you really i know this all things sounds ridiculous but i was working up on west palm and a guy call me one afternoon on the office and uh i've done shows with supposed extra terrestrial before and it's always stupid i've seen some of you guys do not believe but this guy kept me on the phone for like two or three hours said he was over he was here from another out of space but but but but but and he really didn't sound like a jerk so as after two hours i said what you do a show and he didn't tell me his name or where he was from anything else i said what you do a show with me hmm he said sure and i he said how about such and such and i we did a show for laughs and i figured what people gonna call it and say this is ridiculous and believe it or not 90% of the calls bought it yeah bought it and i'm saying friends this is this has to be a put on i'm sure it's some guy with a couple guys with buds out there drinking and have it i drove well over the since then we've done maybe a half a dozen shows in the last four years and whenever he calls me it's been about nine months since i've heard from him and i'm sure it's a big put on i don't believe and people from out of space whether they live here any place else with that matter but the amazing thing is that the majority of people who ever call in are talking to him like he really is you know and when i told you that night that i just couldn't give you the name because i didn't have the name a number the next time i talked to him i see if he wanted to do it and that was the extent of it was always on the phone he would like you couldn't call him could he help you never came i couldn't get him in this station never came in this day and he's never you know you figure after four years he's looking for something behind all this and his whole message behind everything is basically don't use i mean don't use collotoyle paper don't you basically yeah i what about colored toilet paper cozy well don't get me don't come on i i know you never forgot the code i did anything to i want to tell you if you people who are listening could have gone on a tour they should have turned that into a museum shouldn't they what is that building now is it's still a cruise line bought it really it's not in the way museum i could have been the curator of the museum the old indradible built around i'd smith is a curator with the uh... planetary and he was always a tight with jackrook hammer uh... anyway uh... it was a sternity of the internet and it was because when you walk and especially the talk studio and this huge old piano uh... band all great started this thing about to live at the correct come up with his little ladies toilet tissue cozy's which are that is how it's done with a little things that you put a rata roll of toilet paper in the wood wall i mean i'd never heard of that of them well even penis cozy's they sent in a whole bunch of those don't you remember those we got cozy's to come right every cosy's uh... the uh... the folks used to knit those uh... penis cozy's with the little uh... gonads on the don't you remember all those could be the auction line would just man is using a very uh... clinical language yeah that's what i mean compared to you i remember the real novice for me to forget something like that it's shocking okay it all started over a teapot because my mother used to have a cozy on a teapot that's how it started and then i get into the toilet paper ones the penis cozy's and and all the other things that they sent and we auction them off for charity i know is stupid but what they have do anything to get a little attention love that bird bath it's eleven thirty two a wild he homestead hello hi are you doing i'm doing good i craic either champagne ready i know you do a great one should know that call yesterday to station

something negative right yeah so i want to say this quick story i was working at chum and toronto and can't i know it well 10 worst two years my career and they have engineers up there that's why you don't run the records or anything just talk and they turn your microphone out of all well i had resigned that was about to go to stand you ago at that time in 1972 and i even thought to myself at the time on the air you don't be hope he don't be soapy i just say thanks for listening goodbye the last break the last show i opened my mouth say goodbye the turn the microphone out oh she's what are you serious i did see what says a lot for that company you know very corporate but they they would just scared to death i was going to come on for some reason i don't think you have to stay in there if
