I'm a cut man, I know but man, and I trust you are true. Yeah. Oh man, is this going to be something? Okay, 1006 to WIOD. It is so hot in this studio man, and this building, the air is out, we're working on a holiday. This is the last one I'm doing, okay? The last one that I'm doing. I know Steve does trivia on these holidays, and I'll be honest with you. I don't blame him. That's the most effort that he should be putting out. Oh look at this rich guy, a fan. Thank God, just sticking in front of my nose, okay? Man, I came in not feeling good to begin with. I felt like I was going to puke. I think it was psychological, you know, working on these holidays. See what they don't understand. Isn't it interesting how like Friday, midday, after everybody got paid, then place kind of bailed out, did you notice that? And now it's Monday, and all these douche bags are taking as long you extended holiday. I even working in poedunk places. I never heard of working on Moriel Day, and on the 4th of July, and all these other days, it's incredible. And poor, and on suckers, they got to be out of their mind. These guy, I'm here, man, working on suckers, they're nuts. Just crank it up. Where did you find that? Oh, thank God for that rich boy. Oh, what would we do without that rich? Is there any year coming? I think it's blowing the wrong way. It was making a lot of noise. That's good. Oh, great. Don't stop. Oh, and you hear the thing. Wow. Wow. He's just barely hear it. I don't care if it sounds like a wind tunnel, and making a difference to me. No, it's not working, Henry. Don't, you know, just calm down. 10-07, a W-I-O-D, and Henry's been crawling around on his hands in knees all morning in the newsroom, so that you can give you an idea. This is it. This is the end. I'm going on strike on the next and another fourth of July, I'll be on vacation anyway. That's yeah. Easy for you to say. Ha ha ha. That's right. You'll be on vacation that weekend. Relaxing the highlands. Where the hell is Highlands? North Carolina? Well, we don't care about that. I feel like cramp. I walk out the front door this morning. There's a snake on my front thing there. On my stoop, whatever you call it in front of your door. There's a snake. Not a big one, just a... Smollish one. Yep. Oh. What? It's falling. The fan is falling. It's a good thing. Maybe we'll have a fire in here or something. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. God, that would be the best thing that ever happened to this place. It's the only way we'll get any time off. I'll tell you that. Then we probably do the show from Channel 7. Oh, that's great. Oh, I thank God for fat rich. I just a little circulate. The thing is blowing hot air. We got enough hot air at WIO already. Okay. It's blowing hot air. See, now if the corporate bureaucratic assholes were here today, you can be danger. They'd have the AC people in here and the engineers would be up on a ceiling. We're on here all home. And it feels like death in here, man. This is pathetic. What the hell are we doing here today? Good question. And I got a Cubs game at 1 o'clock and we're trying to find WTBS. They're playing the braves in Atlanta. Why do you have to fight against WTS on this? 3 hours before the game. Have you had to find anything on this cable system? Well, yeah. Could be a point. This cable system is probably the half TVS. You know, it's probably not a KTLA. And Los Angeles is something without it locked. This is, is this goal coach? It's the weirdest one ever. Yeah, it's very, no expense. The green you're the very best. So this is going to be quite a show. They're going to get what they're paying for today. And buying on this here. Yeah. Oh, man. I felt like Pup coming in here. But now coming in and sitting in the blue and a hot air from the event. So the fan is circulating the hot air. He feels like we're in a swamp. Like we're doing the show from the Everglades. It might be what? Frozen? Do you got to cover it? It was turned off. It was turned off. It was turned off. It was turned off. Why was it turned off? What kind of moron do we got in this place? I wonder what he got. Oh, geez. Thank God for having me. Like I said. Hey, listen, is it really working? Yeah. It was turned off. What are they doing? Conserving now they're trying to save money. Oh, geez. Yeah. I got cold. Well, I saw their numbers. Okay. There is cold as ice. Screw them. They got cold. They turned it off. How do you like this? Yeah. Some moron over a GTR turns the whole unit off so we can all just Sfits over here all day on a holiday. What that nice? Yeah, thanks a lot. Okay. Thanks, guys. I mean, I grant it. You can't get much colder than your numbers. We saw him. I hope you go down to all one in the next trend. Turned it off and then when his when their shift is over, they just left. Yeah. They're worried about us at all. They're locked off the door. No, everybody else in a building can just Sfits. Yeah. I just said in a sauna bath and get sick and nauseous and pukes. I'm glad when you hear that music on GTR. Oh, God. I didn't think this fits in. Yeah, your mama. Or somebody's mama. Don't show me a skin, you want to show me a new skin. What's all these crazy questions you need? This is a craziest party that could help me. Don't go away. You're so... Mama told me that's cold. Mama told me that's cold. That's good. You ought to see what we're watching on. Perfect. I want to be, yes. Thank you for wanting to. I mean, like crazy to find the TBS, but this turns out to be PBS. It wasn't bad enough. We had Mr. Rogers with his sneakers on. This is how we got some ridiculous broad with a, what do you call it that she's wearing? Some kind of a kimona? Some kind of a goy-esher kimona that she's wearing with a thing of flowers. She's doing a little Kazaki. She's doing a swim. Where's Bobby Freeman? Look at that. She's saying, let's swim with Bobby Freeman. I don't like that. Oh, and that's Mr. Rogers' on there. Look at that. Oh, God. Nice. The one of the countries all screwed up. You can't watch it. This crap. This idiot with a sweater and a sneakers and all these bomb-douts zunked out. Got on there? No wonder America's going to hell in a hand basket. Oh, God. What do you want, sir? Deal. Yeah. How you doing? Well, these call. This is a good start. You hear the exact call? Well, I'm on a court that's sitting out here by the stream here. By the stream. I'm going to be a beautiful person. I'm going to be able to get a stream myself here in a second. So I hear this and I hope you don't get stuck. But I got to know the regional appears in newspapers. I'm on my one and four to one. I had to win three games in a row. And there was a really interesting game. Georgia Tech in Villanova was 18 to 16 in that game. So we'll go to solid pitching. Yeah. And in the canes, the one two yesterday, they beat Villanova four to one last night. So they're off to Omaha again. The one two yesterday? Yeah. Who'd it be yesterday? Go on over. Who was the first game? The first game was central Florida. Where's this call from? Highlands North Carolina. They don't have any news. No. No, no. And it comes one yesterday six to one. Balecchi had a shutout and it's thinking ugly Chris Sabo had another home run for the Reds. But it comes one at easily six to one. And Sean Dunst and drove in two more runs. So it's really exciting. I'm glad to hear that's what two favorite teams the Covey and Mike. The lucky when another complete game. Subcliffe pitch to complete game on Saturday and Balecchi. Complete game yesterday. Now we know that streak will end today because Derek Sanderson's starting for the Cubs and he never gets by the fifth inning. Never. Never. In the the Atlanta Journal of your all eight there's eight regional going on the country. They report on three and one from the. I don't know if you're. Did you know there was a revolution in China? Yeah, I heard that bird. Oh, that did get up there. You know there was a revolution United Stateser. Nathan Hale is going to be Steve's guest this afternoon. And then on sports star they got Barbara Hale coming in. Was it for Nantes who beat the gators? In the first game. Yeah, the go the gators. Yeah. And then they play for left field yesterday in the first game. He's just everywhere. All right. I'm glad to hear. Okay. Well, you got all the information we'll ever need. Sir and have a wonderful life. You said. Okay. Easy for you to say. What the hell. I'm serious. This is the last holiday. I mean, I might work like Tisha Boat. I'm not doing it. I am not doing it. It's ridiculous. Even like in West Palm Beach, we didn't work on these holidays. Oh, my. You know, once in a while, even the talent, even us mung brain talent need a little extra day to recharge our batteries. The Sally Fitzwood say. Oh, man. This is this is pathetic. Thank God for Henry Barrow man. And the only reason he did because he's been around here so long. He knows where everything is buried. That's right. That's who to go. The real reason he found he's got a bottle of stings. Where the unit is. Okay. That's where he doesn't tell everybody about it though. It's no surprise. Fifth race today. The bird is picking capital ABC with Castillo who won his first started Hialia. Did he run since then? I don't think so. The second start. And the night race. I see they got medieval victory with Steve Gaffleon on top. I'm passing him up as you would expect. And I'm going with one of my favorite horses. Billy O'Sage with a famous no rider. Oh, and the night race had calved her today. Of course, it's opening day of calved her today. And I got my past, my little pin here, my media pin. I wish I could get out there today, but the cubs come first. I hate to say it. But the cubs come for, I guess I could leave about 1230, huh? I don't know why you're laughing. I'm serious. I mean, I realize I could see the first hour here, but then I miss a whole half hour in a way home. Well, that's unacceptable, isn't it? Yes. You possibly. I mean, then you won't be here tomorrow. So what are playing tomorrow night? And there's a gear left there wandering around in the hallway. What the hell is going on? She's under two gear. We wonder what the hell is going on? See what it says on her clothes? Something about nasty boys. Yeah, assinating. Fascinating. Speaking of nasty boys, Ross will be in about, oh, I got to tell you an incredible story. Okay. Well, take the break when we get around. What? Okay? We know, hurry. We got no business today. Wait, it's a holiday. So what are we? Why don't we do it here? Why don't they leave us alone already? Okay? You idiot, Disney, why don't you leave us alone? You don't see him here today, do you? Notice. I could arrange it. I guarantee I could get him in here. You want to see me do that? Oh, okay. That's okay. Anyway, so I get a call. Oh, but far into the phone call. You see this piece of mail? Yeah, I'm curious about that. It has a return, stealth address stamped envelope in it. I'll do another story about Joe with seven ends after the break. Because he couldn't be listening to the, he's busy. Probably at a weenie, Ross like see this holiday. Unfortunately, has he generated like all other holidays in America to an excuse for everybody to get drunk. Yes. The only reason we have these holiday weeks areas, so everybody can get plowed and then I hear on the news, all these people got slaughtered in car accidents over the weekend. And in a great many of them, you know, drunk drivers, is that a surprise? Big surprise. I mean, you know, every other billboard coming to work is a booze billboard. Okay, no, I don't want to get Henry upset because he got the air back on. Hi, Neil. I enjoy you and your program. You always say, don't bug me on the tapes for Christmas, but after hearing the blast, you gave the guy for calling you the other day. Because he could call you about not receiving a tape. I feel on between a rock and a hard place. I see where this is going. Yeah. And he or her has his canceled check and he did this and on and on. So nice thing we got this when rich was here. I like that. I would appreciate you're checking on this for me. I checked. I don't have it. Okay. We don't know about it. We don't have it. And we don't want it. I mean, coherent. Well, I need to, I need at least another three four hour sleep and I need to leave early to see the comes of the planet game. This is unacceptable is what it is. It's just unacceptable. And I asked you about all the other marginal talent in the market. They're working today most of them. What does that tell you about the lowest there? I said talent. Oh, I'm sorry. Captain Dave was about there. Colonel has already had more days off. He's only been on the air like for six months over there. I already had more days off. Yeah, that's right. This is it for me. Never again. Never again. In fact, I'm, let me put it to this way. Any day that the high level bureaucrats have off for some hall. In other words, they won't take off for a simple store because they won't go anyway. But any day that they take off, I'm taking off. Okay. Simple as that. All right. Ten nineteen a WIO D. I don't do my job as well when I'm kind of stupid. Ha ha ha. Today, huh? Does that fit in here today? Twenty two after ten a WIO D. Hurricanes are off to Omaha. Guess I mean, sunny and Joe are off to Omaha. Well, that's probably a quick review. I heard Rick this morning say the WIO D will carry any evening or weekend games that the Hurricanes play in Omaha. Oh, now, you know what that means? Yeah. Means we don't get off. That's a crock of crap because I did the college world series for five years in a row. And I happened to know that they play many games in a morning like 11 30 games in early afternoon. Are you following me? Yes. Now, all I know would make any difference anyway for us would it now? Yeah, just a little bit because Omaha's two hours behind. Oh, that's really great. So they played 11 30. That would be 130. Well, if they had a 15 minute pre game show, 115, I'll take that. But God, they're too old. Steve would take it. That's right. But not here at the Aledreams man. We're just doing the least we can basically as a way it boils down. By the way, is anybody ever seen the California Angels? I don't want to get baseball intensive, but down KTLA out of Los Angeles. Have you ever seen any of the angels game? They were in Fenway yesterday. There was no crowd noise at all. It sounded like they were in a vacuum tube. And a guy who does the game, he's got one of these dick fatherly kind of boy. He is so bad. I mean, Joe Tories, okay, and the color. But you think Joe is spectacular because you just wish this other guy would never speak. He is so boring. And only wants to talk about he's kind of like somebody else we know about the SNS cafeteria. You know, only wants to talk about, oh, he had breakfast with the one this morning. And he said, uh, so and so. And then he was in a hotel and they were all getting ready. And somebody took a bite out of every one of the donuts on the table. One of the pictures on while he joined or told him that he had a cramp in his rear end. And oh, geez, honest, the God, the worst. The worst. Well, not the worst. He's no Bob Murphy. It's a 24. How about those meds, huh? Yeah. Well, now I'm starting to come back a little bit like those meds boy. They're looking tough. And I like that word that Rick Weaver had on the sports this morning. Have you ever heard you pronounce BALK? Balk, Balk. Balk. Roger, I'm a doll, Balk, didn't they? So, well, no, that was Rick's way. I don't blame him. I'm not a pro testing being here on a holiday. He's a comparative at two. He's been there forever. And now, the sunny and the share are off there in Omaha. So, no doubt, some of these other people going to have to work their tails off and they're getting pretty tired of it. Okay. I can't speak for them, you know. Well, Rick will come in and clarify. And then I heard Hank on Sports Talk Friday night making some idiotic comment to some guy about his book. He wouldn't say in bookie about betting on the game in the spread in the odds. And all this and then of course, well, of course, so you're going to be calling Las Vegas because we know it's illegal here. That was a cost-acrispons. That nobody else will respond to because in America, everybody in anybody can break the law when it comes to illegal gambling. That it's a big joke, okay. Somebody goes there here in 79th Street and picks up a hooker. Then right away, we're going to put him in jail for 30 years and probably, you know, have him on a front page of the Harold. Right? Mm-hmm. This is what I really appreciate putting this puppet show on the TV for a, like, say. There's Mr. Rogers while it's the Roger show, isn't it? Look at that. This is excellent. Yeah, and they talk about this show being a bad role model for the kids of America. Look at him. Okay. He looks, if he didn't have those heavy sneakers on, he'd float away. That sucker, look at her. Hi, boys and girls. Do you have a sweater? 25 past 10 at WIO Day. Look at all those calls on the board. Isn't that heartwarming? I couldn't give a damn less, okay. Always in his queue. That's not right. This Roger is a lady like this. Ooh, ooh, good. You're going to love this. Oh, and it's the whole thing too. And you know what he always says? I'm a cop, man. I don't mind that. But I trust you, Arto. I don't do my job as well when I'm constantly at it. Ha ha ha. Not bad. Almost. What's the clock? Oh, anybody can clock up for a Roger? I know. Is there stuff we're going to have? Yeah, it's going to be a beautiful day in this day. For a beautiful day for a name. Which you can watch if you be my name. I'm sorry. Listen kids, don't ever sit on my friend Roger's lap. I'll pay you right now. Okay, trust me. Don't ever, and if Fred Roger's place said, I run and call my Indiana Indian media with him. Okay, I'm a scream scream for your life. I don't always want to see man. What is Andy? What is Andy? Why? No, this is what we got like an open show. We got the door open. Murrow. And now here's a happy bridge. So I'm Halloween. This is somebody out there. Well, you shut up already, Fred. Get out of here. Here's a really interesting story in a paper. It says trainer John P. Puchek. Puchek. Who got into an altercation with Jockey Steed Gaffleon after Saturday's featured 10th race was fine. $500 something by the highly ass stewards. I wonder where Steve finished in that race in the 10th race. Oh, I don't know which was his horse. Okay, because Jabba Tinsky with Gonzalez wanted. And there were only six horses in the race. Oh, is it trian, even money shot that finished? Oh, fifth and a six horse race. Could that have been it trian? Trian, he went off even money and ran fifth. I bet you that was the one of Gaffleon had in the 10th race. Poor Steve, you know, he's a wonderful guy, but get serious. 28 past 10 at WI of Dean, it's getting a little cooler in here. Yeah, I have a second man by the time we leave it by the time I leave it 1230. I have something here of interest to you today. This is out of the new. I'll be for you to do that. I'll be for you to do that. I'll be for you to do that. I'll be for you to do that. What? Well, go ahead. It's a quote from our friend. Excuse me. Martha, I haven't even eaten anything. I've got a bad. I just feel nauseous from this room. I was a little under the weather when I came in. I think we need a class action suit against the company now for providing unsanitary worry. I think we got Legionnaires disease coming out of here. Thanks to the idiots of GTR. Okay. I can see the little virry running around there. Okay. Can't you? Well, it's Memorial Day. So we've talked about Legionnaires disease. Yeah, or would that be in portage? Okay. It's just a joke. All these veterans man to get so out of here. You hear what the what's his name was saying from GTR? Yeah. What is his name? McBean. Jim McBean. Bean. Bean. Yeah. So all the veterans are really up tight today. Well, of course they're up take because these two morons over here next or this morning were ragging on them. Said they should have all gotten killed in service or some nice thing. You know, as they usually do. Uh-oh. What is that? Oh, isn't that? Oh, thank you guys for whatever that is. But I'm not eating. Okay. Captain Jimmy. 29 past uh, time. If I ate man, you'd have a mess in here. You'd have a mess in here. You'd have a mess in here. You'd have a mess in here. You would drown. But we appreciate the Senate. Captain Jimmy's is here. That's wonderful. Some subs. Anyway, our friend Martha Plumpton. Now you know he related to George. Marty. We call her Martha Plumpton. Oh yeah. That's a river river. He needs a husband. Well, you're not going to believe this, but Martha Plumpton has shaved her head. And I heard he shaved his head too. For the new movie called Silence Like Glass. She shaved her head. He did. She did. It did. Wouldn't it be great if both of them shaved their heads then you really wouldn't have any idea what was going on. It's pretty touching go now. When you look at that pair, but if they both shaved their heads then you'd have no clue. You'd have to bring in like a gynecologist. Marty shaved her head. She goes to out. She says it's not easy to make friends in this situation. People don't know if you're bald because you're a skin head or because you're sick. That's the little quote from Martha Plumpton. I think sick is the operative work. Boy. 1030 a W.I.D. We hope you're having a great holiday weekend. And if you're going to get smashed, just hang around the house. Okay, just take a long chat at the bottom of the pool and stay off the road. There wasn't a lot of traffic this morning, but what was out there was really a mess, man. It was real snow. Oh, boy. Driving weird. Not like most of the other holidays when it's like almost clear sailing this morning. It was like they were running a little interference, especially on the set of 79th street in the highway. Slow. I mean, so slow. You have no idea. She could always depend on this town. I can give you any breaks. I shouldn't know how it was. My friend, Dordleef, working at was a snake on my doorstep. That should have been the first clue to stay the hell out there. Not a bad snake. Just a little snake. You know. A little snake. Yeah. I mean, I'm not too crazy about snakes, but it wasn't one that I started screaming and ran into a house and threw the dogs onto protect me. It wasn't that kind of snake. Oh. Just a little snake. A little snake. Plantation snake. A plantation snake. There are a lot of snakes in plantation. Okay. I shouldn't say that because I got my permit on my satellite. Like I said, I love plantations. And the politicians there are the greatest. And I love them to pieces. And look at that. There's a little. And at great. I talked about a snake and we got all these reptiles. TV. I missed a rod. There's this channel. I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. I brought it. That was the first Jewish dinosaur was a broad advice. I like this. It's 1031. I don't like this channel. Okay. The sooner we get it off. Can you go Fisher on earth see when you get TVS? Because it's already 1031. And a 105, the cubs in a braid. You can be too nervous. I'm not going to be discussing anything. I'm going to be watching a game I want to clock. Okay. If I have to be here that's bad enough. When a cubs play, nothing is more important in my life than the cubs. Okay. If they never win another game, the rest of the season. So far it's been so great. You have no idea. You're right. I have no idea. Even with that Andre Dawson, all of the quenching about Andre Dawson Andre's like a week away from coming back. Well, I know I've been sleeping real well. I have to. Until last night when somebody came home about a quarter to three in the morning, and I still would have slept through it. But he closes the door and tiny jumps off. My bed and goes running out into the house and starts barking and screaming and puking. And I wake up. And I've had it's been a rough weekend. I got all these mosquito bites the size of come quats. Yeah. They are manned. They're small now, but they were as big as watermelon's over the weekend. Well, tennis. But you get that crap all of a sudden. And then I woke up and I've been sleeping through it and then they started hurting. And I got this metacwick spray and back teen and all this other. And usually that works great. Not this weekend. It doesn't work at all. These holiday. Flange. Yeah. So for two hours, I lay there spraying and scratching and excruciating pain. And I think part of it was my Monday morning allergy. No one had to come in here. Well, that must be TBS. It's got cartoons on. Okay. And that's a V. Close. No one doubt only von MTV. I don't want to see that crap. They might have Steve Tyler on there and I'll see how badly Read it. Oh, I saw him the other day. Boy, is he ugly. Kimbo, you need some help. See, I always thought Steve Tyler was pretty good because you see him like a flash. You know, I mean like a fraction of a second at a time. Yeah. Now I know why real quick. Oh, he is so meous man. It's incredible. That must be it. It's loose. No, nobody else would carry loosey, especially now. Six. Is that six? It be. Who knows? If anybody knows what channel Gold Coast cable is on on on on on on with TBS and on the There, but you get flutters in your stomach. It's already 10.34. The game's at one. It's five. So you're real nervous. See, when it's in a landed, it's always 105. Because Ted Turner is you know, a little bit different. Yeah. You're part of that interview. Okay. Now I'm getting sick. I'll call from Parma O'Hio of all places. Hello. Hey Neil, I haven't received those pictures yet. Yeah, good luck to you. It'll be in the mail with your tape. I'm doing this morning. Okay. I'm sick as a dog. Are you know where Parma is? I know where Parma Michigan is. Now this is Parma O'Hio, where Big Wilson used to say that everyone wore a white socks. Yeah. We're home and up together. Who bad he didn't wear an eddy one. Jewish Federation television. He didn't think that. We don't waste. Now give me that thing. I don't want to show. Please. So anyway, it's a nice day in Cleveland here. I live in David. Not too far from where. Yeah, how about those Indians, huh? How about those Indians? Yeah. Would they lose a couple games? No, they won yesterday. They won yesterday. Ross, for an arrow. And what is it? 25. Oh, wait a minute. We just found WTBS here. Look at that. It's exciting as hell. I think it had hours away from the Cubs game. My God. I've been there. And Scott Sanderson's pitching day because we want to give the Braves a good chance. And we will. That's great. Who did they play? Who did it come to play? Let me say again, the Braves. We want to give them a chance. I'm not saying attention. Give them a little hearing problem up there in Parmesan. I know it's a long way. Pretty tough here. I know it's pretty hard for these signals to transmit all the way from here to Parmesan. Where is Parmesan near sir? Is that near Cleveland? Yes. Near Northfield. These are simple questions for simple questions. Let me say again, is it near Northfield where the race track is? No, it's on the other side. Oh, it's on the other side. Oh, it's on the other side. Thank God. Well, that race track. Oh, man. Here's to go. We got a tip on a horse at Northfield. I told the story before the name of the horse was Mr. Z. I'm going to make it up. Yes, that pass. And I should have known then that anything named Mr. Z from that point of my life would be a disaster. And we drove all the way from Detroit to Cleveland. We get to the track. We plunged our brains out. We bet him down to 3 to 1. He had the rail. It was the one horse. He never broke away six from the gate. He never improved his position to whole race. And it was a long trip back to Detroit. Jimny money at Iali. Yesterday they stopped racing there. What does that mean did I have any money there? I found a pigeon outside by door during the Cubs game. Yeah. And I said, here, take this over to Iali. They needed for the handle. I had no. Well, anyway, I want to thank you for the help. And as he left the track, he was smiling at the flamingo's and said, I just put everything I had on number two. Number two. Well, I want to thank you for bringing in your system. My last 54 pounds in four months. A good luck to you, sir. Well, it's too bad some of it was between your ears. But nothing. I can hear too well. I'll switch along this. Yeah, I know. Well, how was right day now? Bye. Say how to Big Wilson for us. OK. Oh, boy, what a place this is. OK. I'm we're going to fight out who the asshole is who turned the AC off in this building. All they had to do is turn the thermostat up to like 74. There'd be his warm as they could spits their brains out. It'd be like an Asana bat. But that wasn't good enough. OK. They couldn't just turn it up. They had to go to the main unit and shut the damn thing off. So everybody else could be uncomfortable throughout the rest of the weekend. And if it wasn't for the various student and we bear them, but I like when they just left them. What's their stupid stupid left? They'd be bit off. I like them. Just left. Yeah. I like screw everybody else. OK. I was warm. That's all that matter. Yeah. Boy. Those people over at GTR, man. They can't get arrested. No. Did you call that person that that an asshole is what you said? Well, that's very good. A serious asshole. OK. Not just your regular ordinary ordinary run of the mill. But a serious asshole. OK. It's 130 clear. Why? I'm so sick today. Man, you have no idea. I'm just nauseous. Nauseous. And I think it's like because yesterday I felt fine. Yeah. It has a problem. All weekend. I had a great weekend. It comes where scoring runs like it was coming out of a sieve. And everything was great. Are you nervous about the brave? Is that what the bottom of the news is? You're real nervous about the brave. You're really nervous about the brave. They did beat the cardinals two nights ago. And then lightning knew it. They tied it up and got rained out. So the you are nervous. And passing the cardinals are three games behind the cubs. I just mentioned that nervous. And then they're thinking Montreal man, how the hell did they swing that deal? I get they get this incredible picture. He's going to win about 25 games for him. Like Lankston, Mark Lankston. Well, whatever the hell you can call him anything you want. He's making so much money. Mark Lankston pitched a four hitter and struck out 12 yesterday. And his first game with Montreal. If you're a Seattle didn't need him. Seattle such a stellar team. They didn't need him anymore. So Montreal are probably win the whole damn thing now. It's 1038. W.I.R.D. You know, that's your amazing parrower. We got all his food kept in Jimmy's broad all his food. And then Arnold's a royal cancel bringing food later. And I have a feeling that nobody's going to show up here today that first stunk in a Todd. Didn't he say he was working today? We're not feeding him anymore. Okay, he's been shining us. Do he is working? Is he here? Oh. How do you know that? How does this guy knows everything? We don't know. We don't know anything. He knows everything. Okay, we take it all back, Todd. You're okay in my book. Anyway, Annie's here and Gail is here. Rogers here, very briefly. He'll be flying out of here the minute that Nick walks in the door. Chris Nick may not show up. And, oh, look at that. Matt's stick is running dayboy. And, Eli is Burman. And, buddy, hack it. We've already made our picks to Burlark. Can't let ABC in the fifth. I'm picking Billy O'Sage in the ninth, but boy, there's a... Oh, I'm going to get so sick. I'm going to get so sick. It's a salad. I mean, don't take it personally. The food is great, but I'm so sick to my stomach. And just watching you making a pig out of yourself. Well, look at that. My monodies is running today. Wow. All are favorites are running today. This isn't good. I'm cracking up. Oh, in the seventh. Naval Academy spelled with an E. I like that. What is this? This is great. Boy, I'd go on to call it today and just punch my guts out. Put it. And then there's Simon Casting the Metropolitan Handicap from Belmont today. It'll be the tenth race that they got. 12 races it called it today. My God, you could punch your guts out. Mori, pup, hey, hello. Hi, Neo. How are you? Hello. How do you think my Greece inform you of working? I was well when I was 12. 12 races. The tenth is the big race. Gary Stevens on the line is 8 to 5 in a morning line. Proper reality would jury Bailey seeking the gold with patty. He should only finish dead last that patty. Boy, do I dislike him? A lot. A trite M.T. with Chris Antley, finder's choice with the Kent. Desormol, how do you pronounce his name? That's a kid from Philadelphia. That's so good. Hot. How does a pistol? He's going to be the next Antley. The Somo. That is name? Whatever the hell of it. Dancing free with no rider forever silver with Julie Cron. And it's academic with the famous no rider. Boy, all I care is that seeking the gold finishes way back with patty. He's going to be the next one. I'm going to have some excuse. Yeah, I'll have to follow against the rest of the field for running too fast. But I really enjoyed the phone calls this morning. What? What? What? I'm so out of it. You have no idea. This company man, what they understand about giving you a little time to regain your sanity. And of course, remember, I should have already had a week's vacation. But I had a postponate because we've got that simple tin back there in the sales office. I don't want to start you on a linen fried ass. But she had a, you know, caused me to postpone my whole vacation. And then she tried to pull it again. She tried to pull it again. She said, well, how about the week after this for a month? I said, wait a minute. Doesn't it dawn on you that already told you that I was going to be on vacation that week? No. She'll do anything to screw up your life that woman. She will do anything in her power to screw up your life. Here's a tape that just came in. Boy, we just got all kinds of stuff coming in. Oh, this is probably for you, Rich. It's called Rob's Moon. Oh, God. Or Rob. It's another Rob low tape. Well, it's professionally recorded by Studio 109. Her studio, I don't get it. Studio 109 is it? Oh, it's Lakanto Productions. So it's Franklin Conto. So we know it's going to be what? Specialty song. Yes. But I'll produce for this show. 1053, we mail an apology to GTR because there's somebody over there for turning the air off. Because maybe the unit is busted and they went in there and they shut it off on purpose because it's boiling and Roger Studio in a control room. It's boiling. It's boiling. Henry thought he really had it fixed. And we appreciate Henry's efforts. He's staggered back into the news booth. But the matter of fact, I see Gail was going to be doing the 11 o'clock news. Henry is a little bit of a little. And let's all. So we probably owe the apology to GTR, but we aren't going to give one because there are a bunch of douchebags anywhere. Right? Well, yeah, they deserve a shot. Especially that spike wise who's a real puts. It's 10, in fact, if you look up puts in the dictionary, you see spike wise is picking right when you look like silly grin idiotic haircut. 1054, W.I.O.D. We have an open line in Boko. We haven't even given the numbers down. We already got seven stinking calls on the line. He likes that one. He's talking a long distance calls. Are incredible. From the big city like Parma, Ohio, where they said, I'm dying on my chair. Murray, put the call. Hurry. Put the junior. And of course, Phil's also. Oh, man. He was also Lee two hours and 11 minutes away from broadcast time. The game I guess would be 115. Uh-oh. Are you going to be okay? No. He's in at 2 o'clock, then I got to drive home. It takes me at least 40 minutes. And I can't hear it on a radio. Boy, what are you going to do? I can't take that 40 minutes. What are you imagine? All the runs at Sanderson could give up in 40 minutes. I can just see Murphy hitting one that's still on a weight like two. Aintree, Georgia. That's Scott Sanderson boy. And I hit the amazing part of it is he's got the best record on the team. He's five and two. Don't ask me how. Got the highest during run ever. He sucks. But he's five and two. So much liver, right, I guess. He's okay for five. Meet desperate innings. Five struggling desperate innings. But we want to especially salute Sean Dunston for that Clutch it again yesterday. Well, Sean's motto is, I may not hit off in, but I hit one account. Okay. Like once every tissue buff, stupid stuff on the facts. Yeah, you people out there who are stupid don't bother us. Are they okay from Papito? Great. Papito, go away. Well, yeah. Leave us alone. Well, you bugged me. Okay, go away. And speaking of go away. So Friday morning we had a call on the air from a stunned and shot Joe with six ends, remember? Sure. We hadn't heard from in weeks and weeks and weeks, suspiciously with all these things we've been hearing. And he asked me with very, a Friday call me at home yesterday or a Friday afternoon. And wondering what I was talking about with the CIA and all the other stuff, and I told him all these little rumors I've been hearing about him being an Ojo on Provacatur. And then his story about this guy following for my house to his work and the story keeps embellishing and then he allegedly got a call from the same guy at home asking if he knew New New Rogers and the guy hung up the phone and where am I going on vacation? So, I invited him to go with me just to see what the reaction would be. And what was the reaction? Well, he's got another job. I had just pretty strange, you know, pretty bizarre. So I think I'm going to like to Lakeland on vacation instead. I'm not going to change the twice already. And I think I'm going to change it again because I think if I went to where originally was going to, I think I get on a plane and look at there be like 30 other familiar faces on the airplane with me just wanting to make sure everything is kosher. I just, I'm not into that at all. I travel alone. So, I don't know what history is, but it just gets, it's a little bit too bizarre for me, okay? I just don't know what it's getting more complicated and more and tell us if this day goes by. So, Jo, it's been nice, but give it a rest. 1057 at WIOD, here's my Emma. Hello, what do you want sir? I'm dying of... No, no, no. By the way, would be nice to do it now and go home, but not yet. Now, this is the perfect day for me to tell you this. You know, my vacation? Mm-hmm. Now, I think you knew this from the very beginning. Deep down inside. I'm dying of it here. Exactly. It's not going to happen. And I'm going to tell you today today's the perfect day to tell you. Upstate New York without going into all the details. You knew that. It's not going to happen. Wait a minute, we carted his jobs. Is that what you did in the cart? No? It's bad? Oh. Bad. Yeah. Tough day. Yeah, and they delivered it all the way over here. Well, we're sorry. So, you're not going to... Didn't you know... No? It wasn't going to happen. Why not? I don't want to go into all the details, but, you know, vacations are supposed to be fun. Maybe Joel go with you. No, I hadn't thought of that. Yeah. I can kind of monitor your activity. Oh, well, I like Joel's little joke, but he's coming in here when you go and vacation to see me. Yeah. That's a real funny thing. Well, he's going to be busy with his new job. Oh, okay. So, all these people that are going away, please don't waste any time, okay? Like, Stam is going to sleep away camp. Yeah. To be conscious, okay? Now, when you were almost 20 years old, did you always sleep away? Yeah. Sleep away camp. In Jersey. Oh, my. That's like going to sleep away camp in Tamarack. I'm sure. On a tamarack when they go to camp, it's for a long rest. It does. It is a new work, is it? Oh, I don't think that good. He's going to sleep away. Where do I find these people? And how do they find me? That's the real question. Interesting. Yeah. But it's been nice knowing all of them. 10 59. What an hour. Oh, man. So you have no idea. Sick to my stomach. What do we have in a one o'clock hour, by the way? We've got a lot of live stuff in there that we could jam in before. And I'm going home early. I'm telling you right now. I think he is. I really think he is. And everybody's just, oh, it's close to the cubs game. I got news for you. I mean, I didn't even watch the game. I may just go home and lay down and sleep. Put the tape on. I think you are leaving her. I may. I just do it. Just out of the sauce. One strike. They got some goddamn nerve. Bring us in here on Memorial Day. Boy, boy, are they without conscience? You know, even when they are here, they're not playing golf and the jerking around when they are here, you know? Anyway, Henry is already on his way. I'll watch out for him if you're driving. Gail not so bright has the 11 o'clock news. And richened at the bird. He'll be back and maybe me at 11.05. I'm going to go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Okay, it's 11.05 in WildD. And we're only two hours away from game time. No. Oh, man. We've got the fan. So Henry, we appreciate your efforts. But it wasn't the. Now, it was not the solution to our problem. Okay. The whole unit is buckocked. As they say in China. Isn't that what Boon said? He said something about this building. You said it's buckocked. And it's exactly like everything else. It happens on a holiday. But they can't do jimmies for the great spread. They're wonderful folks. Yeah. I brought by delicious stuff. Just numerous times. And I had a little slice of dill pickle there. And I'm not sure whether I'm getting sick or better. It was very good as always. And I am really erected. You know, it could be. You think that when you get these enormous mosquito bites. And it gets in your system. No. No. I mean, like a whole bunch of them. I can't make you nauseous. When you can spring it with that stuff for hours and hours. I don't think so. And inhaling that awful cramp, I didn't help. But I woke up weird this morning too. Because I feel like I'm going to breast any minute here. Like all of these CDs. Well, about 105, I think you may come out of it. You know, for now. Now, what's Anderson pitching? I'm going to get a lot sicker. Oh, he is deadly. Scott Sanderson. Well, I guess they wanted to. How come Maddox isn't pitching today? Is there anybody out there who has any idea what's going on? The rotation is all screwed up now because subtly if Mr. Turnn with that back thing. In fact, Sandberg, Mr. Gameister, and we still want. How do you like that? No, Dawson, no Sandberg and it comes still blew away the reds. How do you like that? No, it's just like Routisserie Baseball. If that norm can, don't stop bugging me about Routisserie Baseball and Altacaca Baseball. He's driving me nuts. He wants to be president now of the South Florida shuffleboard league. And I said, how about Routisserie shuffleboard? Yeah, what a great idea. I want to hire me an Irving from Wimor on my day. They're the best. Oh, look at that Irving got a nine. It's 11 o'clock at WIOD. We may take a couple of calls this hour too. Really? Or we might just, uh... Wow. Oh, you sure haven't heard from this guy a long time ago. He's going to finish him the woodwork. Kind of like holiday music. It's the same. I feel like I'm dead. My death or king. Oh. Isn't it low? Real low. It is. I got a crack wide open. There's no feedback. I'm telling you, I'm going on strike on Mondays. Okay, you can go through Monday. I just, this, every Monday is traumatic. Yeah. Because the weekend crew has been in here, uh, oh, geez. It looks so good, you know what? But I have a feeling if I eat it, it may make you feel better. Oh, good. Rest. Oh, nice. I make you feel a little better. Or let me try one. Oh, now look at what he's doing. You know, you, you may. He's trying to play Mr. Hero here with a hero sandwich. And he's like, um, scoping all the insides out and tossing the bread out. Like he's going to impress us. Like Linda might be listening from Nutri system. Well, I might take a little bite. Okay, just as one thing. I think it's going to be a mistake. No, I don't think so. Really don't. From nauseous now. I am real nice. Stabilize you a little may help to. Or from from? Yeah, may stabilize you. A little solid food. I mean, yeah. Well, we're on the countdown here. It's like an hour, 56 minutes now. So, you know, you get a lot of pressure. How about that Mike Baleckie, huh? I've got an earned one average of about 1.6 now. Okay. And nobody, there was one of these sports shows on last night. I think it was on. There was on this station. Uh oh. It's on before that idiot costist. One thing I'll say, you know, it's almost impossible to be universally dislike. Usually somebody likes, I don't know anybody likes costas. Even big day hates costas because you know, he stays up and watches Letterman. Yeah. So I guess he's seen some of that afterwards. And he hates him. Hey. Why? Watch a little wisest snobby pseudo into a puts. Well, that doesn't watch the sports shows he does. Oh, yeah. God, do I. Oh, so he anyway, he was doing a game Saturday because NBC. Oh, man. Where the God? Now, did they tell a wise that game here? Or did they tell a wise that Yankee game? On NBC. See, because if you didn't have, if I didn't have the satellite dish, I would have missed a cubs game because it was not the primary game. But on F-212, which is W-X-I-A in Atlanta. NBC, there was Bob Costa Snowless. Oh, wow. And Tony pardon me for being a goofball, Kubak. Since that ball hit him in the throat in the 60 World Series, he's never been the Sees speaks with a quaggle. Dicky Thun, Dicky Thun. It's 11 past 11 at W-I-O-D. We're just having a hell of a good time. And I'm so happy to be here. You can't imagine. And we hope you're having a great holiday weekend wherever you are. And don't forget, make those w-inies real hot before your pop a million miles. Okay? Anyway, this is good, you know, but I'm just going to have to eat in real small. Yeah, I am. Exactly. Because I don't want to breath. We're even worse than that. I don't want to have another Oakland episode. Yeah. That's right. Now, one good thing the building is pretty well cleared out. Yeah, it's right. It's a clear one. Or that used to really frost my something. Remember at the other building? Once it'll wild, it'd be a full house. And they would say, well, go in to back to the building. Ron Harrison's got his own set up. And I'd say, you don't understand. I'm never going to make it all the way back there. Members, ladies, tell their staff meetings in the public restroom. Remember that? When we were on INC and... Oh, yeah. Definitely. Staff meetings in the restroom. And you couldn't get in. With Jeff Chase used to be kind of like the pivot man in that meeting. But as true, they had a locker room. That's what sport he does on another sports channel. Tenons. Yeah. Your favorite. Yeah, my favorite. I've never had something symbolic about. No, they're... That's the thing. That's the thing. I don't think. Okay, 11.15. Ah. That WIOD. Isn't that interesting? What? I'm just looking at this little thing here. Anyway, let's take a call or two. And then we'll do another break. Before you know, it'll be... Come on, it's baseball time. Now, you're going to do play that play? Can't do play that play. It's illegal. Oh, two bad. But you can do it in the past tense. Oh. Kind of like White White used to do with the reds. Past tense. Mm-hmm. And, oh, talk about horrendous John Sterling. And who's the goofball? It does, uh, Jade John Stone. For the Yankees game's unestation, the absolute worst. And they keep trying to be funny and they're not like a lot of people in this market on the air. Yeah, but I wouldn't say that the worst. They're not as exciting as, uh, Harry Callison Philadelphia. He sounds like he went into coma 400 years ago. He's like a cross between Byram's and Bob Ellson. He's always talking like this. Ah. Nobody cares. I'm looking forward to when you give somebody's name that I know. I can't help it. Did you done the way I think, except, uh, Phoebe Caches boobs, okay? I'm not my problem. Hollywood, hello. Hello, the old, you know, this is Dick. Oh, my. Hollywood, hello. Greenberg. Yeah, these calls have been, well, astounding. Yeah. Greenberg. I can't hear anything. Hello. Greenberg. What do you want, sir? Hello, more than Neil. You're on for a story this morning. What do you want? Okay. I hope you have any good, um, um, a royal holiday. Yeah, does it sound like a man? I'm sick as a dog, sir. I'm ready to kill you. Yeah. Okay. It's going to be some good material. Are you ready for this? We're listening already. My God. Is somebody have to hit you with a, with a dorn-ob. What's the story? Let's go. Okay. I heard Ricky Tickey on Antique Time. How much is Tapis worth? Boy, like I said. You know, all you pain in the ass people are usually at work or doing something useful. I'm not going to rest. Don't call us today. Okay. We got plenty of calls. Don't call in here today. Oh, my God. I'm going to tell you one more time. This is the purpose of calling the show is not to try to be a comedian. Okay. Because you're not funny. Oh, man. God, those people make me sick. You know what? I was sick to begin with. Hmm. Okay. The starting line-ups for today's game. Leon Durham at first base for the cubs. Ernie Banks had short. Glenn Becker at second. How many ends do you have? Six, six ends. Okay. Go ahead. Laund Santa with third. How do you like that? Laund who? Santa. Santa. Okay. You're a full brother to Jose Santos. Hmm. Hmm. It's 11, 19 at WIO, dude. Or hack Wilson behind a plate. Hack. Oh, bring some of the old cubs back today. We want to give the braves a fight in chance. North Miami. Hello. Any other one? Yeah. I was going. Great. I'm sick, pal. I'm sick. I should be home resting. Watching a ball game relaxing. You don't see any of these bureaucrat assholes in the building here today. They're all off, man. They're all on a long bus mentality. And just like we're supposed to show up every stink in day man. These people have got a real something coming. Even on Zeta they used to ask us, would you like off this day? They'd name it on Zeta, not here. Oh. Oh, wow. Screw them. They got a crappy attitude, pal. Yeah. I'm not sure if you can get some free of cover game. I got two solutions here. Number one, if you want to get there at the station, you can leave here here. I'm going to play the car over and over. Yeah. You want to mean? Uh-huh. Or what else you can do is when you get down to your car when you go to the leaves. Have a big game and have them put the phone up to the team. Yeah. I never thought about that. That's a good idea. That'll cost me about $100 going home. That's true. You think he's going to be awake at 2 o'clock while you're dreaming? No. Probably taking a long nap for about 15 hours. No, it isn't. I want to go on Sam. Can you hear anything on this over here? Very little. Is that the fan? Is that I can hear it? It's just real low. I want to hear the fan. I'll share it there today. Mm-hmm. I want to say I was going to disappoint you here on the festival. There's nobody here today. Huh? You were disappointed in her what? I'm professional attitude. What she said the other day about what's his name? Ross. On the air, that's not, you know. I forced her to repeat it on the air because she said it off the air. And I figured if she said it off the air, the leash you could do is repeat it. And you know, not take shots behind his back. Yeah. But the worst part of it is Ross is a great looking guy. And for her to say that, I mean if we're true of the okay. But he's tremendous. Okay. I mean, I don't know what he's like, you know. Around the farm. Around here he looks like I'm, you know. But I can't believe it. But I'm just saying the point is not only was it a cheap shop, but it's not true. She should only be so lucky to get anybody. She looked like that. She should kiss the ground if anybody looked like they even looked at her. Hey, I could have a much just to look at her. Sharon? Yeah. No, you don't. Get out of here. She's what? Yeah. Oh, man, you really get out of here. Yes, no. I do what he's talking about. Sharon's a nice lady. But she's hot. He's no idea. She doesn't go to the remote. Does she was at one, I'd want maybe. He doesn't even know what he's talking about one of the others, which makes it his comment. That's a very interesting. A salesperson, maybe. Yeah. Think about it. A little squirrely one. Uh-huh. Kind of a female. Bop, bop, bop, bop, bop. Bop. Okay, he's trying to screw up my life in my vacation. She just can't. She isn't satisfied unless she's messing around. I've got a whole bunch of dates for this remote. I've got a hubby engine. She gives me one. It's already booked, you know. The only date she could possibly give me. That would have created a problem. Sharon, off that's the one she's got. Okay. Boy, she is. She's even making Bill Mullin look pretty good. Nobody ever dream that. Wow. Nobody ever dream that could. Whoa. What does that tell ya? Good. Well, it's 11.22. I got my shoes off. Look at all the mosquitoes. Can you see all the bites on my feet? Wow, they're kind of like subdued at the moment. I'm just abitting the pieces. I'm a wreck. A mess. Yeah. You are. Anyway, let's talk about the Salmo's now. Pizza and Italian restaurant. Here's the good news. We got, I mentioned before, Trapper's Ali, which is in plantation. Mm-hmm. The shocking news is we now have these Salvos in plantation. What? I know it's a shock. In fact, the best part of it is it's right in front of my old favorite wind Dixie there on Sunrise in Pine Island. Mm-hmm. In Jackaranda Square. And it is tremendous. If you like a great family style Italian food and the Salvos is for you. In fact, do we got some takeout from there the other day? Didn't make a big similar about it.

I swear I'm going south to day. Today. Today. Today. Today. Today. Today. Today. Hmm. It's eleven thirty in Wild and Wild. And while we're sure glad to be with you here. Oh, I'm holiday man. This is what life is all about. I'll tell you. And those of you on Memorial Day. If this is the best you've got to do is to be hanging around listening to the show. God help you. My amy. Hello. Oh, great. Listen to cup. They're a lot today. Yeah. The brave set in the dugout for an hour and a half that rain delay left before the head of get on a plane. So they got to be pretty tired today. They're going to give to get a performance. Isn't that a shame? Yeah. Now listen. Don't forget those. God's Anderson starting. So everybody still got a chance. Well, yeah. But they've been ripping lefties all year. The cubs. Yeah. One thing that's sunny. Is there room at sunny shade decided to say with a lightning bolt? Why? Didn't you see what happened? Yes. They would be your king. They shaved all their heads on the side. Yeah. Well, Kirk dual them started that and then the rest of jump on a bandway. I thought. And then he hit the home run. That's right. Listen. What about the skipper. Medellis who tigers? What about him? They beat the number one team in the country. Two games in a row. You have to win their confidence. Well, I'm pretty excited about that. I know you would be at one thing. You know when you consider the WI-O-D is going to bring you all evening and weekend the world series games that the Cains play that goes to show you the tremendous commitment that our sports department here has to the hurricane baseball program. Well, I'm going to let's know one of those games. Neil, did you hear when the interview was Michael Jordan? I do a day about the MPP given away to Magic Johnson. No. He said to and I quote, he didn't want to be an old zoom provoked to her. But he thinks it was rigged. Yeah. How did I say? Okay. Do you want to be one? I can't hear anything on here. Can you go on this overhead? It's so low. Well, that one I was kind of glad about. But I read what you said. I kind of wanted to hear. But that one didn't matter. Miami. Hello. How are you doing today? Okay. The winner whisper I can't hear you at all. He's far as fan and is overhead, which is like on terminally off. I'll crank it up a little louder. I'm in. Okay. There we go. I was sick this weekend. So I stayed home both days and I was listening to the radio. That best of cane is terminal. Oh, no, what do you were sick? I mean, that didn't help at all. That's like Santa's in pitching today. What do you have on yesterday? He had on some. Some Rabbi who's changed most while he's doing abortion. What was that? The North was a hero like Oliver Norris. The Cluxx claim and from Louisiana. He said he was a hero also. The guy named the Colonel, but he was an honor and a honorary. The Colonel. The Colonel. No, I don't know why. Not the Zeta Colonel. But that explains that the Colonel makes me sick. Well, and then, you know, then I caught the sports talk. Who host those sports talk this weekend? Did you guys rub Norris? You know? I don't know. You think man. Found it. Hum was a manage. He sounded just like Al Ranto. Oh, come on. I'm serious. Manage is a good guy. I'm sorry. I'm not a great blockhead. It's a good guy. And just as I was getting over it, somebody called and said the club sucked. It was the most incredible thing. Well, I got news work. They can say it all day. But they're in first place by two and a half. No, no. I was a game. They lost the Cincinnati. That read. Oh, again, that they blew the seven. No, they didn't lose to reload. They wanted to be lost. They blew the lead. Seven and two and a blue and they lost 10 to eight. Well, that's because Zimmer left Pilgrison too long. But you can't second guess, Zimmer. Okay. He's been great all year. He's not perfect. But he certainly doesn't incredible job. It can't be a bad. And you look when you look like that and you can win 27 games, man. You got to be okay, my book. That's right. Because it can't be as bad as everybody thinks. That's for sure. And just wait to see Sanderson today. See, could this prove that, sir? Believe me. I got nothing but confidence in him. Oh, God, Lord. Well, that's just called to give you a little story there. And Zeta, I thought to Kimba, who works the evening shift. Yeah. Yeah. I don't remember. I'm sorry. I heard she has a Zeta's name. I could, I wanted to know. Well, that's why they put her on. And they want somebody who has a sense of humor every Friday when she gets her paycheck. Uh-huh. And I, I asked her, you know, hey, you know, I called her Thursday. They before you got into the rating show. I think the day before he did the rating show. I can't remember what day it was. And I go, oh, you can listen because you go, no, I never listened. I go, right. Has she never listened to this show? Right. Well, no, Kimba doesn't have the intellect to listen to this show. She wouldn't understand it. Oh. And then I go, well, you know, you think if I sent a tape to roll, hold your hill with him. I mean, anybody who thinks that Steve Tyler looks like God. If there, there's a guy who lives like a flatfish, okay? The man is ugly. Oh, he is gruesome. The man is ugly. He had me kind of to believe it. He was good looking. And then those videos, you see him like for a tenth of a second. You know, and now that I saw him the other day for, like, actually sitting down and looking straight ahead for like 10 seconds, I think that's why I'm so nauseous today. He is gruesome. I want to add one to the all ugly team. He makes you a barrel. Look like Roblo. He makes you a barrel. Look like Craig Bijo. Carmen, who? Carmen, fun zone. You can't say that, sir. I can't. You don't zone. I think they have that it disalbo for lunch. No, no, no, this that place for the cubs many years ago. Felt cone. Felt cone. Not fun zone. I'm sorry for giving me a lot of these cubs. No, I'm not a cubs, but I'm trying. You know, that's before I was a cubs. I don't know any of those cubs. Okay, you're any banks and all those other marginal players. I don't know any of those people. Well, I know. I know you can't wait to leave. I know it's 12 30. You'll be gone. I couldn't. I might be. I could be. I am out of here. I like to tell my wife to get a life. Okay. Thank you, sir, for your incredibly pondress call. It's, uh, 35. He was okay. Leave him alone. Okay. Kill some time. Yeah, that's true. This is murder today, man. Every minute is like an hour. It's kind of like watching the mets. We have an open line in Palm Beach, 655 WIOD. How about those mets? I'd Dave Maggett and at first. Wow. And the Mackie's sasser behind a plate. Well, they got some real heavy duty guys on that team. And the doctors can't get another win. You know, the day didn't lose the game. I stayed with him getting to Sydney. Just can't, uh, and they were hitting the crap out of him all through the game. Man, he's lucky to lose it. That the boat doctor. I mean, when you can't beat Fernando Valenzuela, who has to want to gain since last June, you know, you got a problem. Okay. It's called Anemia, batting Anemia. And then poor Davey Johnson, they kept slapping his face back together yesterday. And they kept dripping apart, you know, and they had to keep running around to pick the pieces up out there. And LA was disgusting. It's 24 till noon at a WIT. Don't knock it man. At the time is flying by. Take your vitamins and just. I mean, I don't wish Brian any bad. But nothing. You know, on a sick, crazy stomach listing to blind. We'll just know that Brian, you're a great guy. But go back to bed. Okay. Twenty till noon on Memorial Day, 1989, a day that will live in the halls of shame forever and ever. Look at that speaking of halls of shame. Just dig right in there, Todd. We thought we're going to get shined again today. Okay. Just don't mind us. We're all sick and ready to puke all over the place. So take it real quick. The air is off. Okay, man. The air is on. That's that one. You're going to take. Okay. We got Castle burgers coming later. Okay. So good luck to you, Todd. Todd's in here in his underpants is that cute. And it doesn't even phase me. So you know, I must be really sick. Miami. Hello. Hi. Hi. This is a Coleman fire towards. Oh, yeah. Yes. Right. There. Another one of our brain surgeon salespeople in the WIT sales department. Right. Last Friday morning, you said that you told you that his car died or some something. Yeah. Well, he writes. He's eating around eight o'clock. We saw him at. Poppies and clothes. And one. Poppies and the girl that's a gourmet wine and tea. Space and space. Also he had something better come up. I guess. Well, I got news for a boy. He did be a big favor because I had a great meal of trapezole and it were very nice. And, you know, I ate in solitude and in peace and with delicious and I didn't have to listen to any of his BS. He was last, right? You bet you was great. I just went to know that. Okay. He lied to you. Not Coleman. Yeah. Coleman? Yep. We have a do not understand. Did it was at five o'clock? Well, I didn't realize it was that early. I'm sorry then. But he was there. So maybe maybe he's called it. Yeah, maybe his car did die. But we can only hope. But only hope so. So we get it. Why did you turn that fan down? Don't you want to get it so loud? I don't care how loud it is. It's a lot more important to be cool and hear these colors. I don't think that personally. Okay. Have a good one. You too. Bye. Two of a point there. Yeah. Actually this crowd. I thought about that. No, you didn't notice it was still low when he turned it off. Turn it down. But I was thinking I got to crank up much higher than usual. It's still low. Can't hear us. It's a blessing sometimes. Yeah. Well, it's Monday. And we don't have the engineers aren't here and all the, uh, the head macho, and all these important important people. And so you just kind of do like a slip shot, paste it all together and hope for the best. You know, kind of like the way Rick we were to the sports this morning. For a lot of day. Hello. Hey, I do. Great. That question for you. You track today. Are you going to show the, uh, come to game on the. He's either. Cubs game. Are you out of your mind? They've got, uh, I don't know. A bunch of money. It's been a renovations there to show us. Oh, I just possible it. I don't know. Let's see. They're in North day. They're probably, unless they got their own satellite dish. They must have a satellite dish because they got a, uh, the, the simultaneous from Belmont. Yeah. So it's possible. Is it? Hello, what do they need? Therefore, it's on channel 11 and a. So it's probably it's probably going to be on. I don't know. The, the TV gen is in North Miami anymore. But it's, it's on it landed today. So next three days are on, um, PBS. So it should be on there and not Tom's a turn it on. Yeah. I can't hear this car. I can't hear anything. Oh, God. Why is that? I got another thing. You're from the sunrise area, right? I'm from the sunrise area. Like I saw you out of your mind. What? I wasn't told. No. What are you this? In plantation. Okay. You're from around the area where the Mercedes movie theater is. Yeah. I want to watch the basketball game there. Tuesday night. I was Tuesday night, right? I had a sports bar in that. I'm not going to give the name of it. It's in the area there. Yeah. They're a little complex. Go in there. They have a six foot screen. They have a thousand thousand sports bar. They got the basketball shot through a table. From nine yards. Yeah. There's just one thing that we say. They're not showing the game. They're showing the Clint Eastwood movie. No, that's good. They don't have cable. The sports bar doesn't have cable. How soon? I took Clint Eastwood. He's a pretty sports intensive dude. Yeah. He's a good sport. How soon is the house in the house? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? I can't hear a word you're saying. How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? How soon? I can keep walking. I can keep walking. Still shooting. Now just doesn't make any difference. I'm toofter waiting for that one. Has seven generals left, it can't help, but.gress view transformative вещ not all of time. How often? wanncs go in and getFBE on. We got resonance on death. Former 4 inter然 to Unit. they could ever get their damn act together. We, you know, now you want to show a quick the air conditioning's fixed tomorrow. Oh yeah, like like a shot like a shot. You bet it'll be there might be it over in Carroll City. I remember I never forget it. The air was out in the whole building. It was like a sauna bath in there. Where do you think they were working first to get it fixed in Gary Lawrence's office? Or they had it. You could have hung meat in there. They had so cold by it within an hour. Okay. And we were up in the other end of the building. Svitzing our brains out. Okay. Svitzing. Allen. Oh, now come on. Somebody told us yesterday that Allen hates us. No, I don't think you guys need. That's what the rumor was. Allen that you hate us like poison. God, who would say something like that? One of your great friends probably. Somebody that spit on my car, you know. Hate them. I hate them. He people. I thought he did us. Are you doing yo? No, you don't know Joe, do you? Joe? Joe. With four ends. And he claims to know you. I think he went to Cooper City. He works at the Sheridan 7 movie theater. Oh, I know Joe. I saw Joe in the other night. Did ya? What's his story anyway? Is he becoming a scoundrel spy or what is his deal? I don't know. What was he doing? I don't know. Something there that just doesn't meet the eye would show. You know what? I just can't figure him out. I don't know. I saw him at the movie theater. Why'd you think? But I went to brick oven pizza yesterday. Yeah. Now, don't get surly. Allen sounds pretty good. Is it true that you're selling fish? I got fired today. Did ya? I thought he's on the spot. I thought I'd get fired. I thought I'd get fired at. Well, that's shocking. I thought I would have shot. I thought Allen physics kind of related real heavily together. I thought that made a lot of sense. Now, I was working at a pet store. I got to get up from work this morning. Eight o'clock. I got to log away up the market. I got there, and they told me they had to let me go. For what? For what? I thought we bought out another pet store. All this stuff that we're going to have business. And like I don't know, it's just all the whole DS and B.S. That's yeah, tell them to screw off Alan. So now I need it. You don't need no you need a job. Maybe you'd like to be my houseboy Alan. Add no thanks. I just I just said that they give for pocket because you're people out there in the audience. You're real nervous when I say that because how old are you Alan? What about 11? No, now I'll be 19 in July. Wow. And we've got the pocket tour if the river was one. I don't understand Alan. How can anybody who looks so good have so many problems? You know what I mean? I just don't understand. I don't know. You know, it's problems all my life. I know it. I don't want to go to show you. I guess that life kind of evens it's way out. You know, you can look like hell and just to fake your way through life with no problem. And you look can look just tremendous like you do and just be behind the eight ball your entire life. Trust out the envelope. Yeah. Just to stress that I think is a good way to put it. Yeah. Well, listen, I want to thank you for spitting on my car because that's the only place that's clean now. You know, what to be is because out your car, man. Spencer really messed up. Which much stuff my car last week. In fact, this week he's supposed to straighten it out. He messed up that Corvette. I was almost in tears. What? I just had my car clean the other day. I did really good job. Did he? Yeah, for 28 bucks. Wow. Well, we don't pay Spencer that much. Maybe we ought to start paneling. More he might actually do a job. I don't know, no, but I need a job now. So, yeah. Yeah. Well, we're here for a public service. Maybe we can land something for you. Somebody who's like a massacist who wants to put up a lot. So when you coming to visit Alan? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Whatever. Oh, sure. Anytime you want. No. As long as I'm not here. As long as I'm not here either. I have the show for myself. Yeah. Like Sunday would be a real good. Yeah. Saturday or Sunday. I think I can sit both of you. You can come down sitting on the best of Neil. It's on tape. Oh. I. You're okay. I just I was really wounded when a guy called the other day and said, you hated me with a passion. I thought, what? I thought, I have to do to. What does I mean? I don't get. How could I hate you? I mean, I really don't even get to listen to you because I work from 10 to 3. So how about those gators, huh? Yeah, gators. You know, I'm a hurricane fan anyway. Well, that's good. You know, I'm happy something worked out well in your life, Alan. Yeah, at least the gators are going somewhere. Well, listen, you didn't come by any time you like, Alan. Just give us plenty of advance notice. Yeah. That plenty of advance. How many weeks do you need it in the middle? At least a day's notice. So now we're going to call it. Obviously. I know. I know. You're going to be a good looking guy's by here. It's okay to look, Alan. That's what they always told me. Yeah, he's another guy. No. Another douchebag. OK, I'll have a great life. Yeah, you too. He'd like to. He better not come here. Well, you stop it already. Stop degrading and humiliating yourself. It's just a joke. He's not coming here. He takes it literally. Oh, he says. Yeah, that's why I said that. I handle it that you're too juvenile. I had to say it because they all take what you say literally. And they believe we're going to say it. One thing I said. Do you think on his worst day? He could be any worse than Joe's friend that was here that day? Yeah. You do? Yeah. I think you're wrong. I think that Quinello Vete was pretty, yeah. It was. And now you weren't throwing anything. It's well, that's because you've got a thing with Alan. You got, I think it's kind of like a little love. You know what I mean? It's a 10-B-4-Noon. I think there's something there that doesn't quite meet the eye. You know? Anyway. I don't know what you're trying to do. I'm looking at the world, do flies eyes. Look at that. We're looking at the world, do flies eyes. Look at that. You can just buzz off. Well, I think I'll buzz in the front door. The guy'll buzz around the back door screen. I think I'll buzz around your face. Then I'll land on the ceiling. buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz buzz It's a 10-B-3. I really appreciate turning that off. appreciate turning that off. If you know who brought that in, Todd is bringing material now, okay? Now let's have a vote. Rob's moon or flies on. Now these people that have pernises a favor, they're the July-O-D. They mong off. They ever heard this show in their entire life. You leave him alone. Now you're going to start picking on Todd? I'll sum up both. Go ahead. See what I mean? There's not exactly what I said before. Oh, Jesus. If they, if he was old and ugly, you'd probably be a big fan of Todd, okay? You'd probably want to mean you're all a time like a security, like, oh yeah, right? But you're threatened by these young good-looking guys. Like when wrong comes right. You start crawling under the table. Mitch says he's on his way by the way. Now we admit shouldn't have to come in here on a holiday. Sorry, not in the size by the time he gets here. I'll be gone. Oh, he didn't have to do that. Sure. Nobody else is here today. Oh, it's still going. Oh, that was just a tail end there. That was good. I couldn't do that again a million years. You hear that? I potted it up and just the last, well Todd is from Planned City. Doesn't that sound like his kind of humor? Absolutely. No questions. Kind of like that down home corn spun. Yeah, yeah. That's like almost nice film. You know, exactly. But he's a mean sandwich. I'll tell you that. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. Oh, my, oh my. Why? Look at the hand. Yeah, this isn't him. Is it? But I got a fan of one who hot to you. No, that's not the real p p. That's an imitator. Yeah, p p to any what? It doesn't work. It's like screw them. It's why yeah, the monitor, I got to crank up the seven. You know, it would be more important. And to just the AC. That would be out. When I don't start ordering him around like some kind of a petrol and goof ordering. I'm suggest. Or the way he said that, like some kind of who the how do you think you are? Okay. This is America's premier engineer who comes slipping in here on his day off to get some food. Oh, listen. And I know. I know a lot of the air conditioning. Yeah. And you're ordering him around like some kind of a lackey like he was spike wise or some a Mitch's only known me for about 12 years. That's that's no excuse. How long did you know? Well, what's his name from a hot 105 that came in a morning and you shine that morning. Jim, what's his name? Yeah, let's go through that. Yeah, Jim, I can never go through that episode today. It's been a while. He insulted him. He treated him like crap. He came into building, brought us all that material. He treated him like garbage. I don't know his back on him. Well, we need to go through it. Yeah. And you wouldn't have treated him any worse. How do you like, does that say in a lot? If we would our Allen. Okay. I didn't throw things at Jim. Now you got to admit Allen looks good. Okay. You've got to admit that from a distance. Yeah, like a lot like one end of a football field with the other. That's only 100 yards. Yeah, that's about right. You want to see me run fast? Now he does. He's a great looking guy, but he just got like a thing over his head, you know? Yeah, exactly. A blast born under a black thing. Yeah, Margie, hello. I might that Brian will do you? Yeah, it's a great song. Oh, good. We'll send you the CD in there. Get out here. Oh, thing on you. They're getting lower and lower. It's like they're fading out. Sometimes it's a blessing. Who did that was at the stones? Did not fade away? Was that buddy Holly? No, it's both both. You're right. And if we had a version of that, I'd play because I think that's what's happening to the colors. They're like fading away. Each color gets a little lower. And I got this thing cranked up if I cranked any louder. They'll think Rick's Glars programming the show. We got so much reverb. I 61. I tricky, tricky. Not quite. I 61. Yeah, here that. Okay, let's go to West Palm Beach, hello. Hello. Yeah, I got a leaf flower spy report. Oh, good. That's good. Okay, and the Saturdays paper. And now our eight minutes, oh, this isn't Lloyd is it? No? Or you sound like Lloyd's twin something. Oh, I never met Lloyd. I don't know. Oh, consider. Kiss the grounds, sir. Kiss the ground. Okay. There's another good one. I bet you Allen knows him too. Well, he took a poll. I think Lloyd went to sleep away, camp would stem. And the poll was which local newscasters and nationalcasters he would want to see his viewers who wanted to see nude in a playboy. Oh, okay. And Bishop. Oh, no. But for Channel 12, they pick Jackie Bang and Steve Walford. Jackie Bang. Nice for Channel 25 and his station. No, see, now he's given us all these Palm Beach people that we can see. Okay, go ahead, everybody. No, take a second. Sheila O'Connor for 25 and for Channel 10, Terry Merriman. And Channel 5 didn't come out, but however, Jennifer Velopi who is now at WOR, oh, yeah, they picked her. I heard they picked Tom Dunn too. And for national, they picked Kathleen Sullivan. Oh, are you a driver? Yeah, something sure. I'd rather I would rather meet my maker than have to look again. They're naked or dead and naked. Those are didn't make it, which I'm surprised were Connie Chung and Jane Corley. How about Jessica Savage out of Jamaica? Not too well. Well, I know Lee's audience, you know, they're pretty sick. She went to the top list. Also Linda, that would be she didn't make it at all. Yeah. How about Harley in Francis? Best, Morrison. Ed Koch? No. Okay, have a nice day, pal. We sure appreciate all that really important. Oh, there's so carried away with themselves up there. They think the whole world revolves around their little bush league town. I sure. We don't know who they are. People around here think the whole world revolves around this big bush league town. Anyway, Gail, not so bright is standing by. We're looking at only an hour and five minutes till, uh, I think it's six minutes. Till airtime on the sea or a shooting station and April. Oh, April's got the new news. Whoever's got it, go ahead and do it. Please. And W-I-O-D. Oh, Jayce. Oh, it's 12 o'clock. And W-I-D. That's what we needed was to come back a little bit early. It's a minute early. Oh, god. Oh, mine. Well, not a pot was closed because somebody, you know, that cart that we played about 20 seconds up, it was on about like a seven and a half minute cart. And I went to play. Oh, well, I think probably it's just as well that didn't fire, you know what? Yeah. Anyway, well, this is a mess to do. I was feeling better. I was feeling better for a while there. Yeah, really. Really. Relapse. Relapse. It's real, mongertial, hot, and uncomfortable. So Steve is by any chance listening. I doubt it, but if he's listening, you might want to have second thoughts. Okay. Call and sick and let him put some tapes on. How come if they can do that on Saturday? They can't do it during the week. You know, just slap some tapes on? They can do it in the meantime. They want it. Yeah. How come if they can get away with it every Saturday and put the audience in a coma? Well, that embarrassing tape repeat crap. How come they can't do it on a holidays where we can have off? Oh, and here is Mr. Arnold with all those burgers. Boy. Perfect. Time. Wow. I'm so sorry. I can't eat any of my, it had a little piece of that sandwich and I just threw that away. I just can't do it. But I'm sure that will be real. And then, of course, to top it all on Andy and Todd, they go under some stupid shooting or something. Yeah, we get shootings all at time here. And they're out there in the WOD news car. There he is, ladies and gentlemen, with a whole what is that? No, but I mean, what is that? That's more of them. Yeah. For you went nuts today. Boxes and boxes and boxes. Oh my God. Hi. Hi, you're doing great. Nice to see you. The bird and there's bad rich and that's a fan over there and the moon in the star. So in sodas? Great. I hope it will be on a sugar and ice. Robbie, a diet. Oh, nuts. I'll have the real one. God, Almighty, you guys just went nuts to the next time. Okay. Yeah, we'll put that right in the corner here. Thank you very much. Boy, that's great. Well, great. Thank you very much. That's good. Thanks a lot. Okay. There they go. Mr. Mrs. Arnold on their way back to a work in their brains out because they're open every day. Over at Arnold's Royal Castle. 120 fifth and Northwest 7th Avenue in North Miami and they brought us just tons. Now, Cheryl, are you going to come in eat or are you going to just keep or waltzing around the building and doing the Kizatsuki in a hallway? She's going to come in eat. Oh, there she is. We only had a big three times. We got enough stuff and they've got some chicken soup there too. Okay. It'll be great for you. You might learn. Yeah, so come on, April just shout out. Pick out. Go nuts. What are those? Oh, not for me. No, I can't eat anything. I'm sorry. I appreciate it. But if I touched that boy, it would be breast city. I'm telling him anytime. Nice to own business with you. And this is the last holiday I'm working. Oh, tell your, tell your fake boss in there tomorrow. Never again. That's my slogan. He wouldn't understand what that means. But take a box. Yeah, take a box. Just go nuts, guys. Because we're taking a box. Yeah, but he's trying to say, it's take a box and get out. That's what he's known. You are. You are. You're today to gale an April. That's not what I'm saying and they know it. That's exactly what he's saying. Take it and get the hell out. Yeah, go ahead. No, he's not. Certainly not just. And now, thank her. We said the Allen was unrepetable. Anytime. Okay. Well, that's true. Anytime. Probably to WOD. I may be leaving it about 22 minutes. And partly because of being sick and partly because of the Cubs game. Mostly because of being sick. I don't know. We'll see. Maybe it would be fun to kind of watch part of it in here while it's, well, the show is on. I don't think I can make it that far. There was two. It's just so close in here, isn't it? Very. It does not feel good in here at all. We don't have the fan. I mean, I was sick when I came in. And now we come in in the air is off and the building is in disarray. And this is the way it stays, man. As long as the corporate head hauncho is ironed into building, the place could be a dental care. Could be burning to the ground. Don't bother us. We're busy on holiday. You know, air feed is a holiday for these people around here. It's pathetic. What is she running? Did you see Cheryl just running down the hall? What the hell is she going to be that important? Racing down a hole. What could be that important? And we, it look at this. We got three open lines on the board too. We were off like a house on fire if you're part of that expression. And now we got three people dropped off. I can't blame them because if I were out today, if I were not here today, I'd find something better than this. No kidding. Wouldn't you? Then rehashing all the games, some must be, there must be something more important. No. Well. What a look. I guess I'm wrong. For you to attack Allen. Okay. That was bad enough. Then you started attacking April and Gale for no reason. It all like take the box and get the hell out of here. It's not what I said. Now you're attacking the cubs. No. Yes. Trust me. Set on the facts or this just a note. It says Todd says when he comes back, there had better be some burgers left for him. He's gone to a murder. Well, I got news for you. Todd, the next murder you go to may be your own. Okay. With another note like that, that's as early as your note or whatever you said before to Mitch. I didn't say anything certainly to him. It was it's earlier or not. It was said in a very disrespected, we'll certainly tell him about I'd start working on the AC first. No. We're about to levels on a sticking goddamn ceiling. Well, I think I was right. Yeah. Yeah. No, I'm serious. They got to get their act together here. They got to get their stuff together. This building is just impossible. I mean, we had some warm days of Zeta, but this is like solteries, the word I'm looking for. It's only 95 degrees in the shade out there. It's like, well, you know how you always went to it. Plus, I'm sick to begin where you always went to the show outside. Yeah, probably is a lot cooler outside. I don't doubt that. Oh, this is appropriate. It's the Boka Puker. Hello. In the air. Yeah. Hey, I just want to wish you and the bird. I have the memorial then. It's Captain Breath. Yeah. I just hope you get to feel in a little better before us. Can I? Can I answer one of those sodas that they brought me before you drink all of them rich? Uh, yeah. Or is that your ice? What's inside? This is getting a little pee warm here if you're part of that expression. What's that, sir? I just hope you get to feel in a little better. All right. As soon as I get out of this building, man, I think I'll be out sick for about a week. That's the only way you can do it here. They won't give you any time off voluntarily. So you have to get sick. Listen, you and the bird have a good one. What I'm going to do is I'm going to put the diet seven up over the ice. There you go. Thank you, Mr. and Mrs. Arnold. You're just terrific. They are. See now. Oh, and nuts. They brought boxes and boxes of these little burgers and they brought chicken soup and sodas and ice. God was that nice. Well, yeah. I got to go outside and turn my ribs over. So you guys take it easy. All right. Okay. Get that finger ready to go down your throat now. No, not today. I got to keep it all down today. It's good food. Okay. See you. All right. Bye. I'm disappointed. Twelve minutes past. I get on it right away, Mitch. If I were you. Okay. What is this? Just can't believe you. You're so surly and crass and hostile. You talking to me? Yeah. Well, in hospital, my God. What is the verdict? Is that I think if he uses words that we can actually say? Well, it's not as dirty as it's not as bad. It's not as bad as everybody else. Sir, normally is. I see. But, you know, I think it's worth listening to. I think Neil will have a good time with it. Okay. Now you guys aren't working today, are you? Well, I'm here in the office. There's not there's no traffic is there. No. Very limited service today. Yeah. I'm going to have an easy time on the way home. I hope. Well, you know, don't go to any of the parks from the United States. Oh, no, no, no. You're going to get some delays going to the park. Oh, I see. No, I'll stay away from them. But you should have a pretty fair day today. Okay. Everybody's at home. Yeah. They have any brains. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. Yeah. We'll see what it sounds like. Okay. Sure. I'll tell you what. I'll take it for you. I'll make the dub of it. And I'll see if I can get it to your studio sometime this week. All right. Okay. See you. Okay. All right. Well, they are traffic patrol who has obviously very, very little to do today. God. All right. Hollywood. Hi. Hi. I was wondering. Did you have the capacity and the end of the end of the 500? I did see the why I saw the, you know, the highlights on the news. Right. And I must say they had some great crashes this year, didn't they? Well, no crashes great. You know, hell. No, but I mean, you know, incredible. The one where they had the camera right in the middle, right, where knocked the camera out, that was unbelievable. Leave a lot of being, you know, I was being facetious, of course. But every, but he walked away. It was this unbelievable crash with car parts flying everywhere. The piece of the car that was left was the engine. Yeah. And he just hopped out like nothing. You know, you can see technology is that they have. It's just amazing. It sure is because that looked, you know, that looked like the words. That's what, that's why I can say the crashes were great because nobody was heard apparently. Well, one of them really frost my ass a little bit. I'd like to call every some fit of Paul the adush bag because he fath thou, I'm surjunior there right at the end. Yeah, I saw that. I think I'll lose the race. But I answered it in protest or anything. Well, I'd like to protest. Would you? Would you think he would have if he had felt he had been wrong? Well, I would think so. And he didn't. Well, I really wanted to see how junior. I see. Okay, but it was, it was a really spectacular race. The highlights I saw were really good. I must say. It was truly one of the best races ever. Yeah, like 100. Yeah, not going to understand why so many people go up there. Really a spectacular. Well, it is really a happening. It really is, yeah. Oh, absolutely. Just like Daytona, you know. Uh-huh. In fact, the Coca-Cola 600 was pretty high yesterday. Also, okay. That came down to within just like, let's second the two of the finish. Uh-huh. You're fading away. Well, I'm really kind of disappointed that Dale wasn't feeling well when he left. Well, he really is bad. We're hot Memorial Day. Yeah. We're going to do the lightning round. You are. Can I hold please? I have something I have to queue up for you. Really? I absolutely. So he put him on hold. I mean, it's only, all right. Well, it's only, uh, he's on five. We'll put five on also. We will see how many lines we can get on. How long the field does. I don't know if we will or not. But, uh, all right. Let's go to Miami. Hi. Hey there, Murray. Okay. All right. We're supposed to say you're going to have a lightning rail? Yeah. I think we're going to do it anyway. All right. Can you put me on hold too much? Oh, no. I think you're going to get a bunch of calls now. No, I was just kidding. Now, call you. I have any problem. No, all right. Okay. You got it. Okay. You call back. Thank. So yeah, we're going to kneel. Didn't have the energy. I think I can do it. We'll do a special, memorial day line. You're I mean, could I possibly go a day without hearing the door lady? I mean, you know, come on. Let's get serious. Okay. He's gone. Uh, now listen. What do you want? Hello? He's gone. Oh, hello. What do you want? Yeah, I just wanted to say I only heard a first of that robbed moon song, but it sure sounded better than that F.C.C thing you played. Now listen, that F.C.C.C thing is a classic. A classic. Yeah. Well, it's so bad. It's good. Have you ever heard it before? No, no. Now, see you got to hear it a couple times. Oh, it's a portrait. Me some more. Yeah. It's a spoof. It's a while I figured that. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Well, okay. I'll let you get away with it. All right. All right. Thanks a lot. Boy, it must be a holiday. They're going really, he's see on me. We have time for one more. There's nobody on this line, is there? Yeah. They're gone. Boy, the lines are clearing out. We're going to have a one to two hour today. This is going to be good. Uncle Neil left early. The AC is fouled up here and it's a holiday and the cubs are on and he had to get out of here. Rich, we don't have to watch the cubs. Now, we have to listen all at a haze or I. Boy, we had a good day after all. Now, somebody's in the newsroom, it's either Gale or April or somebody will bring you the one of clock news and we're going to come back and we're going to have, I'll know I'm in it early. I'm sorry Nick. Oh, boy. Palm Beach. They're not there. These lines are clearing out just because Neil left, you know. I mean, come on. We're going to do a one to two hour. Yeah, we're going to do a one to two hour. And Neil's driving home. You know, we have to do something. He keeps that in my kids. Neil's listening. He's monitoring. Okay. He's driving home and takes him like 40 minutes to get home. So he's going to hear like the first half hour, one to one, 30. He will hear it. Trust me. So you can't slack off. And he can't bail out. You know, he think Neil's gone, you know, the teachers away, you know, what's the cats away? The mice will play. No, no, no, no. Come on now. Let's get our brains working. I'm going to go listening. He's monitoring. He's listening to every word. He's not listening to Sandy. I get serious. Now think about it. So you people, you know, all right, I'm going to give you a couple minutes. We'll go to the newsroom, get the one to clock news. Give you a couple minutes to get it together. Take a deep breath. And then we'll be back and we will have the one to two hour. Good day. 524 WIOD and Broward. Or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neil Rogers on news talk radio, 610 WIOD. We're having minute, minute, minute, minute, minute. Neil got mad when he welcomed the moon. And call you do your bag without a moon. And, and, and, and, never, never, never, never. Your hard bed for the country ahead when the bird read the news, you wish you was dead. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Neil left, kids. Fail that out of here. Left. I really can't blame him. The AC is fouled up, it's a holiday. Cubs are on, you know. And, uh, I got to get rich when it gets back in there to get the, uh, damn cubs off our TV. Oh, by the way, before we go to the phone, then every line is lit. I know that's weird. So, we'll go see what they want. But first, I got something for you here. Oh, my dear, boh, down the heat you hear. Please, oh, my baby, oh, my baby, oh, my baby. One of which happens to be Lee, we're sure what, every morning. From 6 until 9 a.m. That's just probably actually, you know, even telling you quite a bit about this cat in this personal life. So, for this morning's got a big call when it happens to be that he gets up every morning to be here at 6 o'clock. Yeah, that's not too bad, you know. But, uh, he stays around here all day and mess around, making little things here, little of this little, and it sort of gets to everyone's. Well, you know, I mean, you can't, you know, you know, put so much of yourself into your work. You should have a little time for play and rest of relaxation and stuff like that, you know. You know, what is wine? It's stuff like that. Think about it in the morning. You didn't listen to please radio. These are the angels. That Ricky Tickie. He's a piece of work, a name. Yeah, piece of something. Okay, Palm Beach, hello. Hey, bird. Are you there? I'm here. Hi. Hey, first related birthday wish. Oh, thanks. Hey, listen, I'm the one that sent you as a TV case pictures of the ones that go. Oh, which ones? The ones with, uh, um, um, paradise and, oh, oh, thank. Once from the, the high-sided, whatever. Well, the new pick. Yeah, the new pick. You put those in your shrine or not? Oh, yeah. Oh, no question. Yeah. Unbelievable. How do you know if you see them before or why? I mean, they were kind of old, but yeah. I think I may have it, didn't matter. You know what I mean? I thought that eight by ten, I'm for that was more than you might do. Oh, boy. Yeah. That's TV. Okay, I just want to say and, um, great job. Nice to hear from you. Thanks for the picture. Okay, but okay. By the way, I want to thank, um, Hank Goldberg, the shirt he gave me from my birthday. He gave me a, uh, WIOD Miami Hurricanes shirt. Very nice. Really, that's a word over the weekend. Really nice shirt and Hank, thanks a million for that. No, he's listening because he is, of course, a newly, newly, not here and can you blame him? Anybody with any brains is not here, I think. Uh, Miami, hello. Hey, first. Yeah. You know, Neil always calls everybody to get a life. Uh-oh. Well, anyone that would go home on the Memorial Day to watch the Codes play should get a life. What do you think? I think I couldn't have put it better myself. I'm not saying, uh, I'm about extending out lightning round to a half hour today. No, no, no, but we will do, we weren't even going to do it at all. Well, at least we're 10 minutes or so. Well, we'll see. We'll do it. We'll do it. We'll do it a good long one now. I want more thing, Bert. Yeah. I just want to talk Kenny L and Hugo that's a moreronic douche bag. All right. Take it easy. Boys, that guy. You think I'm surly. Oh, what about that guy? My, I mean, hello. Hey, Bert, how's it going? All right. Hey, this thing is tight somewhere. We need to Sally fish in the supermarket. No, she had in her shopping cart. There's boxes and boxes and a sugar shocker. So we, uh, wow. Yeah. Uh-huh. Yeah, some calls for Uncle Neil today. Let's take our life in our hands now. Thank you to Boca. Hello. Hi, Glenn. Hi. Hi. How are you calling you about, yeah, in the new segment you're running a thing about the two guards and the old guards. The guys are walking the two. Yeah. Why used to be one of them? Uh-huh. But you know, what are the prerequisites or prerequisites for getting there? They didn't care what you did and be at the home or anything. This was long you never had sex with another man. Is that right? I'm serious. This was what they were really interested in. Yeah. One of their main worries was that you had never had sex with another man. Oh, my God. Why do you see they know what's important? It was sickening. They get in this big room and, you know, trying to intimidate you and scare you to death. Hmm. And that's the only thing they talked about. What, what city did you do it in? Was an Arlington. Up in Arlington. Yeah. What's that movie? Gardens of Stone. Gardens of Stone. That's quite a movie. I saw it. Yeah. What'd you think? It's part of it are pretty representative. It doesn't fairly decent job, but, you know, it doesn't tell a whole story. I understand, but it's pretty good movie. Yeah. Yeah. I would recommend it actually. I was thinking of buying a copy. I rented it. I thought about buying a copy, but I don't know. Yeah. Well, that showed some of the screwed up inside, you know, priorities. That's what I mean. You know, it's better, you know, how screwed up you were, whether you were, you know, Wacked down on drugs or anything. This as long as, you know, you were on the surface. You could look good and they were real home of folks. Is that right? Yeah. Well, I'll be damned. Why, I like you telling that story today. Well, I don't know why, but I, you know, Memorial Day, they used to make us go out and do all kinds of strange things for the people. And, uh, I just thought I'd call you and offer that. Why did you do it? That was good day. Okay. See ya. That was Boca. Yeah. Okay. My amy. Hi, Glenn. Hi. You guys have really didn't make me laugh a lot lately. We have a rehabbing. Oh, you have. I was wondering if I could make you all laugh a lot today too. Well, we'll see. I guess, uh, I guess we'll judge it. I've got about 10 seconds worth of material that I could queue up. And you want to blow it here all at once? Um, maybe about 11 or 12 seconds. Okay. Okay. Here comes. They know, no matter how long they don't walk, you sidewalk 60. You know, people are assholes. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. I've been following Steve K. Can't get it up. We'll thank you. Yeah. This is the way you get the game. What up? Did up to? Uh, Little preview there. Sort of, sort of like, uh, the lightning round. Just sort of a, uh, like, lightning round headroom. Kind of a little sample montage that we are going to do today. Neil wasn't going to do it. You didn't have the energy and understand, but I will do the lightning round. We'll go into that in just about a half hour. See, say I have something to look forward to. Let's go to, uh, sunrise next. Hey, Glenn, how you doing? Okay. How you doing? Pretty good. Is it okay for some of Chronicles to call today? Yeah. And Neil's gone. Yeah. This is very junior. Howly, Toledo? How you doing? Neil just drove off of I95, sir. You're going to be wrecked about this. You're going to go into that semi-attractor. Hey, exactly. Right. You just drove right off the road. Right into the, yeah. What are you doing today? I'm doing good. Yeah. I figured Dad's out of town. I'd give you a call. Is he? You can throw a good today. Oh, so you're sort of, Don't forget what? Don't forget what? That must have been grandma. Ha ha ha. Maybe grandma likes to get on the, on the lightning round. Excellent idea. Do you think? Yeah. Well, I have to agree with you with CVK. She is gorgeous. Didn't she? Yeah. I'm waiting for some new material to come out with her. There is some coming out. There's a movie called Shag. Yeah. I don't know if it'll be out this summer or this fall, but it'll be out. There's more coming. Yeah. I think it was a summer, late summer. It's looking good. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. This is called the thing I basically. Oh, good. Uh, can we hold the lightning round maybe grandma like to get on? Well, in your case, yeah. Okay. Okay. So now we have, we have two on hold. Okay. We'll put, uh, Barry, junior on hold. We have two lines now out of eight on hold. For you, keeping score at home. Okay. I'll say it again. Just we have two lines Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. On hold. And uh. What's this? Just don't you buy your steak and so much and two hours. Oh, this is a happy guy. That's so happy, but I'm pretty confused. I say that. Hello there. Happy, that's wonderful. God, the youth to you, A.M. The way we move. You know, Piddain, things for the hurry. I think he did the theme of the soundtrack, tomato flag. 14 years faster, a lot of the clock. Come on, Piddain. Oh, my God. No, it's all without Piddney. Piddney. Oh, no. One, 17. 16. W-I-O-D. Depend on it. Okay, for Lauderdale. Hey, bird, happy Memorial Day. How you doing today? Good. How you doing? Good day. Good. Good. How you doing? You have a good day. I don't know. Listen, you guys are good. When passed today, I had a party yesterday and a little bit too much. So I got a relaxing dig. I got a surefire way for Neil to avoid having to work on holidays. I called you the last time Neil was sick. Remember he was sick for about four days in a row. At least. A couple, yeah. Well, he was like really sick for a bed. He was out for like three or four days in the back of the day. He wasn't feeling well. I called you and I relayed a story to you about when I was working on a beach and waterdale. I said something about Canadians, friends, Canadians. I got let go. Yeah. And then I sent you a bit of information about me. I was just tracking everything. You said, the send me information. Oh, sure. Sure. And you were keeping in mind from Neil goes on vacation. I don't believe in radio people working on holidays myself. But me, I do it for the fun of it. So when Neil needs somebody, no, I ain't trying to bump him or you are. But I mean, hey, the guy doesn't feel good. And you know, people are the only people down here in the market that are really worth while you and I would get along great because I love baseball, but I'm not a cub span. Wow. I'm one of the few, I mean, I watched the cubs. I'll watch any team. I root for Texas. Now, do you have a job yet? Oh, yeah. Not in Ray. I've been DJing on an off various parties. Not a few night clubs, but I work a regular day job. I see. But the thing is, how many Texas fans are down here? Probably very, very few. I never ever hear anything about it. Well, there's a guy to play for Texas. That's from the Miami area. Palmaaro used to be with the cubs. So there probably are a few Texas fans down here, but not enough to make you upset. Now, I thought when Neil left, we were going to stop talking about baseball. Well, no, I'm just, you know, letting you know that such a person exists. That would come in, have a great time. I don't use the word douchebag. I've got another word that I use. That I don't think I better say right now, but it would go over pretty well. It'd be a new word for vocabulary of being able to speak people down here. I have one question for you, you can play something. Yeah. You had, from, I guess it was GTR about two weeks ago, a collection of new novelty things. And there was something about a grateful dead, something about a Jerry Garcia. Yeah, yeah. Now, that's on the comedy rock network with Ron C.D. And he didn't leave those for me. Oh, well. And then we don't have any Q-sheets anywhere. I couldn't find it in any way. Ah, that's all right. So I have to pass it on to Neil. You still got the thing that I set you correctly. Yeah. We'll look at it. If the situation occurs, that you need a guest for an afternoon or whatever. Let me know because I'm well trained. I go party on the paper. You know, so I mean, Neil is not to worry about me messing the studio. And I can't wait. I can hardly wait for Steve Caine's show. I mean, that's going to be more about as exciting as having my Keith Paul. Okay. I'm not sure. I'm going to be honest with you. I'm not sure exactly what I'm going to do when he goes on vacation, which is the first two weeks in July, by the way. That's no problem. Like four weeks away. That is no. I'll let you know. Yeah, I lived. I'm going back to Connecticut for a weekend for a wedding, but aside from that, okay. Okay. No problem as my nine-year-old cousin would say. I'll let you know. Hey, well, thank you very much for the show. You're doing a great job. See ya. Take care. Bye-bye. Somebody trying to do a warm-away into the show. Yeah, we have enough problems with that trust me. Miami. Yeah, this is in burden. I'm going to sing in my rhythm, my ain't out. My defense is feeling under the weather. Oh, thank you. I'm going to come a fill in. This is the second time he's tried that with me. It's really his resume. I remember. I remember. I'm going to be honest with you. I think now Neal's going to go out a way for two weeks. Okay, first two weeks of July. This is for all the Nealies to, you know, like get your mindset because Uncle Neal's going to be gone for two weeks. Okay. And I think I think I'm just going to sit in here with the collars and do the show. You know what I mean? You've done it before, and it sounds great. Yeah, we, you know, Johnny Dark may come by one day and we may do some little things like that. I don't think we're going to do anything real major. That's what's in my mind that we're just going, oh my God, Spike Wise is in the building ladies and gentlemen. Holy, literally. See, coming in here, he's got his kid. Spike, wait, sir. Just hold on. Okay. I got Neal's long court. I'm going to walk around out to the door and see if I can get Spike Wise to come in here with this kid. I'm over at the door. Spike. Hey, Spike. Alright, he's checking anyone coming. Yeah, if you can find him, Rich, haven't come in here for a minute. He wants to talk about GTR, but we want to say hi to Spike. Spike's here on a holiday, sir. That is amazing. It's, it's, that's why, you know, I made such a big semis about it. We have a bureaucrat. The operations director of the radio station, he's here on a holiday. That is to be commanded. No, kidding. So I wanted to bring him in and commend him. You know what I mean? Yeah. And if I had Rich, I will see if we can get him in here for a second. Anyway, what were we talking about? I forgot. Okay. By the way, what is the status with the, with that movie that Neal wouldn't see and the captain Dave kept pushing on him? He never saw that was Blade Runner. Blade Runner, have you ever seen that? Yeah, I've seen that. I saw when it was in theaters, you know, years ago. I was at about 85. I watched it again about a month or two ago. That's very shaky. Have you ever seen it? It doesn't transfer well to the TV screen because the white lights, yeah. They're sitting on the laser disk where they're there. They're there boxed it and put it in. It's around sound. No, you're that heard, but you're right about that. I did see it in the theater back when it was new. I remember liking it better back then. I don't know. Yeah, it's a very visual movie. If you don't really get the full impact of the theater with the sound effect on the white screen. Yeah, you're right. Rachel Ward was also very diluted in that film. Yes. Yeah, they gave her that 40s look that was really incredible. Was it Sean Young and that? Sean Young, that's not right. Yeah, not right. She did look great. I think that's her first movie or something. Yeah. Okay, was stunning in that movie. I never record nicer than I could have played. Did you saw her as the next movie? Yeah, you're right. That's one of the main reasons I looked at it was to look at Sean Young. Yeah. And she looks good, but she's nuts. Let me tell you. Yeah, well, also. He finds Spike Wise. He disappeared, man. He disappeared on you. He disappeared on you. Ha ha ha ha. Man. When to speak to him for a minute. OK, OK, Spike. 97 GTR, OK. All right. We have to do that for Spiker. By the way, bird, I happy to be late at 29th. Ha ha ha ha. Thanks. OK, well listen, I'll talk to you next time. OK, but take care. Bye. All right. There he goes. Now, it's just possibly a call from homestead on the line. Every line is full. I had a bird in half and half to the but you know my friend called me. Hey, how you doing? I'm him. I'm doing great. I want to talk about that. It's got about much chance to get on that station. There's a Neil. There's a mayor in a woman. Yeah. Ha ha ha. Well, you, you have a way of making a phrase there. I've got I've got this feeling eight ever going to happen. Yeah. But what I'm doing right now, I'm doing some almost wriggle. I'm, uh, I'm still on concert tickets. Ha ha. You're what? I got concert tickets for the here. I got a first for a standard. I thought you said you had guns or tickets. Well, now, I got a lot of stuff. You got that right. He won't let me talk to him anymore. No, you're gone as soon as he hears who it is. You're gone. I was hoping he's gone be there because I was going to try to write me around today. But what he doesn't do. He's going to do it and you will get through. Thanks, Burger King. Okay, ha. There he is. A very, very brief appearance. But compared to Uncle Neil, that was incredibly long and pondress. I, you know, pondress out of the word, right? Uncle Neil, I can't believe he's listening to this while driving down 95. You can't find Bill Wieson. Now, he disappeared out of here like a bad out of hell. Now, first of all, we want to, you know, commend him. The only bureaucrat at WIOD in the building. But that's the can. Yeah. Now, he should be up here for the fluffy ears. You would go upstairs. Hey, look, he doesn't look like that. Oh, my God. He's on the top of him. Our stay a while ago, but it was busy all day. Weird. Yeah, every line show. I don't understand, every line's full. Hey, I just thought Robin Williams is in the park. Good. You're just kids. How's the weather up there? Today is gorgeous. Yeah. It's like 66. Like 66 to be the way B.C. Yeah. Yeah, I couldn't find what's his name on the hour. Yeah. He's on K Rock. Yeah, but nobody thinks it's a no. It's low on the dial. Yeah. Say that. It's at 92. It's not like 92. Yeah, I'm just sitting around. Yeah, you can find him. Wait down low on the FM dial. Uh-huh. Well, we're heading out to back to Miami in about three hours. Oh, well, then forget it. Yeah. Oh, well. I couldn't resist getting through to my man. Yeah. Well, he, uh, he's not. You remember, man. You're all buddy Jimmy Junior. Jimmy Junior. That's right, man. He said me here in 1981. Of course. Was that when it was 81? He was 81. Jimmy Cagney. That's right. Boy, those were the days. Yeah, you're not kidding. I sure remember you. What are you doing these days? Well, I'm still trying to get that big break. You know, acting wherever I can. I see. You know, getting a little work here and there. You know, they're doing something else at that theater now. They have it open again. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I know. What on movies and uh. All right. Yeah, they're supposed to have a big film festival. Yeah, that's right. So we wish you all the best. Yeah, for sure. Well, Graham, Ben, you gave us a call. Well, right away, I got to tell you. I saw the most gorgeous oriental woman with the nicest set of bright. I mean, unbelievable. This was right up here. How are you? He thought about me. Absolutely. Right. But when we got into the game, we had to go stirring cab by last night. We had to go in 100 miles. Down to a fabulous. Yeah. We're talking major, major bouncing. I think I've had some cab cab rides in New York City, Jimmy. I'm serious that I will remember till the day I die. Yeah. I'm serious. I'll never forget him. I mean, almost as good as a roller coaster. Yeah. Very similar. And there he goes. This guy's name had like seven concerts. Oh, yes. They all do. Is that funny? Total trip. I don't know. I mean, is much as everybody's so in love with New York. I'd rather be in Miami any day. Yeah. I'm just going to take the heat and humidity. Exactly. And we got to hear today. Yeah. I'm sure. Well, we'll be sweating there. Yeah. Well, sorry, Miss Niel. Yeah. Me too. But hey, look. I got to talk to my main guy. All right. See you later, bud. I talked to you later. Okay. Call from New York. Unbelievable. Well, it's almost 130. So we're going to take a break here in the lighting realm. Oh, beyond today, differing from what was previously an al-privious host. Now, I'm going to do it. We'll do it in about 15 minutes. Okay. We'll be right back. There's a 301 and we go to point, okay. Now, first off, I want to, for all those with your scorecards at home, okay. Line 5 and line 8 are on hold for the lightning round. Okay. Got that? Line 5? It's like bingo. You know, and line 8 are on hold for the lightning round. Okay. Point and beach. Hello? Hello, birds. You're a douchebag. Ha ha ha. Also, a very, very long appearance with Niel's on here. Miami. Hey, Glenn, what's going on? Okay. Hey, listen. I'm sure Niel's not listening anymore. Do you have a copy of the golf game for any goes-way on vacation? Okay. Now, this is a big secret, sir. Well, he's not least home by now. Okay. Yeah, you're right. Nobody's listening anyway. Um, yeah. He doesn't know that. I know it's deep down that I do. I have got it. I don't have it in my hands yet. But I, it's hidden. It's, I'm not going to tell you what city it is in. It's in a city in South Florida. And I'm going to get it before he goes on vacation. I mean, you know, for when he goes on vacation, which would be like in about four weeks. Great. So, play it the first day. Great. You know when he's good Thai restaurants in North Dade? The best one is Thai House 2, 163rd Street. You've ever been there? No. It's almost a federal highway on 163rd Street. On the right-hand side if you're going, you know, east. It's called Thai House 2. That is absolutely without question. The best Thai food in North Dade. Okay. Okay. Okay. See you. Okay. And now we go to Hollywood. Hello. I'm sorry to bring up the subject of baseball again, but I think there's an expression that Mitchell probably agree with me that Niels forgot. Uh-huh. And that's that it's early. Early in the season if the cops are on top. I think even I've heard that expression. Yeah. Given enough time the cops and that is to hang themselves throughout East India. Uh-huh. And I think the Metra pull it back out on a big Metra fan. Okay. Okay. So we got a bullet. And here he comes. Here he comes. Here he comes. He's got his kid. Here he comes. Ladies and gentlemen. Bill wise. He's coming down the hallway. Bill. Come on in here. Come on in here, pal. Now first off we want to commend you. Mr. Wai. Hey. Hey. Then Bill's uh, want to build sons.

He's like boom. No. He's like his dad. He's shy. Now Bill, um, I know some stories about you. Uh huh. Uh huh. There's no fighting knows. Would you like me to tell a couple? Uh huh. It's a holiday. It's a holiday. I'm looking for a car because I want Benjamin. I want to know what did I? I've met fixing this. Yeah. Yeah. The AC people are in the way. I've heard you complain about him. Yeah. They get the bad water pumpers. I don't know. It should be done by sports stock. Now this is what we want you to do. Now listen. Benjamin. Benjamin. Are you listening to me? Now listen to this. It's so water to two hours. See, that's the kind of stuff we want you to do. I don't know what you're doing this part of town. Is that I come in and see what Rich had ordered for lunch? Would you like a burger? That could sandwich us up from Captain Jimmy's and he had burgers from Arnold's. Yeah, did you like a little hamburger? No, you're not talking to us? No. Okay. You're going to be on the lightning around. That's coming up in about ten minutes. Yeah. You know, I say 97 GTR. We get the best calls starting Friday bill on the hotline for the lightning round for some reason. Yeah. The best calls seem to come in on the hotline. Okay. That's a good thing. You're a business.

Anyway, yesterday you probably didn't watch the Lakers game. Me? I don't know why would you think I didn't watch the Lakers game. Well, I have a feeling you might have been out doing things. But the highlight of the game for me was when they made a special announcement that Brent Bingbanger was 50 years old in the entire crowd boot him when they brought the cake out. Even I like that. Well, that was quite humiliating. Yeah, even I like that. Okay. All right, sir. Doing a good job, Brad. Thank you, sir. Take care. All right. Unbelievable. Okay. Now, let's go.
