Remember the hero did the hatchet job on casino gambling seven years ago and they had to picture the drifter out in behind the in the desert. You must have been the guy. A nice Jewish boy like me. Yeah. That's right. No way. Remember what the song by the drifters up on the roof? I think that's where Johnny's going to be after lunch today. Well you're up early. There's only 9 30 out there. Right. Of course it's Vegas is timeless. There are no clocks on the walls or nothing to win. Come for your brain like that. And I'm sure you're getting lots of oxygen in your hotel room even though you're staying at a friend's house. I just got in a couple hours ago. Yeah. Well take a little nap for an hour and then go right back down and punch your gut. So that's the way to do it in Vegas. Right? You got it. Okay. Tell him you know what? The sign Larry King's name. They'll give you a big line of credit at the table. No problem. You'll be Larry King once night on a roll though? No. You was a butt kiss and you know what? Yeah isn't he always though? And when her roll though cast that check for a boy he had as a grid on his face ear to ear. Okay Johnny, knock up that off again as long as you got a quarter left man you still got a shot.

Oh. Oh. I like to wear you well. It was in a area thing. I like to wear you so. Let me walk you. I was nobody in the audience who remembers this. I like it because that was a big fast domino. I want to go back. That's it. You're my trusted. No way. You're free. You heard what I said. In fact I remember I was sick one time I had a cold and I was home from a school and I'm walking by a fat stominal came out on Imperial records and I knew it was coming in a record store that day on a Wednesday. Because the Miller record store in Canon Day with New York, the new records used to come in every Wednesday. And I made my mother go down to the record store and buy it. So I'd be like the first kid in Canon Day would have I'm walking by fat stominal. I don't know why that was important. But I wanted it interesting. And I had one of those little 45 RPM with just a spindle. You know, well, there's a little, um, that they had stack them on and then everything every third record would stick you know and it wouldn't drop down. And it was great. Very simple. You know, there's no like multi-thousand dollar stereo systems back then. I was just a little record player. That's all you need it. Right? Um, and once in a while you'd get an EP and extended play and it would have four cuts on it to one inside and you'd be in heaven. Yeah. Great. What did you think just talking about that period of when Pat Boone used to record? I liked that one. I hate to admit that. I'm embarrassed that he would record like that. He would record like that. Yeah. I didn't like that. Yeah. And also a little Richard. He did really fruity, which for Pat Boone I thought was very a part of. And the difference was just incredible. I loved Pat Boone. I didn't like Pat Boone. I loved it. Oh, I was obsessed. It's 1242. Well, it's one of those things I must confess. I mean, he looked good. And I tell you, I mean, I didn't realize he was going to become a religious fanatic. Who did all these phony spots. Cool springs. Hello. Hello. I took a fence to the, uh, you took a fence to something on the floor. That ripped the bird. Oh. I have two birds on my own. Do you? Most of us have only one sir. Yes. Well, he showed a signature. You know? Absolutely. Well, you know, I figured based on his accent. He's either a heavy criminal operator, a septic tank cleaner, or a has been country singer. Exactly. I don't know. Yeah. What the accent don't under any way. Yeah. What the heck was he doing on a radio? And if he wants to get his own show, listen, we'll be glad to plug it for you. Yeah. I'm glad you didn't put me throughout the lead, because I don't have my own show. And I didn't want to come in after him. And that said, I just want to give the bird my two senses as far as being pro bird. Mm-hmm. Yeah, you sound like you're pro bird. And you've got the best of the six. You have the best of her, her minimic beans. Yeah. Yeah. That's not one of those little single CDs. You know, that's only got like a couple of minutes on it. That's about it. Actually, it was the worst of her minimic beans. No, no, no, that's what they call it. They did both. Yeah. I see. Same difference. They got no show, believe me. I mean, they're not bad guys. Well, they're okay. They're like just here in their like phantoms. We're at indication together. We aren't fan-ther. Have a nice day. Okay. Bye. Go 44 in Wild and we have an open line in Broward now. We got one in Boca. We had a little hiccup there on the phone. Little grips on the phone. What happened to that grips card? Because it's because we got lunch coming any minute. We have a grips card. Yeah. This isn't a great for the lunch hour every day. Well, we got a card for everything around here. You know what? That boy Gary. This is the only station in America that's got a card for virtually anything that you can think of. What does that mean? Anything. Nice setup. Yeah. Important. Oh. Well, it kind of loses something in the branch station. And somebody keeps stopping these cards in the middle. I have a feeling I may have done it on that one. There's the one with the loop. The loop one. Those are the ones that keep disappearing. I think Roger's got him in the other room. I don't know what he does with this stuff. Like the days of the week. Remember we used to get that. We don't get that anymore. That's a ring here. It's really loose. Good morning. It's Tuesday and Wednesday. We're not allowed to play that stuff anymore. I like them. Call Springs, hello. Hello? Yes. I've been listening to you guys since you moved to the WIOD. I don't understand when you get that stupid bird jerk guy on the show. Huh. Yeah, he just doesn't seem to contribute anything. Yeah. Does he bother you, sir? Yeah, he does. I don't need the day he does the show by himself. I don't even listen to the show. Really? Yeah. Well, then you would really be a perfect person to talk about it then. Since you don't even listen. Priority to you when you're with him. You know what? That's one I have to.

I'm not that other station. Yeah. Well, it's going to play like sort of obscure music also. Well, what's new about that? They've zed has been playing obscure music for two years. I feel like to say how long is it going to take these douche bags and realize that they're playing that now? Yeah. And they don't got anything. Well, don't expect them to do anything that makes sense. It's just going to be cheap. You know, they like that sound like stuff. It's kind of like Rush Bing Bang and all a crap that we carry at night in on the weekend on this season. It's cheap. But just idiots. I don't want to stand it. I mean, you know, I've rejaded two since you know, back in Wednesday. And I mean, I am I am a nearly I'm a chronic one for a while. But they're idiots. I mean, they're just total idiots.

And, uh, I wonder. Ooh, and more feta chini. I have a little bit of that, Andy. Yes, sir. Go ahead. Okay. I mean, you're just on the year to kill a little time. You do realize that. Don't you? Yeah. I live until every day. And, uh, I'm, uh, first-hand collar. Listen to you. Wait. I live until you, from the data, uh, Ellen Burke got up, uh, air with those, uh, uh, Brad off. And, uh, I wanted to tell the birds, uh, happy birthday, because I'm, uh, uh, same age as he is. So, uh, everyone? My birthday makes ten. Uh-huh. And we'll put more horses. Yeah. So, uh, so, uh. So, in other words, you haven't listened for just one week, and uh, you hate me. Oh, gosh, you know, I like to-I like tocap it, uh, like to my girlfriend. And, you know, I ever turned you guys right here, Oh, uh-huh, uh, uh, uh, I said, yeah. And, that's him. That's good. And, uh, what does she do again? How did she go? She goes a-ha, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh-huh. And then you put it away, right? I understand sir, I mean I can relate to it. I grabbed my cut on a bias. He threw away more than he left. I'll be looking at some human do steaks and you guys are doing great. The sun is shining here for days. There you go. You guys have a fantastic week. If all I got to say thanks a lot. Thank you. What a guy. You've been a clue,ston. Wow, what is that? Oh, I'm going up there. 1258. Hmm, boy, is this great? I look at Jürgen. He's just having a frenzy. Oh, that's for April. Okay. That's a good story. Just going nuts. Two bad that Ross isn't here to enjoy all of this, but we understand what's going on. We, you know, we can relate to the games that are being played. Now can't we? Send all these, get all the certain interns out on assignment. Of course, that just leaves a lot more food for the rest of us, right? But we don't really care because you can only look so long. You know what I mean? And that gets kind of ponders. Johnny Dolan says he has the Ron Delrecco. He will bring it into Maro. He says he's stolen any record you need. Uh-huh. It's true. Yeah, between him and Johnny dark. And you will imagine. Dark's going to bring it in, Johnny. Well, just as a backup. Yeah, if you want a back. Johnny copy is scratchy as hell, okay? Oh, Dolan's working. Oh, yeah, the morning's on. Yeah. Is he? Are they right vacation? He runs the board there. Oh, look at that. He mungged all over his crotch there. That's disgusting. Okay. They're going to be talking about that in the newsroom for hours now. Anyway, speaking of that, April. Neil Rogers. To get a touch and toss. Call 751 WIOD in May. 524 WIOD in Broward. Or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neil Rogers on news talk radio 610 WIOD. It's the larger two-hour. Okay, 106 at WIOD. Boy, this is so good today. Hmm. These cheesebread. Did you have any cheesebread? Not yet. Or is it? It's over there. Oh, there's more. Okay, because I don't want to wind up eating it all. I don't know. One other day when you got surly. Okay, you have a good one. You took a bite. See, things are shaping up now. You got all surly and hysterical because of that one. Pascodniac that cold earlier. No, I didn't. There's always got to be one. Yeah, no, I know. But I think it was all there for everybody to hear. I'm not closing anything hidden there. This is delicious. Okay. Yeah. Cremendous, really is. See, really don't remember the scene where Climenza was shoving the meatballs and the sauce and the, not real strong memory. I don't have to real. And Michael's on the phone and Kate says, I love you. Do you love me and he's out of talk later. She's, she haven't say it, Michael. And the Clemenza says, come on. I might keep telling. I said, girl, you love it. What's the matter? I don't see a suit. I'm going to die. I remember. I haven't seen it as many times as you have. But I do 4,500. I know. I have to be the whole, I know that. I can do the whole thing. I've only seen it 2 or 3 times. Anything interesting on there? On that screen? Oh yeah. There's a mobile and brow word. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. Hi, are you? Great. Hi, bird. How you doing? Okay. Just call for a quick comment. I think these guys that are calling ripping the bird are doing it out of the canve. Yeah, I mean, good thing. Yeah. Jell-o-C. Yeah. I always say that. In fact, that one guy that called. I heard a rumor during the newsbreak that he's hung like a pair of keys. He's hung like a pair of keys. Well, maybe they can get a job on the pirate station with the pirate there. There you go. Good idea. All right. Well, you guys have a good day now. You too. Good day. I got to find the right copy here. See this book. Now, what is Laura still working here? A location. Laura's not making it. Did they winter? No. Oh, Laura and this Ross? Something like that. Yeah. Right here in tier. You won't see no more of Ross or Todd in his room anymore. There's a conspiracy to keep them out. In fact, you may have something to do with it. But that's OK. I won't hold a grudge. There we have one. Nothing to that. I told you about that. About what? Nothing. Just minor. 13. No, there's no minor. Don't say, I'm not there. That's a round word to say on this show. We get some people very hysteria. Man, man, man, man, man. It's spelled the same, too. One-third-tated. Sheaps where to sleep anymore. It's 115 at WIOD. And this is the toughest half hour of the show. Here's a question about Johnny Darken plantation. Hello. Nice talking to you. West Palm Beach, hello. Oh, no. Yeah. I love your show. But I've been listening for two days, you know? Oh, man. All right. Well, who's that guy in the background? It's always laughing. I've been listening for two minutes. No, sir. Two days. Uh-huh. I've been listening for two minutes. No, sir. Two days. I think his name is Bird. Yeah. But what is he always laughing? Well, these can only be so good, you know? Deal? Come on, sir. Get to the palace for serious. Okay. How about this club, he's man? Now you're talking. How about that Mitch Webster, huh? He's awesome. I always like Mitch Webster. He's the best. Yeah. But um, and Sean Dunston. The braids are still good, too. Yeah. So it was eight games in a row. Hey, everyone, yesterday. They won the second game. And don't Murphy's doing pretty well. Yeah, he's up over 250 now. That's pretty exciting. Three for four. And Sean Dunston's over 200. So we're really doing it. Hey, Perry got hurt. Did he? Yeah, he for a dozen for plenty. Ender the shoulder. Well, that's where it goes. Hey, but he's still cool. That's what it took the clubs to get all their regulars in. You're to start scoring some runs. That's what it takes. All right, Neil. Okay. They have a little bird for me. See ya. Bye-bye. Sharon's writing a very complex note here. It says something about sleep away camp. Ha ha ha ha ha. Open line in Broward 524Wild. What is it? It's problem with the show. Ah, let's see if they can. Oh, oh. This is a special urgent message that the request of Sharon Mahoney. It steves request, like I said. Steve showed today has fallen through. It says, okay, fallen through as in a fallen apart. So as a result, Steve is going to be talking about Chinese abortions in the rotisserie league. And if the guests are listening, please go away. Okay. There are planes leaving for Beijing every hour on a hour. Go away. Don't darken the door of our building. Don't take it personally. I said, don't take it personally. But the show isn't going to happen. It's fallen through. It's a turkey. It's a bomb. It's going to happen. So go home and don't come to WIOD. If I go over to WIOLD, I'll put John. Mm-hmm. Okay. Anytime. Wow. It never happened. What? Since we've been here. That they've told the guests to, it hasn't. It hasn't? Well, not quite in that way. That way. This. There are a lot of things that happen. You know, changing world events. Yeah. Hmm. It's one-eighteen at WIOD. Well, these canolees are just incredible. Would you like a canolee, Steve? Would you like some salad there, so many pasta? I would love to. What's some parmesan cheese? Can you find a real like a mean, yeah, in the best of a person? Who am I playing? No, you'll put you like. I give everybody the lakers months ago and everybody was laughing that they were a bunch of old men and that they wouldn't make the finals in here. They are again. And L-white Detroit's asking about six I would say. Hmm. Oh, this is good. I did make your announcement by the way, but your guest, please go away. Yeah. I said don't take it personally, but get lost. Don't come near this building, okay? Because we have several Chinese revolutionaries at the door. And they're going to give you some tainted, wonton soup if you don't watch it, okay? See a better change your wonton ways. It's 119 and we got a car phone in Palm Beach on the Boca Line. Hello. Hello. Sounds good. See how quiet. Okay. Nice to see you in business with you. Sir, man, it... My amy. Hello. Yeah, how's it going? Great. Hey, go ahead and have a look. Who is this? There's nobody, you know? You should have a look. Is there anybody chronic? No, I don't think so. Okay. Okay. You should have stopped very familiar. Because I don't usually say who is this, you know? I plan to say all these people that ripping your apple through. And it's matter of fact you were, I mean, nearly you were asking about those, the bird on the end of the loop. Yeah. I think bird, I'll get you a copy of that. Oh, you got it? I've got that in the end, and the cackling and the other one. Can you put them on car? Yeah, there's the one. Yeah, we should put them on car. This one's a gym, yelping from... How's yelping? Uh, I don't know. Huh? That's one of my couple weeks ago. Yeah. He's doing good. He doesn't call us to see him. Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember the vaults you're last? Yeah, it was for the day. It's a copy of all that. Great. And listen, hey, yel, you're always talking about stuff on the weekends. They're really stuck to the tape stuff and the satellite stuff and stuff like that. Mm-hmm. Turn on D-chard this morning and they're playing tape term in a McBean. No, a kid. No, a vacation. No, I'm vacation. I know, but I mean, can't they put one of the junk dog on their own? Johnny Dolores, what do you mean they're playing tapes? Dolores and the boy. Oh, no. Ah! That's what I said. I mean, it was unbelievable. That's what Johnny Dolores doing the show. Do you mean they're playing their old tapes? How can you do that on a morning show? You can't play tapes on a morning show. Here's the traffic from my six weeks ago. Oh, it looks really bad out there. All the tourists aren't here. The French Canadians are got the whole turnpike died up. What a crappy way to do it, you know? I can't. I just just joined this place. There's a huge chance of pardoning expression. It was an abortion meal. Yeah. Well, you know, when in doubt, when you don't have any talent around, slap a tape on. That's their philosophy there for just a second. I don't know. It's not in that machine because that shut off. I mean, so I'm getting ready. I'm going to get out of here real quick today, because that game is very, very important in my life. Oh, we got Kilgis pitching today. Maybe I'll hang around. Oh, I don't like it. He's the only one of the club starters that you're really just, um, you have no faith in it all. He's mediocre, red vest and frightening at worst. But Bobby O'Hita is pitching for the clubs and for the mess. And his general average against the clubs this year and his previous appearance is 25. So I guess if we scored 20 runs against the O'Hita, that might be enough. Now, that guy you always talk about is this name, Shawin. Shawin Dunston, yeah. That's his real name. Yeah. I was just trying to picture parents with a little newborn baby. And SHAW-O-N. That's all the name they picked. Yeah, almost like oral. And that's weird. It's just odd. Like oral. Do you think that's an odd choice? Oh, no, I don't know what I was going to do. I just going to mention this. Steve said he's got two dinners at Burton Jacks. Are going to be the first prizes? Yeah. Yeah, that's right. Well, the best juniors. And he said the established juniors like Lee Harvey Oswald, Junior, Lee Fowler, Junior, whatever his name is. Lee Harvey Oswald. They can call, but they're not eligible for the price, because they're already established. These have to be people in the audience who are working and being creative. And they can be like Alice, Rental, Junior, or they can be the Be Yellowish, Junior, or Steve, or Mike Reneri, Junior, and they can repeat everything twice. However, they want to do it. Wow. Lake Worth. Yeah, hey, now. Yeah. I'm about baby's name when they're born. How about putting it? Yeah. You were talking about the station management in a world law bill. And I got a pretty interesting tape, I think you'd want to hear that some comments you made a while ago about them. Mm-hmm. Hang on a second. Oh my god, are you serial men? Mr. Disney, you're a disgrace. You're a disgusting, you're a subhuman, you're a jerk, you're an idiot. Well, we already know all. Ha ha ha. 1401, a WIO dimming. No, something that we don't know. Come on. You already know. 655, WIO dimming. We got four-laterdale. Hello. Hello. I'm a Cub Span and a Bushman. Are you? Could I speak to the bird, please? Go right ahead, sir. Hey, bird. Yeah. Who's that guy that's with you there? It's always eating. Ha ha ha ha ha. That's cute. Hey, you're doing a great job, and I love bad radio. Yeah. Only problem is I'm leaving this place in nine days. Where you going? Michigan. Oh, come on. This is a great time of the year to be going, too. Yeah. You mean you're leaving for good? No, no, four months. Four months. I gotta do my time. Where are you going? South Western, Michigan, Northern Indiana, and Riggly. Do you know where how Indiana is? It's about five miles from Ship, Chihuahua. I lived there once. Yeah, I know. I heard that. Wait, wait, wait. Well, one second, sir. Ship, Chihuahua. Yeah. I heard a ship, Chihuahua. No, come on. I'm going to spell that. Don't say it again. Ha ha ha ha. I wouldn't dare try that one again. Now, at least you remember the part where a Clemente's wife says they're leaving the house. And she says, don't forget the Canole. Oh, that's, and they take a fully out in the Boondox there and they shoot him in a Leave him in the car. And as they're leaving, Clemente says to the Other guys, take the Canole. Yeah. Plastics. Yeah. Oh, and leave the Canole back in the car with a dead Rodney scene. Uh, he says, how's Pauli doing? Do you want to see him no more? Hmm. I could just do the whole dial. I know. We might do that one day. Okay. You could. You didn't want to be my friend. Uh, in fact, that's where Marlon Brando said to Michael Jackson. And next thing you knew he moved in. Yeah. You never want to. My friendship. You were afraid. 1. 48 a W.I.O.D. Our first call is in Dave County. Hello. The Norm can eat the eaters, the pastory, go to history. Boca. Hello.
