Well, he would like to say hello. He'd like to mend his face. What is it like? I don't like to do any questions. Okay. I want to know what you're dying to get to this over with. Yes, I am. I'm anxious. Because I have no complaint with you, Mr. Carl. I like to do that. I shouldn't have this. I don't. I'd be the one. Bill, I listen to you back on the great entertainer. I don't go back into his. That's like saying, you remember when I was in the cupboard. Why is it? I've always enjoyed you. I don't know. I've never ripped you on or on. Never. Never. I hate your guts. Why do you hate me? I'm going to be honest. Sorry, I'm going to tell you. What an old one. I like this. From the very, you know what, when his nostril start flaring like this? No, I'm going to be honest with him. I'm going to be honest with him because I need deserves an answer. Go ahead. Very beginning. When Neil said he was going to have a sidekick. Yes. I told him. I thought it was a great idea. But to for God's sake, don't get a Gentile. I said, get a Gentile. I said, get a Gentile. I said, get a Gentile. I said, get a Gentile. I said, get a Jewish guy. Excellent point. So this is my big crime. Your agentile. Society is not going to come. No. I did take exception to a few things. You said because I'm not to try to take cheap shots of people. He's got, I have never ripped you. Any comment I made about you? No, I'll tell you that. Would you like to rip? We're running out of time. I know we're getting closer to the news. Let me just say, implosing. That a couple of times I felt you jumped in and you were much too quick. Two. What is it? Don't use that rip. When I rip, no. But two. Totally take a shot at me. I do what? It's a subtly take a shot. Number one, you always give me a hell about some colours as he's privy to do that. You know what? I might call you a show this morning saying, that's what I mean. And then you jumped right in and said, yeah. And Lester called to me. I like this like I did say it. It's not impindous. Secondly. Secondly. What he couldn't find my ratings? Which are hard to find. I agree. You said, well, I'm not going to say anything because you'll think I'm attacking him or something to that effect. I'm not going to say anything. But I know why you can't find his ratings because he doesn't have any. You are too sensitive. You are ridiculous. Let me ask you a question. Listen to me. Listen to yourself right now. And then tell me, I'm sensitive. I'm laughing. I'm having a great time. I'm sensitive to your worst of me. I never thought I would encounter my entire life here. I'm here to have a good time. I'm built. Built closer than I are here. I'm seeing these to find some soundtracks. I can't hear you. I heard the big charge. I know what my crime is now. I'm a Goysha cup. You've got me. You've got me. You've got me. Well, that's bad of it. No, but you have that Gentile humor. It's not. You heard it. It's right. It's not ripping me to you. But it's a Gentile humor. See, Jews can attack me. And I see. Now, this answers my other question. He's beaten on me for about 14 years. It's true. And it was all true. That's right. Exactly. I remember the first time when he came to me for a job. It's true. The first thing I asked him was, not where he'd worked or do you have a tape or anything. I said, are you Jewish? Bill. Let me tell you something. I'm a Jewish. I'm a Jewish. My girlfriend is Jewish. People, my landlords are Jewish. I work with someone who's Jewish. I'm an honorary Jew. He lives in Kendall. Yes. You're going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I'm going to tell you something. I have a lot of friends who are Jewish. I know Neil Rogers and he's Jewish. And I'm going to tell you something. You're no Jew. Ha! He's got my vote. Now, I'm going to leave. Have we settled this? I have we? I think so. I think he puts you to rest. Did you hear? I got to come back from that. The last thing I did today was I had a little... ...we have a little brass pot in the studio. The pot? Yes. Did you grease it up a little bit? He said, I'll rest it up. And through and a rat. No, I'm going to kidding. But you have to remember Glenn. What was that mystery sound by the way? Glenn, you've taken a lot of kidding. Sit you but on the show. Because you don't do anything like that. And you have to learn to take a joke. This is all a joke. I've never even even known you. That's what I thought. So how come I don't even like you and I don't even know you. Ha! It's a needle. No. It's all in the spirit. You should have learned this from Neil. Exactly. Neil is... He's learned nothing. Ha! There's... OK. OK. Is it... Are we friends again? Are we? No. No. No. No. OK. Well, I think we have cleared that up real clear for you. And we're almost at the end of the hour. Now, when is the food coming? Ha! I've got to go get some CDs. It's been great. You know, I get some race Stevens, man. You're not playing it up these days. And we got some... Don't you want to eat anything? Come on. Don't act in. Same thing. You're so... Come on. Be fat like me. Be fat like me. Exactly. Mystery loves company. You know, Cheddar Stan and... No. We... I have to offset each other. OK. Have a wonderful life. And I'll see you at the track. Anyway, it's... We've got some stuffed shells. I think I may just have a little touch of that. Pistramy, little pizza. Some of the rabbi. Everything is delicious. And... We want to thank everybody who brought the food by Steve from Steve's pizza. Right? TV's pizza. Now, you all straighten out with him. Is that all clear to him? I'm going to talk to him during the break. And then we'll find out. I'll report back to you. Oh, he says he wants to talk to you during the break. Off the air. Off the air. Yeah. OK. Chuck Myers, Danny, by and he's got the noon Wiod News. We'll come back in 12ifies. Anybody know what Steve is doing today? Does anybody hear? Does anybody hear? Does anybody hear? And he'll... He'll sit thumbs down. Abortion. OK. They said Steve would be doing another abortion today, too. And we'll come back. Live from the brand who's specs the North Miami in 12.05. Yeah. You're good way to do it. And you can put you in your cage real good. Oh, did he? Kind of stirred that pot when he was here a little bit, Danny? Exactly. OK. I'll see you at the recent great to see you. On bowl. We remember the story, some of us. OK. Anyway, what are we doing? Are we doing all I will? I promise I swear to a madlittle hero. OK. My hand on the start. OK. I'll listen, Dion is going to be here any second. If he can get through this wild crowd, he's going to be here at noon. OK. Take care of yourself. I guess he's going to bring it up. Yeah. He's going to possibly bring his guitar or not. He's a case may be. And it's going to be great. And I got a little of my gas here in the water. And everything is under control. This has been just more. See, when you come out, it really brings out the way. See, brings out the words. Yeah. Are we throwing all this huzz or riot here? Please, Sully-Gran. I'm going to have just a little tea. I don't want to go overboard. But the people from possibilities, we want to thank for bringing all of that. Yeah, they bought it. If I didn't taste the shells, they would be crushed. Wouldn't they? Yeah. Devast, I think you get a little plate. Well, I don't want to hold things. OK. Let's give the numbers out. Just a case. There are people who still want to call in the case. We can hear any of the callers, which is unlikely. We have a full board of calls. See, we don't have to beg for calls when we do this. They're because for some reason, when they're in the studio, they hate us. But when we're out and about, they just go nuts. And of course, Rogers on the board today, so we know that we'll actually get one or two legitimate calls before the end of the show. And that's all I'm having just a little taste of. Does anybody who wants this, what are we going to do with this? Well, you should take it back there to John. Aren't they eating back there? Over here, they got a table. Oh, you have to go ahead. No, but just don't, what's up the floor? That's all I, oh, don't drop the cheese. Oh, God, they got this beautiful new place here. And these people are going to think out of it. What's up the joy? We got a hand. And the number. Oh, cheese. What are you, sir? Something, OK. Yeah. What is fingers? He's eating stuff. Oh, go ahead. Please, you can't do too much damage with that. We got jury veil. I'm going to sing a medley of his, it's like jury veil. Yeah. Yes. Of course, these people don't even know jury veil. No, no, no, you know jury veil. Does he look just like him? Yeah. Yeah. OK. Who's this for? Who want, oh, it for you? You don't look like you needed, sir. I, yeah. Yeah, right. You haven't done enough sharing even from what it looks like. OK, it's 12 away to WOD. Let's have a bunch of a call and see if there's any chance that we can hear the vocal voice. First, what we could also do. On this man's, oh, cheese. Doctor Vinny B. It says on this man's body, Doctor Vinny B. Oh, yeah. Oh, we're looking at this. We love the pictures. Yeah, there's a few of stiffs lying in a street waiting for you to get on a way across our bedroom. Oh, but. OK, and have a couple of families before your surgery. It'll help your eyesight. It'll get your blood sugar back up. Doctor Vinny B isn't he a peeper today? Yeah. Man, this celebrity. I'd like to be sitting in his waiting room, huh? Boy, he is. The celebrities here today is just, but it's all down. I wouldn't be surprised if Don Agony go to up here on noodles. And happen. We're still waiting for Irene, right? Yeah, waiting for Irene. Anybody from love 94 has been here. And he fell on my jaw. He doesn't be a good challenger. When it's in stay, been calling and alleging that they want to go in. We're very close to where he lives. I bet to this crowd would go nuts if Keith Allen came in and kissed and made up with you right in the middle of the day. I'll bet. They'll call their face, meet face to face, and we had it out on the air. And I found out my crime. And I would be surprised if Joey stops by two to plug that sick TV show at his. I have no argument with Joe. Speaking of kissing and making him was this may gone again today. Boy. Boy. Boy. I would give it like, do you know what I showed? Oh, yeah. We got to talk about, no, we don't have to talk about anything in his break. We just have to do a little break. And we'll come back where it's specs. The brand new one on this game Boulevard between 124th and 125th. Right next to Wendy's and just have a block away from that. And he's deli where they sent it to the Lishes, Pistromes. What are you laughing about? Go ahead and tell him about Goishadeli. Bill Callers today. He wouldn't know Pistromes if he was a caller boss. He's going, okay. Look at right back from specs.
