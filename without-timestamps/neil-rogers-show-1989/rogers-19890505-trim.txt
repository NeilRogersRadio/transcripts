I'm a cup, Dan. I know, but Dan, and I trust you, Art. What is that? Wow, thank you, Sharon, so much. 10.06. The WI did. Do you think we got this word supposed to be? I don't know. You don't even know what it is. No. You don't? Hmm. I'm going to call Johnny Dark and tell him you're slipping. What is it? By the way, my horse, where to come in way back is, today, made a little moving the stretch and he's still running at highly. Yeah, that's all the way. And I'm not picking one today because I'm picking, um, for the Derby tomorrow. What's the one I picked? Sunday silence with Pat Valentine's Waila. I mean, anybody can pick easy gore. Okay, we got something here from Spak, Saudi like that. So many things going on here. We got Johnny Dark on a four, but he's going to hold, right? Yeah, I just, I just call up. I was going to get a little bit closer by jamming Americans. Hold on. Hold on. I just, we got to, oh, we got to collect call from Washington. Hello. Yes. Click call from Washington. Yes. Zeta Spire report here. You know, Washington? No, I think Washington. Now, listen, yesterday they're doing it. What do you mean it is in Washington? It says on a board, collect Washington, D.C. Well, I told Mrs. Zeta Spire report. Wait a minute, give me the wrong number. Just a second. That's on four. When you mean it's on four, Johnny Darks on four. Well, Roger is just abs. I know it's Friday, but poor Roger is just crumbling, falling apart at the seams. Go ahead as long as you're on there. Hey, what is it only taking second? Oh, okay. Yesterday they're playing Led Zeppelin, hold out a love. Well, that's shocking. Yeah. What's the talk of KC in the background? You know, doing his little thing, you know, with the Donna LeBone. Oh, no. And then they're slipping in another talk up with, but they're doing well. You know, I knew Jack Kennedy, you know, that, or we, you know, hold you from that. Oh, mixing that all together. Wow. Was this on Gondr show? No, this is on, uh, it was about three. Oh, the, oh, the afternoons? Yeah, about three clocks. Oh, thank you, Agnano. That's a bitter pill to swallow. I'll tell you that. Well, listen, well, the way I'm slapping, unbelievable bumper stickers on all the rental cars I can find. Okay, slap it. And listen, Glenn? Yeah. You're not a pretty rat. Take it easy, guys. Why? I didn't give it. I didn't either. But it must've been good. Uh, 751 W.Y.D. and Dave, 524 W.Y.D. There's an open line at Broward. The Washington D.C. call is on. Now, wait a minute. Are you still there, Johnny? Yeah. Okay. Hello. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? Okay. How you doing Neil Glenn? We're doing okay. Like I just said, you know. Yeah. You're on three. Okay. So when we put you back on hold on a second, you'll know. That's absolutely. So what do you want? I just talked to you guys. Well, you know how nice it is up here today. It's a real rainy. Yesterday was beautiful. Well, it's not a shining. It's going to be about like 85, 88 today. Something like that's beautiful here. People are more ons, but it's beautiful. Oh, you should see it up here. There's restaurants. Things to do. It's great to be out of that town. Yeah. Just wanted to call saying hello for another 10 on the board from Washington DC and wanted to call Marvin and Rick Duce back. Okay. Well, we'll put you. We'll put the pin right next to the Oli North Memorial Pinnon in our map. Okay. Let me on over the wall. Right next to the federal penitentiary. Okay. You want to be on hold? Yeah. Okay. Well, he's on hold, John. How do you like that? That's amazing. That was a good. That we got that Zeta Spirey port before your call. Yeah. You got somebody on here that wants to talk to you. How do you like that? What? What? We got somebody on here that wants to talk to you. Can we do this? I knew. Johnny, are you there? I'm here. This is what I want to ask Johnny. Would you please tell him you're in the bridge that way back when that um, Torxster did do a song called Johnny Dorxos going to town? Uh-huh. Yeah. What? He didn't do that. I sang that for Christmas. Oh, why don't you bring that in? Because I'd like to hear it. Because I don't have a copy of it. Oh, come on. I don't only only how it was a copy of that. Oh, I'll never really say. Oh, I was in the dry. Okay. All right. Thanks. I want to make it. It's a minute. Okay. Amazing. Yeah, it was. And I was saying I'm out of material before I started because you took away what I was calling about. We took away your, we stole your thunder. Yeah, I was going to call up and get guests the record. Oh, well, how about? Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. No, no. See, I even said that count me and isn't on the CD and you're guessing count me in. Boy, you guys both have lost it. You'll ever get hired back in Sherry Shoto again. I'll tell you that. Wow. Did you hear us play the new colony six yesterday, John? Yeah. Well, I didn't know that that was on CD. Isn't that great? In fact, not only is it on CD. I think I still got it here, but it's the, you know, how they have records on the front pictures of records on some of these CD. Oh, yeah. It's got the picture of that particular record. I'm going to be on that 10 and, um, wait a minute. Let me find it. And didn't we literally, you know, on a 10 and red member with this kind of like Stripes, curved stripes? Oh, yeah. I have a copy here. I'm sure you do probably have several. How people are baseball cars. Johnny Dark is got, he trades records like that's why. Because he's stolen them from the best stations in America. And many of most of them are in mint condition. They've never been touched by a needle. Yeah. But the trouble is that that's way too much of a hit for the new colony six. You have to go deeper into that CD. Oh, deeper. You have to go deeper in that. Lots of the ones that, you know, we're not quite. First of all, it's not a new colony six CD. It's a mercury collection volume three 45's on CD. This is a great collection, by the way. I've got at least seven seven records here by the new colony. You don't have, if I can get the crying shames on CD, I would just about kill for that. Yeah. But no luck. I have it on record. I got it. Well, anybody can get it on record. Did you hear? I like it like that by Chris Kiner on CD. Oh, yeah. Wow. God only knows what this country's coming to next. And some of those are actually original recordings. Mm-hmm. Yeah, one or two. Yeah. I love it when he played the ones that are echoing and have a big audience in the background and recorded an agraron. Well, good. I got a whole bunch of those were playing ball today. That'll kill some good time in between eating a Chinese food. Yeah. Anyway, I'm probably out of material now. Okay. You guys have a good weekend. Good day. Okay. There he goes. Johnny Darkner. That's not the Johnny Darkner used to work on WMCA. That is the Johnny Darkner used to be a chupershure. Fire at boom, boom, cannon or something like that. Did he fire him? Yeah. Wow. Yes, he did. I guess he shed the wrong thing. Like the 1023WID. Okay up there now. Okay. Hold on. I'd like to make sure our callers on hold are doing okay. We like to check on him once in a while because if anything happened, we could call a paramedics or whatever. This Saturday, it's tomorrow, right? At Highly, you can not only see the Kentucky Derby, but you can bet on it too. I think I'm going to call Dave Johnson a little later on in the show because I got his number in the ABC TV trailer. Mm-hmm. And Dave was kind enough to send the post positions just moments after they were drawn at Louisville yesterday. So we had him first. I would think Louisville as in Louisville sluggish. You know, boy Gary. Yeah. Is that could be any ideas boy Gary like getting on the bus? You can still make, you can still make well pack your sandwiches. Anyway, the Derby will be telecast, televised. What did they call it? Symbolcast at Highly at Amara and you can bet on it. Okay, now you're shmarles out there. You go ahead and bet easy gore and one to two or two to five whatever he's going to be. I like Sunday silence. I'm just, do you want to make a pick? Here I'll give you the list. Those are the only two. Come on, now let's get serious. Also the feature tomorrow at Highly at Be the $175,000 black hell on a handy cap. Ravenella heads a field on that one. And then on Sunday it's the $50,000 dolphin handy cap and a bet you're so Joseph Gackie gets out for that one too. We got to talk about you on a second here about that article by Dave Hyde. And don't forget, I know it's a little ways off, but the last day of Highly is racing season. That's a Sunday, May 28th, Highly will feature free admission for all on that day. So get out and bet the Derby tomorrow, post time 1 pm at Highly at the one that I kind of am just a shoshish. A shoshish about is the one that says Goldberg on King. Yeah, so I think he's one of the most more despicable people I've met. Neal's good, he's funny, but Steve's not a funny guy. What I don't like is he's an uninformed guy trying to bring attention to himself. I took real exception to him after going after the Gackie. Joe works 60 to 70 hours a week does a great job. King does nothing. He gets his audience from Neal in a minute and he leaves. He's back to a field goal. Woo! What a shy brush Steve told us they had made up and they were busy. Not anymore. And then Zagaki on Rogers, this is good when he's been doing the same thing for years now. He rips the sales department on Monday. He rips management on Tuesday. And rips are department on Wednesday. It's part of his show. Now we don't just rip the sales department on Tuesday. Okay, that's where you're very wrong or Monday, whatever he says. Speaking of that, look at that. Here's the problem. And God only knows. Now Disney's working on a, in fact, they got the fun of the big shots from Atlanta. They're working on a group session in San Diego. You know, where they perform as little lobotomies. They're going to send the entire sales department out there. And just reach into their brains and pick out those little, That's about little things. Yeah. So anyway, I'm sure a lot of you saw that and that'll, Saw all of the guy in Washington didn't see it, right? Is he going? No, you didn't see it. How'd you see it? I was there just yesterday. Well, let's in this morning's paper. Oh, I get the paper up here too. Yeah. This is starting to sound real. It's a real shaky now. You don't know how Lee North do you? Oh, we went out by the cord house yesterday. There were a lot of reporters. We didn't get to see him though. Uh-huh. It was pretty wild over there. Does he call you once in a while? All in now. No. Is sure now. Never sent you any travelers checks or anything? No. No, please. Okay, hold on. Starting to sound real shady. And on him, I'm saying anyway, that wasn't the record I had. Johnny hysterical. Well, I know which one I had cute up. So anyway, they were doing on Zeta. I still can't get over that spy report. Yeah. But they're doing talk ups with Casey Kasem and... Oh. Dave, this is... Well... Everybody's been fighting and judging after. Everybody loves a clown. Why don't you? That wasn't bad. Not bad at all. No. Bestie for a kid. For a little kid. That makes me mad. What they're doing over there. So therefore, I'm going to retaliate today. Uh-oh. Now, to mark our six-month anniversary here at IOD, which is coming up in just a few days. Well, it's today. Because it's a day. All the days of the fifth and we started the seventh. Well, unless we're coming in on Sunday. No, we're not. So in honor of... Well, our six-month anniversary, I'm going to tell a story about Zeta that has never been told on the air before today. Yeah. Jochen. Yes. That's about as exciting and judging after everybody. Yeah. That was pretty tight, huh? Little too tight. Not bad. Everybody loves that. That I say and do. Thanks again to my friends at Specs for making this show liveable today. I got this de-on thing. I'm going to play all of them. I'm just going to go nuts today. We've got a lot of calls on here, but who needs them, right? But we better take these mobbles because they'll go away. Thank you. Thank you. It's about time, right? James enough is enough already. I'm right. You're going to like this. Okay. On Sunday, I was looking to show a Meg someone a rather. Uh-huh. She, uh, she had doors. You, I don't know if you can. And believe me, she called you the King of Talk radio. No. He's honest to God. He said, you've brought thousands of listeners over to the station. You've done more for this. I'm being serious. Well, that makes she really has been sucking around lately. Has she? No. She's great. She really is. When she gets done here, is when she calls her an area in the morning. Ah! Right? She's a free promo man, desperate. When you work here, you've got to get promos anyway. Because it's always a big secret. She really wants a bath boy. I'll tell you. Not to that too bad. To bed for me? To bed for yes. She wants a bath for you. And no. She really stuck up. She's one call they call in. How could you be on the station? That's what she wanted. Oh, she's. You know, these. She's doing, I was a. What was it? A little bag. The call them? It was an old bag in a half. Yeah. Oh, man. You're so refined and so wonderful. How could you be done with that douchebag of me? Say it in so mag. Dusty road is going to be here today. He is. You first. Says what it says in the sun sent. I say night bears award. All look at that. He's back to that wrestling stuff. Oh, he rode. Well, he fit into the studio seat. Well, he pounded me off. Oh, well, we'll go up. All you wrestling, Eddie. It's all of those. That I can you have under two wrestling on the cane show today. And, of course, Steve will be wrestling with his conscience all weekend after doing that show. Was it on Monday that Hank and Joe were blasting someone or rather? I didn't. I don't hear sports talk very often unless I'm in the car. Hank was running and raving. He called someone an apple. He called Steven Assoi. He was. Yeah. It was really ranting and I never heard of him. And that was the nice part. That was a compliment compared to the rest of it. It's not. You two are very similar. I don't know if you. Who said you and Hank? Oh, yeah. You're very out there. Well, we're both badly both like the horses. There are some differences. I will say that right up front. You both had a breath. You know, you both had a lot of things. That is correct. Yeah, we're both Jewish. Yeah. We both don't go to shoul. In fact, Hank works on Shabbos just out of spite every week. Well, you're very nice boys. And you're really, you really are, you know, I think doing a lot of the station. That's what butter is exciting. And Joe's a gackie. Well, I think I'm more excited because Joe's a gackie. Don't start now. Thank you very much. OK. Bye. Bye. Don't start. Dave Hyde will have another big expo Zaynex week. Let's see, is there something on here that I want to play? Boy, oh, yeah. This is the one. These guys, it specs made our whole stinkin' show today. You know? Oh. Oh. MN34 on I-61. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I could tell you something. I'm all good. Look at in the red. I wish today to world my friends would stop me and say that. Oh, this is a great, great deal. It's cool, OK. Sounds great. Mm-hmm. And then this, uh, I think you can just look them right ahead on a here. Don't can't you? When she kissed me, I was born that she is said goodbye. Yeah. And I knew right. I was born that I was born. 1035. I'll tell you one thing, you know, Bill Wise, he's all excited because they got a good book over. They got another one. Those clook months of GPR. And he's got all these. Did you see him on the wall? Yeah. You know, that's pretty tacky. You know what? I mean, we go out of our way here to try to, in fact, even cleaned up the studio because Mike, what's his name from Atlanta came into the day. And he wanted to make it look like the place was really neat and refined and we're not a bunch of slabs which we are. And here, Spike Wise got the wall with all these tacky postures with GPR bumper stickers on them with a big numbers. GTR. And then she and then Zeta weighed down in a little tiny project of all, you know, which was a bitter pill for them to swallow over there. They've been swallowing a lot of bitter pills over there, you know what? And when you tell that disgusting story, I'll later on. Well, a little later on. And the show, we don't want to. We don't like to release the good stuff right in the beginning. We like to kind of hold back something. That's right. By the way, if you weren't listening yesterday, we got the Palm Beach book here. And we kicked some serious ass on this show and Palm Beach in the book, okay, which is why nobody would said it to us. But we have a Palm Beach spy who passed it long. And in all the meaningful demographics, we kicked the daylight out of G&O, out of PBR. In fact, out of the both of them put together, my favorite, let's say, 10 to 3. My favorite number. There's one that's higher, 18 to 34 men. But in persons 25 to 54, we had a 5, 3, and J&O had a 2, 3. PBR had a 0.6. So we doubled the two of them put together. Just about about our market. Yeah. It's not even our market. We beat the crap out of you, fakers up there in Palm Beach, okay? In men, why am I mentioning this again? Because I like it. I'm a junior in G&O. That's because they don't want us to know this. Exactly. That John Fakano, that paranoid douchebag up there at J&O, men 25 to 54. We had a only an 83 in a Palm Beach book. J&O had a 39 and PBR had a 1.2. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, okay? We do have a lot of people in Palm Beach. Yeah. Just a bunch of anti-social morons, okay? Now we're two dumb to dial the number. We are sending this spy a goal star in a purple jail. We're going to name two of them. Two. Yeah. 1037 and WINO's. The car hood is open right now as we speak. So those of you who are starving physically as well as wendelty, we invite you to go over to Char Hutton, get out of that junk food habit. There is no way to go. You're going to go. You bet we don't have time to play the whole record. That was the thing about the difference between F and A. When we were on F, you did the talk ups. And then you played the record. Now, if we're at A, you do the talk ups. We don't play the record. That's the difference, right? But we have F and A. That's basically the difference. Plus on the F, you get your boat channels. Other than that. Or that. That was shocking. That was surprised by a small part. It's 1040 at WIOD. Then he'll rod your show with Glenn Hill the bird. That's much of that. Because then boy you're in an after-do a whole thing about it. Wow, they don't know what show they're most in the middle of your name. Yeah, that's why we do so well. That's why we have these gigantic numbers because they don't know the name of the station or the frequency. What they're listening to. And I'll just please. You know, on boy you're they even though. I know this is incredible. And he's like a bully me for a second. They even though. By the way, where is my check? They even though who comes on after us. Where is my check? Hank Goldberg knows who comes on after us. Is anybody in a building got my check like Cheryl? Because I know we got these big wigs and all these big powows and confaps going up. But I like to start early on this because they do have a 10% seizure for get. Don't they every Friday it's like a big it's embarrassing to have talk about it in the air. Wait a minute. Don't keep it in the wrong one there. It must be a reason for that. You know what I'm saying? Are you there? Yeah, I'm still here. Okay. But it's just something I got to do because it's the only way I get it. If I didn't talk about it on the air, I'd never get to check. So I could go in a hallway and do it inside private. But then they'd look at me in a lamp. But on the air, it's kind of like there's a lot of public pressures that way. Okay, let's take this mobile if there's still, I can't believe I was still here. Well, you're incredible. Neil Burr and Kate Bouse. Yeah. You're doing good? Easy for you to say. Listen, I was going to call and guess everybody loads of clowns for the African casualty. Yeah, that was, you're going to have your last national. You're going to have your I-95 asset casualty. You can't afford in the males. I can't wait. Don't leave your name in a dress. Just keep looking. I did rock bottom in the traffic today on the chronic cavity. I hid rock bottom today. Yeah. I guess I look at somebody. I said, can I please get a had a year? They just look at me and said, no. And we'll let you go. Yeah, that's right. But at least they were honest. Okay. They didn't pull one of these deals where they pretend like they're going to let you win. And then just as you start, try to work your way in and then they floor it. You know, they didn't do that. I feel like I want to go back to New York. Oh, no, don't say that. Wait, I want to see what I'm talking about. I'll say that New York is like 50 billion pounds of garbage. You know, I said you don't want to go back there. I mean, just because they got all kinds of things going on and it's a lot of fun. That's no excuse. All right, listen, I just want to prove to my fish back. Because I'm gallery that it's me. Well, and I come all the way. Frankly, my, I don't give it to you. Okay, pal. He's gone. And he has gone. All he did was get blurt that out. And I was the Eric Kamerot a user by the way. Get it right. 1043, we have an open line in Brower in at 524Wildy. That's the Johnny Darkline. Wow. Wow. I'm a style of you so much. Oh, that's true. You want to be on the same line that Johnny Darkball did. You need to be called a free time for your touch. Oh, it's Sandy by Deion. Hmm. I've heard that. I don't know why. I think I got it. I'll bet a lot. The next time Sandy, I got to tell you that would do. We got a great record here for one of our all-time chronic listeners who just she threatens that she's going to show up on Saturday tomorrow. That is. We're going to be a noon to three at boats our us. Who's that? Donna. Donna. The long way, Donna. Don't you think? The one. Donna. This is a tough one. Donna. This is a tough one. Donna. Yeah. Really, Donna. Kids, you know what I try this at home? No. What do you do? I made do an hour of letting the audience try talk up. But don't practice at home. We can't alone unless you're accompanied by an adult over 90 with blue hair and blue shoes. Because you could just absolutely devastate yourself. Donna. Like that. It's always hot with that. Well, it's just you can't really do it because it's, you know, it's constant. It's a never really sounds clean. I thought it was pretty good. Yeah, it was, but it wasn't. My feelings are hurt. Oh, it was pretty good. Fuck, I'm alive. Very good. Very good. What is it? Huh? The other one was very difficult. But it was there. I mean, it just, there's like a whole bunch of something starting at the same test. Now this one I guarantee is nailed. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. She can mess around with me once, but 1045 at WIOD. Here's another mobile on it. Palm Beach line. Hello. Gay, 9. Nice. Stay. Oh, wow. The Palm Beach is open. It's 645. Told you we're a big in Palm Beach tonight. 655 WIOD. It was probably John Fakano calling into congratulators on our big numbers in the Palm Beach book. Don't you think? Yeah, no joke. I don't doubt it for a minute. Dear field, hello. Morning. Yes, sir. Yeah. Just a couple of quicksumpti. Okay. We were at the promotional, the Hollywood Saturday and came out of the former, a treated impulse or the cars. Great. That's good. Excellent deal. Excellent. And just wanted to say quick thing to Barry Epstein Jr. On eating, to your bag. I work with him. Do you? Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess it runs in the family, you know? Yeah. Well, we're leaving. We're taking your advice. We're bailing out of the state. Are you serious? Yes, sir. Boy. We'll give you a call when we get there. Where you going? Boston, Massachusetts. You're going to Boston? Boston. You can listen to Jerry Williams and he can have your rip-up, your ex on credit card. That'll be great. That's wonderful. And Larry Glick, and you can start your own lemonade stand. That'll be a lot of fun. Well, you know what they say about Boston, don't you? What's that? It might not be as bad as everyone says. Okay. Good luck to you. You're on Joy-Fanway Park. You ever been there? Oh, yeah. I was brought up there. Oh, yeah. I love fanway Park. I used to go there and just hang out all day. Okay. Good luck to you. I'll give us a call from up there now. Sure. Okay. Bye-bye. You know he will. What's just happened on the phone there? We had a line go out. No. Then 46. And I wonder if the guy in DC is still there. No, you're still here. Well, that's his lot for how exciting it is. You mean you didn't even do it here today? It's raining. You didn't even listen to Howard's during this morning? No. I caught a little bit of John DeBella last night on TV. Oh, you catch John DeBella. You got to go to a specialist. Hold on. Hold on. And that sounds like some kind of a vanilla disease. John DeBella? Okay. I don't want to talk to these people. I want to play music. Oh, yeah. What a sound. I'm down deep in the sight I've brought. I want to know where my check is. Without you alone. And I want to know where the Chinese boot is too. Other than that. You know you drive me wild. I am. You're such a little evil track. Now, I want you to listen. I want you to listen to the what's that? What are those? Seven and a half eight and a half and nine. What are those? Nice judging your. Oh, I got you know it's Friday, Roger. I'm not that sharp on Friday that I can follow that. No, but I've got now. I want you to listen to the instrument and see if it doesn't sound like Zom fear or the pan flute. On this record, I listen. I get you. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Very similar. Yeah. I never saw Zom fear and D on together either. Did you get it? So that I think answers a lot of my questions. Okay, both those Palm Beach lines are open. But you know something I don't care. Now that we have the Palm Beach book and hand, we see that we're just absolutely knocking their butts off up there. We don't fear a lot of noise in the background. I'm opening these. Don't you think there's a better way to package CDs? Don't you think if you know they've been around long enough now. Like two years ago, we were saying pretty soon they'll come up with a better way to package them. They do this so that people don't kids don't steal them. That's really the main reason they make them so big. But wouldn't there be a better way? Seriously. It's a good thing. Yeah, it's to open up a CD. I mean, by the time you get through ripen is cardboard and you're writing your fingernails and standing on your head, you're apoplectic. Now do I have time to read the radio how it's the other way? No, I have to read it. Okay. After the break, I want to talk about Toyota of Hollywood, where the previous caller who knows Brian Epstein Jr. He's that he got a great deal. And you will too when you deal with Toyota of Hollywood. See, if it sounds like I'm obsessed with that jingle and you know, it's a shame not to come back with music and not sure. I see I wasn't going to let it happen twice in the same show. I got burned early right at the beginning. I was not going to get burned twice in a row. Anyway, we're really Gary Lewis and a playboy's intensive today because Steve did that you on Jerry Lewis a couple of days ago and we're just delighted to give Gary all the all the publicity he wants and probably be in my an ask cap for, setting him up like crazy too. Miami, hello. Hey Neil, I was hanging. Okay. This one where you know that. I asked my dog that question nice. And I'm going to give me a dirty look. How is your dog? Are they doing? They're doing just great. They're crazy as a bed bug. How they're still going wild? Well, they're okay. That'll be all right. Joseph Kackie does really suck with that. Oh come on, that's terrible to say. That's horrible. Anyway, I'm going. It might not be as bad as everyone says. Yeah. By the way, the cup's one last night, four nothing. Mike Balekki, I mean yesterday afternoon, puts to five hitter a complete game and it was just marvelous. Can I talk now? No. No, listen. My girlfriend and I are going up to Disney World. Well, are you trying to suggest you don't care about the car? I'm American Lee fan. Oh, no. What do you know like Joseph Kackie? Um, you know if any good restaurants up in the Orlando area? No. 1054, WIOD. We have an open Friday date. Seven. Well, he doesn't care about the cups. I'm not giving him any restaurants. Go to Crystal, OK, pal. It'll fit your tasted baseball. Oh, they got steak and shake in the morning. No, don't give them that. That's too good. On radio today, this Saturday this morning's hero.

I think should business owners be responsible if drugs are sold on their prime. Baby, she will. Oh, hey. But then what would I say? Are we going to owe LB? What's all my minds? Seven. The words are how you fight. But I'm going to tell her anyway. Meal renders. Yes. 10? What we made it? Yes, it is. We're in a hero? Yes. I love you. I love you. Who's responsible for that? He's an orange-owned provocateur. Whoever he is, yeah. Two p.m. Ow, ran. Whatever you got, oh, that's my check. Like I said, please come in. Both of you. What? Boy. Now, how do you happen to have my check? Well, thank you so much. But I mean, I get it from somebody different all the time. You didn't want to bother me while I was on a year. I got news for it. This comes first. What's on the year is just to fill out a time. Thank you so much. Thank you very much. And then nice I got my check. Yeah. Are you upset? Are we going to the track Sunday? Are you going to crap out on the sun, Ed? Okay. We'll go next week one day. Ow, ran, tail. He's not going. See, I offered to get a nice box out there and be beautiful. But he's like he talks a good game. He doesn't want to go. Go ahead. Ellis, ran, tail. Has Rick Trast. Trashman. Yeah. Rick Trashman. Who I saw a few weeks ago, by the way. Did he do surfing bird? Yeah. Former Navy officer who blew the whistle on Dough and a view. That's the exciting allowshots. Now, how did I want some spy reports on his show with Jerry Butler? Yeah. How did that go? The ugly Harry Porno star. He's a little on who seems a little on the swissie side. Anyway, there's one more that I have a question about here in the radio highlight. And then, see him on a swissie side. Six thirty tonight. By the way, I want you to look at Jerry Lewis. See in this disc. Look at his, his lips and his chin. What was that? No, seriously. Does that have Jerry Lewis written all over it? Sure. He's got that Jerry Lewis such chin. And we apologize to him for that. He wasn't only traumatized in Vietnam. He was traumatized every time it looks in the mirror. And he thinks of his dad. And he brecks all over himself. Okay. Go ahead. Ellis, ran, tail. You know, there's just one I want to ask you about. I'm going to go through all of these. Six thirty tight on WJNO AM12. Oh, yeah. My favorite station Doug Young. Is doing a show? That's what it is. Oh, my God. Holy Toledo. He'd easily would say. Holy Toledo. Yeah. He's shocking. He's shocking. He's shocking. How that's an easy one. Okay. What? It's a tight one. Yeah, but anybody who can't talk up this time and a ring has got to be, has got to probably know Joseph Gacky. Who wants to buy? I don't dislike anybody in this sports department. I like him all. Oh, sure. Joseph. I mean, he just a little uptight and surly. But he's a good guy. Oh, good guy. In spite of those horrible things he said about this show, but we do the same thing every day. It is Friday. He didn't mention what we do on Fridays. That's what we do on Fridays. That's what we do on Fridays. Okay. And then he can say he rips me every Friday. We'll make it like a ritual. And Hank is just Hank is, you remember when he first came here and Steve was shooting with Hank and I said, I don't understand how anybody can feud with Hank because he's just a super guy. A super guy. Yeah. But he and Steve, like it's not just for make believe it's for really hate each other. Hate. You should have heard what Hank said about Steve. But when I was up at the track last Saturday, I can't repeat it on the air. But they hate each other. Yeah. And you should have heard what Steve said about Hank in here last Monday. But be side that. Well, that's good. And maybe we could get Hank with dusty roaches after and we could get that. Then you'd see some serious. Fisticuffs. Okay. Then you'd see some serious pounding into the ground as they say. Okay. The Palm Beach lines are very mellow. They're just kind of hanging loose. And we understand that. We did very well in the book and Palm Beach. So we're feeling we're feeling our oats as they say. Speaking of oats, we got Chinese food coming in. Hopefully very, very soon. Okay. What is it now? Did we miss some? Uh-oh. We only got like two. We made the sunset. No, two. Woo! The John Levitt Show. The blue baller show. It can drop today. Off with the secret men's. He's Steve came show. Yeah. We read this already. Already read this. Yeah. Cut it out. Sure. We said we made the show. You know that Sharon. He's an ozone provocateur. No question about it. Well, listen. We got Henry Burrow. No. We got Gilmout. So bright. Wow. We got a little variety here today. We got a lot of new news with some news promos right inside no doubt. And we'll come back at 1105 without number two. Steve with dusty roads. Not the wrestler but the baseball. I have to this afternoon. I'm not going to say anything. We're there. It's 1117 and W.I.O.D. And this is a special request from Johnny Darr. Wherever he is today. I will always think about you. Got you. Got you. He's been invited without you. Holly, while he do the law with it. He's done. Hahaha. I love you. God. Me for you. They're paying us to do this. Yeah. That's shocking. Ladies and gentlemen. Okay. That's a great record. I'm sure glad I found it. See, on some of these oldies collections is where you'll find some really good stuff. See, you won't find a CD of the new colony sixes hits because they didn't have any. I mean, this one. Well, I had that. But I mean, I don't think they had any other ones that I can think of. And rather than have some pain in the ass, pseudo intellectual call and we'll look it up in the head. Yeah. We had to go deeper. Things I'd like to say was a bigger head reached number 16. But I don't. I'm sure if I heard it. I'd remember it. But I don't. It doesn't get you wood. And I will always think about you. Number 22 was six week on a chart, five 1168. See, the reason I remember it is because 60 and 60 now were the two years I was in Kalamazoo at WTPS, which is now WBUK or some god for second country station. But that was great. I was the general manager of the program director. I pulled an air shift every day. And I used to type the logs. Yeah. Seriously. You production, too. And every night we used to drive to Detroit to go to the track. So I was kind of busy. Seriously, it was in a house. And when I went there, they were like up to their ears and dead. And it was kind of like, PBR. It didn't show in its own market. In other words, WLS, out of Chicago used to beat them in the book. Seriously. That was in Palm Beach. And then in the six months, we were number one in the market. In fact, I remember when I came in and we started playing all this music. That a lot of these people never heard including a lot of Moton. I said, oh, that'll never fly here. We don't have my black people in Kalamazoo. Well, first of all, black people don't listen to Moton. Anyway, that's white people's black music. Right? That's black people don't listen to Moton. I mean, some of them do. If they live like in the upper rent district, you know, they want to try to pretend to be white people, something like that. But black people, I got their own music, right? They listen to like the dead milkman. And stuff like that. Anyway, it's 20 past 11 at Wild. We have an open line in Boca, which is really shocking. 2789463, 278 Wild. We're just kind of killing some time until I think we got to call Dave Johnson. That was you. Got a lot of calls here, but I think they can wait. Let's see. One, two, uh. What was that? What was that? I know I did. Wow. Couldn't hear it on the ear. Anyway, it's 20 past 11. And the Hank Goldberg's going to sneak in on the Cancho this afternoon and Duke it out. Dusty Rhodes will save Steve from being pounded in the ground. They had to restrain Joe physically. Oh my God. I'm going to put this in its ring and show it on the ear. Because they might get apple plucked it. It's a high as Dave Johnson around. Dave is not around, but I can leave a message for him. Okay, Tom, we're on the ear. By the way, this is Neil Rogers at Wild in Miami. Uh-huh. And Dave was kind enough yesterday. He called me with the, uh, after the draw was for the post positions for the Derby. Uh-huh. And he left the number. And so I thought I'd give him a call. Or maybe he'd call us back on the ear, okay? When? Oh, any while we're on till two. Hi, many time. Oh, until two. Okay, give me your name again. Okay, Neil Rogers. Uh-huh. It's Wild in Miami. Uh-huh. So, Steve. Right. In fact, what I'll do is I'll put you on a hold and then my, uh, a board operator can give you our hotline number. So, Dave, you know, if he's got time, it's not a big deal. But I just thought we'd chat from a couple of minutes about the Derby. Okay. Hold on one second. I appreciate it. Uh-huh. Okay, that's on the bat line. Give her the, uh, bat line number. Maybe Dave can call us back. 21 past 11 at Wild. Well, we got all kinds of things. We got several something's going on. No way. Pembroke Pines. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? I'm running a little later. My clock is up. My long jeans with Tabrick Lock. Holly, Wally, due to law all the day. Yeah. Hey, Neil. I know you like a secure record. Do you have anything there, uh, by Gary Lewis on the playboy? Uh-huh. That's what we always like. Is a real comedian, you know? Hey, Neil. I like to make a request. Very maddalo, Braalas, and have the copa. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. That was nasty, sir. But of course, it does fit. It does fit. Neil. Listen to that. I didn't do a thing. It just kind of like started by itself again. Shocking. Uh, you got to admit, you like Gary Lewis in a playboy. You know, yeah. See, I could tell you sound like the kind of guy who, like Gary Lewis. The best show on South Florida Radio, pardon on Nick. Well, there is there any question about that? Oh, the show sucks. So what does that tell you about the rest of the show is pathetic? Neil, I think every one of you show up. In 25, we're in a market. Neil. What? Neil, you're not listening. That well. Well, it was neither anybody else. I don't know who you have to say. I mean, you tinkled all over. I was growing. You know, this one Tom Durkin called yesterday. He was saying tinkled? Yes, I know. I mean, here's the public address and answer at the metal lands. A legend in his own time. And he's saying, no, he's great. No, he's great. He and Dave Johnson, like, I don't want to go into it again, but they're both so good. I'm in awe of them. It's kind of awe inspiring. I haven't been a call of a day. Neil is as your listener, but you know, but you know, but. The thing you didn't write has been a real short call. Yeah, we've got to give me the gong, right? Yeah. Neil and 25 words are more of a separate callers call up and say, why I like the Neil Raju Show is. Oh, God. That's a kind of thing that Steve would do, okay? Oh, no. I don't do that kind of stuff. No, you need to see what happened. Call and say why they hate the cane show, okay? Which would kill four good hours. Neil, I've looked my best friend. Steve's Steve is, you know, he's had some problems. You're insecure, Neil. He's Steve is a kind of guy. Now that we're on the same station, we get along fine, but there's something about Steve. And I think this is what Hank does. Steve is a kind of guy. You enjoy ripping. I don't know what it is, but they're just something about Steve. I don't know what it is. But you know what it is? You know what it is? You know what it is? You know what it is with Steve Neil, the longer you look at him. You realize the man has a little or no. No, that's true. He's got some talent there somewhere. I don't know where it is. Now come on. Now see now you're being crazy. You guys out there find a little opening. You're right away. You assume we're inviting you to rip one of our colleagues. Glenn. Now what were you saying? What? I think it's time to rip one. Oh, have a nice day, sir. God. I mean that's getting really carried away. It's one thing to rip Steve because Steve can handle it. But when you rip somebody who just can't deal with it, and cope with it, it becomes hysterical and starts pacing the floor like the cubs were losing or something. Yeah, I actually got a good night's sleep last night. You know what? Because the game was early. It was a daytime game and ended six, twenty hour time and they won four nothing. And it was relatively painless. And Balakki pitched it went all the way. So to speak. And it was great. God it was good. No. No. I got my cubs cap on by the way. I've got my check now. So after we eat, I can go home. Because they're playing tonight on the west coast. They're playing LA for three, which means three consecutive losses. What? Hmm? Did you ever do the Zeta thing you were going to do? Are you telling that back? Okay, that's coming up. Ladies and gentlemen, we're holding it back. We're waiting for the audience to build. They want you to go to your telephone directory right now. Call everyone, you know, from four A assholes to whatever. Twenty five past eleven at WIOD. The only open line on the board is in Palm Beach, where we're just kicking, kicking something. Yeah. At six five five WIOD, we'll be right back. He's back. And he's stalking a psycho who wants to make the Chicago Cubs Pented Contenders. Clint Eastwood is dirty, hairy, hairy, hairy. How everybody is hairy, hairy, was Steve Stone and the f*** of your goodness beat all of them today. Clint Eastwood gives a whole of fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster. There's action. The pitch. Strike it to the f***. He's through that f***. All right, pass, Clark. Suspense. A f***, maybe it could be. It is a f***. No Ryan. Throwman. Oh, look at that f*** on that broad Steve. Only couch. Clint Eastwood is dirty, hairy, hairy, hairy. Coming to a theater near you. Now the best part of it is this was almost re-enacted live yesterday. And during the game, they came back at the end of a half inning. Early. And hairy didn't realize he was on yet. And they had this shot of these two very voluptuous young ladies. This is in San Diego in their bathing suits and some young guy with them. And he says to Steve, he says, see that one on a lefty. That's my kind of woman. And he didn't realize he had no idea he was on here. And then there was about a three-second pause. Harry, hairy, back at your house. He didn't even have no idea that it was on. He could have said anything. Yeah, he almost came close to that. Yeah. Anyway, it's 11 30 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward, 524WIOD, 5249463. The Palm Beach line is also open, but we don't care because now we're confident. Although now that I see this next call, our confidence may... What is this? We'll win. We'll win. What? What do you mean what is it? We'll only do the law all the day. All right. Are you coming up with Willie Nelson, too, to see... What's that? Who's that? Dusty Rhodes. Dusty Rhodes on the big Steve came to show. I can imagine it's a good one. Can you tell me what stands as high and thanks so much for not calling him? I was only saying that. No, I just made that up. I'm sure you did, because of course we're still very good buddies. All right. You know, life goes on, of course. How about DJ, DJ, don't come around since you can't get any more free meals, I understand. Anyway. Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Let's not try to call you the other day. I've had a very rough week. And I was trying to get through to you from a Yeeha junction. And I thought the bird could relate to that. Uh, Adam Brown. Yeah, he's from Lakeland, so he's seen a lot of Yeeha's in his time. Yeah, right. He should be a hooch. By the way, if anybody been on a turnpike lately outside of the immediate area, I mean, I know they increased the toll here a little bit. But when you go up state, like when you go to Orlando, it used to be four, somewhere that's like 755 now to go. They've like almost doubled the rates on the turnpike. But I can say I didn't have to pay anything because I had my vehicle. My brand new vehicle towed all the way from Yeeha junction down to the dealer that I bought the vehicle from. Ah, the strangest story ever towed. It was only a $440 dollar killing bill. You have had a rough week. We brought it right to the to the showroom door and set it there for a little while. That everybody take a look at it and it will ruin it. It's just a good heaven. And I didn't make a mistake. You know, I want to be patriotic. Oh, that's what I figured. They with a, they can't. It might not be as bad. Oh, it was that. It is. It is though. You know, I listened to all the way down from Mickey Land and that. I was up there on the business. I visited MGM studios. I don't want to hear about it because I got preempted from that. I had a freebie there last weekend. But he was the permanent here at some other ideas. What is the story? They sent a Michael there to do the show. I'm not talking about the show, but I had like a weekend and the hotel and everything. And they just they keep setting up all these remotes every. I don't mind doing a remote. So I enjoyed it. But I'd like to do it at a time that's convenient. In the course for me, I know that's shocking, but that would be nice. And then Lynn Friedass, what kind of you are the hardest person for dates on everybody? There's only two dates out of a whole year other than my vacation. And I, you know, didn't want to do one. And that's when she gets it, you know. Well, you know, so to speak. When you're, when you're a P on, you know, a really doesn't matter. It's right. Show so much weekend. Yeah. You know, bird, I went, I happened to go through, I had to go over to Tampa and San Piedam and go through Blakeland. Choose. On the way over to Orlando and yes, I saw the billboard, Blakeland home of the bird and this. What was it a bitter pill to swallow each day? I got a nice job. I went by, you know. I actually have billboard. It's kind of like, well, it's somebody holding the sign of, like, Holly, will he do to all the day? Exactly. He could have been your mother or something. I don't know if it's sign up for it. I doubt that. Yeah. But I was up at empty. I was discussing possibly a remake of one of my dad's movies again, starring you and they want to possibly do GI Blues. I'm on the verge of dropping a whole bunch of cards here. So if you don't, sorry. Don't take it personally. And I'm saying, I won't. Well, listen, it's yours been a lot of fun. I haven't got any idea of anything that you said, but it sure is usual as a remake of. Did you happen to see more of a public? No. I don't watch more of a public. Well, they had something on it. They ended his show to the net. I was watching the hotel room and I was at the last part of the show. You know, you usually goes out with one of these cute little teasers, whatever. They had a female impersonator of Madette. Now it struck me. Oh, Elvira. And it really did look like him. And I don't know what this woman is proud about, but it really did look like him right near the way. Well, I see your blow in the story. This supposed to be a big secret. But after the operation is when and he disappeared. You know, I was wondering about. Because it would have been too embarrassing. I was going to ask you could have been that he's coming out of the closet now after the after the big one. He's an ozone provacatur. Exactly. Well, listen, have a wonderful life. And the jury's really crazy. So I'm here in your voice again. What the hell was that? Doesn't that little bit loose? No, they're a little trumpy. Oh, there's a little thick there in this beginning. Well, this is for the guy who's so excited because he heard the fettie who's going to eat it. Yeah. So we don't have time to play it. 153 at WOD. Dale Murphy got a hit for the Braves yesterday. That's the big news. Dale's not hitting probably about 205. He's struggling. The struggling lady wants to call up. How are you doing? Well, what's your name? There's April. What is that mean? That shirt off that I like so much. She had this great shirt on this one. I don't start encouraging him. Okay, that's all we need. The foot will be here at one. Best of cane on Sunday. Look at, it says, slimy lawyer, milk hers. That's a terrible time. And segment two, inside Christian science. Another one of those pseudo religious shows. And while the best of meal, it says, the day after stand feels in on a cane show. Oh, what was that? I don't know. I'm sure this is good comment. And of course, we'll be out at Boats Arrestam, or from noon to three while that's on the ears. That ought to be really exciting. And we got all pizza, lots of spring and food tomorrow. We'll have those lawn jeans with 10 for water. And bathing beauties. Yeah. And maybe even Peter from U of Emblem. Sure. Do you realize that the universities are out? No. Yeah. Are they out already? Yeah. These kids today. They're out already. The first week in May, Khaled. And like BCC is finished. And all those basketball evening courses over there. And the wind surfing and heavy duty stuff like that. And the schools are basically, yeah, I mean college. Yeah, college, huh. What did they, and that didn't they just get back from spring break? Didn't they? There was this maniacs. Hollywood. Hello. The meds suck. You can say that again, pal. My amy. Hello. Now? Yeah. Hey, good afternoon. How you doing? Just great. I thought it was still morning. Yeah. I never realized Colin here could be such a detriment to your health. I got the part of wait. I just superglue the phone to my ear. Well, I'll be glad to put you back on hold. Oh, please. Please, Curia. I have a question. I'm almost afraid to hear the answer, too. That's not that strong. If you play occasionally. I want to die in Florida. Is that true? Is that true? Is that a real type that somebody tried to market? No. No. That's a bit. It's something. And you know who gave it to me? No, that's no idea. Ah, John Levin. Oh. Years ago, yeah. He wrote it. And of course, I can't think of anybody better suited to write it. No. That's a perfect bet, but it's recorded so well. It sounds like something. I mean, it's recorded so poorly to sound like something real. Well, I was done in somebody's basement. I got used to hang around a lot in basement. I thought I heard a toilet flush in the mirror. I get a little flush every time I hear it. I, yeah. In fact, we're getting our call from flushing in the next hours that all kind of fits together. That's flushing matters or flushing. Just plain flushing. Just plain flushing. Going down the tube again. Let me just call my girlfriend, Mia. A douchebag. Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia? Mia? Yeah. I hope she's listening. Okay. And the final question is done. By the way, your girlfriend had a little message for you. Holly, while he did a lawlet. I was, that was going to be my clothes in question. Does Holly want to do a lawlet? Well, only she knows, I guess you'll have to ask. It's better piece of work. Thank you very much. Oh, yeah. He really went through the rain drops and I felt it. I don't think he's life will ever quite be the same again. By the way, we saw those PBR numbers. And I think they're this song fits in. I can tell you something, I'm not sure. Look at in the red. I went to the day to world my friends. Would you stop me and say, oh, there's a lot of people around us. I'll feel that I could die. And I know, oh, yeah, that I was born and cry. Well, if I ever told you all about that. He should have been a canter. Really? And a synagogue. It kind of like tries. You know what I mean? There's some singers who would have been great at that. Like Chris Cross. It's 1157, a W.I. to of course a guy with the name like Cross. I might not work out. Miami, hello. I'm Neil. Yeah. I've already done. Great. Can't you hear Chris crossing in Hottickva? Go ahead, sir. Yeah. I've got a follow. Maybe you're going to help me. By the way, Mike Balecki, I said it was his first complete game. I was I'm getting carried away from that game. It was first shot out in the majors. It's third complete game. Go ahead. Me, are you listening? Yes. I've got a big problem. Sir, you don't understand. I'm much more concerned about the cubs than I am about your idiotic call. But go ahead. All right. That listen. What? Tell me if we will borrow. You know what? What? They're right. 1158 at W.I.O.D. Our Chinese feast will be here at one. According to the message on the old thing here. In New People. And after the new news, we're going to give our Zeta story. Whatever. Yes. We are Johnny. Yep. And dirty dancing is Jennifer Gray. Have broken off their eighth month engagement. One friend said it may have fizzled because he spends most of his time in Dan Covers shooting 21 Jump Street. And she lives in Hollywood. One but you know that. Keep good vibes. Don't get up. Bring the Don't get up. Don't get up. Bring the Don't get up. Bring the Don't get up. Bring the Don't get up. Whoa. Yeah. Well, last time I did this, you said it. You got it this time. Now you got it. You got it. Don't get up. Better. There's no way to do that with her. Because there's like gay. I don't know. It's hard to explain unless you understand talk up 102. Unless you've had some real intensive training and you just don't understand it. Yeah. Yeah. Most of you folks out there don't understand anything. We talk about anyway. Which is why the show is so successful. It's true. So well, that's going to do it for this hour. For the big 11 to 12 hour. We just kind of kicked it right in the pants. We have one open line in date 751 WIOD 7519463. All you really desperate pathetic guys out there. Any audience who turn on the radio to get excitement. April, were the Miss Danny, but I'm not saying that you got to be desperate to listen. April, because she's a wonderful human being. But I mean, I think you have some kind of a life wouldn't you? And we'll be back at 12.05. Steve with Dusty Rhodes, too. I'm a content. I don't know about that. And I trust you, I too. Okay. So if I just wear the cap in the t-shirt and I don't say anything about it. We'll let the all right. And be better. Okay. That would help. Oh, fine. I'm going to do that, but it's just to pacify you. Would that be alright? It's Friday. Now come on. All right. We won't talk about the cups. We've got every line lit on the board. When we feel like we'll take another call. Now you're going to do your Zeta. Sure. Is this going to be a rip? Yeah. Is this going to be a shot? Yes. Good. Good. Brutal. It's not going to be like calling Irene Richards a douchebag or something like that. Because she's not on Zeta. Right. But she still is a bitch. Oh. Not in this place. Ah. Ah. See, these guys have worked at the other. All these stations in the market. They carry these grudges. And they just, ah. And I'm not like me. I love all this. Oh, yeah. Like Tim Williams. I don't say anything bad about him because he's got young kids. I have no idea what that means. But the first day of the hearing calls up Bill Wise is, please don't let them rip me on here. Have young children. What the hell is that mean? Can't you be a douchebag and have young kids? Like I said yesterday, don't blame the kids for his incompetence. Right? Kids don't program that station. Okay. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I have never told this story. We told a lot of stories about what they did to us over Zeta. I never told this one story. And I would like to tell the entire world this story. Really? Well, we were shocked. We were at Zeta 4. In the spring of 1988, we were the number one morning show in South Florida. Every California category. Every category. The show was sold out. We accounted for 30% of their revenue. According to them, I would say probably 50% of the poor stations. They even did that. We accounted for 30% of the revenue. The show was sold out. We had big expensive national accounts. We were just, we were incredible. You mean, Sponsored Somebody was really paying for? On Zeta? That was unique. You mean, it wasn't the ad team for 15 bucks a pop? Come on. So, I understand they got a new gimmick over there. They're selling dollar or holler. They're bringing that back. Go ahead. Anyway, you know, there's little microphones that they used to have. What do they call those? Remember years ago? They had those little white microphones. Many, many years ago? Seriously? What do they call it? White? White? I think they called it. And that was like 50 cents a spotter. Something they would take up the whole station and just saturate it with spots. Okay. Go ahead. Sorry. Well, it's before your time. Anyway, I felt that I was underpaid for the job that we were doing. What job were you doing? What was your job description? Would you like to tell us what it was? I did the news. You did? And, yeah? Did the news? I mean, when you used to butcher all those words? Yes. I laughed. And I was the mortar between the bricks. Over there. I was the mortar between the bricks. The story was that. What a way of meeting on the earth. This is bad radio. I shouldn't be doing this. Because we got some hot shots in here from Atlanta. My job description was morning news. That's how it was described officially. Now, the last two guys that were in the world getting so carried away with yourself. Since they wrote that thing in Metro Magazine, it hasn't been the same. Nobody reads Metro Magazine. I never mentioned that. Nobody ever heard of Metro Magazine. To do you started talking about it? Go ahead. So anyway, Mike. The last two guys that were in the position of... One of your doing his story for Disney, because you said he was a douche dragon. I'm going to run like pretty interesting. The ones that were on the edge of a pig me. The last two guys in this position were as young as a matter of fact. Oh, yeah. I think it was the place. We're going to have some stuff on him. Who was that idiot that we threw out that was in that position when we went over to Zeta. There was some... What was his name? That guy who... In what position? Lawrence wanted to throw in you to do your news. And you said absolutely no way. And they kicked him out. And he's doing tennis. Now, what was that guy's name? Jeff Chase. Jeff Chase. Okay. Now, these were the last two guys. He told him a story. Now, I got to give all of them. They were paid X number of dollars. That's not what they paid me. They paid me so far under what they paid these last two guys. You mean this is the story? No. Oh, who got... These guys got like one ratings and we were number one. Okay. But the story does have to do with money. I just want to tell you that at this radio station we had a five, five. And this is not an anti-chef conger story. This is an anti-management story. You know, Sharon just wrote on the screen or the bird is being ponderous. This is the longest preface, even in Warren Peace. They didn't have a preface like this. This is a preface. This is the longest buildup. It'd better be damn good now. Oh, God. So you were underpaid. I appreciate it. They didn't speak to you. They hated this. Yeah. And hated all of this. So we're going... You've got to make now. Because even Phil Coston speaks to us now. Yeah. It only took six months, but now he's speaking to us. So we're really doing it now. Since the book came out, you notice? Only since the book came out. So, well, it's just that I felt very unappreciated and very underpaid. Now you used to yell at us. That's the story? No, no, no. The story is that Jeff Gons, who is still on midday, and had ones. The ratings in the 9 o'clock hour used to go from the high-fours to the 10 o'clock hour to the high ones. This man had no spots in his show. It was a vast wasteland. It was nothing. He had ratings in the one he was nothing. He's an orange-owned provocateur. Exactly. And they paid the story as they paid this man. Jeff Gonser. Double. What they paid me. That's what I want. Is this the story? That's what I want the whole world to know. Oh, gee. Well, Holly, while he did the law all the day. I want the whole world to know that because he used to cross my ads every day. Oh, tell Mike we're late for lunch. Disney's getting hysterical for lunch. Because that's what he does best. Is he those executive lunches? He does it like nobody exactly. Well, a little bit of that to Henry's probably waiting over there with something to watch it done. He wanted to hear that story. Okay, they're seeing you. And stay out of trouble. They both won't be a story. Okay, listen, it's 11 past noon. I apologize for this. No, it's all under all. I want everybody. Here we go. Hey, we had a guy from Atlanta. The new big guy. Whatever his name is, public. And he's standing here waiting for somebody to tell them. It is. But yeah, they can relate to that. Because he told me boy, we're really, you're bleeding us with this. We don't mind paying you, but his bird brain in there. I never forget when Gilbertson and just went on and on and on with that memo. He doesn't need some cackling in there at all. Geez. We could tell stories about that place forever. I just wanted to tell you. I think yesterday's memo that somebody intercepted somewhere, I think that spoke for it's not. I couldn't do that. Okay, we have an open line in day 7519463. We'll get to those calls. And I'll re again apologize. Profusely. Don't apologize. Are you nuts? I wanted them to know. Why did you just say, Gonzer, who's a note talent, nice guy, but with no talent, no audience, was making more money than I wanted to say. No, I wanted him to know how much. How much I had it more. I had it more. I had it out of make a big log. He's coming down on a lot of people listening. Didn't listen to it. In fact, we're not going to do that. You were getting paid to do this. They'd probably really be laughing. Okay. They'd go nuts. I wanted that out. I do apologize for taking up a few minutes. Okay. We'll only do the law with it. But I wanted that out. Thanks for letting me do have a break. I'm sorry that we don't have time to continue. I think that's the audience for their patience. I'm very much today. I do that. Very nice of you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I'll never tell it again. Play. Is that a promise? Is that a plate? I wanted to do that. Okay. I wanted it in public. I did. Leave me alone. Are you a screw? Oh, do you know your little... Are you a strike? Yeah. It's 12.13 at WIOD. We'll be right back. I think this kind of fits in with that story. Oh yeah. Finally got to a better history. This is what everybody turned. Well, like you know, I want to thank the audience for their... Street patients today. Yeah. They're allowed to do what they're doing. Anyway, this guy was standing up against the wall here. And I said, who are you? And he said, I'm my candidate. I'm a screw. I'm a screw. And I said, boy, you sure fit the role. I think that guy. What's this guy? They might cook for Atlanta. I don't know his name. Yeah. Another Irishman, man. They hire all Irishmen in this company. I don't want to start a thing. It's 12.18 at WIOD. Let's go to Davy. Hello. Hello. Yes. Yeah. I just call this guy the... Nobody goes for the race with. I go with his Sunday. What? Are you going to the race with Sunday? No. Not going to the race track. No. I thought I was going to... Well, I'm going to change their minds. Okay. That's okay. Next time. Okay. If the bird doesn't go with you. Thanks so much. I'll give you a whist thing. It's about as much chance, and my goal to attract with her, if there was a high going up, and hunting for Bella, like going to the plantation, okay. We have an open line in Broward. Why do you two forward WIOD? Lunch will be here in about 45 minutes in Boa. We're going to be starving by that. Yeah. God. I thought we don't appreciate it. But wow. One o'clock is pretty stinking late. You know what? A collar wants to know what CD are you... Am I using? Like they're all on one CD? Well, first of all, a one with a watershed of pale and lala. That's the GTR classics. 97 GTR classics, volume one. You know, it's hopped domestic. They are like, there's going to be a volume two. And another is some good stuff on it. Lala, give me some love and buy Spencer Davis. Magic carpet ride. Journey to the center of the mine and boy. Doots all right now by free. Come at the other hit. Rambling man. Oh, gee. I love that. Do you? Is that the station that hermen and McBeneron? Well, you know. Now the reason that I like this song is... I know why. Well, it was in the accesses. It was the scene where the priest, the young priest and the old priest, were sitting in the bar with Henry Burrell. And the young priest was saying, he was losing his faith and Henry said, shut up and keep drinking. I'm telling you, I'm living in the bed. I'm living in the bed. It was shocking. 20 past notes in WID. Something wrong in the building, though, because today everybody is so friendly. You notice that? Yes. Yeah. I don't know. It's called sucking around a little bit too much, okay. Oh, her. His girl bright said to me, she said, boy, your show is so great. We always have it on. We always listen to the newsroom. I mean, girls are very nice. They're all nice in the newsroom, okay. Is Andy gone, by the way? Vacation. Vacation? What was that all about that Roger was feeding us that crap about how Andy was leaving or something? He's not going anywhere, is he? He is? I didn't hear that. Okay, here comes the message now. See what we do these long-possils. He's not going. Andy will be... Yeah, he's gone somewhere. Gone. So, yeah. Well, like what? He may voluntarily? Yeah. He's leaving us voluntarily? Bigger and better. Not voluntarily. Not originally like to get into him out. Oh, God. Boy. Oh, oh, oh. He's not leaving us? Why the Strager? No, wait a minute. What is the story? What is the story? What is the story? God, I guess I shouldn't have said anything about this story. Right. Time for Roger to pay my report. Is this a secret? He doesn't know he's going to be gone? Oh. Oh. He's been... I said, squeezed out. Oh, oh. Why? He's a good guy. He's a great guy. He's a great guy. And we want Andy here now, okay? Get rid of some of these other pseudo intellectual dudes. I'm here to do anything, okay? They can't even describe their job description. They want a higher one. An anchor? I think they ought to tie an anchor to the whole building and take it out with a bay here for a while and clean it out. That's what they ought to do. That's true. They got a guy. They do want to. And he's getting squeezed out and we're pretty pissed off about it, okay? So call up every single day and just go nuts and say, we want Andy. Anyway, right? Sharon agrees too. Andy's one of the, they're like four or five same people in the whole building. And he's wonderful. That's true. Right? Sharon's another one. We're not. Well, she has her moments because she has to see Steve every day. She knows pretty well. Yeah. She hangs in there. But boy, there. She's a doctor from UofM. What the hell happened to him? He's gone out. Out. Yeah. That's because he looked too good to be in this building. 22 pass noted. W.O.D. West Palm Beach, hello. Hey. Yeah. I just want to say that, uh, bird. Yeah. You just respect for, uh, how's nothing else you're doing? Exactly. Okay. You scared me? What do you think? I just, uh, you know, you sat on the phone on the air. Wait a minute. Is this boom boom? He says you shot on the phone. I'm sorry. On the airways. I tell you what, sir. You know, when you have your own show. Are you Charlie now? You won't have your, uh, yeah. When you have your own show, sir, you won't have to put up with this. Okay. Will that make you feel better? No. Bird. All you to do is to laugh. Not just that there in waste 15 minutes of meal Rogers, Prover. Exactly. Okay. Say it again, sir. You are here to laugh. Okay. And that's it. Not to waste your Rogers program. Do you really? Okay. And waste our precious time, right? Okay. These very few moments that we have together each day. You're right. All you have to say was that you should back get the paid double that you get. And it was over. What did you do? You're all good. Make a lot of the phone on me because it was so burned. You're trying to hang up. I went to the bathroom. Shut my mind, go off. I'm not going to let him do it, sir. Get out of my board there now. Sit down. Where is that? Yeah. I can reach the young up on you, sir. He actually got out of the chair and he'm over here. I can repeat that. Not only is he taking up valuable airtime. Now he's interfering with the technical operation of the show. I think this calls for a two-minute suspension and 30 seconds without pay. Okay. We got an open line and a bower in Palm Beach, rather with an idiot just hung up. 655, Wiod. 655, 9463. By the way, here's a song for Alice. I hear Alice got a two-two. True. Is that the number? Yeah. I'm talking about it in the book. I'm talking about it. Kind of you. Where? Sorry, I missed that show yesterday. Totally forgotten about it. What was it about? It'll be a little bit more than me sperm who swam up for it. But we didn't have any reports on that. I wondered what is that tell you. Could be because nobody was listening. Well, anyway, Alice. I have nothing to do with Alice. I've done it. I've done it. I've done it. Yeah, you were. Well, you were. Well, that's so we can't wait to get to the punch line because you killed so much time with that boring story. 1225 at WIOD on a wonderful Friday. God, this is a great thing. Isn't it? Just everybody is still and feel constant with smiling and laughing at the hall. And oh, you'll never guess who was really tinkling all over downstairs when dinner was. Bam, bam, bam, bam. Time just can't control himself. Lin Freides came down and she was going on and on about how much building she's got off this show. She's making a fortune. And I slapped her real hard a couple of times and she smiled anyway. And I thought, boy, there's something really strange going on here. Really strange. They are sucking around big time in this joint. Yeah, I guess they must have seen those Palm Beach numbers. Okay, we got a mobile in Palm Beach, but we got a spot to do. What are we going to do here, sir, man? Well, I just wanted to call and say, I'm a vet. I really am. What? About bird taking up. 10 minutes. We have a break to here, don't we? Well, we're going to postpone it. Huh? It's a bad connection. I think I got it. I can't hear a thing the guy's saying. And you're all that static. We're late. Okay, you're a star, boy. You lucked out there. I want to complain about it. At least have a phone at work. Okay, that would be a good start. Talk on inside of we got them energy. And shells wants to make you crabby this weekend. The boats are in. In fact, people are jumping off it and letting the floor to lottery. And the boats are in from the first major harvest of a laskins snow crab. And the cats was one of the best in recent history. And shells serves a laskins snow crab clusters. So that you can enjoy the meaty crab shoulders. I love those shoulders. Not split legs that have been broken off the crab and lost their natural flavor. But large clusters, chocolate full of sweet juicy crab meat. Mmm. Mmm. Shells are serving pound and a half orders of a laskins snow crab clusters. And they're steaming hot to your table for only eight dollars and ninety five cents. I tell you one thing, it shows there's so much food that serves steaming hot. That some days you go in here, it looks like the. Uh, what's at place where the Loch Ness monster hangs out. It looks like London on a bad day. Okay, because it's so foggy, but the food is great. Humongous portions. And of course, incredibly low, dockside prices. It all five shells in South Florida. So make it a shells weekend this weekend. Right, have a real shell abrasion at any of the five South Florida locations. Including the one in Oakland Park just a quarter mile west of US one on Oakland Park Boulevard. Can you count us what CD this is that you're playing all this music. I'm where I'm here. I think we're not. That people are buying again. I mean, if it was one CD, we're playing all the stuff all over. It would have to be the size of Mount Ever. It'd have to be the size of our lean brushes. But I did not see anything in that intercepted memo of ours about our lean loss by the way, did you? Nothing. Do you know it got so bad over there that it got to the point they would didn't want us to mention Arlene Ross on the air? Hmm. That's a true stern. Hmm. Because they thought she would sue the company for sex discrimination for like, I mean, it was some, no matter what we talked about. Oh, you can't talk about that. Don't talk about this and don't die. Oh, gee, whatever you do don't mention this. Sure. At least one Gary Lawrence was there. He enjoyed it. He reveled in us ripping him. Hmm. And talking about him pulling him to the parking lot and what time it was. No, I'd stick we used to do with him. He didn't speak to us for a couple of months because he was getting canned. But at least he had somewhat of a good time with that. We ripped him on mercifully. Yeah, I believe. And he deserved it. Yeah, I believe. I have no idea. I have a good guy. And I think most everything he said about it. But he is a good guy. But compared to, you know, who? Compared to Tim Williams, he was like Albert Einstein. True. That's a true statement. That is saying a lot. That is shocking. Yes. And I kept telling people that they said, oh, no. I don't know. We're going to return to corner now. We're just really doing it. Little did they know that when they opened their eyes, they'd be on. I. 95. When is that starting? By the way, in about a week. It's 12.30. I want to WIOD for Lauderdale. Hello. Okay. Nice talking. Do you have a good weekend? Okay. Hello. See this says this makes up all that time. I can't believe that just because we had about 8 or 9 minutes in a water. It's about five. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes. Hi. Let me say it again. Hi. Hey, listen. Yes. I'm calling from Century Village. And I wanted to know that we like you. No. Really? Come on. Even though, you think we're kind of old. I never said that. I don't know all the people live over there. We have a few people under 90. I don't know. What we do? Well, that's good. But I want you to know that we love you here. Some of us anyway. Hmm. And one more thing I wanted to say. I bet you talk about the show in a whisper, though, don't you? Ha ha ha ha ha. Yeah. Yeah. I think we caught you. Yeah. We don't just walk around in the halls. There's a, they're Rogers Showman. They might come after you, you know. I just want to say something for them. They might breath on your doorway or something. I want to say something for found. Yeah. I don't know. Where's the beef? That's it. Well, let me say something for found to you, okay? Yeah, I go Hollywood do the love. Have a nice weekend now. You too. And happy she was. Thank you, Bob. Okay. Well, 33 at Wild. Where's the beef? The last one that said that was Mondale. Look what happened to him. Oh, come in years ago. Well, five. It seems like only yesterday. Yeah. The water was winning Minnesota. Clara Peller comes to mind. Mm-hmm. Interesting. Where's the beef? We still remember Clara Peller. He died by the way. Yes. I think she ate too many of them. Yes. Twenty seven till one at WID. Actually Clara Peller was only about twenty seven, but if you need enough, and that one joint man, it'll do it. Anyway, speaking of excitement, a week from Sunday, boy, it's like creeping up on it.

I haven't been lately. Yeah. That's he for you to say. You're all right. You're okay. You just carry the way. I just want to stick up for Glenn. Like I said. He never asks for anything. He always supports you. He always laughs. What is this like sympathy thing? Here he does just fine. Okay. He's laughing all the way to the bank. Okay. He's making more money than God for doing almost nothing. He's having a wonderful time. Well, it couldn't he like take five minutes. He works like three weeks a year when I go on vacation. The rest of the time he comes in and he's lunch, which is fine. Well, that's what I wanted to add. I don't do much either. So don't worry about it. But you know that lady who calls in and says to Mike Reneri, could she come in and butter his mother? Yeah. Well, when you're on the meal, that's the noise, by the way. Sit on anybody panic. When you're on vacation, if I could come in and sit in with Glenn. No, no, you can't come in. I didn't like with Glenn. I did. He don't just curse. Okay. You ought to call John Shuddlik. But I could he don't just curse. He pops his stuff as tortillas. But you've been here before having you. No, just not one day to pick up the dinner. Look at this. Here's the letter from Dot in Key Largo. Thanks a lot. Dot. Nice letter. I really appreciate your. I'm not paying any attention to what you said. What you said. Neil, did you know Kevin Elster got kicked out of the game last night? Did he? Yeah. Wow. He was already out. He went back to the dugout. And after the last guy got struck out, he went and argued with the umpire. He got kicked out. And then David Johnson got kicked out. Well, I'll tell you what was that. A little short there in a microad, I think. Give this to the bird. I don't understand this. This is a, um, didn't make any sense. Oh, look at this. Oh, my god. Not a little bit. You're feeling bad for him. Yes. When he sees what I just opened up in the mail. You know how on your plane ticket. There's a little thing that you tear off on the end that you keep the boarding pass. Right. I want you. This is from Atlanta to Washington National. The date is April 22nd. I want you to look at the name on that ticket. Holy God. Oh, my. Yes. Phoebe. Yes. I swear to God. A boarding pass. Yeah. Phoebe. Oh, my god. Oh, this will go so great in the shrine. I have it home. Wow. It's been a good ride into the shrine. You can put that right next to the shrine. You can put that right next to the river of Phoenix post. Okay. Listen, have a wonderful day. We'll talk you like what day is it today? How about Monday? Yeah. Like I said, we'll talk you about a weekend. We're so good. See you. Perfect. Time to call. Oh, God. 1244 WID before we open Donna's in temperate Cardan has been really on our best behavior lately. I think this person has a really nice. Thanks to the person who sent him the Phoebe cage thing. Oh, you know, I'm says he's already a licking it and doing this. Disgusting things with it. In fact, the word is saying something about John Schuddler. I'm wearing God. Same to the gift. Okay, Donna's one of the few people that gets musical accompaniment when we open up for a man. It's another card. It's another card. Oh, my God. This one goes on and on and on and on. Best beyond obsession. Wow. Where are you getting your stupid info? I was on hold on the Palm Beach line for seven minutes. During that time, a female called named Tricksie or Dixie. You hung up saying that was madamex. He used to call to be up above. I didn't remember any madamex. And then you took my call. And obviously thought I was that other caller. Roger put me on hold. I'm now sorry. I didn't have to tell him I was Donna. Then you'd realize I couldn't be on two lines at the same time. I've never called in using any voice on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. I didn't bother to go to, oh, there's the Chinese food. I didn't bother to go to Toyota because your new caller sounded like idiots with little to say just like you and Glenn. Don't flatter your huge ego to think I'm listening on busy and bored with your show. Yeah, you know, this road has got such problems. I mean, didn't I haven't always said like one day we're going on with her like two weeks and get all these. She'd tickling and just and then all of a sudden if someone little thing happened. It's right away we're idiots and she didn't let you in a shot. We're doing a bag. And then like on Monday we'll get a car. She loves us. Boy, Donna, you are serious. Serious. You know what I mean? Serious. Boy, she is not a well-chong. All right, I'm going to do our little message here for Toyota Hollywood after openness. Next thing here. Wait a minute.
