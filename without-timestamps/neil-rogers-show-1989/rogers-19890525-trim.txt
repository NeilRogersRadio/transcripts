I'm a co-brand, I know but man, but I trust you are true. Oh hey! Oh, where back? Might be out of here! Hey! Hey! He's dead! He's given again! Hey! I'm alive! Black David's side! Holy cow! Yeah, what is that? Is that on the tape? I like that he saves time because he's not a set. I know, notice that there's two things that want. Well, it's not as good as that sports sanctuality that Joe played on the 10 of sports here. That was really good. I don't get hysterical, Joe. It's just a ball game, okay? 10-06 at WIOD. It's a Thursday and I'm curious, is today like payday for everybody? Boy, you're low down in your chair. I told you this, Joe, is on the floor. God, you're so low. Yeah. Well, I wanted to bring me back down to earth. Numbers came out, we went up again a little bit. They just tried to bring me back to earth. I don't know if we're going to get paid day in. I heard some rumbling about it over here. Because nobody's going to be here tomorrow, are they? Because we're not there. We're not there. We're not there. If we have a whole bunch of people tomorrow. Now today we got the natural eats. It's bringing food in the course of fat ridges here every Thursday. So just by coincidence, he happens to be here. That's good. I'm curious what this is. Hi, ladies and gentlemen. I'm ready to broadcast. I love myself. I'm so excited. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the Colonel. Isn't it? Yeah, yeah. Oh, Ricky, tickle. Oh, no. Oh, no. Looking for a peanut one. It's a piece of pieces. I wonder he's related to the Boko Puker at all. Thanks so. What happened to the thing we got yesterday that new card? The thing. Well, that better be in here. I'm going to be crazy. Oh, we try to find something in here, man. It's looking like looking for a haystack in a needle. The one from Mitch. Yeah. What's it called? It's called just exactly what it says. Now, that card better be in here. And it better be here quick. Nice reading, by the way, from Mitch. The greatest. You could tell there was a lot behind this. Oh, boy. There we go. Very some here. Here we go. Haven't even started the show yet. Oh, here it is. Thank God. Boy, my heart is just bitter, panter. Is it real at a woodmitter? Yeah. Sales, people are rassels. Yeah. Okay, it's too late to do the job. What? It goes without saying. Okay. Now, we got a couple of things here. First of all, our horses are still running from yesterday. Oh, God. And you know, you can't win them all. We're going through a cold streak. You know, kind of like the Yankees. Oh. So, how are we getting going? There's some good stuff. We're going through that. Okay. Now, we're going through that. Okay, okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, I'm not taking any chance. That's my pick. I gave you a chance at a wrist a credit cross today. And you pasted up. I don't want to go with, you buy past a lock. Yeah. That's correct. And that's the touch and feet in the feature in the ninth race with Jose Rivera. I like it. Where's that jungle Jim Rivera? It's one of the other. That jungle. Yeah. Chuck Mune. Jim. Also, here's a little blurred from the paper, a scuffle with political prisoner, Roberto Martin Perez has caused Spanish language radio commentator for Lepe Rivera's job. What? Another one of Steve's buddies. Philippe? What do you want, sir? Yeah. Yeah. I get a horse for you. Yeah. Soky Roman in the fifth. I love you. Soky Roman. A horse is 12 to one in the morning while. And he's tips. These hot sticks. Hey. Thank you. Good luck to you. Good news, Björs. Silky Roman with the hero Bertocastio. 12 to one. Does anybody pick it? No. How about a former vision is, Steve is best better the day. We're not picking any more horses out of the sun, central to like it. To like it, somebody making the great line, a little who's got some clue what's going on over there. That's why we get screwed half the time. We pick out of the sun, central. They got horses like 4 to 1 and 5 to 1 and Phil looks in a program. Like 800 to 1 and 5 to 2. It's true. Anyway, Rivera will commentator on Radio Swave was fired after advertisers and listeners complaining about his run in with Martin Perez. Yeah, he's a wonderful guy that Philippe Rivera was in it. It's said he also had a talk show from 5 to 7pm called the firing a flagrant attack on a freedom of speech. Now he's a great one to be talking about freedom of speech. Okay. So worst douchebags in a history of this town, how he's ever been allowed to be on a year beats a hell out of me, but I'm sure Steve will have him on real soon. Oh, he will. Oh, guaranteed. Steve loves him. Steve loves every douchebag that ever came down to Pikey's obsessed with. Steve has open phones today, which is good because at least we get through one more day without a rabbi. How was my or Kahana yesterday? I can't hear him. Was he still hot in a trinic? I didn't hear why. I can't control the rabbi. Was he hot in a trinic about the Arabs and Jews again? I can't do it. I get the feeling when I listen to him that like the Arabs and Jews don't like each other too well. What did you get that feeling? Which is quite a revelation. That's something really brand new. Anyways, 10 minutes past 10 at WIOD. We may or may not be getting paid today. I just mentioned that in passing because if I'm getting paid then it's going to require, you know, at least three or four people to drag the check-up stir. But we'll see. I just think tomorrow's going to be skeleton crew. Yeah. And then Monday, of course, nobody will be here. But Mr. Arnold's coming by with those royal cancel burgers on Monday. Amazing. And total be here on Monday. So I know you're happy about that. Anyway, I don't know what your problem is. Really, I think we need to examine this. I look at that. Every line on the board is lit. Problem about what? Every line on the board is lit. What the hell did we do? Is there something going on? Man, the traffic this morning was brutal. And you know what it was? It was jammed up on 95. And then I get to like, hell and they'll be full of art. Somewhere around there. And there were a couple of those. What do they call those orange pickers? Those big things where the guys are up in a sky and they're doing something with the lines. And once you get by there, there was no traffic at all. Now they weren't in a road. They were like, I'm a side of the road. But that had traffic just looking, gawking at those idiots, had traffic backed up about five miles. You people out there who think you're driving. Man, you couldn't drive your finger up your nostril. Or wherever. They have no clue how to drive in this time. The slightest little distraction, man. And you had about a five mile traffic jam. Apparently these people's lines are so empty. Oh, so little going on in their lives. That there's the lethal thing happens on the road. So not to make nature. You made you in their line. Anyway, 12 minutes. You had to be kidding me. Dwight Lodderdale. OK. Well, it's a good thing she didn't name a man bishop. Anyway, that's just a little thing in a Harold. It's not worth repeating. But of course, Sharon is scouring the papers trying to find something for Steve to talk. It's 1015 to W. Iudey. Sonny is up in Gainesville, by the way. So even though you're not going to hear the hurricane game, we'll be getting reports throughout the show. The game starts 1130. And we'll keep on the edge of our seats. Oh, Rufus, what do you want, Rufus? Hey, Rufus. How you doing Neil? No, this is Neil Rufus. Yeah, I know. But I'm trying to get a hold of three, four days. What do you want? You don't need to talk to you through doing great. Yeah, I know that. I'll be seeing all the games, Rufus. Everybody's talking. How about that, Greg Maddox, Rufus? Yeah. Yeah. He's OK in my book. Yeah, a lot. OK. You've been pitcher too. Yeah. Big weekend up here. And one major problem. Big weekend is we're going to have the cherry pie and catfish festival Saturday. Great. OK. Big ballers. You know, but I don't think you can't least leave the Roy. Look at that girl out there. You're going to build the fish fishing. Yeah. Well, I'll leave Roy in $1,000 on a scratch-off ticket and a lottery. And what are these scratch-in-Rufus? I don't know. But he had a showman also on Sunday, Silent. A showman. Yeah, that's good. He made some money. Yeah, sure. OK. And the other hand, he took Isabelle. That was that woman that came up to build the fish fishing and ran off with her. And now his wife just came home last night. And we don't know her ears. Could you please tell him? Because he misses the all the time. Tell me, right, it come to hell, huh? OK. Come on. Whatever you say, Rufus. Please, Nick. Whatever you say, have a great life. OK. It's 10 17 and WI of D. Boy, I was feeling so good to write up until I'm home at OK. We have an open line in date, what in Palm Beach. I haven't given the numbers out yet. So I don't know what I'm hooking and open lines. Now, what is this problem that you've got? Probably bloom. By you sure that's the right way. Well, I think it's definitely the right word. It's, so this is Staria. It's Staria. But these news interns that come in here and they don't sit on my lap. They don't, in fact, they don't even come over this half of the table. They don't come on this side of the table. And yet you have this hysteria, this obsession, this obsession will hatred. No. And tonight, I have, I don't paranoia. No. Insecurity. Costility. I haven't said one word to them of any time. I have no boys running around the news room interns. I don't even notice. Wait a minute. Are they boys, kids, kids? What are they kids? She's not a boy. I'm talking about male interns running around the news room. female interns. I haven't seen any. Well, there are two. I haven't seen them. I think newsroom is terribly unbalanced because it's all here on balance. Okay. About what? About this subject. My, okay, here's now he's ripping Dorothy because she has good taste. Okay. I didn't say anything about that. Isn't April and Gail enough for you to squeeze and fondle and molest. And then you're a Sharon who comes in here and scratches your back. And I don't talk about it. It's a little bit. I just thought, what I want to say. You don't want? I don't talk about them inlessly. I'm not a person. Endlessly? What I want to say about the male. What do you mean just now? Boy, is he getting defensive or what? Interned in this building. And then I have no opinion one way or the other. What does that mean? They have not struck me at all. One way. They haven't struck you. Well, one of them is going to strike you when he comes in today. Ross and probably beat you over the head if you don't stop. Stop. What? I have no opinion. Well, I do. One way. Well, we're not talking about you. We're talking about you. I thought you were asking me. Not at all. Good. Because I have no opinion. It's 1019 at WIOD and he has no opinion folks. Sports talk tonight. Correct. Goldberg with Kenny Noe of Calder. By the way, Calder opens on Monday. Wonder what happened to my Calder passes. 28th. It opens. No. In 29. I don't want a nitpick. But Sunday is a 28th. Last day at Highly with free admission at Highly. So all the. Goldish Norris will be out there on Sunday. And a Calder opens on Monday with a big Memorial Day card. I would assume. Right? Great. I like Calder. I do. I really like Calder. I do. I love going to Calder. What's funny about it? I don't know. It's just the way you said it. There was just something about it like. I don't know. I want to remember that wonderful breakfast we had a Calder with Gary Lawrence. That wasn't at Calder. That was at the Hall of the In Calder. That wasn't the. Well, overlooking the track, but that wasn't being in the track. Yeah, that was our ratings breakfast. Yeah. Our power breakfast for the rating. That's what it was. And boy, that was quite a reward sitting there at 10 o'clock in the morning. 30 in morning watching the horses, the remaining horses work out. And listening to Gary BS, you know. It was great. Well, they're really getting theirs over there. I'll tell you that. In fact, there's a big article here. A minority hiring gets scrutiny at 102 Florida radio stations. And it says the FCC is investigating the hiring practices of 102 Florida radio stations as a result of allegations by black civil rights groups of inadequate minority recruitment. And it has a list of the South Florida stations among the 52 in the state, which are in the list. That's OK. You can choke them. And among the list of WINZ, WNWS and WZTA. Wow, that's interesting. Gary Lawrence. Yeah. Hmm. 21 pass at 10 to WIOD. We have an open line in Palm Beach. You also have a wonderful memo here from Bill Mullin. And I want to thank him so much. He signs it all the best. And I couldn't come up with words to describe my feelings about the sales people I ran. So what was that? 21 after the hour, Charha had opened the doors in nine minutes and speaking of Bill Mullin. I want to, I just want to get this straight now. And I was going to want to be confusion. The hot dog special at Charha at the, um, where is it? County line really? County line store only. OK. Thank you so much. Well, I'm confused because Mullin is, uh, well, I'm going to slip. It's a paper. I got two, three more in there. After 4 p.m on weekdays and all day Saturday and Sunday at the County line location only hot dogs, 50 cents till the end of the month. You got another week to go in there and really pick out. OK. But again, after 4 p.m weekdays, all day on Saturday and Sunday. And of course, at all seven south Florida, Charha locations, you'll discover it. There's the only fast food place where they use Kaiser rules with the Poppy seeds. Or you can get the regular rule if you're some kind of a slumber. And they grind that Chuck fresh every day using only the very finest ground Chuck. They grind their pork butts every day. You might say they work their butts off every day to bring it that great Italian sausage. And 25 at WIW did we get a Mr. Food Spirey pork. Neil. Yeah. How you doing, buddy? OK, pal. Listen, I heard you talking about Mr. Food. So I figured I'd give you a little Spirey pork on the guy. I used to work at a certain country club in Boca. The guy used to come in and they'll play a little golf in here to do. And then they all mopped the bar for the free or dirt. And after noon. I guess I watched this guy coming in maybe two or three times a month. And I figured, you know, Mr. Food, Mr. Connoisseur, you know, I'll cook this. Cook that. He would never break down and spend a buck. They would or something off the bat. You always had to beat him for the free or dirt. And as soon as they were gone, he was gone too. Mm-hmm. OK. Well, I thought maybe there was more, but that's a good start. What he looks like, Mr. Schmutz, I think, should be his new name. That's what he looks like. That's what he looks like, man. That was a real idiot. He's got here growing off the outside of his nostrils. That guy, that's how bad he looks. Seriously. Mr. Appaphyde, how you doing over there, bird? OK. All right, man. See, that's about it. OK. Thank you. Quite a spiraport. Yeah. 1026 in WID, what I was no roof is from wherever that was. Boy, I guess Atlanta. No. He's from the Ho-Hook or somewhere up there. Hope in line is in Boca, 278 WID, and of course, Palm Beach, we're saving for the people out of town. If you're listening, like in San Francisco or in Phoenix, or in Albuquerque, line eight is open and available right now. Or into Bahamas. Everybody keeps telling me that everywhere they go into Bahamas, they've got us on like in the stories, on the radio. So we want to wish you a real happy rip off day to all our friends in a Bahamas, OK? Because we know they love ripping off American dollars. And good luck to you, OK? As long as they're too stupid in this state to have gambling, you folks are going to continue doing very well. Sure. And we don't hold it against you. If we were in your shoes, we'd rip off the dumb Americans, too, OK? Hot 105. This is from the dining and enter table. This is the Thursday paper. Oh, the Thursday paper. Oh, don't you remember we got the one last week? Yeah. This is the book. We just got a new trend, but this is the book. Oh, Beach. Wow. Dining and enter payment. The Thursday paper. What does the Thursday paper? What does that mean? What, don't you find that a strange name for a paper? Yeah. The Thursday paper, although it does come out on Thursday. So I guess it's OK. The top 40. This is Robin Plick again. Again, not Robin Plack, the Jockey, but Robin Plick. The top 40 radio format proved to be a hot commodity in South Florida and WHQT proved to be the hot property. The Miami-Based Station, which bills itself as Hot 105, received a lion's share of listeners. Look at this. They've even got a whole list of all the stations here from the book, which is only a month old. It's pretty came out today, May 25th. So they're right on top of things, OK? Then it has a paragraph where it says, Power of Speech. WIOD continues to improve its audience share after requiring controversial tacos Near Rogers last fall. Rogers, Micronary and Steve Cain, former popular lineup that blended with the station's evening sports programming to generate a 5-1 share. WS News placed more than a full point behind with a 3-2 share, while I'll news WIOD is a close third with a 3-1 close to what? Close to WIOD, not close to us. WG and O, will air a 9-minute segment of CBS Radio is the world tonight at 6pm. Program directed John Fakaro said the move was an experiment that has run its course. And if you mention any other station in his article, I'm going to retract my hand. Or he is such a paranoid douchebag. I'll only show up if no other stations invited. Wow. The big J-N-O, OK? Here's a multiple caller on four. Hello. Hi, how you doing? OK. We're sitting here listening to your show, enjoying it as we always do. We all love it. We work for a government agency, so you're the only sanity that we have during the day. Government agency, boy, we're being monitored by the government ladies and gentlemen look out. But no, we enjoy listening to your show. Well, that's great. And we haven't heard to talk about the video we were treated to the other day with Roblo. That we all got to enjoy during our dinner time. I didn't see it. You haven't heard us talk about the Roblo thing? Yeah. We've talked about it till I flew in the face. I mean, too much. OK. We must have been working during that time. Well, that's good. It's glad to know that on a government money you're taking a little bit of it. You know, time to do some work. But no, we enjoy your show. And we got a couple of other people here that want to talk to you. OK. Well, that's great. OK, hold on. You bet. Great. Wow. I think there'll be a success. I hope not. Hold it. Hello. Hello. Yeah. That's a good word. It's an excellent addition to your show. Great. And we think he does a fantastic job along with you. And if it wasn't for your show, we'd all be going nuts by this apartment a day. Right. OK. All right. Have a great life, pal. Hey, you, too. OK. Bye. Oh, man. That's the government for you right there, ladies and gentlemen. What a call. Some dub. What a call. Well, that's your crowd. That's your fan club right there. I get the answer. That's all. Did you give you a big compliment there? Oh, now we got veggie on a vocal line. Don't you understand? We don't want to talk to you anymore. Wait, I don't understand. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 1031 a WIOD. We have an open line in Brower. It's 5249464. You should've let him finish that one word. What was it? I don't understand. Yeah. Understand. 524WIOD. And Brower did Palm Beach. Forget it. I thought we were really going to be smoking today in Palm Beach because we started out. And every line was lit. We didn't even give the numbers up. And I thought they had something to say. And if you noticed, I'm wrong. That's nothing to say. Nothing to say. In fact, these are some of the most terminal people. It almost makes you want to punch your bokeh again. Oh, nope. Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 1031, I don't give up, veg. What come back here, we know then? You know, he usually does hang up. That's one of the reasons he pisses me off something fierce is we try to get him on in spite of his chronicness. And he just hangs up. If you don't get to him right away, like goes off in salts and drops the phone on the floor or some stupid thing like that, right? Yeah. Yeah. At least he's starting to get honest. OK, I liked that. That's a good pressure approach. Honesty may save you. I wouldn't count on him. But it might save you. It's 1032 at WIOD. And by the way, Fernando, I'm sure is driving up right now with a food from natural elites, which is just tremendous. And it's not that we don't like you, Fernando, but just drop it under the door. Ha, ha, ha. You're a wonderful guy. But don't please. Don't come any here for another four-hour, schmoozing around and just the thing. Well, he can't work. He can't stand. Exactly. They're doing a little business down there exactly. So he's got a lot of stuff to do. So we understand if you can only leave it at the front desk. And we remember what you look like, which is one of the reasons we don't want you in here. 1032 at WIOD. Do you want to eat it? Can't all look like Ross and Todd, despite of the fact that you hate them. Don't say that. And Jared, what do women really want you to do? You let my and Kihanna kidnap Jared yesterday and took him to Israel. Not he saw him wearing that higher on his neck. What do women really want in men? Not the sensitive carrying Allen all the types that were in Bogg. And I said, man, we got enough Goi and hear already. You can't take the Jews out of the building. Nowadays, gals are looking for handsome rich guys in the mold of Donald Trump, according to the way ladies talk by man watchers and won't go in off at 40 to 1 at Hailea. So Steve's listeners was as usual or full of it. So he had to give Hank another 20. Good. So it's 120 that he pied away. What is what have burned it? I'm sorry, go ahead. Today's ambitious women want the superficial things. Good looks and the success quota according to man watchers. They must have interviewed Laura for this. Okay, because she's given up all that other stuff. Now here are their figures. He's given up on Scott. Here are their, as the good looks he don't have. You might exactly hear the, exactly. Very good. Here are the top boat getters. Mel Gibson. For what? Man watchers ain't come on. Will you stop it? Are we going to go through the same old list again of all these schmutzie guys? Probably not the same. Pack your swazis on it. No, crazy. Swazie is naked. Swazie is naked. How about John Cameron's swazin? No. John F. Kennedy Jr. Man. Lou Gossett Jr. You know, if he wasn't John F. Kennedy Jr. wasn't his name. Nobody would pay attention to him. Okay. Look, John's a junior. Yeah. Why is that? Because he was in that movie with Jason Getrick. Obviously. And Donald Trump. Oh, give me a break. Will you? Looks money power, they say. And Paul Newman. Also making the list. Most watched, most watched men. Oh, put on your seatbelt. Alan thick. Oh, God. Get serious. And the rat pack actor Andrew McCarthy, who I hung out with in Atlanta. Yeah, you hung out with him and Roblo. Tony Danza. Yeah. What's Roblo? Tony Curtis. Yeah. And Kenny Rodger. Wasn't that Jamie Lee Curtis's father? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, now I'm beginning to put all of that together. But her problems. Okay. The fact that she had a pace those on. And that she seemed so butchallotime. Tony Curtis is her father. What do you think about that, bitch? Wonderful. That's 35 at WIOD. And I want to mention, of course, that locked everyone at a as you know, one of the great Italian restaurants anywhere in the world. It's not just Florida's finest Italian restaurant. It's so good. I don't think you can beat it anywhere. And they bake everything fresh on the premises. All their great postes are all homemade. That angel hair pasta with whatever you like on it. You can get it with baby cow or with seafood or we're just about anything. You can just get it like with sauce, you know. And all kinds of great wheel dishes and poultry. They're very finest in Italian cuisine. I do want to mention that a lot of tethernet will be closed this Saturday and Sunday because chef Romano and his lovely wife Carol will be attending the graduation of their daughter from college. Well, congratulations. Of course. And of course, they're normally closed Mondays and Tuesdays anyway. So they're going to take like a little busman's holiday for this and it's well dessert. They'll reopen on Wednesday. The survey would lock tethernetta. As a matter of fact, I'm just thinking about it. And I think next week one night I'm going to lock tethernetta for dinner. I just, yeah, what's been a long time. You know, that's it has. And now that I'm just kind of floating in my way, it's just hovering about the same. So for the very finest in Italian cuisine, you had for a lot of tethernetta. Be sure make reservations. 7221831. You'll find them on McNebro just east of Pine Island, just north of commercial. 84. 55 West McNebran, Tamarack, lock tethernetta. He's good. Well, like I said, no, I don't think he's a pah. He is a pah. Because I said something to him about this the other day again. And they won't play it on GTR. OK. No one. Now they wouldn't play the Raiorvison record, which was number one, A.O.R. Not just number one like Billboard, but number one, A.O.R. Now, they're rocking the country. They wouldn't play it on GTR. They won't play the D on, which even Y.N.F. and Tampa. That's right. See, that's the problem with this market. There is no real A.O.R. station. What you've got our stations, you've got three stations pertaining to B.A.O.R. that don't want to be. In other words, they want to be safe. All right, Miami. I say it at which plays all the same six groups that rose, fold your legs over and over again, the stones and the Beatles. And for example, like Billy Joel, I hate Billy Joel. I know I've told the story before, but I said to Rose, when we were over there, I said, how can you be an A.O.R. station and not play Billy Joel? He doesn't like him. He doesn't like him. OK. So he's not going to play Billy Joel. He evidently doesn't like Dion. And of course, it's she. Got to know is what they're playing. And here's GTR over here next door. And they don't have any balls over there. OK, they play the same safe stuff, the same groups over and over again, including groups that I like, but I don't want to hear four in her all day. OK. Right? It's the... Do you? No, it's the tested, say. Yeah, tried and true safe. So there's no station in this market where you're ready to get a chance. It's really some commentary that this, which is a hot album already, by the way. And getting a lot of play on A.O.R. stations. The only place you'll hear it in this market is on this show on an AM station. I wasn't that's, and isn't even a music show. What do you think of that? Unbelievable. Yeah. That's shocking. So just for the record, spike wise, you're a putts. And when you keep looking at those trends, you need to keep seeing that little yo-yo up and down and down and up a little bit. See, they get a fluke once every three or four months and then they go up and they get all excited. Then they come back to where they really belong. They should be dominating, because Zeta's like, you know, five minutes away at any given moment from being off the air. OK. She is like, they made a little bit of a comeback. Or somebody gave him some oxygen. I think by default. But the guy only knows what the hell they're doing. So they ought to be running away with it. They ought to dominate. OK. And they don't. Because their music sucks. Focus groups. Cradable. Unbelievable. I wish I had in the bank the money. OK. Station's like these. These two here in this building waste. Ah, on focus groups and all these other funny, baloney studies. You can't program music on focus groups. OK. And over it's Zeta. Did you notice they used to do that all the time? All stations. Yeah, down here. Same thing. And you can't do that. It doesn't work. I mean, if it worked, how can you be doing a one-share? And you keep doing the same thing month after month with focus groups. Oh, yeah. They react real positive. It's like in commercials, they react. They get these people in a room. They hope them up to their like-light detectors. They detect all their emotions. And then they sweat or puke or anything even close to that. And then they get the reaction of it. Because they're spending a lot of money to make those commercials. And they want to know how the public is going to react. Yeah. Well, it's the same thing with the focus groups on this music. And they get like 14 drugs that they got down at you, totem somewhere. And they bring them in a room and they sit them down. They put the music on. And half of them are stoned out of their mind. They can't understand what the music is. Anyway, oh yeah, that's real great. Okay, give it like five stars on a sheet. And that's how they determine what music they're going to play. They're a bunch of jackasses. Okay. They're a bunch of idiots. The first thing is what kind of a person would participate? You know, it's obviously the kind of person that does nothing else to do. Oh, I don't get to do it. Yeah. Wait a minute. Okay, here it comes. You ready? Yeah. And we too. 1046 in WIOD, a part in us for getting hysterical and excited. But it's so damn frustrating. You try to talk sense to people in this business in this market. And they don't have any sense. They won't listen to you. They know it all. Okay. If they know so much, how come they're rating suck? You want to answer that question for me? Like Rose Fulger who wouldn't know a hit record if it bit them on the lip? What he knows about music, you could put in this can over here of diet cherry 7 up and have room for the entire Chinese army left over in drag. Okay. It's 1047 at WIOD, the music of your life. The research is ruining this country. I've said this before. Exactly. I've said this for years. Whatever happened to gut instinct. Yeah. When Gary Lawrence, I don't want to pick on him because he was okay to me, although he was a cheap bastard. But he was a pretty good guy. But at going there and arguing with him and the bottom line was he couldn't, in fact, nobody that was ever in that chair in that building or in this building, I'm not any idea. But can't you turn on the radio and listen to something with your own ear and decide if it sounds good? Not if you're in programming or if you're one of the executives, they got to bring it all these experts and they got to conduct studies and they got to have maggots, studies and pay $40,000 and he comes out with a big black book in there. It says the audience wants to hear the weather, the news and the track. They got to spend $40,000 to find out that the audience wants to hear the news weather and traffic in the morning. That's the kind of morons we have programming. These radio stations, folks, which is why you have so much boring crap on your radio. So enough to make me sick. Would you agree? They're Jackass's an idiot. Exactly. He is redeeming himself. Little slowly. Yes. Very important. What? Very important. You deliver it. Very nice. Great. When you're just relaxed for an end, it will be so hyper. Food from natural access to livelihoods. Gentlemen, of course, fat rich is digging into the bag in the very hands. Like an animal. I've never seen anything sort of disgusting in my life. So you're delivering it at night now from natural leads from what? What time? Five to nine. Look at that. Or five to eight. You're not sure about whether Fernando's got something else going on. Okay. We'll see how it goes. Well, it has not interesting. Okay. Let's just get the food open and cut the crap. 10.51 a WIOD. I'm sorry. You couldn't be here, vexed, and share our lunch with us. I would love to be there. Well, we'll talk to me for a second. Hold on one second. Okay. Now listen. We got a collect call from Jupiter. Now you're whole for that. Watch it. All right. I'll tell you one thing, boy. He really must be desperate. Because ordinarily, he would have hung up a half hour ago. Jupiter. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. This is Doc from Jupiter. Long time list for the color. Who is it? Doc from Jupiter. Doc? Doc, the O.C. Doc? Doc? But are we going to napkins in here, by the way? Oh, he's here. Don't bother. Don't mind us, Doc. We're eating. Bad radio, Neil. I know. I was flipping through the channels last night on the TV. And I caught Morton Downey's act last night. He did it all the time. Loaf. He's desperate. They had, uh. I heard that he's doing a video with Rob Lo. Good. He had on the worst part. The worst part. Hmm. The worst part. Yeah, the worst part. Were they tossing them on the show? No, no, no, no. Did they had a big mat? A what? A big mat? Ha ha ha ha ha. You know, like wrestling mat? Oh, I see, yeah. And, uh. Did they toss work? Because I would have paid to see that. No, no. The worst. Midges. It's a new thing going on around in the country. I get the bars. Mm-hm. And, though they had, uh. Was Bob Mayor on the show? Oh, no. Yeah. They had a bunch of, uh, dwarfs there that were against it because, uh, we've breaking bones and things like that and then he had these big, you know, like, football players throwing them for distance. Mm-hm. And, uh, I just thought you'd like to hear about that since you bring up working down in one soil. Yeah, he's really, he needs a publicity, believe me, boys on his last legs. Have it, Danly. I told you he had, uh, did nice say when we first came over here, he had another six months or so. Mm-hm. Yeah, I was just, yeah. I started with, and he came to, uh, I would date. And since we came over here, he's been moved from a prime time at night into the, Oh, and I want to clock in the afternoon on 39 here, plus you've been dropped out of several stations. Yeah, I watched him on, uh, what's in with that, uh, WR, like midnight. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. And, uh, yeah, I just thought he'd be interested in that dwarfs. Well, I don't want you to feel too bad because Mort made 40 million last year, okay. So he probably won't miss any meals, right? He even made enough to get the wards removed. Yeah, that's a few bucks more than I made. Yeah. All right, the home out of, uh, material. Okay, well, I was a great call, sir. I've learned anybody tell you otherwise. All right. It was almost as good as Steve's picking the frequencies. He, he, he, he, he, he, he, he. Okay, but. All right. Now, see that was worth waiting for wasn't it? Oh, yeah, right. Now, what do you want? All right, listen, why are you even shining me? What the hell does that mean? Every time the Roger puts you on hold you, hang up if we don't put you on in 30 seconds. Sounds like a really nice thing. That's a really nice thing. So, you know, we're going to be a very valuable vocal line. What is that? Soup? Well, you guys went crazy with this. This is good. And there's your group. Yeah, this is a, I wonder, which you have people laid the birthday. Thanks, Feds. I hope everything was great for you. I heard that day, I heard the radio. But, it came to speaking with her. You know, how you guys are the good time on the nation there. Yeah, it's unlikely how the good time on one. Here on this station. When? But the stripper. Last Thursday, yeah, that was quite a sure last Thursday. That was, that was Hank was here. Eating. Saying nothing, just eating. Well, he said a few little vicious comments. Yeah, he had a few shots. Wow, look at that. Hey, this is, can I give you an update? Mm-hmm. You remember how I'm famous for the strikers, right? Whatever you say. Did you hear about the foreball? The strikers have the suck in here? No. We don't care. Don't go under a stamp. Seeing how you're regretting again. Am I regretting? Okay. I will talk about it. But nobody cares about soccer here, okay? Well, the length is. No, he doesn't. He doesn't know a soccer ball from a ping pong ball. Soccer? Yeah. Which do you like soccer? Yeah, it's almost as big down here as hockey. That's put him right beside each other down at floor. By the way, game six in the NHL finals tonight on the sports channel, Florida. I'm nuts about it. Well, isn't it's been real exciting? Yeah, no. Oh, this is, I like that new song that you play. They got to get to you. That's a really good song. Yeah, it's great. Okay, see ya. Yeah, bye. Well, listen, we got ready to him, boy. Open line in Broward 524Wild. And Boca 2789463 and Palm Beach. No, no hope. What are you doing now? You're getting a little carried away. What is that? What do you mean from me? Man's a maniac. No, don't give that to me. I can't say I'm a big ZD and soup, but I'm the man's nuts. Let's do it. Let's do it. Don't underestimate myself. You're crazy. Let's some of the news people eat some of this stuff, okay? Like that big salad. Soup, what kind of soup we got today? Ooh, I love mushroom barley. That's my favorite soup. How did you know that? Just because we took shots at Fernando last week, he brought some good stuff. How is that baked ZD? Great. Great. And he was smart enough to bring two of them. Yeah. Here's a mobile on the Boca line, but this is a great call. Hello. It's a rif or call. Yeah. You've been numbering 10 to the last couple days. I've been hitting little bits and pieces here. Where are tots numbers? Ooh. Todd. Todd. Yeah, you're new little, uh... Oh, you mean Todd and the newsroom? Yeah. I'd say about a 13 and a half on a scale of six. Oh. That he moved to my car. Okay. Thanks, Neil. Yeah, that desperate sir. Not actually. Well, Ross will be in today, Ross is about an 18 and two thirds. I'd have to have to think about that. I'm not sure if I can lower his hang out in the newsroom, but I know if he has seen a lower except for a couple of seconds he's waiting for Ross to come in. Yeah, but if he's smiling. From ear to ear. There you go. That tells it all. Okay. Thanks Neil. 1057, a WID. Now, what were you saying about the Zed? I was a thing I like about it. It's got zucchini, like that. It's not great. I didn't get any of this last time. What did I miss out? Yeah. I think we made wind up eating all the food. Chris Richen is on the little quiet way over there. Yeah, Rich is here. Oh, you're going, you're not going to be mellow today here. I have a feeling. Yeah, not like last week was kind of frantic. Oh, God. Wow. Uh-oh. What do you want Henry Henry Never Eat? Henry's some. Unless it's liquid Henry. Do you so why? Oh, he'll be down to see you for now. Oh my God. Look at the size of the mushrooms in this mushroom barley soup. Makes me feel inadequate somehow. 1058. And WI would do the Boken Palm Beach lines of both dead. We don't really care though, doing as a tornado. Damn right. Miami. Hello. Yeah, yeah. Great. Alright, listen. I got to use VTA's firing forward. Yeah. Oh, those numbers, huh? Yeah, about that one five in the morning is my favorite. Listen, I was traveling down the county line road on south. And what did I see up there? Thanks, Randall. What's that? Sure, some sodas would be great. What head sir? What did I happen to see up on those highway billboard signs? It said, 94. Thanks, Randall. Watch this space. Watch, yeah. Yeah. You know what that means, don't you? It means there's some kind of a change coming. It means I 95. Mm-hmm. Great, huh? Could be. Alright. Or could be W-O-F-F? No, I doubt it. But doubt it. It'll be good to get on any fire back though. Yeah, sure would. We get a roll of squirrel back over there. Huh? Hi, 95. Maybe we'd have to give Johnny Dolan up to it after we kind of a trade. Oh, no. Okay, thanks for the report, pal. Alright, but you're a great American. It's 1059. You know what that means? That means Henry is slinking into the newsroom as we speak. And look at that. Rich is just having a 7,000 calorie salad over there. What kind of mining is owned business? Oh. And then we'll come back after Henry with the 11 o'clock news. 11 o'clock. Steve's got open phones today. We got the son he's going to be calling in with reports on a hurricane's game. All kinds of stuff here today. And even Yankee baseball at 730 tonight. Okay, I got one other question. Yeah. Is Rob in the door, please? Yes. Okay. That's why we don't hear from her anymore. Okay. We had a fake robin on yesterday. How do you like that? I kind of read. Yeah. Okay, sir. Well, I'm glad we were able to answer all the pressing problems. You're right. Are you going to be alright now? Oh, yeah. Sure. See ya. Don't encourage him. Well, yeah, let him go. Open line and brown. Five, two, four, Wiodine. Of course, the popping line is sitting there waiting for another call from Tel Aviv. We're somewhere far away from here. Okay. Anyplace. Even Montreal. And speaking to that, the Canadians and Calgary in a game six. It looks like the Canadians are right on the ropes, as they say. And that a hockey expression on the ropes. Yeah. Anyway, if you're on the ropes with your car, if it's on its last legs and seen a lot better days than the smart thing to do is get over to Toyota of Hollywood right now. Make a great deal. One of those hot new 89 Toyota's, like that beautiful super that I've driving today. In fact, I saw this 20 year old blonde kid that was driving it up and down the second house in the driveway. And then I realized I was hallucinating. I didn't have a shirt on, didn't he? He didn't have a shirt on and he was walking my dog. But seriously, the super is a great riding sports car. I like to call it a sports car with a limousine ride. And then check out the Camrys, a great family car, the Karol of the MR2 is a perfect first car for some little punk teenager that wants to go out and get a bunch of tickets. It's great. And you'll find the best deals ever right now at Toyota of Hollywood. Don't forget that special in the service department from now through the end of the month, which I know is in here somewhere.

Still on. And he punched up. I went to the store. I stopped somewhere. I don't know. What time's he come on? Three or two. But well, he was on. And he punched up a record and a CD player screwed up. And for the longest time, it was just bouncing around and repeating. I go away. And then finally you heard. Oh, no. Yeah. It's not possible. And he went to another record. No. Well, let's modern technology. Let's see. Let's pray that this one works over here on the other machine. No. He played the buzzer. And Greg has Greg plays it too. Greg. Did you see his numbers? It's incredible. Oh. Yeah. Okay. Hello. I put it on. And I just get a kick out of this. What's that from mother ran tail? Was that something that was good? Good one. Oh, that was the buzzer finish.
