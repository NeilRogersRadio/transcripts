No, actually I'm just saying I'm gonna first out in tears in a minute. Oh, no, don't get emotional. Okay. Let's try not to make fools out of ourselves. Sorry. Okay, Lori, hold on. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Wow. The emotional level in here is rising to a fever pitch. Okay. She's a mess. She is a wreck. I don't know who's more excited. Her Johnny dark at the prospect of pizza. I'm showing up. Hey, came in here during the news. Right. Where's the child? Where's the child? Or he is a crackable. I don't want to get into it. Oh, it's a very slow plantation. Good one. 12 17 and W. I do doing a good job. A screen. He's called ladies only. Okay, ladies, ladies. Do we have to draw you a diagram, Nick? Too many of those shows with Reverend Polar. So, no, he doesn't know a lady from his arm pit. God, maybe George will have to answer the phones with the straight now. That's embarrassing, isn't it? 12 17 and W. I would say 751 9463 and day, 524 W. I would say in Broward. See, they're off flashing, but he's going through this traumatic. Are you a lady? Yes, I am. Well, you are. Thank God. Did you hear that last one? Yeah, that was no lady. Yeah. Now, are you waiting for Donnie Osmond? Yes, I am, but I like talking to you too. Oh, okay. Today, oh, you mean another time? Oh, well, anytime. Okay, hold on. Okay. She didn't want to talk to us. You have to lie and make us feel better. You don't have to do that. We'll survive. Hello. Hi, how are you? Great. Are you really going to have a month, Minna? What do you think? Well, I don't know. I just turned down my boyfriend's home from work today and we listened to you every day. Now, why did you call him Osmond? Donnie Osmond. Yeah, you're have to be embarrassed to say that. I mean, I know it sounds a little pre-pubescent and everything, but you can say that. I know. And you want to talk to him? Yeah, I'd love to. Hold on. I think little nervous about that when you don't understand. Yes, little nervous. You think we're having what's his name from C. Me. Yes. Oh, Charles, Charles Osmond. Charles Osmond. Yeah. No, she does. She really does. She doesn't have Donnie Osmond. I'm a flipper. And Luke happened by the way. Might be stopping by, okay? Anyway, George is here to take pictures. Channel 7 is coming by. Johnny Dark is here to eat. Pizza law. The probably be here any minute. Just really something. It's not like what usually happens on the show. Is it? Mm-hmm. Were they just ignore the cramp out of us? Okay. The Broward Air, Boca. He's at the door, ladies here. The gentleman he's at the door. Nick is on his way to get him. Mm-hmm. Oh, what do you do? Hi. You know Roger's there? Yes. Do you want to speak to Donnie Osmond? Yes, they want to speak to Neil. Yeah, we don't want to speak to Neil. Yeah, I don't blame you. Hold on. Hold on. What do you do? Hello. Goodbye. Okay. So we got the Dayton Broward lines all set up there and all those ladies out there. And the one on two, I'm not the one with Charles Osmond. Yeah. Just, uh, yeah. I want to check her again. You're still there, right? Hi. Hold on. No panic. No, Palm Beach. Okay. Good one. Lee Fowler wanted to talk to me. Great, but his spot just ran out and he couldn't hold on any longer. Sorry about that, Lee. You'll have to make do with the guy. What's that? He had a great show today, boy. I did. I did. He was always incredible. Let me look at that. Something about how to make your flowers grow. Do they have pretty much wrong? No, I think he had Steve Pizzacano or whatever that guy's name was. That the guy was talking about yesterday. Yeah. That was growing those funny flowers and his back yard or something. Boca. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, you keep hanging up on me. I know. Too bad. Oh, Beach. Mike, no, look, please. Okay, hold on. Okay, 20 extra new. Now we're getting somewhere. And WI OG. Okay, let's begin the break. Because I see the whole entourage is coming in here. This is pretty exciting. Look at this. They're just thousands. Well, thousands of people flocking in here. Well, we haven't had this much excitement since Mike Disney came in. Right? You're not with the farmer's sake. It was shocking. Donnie is there. Nick is really finally doing a little bit of work now. This is so exciting. I could just pass out on the floor and there he is. Ladies and gentlemen, the star of stage and screen. How's your new? I think so. Last time I checked. Great. Donnie. It's wonderful to see. I got a lot of desperate drooling ladies on the phone waiting. The bird. Yeah, you can tell why I can't. For the bird. Johnny's in there. Johnny's in there. Johnny's. He just hangs around. He just hangs out in the eats. All right. You can relate to that. Look at that shirt that he's wearing. Is that incredible or what? That's incredible. I don't know. It looks halosh. Anyway, he's got a lot of stuff. See, he's got a lot of stuff. But I'm he leaves. How much are to be Jewish? Did you all know that? That's where Jewish? Yes. It's one of the best kept secrets in America. And these people from Channel 7 who are on work released by the way. They only work on haloh. We get when they let them out. It's incredible. Hey, I want to say one thing. I'm listening to you. You're not going to whisper in my ear. I'm not going to whisper in my ear. I'm not going to whisper in my ear. Destroy his image. Donnie, donnie. Really? What is that? Donnie. Donnie, you said on the ear. You said, ladies only. Why are you avoiding questions from the men? Oh, you never talked to anybody you want to talk to. I don't care if you were in for a lot of grief. Doesn't find why you want to talk to guys? Anything they want to talk about. Really? Is Marie's real name all of? It is. Say, we got that out of the way immediately. Something fake is called in yesterday. He said her name. I'm probably dead meat now for him for announcing that. Well, you and she are too tight anymore anywhere, right? No, despite what everybody thinks we are. We get long grade. We do, right? The only problem is we don't see each other that much. Yeah, she's so busy doing her thing. And that's only by accident. What? That you work on the East Coast when she's on a West and vice versa. As a matter of fact, this tour is taking us to love the same venues. Really? Yeah. And are you like hanging out together? No. I was talking to him. I like his refreshing honesty. You know, that's the one. Even when it hurts, it's incredible. Can I do a little break? No. Okay. I mean, you're sure we got all these ladies. Well, you don't want to talk to a bunch of dumb guys. What are you saying guys are dumb? Well, on this show they are. Yeah, trust him. Well, no. I want to prove that theory wrong. You call in. Okay. Anybody wants to call and make an answer to yourself. Okay. 23 afternoon, Donnie Osmond's in the building. Look at this. Oh, they don't come in. Now, I want to tell you, you saw Channel 7 is right next door. Yeah. They never come in here. We could be arrested for a murder. On this show, we could do anything in a world. They wouldn't come over here. It's too far. True. Too far. We'd be on a front page of the Harold. We're going to go ahead and do it. But Donnie Osmond comes in and air here snapping and shooting. I'm smiling and puking and licks. I'm just embarrassed. Anyway, come in. What is the prize? And look at that. She's got an album. She looks really desperate today. Okay, Laura, come right on in here. Laura wants to give you a big hug in a kiss. You don't mind that too. His wife's not too crazy about it. That's okay. By the way, you notice how big that wedding ring is that he's wearing. It's like I'm the message. Now, I'm talking about the ring. Anyway, here's a quick. Yeah, I can't wait. You're right. Did you hear what he just said? Hi, Laura. She said she doesn't care. Look at her. I just, it's all made up to you. You look just like Tammy Faded. I can't believe that. Well, close. The mascara's running down her puppet. It's incredible. Down her way. Down her thing. Now, what are you going to sign her album? This is great. Forget the call. I want to keep people on an image. But this is like history and a making. Laura, Laura. Laura. Okay, sterile. And he's got the pen. And he just, look at what he did with it. It's incredible. Look at her. She. Yes. That'll say when you were to see that's what he's trying to break away from me. No, it's not. No, he doesn't. I want to get that up. He wants to be a teen years old again. No. Yes. Despite what a lot of people think, I am not embarrassed about my past. I have to admit though. It's a funny way that he put it, isn't it? Yeah. But I have to admit. I wasn't pretty in my life. But that I just, just regarded everything I did because it was the very thing that was Bring me down on the gutter with my career. You know, the Danny has and the goody two shoes, things, you know. But that's what she loves. That's why I don't deny it anymore because it was a big part of a lot of people's lives. It got me to this point where I am now. Although she said she would leave with you today at the end of the show. But you know, we'll talk about it. So I can sacrifice. You got what? Scott is with you. Yeah. Or her boyfriend's here supervising. Okay. Boys are the ever. But you dump him in two seconds, right? Yeah. Don't put her in that. She's a guy. She doesn't need a ride home. Didn't know. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I don't want to make fun of the past anymore. I don't want to deny that. I don't want to put it down because, hey, there were some good songs in the 70s. For the time, I mean, they certainly wouldn't hold up now. But I'm sure a lot of people are doing tonight. That for instance. Yeah. Yeah. See we got it all here. We're over there. And Dick Clark has a list of the best summer songs ever written. And I think that's number 16. And his church. Did he say that to us when he called that day? Somebody noticed. It was. Well, like it royalties on all that also. Okay. We know how you guys are working on that. You're not playing again. We're going to get a more paid family play. You know, it's BMI and Ask after you're finishing it on that. You better. But you know, somebody called a little while ago. What is that? Oh, geez. I get so panicky when those beepers go off. Listen to that. T. Must be Joey Reynolds. Anyway, somebody made an interesting point. Oh, I don't know. But it's you. I don't know. You don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. He's old enough to be your great grandfather. He's got a midday. He got well. It's pretty weak. He used to be the monster. Like when I was a kid growing up about 80 years ago in Buffalo, he was on a radio. He was a giant in the industry. Maybe I know his face. But I know. You don't want to know his face. But anyway, somebody made the point that Michael Jackson started out, like his little tip squeak in the question five and all those prepewbess and records. And his career has gone steadily, although you haven't had any plastic surgery, which may be part of it. But it's gone along without any interruption and he's got, I don't know, does he have the same following or different following? No. Michael took a different route. Who's to say what happened? I mean, I don't really know. I think television had a lot to do with it. As big as it was for Donnie Osmond, every of Donnie and Maria should say, it kills a record career. And there's something about television that is almost very plastic. And he did see Joey show up. Particularly variety, you know. It worked for the time. There is no more variety. It doesn't work nowadays. It is very plastic. And people are not so naive anymore. And they know what goes on behind the scenes. We're going behind the camera. And you can't take them out anymore. So it's not so goody, goody and everything's so perfect. Because we're not living in a perfect world. Nobody's that goody, goody. And that's why when you were doing those shows, you weren't that goody, goody. Exactly. Right. Exactly. The show, how we going to hear about that? Well, the show had a certain format that had to stay that way. Because we were getting the ratings. And we were locked into a format, Neil, that gave us that very good, good, clean cut, wholesome image. Now mind you. I wasn't in the drugs. I don't know that whole type of scene. So if you want to call that goody, goody, goody, then I'm goody, goody, goody. I got you guys today's standard. By today's standards. And that's why you started hanging out with George Michael and Boy George. I did. I don't always know what the all the tabloids say that he went to England and he was, okay, okay, that was based on my image being so good clean cut. I want to be Hollywood parties. And people got pictures of me hanging out with Boy George. We were going to do some collaborating together for real. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I don't know if it's going to be something completely different than what I am. Which is very normal down to a person, you know, I'm not this guy. Oh, I'm not this guy. I'm not an influencer. You know, I was a little pressured boy, and her eyebrow, and he said that, her eyebrow just went all the way to where forehead. It's like, what is the top? I don't know. But Donnie, I wasn't able to seem to have this boy and a bubble. That type of image was so long that he could do no wrong. He's so perfect and going to get a boy next door. Well if you got any video cassettes like Rob Loone, Rob loan, now that could do a lot. I'm proud of the fact that I don't have any Rob loan for themselves. Yeah, I don't know. I'm going to disagree with you on that one. You think I do? You bet you. And that's a sad scenario on society nowadays is because we'll look at Vanessa Williams. Okay, there's another good example. How controversy helps as a matter of fact, Patrick Leonard, believe in his name. He produced Madonna's material. He came out with a quote, got back to me through a friend of my music director's matter. That he said controversy sales. If you can be controversial nowadays, people buy your material. You'll get press and the more pressure get, the more popular you be careful about that on this show, maybe. Well, it's true. When you think about it, the more controversy you controversial, you can be. That's why these guys call up and they say what they say because it causes time, it causes excitement. What guys? Well, you know, like a couple of phone calls ago, that you guys. Oh, you mean a once call in here today? Yeah, we get that every day. They just, they just have a little problem. Yeah, that's a little problem. Very little problem. Big problem. No, I don't think so. But we'll find out. Okay, 1234, I WOD, well, we get back. Cause we, and I don't know how long you're going to stay. I'll stay when I'm done. Until I'm done, I should say. And then like, oh, and pizza lofts here. So food is, we got anything you want. I want pizza. How did the end? Laura's going to feed you. He's going to hand the feed you. Okay, it's going to be just a obscene look at this. And you notice, now, Jeff usually comes in alone. But today he's got a lot of plants. Land is mad and crap. He's got a, you know, a helper is some pizza loft, bringing animals. What's in that box? What? T-shirts and all kinds of hazeriah. Look at the hair. It's not incredible. Isn't it incredible? And he must have heard that at every few, at the parents, right? Great. Great. Okay, so you're going to dish the food out. I'll do a little break here while you're getting out the food ready. See now we figure that out a way to make him stay. If you're looking for a great night of entertainment for your family, call 38 at WIOZ. Okay, we have done the TV people on TV people. Once they're doing stuff, the radio people are like, P.O. Okay, they're just in radio. You know, we're the TV folks. Anyway, the audio is stuff meeting. It is excellent pizza loft is brought all the great stuff. And we do eat on the air, okay, which is great radio. But we don't really give it down, right? What is that? Are you giving them a GTR T-shirt? Great. All right. Great. You'll be able to be dressed for a long time when you leave here, and you leave with all the good t-shirts from pizza loft and GTR, little pizza there. What is that? Cells on? Cells on? Geez, just incredible. The works. Okay, so how's he often doing? It's doing great. We're almost going great. We're hoping that by time Christmas rolls around or the new year rolls around. Well, we're going to put you right over the edge. No, I'm going to tell you. And if I really do appreciate it. If our people next door and GTR had any brains, they'd be planted too. But their numbers are dropping like a rock and that's part of the reason. You know, that's true. I'm sure they appreciate you saying that. Well, listen, this is the honor show. Kay had hurts and they're scotting their laughing. He knows it's true. He knows they're searching for an audience desperately. But once they start playing the good stuff, they didn't even play the Roy Orbuson record, right? Which was number one ALR record in the country. We were playing and we don't even play music on this show. It seems as though people are very careful as to where they do it. Yeah. A lot of people are sheep in the business. They always try to follow the trends and see what's going on rather than sticking their necks out and saying, I like this. Let's go for this. And using their ears instead of statistics. Yeah. While they're using some part of their body over there, I don't think it's their ears. But anyway, I want to get a lot of these calls on it. I want you to think that it's just we want all these young ladies to call it and gush over you. But this is like for them, it's their whole life. You do understand it. It's like, he's serious. I don't know what you're laughing about. It's true. Like they're just foaming at them. I like her. Look at her. She's really usually looks very nice. Today she's got enough makeup on. Seriously, I don't understand you. You're an ordinary woman. You're a wonderful woman. She is. She's attractive. She's wonderful. She's bubbly. But today she looks like Alice ghostly. She's got enough. Because you wanted to impress him. Isn't that true? She looks nice to me. Well, there you go. So she didn't impress you. But you see what I mean. You came in. I like him. He doesn't. He's got that crappy shirt on. He doesn't come here to impress you. He doesn't. You look like you got that. It came hard. You saw rain. This was a very expensive rain. You sure, my Indian. Yeah. And you saw you heard what Raymond said. He said, came art sucks. Okay. Well, that's right. Now he goes and buys that. Like probably he was not a key mart shirt. Oh, got a key mart shirt. Where did you get it? It's cool. Don't tell me it's weird. No, is it? Got it. It's all right. Yeah. No. He gave a man. He was shocked. He was shocked. At the Maundee Troy. Where did he Troy? Westland. Eastland. No. Okay. It's a bit of an L. You were just in Detroit? Yeah. Because I was in this world. I went to Michigan for 12 years. Not that you care about that. What do you mean? Did you really? You were at the game yesterday? Well, it was at the Browns. Great game. You believe that. Right. In a section of the very end. I thought he scored on it. And we were dead. Show. He didn't count. Oh, it didn't count. No. Because it was already 13 to 10. And that was the final score. What do they call it back? Does anybody know? They didn't count. He's looking to look. I'm getting like, we own. We don't know nothing about football. That must be your crowd. Well, you would know. That's a good idea. Sorry. Wait a minute. One, which is very rare, by the way. Okay. Let's show you. Who's that on the bat line? Is that another insight call or is he doing another deal with Joey? I think you've had a lady holding for an hour and 15. Okay. Let's get her right out. Okay. Are you anxious to speak to her? Well, for a while. He's been holding you. Hello. Hi. This is your big chance. Who is this? I don't know. I don't know. I'm calling from on North Miami. North Miami. You've been holding for how long? 15 minutes, no, in 20 minutes. Yeah, on you, Neil. Denise? Yes. What have you been holding? It's just a joke Denise. Don't answer the question. I've been at the end of your day now for about 15, 16 years. So, and this is the first time I get to talk to you. I've got a brilliant answer. But I've never been fortunate enough to meet you though. Well, it's nice to talk to you, Lisa, with the phone. You were living in Florida all your life? No. I'm living from New York. I went to school in California and... What part of California? Malibu. Okay. Yeah, it was really nice over there. But anyway, did you have nice things giving us today? I did. As I was telling Neil and Glenn, I went to Lion's Game in Detroit and had a little turkey dinner and a whole bit. It was kind of fun with my wife and my little boy. What about your other boys? They're back in Los Angeles. I flew them out earlier on the tour separately. And they joined me and watched what I do. Is that your little boy in there? Is that your little boy? Yeah. Are you sure? Really? Does it mean how old is he, Donnie? Four? Four? Yeah. Doesn't he look a little like Jimmy? Little? Yeah, he does. Not Jimmy Osmond, Jimmy Carter. He's eating beef. Wouldn't that be something his son will grow up to be president someday? Then he won't have to worry about all this crap. He's going to go ahead, Donnie. I'm sure I'm taking up your time with all this bad material. That's okay. How old are your boys now? Well, I tell you. I'm not going to talk about that too much because that's my private life and I try to keep that as private as possible. They're just normal kids. They're not always in a normal business, Donnie. Okay. I like he's paying no attention to this. He's just eating pizza. I like that. You better normal lifestyle. When we asked you about your tour, then how much on do you have your tour? About another month, three weeks or so, something like that. We end up in Los Angeles. We're going to hit New York here next week and then work our way west until we hit Los Angeles. And that's the last show. Are you planning another album too? Well, I'm going to jump into that in January. I don't know exactly when I want to release it because I'm going to take my time to see. I'm going to critical position in my career right now because this next album, if it's anywhere near a very poppy, formulated album, my career is over. Because I've got the attention of the industry now with this album. It was an interesting story to be told with what everybody's referring to as a comeback. I'd like to refer to it as a resurgence more. But I'm going to make sure that the quality of this next album is good straight rock and roll. Real strong material. I'm not going to tour a lot next year. I'm going to just stay in the studio and really work hard on the album because I think too many bands make the mistake of touring too much. And then the second album is doing, say, well, let's go in the studio and hurry and rush this album out. And it's a suffers. So I'm going to take my time with it. Are you planning to write any of the material from the next album? Oh yes. Oh yeah. Great. In fact, that started. Okay. What about TV, do you prefer to do any of that? No. No, that again. I'm not a TV. I have had my own video. Yeah, he hates TV. All of the videos videos, videos, videos, yeah. Yeah. A special appearance is here and there, but not a series. Okay. How about acting? Do you plan to do any of that as far as maybe movies? Well, here again. If I'm going to do that, I'm going to make sure that it's good.
