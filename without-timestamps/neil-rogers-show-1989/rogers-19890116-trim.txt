The understanding you and the foam keeps like making all these weird noises. Are you? I know this is a lady. I'm sure. Yeah, I remember now from Zeta you told us. Well, the fish were jumping with Glee. Yeah. They were jumping with Glee. Yeah, I have to keep you up there to ask you now the super bowels here. Yeah. And my mission was to find some activities of our own. Oh, that's a bow. Now, you know some of these other activities have chosen to include some of these these silly minority groups. Well, we have decided to concentrate just on the Anglo-Saxon Protestant angle of the Super Bowl. Now, how tell you what we have planned. But now first of all for the children, now for the right children that will become in property. Oh, no. We will be providing cooperation with local churches, a Christian petting zoo. The children will either have the chance of tapping some of our local Christians. Who have decided they will be petting? Or they can pet cute little bunnies and white mows. Now we're also offering male fest 89. Now this will take place the weekend before the big game. The citizens will be invited to community and stuff their faces. But there's many wonderbred and mayonnaise sandwiches as they can smell. Now as a dad and bonus if they can speak German while eating these sandwiches, they will win the grand prize and of course as always. This is that is hosted by Rick Shaw. Oh, yeah. That does it for me. Yeah. Now the grand finale. This is really going to flip this city on its side. We're going to melt down giant, large statues of a chosen white Christian player from each of the competing teams. Now once they're out to down we will have a communal large pool. In the center of the money shows country. Yeah. I'm gonna invite all citizens to come in and spin briefly and express all the way to Christian emotions. And of course, and be sure we'll be hosting this event. As always. And of course, any Canadians that are out to come by, we are. As always, we're offering free showers for all of them. You know, it's pretty quick. My heart is so to go by these trailer parks, but they live and see them watching. They're clothing and the water fountain. And we can't even get them. Well, anyway, now I just think life is dreading. Of course, I am praying for you. I am praying. Well, keep it up is this. Thank you, Dad. Okay. Oh, yeah. You can listen. And I have for half hour 45 minutes. And there's absolutely nothing on the air except this guy is a jerk. That lady is a whatever. And so I'm on and on and on and on and on and on and on. Well, I'm reporting fall apart, but they all work. Just don't touch him. That's all. I love shot with nature on the way up. Yes. I am told him that you loved his work. I do love his work. He's the best. What does that mean was that sarcastic? No, we had some problems in here last week. And he came in and he said, don't mess with these other people. They're wonderful. But they're all on work release. Just come to me and out of here the overhead. We got complete control over it and we can turn it off or we can strike it up. Oh, we want to use the height here. That's sunny, Chair. But sunny is in California for bad. You must be in here. That's Henry's chair. Henry, when he does a little wine tasting and resits in that chair. No, I want you to sit in that chair for just a second. So you can understand when you're stupid little that wine. Henry's very big in a way. Yeah, no worries. Keep sitting there for a second. It goes down. See, it drops down. But that knife isn't that good. It's something you're right about that chair. I don't know what it is. I think we know why sunny sits in her all the time. So what are you doing, Stan? Just a drop by. Just wasn't the neighborhood. Probably was over the forest for a little lunch. I don't think so. No, I figured you would have the lunch here. What do you want food? Sure. You think carmine is listening to me? I go for a salad. I know that. Well, it's 1140. You know what? No, it's not real, man. He's doing so great on his diet. What we ought to do is really you ought to start ordering the really big stuff. The really good things. Yeah, big things. Big things. Big things. The father's on. The mother. The only thing that bothers me are when they bring in like three of those giant cheesecake. That bothers me. You can even even the key lime pie the other day. Now you panic because you thought I was going to eat the whole thing. You know, like when you heard that. Yeah. But luckily, I had a new persistent spot coming up. I kind of tempered my thinking. I thought, well, this is embarrassing. The one thing that I was going to do. And who he owed to Holly would Saturday. I didn't eat a thing. I think I could have you on water. And I was it. You probably couldn't have gotten near the food. No. People out there. Joe was there early. Really? I want to find out what you eat at the track. Because you go to the track. You talk about the horses. You talk about the race. One and a half. I have a craft of ice tea and a bowl of onion soup. And Linda gives me hell about the onion. It's got a lot of salt. I'll buy about. And I say, Linda trust me. How many onions does it have in it? The whole thing. Yeah, I have to count the onion. I count my green. So Carmine's listening. I stand. I love that big ZD. I bet four horses got great big ZD. Oh, that would be great. I haven't been eaten too well. And they're right up the streets. See, so there's no problem. They'll probably bring it by or something like that. Even though it is a holiday. They are open to their eyes. I assume so. This is a weird holiday. Yeah. I don't mean to be demeaning to Dr. King. But you know, I wish we'd get ourselves together in this country. I mean, we're either going to do it or we're not going to do it. There's a lot of people going to do it. I don't want to do it. For instance, like that town of New Jersey, where they wanted to change the name of the street, and wanted the black politicians. So we don't want to do it because it'll give the area bad image. We won't be able to sell any real estate because people will think it's an all black neighborhood. This was a black politician who said that. Well, listen, I thought I was down on my lock until some friends in our neighborhood. Two children, young child and older boy went skiing up in New Jersey this weekend. Both broke something. Two kids and one full isn't at part of the whole team trip. But isn't that part of the thing when you go skiing used to break a leg or something? But two children. I mean, one did it like on Friday, I think, and another did it on Sunday. Well, you know what they say? The family will skis together. Oh, let's just together. Kids, you'll get some of this in the years to come. You will. So when you go on a work, oh my god, I just realized Christopher looks like boy. I asked the wrong question. What was he? Oh, really? That's a good thing. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Boy, this could be really interesting. Christopher looks like Clint. I just realized. I just realized. Something going on here in our old pot. Do we want to talk about? No. No. You sure know. No. It is incredible because I have this story and this is perfect story for you. This is out of the new world weekly newsstand. You will enjoy this so much. A chubby weirdo who gets his kicks posing as a professional stripper has condesway into six women's dorms, say cops, and talk the ogling co-eds into greasing him with baby oil as dances. He tells the students that a friend of theirs has paid into perform for them and they believe him says police detective Richard Reynolds of Dayton, Ohio. Cops haven't been able to catch the dirty dancing phony. He knocked on the front door of University of Dayton woman's residence in November. Told the students are friend of theirs hired him from a local agency to perform for the hey, what a way to get the door. Yeah. Now since one of the students was celebrating her 21st birthday the next day, they believed his story and let him in. Now before he begins to strip T's, the fake grass the students to lock the door and tell them not to take photos or make phone calls while he performs. He's usually able to talk the girls into rubbing him down with baby oil as he wiggles the food on the floor. Okay, let's form a new company. Sounds good to me. But before you go, could you do one short thing for me? What's that thing? Just say freeze major Miami vice you're under arrest. Actually I'm not going to do that. Okay, it's not going to be a four. Who's he going to marry this week? Melanie. He's going back to Melody. Well, evidently he got his eyes fixed, right? I think I think no, sir. I don't think John Johnson and Barbara Streisand. No, I mean, and what's your name? Angie Dickinson, go to the same time. Yeah, somebody brought by a whole bunch of those bumper stickers again to Toyota Holly. Would they brought out that say a honky of Larry King Osu money? Oh, really? I love those. Okay, we do have an open line and Broward. I see the lines going on. Stan is here. Five, two, four. Oh, why OD. Oh, no, the foot is better. No, no, no, no, no, no. No, the, I know the funds were really hot during the first hour. I heard that. No, they weren't. Yeah, they were. But it's no, no, they were good. It's just that in the very beginning, what got me a little nervous is because there was one line lit. And usually when we sit down, they're like four or five lit already. We don't have to even give the numbers out. There was only one but it is a major holiday. Is it? No. That's a good excuse. Margie, hello. Yeah, oh, we cried. So I stayed on there a long time, huh? Whatever you said. Listen, you only got sounds like it was worth it. What? I say, it sounds like it's going to be a great call. Yeah, you're right. At least you have good people walking to the door, right? You, but listen. They had a stand. Thought that I was your out there. They had a stand. Is that? See, how to stand. Hey, Stan, what's happening? Nothing. Nothing at all. Listen, that thought today was you we go out there now. It is. Okay. Let me ask another question. There's push a special yesterday. I want them to be bringing an infission to the White House. I'm 46 a WLOD. We have an open line of bread. That's obviously a bush on there. At 524 WLOD. Let's go to Miami. Hello. They all got a question for Stan. Where did that come from? The thing with Don Johnson. Did you have a place all the time? That came out of an interview when I had Michael Topped on the show. Don called in. I see. I've always wondered that when the old plays at all time. I wonder how that came about. The last thing I asked Don before he hung up was if he would say freeze-mater Miami by a sneeze. And you know what he said? I don't need a damage. He doesn't. The answer is so funny the way he says it. Yeah, that time. It is wildest dreams ever. He never dreamed. The real story is and we can laugh on it now. But it was serious business back then. Stan got very, because Stan played the entire interview about 40 times on the year. It was long and it killed a lot of time. But he left out, yeah. Yeah. That was important. The interview. So I somehow somebody slipped me the call on now. You know I played it all the real story. We don't tell it from your van. Really, Jay. This man didn't speak to either one of us. And finally one day we had somebody go down a hall at about a quarter to two and drag him out of the office and bring him in for peace making on he. And the only reason he came in is because we stopped playing it. He does, he's to do it to this day. He does not know the real story behind that. Well, that's the way I remember it. Just so he told us. No, no, absolutely not because we were recording the tablet show on the big Reels. And when John Johnson came on at the end of an hour at the end of a real. And it started speeding up. And it was going faster and faster and faster. I know I swear. We had to get an interview. We didn't get that last part of the game. But if that's the case then how come you got to upset when I played it? The tape ended. Say, you know the tape is ended. I swear to you, Neil, the tape ended before he said that. Right. Right before he said it. He did say it. And we had to get a copy from a listener. Yeah. But does that answer the question? Why did you get so hysterical when I played it on there was just a joke. As Jay Michaels would say. Yeah. It's three hundred DX to get rid of it. Yeah. I got a question about the buy maybe a 240 SX and then when they just came out with. Yep. It's got, did your car have anti-lock breaking on it? Yeah. Because you see it's slide all the time. That's all I think. I hated that car. Trust me. Go over to Toyota Hollywood. I got a spot coming up for them right now. Go over and get a super-ed forget about that other stuff. Okay. Trust me. But you said it's written the rain was that it or it's slid on dry pavement. What the hell would it do on the red? In a rainy you just spin around like that studio that Eric the goons. All right. We're last thing, hey, Stan. Yeah. We're last thing. I talked to buddy of mine. His name is Happy and he said that. Oh, God. Oh, Jesus. Man, just let me save this. Go ahead. I know. If the super ball does not adapt Junior. If you want to make some extra money, he can, he can, he can, he can help you out. Okay. I want to see you in closing, pal. Good day. No changes. Oh, I would love just for fun to have somebody to so I can keep my name before the public. To have somebody have me paged in the middle of the Super Bowl. You know, on the public address, you're really going to hear it right. By the way, before you do the toilet spot, let me say something great about them. We had some problems with lorries, told it. Took it in there. I mean, it was great. Best. Great. You never talk about the service. Yes, I do. I always mention, or he's most of the time, that the toilet, the toilet, the toilet, the toilet, would serve as to probably repeatedly want a president to work from the parts and service and the vice is a floor to the best service they are. In fact, he even got a place where you can stand there and look through the glass and watch them work on your car. It can never hurt of it in my life. The best. Well, I haven't had a problem with the car since I, thanks a lot. Thanks a lot. Now, they're super folks over there. You hear my story about drag racing, yeah, Mark Jacobson up university drive. Yeah, two by the way, some cops are out. That would have been a market still working hard over there. One of these days, he'll be able to afford a Corvette. And I realized that the other thing, or a Corvette, is not made by Toyota, but not seriously. This week, I'm not joking about that this week. I'm taking that horrible teabird over there and he's going to get my me out of that lease and get that all straightened out and I'm going to lease it. Yeah, we have to take the Toyota anytime we're going to place. You say, no, the supers are forcedored. Oh, it is. Oh, yeah. Really? Absolutely. Okay, good. So anyway, we invite you to get over to Toyota Hollywood again. I want to thank the nice people over there. Very, indeed. We're sorry. All of our circuits are busy at this time. If this is an emergency, eh? Thank you. It's 1154 at WI-O-D. Stan Maygers here, and of course, the Stan is desperately looking for a little publicity, but I can understand it. Okay, let's go to this mobile and Palm Beach. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'd like to want to tell you that everybody's taking off on you on the other stations. I tried to get you a couple weeks ago. And you were talking about the positive shoes being murdered out in California and how they, the narrator program was telling the, hey, it looked to be careful, be safe. And I was. Yeah. I think you're hallucinating, sir. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Remember, honey such conversation. Yes, you were stating the fact about how the narrator was telling the girl to be careful. She was a street walker. Oh, yeah, about that show. Yeah, that was a long time. Right. The next day on KGR, the one in this jockey, he said the same thing. So it was just funny, you know, I don't know. The Lee Fowler disease, he steals all my material and all the steves. Yeah. So I just want to call it, you know, that those other people, you know, on Newtab Radio stations are taking off on you. All right. All right. All right. All right. All right. Bye. Okay. Let's see. We got somebody for a lot of day. We saw the movie. Hello. No. Didn't see the movie. What happened? I was watching cable last night. Yeah. They had one of those, you know, behind the scenes making of. The first time I saw it, I was watching that alone. I decided to wait till it was on cable to see it. Oh, I see the one good thing about that is you'll be able to turn it off. Yeah. And flip and flip to something else. You know, I will say this. One guy in the theater. I would say in his 50s, he did after about a half hour. He got up and walked out. And I was wondering. I thought I wonder if he's going to the John. One of us are in total. And you know, seriously, no, I'm not knocking him. He just walked out. He never came back. And I don't blame him. This is one of those movies that will be on cable and about two of us. That's what I'm thinking. What about three months on? Well, they're going to be desperate to get to believe something out of this thing. Yeah. Well, without even seeing it, I'm waiting till then. Trust me. Great. Great. Great. Great. How's your cable coming in? Very good. A channel six was coming in. Oh, real TV. No. Saturday night because of the rain. Oh, I see. Well, I've been spurred once in a while. But yesterday, sick was so bad. It was like not a shadow. It was like a shadow of a shadow. The worst it's ever coming. Anybody tell you we're on the front page of the Sun Sentinel Sunday? No. Yeah. About your satellite dish. Absolutely. About my satellite. I don't have what about it? A story about the way people are retaliating against the cable companies by buying satellite dishes. Excellent idea. I'm putting my back up. No. I've already talked to the guy. I haven't read the story. I was told this. So I'm paraphrasing it. But something about don't make the mistake that Neil Rogers, the WIOD, did. By not going through all of the, you know, the red tape in getting the zoning and all that kind of thing, setting it up because you can't get in a big problem. It wasn't anything negative. It was just, you know, warning people. Sounds real positive. Yeah. Well, I didn't make the mistake. It's the day of people. That's what they said. Don't believe what the salesman said. Oh, yeah. Because a lot of people who was the WIOD companies will just come and say, Oh, don't worry about the permit. We'll take care of that. And if you have any problem, we'll follow it through. And they don't follow through. They don't do a damn thing. Once they got your money, you're on your own. You know, and that was the problem. But the page of some of these times, it will be done. Because my landlady said, oh, my anything you want, cut the tree down. Anything you want to make you happy. There is just so delirious to have tenants who are actually paying the rent. Oh, yeah. And that house that they can't believe it. She was in town for the art show in Poland, really. Which I know, excites the audience. We got a mobile. Are you going to get a little boat for Lutterd. Oh, geez. Hello. Somebody was asking me that last night. Yes. How are you doing, Neil? My brother came out the toy of Hollywood yesterday and saw you yesterday. Yesterday. I bet it was exciting. I was there Saturday and saw him. Mr. Yeah. I know we came out and you weren't there now, listen. We came out Saturday. And you look like a different person. I mean, we saw you up at the Broward Mall when I got about it. I guess about a year ago. Yeah. You mean when they had to bring drop me to the ceiling with a crane. Yeah. A big difference. Yeah. You look great. But that's why I bring a fan rich along because it's like to be for an Africa. But he's on well too. He's a right way to have an 100 pounds. I wanted to thank you for sighting my son's roller. Oh yeah. Yeah, you're the one. That promotional director, whatever she was got all excited. We didn't have a sheet of paper. And it was just a thought. And she started going crazy. Was that Karen? They can picture. Yeah. She all year sharing gets very emotional. And Neil signed any body parts. Yes. Yeah. There was a lady. You've seen her before. She had an unbelievable t-shirt. Oh, kind of a chunky lady with enormous, you know what's. And I signed one of them and Steve's on the other. I mean, on the t-shirt. There was one lady that I remember. She was holding a place. You wait about 250. Yeah. She's about 70 years old. And she's holding a plate of food. And she walks up to the table. She throws down a sheet of paper. She goes on a grass. Oh yeah. I don't remember that. You don't remember that. I do remember some things that took place in some of the people. But you know how selective my mind works. But my brother made this statement to me. You don't seem like the same person when you're out at one of these. That is correct. It's just a radio show. Yeah. There was nobody you hear on the ear. Who does the same in, you know, private life as they are on the ear. That's a very nice, very nice, shy gentleman. That is correct. And we're happy to meet you. Okay. All right. Thanks for coming out. All right. We're going to be in the next hour. And we're desperately waiting for food to show up. We want to, we don't want to be embarrassed now. Stan majors here who desperately needs to be fed. And if Carmine or the people over there at Flores are listening, don't let us down. Okay. Realizing it's a little late. It was 20 till 12. So we'll wait about another half hour. Then we'll start getting crazy. And a big Zed and a couple of pieces and stuff like that. And the for Nick who has to work today on holiday. Open up. This is social director over here. I can't control himself. I'm going to stay in a long time. Well, believe me. Haven't missed a thing. I don't know. It's certainly son of a bitch. Okay. It's seven minutes past noon at WIOD. We have an open line in Palm Beach. 655, 9463, 655, WIOD. The food will be here any minute. I can just feel it. By the way, so Cheryl is working today. Yeah. Sharon is not here. But I saw Cheryl and she looked so he made sure it. Now if Flores should set a bunch of food. She should share it. Maybe she would. I don't think she's probably listening right now. Do you? Who knows? She should be. Yeah. Who do? Maybe we could call him or something. Just to make sure. I don't want standing a child on the food today. This is very important. And I know Gulf Streams not open today. So Carmides not at the track. Right? Yes. At Thursday. They will be open next Monday. By the way, the day after the Super Bowl. Have a special Monday card. Next week and we'll be closed. Next Tuesday. We from the Lord of Us. Super Car. Yeah. Super Car. Super Car. Super Car. Okay. It's 12 o'clock to WIOD. My name is the way he's picked up on the track. My name. Good afternoon. Don't let these people intimidate you. They're doing a social thing here. They're changing phone numbers. Moving around. Just the show must go on. I want to see what is the radio talk or talk. Radio talk. Yeah. Which one did you see? I want to. I want to see what's going on. Okay. Let me put it to you this way. I hope it is not the one that I saw. Well, I think it was because I wondered if I, you know, I have to listen to Steve Canem talk about this. I wonder if I had missed something because I left thinking as it was a great scene movie. Something that we'll see in the video story. About two weeks. Yeah. I don't know. Seriously. We got to have Cheryl come in here because we want to make sure the food arrives today. Okay. We'll even have a stand. Go pick it up. Sure. We'll see what we can do today. Okay. What? Well, that's what we want you to do. Floor is probably isn't even aware because Carmine may be in the Twilight Zone. It is a big holiday. But would you call him and just check it out? And we only want to just a whole bunch of stuff. You know, Zini and P.S. Sam, Miami, Pasta. Because Stan is here and he needs to be fed. He's been out of work for about two years now. Or order a week's work. And you know, I'm serious. You've got to look at her today. She's got, she's not hiding it. Is your mind okay. Now, if Cheryl's mom is listening, I do want to say this to you. We've been working on her. She'd ate very well on a Friday. She made a big point of that. And then over the weekend, must have slacked off because she looks like Karen Carpenter on a band day today. No, she's like, you're fumbling like you're fumbling like you're fumbling like you're private life. What is it like a child size you're wearing there? Oh, God. Yeah, mom's on a phone. Okay. Are you on her line with me? I'm still here. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I got emotional because I want to save that child. That's okay. She's feeding away. I hope I'm feeding away. I want to ask you a question. Does your room look similar to the room that can rate your child? Very much. In fact, in console, that he was using the little thing that's put the buttons with the phones. It's identical when we use. And the table was similar. His was a little bit bigger than ours. But that's kind of cool. That was fairly realistic. That part of it. Yeah. Yeah. But the way that the board-up was spinning around in circles and firing the car. There was Nick and Spinner out. Yeah. And he was like, well, he's got a wild football helmet and every five minutes. And throughout the way, the phone around your neck and throw a bunch of stuff. It's a little bit hard. Yeah. You don't have to take a stroll down there. No. But Steve is doing that now. I think that movie had an effect. He's got this new microphone like the, like the use for football game with the, you know, hands, arms, and stuff. I don't know what he's going to do with the hands, but we'll find out. I came out to see Saturday and it was a revelation because it all came together. Because what you say, it's only a radio show. That is correct. That's what I figured it out. Can I call my friend Brian to do this back? Absolutely. And good day. Okay. Well, that was a good call. We're short to the point. He got it out of his system. Did not ask me to do the name calling. It was terrific. It's 11 past noon at WIOD. There's an open line in date. If he moved very quickly now, 751 WIOD. And if you want to say hi to Stan, some of those old stand major callers. You're lucky to you. Okay. Now he's there. And he will be here through lunch at least. I think Don's listening. Don't have a phone. Were those pictures we were supposed to see Don? Better be nice to was Don. We'll set out those Don Johnson pictures. Hi, OLD. The number you have reached 656-6847 has been changed. The new number is 501-276-656-847-47-073. 113-9-8-6-458-3-5-5-7-16-0-4-276. Please make a note of it. Okay. Sounds like all of Stan's different numbers put together. 1215 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward. If you move real fast now, 524-946-3. Don't forget Steve has got an incredible show today. And it's about time. Girls who want to be heavyweight wrestlers. Chris DiMahoney, heavyweight wrestler at Cooper City High. She's only 14 to weighs 195. She could put up necklock on you at about 2. These kids today. Her coach Bob Wiss Nusky, who says the girls ambition should be encouraged. Tracy Porter, girl wrestler at Nova High. And Ron Schultz, her coach who does not support the idea of girls wrestling boys. Now, is this show tied into the one about crotch watching that he did come? Yes. This is a lot to follow up, right? Okay. It's 1216, our next call is in Hollywood. Hi, Neil. Hi. I just wanted to say hello when Helen trained for you, Cheryl. Thank you. And to stay high to bird and stand for me. Hi. I'm sorry. He has no. I just want to say hi to my son, Steve. And he's listening in the other room on stage. How old is Steve? About 36? No. He's 9. 9. And he's listening. Oh, that's right. Kids have offered school today. I wonder where we're getting such a silencing response. Yeah. Well, I just wanted to say hello. But what will happen? So hanging up now. You're a little nervous but nevertheless, no. You didn't see that movie, did you? No. Don't do it. All right. Okay. Unless you're really bored with your life, don't waste the time. No, I won't. Okay. Have a good one. The amazing thing is there's so many good movies out right now. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to kick myself when I walked out there. I felt compelled to see it. Because, like, for example, Tom Jick had just called me during the news. Yeah. And he was writing a big thing about it in the Sun Sentinel. And I had calls from where was it from that paper in Dallas? Well, I got to see why they would do it. Because the movie was based in Dallas. But, you know, see, it feels because it's about your profession that your compel to go see it. But I'm not exaggerating. It was so bad that you just boring and you're waiting for something different and it never changes. It never changes. How was it technically? Was it okay technically? No. It was horrible. I mean, technically I mean, it was, you know, they were. Oh, it was ridiculous. The board up is just before the break. He's slamming the card semester high shot. And he's spitting around in the chair. I think it's like that. You got my glasses. Oh, yeah. I guess I must have been paying off your John. With a pretty hat. Yeah. Now that I think of it, you know, John? Oh boy. Yeah. That's a real story in a half. Oh, he's a good guy. He's like I said, it's a story in a half. He's incredible. You're right. Super hyper. But this board up was like so, and he's throwing spit balls at the window. I mean, like one after another. And Eric, but go to the evening and look at that. I mean, he's busy wandering around in his psychotic frame of mind. And now he's looking at it. Oh, when he was at, you know, he throws spit balls. Yeah. Yeah. I try to ignore him when he does that. I just faced the back of the wall. Better than that than the bottle. That's something major here. I say that for Henry in the newsroom. This is probably the world weekly newsroom. I interrupt because this is so critical. Well, yeah. I misglen's newscast. I will do one for you right here because I really do. This is big. Authorities are warning office workers to the way where he'll be here in 20 minutes. Authorities are warning in a rum. But he's concerned about the food, okay? Authorities are. Warning. Authorities are warning office workers. You're going in a ruffling. You're telling that one morning time. To be aware of their swivel chairs because they might explode like a bomb. Yeah. Like that one over there. So far 25 people in England have reported that they were blasted from their seats when pressurized gas seat adjustment cylinders in the pedestals of the first. Now public service officials are cautioning unsuspecting secretaries to force sake their furniture if it starts acting funny. Now last summer you probably heard about the car. You're right about this in the hero. Last summer British police officer Bob Millson was blown two feet up in the air. Well, I'm sideways into some walkers when it's chair exploded under him in Bristol. Yeah. So you see why you had an epidemic of that. Okay, 20 minutes after you knew the Wildewyer here. The really impotent news first and let's go to Miami Beach. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. You know, no. You're funny. Lester. Lester. You're in the right. You can work information next week. Why are you screaming? Lester. You got wrong information. What do you mean? The right track is closed Sunday, but it's open all week. Do not close. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Okay. You just thought I got it right. I thought that's what all right. Always closed on Super Bowl day. The game, but open Monday. And be open Tuesday. Real. If the open for the whole weekend. They're running all over. Why do you tell me that because Roy Slant-Hoff would have a nervous breakdown. If I gave out some bum information. If you get the. Yeah, oh, yeah. I was looking for you. I was looking for you. You want? I was looking for you. Oh, no. I went to see that awful movie in steadiest of it. Yeah, I take advice. I'm not going to see it. The govt will skip it. Sunday program next week. Because of the Super Bowl will have a special Monday program. January 20th. I'm going to run straight through the whole week. Okay, excellent. Well, listen, you're a lifesaver because I would have made a real fool out of myself more so than usual. How are you doing? Making any money? I can't win a photo every time it's a photo. You know, my horse gets to look at the picture. Yeah. So I've been doing. I've been doing real good. I've been staying away. But I'm going out there next weekend. Both days. Are you going to kind of randomly in my son? I've been to Sunday. I can't lose any money. What's that name is blood care thing? Over here and now. What's that name? Old what's his name? The one that there's a patient out there. Alan Courtney. No. The one from the race track. The sugar. Bob Savage. Right. He's doing what? He's doing a broadcast. Well, that's good. I'm ready to make him some money. You want to use the bill? From what? Last year, what are you talking about? You just broke it from Goldstein. A couple of years ago? Bill and I did a show. That's what I made. That's right. One day next month in February. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. I'll see you there. They promised I'm going to have all winning tickets there. Oh, yeah. By the way, I see a guy waving a T-shirt with real picture on it. Really? Yep. Terrific. Was he tearing up all his tickets? I don't know. I was looking at a guy saying, that's real ruggish. I said, why? I said, me it all weird. No. Okay. I still want to ask him in a woman called. Good luck to you. I'll see you out there. Okay. That's green shirt. What a day. He's a good guy. He just turned up too many tickets and it's gotten to him. Has he ever called you before? Very rarely. A couple of times. A couple of times. It's amazing how we rehabilitated him. Seriously. When we went out there in the beginning, Bill and I, just this guy, was out of control. We were swearing and carrying on. I like to scream at the track, but not he was just getting a little bit carried away. A little bit. And we had a pretty fur. Oh, my. I'm not there in slapped him around a couple of times. And since that last just been great. Now he has that a couple of problems. He got kicked out of the track one time and barred for life. But he's a good guy. Really? I'll stop touting, Lester. Man, he has given me horses. He's a great guy. I don't want him to misunderstand. But he has given me a couple of stories. I mean, this one horse he gave me a quarter. And he has slept with his horse and with the owner. And he spent the whole night in his bar with his guy. And a guy is going to do the Jockey. And he always went in his horse and he always can't lose. Right now that horse is at the top of the stretch and is staggering to the finish line. Okay? It may make it or not. Are you going to the Super Bowl? No. Why? Because I'm going to sit in the comfort of my home and watch it. I'm not going to go out there in fight. And he's picking the bangles. The bangles. The bangles. It's because of that Suzanne a heart. She's so cute. So it's got to be the bangles. Don't you think? You know who you were. He's just trying to remind me of. Did you use our rein man? No. No. You haven't seen it. He reminds me of Raymond. No. Yeah. You're starting to move before. No. The bangles. He started to say everything two or three times. We think he's picking it up from Reniri. Well, that's awesome. I think now seriously. I think that we can quite an effect on it. Well, it's just like Steve walking around with that hand. I don't think they should be compared. Toyota of Hollywood on 440. Or you are nuts. You got this brand you highway out there and nobody's on it. You don't need to go on 75. We go to the airport. Maybe to the Naples here. God. How long have you lived here? You know, seriously. Seriously. How long have you lived here? That's obvious. You take 95 to the airport. That is correct. Oh. Aw. Man, he says head examined. Don't you understand when you got on 75. You go right to the pump. Wait a minute. First of all, it takes forever to get to the pometto. I mean, it's a long, long, slut from state road 84 to the pometto is forever. It's the same amount of time it would take you to go down the turnpike to 95 and then to the airport. Think about it. You're on that turnpike a long time to come down here. I'm not talking about the turnpike. I'm just talking about 95. Who the hell needs a turnpike? But if you're coming from play. There isn't any traffic on me. You can believe me. It's like your eight meals you're not even in the morning when I come to work even when there's rush hour in nine o'clock in the morning. It's only 10 minutes from my house to 95. But why would you take 95 to go to Miami International from plantation? It's 40 minutes. It's 40 minutes if you go on I 75 and there's no traffic. Oh, we were down your neck of the woods over the weekend. What were you doing? Down the candle. Went down to see a brother mom pick up an extra cycle. Oh, this is good. This is like real good. Over the back of the street. Here we go with this. This is losing. Are the food will be here any minute now. Trust me. We had to. What is that? The amazing thing about soft dixie highways and never changes. Nothing on soft dixie highway. You know, when we used to work at the US for Rails got that all straight. I never go on progress. I did not go on that. But the businesses that were down there like 10 years ago, they're still there. Even some of the restaurants, which is pretty incredible, they must be the worst restaurants in the world of the best to be able to stay in business like that. Are you going to have any of your system now? West Palm Beach, Chelo. Hi, Neil. Hi. This is Mark. Okay, Martha. I'm calling you. I just want to tell you my husband is a really big fan of yours. And he looks to see you every can see you get. Where do you live, Martha? In Lake Clark, Stewart. Lake Clark, Stewart? Yeah, it's a beautiful little area inside West Palm Beach. Inside West Palm Beach. Yeah. I knew there was something beautiful in West Palm. I didn't know what it was. Yep. Well, I have to come out over anytime. It is like it used to be, Martha. Well, I don't know. I haven't been here that long. Where are you from? From Miami. Oh. It's more beautiful than Miami. That's a short story. Yeah, no question about it. But Miami looks good this week. Man, it's super bowl. We've got all these tourists here. Now we want to put our best feet forward. All right. All right. Everybody just cleaned up our lawns. You got it. Yeah. Why do I tell you? He's listening to you right now because he's on the road. So it's one of the night. What's his name? His name is God. Oh, Don. Is Don on the phone? No, no. He's in the corner listening. Okay. Yeah. And we're frozen. Concerned. Jerry's still out on you, Neil. So it might help if he played. I can't see. Okay. In other words, it's a request, right? It's very quiet. It's not about having a nice day. Okay, bye. Yeah, I hope. Isn't it amazing how you can always do that. Yeah, so we're not going to do it. So we're not going to do it. So we're somebody else called. I might have played it between now and the end of the show. But we're just a sneaky way that she did that. You're going to go see back on that bit, by the way. About what? About to play it. No. From from Casey case. No. Nobody ever called and said that he knew that you were playing it. No. Where did you get it? Where did you get that? From the engineers at WNBC. Oh. Don't I miss it. Oh yeah, it's been on the ear in New York ten minutes. Yeah, and I heard someone called me from Atlanta last week said it's on the ear in Atlanta. Really? What is it? What is it? The yelling in Atlanta? I don't know. Well, didn't Casey chuck it or something? Didn't he retire somewhere? Yeah. He's got his own thing now. He's got crazy in that show. The American top 40. And that's when it came out. It was after he left and shadow Stephen's or somebody took over. Not Charlie Van Dyke. No, but he shadow Stephen's. Who's almost as nauseating as Charlie Van Dyke. Not quite. But do you believe the channel for is still using Van Dyke to do their promotion stuff? I can't believe that. After all, their big change and the big switch and all that crap, I can't believe for is still using the same guy to use their promo stuff. A guy from Phoenix. Here I am out of work. I could use the money. They use a guy from Phoenix. They use a guy from Phoenix to do their promotion materials and credible. Well, they're tough. I watch channel 5. Yeah, I do too. It comes in better now. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. There. Yes, sir. I wish I went to see Dork Radio. Dork Radio. Yeah. Oh, listen. Hold on a second. I'm supposed to a break now. You're not going anywhere, right? I'm here. What line are you on? Hold on. He's on three. I like to do that to him. They don't know what they want this. The streamer eat a banana. Okay. He's on three. Good for him. We have to ask a question, ladies and gentlemen, if you've ever been turned down for a loan, we could be. Yes, sir. Yes. And so they're La Magnana. Go to your brother. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I broke. He had a break. Well, does. Yeah. 1238 and WI-22 before one on his wonderful Monday. It's more Miami and Red Square. So, the major holiday was a good work. You work it out today. You work it out today? I can tell. Now, you volunteered to work today. He loves you. You had to work today. What kind of crap is that? I'll be damned. Well, I would lodge some kind of a formal protest. I think they're rest of the week off. Anyway, it's 22 till one. And Steve has got that grappling with young lady show. Yeah, they restlers. And you may even stick around for that. Are you bet? What do you mean Iceland? Hello. Hey, how's it going? Okay. Hey, Stan. Do you remember that show you did where you're only getting calls from Iceland? Iceland. Are you free? Greenland. One of those lands. Well, that used to be on M.E.X. and Boston. We used to get calls from Greenland all the time. How you did a show when you were on the show? Like they sent out against British Greenland. Right? Well, you did a show on the wins. Were you only taking calls from Greenland one? Yeah. Uh-huh. That's why Stan stopped getting calls. I kept telling them. They can't hear you in Greenland. He's no. Well, I saw a new story over the week and on CNN about Iceland. They're having a big problem over there with paper versus plastic bags in the supermarkets. They're one in charge people a dime for the plastic bags. And the consumers are all up in arms. Yeah. They passed a law. Did you know about that? Don't you try to put any ideas in the starting plant? No, I'm just trying to put in a few minutes. We can use it a moment or another again. Well, those ice-flanned stories, you know. Yeah. Yeah. Where are you calling from, sir? Actually, what's Palm Beach? I'm calling from. Oh, same different clothes. Yeah. I'm just joking. You know, just a joke. Listen, thanks to you. I won't go see that movie. You're talking to talk to a radio. Please. I won't go see it. But I will tell you something. You know that show that the dean was on. Why is guys? We got cracked over to school. Well, you know, I recorded that on my video. And what I did was, well, I've got two of them. And I kept recording that part over and over again. Where you got cracked over to school and you fall for it. You're a state of... It's the one I've got. New the dean alone. He died 10 years ago. Nobody told him. Just leave him alone. What I've got. And he's a great friend of W.I.O.D. I've got a four hour came. Lately, he was to leave him to Philly. I'm wrong play where he just... He just stood at over and over again. Hmm. And whatever. I think you ought to go see talk radio. Because I was saying before, if you really have two hours to kill him, you're terminally bored. And you'd be a perfect candidate. You know what I'm saying? You're going to take care of him. Okay. Another one of those great calls on his Palm Beach line man. It really brings up many times over. Greenland, that call. Yeah, right next to him. He found the legend spending that amount of time looking at Alan Burke's head. Right, he did. That's scary. Do we have... Two bell we don't have something on tape. You know? A little more. Something. Yeah. He was here. Of his voice. No. No. He wasn't here long enough. Although he did. I will say that he did mention a call that there's a couple of times, which is moving up in the world. Okay. I'm sure on CAU they probably say, you know, once a week Alan give those call letters. Not bad. See how you they don't care. Don't think? No. No. They don't have any numbers anyway. Oh, you know. He's following. You know, holding, right? And I said I'd come right back. And we're mucking around here going other call. I'm sorry. I want to go back on hold. No, no, don't do that. Listen, I saw you. I said, do a great deal. Yeah. And you know, within minutes, I knew the guy I was going to die. I thought no empathy for the guy. I knew it or you were hoping. I'm from. I mean, you could really hate the guy. Obviously, you know, the guy was sick. Didn't you get the feeling from the way some of the other people kept looking at him that some of the people inside the building wanted to finish the job off. Oh, yeah. You know, the scene with him in the basketball game. Here, nobody likes the guy. Who was listening to him? Yeah, that's what he's saying. I can't even say on the radio. When I asked you listen to that show that he was doing, you realize nobody could be listening. Except all those misfits that we're calling in. Yeah, that was, I found that fascinating. That the only people that would call in were the maniacs. Yeah. That there weren't any, any, minorly. He's a people. No, not a one. See, that's where lost all credibility. Error, re-single call was another sick character. Waco, drunk, heal Billy Redneck, douchebag, not see, whatever. I mean, always, it was like one person calling with a slightly different voice. I felt like I was underwater to the whole movie. I really felt like I was drowning. Yeah, I wish I would have been. I don't really. And I went with my wife. I was surprised that you didn't walk out in after the first half hour. Yeah. But, uh, listen to Rayman trivia. The, uh, in the scene in the restaurant where he's going to the phone book routine. Yeah. Got taken. That's his father-in-law. Why? His father-in-law's name is Got taken. Maybe he said, uh, what, what, what, what, what did he get up to? He got taken. Oh, I see. You see, ah, they always sneak those little cute things in there like Hitchcock used to do. Where he did those little cameos. He always got a sneak a little inside cramp in there, right? So all you trivia expert. Oh, look at that. The food is here, sir. And Andrew. I want a side tramp you, but the food is here. Sheros got arms full of food. There will be no ringman too. I'm starting to disappoint. No, I figured it is much. Not with those people. Look at that, that, that, that's all we have. What's going to have a great day. Wait, wait, wait. Remember, you can't beat that. You can't, you just can't did it. You're right. That's what they say in Tamarack. Right. Have a great, thank you, Sheryl. Thank you for being here. Some of this. It was, uh, see you later, pal. I'm up as enough. What? She's not going to eat any of it? She didn't take a thing. I was serious. I was joking. And there she goes up the hallway like, You're not going to get me to eat. We're going to tie you to a chair and a four speedy, Sheryl. Sheryl's mom is listening. She's not eating any of the food. And unless she gets back here in the next two minutes, we're going to do the whole rest of the show about her, okay? Because that movie that was on a couple of weeks ago, that was not the caring carpenter's story that was Sheryl's life stirrer. Oh, my God. I got a request. Yes. Yes. But it isn't for a bit. It's a request for a guy who called you last week. I'd like for him to call in again if he can get through. The guy who called you who worked on network with the, Oh, yeah. Because he said something and it went right by. Because you were thinking in terms of network. He said something. He worked on the Godfather. I'd love to have him call back. He was supposed to be a Toyota Hollywood did today. And I guess he never got by there. But I think his son, uh, stopped by and or some relative and said that he was coming by and never got by. He had some pictures that he wanted to show. Wouldn't you love to ask him some some questions about Brando and about the Godfather? I love, I will. Okay. All the power just went out there momentarily. We had a little hiccup here. Look at the, uh, look at that scream and that looks good. That's cool. Look how cool that is. I'll be damned. Look at that. Don't know is flying over the Midwest and that's green. Right? Yeah. If you run whole, would you try to control yourself if you're looking at the computer just went out? Okay. That gives us a good chance to dig into lunch now. We had a little power for you. All the lines went out. So if you're on hold, you'll have to call back. We apologize for that. 751 Wild and day. 524 Wild and Broward and you know the rest. Okay. Now what have we got here? Got my salad. You want us to make noise? Yeah. Make a lot of noise. This is like old time. Okay. Now, didn't I tell you we would feed you? Is that my any pasta? Oh. Oh. Look at that. The lights are flickering. Hmm. Holy Toledo. Look at that. That looks sensational. I'm going to count the olives to make Linda happy. Yeah. I think it's true. And a lot of olives in there. Now they're not a lot of olives. Here's one. A lot of olives. You got subs. And a big piece of thank you, Carbine. I'm saying no seriously. Those people up at four is have been so nice to us that it's incredible. Is that big ZD? Oh. See, we don't muck you around. Okay. This is where I saw a more functional operation like between that. Thank you, Carbine. Because I'm not big on subs. I love them. But if there's a big ZD around this. Yeah. For this, Andy Pasta. You're so incredible. Hmm. Hmm. Well, the amazing thing is a contrary to my last trip here. The food did come into the studio. Right? Oh, we got them every last time. I like that. They saw the book. Oh, yeah. By the way, you know, the whole book come in. The whole book should be here by now, right? Who's got it? Oh, look at those hourlys. I want to see what you do. Yeah, let's get that book in here. I'll see what you did for a little bit. I don't know. It's not here today, is it? No, I don't know. I know. What I've ridiculously hurt my emotional now. I really want to see the nine to ten. I'll tell you how spike is in terms of coming in. Even on Larry King's birthday, takes off. That's just Martin Luther King, even on Larry King, he takes off. You want to see the big nine to ten hour of the day? Yeah, I want to see what he does for a renery. I'll look at that. All lines lit up again. That I want to see what came does for Neil. What does that mean? How can you do that? Oh, you mean that two hour. Yeah, hourly. Well, go to the end. Yeah, who's got the book? Is Cheryl got the book? She's coming back in this direction. The door could be opening any second. Oh, boy, does this work? She's not coming in here. Oh. I thought she was bringing us the book. We have some food for her. Yeah, we got some food for you and here, Cheryl. Come on. Quick plan hard to get, okay? All right. Let's go to mobile on four. Hello. Yeah, Neil. I only broke down and saw a rainman this weekend. And loved it. Yeah. I'd like to just move. I'm going to. Made one mistake when I went to see it. I saw it in the theaters across from century village in Deerfield. Oh, wow. Come on. No better. Well, I should, but it was the earliest latent or the latest early movie I could find. But despite all of that, it was still very enjoyable. Even though they were complaining about not being able to see because the people in front of more two tall. Ha ha ha. They should have a special theater for those people. Yeah, I'm surprised they went at night. You know, it's full price. Yeah, the only time to go if you're going to see it or like that is to go up a very last movie. Yeah, late at night. Well, that was the mistake I made. Hopefully I'll learn from it. I'm doing stand. I'm doing great. Good. He's having a wonderful lunch here. Good. How do you know that? I'm really good. What's that floor is on the beach you got? No, not on the beaches on 79 Street. Just east of Biscant. Oh. You don't know for us? No, I was, I lived in North Miami. To know I'm living in Boka. For us as an institution here, sir. It's been here for like a hundred years. Hmm. I have to make it a point to get down there. Please. Good. Okay. I enjoyed the flick. Oh, it's fabulous. Don't see talk radio. I'll have to miss it. Okay. Thanks, Bill. If that's that this food is any indication he's going to be around another hundred. Oh, yeah. It's tremendous. All are stuff is great. There. Your time indices and your pizza. And it's time to talk about brick oven pizza. Okay, which is not a competitor. It's nowhere in the same area. And they don't even have the same stuff. Although they do have great baked Ziti. Oh, boy. And brick oven. Oh, God. I remember those wonderful days when Ray used to bring us all that food. Now we're pretty far. See, that's one nice thing about floors. It's right up the street. Hmm. And we're pretty far now. One very nice lady came by Toyota. How about 54. WI would do. We got a collar in four pairs. Hello. Hey, hi. How you guys doing? Great. I was just calling. No. I've been hearing it. You guys have talked a lot this morning about talk radio and all. I haven't seen it. We might sell off. And even though you, you, it's systemly, you know, telling people not to watch. I probably will end up going to see it. I don't know if you know it because when somebody tells you this, something goes through the opposite. Oh, yeah. I put a lot of people to go see it so they can discover that I was right. Exactly. And say that, you know, I know it was bad because I saw it. And not because, you know, I told me it was. But I was just curious, you know, since you said a lot of it was realistic as maybe some would hope it to be. I kind of, you know, I'm kind of skeptical myself if they can really make it look as realistic as it really is. You know, as far as, you know, talk radio is. And I think they did a good job on a good morning Vietnam. And it's far as, you know, how it is for, you know, radio broadcast or rather than a talk show. Well, but again, the good morning Vietnam was a fun, at least parts of it. Parts of it were very depressing. But parts of it were very funny. I mean, Rob and Williams is a hysterical guy. Oh, yeah. So he's entertaining. Yes. He's really. Roby is not entertaining in any way, believe me. I was, you know, curious because the guy doesn't I'm telling himself, it sounds like that was a good. No, he doesn't tell himself. Oh, he gets shot. You get shot by somebody else. Find another caller. My Uber afraid of anything like that happening. No. But not it, you know. No. It happens. It happens. You know, you don't worry about those things. Uh, but that's the thing. Well, I'm glad you took time out today. But uh, all right. Okay. Thank you a lot. Bye. By speaking of the good morning Vietnam, you guys to know that that happened when I was over there. What? And I had to take a TV crew out when this guy got transferred, called fired off of our radio's icon. I had, I went out and interviewing. Hmm. I was, he was something. I mean, he wasn't Robin Williams, you know, but he was very outspoken on what he said on the air. And, uh, there was a real shame the way that happened. It was one of those things where, you know, some officer didn't like him and got transferred out and everybody else suffered, you know. Yeah. Almost like what happens in this business, uh, normally. Why are you trying to save them? I've reminded you. Okay. Let's go to, um, Opalaka. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah. I got to agree with you on that top radio movie. You saw it. Oh, yeah. And you survived it, huh? I got to say the movie itself was okay. The realism wasn't there. I mean, it was totally fake. I did, I disagree with you. Forgetting whether it was realistic or not. I was just a total, um, I was a bit. But whatever was, it still wasn't good. It wasn't entertaining. There was nothing funny. There was nothing interesting. It was just the same thing. I started to get dizzy too. Those camera angles where he's been in the round the room. Oh, yeah. I would definitely take a couple of, like, set, and put him in your pocket when you go in there. It was outrageous. There was a waste of five bucks. Yeah. Five bucks. Yeah. Where did you see it? I'm a, where you pay him $3 per day in movie. Uh, in Pompano. And that obviously in Pompano, because the nice kind of, people who live there. That's what I paid to see Rayman. And I really want to we get after no early. Like this was a three-pipe. Okay. It's a three-buffing buck. I'm used to going at night. And they really get you. Yeah. During the week and after in three bucks. Well, listen, I guess that's it, huh? I was wondering, what are your engineers screwing up with the phones and stuff? What do you mean? Well, I got cut off before. No, we had a power glitch here. F.P. and I'll burped. Yeah, everything went out and it was real exciting. Oh, I listen. I have a good day. I gotta say I love that protec condom thing you do. Oh, yeah, that's coming up any second now. That and the thing with the phone numbers before. Yeah. The operator that was actually one of you. Uh-huh. I have a nice day, Neil. Oh, yeah. Here, I'm fumbling around and trying to reach full. These guys come up with the most, uh, I know. Yeah. Backhanded ways of making requests that I've ever heard in my life. Yes, what? What? This isn't cut up. Either it's not cut up or the pot is closed in there, but you can't blame it on Mike Spendell. Uh-huh. Now, don't go pick it on Mike. Okay. And now we're going to run short a time to play this, okay? So save it. Is it possible that it's not cut up? Because it would not cut up. I didn't do it because there's no reason to stop it, okay? Does that mean that we had Gremlins in here again over the weekend? Is the card pot open? No? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, geez. Okay, that was the problem. The pot was closed. Now it's got a few. Why was it? Why would that pot be closed? Oh, from the power thing. Oh, yeah. Ah. I wonder if it's a clock. I guess you'll have to wait till after the news, okay? So hold it. Sounds good. You can till after the newscast. Okay, pal. Got an open line in date now. 7.5.1. 9.46. 3.75.1. W.Y.O.D. Is that enough food for you now? Oh, it's fantastic. And it got the same way. Oh, boy. It's fantastic. I'm going to take it to the rest of the pizza home. I got my any pasta salad here and the cereal didn't come back. Cheryl never came back. She really on it and it wrecks sick thing because she was standing in the, no, seriously. She was standing in the window and she had her finger down or throw down or where elbow. And I thought, geez, if your mom hears about this, she's going to really get upset. And then she ran kind of like downstairs. So I don't know what she's doing, but we've got to straighten her out. Anyway, our very own April war, the misunderstanding by with a 1 o'clock W.Y.O.D. News. Don't forget Steve will be along as always from 2 to 6 and Steve has got to show all you horny guys out there, my little boy. Young girl, wrestler. You're not talking about glow. This is high school wrestler, real. And these are girls who want to wrestle with boys who may even give out some phone numbers. Oh, that's coming up at 2 on a Steve cane show. I sure do. They're eating. Let me do it. Try to pick up more fat, rickly, go off the mic. You're opening it back. Yeah. What were you saying? What were you saying? And you got up. Were you pleased? What were you asking? It's caught him with a mouth full of food now. Come on. What do you want? Now that the mic's opening clamped up. You were talking about those stations, and so I'm familiar with that. Oh yeah. The old sports station. You know what you want to talk about? Oh boy. Anyway, one of what they said about W.Y.O.D. Our final hour here on a Monday. It's zip-bobbid. Bigger hand. Well, thanks for the food. No, bye. Nice seeing you. What did I do with my spot? I don't understand. I'm so confused. You don't need coffee. You don't need coffee. I'm confused. Anyway, I'm fine. Let's move right back. What do we got on the board here? We got an open line in day. That's pretty exciting. 751 W.Y.O.D. And the only other line on the board that's open right now. Guess what it is. What could it be? Uncle Neo. Okay. How many guesses do you want? I couldn't be. North of Broward. Not Broward. Not Broward. Not Broward. I bet they. They have that one in day. Could it be? Long Beach. Long Beach. 655 W.Y.O.D. If you move real fast in Palm Beach. For Lauderdale. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. How are you? Good. That's nice about that movie. Rainmen. I thought it was terrific. It is. So really enjoyed it. What you were someone in the call or said something about the ending? They didn't like the ending or something. I didn't see that. And several of the callers who live in fantasy land, they called it. And they wanted, you know, some kind of emotional reunion or they wanted. Broward. And Hoffman to become normal. I don't know what they wanted. They just have seen too many Alice in Wonderland movies. I guess. Well, I thought a little bit about that and talked to several people. The movie could have ended where they got together. Actually it probably should have. Why? Why? The movie itself would have had the effect that it did the way the ended it. There's no way in the world. Those two couldn't get along. A million dollars. You could hire the best help in the world. See what I mean? I guess you don't. Anyway, did you go to race in Saturday? Very good timing. Sir? No. Oh, you didn't go? Perfect. Very good race. Good.
