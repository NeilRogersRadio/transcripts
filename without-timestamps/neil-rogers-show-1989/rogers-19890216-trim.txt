Will you IOD for this? Neal Rogers. Begin in touching talk. Call 751-WIOD in date. 524-WIOD in Browards. Or 655-278-WIOD in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers. I'm not necessarily those of the stations. And now, here's Neal Rogers. On New Stock Radio 610-WIOD. Let's go. The real question is, how can a couple of WIIT-UP talk to you? Just a little bit here on the area. I really wonder about that. I have the trends I'll speak for themselves. I'll look at that later on. I didn't hear that, because I don't listen to that station any more or less not in the morning. morning and at the waist of not too many others do either. Our horses of Gulf Stream yesterday are still running in fact they're in a maturation now at the top of the stretch and here they come. 90 years young that was the bird's horse in the sixth race went off as six to five chalk and ran a desperate seventh. I mean desperate he never made a move if the chart is accurate. My horse not too much better in the fourth race Jeff striker's brother B.L. striker went off as a two little over two to one favorite and ran a desperate fifth. Not that bad though he was about the little over two legs behind for the whole thing so that's not so bad. But the 90 years young I guess he probably shouldn't relate to running in hell and they are that's probably what did it. At the anyway I got a story for you I had three of the most incredible hours yesterday speaking of hell and they are that you could ever imagine. But even if you've got your morning newspapers and your brandy articles you still even if you heard stevia today when I called in twice in Norm Kent called in we got into this again on the air you still only have a part of the story so let me just take a few minutes to try to lay it out if I can say that. Yesterday Norm Kent called in what was it a little after noon. Well I could one last hour one o'clockish very spabbard now don't say that please we got enough problems already. So anyway Norm Kent called and I guess was after one and he said that the hell and they all thing was off that they had had an emergency meeting and they came up with another resolution to say to table a whole business and they also by the way called off this coming Tuesday's meeting just for your information. And what I didn't realize when he called in and I found a little bits and pieces of this is that they went on was that the reason that they gave especially sunny rose in Berg for calling off the meeting was because of the threat of violence by my listeners if the meeting went on Tuesday and we showed up over there. I guess Sunny's got a bad memory. Either that or we think everybody else does because two years ago when we did that thing in March at the diplomat Mall of our on Helendale Beach Boulevard we had thousands literally of people I think there were two three thousand people I showed up all together during a four-hour show. There wasn't any violence all of my listeners acted very very well there was only one person who was creating a disturbance and that was some old Helendale Farts some nasty rotten douchebag who is a yelling obscenities homophobic obscenities at me in yelling obscenities at my mother which was very charming but other than that everybody was under best behavior but this is a nice excuse to try to get out of this thing rather than admitting that they made a mistake and that where they were being used and manipulated by our attorney friend from Coral Gables rather than doing that it was much more convenient than face saving for them to say well we want to avoid letting them turn this into a circus but at any rate they allegedly were dropping a whole thing so that's where we left it. I leave here I go home out in a backyard with a puppies by the way we're trying them outside without the leash or anything now just to see and they were just fine and all of a sudden the phone rings and it's Sharon. Well now I take that back there were a couple of the reporters from the newspapers who were wanting to call me at home for reactions and comments and I had had a couple of calls then the phone rang and it was Sharon and she said you're not going to believe this but one of the reporters tells me that this thing is coming on glue that there's more to it and then I called Norm Kent and all the reporters start calling again and comes to find out that may or Rosenberg tried what Norm Kent calls an end run around the rest of the commission okay in other words for public consumption they put this whole shenanigans on his meeting and they said okay we're dropping everything we're not sending any letter to the FCC we're getting uninvolved from this thing and we want to make up and let bygones be bygones which quite frankly I didn't know there was any problem with Helen Dale until a week ago Tuesday because other than the two or three bits we play on the air just like the ones we play about Tamarack and High Lee in any place other than that we don't talk about Helen Dale I mean if it comes up naturally I still got my comments but we haven't had any running thing going but Bing thin skin which is one of Mayor Rosenberg's most serious problems in life he just can't cope with the fact that you know we might poke fun at him and his city over there at the Sacred Cal of Helen Dale the city of choice So naturally I immediately called Steve on here this was a little after the four o'clock news and you know unleashed what was going on and this began a barrage your phone calls going back and forth and all around him and I want to say this I don't want to mention any names because I don't want to put any of these people in a compromising situation but the reporters were very very cooperative okay and they have seen finally they have seen through what all of this is all about very clearly okay so all of the parties involved had really better government themselves accordingly because you know as I said a week or two ago the worm has turned man and she was on the other foot nobody is fooling anybody anymore with his hate campaign so as we were best able to piece it together this is what Sunny Rosenberg intended to do he was going to take the resolution that was passed two years ago in 87 and send that to the commission which would have been still a way to have his own way in other words avoid letting us come and speak next Tuesday avoid letting the audience come and speak in opposition and still manage to try to interfere with my job in this radio station just out of personal vengeance well finally at about a quarter after six I get a call from another reporter saying and you'll notice it's in the newspaper today briefly because they had to keep putting these articles back together you know it doesn't times based on the way things were changing in three hours but Mayor Rosenberg told us reporter that well he's decided he's not going to send out any letter to the commission and he's not going to be coming to fall in this but he just he was wrongly under the impression that that's what the other commissioners wanted well strangely enough well listen the same reporter spoke to all the other commissioners and they all said that's not what we wanted at all including the city manager yeah what they all had agreed to and discussed and what they wanted was to drop this and get it over with and go on with the important business that they're supposed to be taken over there in a city hall and they'll but the sonny who's just got this burning axe to grind man who just can't let go of it he was going to try one last time and we you know and the word leaked out see if the word wouldn't leaked out he'd have probably tried to get away with that mm-hmm now the amazing part of it is a norm called a steve on the area yesterday and he read me the resolution and the amazing part of it is this resolution was passed when we were at WINZ that's right okay it doesn't even mention the call letters it doesn't mention my name but it says there is a station in a community that doesn't conform to such and such standards it's a long convoluted piece of mong that doesn't mean anything but the bottom line is if he would have sent that to the commission it would have been absolutely would have been astronaut it would made him even more embarrassed than he probably already is because it hasn't got anything to do with WINZ how do you like that credible for stupidity okay so if it makes you feel better sonny you can continue for public consumption going on with these idiotic statements about the fact that you don't want us to come and turn your city commission meeting into a circus I think you guys already do a good enough job of that every week but you know if that makes you feel better go ahead and say it you're not fooling anybody because our people have always acted like ladies and gentlemen your people over there are the ones who become apocalyptic and behave like juvenile homophobic jackasses okay so the bottom line is there's no meeting Tuesday there is no action anymore by the city hall and day they want to kiss and make up which I didn't know that we had anything to kiss about sonny doesn't want to kiss maybe make up but not sure no I don't think so no I don't think sonny wants to kiss he's afraid of my catch something now it's in the paper this was it is that what it was at it is that what it was I think they spelled it backwards I think fit was the word I think it was sonny who had the fit I think that that's where they became a little bit confused but anyway so that's where we are now I think that the audience deserves to know but I yeah you know it doesn't really boil down a being a victory of sorts it's just that finally uh these people came to their senses and I heard some of the discussion about some of the discussion I went on the background are they knew that they had been had and that they had been embarrassed and humiliated again but they just didn't want to admit that publicly so here comes Sonny trying to say well gee we don't want them coming over you're turning it into a circus and he can claim a victory but we're just not going to allow our government to be disrupted the bottom line is if they would go ahead and act like adults instead of like a petulent bunch a little children we wouldn't have these problems in the first place because I'll go about living our lives I think Sonny's quote was he didn't want some clown coming over turning the fitty commissioner meeting into a circus and now what he said talk about the pod calling a kettle blood so that's where we are these are the hallendale and of course there's an interesting and it is a legitimate news story because it's in all the papers again this morning there is an a paragraph at the end of the story in the harrowed by Don Van Addet the headlines as avoiding mess hallendale halts suit with or snipped with Rogers and the last paragraph says and this is really classic okay these cities decision to back off just proves my point Thompson said Wednesday this is our attorney friend and corral gables now that the city has withdrawn the agenda item it is just proof that the methodologies by Rogers to use his electronic bully pulpit are effective in quote okay so I guess I'm a bully huh bully he's that's coming from someone who is conducted a witch hunt for the last 19 months against me on three different radio stations who has instigated investigations in a by everybody but the CIA but I'm a bully yeah now that the war is turning there are some people who just can't deal with it okay and other people are beginning to unmask all of this and because it's a legitimate news story we're not able to discuss it fully and freely they can't cope with that and I I've been saying that to all these high priced attorneys for the last two years now that if we could bring ourselves to a point where we could discuss this and let the public you know our listening audience are the biggest ally we've got out there in a thorough where of what's going on they're not going to sit still for it now and we continue to receive just loads of mail here and to the fact I guess we have to give the fact number again should wait boy I saw a stack sure hand this morning that when the fact machine readable seven night it was letters seven five seven seventy five six ten is that fact number seven five seven seventy five sixteen for anybody and everybody except that idiot Wendy okay if Wendy still wants to write love letters to Steve she's gonna have to use you know like a postcard or 20 pages of state well now speaking of that this will be of concern to Wendy she'll want to know this oh yeah California state senators introduced a bill that would ban the electronic equivalent of junk mail unsolicited transmissions that tie up facts machines in waste rules of expensive paper notes is what Wendy has been doing yeah and they can put a trace on that thing just like they do on the phone can they oh sure find out where it's coming from which you know I don't want to start getting into a big thing with Wendy whoever she is but we'd like to keep it open for more important things if she knows what I'm talking about okay all right let's do a little break and it will get the show started and get officially on a road here at 10 p.m. do my regards to the Neil Rogers telling that I've never heard a smudger program in my life 21 past 10 at W. I.o.d. now we have something that Sharon brought in that's going to just make new hair grow on your head you're not going to believe this well yeah you could use out time and me too it's a little book okay and it was written in 1922 a little in fact look at the pages man it looks like my dog got a holder there does and the name of the book is from the ballroom to hell the lure of the dance oh and it's a how many pages this got about a 65 page book about the e-holes of dancing okay and it's written by TA Faulkner and he's got a little hand written note in the front of the book now this is legitimate okay it says this book is dedicated to the memory of Mr. T and the Hallendale City Council what what yeah trust me not the Mr. T that well I wonder which Mr. T it could be yeah wonder but anyway here it is TA Faulkner a former dancing master proprietor of the Los Angeles dancing academy in president of the dancing master's association of the Pacific coast and uh oh brother it's just incredible about the satanic exhibitions of dancing and maybe we'll just read some of this later if things get a little bit slow mm-hmm now talks about how the um dance has started out very slowly and then they kind of accelerate into these horrendous nasty satanic events like dirty dancing like dirty dancing I think that's probably way ahead of his time he probably had that in mind foot loose is about that he says I challenge you preachers in Sunday school superintendents who have enough moral courage to display the dangerous signal and take a firm stand against the dance evil especially those of your number who themselves engage in this form of lustful pleasure um thus making you desire a desirable asset and direct ally of these vampires who keep the brothels replenished from your churches to so seeds of corruption or allow them to be sewn in your midst and not just reap what you have sewn rich worldly fruit pardon the expression which will in time be plucked by the virtue of destroying monster prostitition what so I think this probably good maybe they can do on one of those uh TV tabloids shows we know want to mention a name is but maybe I want to have big exposés maybe you're more a pupa could do one of the shows yeah on the evils of dirty dancing which leads to prostitution yeah in fact I understand her all is gonna show on the next Tuesday so uh we may have to read this on the ear to try to save all of our wayward listeners in the audience okay let's give the numbers out and see if this audience is alive that I have my doubts in date county 751 W i o d we have an open line there and in Broward 524 W i o d bo can del rate 2789463 and in Palm Beach which I think we went almost the entire show yesterday I could be wrong but we didn't have to make sure that we have Palm Beach now maybe one or two from out of town but that was about it 655 W i o d 655 9463 we got a mobile on five but you notice Roger I did not rush to the mobile because uh we've got

time to go through that whole story about what took place yesterday because it's obvious it's a listening a tremendous amount of comment and enthusiasm like I said the quick burnout of the audience has never been more evident that it has been during these past four days now man it is just incredible it's like I want to give us something no maybe we should try the case on the area you know the case with the officer who shot the I guess Steve did that yesterday uh and she's anyway let's go to a mobile and palm beach hello hello Neil I do okay never call just for enjoy your show and you have my full support I have to give you a Canadian story about two months ago I'm driving north down on the tram bike listening to your story and you just happen to be talking about French Canadians as I pass a trucker there is a car backing up on the tram bike I had to do a curio went like dala flue or so to speak to avoid it all I could see dala flue or what's he one of those hockey players who skate side saddle sir wasn't something like that anyway I had to do a abrupt turn as I was on two wheels doing a curio went around this French Canadian and uh so to speak it was just pondered yeah

name vinegar something like that what's a nice Italian guy doing with a Canadian flag that's the question uh Miami hello there yes sir it's good oh well since I called but I got some of the interesting to tell you well I sure hope so because you'd be the first one I'll guarantee you that okay uh you know the i95 song yeah I saw the live last night oh August Campbell or whatever you have

idiots on the morning over at that other station yes sir you missed a couple of great comments somebody told them you know but um well I got called up the only good thing they said was sure happy it's Thursday you know it does initials all right yeah okay have a nice day okay get a life all right 10 28 and Wild we have an open line in date things are starting to pick up just a little bit we don't you know expect too much here today but uh get with it will you play 751 9463 and a Palm Beach line of course is still as dead as a door nail which is comforting it's good to see that they're not getting overly distraught in Palm Beach 655 Wild 655 9463 and they've been I guess they want to suck us into some kind of an on the air battle with them over there at Zeta and we're delighted to give multiplicity that they want we give Joey all the publicity you could ever give anybody in a course he's been off the air for a buddy year now and uh I don't know what to say I mean just they they're show sucks that's a bottom line capretis still we think a good guy all on the freight he's gonna get he's gonna get pressured into joining that you know when you're in the army yeah when you're in the army man when you're in the military they just a pressure you went doing a lot of things they brainwash you and what they're doing does it's called bating in the business well understand the kernels are master at that bating but that's another straight for another show but anyway they're just uh getting apple plucking another not just attacking you they're attacking me that's where course we're just a couple of washed up tacos just what did you hear that with your own ears yes I did wow why are you listening why had a radio accident oh did you now um we had a report that to Metro that yeah radio acts which is where we seem to be so many of them in this town yeah but uh well that's good to know that we're just walked up because I'm anxious today as the 16th and eight days it'll be the 24th a week from Friday the new week from tomorrow's matter fact right trend will come out and I want to say this publicly okay if the kernel breaks it too in the morning it will be one of the great miracles in the history of broadcasting okay because I don't think he's gonna do it the trends will stand by them so they lost half of our morning show audience over there in in six weeks yeah six weeks they went from a five five to a two eight which I must commend them on that because it hasn't been duplicated very often on history of the business I've never seen generally you can lose most of the audience but it takes a while they like it's like dropped off the face of the earth and I know we're washed up but it's amazing that we're over here making all of this money with these gigantic numbers and all these young demographics and they're over there sucking a big one it's a data and that amazing envy and jealousy is what I know come on yes envy and tell away and they will take the mobile on a Palm Beach line are you I don't want to interrupt in a hurry to do that yes really hello are you doing okay I knew this is gonna be a great call sir gonna be one I'm telling you right now how are you Glenn go ahead sir I'd like to give me a warning it's very it's very well no wonder you interrupted yeah I knew it was a great call I had about a psychic thing on you doing Barry good you enjoy your nomination uh rainman is my pick okay nobody's talking about it at all yeah I got a few of said because Pumpkin had didn't get uh huh you know I got to tell you something about the yes sir you don't realize but there were a lot of things going on behind the scenes on your behalf which resulted in the action that was ultimately taken now the only question I have to ask you is this if the end result is what you wanted to accomplish does it matter what means to accomplish that end results were utilized to get there oh absolutely when a mayor tried to do a dvs and run like that I mean you got to understand that would never have been accomplished if that if that little piece of information hadn't slipped out to some of the reporters and if the city clerk hadn't had a little slip of the tongue I have a feeling that the illustrious mayor would have gone ahead on his own unbeknownst to anybody and carried out with that plan that was my feeling he might have done that but I can assure you as a personal friend of the city attorney that a lot of stuff we're going on behind the scenes to end the fiasco good and at least the end result was taking care of and uh uh hope oh I'm delirious I'm very pleased that it's taking care of because it's embarrassing it's silly and it's also dangerous when when people in government allow them so you know it's one thing when some douchebag out there you know in a community it doesn't know any better it's a con by someone who's trying to conduct a witch-a-bow when people in government start jumping on the bandwagon because they're hearing things that they like and somebody's whispering a sweet nothings in their ear that sound appealing then you really got a dangerous very very pleased that the sainer mines prevail you're welcome at despite some of the uh outrageous statements and settlements coming out of there there were some uh sainer heads and cooler heads that ultimately prevailed after some uh cacholing over the telephone by some friends of yours and glands et cetera that uh I'm glad it worked out well for her okay thanks a lot pal take care about a good day long land okay but hey well we just broke a record for the week ladies and gentlemen it's only 1032 we already had a call on a Palm Beach line it was a good call it was a mobile so we really have done it already we might as well go home right he just use that line because it was because you can get right true and you can do that again it's only open one now 655 wio d 655 9463 you're not gonna finish your sentence or what was I said that's what they asked bundy to you right anyway I want to tell you about every low d 1037 a wio d I want to tell you one thing you know and I said this all consistently during this week I have since we've been here which is what 15 or 16 weeks I've never seen anything like this I mean these people are like so out of it now it's like nothing that you tell them or nothing that's going on is of any consequence well we went into the break every line was let except Palm Beach and I like three four people are dropped off okay so if you want us to go back to heavy topics we can bring in we can do a portion today all right we can do that for you in fact the show is already turning into one so we'd be delighted to do that but I just I'm in shock at the way these people are it's like wow we did that other stuff last week what do you got new for us this week okay or second time I get us a new toy a two-up at lines in Broward 524 wio d the Palm Beach lines are well not way I won't even dignify them by wasting my breath okay four-laterdale hello I'm not too sure pal well I can gradually you cannot work out let me just I think those guys that say they've got a real point you know what I think we're washed up I think it's getting pondered the communities burned out again we got to have something something a little more shocking for a mokie like coming and doing the show in the nude like a rollo we're saying like that that would be fine I haven't listened I haven't talked to you in three years I just got back to Florida I'm here in big case right to listen to you all the time here the first talk talk show hotel but listen to and uh I went crazy trying to find you on the radio when I got here on Q&A called up to you I didn't see what even you went crazy trying to find it I mean it's not that it's it's a great show but it's not that important is it oh I enjoy it well that's great I enjoy rocky road ice cream too but I don't go crazy if I can't have it you know well I call that WIN Z you know you don't know who you're talking about we don't know who that is oh come on yeah they only listen every day yeah we want to say hi to all our friends over uh WIN Z and Z last day because

am but I get to turn that way you were from the weekly you really yeah one of those okay try to straighten your wrist out pal well we're trying but everything worked out is there anything we can the ball stop you are the writing situation well just writing those letters is important to my Disney is the important thing we want to although I have my dad to move out of tremendous response don't get me wrong but it's like it like Peter's out because you can't keep the attention of the people in this town more than for a few days and then all of a sudden it's like on to you know bigger and better things you know whatever happened to go farther he just got a job in New Orleans oh yeah okay he's been out of the mark I mean he's been living here but he's been out of the business for a year and a

racer and a score card will keep you posted okay okay welcome back five ten forty a wio d we have an opening and brown now if you move like a snail five two four wio d five two four nine four six three now really is perplexing I one thing I've always said and I continue to say to you I will never figure this town out I can never begin to understand what motivates you people out there because you know we could be in the middle it could have a hurricane surrounding the building I don't mean like one of the football players I mean like a legitimate real hurricane and it would be like well this is exciting but how about the early bird at Papa next today what do you think they got the n I mean I just don't understand and I mentioned this the other day to about the difference between the people of north and the people of this state is there's no passion here I mean when it comes to heating they got a lot of passion but that's about the only thing they can whip up a good passion for is eight but like anything else it's like well we don't want to be bothered we can't hear to get away from all of the you know that kind of crap okay God all mighty why don't some of your people wake up and live already we have an opening in bokeh two seven eight wio d and Palm Beach goes without saying Miami hello hello yes sir I need a hyper all right what do you sound so depressed for oh no I'm

usual pattern and that is that no matter what I talk about the beginning of the show they avoid like to play they don't want to you know shock me by responding to anything that I say well that reminds

what I did the first 20 minutes on the show when I went through the rundown of all that sinister deception and crap that went on yesterday these are exactly the kind of colors you expect when you're dealing with brain dead mung brains okay there's an opening in date that's dead county two of now they're going out as I'm speaking okay 751 Wiod 7519463 this is incredible I think I think there's some put-up calls you I don't want to suggest that any of these TV shows you know can try of any of this cut for a few put-on the air I will far be it for me to suggest that but I just have this sneaking feeling and a pit of my stomach that this is like a little setup chop anyway if you're sick of schlepping your Wiod why are you canceling all out of a letter no Dorothy brought those by from the newsroom I got some wood little circle I can tell brought us by a wooden a few wooden nickel and actually they fill out a Henry's pocket when he was on a floor doing the 11 o'clock news I don't want you to Henry to have wooden nickels okay all right let's go to Miami next hello hi I heard hey how you doing alright I want to see torch song trilogy last week yeah and they had a 10 minute spot before the movie on golf stream did you know anything about those no yeah 10 minutes dot spots that this I don't know if it's only if it's only move it theater at all the sentiments it was I haven't general I haven't seen it with general cinema I think so it was either general cinema or uh let's great did you go out to golf stream and plunge your brains out well come on I've got a spread it around pal what that you got a spread it around yeah know what you mean hey oh I dog say also last week I was watching channel 7 and they had a commercial for shelves on there was the first time I thought well there's they're finally bouching up a little over here next door they're getting with it and in fact they were finally getting with it I don't see Bill Ross over there anymore I think that's probably an indication that things are getting a little bit uh you're a little more realistic over there I mean Bill was a wonderful guy but you know when they had a prop him up to do the weather it would be a little bit difficult also can we send any kind of like a Walter Cronis of channel 7 also uh do you know what they talked about the different heterosexuals talked about on from a heterosexual heterosexuals like I knew for you pal that's the first for him huh a trans sexual wouldn't that wouldn't that be that would probably get about an 80 share because I don't think the robbers had any heterosexuals on for months now now you're right I mean the trans sexual what about him sir what about him well that they had a woman on there who was started as a woman yeah yeah I'm in the right and then she said that she was working out with wait since she didn't like the way her body or his body looks so she's body he was his body oh yes for the trans sexual can work yeah these are the ones who changed their mind well then then the woman or the man who became a woman yeah got married got pregnant and then wanted to go back to a man what a show yeah I'll probably if you like just keep it when if you keep on on the wall you know on a hook just in case you want to type back on or something probably a good idea well when I was making the delivery the other day I saw an old part uh at a bus stop yeah and right next to her had to happen to be right by the road a water puddle and I couldn't help myself oh yeah yeah yeah shame on you so I was I was I was I was shame on you in thinking of you and so I went right through it and black that's terrible but I would like to have been here to see it okay you have a good day now all right bye bye okay now next thing they're gonna be saying why are we saying he's encouraging people to splash water on old people 27 past 11 I don't really see where it makes a hell of a lot of difference in many of the cases because where there's no sense there's no feeling anyway uh do we do Miami yeah let's go to plantation hello hello you're Davey right yes I am okay well I'm glad you know where you are so that's a good start yeah my name is also Neil I'm with Southland Kenos and there's an association called regap R E T A T yeah which stands for retired grayhounds as pets really people can vote can contact any of the local tracks well the organization isn't synced he does very flarada so what you're thinking what you've been producing about putting grayhounds to sleep unnecessarily it's not true what do you mean it's not true anyone that wants a grayhounds well well wait a minute we've got two different two different stories I'm delighted that you give us the information but when you say it's not true it is true they gasped them by the thousands that's not true it is true even the trainers have told me that I had to miss no matter and one of the poor things that the industry has to overcome that's not true and you'll accept it from someone that makes it living in the school well you know it's gonna be interesting you said that because I've seen reports on it on television I've talked to all kinds of people including the last couple of days you're the first one who says it's not true I'm not just sorry to put those to sleep that's in you may why would anybody do that because there are a lot of people out there that are crashed and just into the money and when they'd have no use for many more than they were in it rid of them now then they turned these dogs over to dissociation well okay I hope you're right and we'll check it out but I have a feeling we'll get some contradictory information okay I absolutely absolutely I absolutely guarantee you what I'm telling you is Amazon don't don't go into it with a negative okay okay didn't think he's very good you want to give you my number off the end well we'll check it out thanks a lot but 29 past 11 at Wildy it sounds encouraging but I just a little skeptical I'm best okay possibilities is broad food it's in the cafeteria downstairs so you can now see we have an interesting dilemma because Rich has got a smile I smirk on his face I am not going to participate I will not touch any of it just like I didn't touch any of the stuff that came in yet well I had a little that corn bee part of that sandwich what I didn't touch any of that and I'm just I can't participate now you shouldn't either I don't want to influence your embarrass or humiliated or degrade you but if you touch it I will I'll do the entire rest of the show oh it's it's also low calorie salads and more so they brought some salad you can go down there and check it out why don't you go a dig through it now because if you don't it'll all be gone we want to go guarded for me would you know just want to get into it and bring some stuff up and we'll like it out but I'm not going to touch any that pasta we thank our friends at pasta abilities and for a lot of Dale and we already know ahead of time their food is fantastic because they brought a many times before but I'm just I can't do it I got my new trip system I got my tomato soup here and my stuff and
