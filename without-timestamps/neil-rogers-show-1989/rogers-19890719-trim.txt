Ashford Massachusetts They charged 49-year-old Sean Griffith with unlawful possession of a bushy tail rodent He just he was described as a loner who lives at a local campsite He was irate and combat as when officers pulled him over and told the cops that the squirrel always accompanied him Because he was his friend. Yeah, please report that the squirrel who was tied to the wiper by an island In joying was frightened but not hurt by the unusual auto trip I gotta remember that he said it was nothing compared to how it when he puts him into watch the laundry on the dryer One nineteen to wio d let's take a call from these calls today I This has been real a real eye opener for me all of it is Monday and we never gave it up or so And they're all filled up which is a big deal.
