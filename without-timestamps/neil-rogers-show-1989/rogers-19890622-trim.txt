they'll have to wait cross-pring hello wait a minute hold on alright let me try this okay let's try it now yeah that's better wow okay I thought that I caught the tell on yesterday as part of your show where you're talking about i and d rating yeah let's I got them all here again let's go back out there yeah I heard you comparing them to the motivation station which is pretty bad what were the ratings i and z yeah pretty bad well no the thing I was talking about yeah if you'll listen if you open yours and listen and midday 25 to 54 demographics that's the age group but w i and z didn't make the list and on the bottom of the list was the motivation station with a 0.6 so that means that i and z was under a 0.6 under hmm that's pretty bad the motivation station i listened to them the other night all if you I know that you like new system that have they got a diet for you they say that um they call it's a balancing your food or something if you like a lot of butter on your toast in the morning and try a little less sourdressing on your salad at once yeah that's the point that's the motivation station yeah that's why they got well they actually did show this time for the first time in three months and i and d didn't not in midday okay that's all I want to know thank god okay well I'm sure it'll make everybody feel a lot better knowing the w i and z which maybe kicking ass into the homies is uh dad like they should share the billboard with zeta they should have both of them on the tune together what a great idea hmm i mean when the motivation station and kt beat you god who else did i want to mention again probably we should go over love 94's numbers one more time those are beauties yeah and there were a couple of others in here like a morning show on zeta with a 1.5 mm they're doing it now they are doing it we can't say what well listen we got a couple of lines on this board here and i realize we haven't given the numbers out yet but that's getting pretty disgusting one in brown one in pombiech and the rumbling starts again next door we're not gonna have another one of those days are we i she likewise the comment was if this starts again come see me the only problem is he's never here well i will tell you i said when you and i blew up i screamed at Gary Bruce i did i could all in a row just started again just i was in the middle of the head and in there just started again and now it now it's amazing part of it is he's been working in their monday two's day wednesday we haven't heard a peep everything's been great he's been doing his work all of a sudden here it is there's been it's like he's got some kind of a mental lapse like his Alzheimer's is kicking in again okay maybe it's hanging around with vermin and McQueen too much or something over there but there's some that child's got some kind of a problem well i'm afraid to go over there because i don't want to see blood shed in the building today especially yours here's a cheap mobile phone hello well that's what rages said rages said you got a cheap mobile phone it sounds like hell maybe it's the carry or clean charge yeah i get a video of three four four mm-hmm just got back in my truck they try to call you if they're gonna get through i don't know everybody talked about how it's done and how great he is i mean he's really nothing i mean don't i am is make how it's done look like he's not to play with that although uh how it beats and what i agree that i must just go yeah but the show is more creative they've uh i'm as the show is really funny yeah i agree with him as a matter of fact i'm sorry that you can't do the same type of show uh that he's uh why's that why he he gets a little more ruined you than you do well yeah but this is my amy and i think it's very perokial backwater bushly when i do a back town what i said is i'm sorry you can't do it i'm the thing you won't do it but i mean i was really sure that i really cracked up he was really funny and the bit that he has on his show is really good yeah hey right and it's a shame that you couldn't well the same but we don't want to we're doing uh whatever i mean there's some other stuff that we used to play that would be fun to play once in a while but it's not a big deal i mean we're kicking ass being a lot of air people and that's all i can't you know i understand it's too bad we're here well i agree with that too if we could take the weather and i'll go to New York then we'll be great i'll get the metal land right 20 after 10 and wio d we have an opening in pombe it six five five wio d so anyway Gary Reedus is on third base in the bottom of the tent thinning with one out the score a scoreless ballgame there's no way that the cubs aren't going to lose right and don's Zimmer intentionally walks two men in a row RJ Reynolds and Barry bonds to fill the bases and here's Jose Lee that Maddox goes three and one on Jose Lee one more wide one forces in the winning run the losing run for the cubs now it's three and two and here's a ground ball to third and vans lost steps on the bag for the force to end the in a distant incredible i can't get over it and someone we know is turned his mic in the opposite direction which is fine with me it's a 21 past ten and wio d we do have it opening in date if he moved real quickly let's get the cup later on it's will make him feel better hello all i know is that the studs that it keep win because the metal right all those mats are doing it man what a get three hits yesterday that's yeah it's all right we get the hits that count the hits that count got it better keep how it Johnson healthy i'll tell you that isn't isn't he the guy they wanted to trade all during the preseason they were desperate to get rid of him that's right you're right they know their players man but that one Sam well he's gonna have at least two or three hits for them this year you want that was a worst trade of a terrible trade man dikes is a good ball player great well good luck to you guys you two guys okay you don't hate the cubs he's all right he was a decent guy right just getting like nicknally puts inflammatory comments on the calls just to you know stood up a little bit kind of a Steve Cain syndrome by the way Steve today thank god has open phones he originally was gonna do baby selling part two believe it or not which had many of the people in the building and peeling themselves on any sharp object they could find and you know the spindles that you put your messages on you know those with that stick straight up what do they call those spindles Mike spindle and there were people grabbing those all over the building and trying to impail themselves when they saw the schedule here but the good news is you don't have to you can wait till another day no baby selling part two on a cane show today we have open phones today and there are a lot of people who are going to church praying right now thanking the lord 23 past 10 at wio d will be right back can twenty seven at wio d one open line if you want to get in on this so you're going to be quite a shelter day have the feeling already I just the ambiance of the building is starting to create a feeling in my bones five two four wio d we have an alis fiery port of the pombie tline hello hello guys how you doing great well yesterday at two o'clock you know what I found out what Steve show is going to be which Steve Steve Steve would open phones just great I grew yeah yeah you were guest get those guest dogs get rid of them Steve you're great but the guest sock he was hooked up on those topics you know like this baby selling or whatever the horses just out of bed but it all kind of ties in together he's in his baby thing you know yeah well you know so anyway I'm punching around a little bit and all of a sudden I punch up out and which you know I guess I'm one of the few people but so anyway alis is talking about the two knee handrails that are laughing and making fun everybody on the other station really and then he takes a little cheap shot about the adult cinema really he says yeah probably hanging around the adult cinema you know what I'm saying like that yeah so you know I mean during our spare time we all go over we drive down the Hollywood and we hang out just outside don't go in anymore and I have no dangerists well you know I can go out in the parking lot just check out who might be going in you know I gotta say one thing I've been to a lot of the movie you know are you two he's three and you know what so is Alice I'm sure he has and you know I can't if Alice doesn't cool we're gonna start telling you which kind but well I don't know but could happen to know do you what the deal is but they're quite an imagination to wrap up I think it got me was you know last week I punched him up one time and he's foaming at the mouth over Lynn Russell how gorgeous she isn't everything yeah yeah you really does it for him yeah yeah why I got a thing Lynn Russell I think she's hot looking too you know but you know that's but I just he's a little anorexic looking because I used to work with Lynn at the cat but she's an attractive lady and then Debbie comes on it says well I'm jealous of you and you know the string oh great yeah they're trying to ride the crank of the straight in it and it was good for a two eight in this trend man Steve at a four six Alice had a two eight I mean you know no wonder he wants to talk about anything but the number is because he doesn't have any right one more little shot I got to take care of it's not the only thing he doesn't have but that's another story what was the WI and C 25 to 54 numbers on after you drive oh and after you won one yeah wow yeah when Stan was there they did five you know I'd try to control yourself I know you're emotionally charged now but try to you know but the the excuse was they couldn't sell the show well they can't sell any show over there I know the excuses they can't sell it because they don't have any numbers so they've always got some extra well you know what comes around goes around yeah and you may be part of it is much of our sales department came from over there so that should give you a real good insight well tell you you guys got your work cut out for it yeah well let me just make sure let me verify what I just said because I don't want to give any bogus numbers now let's see W snooze had a one five and the afternoon 25 of that's Alice and I know I take it back I and C went from a one eight to a one two so I cheated him out of a tenth of a point what are really doing it huh they're doing it okay have a great day bye bye thanks a lot so Alice is really getting pretty raw gee huh I heard that what preceded him yesterday was about his raw gee as you can get but of course Alice doesn't make too much out of it try to like skip on by you know I got at its old Henry Burrow in there standing up a stooping over in the control room yeah I guess you must have left us some of his stash behind there came back in to get it 10 30 a W I O D we do have it opening in Palm Beach which is pretty damn depressing 65 5 W I O D those two what was the word Neanderthal on that other station who's been there time ripping everybody gee with I still mean he fell mean you know I mean to me my amy hello yeah and good old meanie rhymes with what's the steet right we okay this is not I was thinking Queeny but that's okay same difference I guess I'm a mette fan from my amy alright Steve I want to congratulate you on your coves I did a great job yesterday thank you there it is it's the 22nd of June and we're still in first play I'll still be very interesting if you guys were in there September you know because I hate gonna be 14's all the way down to the wire all the 14's that are up there right now believe me look got for Montreal oh boy they're tough yeah the best team went to I'll be kind of neat though I'm yeah I don't want to tell you the truth of the coves wouldn't it wouldn't be too upsetting because Harry's a pretty good guy and he needs to get a world surging for he leaves us exactly which could be soon away these games are going to come tell you but uh one nothing to say you know what I do is I watched seeing and sport headline news cut you know catch the scores and when if I get to herald and they don't have the scores and um one nothing and 11 innings not too bad yeah Glenn did you play baseball when you were younger? Please be alone no seriously did you play baseball when you were younger? I mean because I in my opinion is that people didn't play baseball when they were younger don't like baseball games no I did play baseball there's a big difference in my brain of playing and watching oh you good because I'm wondering maybe it's like you were just going like that I don't know where it's going he asked you were you good I was nothing to do with any what is it a non-reasonable it not he was pretty bad sir well probably he was bad okay I couldn't just want to play baseball you played tennis lot when you were young Glenn yeah some so we could have I don't know now this caller is because you know something I never I played baseball but I never played tennis I never played tennis either see there you go all I could be honest with you I love hockey and I never played hockey so I guess it doesn't work I got this is so you're nuts man oh I thought I know but that's the size of voice I think you hit a wrong nerve here so yeah he's getting upset I look when I apologize I look when I mean I don't meet up set you but like when Neil does go on vacation I think the rating is through drop a lot and you know well I tell you what when you get your show you know and you go on vacation I won't listen to your feeling well I don't want to be a radio DJ that well I thought you were an expert on analyzing the ratings no I'm not gonna do it you all about the ratings I don't think they do drop first you know well they ever tested or anything like that well they take ratings all year and I don't think they do take a lapse so it doesn't it's true that there's an increase in the cards that are played when you play you can't come from Dennis Collins over W. Snooze is very upset about our revealing their terrible numbers and he had a comment for it yeah by the way that that cart you're dying over here that's my brother-in-law is it yeah supposedly I wasn't listening to it he's a doctor no he's uh what does he do he's an advertising he's an advertising yeah figures but he's like he's bringing to me that he's playing and playing it I mean doesn't impress me but I've to decide to the point no I don't think it's him anyway okay well he's a guy with your doctor and Glenn you know hanging there Glenn and hopefully by the you know when the penalty came up on that guy will you get ready to him 1034 at Wild we have an open line in date 7519463 the days are getting longer not to mention okay it's 1050 at Wild the not much of a show today but don't blame us it's the calls okay nothing I can do about kidding let's go to coconut Grove hello hi Daniel great um can you still have you there I have all the numbers anything you want I brought him in just so we could be ponderous today and repeat him over and over again okay if your Alice's number is one more time okay could give me some of the numbers for WDR WDR well let's see let me just um really didn't get in the idea no okay many team plus WDR is on the well it's not on the second page it's um not on the third page it's on the fourth page you went from a two five to a one five wow that's unusual that's a lowest number they've had in a long time um persons 12 plus Monday through Sunday 6am to midnight this is the most meaningful one I guess uh see they're not on the second page they're not on the third boy this is incredible they went from a two two to a one five I guess uh how one of five must take a lot of their audience away I think so yeah because they're like in the desperate old rooms what about those 25 to 54 numbers 25 to 54 as well let's take a look okay I don't think you'll like it but um because it doesn't sound like they're sent in the world one fire 25 to 54 here's the weekend you don't care about that well let's see how about in this day part midday they're not on the second page they're not on the third page they went from a two one to a one three in midday after you drive they're not on the second page they're not on the third page they're not on the fourth page oh no I must have missed a wave man that's got to be a mistake okay just a second midday or this is afternoon drive three to seven they're not on the uh they'll here they are from a three one to a two two now they dropped about a point all across they had a death-nell trend really flat yeah flat no not flat kind of like go off the edge yeah I think you have a pretty good show um but I think as long as it comes in your eyes are in the race blend you can expect a lot of baseball talks right we have a good way to exciting exactly it's exciting like Steve Stone always says it's going to be exciting the chat bird okay thanks a lot pal 1052 a WIDI I guess he told you we have an open line in date 7519463 and in a week I'll be going on vacation and you won't hear anymore about baseball you won't hear anything except what he wants to talk about and that'll be great that'll be terrific and there'll be a lot of feedback hate shows we have an opening in Broward 524 WIDJ on level probably beyond is that her name level uh huh I'll love it and maybe Sally Fizzle come over and bring some refer up here for an alia let's go to Hollywood hello yeah I just want to find you what what is your problem with me I what did I do what did I say to you what did I do do you I never walked around who is this off friend of mr. baseball oh then all this in a front of mr. baseball this is the big guy who stands here for four hours and the leans over the table and keeps repeating the same things and brings that goony guy over and like nobody else was doing it what I mean I know nobody I know don't you want to you don't be like a child okay nobody else was doing that's not the queen you're on the back where the back mr. rest is that's your buddy I never said anything about you about you first of all I'm not the one that's got the big problem with your Steve is the one that's got the big problem the I have a problem with mr. rest in the guy with a dog okay but you threw me and I mean like that I threw you in because Steve doesn't want you there okay and since we all have to be there together and then I've got my couple of people I don't want there and he's certainly entitled to eliminate anybody who gets on his nerves okay you doesn't like you that bone headed mutant that called in yesterday and said mr. s mr. s mr. baseball is going to come and make trouble with full of a net that's not true well first of all see how childish this is like a couple little kids in a sandbox like you're being his spokesman or something okay just his presence just his being there creates trouble as far as I'm concerned because the guy's a moron okay and if he's your friend it probably says something well he's a moron he doesn't have anything he doesn't have anything in first of all hands around the whole time he looks like somebody poured about four he had five hundred pounds a lot into a into a tube and he just stands there and prespires and runs around yelling and catches clear and well that's his opinion he's entitled to but I don't think most of us care okay in fact that catches on Larry King did I let him call in that show tonight okay I want to mention one other thing okay I like I said I admit I stood around I mean don't you have something else you can do on a Saturday absolutely I mean on a beautiful set I go out to the track I go out to do something okay on a Saturday besides going out to see us I've already seen us 400 times okay okay for cars I mean they are given your food out of no you're not looking for cars don't give me that you're not looking for one of my friends wait it's not like I was the only one I mean you have Lloyd but you've been there 400 times I never saw Lloyd before okay don't you can't you take no for an answer sir can't you just give it a rest this time I'm gonna be by the table what do you're not gonna be by the table we don't want you there period don't you understand we don't want you there I'll you just to make make these who what do you mean who are we if there are people who come by and annoy the hell out of us we're it's our it's our deal okay no you're not coming peaceful you're not coming at all and if you show off the security guard will escort you out and why do you fall me in the same boat and me don't you understand we don't want to there we hate you like plays and sir we hate you like plays and you make us not just we can't stand you this is a day actually he's gonna be there whether we want him or not okay here's one of those people you cannot insult wow this yeah unbelievable who are we to decide we're the ones who are putting the thing on okay and if there's anybody we don't want there you don't have some constitutional right to come to our remote okay you've heard that before yeah it's like the people who say they got a constitution right to call it top show well that's already been discarded very rapidly okay go do something useful like burn a flag or something okay that's protected now you got a right to do that 1056 a WIOD and we have an open line in Broward 5249463 524WID lunch isn't here yet Jared it's getting real nervous okay he's getting just antsy is out about 1130 okay 1130 but we do have some jello here someone cake it's jello it's moldy

trip he's great and they we're gonna put him in a cage everybody come out and see him and film peanuts give them those flaming bananas did you ever hear anything like that we don't want the guy there and he insists he's gonna come out he's been at every stinkin remote that I've done probably everyone that Steve has done and we just say hey stay away at least one time and give us a rest and he won't do it I couldn't believe it has no life at all none you couldn't zero yeah well we're just no sense there's no feeling okay alright take a day this is the ant friend Tony yeah Tony yeah the ant friend that he never heard of oh no get a little chronically Tony well you know I just got a chronicle heard this new whole phone and I just want to let you know don't remember I'm fine I'm here I

don't bring that buzzer see you Tony take it easy yeah that can get over this hour yeah I'll just spin well see what I said this is cool time back I said this a couple of times back when we do these remotes wherever it is the object is to get a good crowd sell cars sell boats whatever it is you know that we happen to be doing and it always it's always the case okay but the bottom line is I said it before and I'll say it again it's not that I don't appreciate people who like the show but I am not particularly fond of obsessive groupies okay so if you've come out there 8000 times before you can only get so many autographs before your collection starts falling out of the shelf okay I mean enough is enough let's get some different people to come by okay some new and different people to eat the free food and get the pictures and the bumper stickers and do whatever you know let's get a whole flock of new folks and let's some of the chronics who've been by 8 million times snoring already stay home for once okay wouldn't that be a good idea wouldn't that be nice be a nice novelty okay the Elbreida standing by with 11 o'clock Wiod News welcome back with what hopefully it will be a much

okay I give you call some kids forget to gain the mob enjoy it I will my 11 18 at WI Odea let's go to Margie hello well this is the latest by report yes ma I was driving the work last night and Chris why not a run on my can you yeah Chris I'm not in the work last night and data played written on the subway wall wow yeah my favorite station yep I heard it last night are you cereal I sure was there was a cheat it was no it was data because my husband said he had it on data when I left for work on 94.9 right my favorite station Zeta 4 uh huh okay thanks a lot thank you bye now is that incredible now does that she is playing it Zeta's playing it who does that can spicuously leave out as I point my finger to the wall to my left that spike wise hmm maybe if you put a little time in the building and spend some time on at music instead of goofing off playing golf all the time maybe they'd play some music okay that really frost my ass a little bit okay isn't that great go to their turning the corner over there can't even get you to say anything good about them well I don't think it's gonna make any difference okay because they're riding the crest of that up skier gimmick over there and that's what they've been doing so Alice is riding the crest of the straight gimmick now is that it with his two eight all the way to the bottom one thing I like about him is his intellectual honesty okay I must say that don't you 20 minutes past eleven a w i d we have an open line in palm beach 65 5 9463 655 W i o d north my whoops rong one north Miami hey how you doing top fan in the bud man here try to control yourselves yeah yeah yeah you hear the ladies remember what's in oh I hear the Yankees after watching Maddox when what didn't any last night I was looking to trade for them so they can do it with the d h yeah probably couldn't hurt yeah the way you're sitting there's a lot of he's sitting three oh one by the way yeah which is about eighty points more than Sean Dunston yeah you better can't play short time you're probably good is there a better athlete than Sean Dunston what is the ambient we're gonna be there this we're hoping we're bambi is gonna pull out all the stops or something all the well well we might stay home in that case glad not got a question for you big guy when the I need your communication next week I figured you might want to bring me and so I can handle all the sports calls for you yeah you know and I listen to that not bad now he's bringing in Joe's a Gaki who wants a little excitement on a show oh yeah yeah okay okay see okay how do you want to be able to cover the sports but at the same time have a level of excitement and enthusiasm seldom seen in the history of runfacing so he's bringing in Joe who's doing sports so far anyway sunny in Joe sunny and sure and the guy log is today Joe is not uptight or upset about anything that I say he's uptight with Steve because he hates Steve with a passion but then the whole sports department does so that's nothing now it's just something they got going long before we came here by the way so don't blame that one on us yeah and what did Hank say about Valley parking I didn't hear that about how he has no problem and he never pays for it figures you know those sports people the worst three loaders snores in the history mankind never would be able to know how you like the barstein root beer by the way that great having his 8th can right now is a matter fact it is excellent now by the way the regular which I bought by mistake the other days and so hot it's not really good I couldn't believe it I thought what the hell is this and I look at the label and I bought two bottles of regular with sugar in it which may be why I sound a little bit hyper this morning anyway I haven't been rigging I've been drinking my mountain valley waters and okay so I have permission to do that Toyota of Hollywood is the place this Saturday it's day after tomorrow noon tilts so good luck to you okay not does how like this kind of me however that guy he was talking about might have been responsible in part for this see we got a little extra effect on that because you know who is responsible for it I'm like Anthony yeah it was rejected they never two weeks it was on here and they said get serious when I get rid of it I like that kind of timber to it don't you well you know it's not a wacker twist but it did fit in on the Bill McQueen show though that's true 1127 I WID we apologize for a real crappy show today but I can make head to the like I just want to make head to the only highlight of the show is when that guy called in I was arguing with him that was fun that was it that was it that was a good thing maybe he'll call back I have to take two calls a day but in his case I'll make an exception please Andy because otherwise it's just going to we're going to throw it out and I apologize by the way for what I said there because Laura was the troublemaker who gave us that story that you want to punch her in a mouth one time okay screen her out you wouldn't I'll get somebody else to punch her in a mouth how's that okay it's 28 now Scott would get upset because Scott's I'm thin ice she and Ross are getting pretty tight these days Miami hello hey Neil how are you doing great hey bird how are you oh just wonder they're certainly sir hostel who's your board up Neil our

morning's okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah all of the afternoon took a real big dump and that's what somebody here was real excited about well I don't know what he did what did they do on morning alright I'm looking I'm looking okay this is where's my morning stuff is all I'm in these are so out of order his weekends here's midday which I kind of like but it isn't midday huh I mean I like ours in midday we had a bit of a mistake that we did we kicked out it's but good well let's see six to ten a.m. I'm on it through Friday persons 12 plus gloves 94 in a morning went from they're not on the here they are from a three to a two seven just a minute yes it gets better it gets better it gets better where's all my morning stuff damn it 25 to 54 in a morning this six to ten a.m. loves 94 went from a four five to a three seven oh my the lowest number in the history of the modern history of the station mornings 18 to 34 this is another good one let's see here they went from a five five to a four four so they lost like for 20 percent of the audience yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you know they're in the tubes in the afternoon also I think I got a two eight well here afternoon 25 to 54 gloves 94 went from a four four to a three nine and in a wait a minute there's a better one just to record yourself in 18 to 30 40 after no I think they went from a five to a three seven wasn't that it's on my five three seven huge drop yeah five to a three seven well here today let me make sure here one last oh and look at his midday six two to a four seven 18 to 30 four right and here's the afternoon 18

out of a three seven and after 18 to 34 and they're like a drop in like a big boulder like dropping a dime off the Empire State building not I just what's her name Alice do not even not even worth mentioning a two eight Steve beat him come on sir let's ask a serious question great that's why Alice ever you'll never hear them discuss the numbers over there and Sandy went from a three five to a two eight oh Sandy and in 25 to 54 she had a one one we had an eight two she had a one one oh one oh I'm sorry one oh I love it and I'm reveling it oh man I can't I wish I could see Jim go we'll find

Uh, got a little question for you. Here you go, on a Chicago. Take a plane ticket, yes. No. Uh, I have one for sale. I'll leave him the 29th come back to six. I give you a good deal on it. Well, thanks, sir. I don't fly. I want. You walk? Yeah. Well, Dirt, I'd like to go to a club game, man. Yeah, I'm sure he'd be the first taker. I'm sure he'd be the first taker. I have to be price. Yeah, well, a lot of people have the problems and bears one of them. What? What's your problem? I don't understand. The whole of the show happens to be a great show. Today, every day, it's a great show. Neil talks a little baseball, everybody's happy. A little. Yep, you. Well, he just, you know, he just thinks we're here to talk about the things that he's interested in. And Phoebe's only got two of them, and you can only talk about him so long. Yeah, that's not true. He's only got two, and they're not that great anyway. Okay. Yeah, talk about it so much. No, I didn't think he's bad. Oh, I don't know. I mean, it's just unbelievable, isn't it? How long have I gone about it? Well, what would you like to talk about besides anything except the cubs? Well, so how about those red socks, huh? They got the bad thing. They got the Texas horse. Let me correct that. You know, wait, Boggs has got something to do. You know, there's a lot of things going on. Oh, look at this. Here's the thing is, say, she is not playing Dion. Well, how come we got the rumor that they were playing it? Boy, these rumors. Predator doubts about me. I have doubts about the Zader. They're not playing Dion. Well, what about Zader? They're playing it? Well, we certainly aren't going to get any calls over there. And I have a package up front. Well, Richard will go right up there and get it right now as we speak. So we can get it back. We got two minutes. Package plans. Okay. What were you saying, sir, about how the birds and idiot? Well, that's the size of point. The thing I want to know the thing, uh, love 94. Yeah. The show is good until they got rid of the, got rid agony. Like, do you guys, yeah. Now, does this guy, does this guy sort of stand out on the house? Yeah, he's got taste. Yeah. In crab. Let me tell you, sir. In my company, we're out from 430 to morning, all day long and that was our schedule. It was 94. 940. Don't you think we'll go right to the point, right to you guys. Now in the morning, we're kind of lost because Reneri really doesn't do it for us. Well, he's doing it for everybody else. He's got humongous numbers. So he must be doing something for somebody. But because he's getting the carry over. Carry over from what? From Larry King? No, everybody turned leaves at on. So, you know, right to you. Yeah, right from Bush. I think I'm in Tom Snyder and Larry King in the baseball game. Boy, you guys still on? Okay, nice tricer, but you're just, you're looking too hard. Oh. This is noodle. Minding you that it's always a good time for the great taste. Wasn't that a record? You're looking too hard by the scenes? Well, yeah. This is my favorite because I love the lyrics. Yeah. James addiction. Oh, I stepped on it too. I don't think I'm there. I didn't care of them. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, that's just about going to bring us to the end of the show. It's been a really bizarre show today to say the best. But lunch was excellent from our cellos and the jello mold that fabric is still got a little bit that's good. They'll come in good in the noon hour for dessert and James addiction, the album is selling very well according to Nick. But of course, we always know that he's reliable. And we're going to open his package at Riches brought in here during the break. So if we don't see again, I think the news is right. You'll know something special was in here. Who's got the news now? Is it April War, them's got the noon Wiod. Do you know is that you get some of you guys to stand up and salute the radio? And have we come back in 1205? Steve with open phones that's going to get the jirbel out. We have an open line in Palm Beach 655 Wiod. Kind of like using a code hanger, you know. Coral Springs, hello. Hey Neil. Yeah. How are you doing? Great. I have a little outer spider port before I get to. I want to do a little tinkle. I've called you many times and I listened to your show. I've been listening to you for a long time. I think your show is great. Yeah. And just don't go anywhere because if you do, it'll be the last thing that we have in this town. And the square port is a little bit of an hour's the other day. And he's talking to some old clutch in the ladies. He's about 175-180. You don't say? I don't say. And she's not like she choked on a phone and just died. Well, that's most of their audience over there. Well, that's true. And he says, well, I think her head in a bag just fell out. Yeah. And then after she hung up and it was gone, he says, He's called today. It comes from the needles of broadcast history. Oh, Alice. Alice. That is embarrassing. Well, you know, he still confused anyway. He doesn't know what he's saying. He's such a whip. I can't just keep it. Yeah. He's just like under, you know, that record by the stones under my thumb. Yeah. He's under Mike Thompson's thumb now. I don't know what his story is. He's slowly transforming into a little subservient right wing douchebag. And I guess, you know, he's writing the crest of that bizarre gimmick. I don't know what it is. I don't think he knows what it is. Well, it's good for about a two eight. I'll tell you that with the most ancient demographics in the history of the market. So good luck to them over there. They'll need it. Is that my slice? Oh, oh. Oh, oh. Now I just have no. It's not pizza. Jello. It's diet. And when's going to have a little. And then we were going to say one for Sharon, but if Tata Ross comes back, and they can have one. Well, I'm going to go eat my sandwich. Oh, okay. I'm glad we got your hungry. Sir, that's the idea. Can I call my brother Jay to a speck? No question about it. Thank you. You said it. Nine minutes past noon at WIO DB. Sure, come on to Toyota Saturday because we're going to have the guy with the eyes that Steve hates and Mr. Rasch and the guy with the dog. And I'm staying home, I saw. Hmm. But it is Jello. Excellent. You should go into business making Jello molds. Selling them on a street corner out of a subred hotdog cart. Wouldn't that be great about that? Yeah, an image. Don't be yellow. Eat riches, Jello. Oh, this is go, Wishers. It's kind of like triple becker. Raspberry, pineapple, and blueberry. I'll never forget the day it's either when he came in with that big wooden bowl and he gave us each a little tiny slice and then he ate the entire ring of Jello. This enormous ring, all by himself. Real quietly back there, just slurping it up. Boca. Hello? Yes? Oh, am I there? We catch you by surprise, sir. Yeah. It sure seems like it. Just keep talking to these people saying, get a life after waiting so long. You can see why they have one. That's the point. I keep hearing these references that the Kalamazoo on your station there. What station do you have from Kalamazoo? It used to be it was WTPS when I was there. Oh, and I'm in porc. Yeah. I grew up in Kalamazoo. You remember WTPS? Oh, yeah. I've been in the station on the corner of WTPS. Yeah, West did's road and portage Avenue. Yes. What was your name there? What was my name there? Yes. The same as it is here. Oh, isn't what you need a Rogers there? Okay. It's like nobody changes. Also you mentioned something about Gilmore Rod Casting, Swarne? Yeah, headquartered in Kalamazoo. That's correct. Is that Jim's? Yeah. You bet. Well, how about that? They don't love 94. Yes. Well, um, which took a big dump in the train, by the way. They didn't do so well. And you remember Larry Osterman used to be in Kalamazoo on WKZO? Yeah. Doing Tiger Baseball now on Pass Sports Network? Yes. Everybody's moved up. Yeah. I moved directly from Cleveland down here. I was going to keep referring to a consultant from a L area. Consulting from a L area. Radio consultant from a L area. How? We do. We do. I never heard of L area. Well, I mean, I heard the name. I never remember here. I must have been mistaken. Yeah. No, that's probably Greg B. Dill. Okay. Wait, how? I just wanted to give you a buzz. Good. You don't hear too many people from Kalamazoo down. That's for damages. It's a great town, by the way. It is. I thought it was great. I lived there in most of my life. I was going to be a little bit more of a big town. I close to the water. Yeah. Okay. See you. You bet. So 11. Afternoon at WID. We had the Rochester call. We had a Kalamazoo call. We'll begin a Lakeland call before too long. You marked my words down. That'll last a really long time. We have an open line in Boca and Del Rey and it's flashing even as I speak. How do you like that? So we may be picking things up a little in the big noon to two hours. Because it seems like only 10-12 hours ago we sat down here this morning. Okay. And just start having a great time. I'm ready for a nap now. Anyway, the word is there won't be any more food tomorrow or the next week on this show. Okay, for lunch, but we appreciate Marcellus was tremendous today. It was excellent. But we got to really get on a straight narrow path. Every time he say that, and the hell is it would say if you don't want to say the news from every time he say that. What? Well, we've heard that before. Well, we'll show them a thing for two. Okay. Okay. Okay. We're like Dennis James. How about it's past no? Let's talk about the sound of a cross-16 and W. Somebody's very upset because we did have a few cub calls. Some of you in New York's called, so he wants me to take one of these idiotic CDs and kind of go up and down to cuts like we used to and kill some time. As opposed to talking to our wonderful friends in Lusting audience, what do you think about that in Palm Beach? I think that's pretty ponder. Yeah. I just want much to know. I just went to Wings Plus. Oh man, those Wings are great. Are they the deduptment of blue cheese? Yeah, I did. I did my thing in the cheese. Oh. It was just, as you say, excellent. Yeah. In fact, when you dip your thing into the blue cheese, you never want to take it out again. Well, some of us down. Yeah. I'm getting pretty chronic. I called it three times and three days and I'll see you at Toyota Hollywood. Okay. We'll be looking for you. Good. I'm glad. Yeah. See you later. Bye. You want to talk to chronic, sir. Get all these honey pinheads out there. If we have all these ladies bringing their old soil under wear, well, we'll probably have about 40,000 guys lined up. I can understand why they're desperate in this town or everybody's desperate. Hold town is like, just dried up, man. You go out there and today is really desperate. Isn't it pretty quiet? Dark, bleep. Oh, yeah. Thrill braining. Beautiful. See, it's never supposed to be like this because it's bad enough where the weather is good. It's almost tolerable. Not quite, but almost. But when I weather is bad, you think, what am I doing? I could be an eerie Pennsylvania. So, what you think? And putting up with crap, I can be in James Town, New York. Yeah, I love it. Do you? Yeah. That's not laundry. Oh, well, I'll show you what you enjoy this. Rose bulger. Did he? Yeah. I don't think. What does that tell you? Thank you. But that's making down. It can make the world want to head to the ground. We all know how much expertise he's got. Those are the blues, McGoo's. And it's about the ratings over there. It's double the blues. We ain't got nothing yet. It's about the ratings on a morning show on Zeta. We ain't got nothing yet. But we're working on it. We're turning the corner. Oh, I like it. Yeah. I'll let's find out from the dark way, be if she likes it. Hi, Neil. Yes, they do like that song because they listen to KPX all the time and they play it. KPX plays it. Yes. Piper radio. I'm not sure what that was for being a bunch of arrogant little snott nose doos bag. I don't like their details, but I do like them. You know, I'm not happy attitude over there. Well, I shouldn't say that because they probably got a bunch of new kids over there. So yeah, they're all seniors and graduated. Hold on one second, okay. Okay. What does what does this mean? Please answer the phone. Hello, Neil. Yeah. Yeah. I just had a question for you. No sports questions. But I'm waiting for an hour and a half to go to work. I'm going to be driving past the radio station. I was just wondering if you guys had a drive through window for all the left over from the food you guys are doing. Have a nice day, sir. Okay. Well, you can you believe I have a lucky alone for 20 second for that. That's pretty or wrong. You waited for an hour and a half to ask us that little, like you question. Is that that's? Sir, listen, put the bandage around your wrist for them up a little bit. And have a nice day work. Anyways, I wanted to ask you, because of that thing that don't be a dickhead thing. My aunt is always asking me to do this. How can he get away with that? With one. That's on stations all over the country. That's not our thing. That's on stations all over the country. And it's a friend's been using that word on New York years. Years and years. That's a big deal. A colloquial expression. That means jerk. It's a liner on pirate radio. Yeah. It's nothing wrong with that. This is 1989 already. For a minute, about time people in this country start growing up just a little bit. I just don't know. I just don't know. It's a bottom. It doesn't offend me or anything. But she's always asking me, how can you get away with that? And I like I have no idea. Yeah. Well, that's because nobody's here all the time. Management is always the way. I told you. I told you. It's absolutely management. But they were irresponsible. I don't know. I don't know. Yeah. Well, anyway. Better govern yourself accordingly, Dorque Lady. I'm trying to. I'll see you guys on Saturday. Great. I'll bring some panties now. I'm not bringing. I just don't. The line though. You wouldn't do that. You're a little too class. You do that. But what's your name? I'm not. That was my uncle dishonor. What did he say? He said you're a Dorque. Oh, I said he said to bring theundies. No. He's finished with him. No, I want to tell him he's a Dorque also. Tell all my uncles that they're all Dorque. Well, there's going to be quite a crowd to see. Is it all let us down now? I know. Don't know. You're going to be you and Johnny Darker. Going to be the head of the day. Oh, please. Johnny Darker. I'd say Jo and Jo will be big hits. But there'll be two busy protecting their vehicles. Okay. Have a great day. Yeah. Five. Oh, boy. We got a sense of sensational stuff coming up on Saturday boy. I toyota of Hollywood. Right now it's time to tell you how look at what a segue. I look at the log in there. It is staring me in the face. Toyota of Hollywood. We're Steve and the bird and fat rich and Joe and Joey and Johnny Dark and Sharon and the Dorque lady I said and maybe Bambi and God knows who's that. What's his name? Paul Harvey Jr. Oh, man. We got this is this isn't just your idea. You know, this is a happening. Okay. No question. It's become. One. Wait a minute. This is just a biote. The future of talk radio is here today. It's it's it's only a radio show. So I'm shocking. Shotting. Shotting. You are a douche bear. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Hey, hey, hey. Yeah. It's real, it's real. It's, it's only a little bit. It's only a radio show, but it's the best of Neil Rogers Saturday mornings at Tanna, Newstalk Radio 6th and W-I-O-D. In fact, it's the moldy oldie hour with Bob Mould. What a thing. Look like a district. He does Bob Mould on the way old gold with Bob Mould. Like an oldie show. Yeah, black thing. Yeah, people just like to say, black CFM. He'd get on there on Sunday night. I like this. Yeah, actually. The rate, record. See how come it is that we used to here and just put it on and listen to it and know it's good. We didn't have any focus groups. Call it consultant. Oh, I don't like this business. I really don't care what Renery says. And I hope he has a great time on his vacation, by the way. But he's wrong. This is not a good business. It's a terrible business. Because nobody, almost nobody knows what they're doing. Anyways, called seal little light, produced written and sung by Bob M-O-U-L-D mold. Is that a hit? It's on virgin records, by the way. So how bad can it be? I don't know. That means we can play it in Miami. It's on virgin records. Untouched by human parks. Anyway, we'll find out from some of our music intensive pinheads if that's a big hit. By the way, down the best in Neil Saturday, while we're out of Toyota, they can be listening the entire bird's birthday show. It's a good show. When we had a whole cast of thousands in here, we had Johnny Dark, and we had just tons of food and Hank Goldberg. And that rich fat rich of course. It was without saying the middle. Thursday. Yeah. Pompano, hello. Well, yes, sir. Hi. This is T.C.A.S. This week. And we are at the top 40. My friend, Gladio, was afraid his butt he'd go wide. Okay, I love him 55. It was nice. It was when we were not taking calls for all that time. Didn't you enjoy that period of time? I let it really good time. And there was no hospital idiots. That was kind of funny though. I thought we just kind of cute, you know. It had his moments. In fact, we got a special dedication for that last call, which I think will be very appropriate and kind of sit right in. We're not going to be a bigger rid of these speaking of course. Okay, 1256 at I didn't want to play that last liner because we have to go for ourselves accordingly. Miami. Hello. I'm doing it. Okay. I'm pretty good. I didn't ask how you're doing, but I'm glad you're doing pretty good. It was an interesting response. It was kind of like an automatic reflex. About an hour. I've been all about that. You thought I would say how you're doing. Let me ask you a question. Yeah, go ahead. How are you doing? Uh, okay. I'm just sleeping right now. The way I said about 10 minutes before, I happened to get into car, third hour and a half. I was talking about your hours. All is. I'm not talking about you as opposed to you. You figured out sooner or later. You were talking about the self-centered self-serving person that always reads the trends on the radio. And if it wasn't for your trends, you'd be on the street. What the hell does that mean? That's why saying that Howard Stern would not be on a street if he didn't have big numbers. What does that mean? I just caught the last. Don't, now let me ask you a question. Don't we read everybody's numbers? We don't just read our numbers. We, in all in fact, proud of the numbers. I'm happy we do well. But we read everybody's numbers, including Alice's. That's what he's upset about. How did he give, did he give his numbers? No, no, no, I just said last six seconds. Oh, right. We'll see that wouldn't be self-serving because his numbers suck so bad that there would be embarrassing, humiliating, and degrading. We, I've been doing this on the years since way back when I was on that station. And you know something? We were working together on that station. He was always delighted. I gave the numbers up because he had big numbers then. So he was tickled to death because I gave his numbers, too. Wasn't self-serving. Fascinating. In fact, not only is it not self-serving. It's a pubic service we do for the whole business because we let everybody know how they're doing. I am one of your Cuban-Cosso listeners. Great. I do listen to your show completely through Monday through Friday every second of it. Excellent. We don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't out because that's a self-serving thing to do, sir. He's probably enjoying. But let me ask questions to Bert. Oh, God, you were doing so well. I don't need to fancy it. It's a good guy. This is a, you know, pretty guy here. I like this. I like to tell you something. I'm about that trade about yesterday, uh, Anderson and Polonia. So, right? Well, that's why, to be honest with you, sir, he's pretty upset. He liked Ricky Henderson. He thought he was a hell of a ball player. And he is so sick to with stomach that these New York teams are making all these bad trades. That's why he's upset. Yeah, I just don't know what he's going to do. He didn't want to admit it, but he can't, you know, Dijkstra and McDonald, I was bad enough. But now Ricky Henderson, he's, he's at it. Yeah, I can't sleep at night. He's never going to New York again, sir. I can't sleep at night. My parents are just going down to drain all time. Your pirates, huh? Yeah, I'm fine. By the way, thanks a lot. I mean, I've been since, like, in the, out 60s. And, you know, my, it was Roberto Crometti. He was the best man. He was the right one. I mean, they, he, he took it. I just cried my ass. Yeah, that was terrible. I was on here in Sarasota when that happens. That's just, uh, just cry. Just cry. I guess that's one of the instances you always remember where you were and what you were doing. Yeah, if you were a pirate's fan. Oh, I don't think they're, well, they're, you know, Roberto Crometti was okay. No, I did. Or Bill Verdon or Bob Skinner, like Dijkstra or Don Hoker, Dick wrote or Bill. Oh, he, he wrote, he, Berges or Housebury, they're Bob Friend or Vernon Law functioning in society. Right. I understand it. I don't know. I think they could have a good old man. I don't know that they tried. I don't know. I don't know. Well, listen, I hope you guys have a grand month after tonight, okay? All righty, good luck. Okay. He was a good caller in Split of the fan. Poor Alice. It's the son. It's that self-serving. They give a thing. They're doing it to be interpeeting the crap out of me and Sandy. We can't take it. Okay, we got to April with him with the one-to-clock news and the big one-to-our Steve with open phones. We're all going to try to put you up just a little bit. Now, here's Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD. It's the one to two-hours. All the obscure beastboys cut while the time is new from us. On WIOI and New. Even after the hum, kicking at it too. Happy birthday, Brian. If you ever get out of bed again, we might get him on the show. Here's a fact. Glenn, how come nobody plays Billy Stewart. I do love you. Was it giant hit and floor? I remember that. My favorite. Also, it was great hearing the night crawlers. Do you remember the birdwatchers? This is Steve from oral springs. Well, thanks a lot, Steve, for the nice facts. Here's an idiotic fact with one of those. Look at this. You'll fall so stand up, right? Some people. Somebody has written, turning the corner and Tim Williams sucks on the ball. That's getting pretty heavy duty. It is true, but that's nasty. Then you'll love this. Here's some stats for Rick Suckliff and Kramer, who's pitching for the Pirates tonight. Lifetime against the cubs. How many times are you going to read this? Me dozen times. I know Kramer. One in one. Kramer has a crazy Kramer. He's pitching tonight. And I wonder who's catching. He's catching. I like that. Yeah, well knowing the principles involved. What are the six UWI-D? We have an open line and a groward 5249463. I guess 10 would know the answer. We have an open line and Palm Beach, 655. WIOD. And we're going to go back to these phones because this is, of course, is the meat and potatoes of talk shows in this market. Hello, man. Yes, Alex. What I think. What you said is terrible. They're always making fun of everybody. Where's my we team? Yeah, he's getting frustrated. I guess being a babysitter to 100 year old plus old douchebag far, that's their whole audience. You know, he just can't relate to it. That and Harvey from Kendall. I will confess that I punched because I was not in the Steve's topic. It all yesterday. And I punched over to Alex, which I've done maybe four or five times in the last six months. And I was on there for like one minute, you know who the caller was? No, this is about 20 after two. It was Harvey. Oh, I can't. On and on, I just, I just failed on. Who even mentioned my name by the way? What did he say about that? That what a travesty it was having Mike Thompson on opposite Neil and how Mike Tom. And you know, see, the thing with Harvey from Kendall, what he says always makes a lot of sense, but he's just so chronic that it doesn't make it. He didn't hear Alex's response. That's what he said. Now he was whining. Why are you picking on Michael? Oh, my. Poor waterdale. Hello. Yeah, how you doing? Great. Hey, the reason why I'm calling number one, are you? What just happened? Somebody pick up your phone there. What somebody's messing with the damn phone? Tom, you get off the damn phone now. Exactly. Anyway, I want to thank my boss for letting me wait all this time, but a couple of things. Magic. Why don't you call it tragic one or two? I've been doing that for three years. Okay. Well, that's okay. It's probably where you heard it. Probably. I had your guy next door Steve. I know he used to be a DJ over there. Who? Steve? Yeah. Oh, Steve stands for. He's a big move over there. That's when everyone started calling a tragic. You know, he was a manager. I don't remember that. I don't remember that. He was with K102. Oh. Yeah. And, um, well, he was just getting pretty heavy duty. He was a KGR. Thanks. Um, no. He was a KY2. Oh, okay. Anyway, number two, you've read the rules. You want Stone magazine with your Frankie's uh, uh, uh, Yeah, we had it the other day. They had a great review on it. Yeah. Well, it was in great. It had three stars. But then again, everything in that. Hey, listen for them to give D on three stars. I mean, you know, it was fantastic. Because it's Harrison Donda was waist yet. Right. Yeah. I agree. I agree. I take them with the grain of salt anyway. Yeah. But why get mine? I subscribe to it. So I want to get it in the mail. I always put a little salt on it before I open it up. I get it also. But I'm thinking about it. And then the dogs, then the dogs attack it and they rip it up because they like the salt on there and it gets ripped as shreds. So it's a good excuse for why never read it. I don't know if you have a bird. Yeah. I do have a bird. Oh, yeah. We bird can use it. Uh-huh. Yeah. Anyway, I just wanted to call and see having a great show. We sure are. And, uh, birds, you know, you don't have to be in the sports, but, uh, you know, I kick back and listen. Don't take it so personal. Exactly. Well, I do listen and listen, but I can only listen for so many hours. By the way, we gave up. We're on hiatus on call. People are listening for our picks. We're taking a little time off on that because I've been in a bad slump. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I don't know if it's the parking going on, you know. Yeah. That's true. We ought to write off Kyoto, man. At one day. Uh, well, have they been getting a little better than anyone call you in a apologize, explain the situation? No, they said it was my fault. I shouldn't have left the money in there. Oh, geez. Yeah. That's what I said. Oh, geez. Okay. Well, uh, you bird that take it easy and have a great rest of the day. What's up for those? We're eating that rolling stumbard. Look out for those cups tonight, pal. Oh, yeah. Well, we'll see what happens. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. New Rogers. The rocket-rare animal. Well, I had a head called caught in bed. But I saw the trouble ever since I went to get home. Oh, yeah. And I thought I was going to get home. Oh, man. What are you? Oh, man. Oh, man. What does that look? I just said, heard that in a couple of decades. Elvis. I know. I just caught my ears. It's Elvis. Just caught my ear. That's the story. Again? Yeah. So it's either that he's alive or he's like all the rest of the motions. Where are you little star? Why are we going to take a lot of calls? Oh, you didn't say, I lied. I didn't say that. I got it. I lied. I said that. I don't know why. Let them just do. I never had any intention. But we have like some great cuts left under. 19. 18. We didn't get to play. I think there would be if we took a survey which we won't. But if we took a survey, there would be some people say that's the greatest record of all time. Really? I'm not saying I'm saying that. But there would be some like Todd thinks so. Next to at the hot by Danny and John. He never heard that record in the last hour. I heard this before having to. Oh, yeah. He's into these oldies. Don't say this to me. It's in to be into oldies. He's got his hair cut there and everything. He's all said to go. Okay. And I like that. Another one now. Everybody's big into this. This is a smash. Oh. Right up your alley. Yeah. I think some plant city. John leaves the joke. He's the bird. He's the bird. He's the bird. He's the bird. He's the joke. I bet you in the 50s in Plancity. The Everny brothers were gigantic. And Elvis was that could have been even bigger than in Vegas. Elvis in Plancity wouldn't you think? That's right up there alley over there. Everybody driving their pickup trucks with the Everny brothers. Blank. And they're like six shooter in the back. I would think that would be the way to do it. And this was a monster too. Oh, yeah. You know, question. You don't get no 50. Well, that was a kiss. Yeah, again. Why 50? You ain't gonna rock and roll no more. Don't go bad. And last but not least. And this is in a new movie. So, you know, when the movie like Stand by me, and all the songs come back a second time. The kids think that's like their music. Yeah. These little pinheads were busy pricking their pimples. Or pimpling. How does that go? This? You check my nerves and you run on the brakes. Right? These made a new recording of it. And they thought on the H1 since Seria, and they did it again. The first one. All right, I've got any. Any young girls wish me right now. I have a little suggestion. Don't marry juryly loose. I don't. And if you do marry them, don't take a bath. Okay? Because they go into bathtub. You never come out. And then like a whole succession of those. What's he married about? 20 young girls. I'll go to take a bath and they have a little problem in here. Okay, 29 after one at Wild. My amy. Hello. Yeah. No, it's not in jail. Oh, it's not. You're just stealing Joe's material. What the hell is that? Well, you know, it didn't sound like Joe, but I couldn't imagine anybody else saying that. This is David's six hands. Well, how you doing, Dave? Hey, it was creeping on hold during the news. I love kids to lay a bill about. Yeah. I love to have it build up during the news, huh? Oh, yeah. Well, when April does the news, a lot of guys feel that way. You bet. Listen, I'm looking forward to see it. Play the Hollywood Saturday. Great. And Glenn, especially you haven't met you before. I see you there at Neil. What's it twice before, but I'm going to meet you Glenn. But you've seen me, but you never met me. No, no, no, no. See me out there before. Well, that's good. Just leave me alone. I'll be sitting there just nine and a round business. And you can all talk to the bird. I'm going to be reading the box store from the game. Okay. If I'm going to see Glenn. I think that was a great story. Did you have a day to grumpy story? I did too. I don't know what Neil's problem was. That was hysteria. What was that out of? People. Okay. I'll check that out. Yeah. I've heard of a butt licker, sir, but are you a bird licker, is that it? No, not going to invent something new. Be serious. And I'd like to listen to it. Henry Barrow thinks, by the way, that bird licker is something you drink for breakfast. Just a little joke, pal. Okay. Listen to Neil. When you had tried a Hollywood, you know, you'd be good at delicious, and you'd be able to scream and move you a boy in his dog. Why is that? Well, you know what's got the dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's dog's Oh, they got with it. Now, the movie with a different dog, different guys. I believe okay. John Johnson would be very insulted. Yeah. It's a good movie, by the way. Yeah. That's not okay. James addiction. Yeah. James addiction. I don't like that. Don't play anymore. Okay. Now, what's the reason why I gave it to Nick? I gave him a CD. So Nick, one of them just to tell me. He's a Nick, yeah. Listen, I got a problem. And I know someone in your house can really listen. I know Brenda too. What are you going to have to win Bob Biel? It's just a whole house. It's funny. You might say, I was dealing around on the satellite the other day, and there it was. Yeah. Yeah. This whole house. It was an old one from last winter. Yeah. But there was old Bob Vila. I love the way he pronounces his name. Like kind of shot like a child. It's not going to be the same. You think you're in a master car? People hand on all room. No. Here's a note on the screen. Todd said he wants to hear James addiction. Well, Todd, I want to tell you. So, oh, you made that up, right, Nick? Because that was going to say I would do almost anything for Todd. And I do mean almost. But that's going a little too far. Nick, see Nick likes to lay this crap on everybody else because he has bad taste. He did this to share on the other day. And he said that she loved the album. And she came in putting her finger down or throw it and gagging and puking and then He's sucks. So, you're just like out there on a limb, Nick. Just like usual. Yeah. All right. You know, I want to be put on hold for the wedding round, but before I go, you know, Before he goes. You know, he goes. You know, he's got, you put the struggling lady. Was that tough and newer old? That was from yesterday. Really? Yeah. Well, we're going toisuíchle it here. Hold on. I was going to take that to college. You got to challenge that two friends on a phone,ента, now, man! Yeah! I will be making an album number one, honey! That's mywwww. Now, what do I like about her? She's consistency, then? Yeah, he too. just I'm ready to stick him up his ass and they'll always have them. Yeah, she's great. I love her. Okay, hold on, Phil. One. One thirty two. I wonder if that's Donna's mother. Do you think so? Never thought of that. Yeah, they're like, I don't know. There's pop now though. Yeah. Well, that child has just got a lot of problems. A biggest one being that he's a gutless wonder, but other than that, he's terrific. You know, I don't know. He also, you know, the thing he said about the trends, he doesn't like, I guess to remember back when he was on midday briefly. On the first one to midday is an INC and I had a nine chair and he had a two seven and he stuck his tail between his legs and went running off into afternoon drive and then Steve came over here and Steve regularly beats the crap out of him. In fact, when Steve and Stan were both on at the same time with Alice, Steve and Stan both beat the crap out of Alice who was a poor third virtually in every trend. There may have been one or two flukes, but basically that's it with those horrible demographics. So he can keep talking all those elderly, elderly, elderly, post senior post death senior citizens and the continued trying to fool us, but you know, he's just doing the same old tired crap that he's done a million times. It's pathetic. He thought I mean, if we didn't sit here and do anything but make gutterable sounds, it would be more entertaining and talking of those same old fetches and whining about Ali North and the same old tired crap. Give it a rest, Alice. Okay. Even bring the urin lady back was more entertaining than that. That show was a pister man. I'm star movement, get that idiot off the air. There you go. Well, have a great luck. Okay, I want to let you know. Sure, no problem. I don't think you guys want. Because I know we got a moron on five. It says hello. What is Nick Dickie? Excellent. Come on.
