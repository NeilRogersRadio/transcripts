One thirty-five, a Wio-D, we've had some real brain surgeons here today, those of you who are really listening because you want to learn something, you've learned it today. Boka! Yeah, Neil. Yeah, listen, I look at this morning, Barney's sound very sexy, what does she look like? One thirty-six a Wio-D, let's go to Miami. Hello. How are you doing Neil? How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Well that's good. I'm doing especially good if you're looking at the, uh, I'm not going to, I'm not going to, I'm not going to do it on the fourth, too long bird, I just want to make a, too much Squawr, it's foul. Just one comment for the medspan, that's there for the cups of your own again, just looking at how I want them well and over four. Yeah, you're sitting about two thirty, can I leave? No. I'm sitting about two thirty. Two more quick death bird. I wonder who you'd rather have leading off, your own Walton or one Sam well. Uh, not leading off maybe, uh, not a set of all games. Maybe, uh, bank with a first answer, something, so I'm, one Sam was going to speed. Yeah. No, thanks for good three for five and Roger P. D. L. T. Z. G. G. and so on. I think the meds, uh, organization ought to be listening and maybe they can learn something to do. Yeah, well they got David Conpich in the night, so, um, my Josh shouldn't score more than twelve or thirteen runs. Well they're the team of being the first inning. They're the team to beat. You're right. All right. See you. One thirty seven of the WIT. At least three of you started, okay? He didn't mean it for you started. What do we got? Everybody for lightning round? I guess that means we got to play something, right? What could we play that would take up some good time? Why would you sit back and relax and you're ready to go home? Oh, here's a good thing for the guy with the apinis problem we call me for. And what do they have to do? Why can't we make a wish for you, why can't we make a wish for you? Well there's your lot of stuff and we haven't played in a long time. That I used to hit that on INZ years ago used to play that all the time. INZ member dancing. Who played it? You did. All. Kick an ass. When you were kicking ass over there midday. They got. Yeah, forgotten it. Yeah. The only thing I haven't forgotten is all the great colors we used to have over there. Yeah, true. Never had an hour like we had. No. They had some real, you know, some people who were with it. We just weren't fixated. It seems like this station has got a bunch of guys who are like fixated on like between their legs seem to be about the only thing they can think about. Which was the same in wins but they were thinking about it in a positive way. These people are all like wishful thinking over here, you know? We haven't played this in a long time. The American cowboy. Tough. Different. Smelly. He settled the west with just a horse. A gun and a whole bunch of beer. Our beer. Zeld and Schlock beer. When Papier had gunned down Billy the Kid. They were both filled with our beer. When Custer conquered him. They rode into the worst ambush in US military history. He just finished a case of Zeld and Schlock-Thombs. Now you can enjoy the time-honored recipe of our founder, Papasel and Schlock. Yes, even though it's harder to make beer this way, out of the back of a chuck wagon from ingredients we find in the cow pasture. We still do it because well, we're stubborn. Stubborn and backward and like Papua, just a little bit local. But that's how you get them. You're not on the prairie. All alone is just a horse and a gun and a whole bunch of beer. Our beer. Zeld and Schlock beer. You'll enjoy a great tradition of the old west. Getting drunk and shooting up the place with Zeld and Schlock beer. Here's another car that I'd forgotten. We should've been using all along, especially the sound. Let's do this car. Ha ha ha ha ha. Boy, yeah. Talk about fitting in like you'd suppose. No, no, no, no. Wait, what are you doing? Don't take what is he doing? They can buy each one of these. You know, I can. No, it's one thing you'd a little carried away. You'd notice he took my cellar yarn here when I wasn't finished with it yet. Man is just out of control. You know, I call you at a restaurant and the waiters or two. Oh, how like my grandmother used to do. She'd make it out of your hand. You'd like you'd have a bowl of soup in front of you. And then whatever she was making for dinner, when it was done, She was coming to shocking. Or it'd prombe. That was amazing. Rower. I'm sorry, I can't say about that. He just brought the bridge to her. Rower. Rower. Ha ha ha. Rower. Blunk your magic corner for all of you. It's foster brown. Or it's obvious. I'll be damned. Date County, hello. That really, really crossed my ass a little. Rower. That you'd swoon. Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm. See what happens tomorrow. Okay. Well, be kind of interested. See what happens. Was it the David Cohen again? Date County, hello. Oh. Yeah. Oh. The best. That's it. I might even call in because I get the sports chat work on a satellite. You know, and I can realize most of the med fans won't be able to see their team lose tonight. So if it gets really bad, I might even call in interrupt the draft show on the air and give them a little report. But I can do that. Well, I'll try. Date County, hello. There. There. There. Palm Beach. The two-lade verge are already a dickhead. Broward. Radio personalities aren't ugly. So tell us something we don't know, John. Broward. Roseful, Jerry Ballas. Date. Not only does the team suck, each wall is. Boko. Date, best time, same bet champs. Broward. Oh, that's the fourth round. Zeta. Too bad we couldn't play a little bit more of that, but we can't re-brog cast their signal. Okay, sorry. Broward. No, I got an idiot. That must be the cone on top of his head. It's all about, oh, of course. The match is sheets. Date. I killed him. Palm Beach. There. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. God, are they good? I'm good. Great. They're not just good. They're good.

All right, little draft preview. Now we're finally getting something top of the Volca. Volca. There's a wine dry. You see, this is it. Bob Murphy, Jr., recognize that voice anywhere. Broward.

Boca, retail, when properly translated me, Tom, a cheap, nasty, tentcha stitches. Worth, we're out. They don't come any faster than ankle burn. Which question? Dave. So, it's just a dickhead. Broward. Hello. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Dave. Hear me. Hear me. Haha. A little preview of NBA Dracking Out of the Buses. It's got 610. Your sports obsessive station. Where it's more than a game. It's a sickness. And last but not least, in Boca. Yeah. Right. I was good. Kind of like a little emphasis there. It was worth her feeding, right? Awesome. And heavy sounds like an incredible day. Steve's got open and close next. And then tonight, don't really got the NBA draft for as long as we can milk it. To like the wee hours of the morning. So stick around for that. It's going to be shameful. What it's going to be. Well, it's still going on. Speaking of shameful. Tomorrow morning on the Nickbring Show. It's May. Re. Maybe if they just spent more time selling donuts. That is calling the show. They've done some business. Boca. Deal. Yeah. Burned. I was going. Terrific. Hey, listen. I've got a town. How was the doorplay? How'd she look? Great. Um-hmm. Biscuit bird. Like on a PBK. You look kind of asking a question. Seriously, goodnight. Are you married? Yeah. You're married. Is your wife like holding out on you or something? He's getting hot. No, that was going to be my next question. He's anticipating. I mean, you're obviously not getting enough. Because when you have to start fantasizing about voices that you hear on the radio, I'm telling you. I mean, she's a very attractive, nice lady. She's not raccoel, well, and she's not the Harry Belafonte's daughter who's name I can ever remember, whatever name. If she's very attractive and nice and all that. But she's, you know, she's all right. You're a little like, yeah, you're a little like there. But, you know, your wife would have gotten really pissed. Hey, bird. Yeah. How about a man can row a whimbleman? Oh, right. Had a rough time to get to that. But you want? How about nothing, credit? Well, that's true. 208 after 11 at WIOD. We have an open line in Boko, where that's bonehead just hung up exactly. Textbook case of a terminally boring. Okay. If you say terminally boring, it's trust me. When I'm not here, you can talk all the tennis that you wanted to take off. Six months to get the audience back. Okay. Fantastic. Hello. Yes, Neil. How you doing? Great. It's who? It's bird gym. It's bird gym. Yeah, how much? It's only a wimble thing. Yeah, your pirates are really exciting boys. I don't know. No, wait. I got to shut your microphone in a second. We got to have some balance here. Now, we don't have to have any balance. It's my show. There's nothing to balance. Okay. You're just a flunky over here. Okay. Just keep that in mind. Because Todd is ready to move in at any moment. So, I went by last Saturday, but the place was so damn. They didn't stop. Yeah. I just walked away. You might as well was really incredible. It sure was. They, um, oh, by the way, Billy Blam did thing that song. That's a little girl down. It wasn't Bobby Blam? No, Bobby Blam sang a next time he's seen it. I got about 10,000 records anytime he needed. Really? Well, I stand corrected them. Yeah. If you're a domestic of the year. He sounds like being in this morning. All time, you know. I'm getting the same problem, you know. 48, and uh, set him here lately. I don't know. Mm-hmm. How about that, uh, mac and roll? I know what's the clock. What's the clock? Not interested to see. Hey, Neil, we went to Vegas last summer. Yeah. With a hundred and twenty-one, the day we got there. Mm-hmm. I don't think I'm going there in a summer time. I hate to break the news, too. You go there anytime. It's always great. Because you stay inside all the time. It's air condition. There's no problem at all. Yeah, but if you try. The comfort level is incredible. You try to go just make doors. The windball in 20 miles. Right? We were there one day when there was a wind, a dust storm? Yeah. I was incredible. I've never seen anything like it in my life. And all those street lights went out. You know, and they were swinging around in the wind. I mean, it was like a hurricane we'd seen. I've never seen anything like that. But it only lasted about an hour. Yeah, right. And they were. I think they do that on purpose. They got some kind of advice to make everybody go inside and gamble their brains out. Well, I had to laugh. The guys on a radio were paying. But it's so beautiful. I got a fan. I'm just kidding me. The whole week we were there, the low. The night was like a hundred and five. I have a feeling you lost your money. No, no. I didn't. I sat. I went nuts. I sat in the charna. I sat across the street. It's just for me to watch all the games. But everything I went nuts. What? Because the pirates didn't forget it. You know. But oh, we're awful. Even the fact that you can't. Wait a minute. I keep hearing about watching. But I don't hear anything about gambling. No, no. I don't. You don't gamble. Get out of here. He doesn't gamble. He went to Vegas. He said, that there he did all. He went to the, the seizures. He went to the start of, but he doesn't gamble. What is that? Is that something disgusting that we can't put on the air? The top 10 list. Top 10 things the bird should never do. Bye, a house. Is that the bird's hand? Take credit for any of Neal's ratings. For example, ratings with the bird six to a seven without the bird over ten. Take a big hand. Get out of here. So that's why. I know it's wrong, but I'm just reading. Do you have to respond to all of these? Are they, do that insecure? Number seven. Get six so that someone would have like, Ernie, E.J. Joey, Meg Green or anyone else fills in. E.J. Oh, it's easy. What an idiot. Six. So I'll build Carter to fill in. Five. Tell jokes. Four. Air petty grievances against other people in the business. We're joining with Neal's criticism. The stink Steve Hank, Tom, etc. Three. Get up. Two. Try to do the lightning round without Neal. And number one, I'm going to list the things the bird should never do. E.J. Superior to Lee, Alice, Steve, Meg Green or anyone else for that matter. What a door. What a door. Oh, boy. Is that the one that called, so they sent the great facts. It must be. They don't get anything on a fax machine, but, um, either sends all those entries from all the tracks and from fingerlinks. And the reason we can't get anything else, uses all the paper up. That's the worst top ten list I've ever heard. I'm going to go over and look during the break. I've just covered the pot. I'm going to install. Hello. Hi. Hi. How are you doing? Good. Who's this? Brian. Brian. Brian. Brian. Good. What's your deal? Yeah. Saturday at home. The Yodam Hollywood. Yes. Brian. Danny. Danny. Yeah. Aaron, I was wondering. Are you in fact rich related? Yeah. Are you guys? Where are you? Identical twins. No. No, because you guys look like a bomb. No, we do. Right up to Pat Rich and go. Finally. Yeah. He felt like a jerk didn't he? Yeah. Yeah. And my brother, Danny, do you want to say, is that the French cigar? Do you remember? Oh, yeah. Danny's okay. Yeah. He's a little bit more black. And you're the one with black here. Well, whatever you say, what's your name again? Brian. Brian. That's what I thought it was. Oh, look at this. We got a whole bunch of stuff on the facts machine. Brian. No, we'll any of that. Just don't bring it to us because they're too busy getting ready to eat our lunch. I like to say I had a bomb and call my brother Danny at the or Danny or Thor. Okay, Brian, and you know something? Yeah. You're right. See you. Hi, I'm Brian. I'm 33. I don't know why I'm D. Here's the thank you for turning us out of the return of Dion. Your Frankie's a great album. And it says. Turn people on to real music on our timers. Especially here in embommed beach land of the living day. Oh, this is in Palm Beach in Palm Beach. Tell me. Yeah, that's a boy there. Right. Don't pitch about Dayton Broward because you don't know what you've got. True. So you lose it as Ralda and I would say as they say over it. I hear it. Bones. Montel. Mm-hm. That's what it was. In Carl Spring. Oh, there's a new one. Another first class hotel. Come to oral springs is a place from the Royal Springs Mall. And adult playtime unveiled as artist contraception of the ambitious project that will the Bones Swamot. Tell us already established the name of a pupa. Isn't that the one where they have like the water beds in the end? You know, you know, you rent by the hour. What do they call it? Rounds. Right. Freak, more accident injures man. You're not going to be able. I think there could be some pain involved in listening to this. But this is from the Milwaukee Gazette from the A.P. A man who lost part of his penis in a lawnmower accident. Ouch. Was in satisfactory condition after the organ was attached to his arm until it can be reattached. They hospital spokesman said it was attached to his arm until it can be reattached. And he said, gee dad, it was a war. The details of Saturday's accident are sketchy, but apparently the man in his mid-30s was making repairs underneath the tractor-type mower when he was injured. So James King, a spokesman for Friedrich Memorial Lutheran Hospital in Wawa, Tosa. The tractor was on blocks at the time of the accident. Attaching the organ to the man's arm allows it to receive blood. So the tissue will not die. So a lot of you old guys up there like in sunrise and tamaract, this could be a real boom for you if we can just kind of cut it off and attach it to your arm. So the tissue will not die. Okay. And then when you get the opportunity to use it, just kind of like going to the nearest bar and tie one on. Wow. Wow is right. A real, that was a real cutting experience. A lot of 35 at Wawa do you want to say about wings plus four they are doing a business up there now like you wouldn't believe because they become legendary. There are some places that become, we've been some cigars. What a guy. I brought me a box of cigars and even sent it matches. Oh, these are heaven. I don't think we could survive the almost eight months. I don't know. I don't know. All of the food is been great. Yeah. These are like special. Dying and going to heaven. Do you get your little bag Roger? I don't know. I don't know. I was birthed beer in here. Maybe you didn't bring a little bag. Kind of bring us much. We are. Well, no, we didn't want it. I don't want you on the urchin. Does that get some people real upset? I'm going to be too much to need to start belching and too peeing and doing bad stuff. I didn't even have to tune in. I had to tune in. I had to tune yesterday. Same old, delching and the same old talking. Someone give us a break. Oh, you did get your little bag, Roger. You have a little faith. There's a call in Fort Lottodale. Yeah. How are you going, buddy? Great, pal. Good. I'm a big kid. I see what's going on. And not much, dude. I'm a big metman, but I don't have to sit. I heard you say they walked in the next running. That rated two. Well, it was incredible because Montreal left eight runners on base in the last three innings. But they finally got to, I don't, I wasn't panning the attention because I was afraid to pass out, but they didn't finally score in the bottom of the 14. Man, you know, I'm not a person who claims everything on a man. But I've been saying that you didn't get to get her to see me. Yeah. How do you know about it? Much about baseball as a bird. I'd tell you who they should have traded. And you were too ago. It was strawberry. They could, you know, while he was still good. Remember they were going to get a lot of people for strawberry boy because, you know, he's the biggest, well, he's not playing his injury now. He was going to be the biggest lo-for and the biggest wasted time. A big cry baby. And I'd tell you that trade they made with a silly boy. I've taken worst every day. It is one Sam well. He's got like two hits and about 25 advance for the match. Thank you. Aaron of the league. Yep. At 37. What can I tell you? That's yours. Did you watch any of the draft? Oh sure, yeah. Are you a heat fan? No. Are you not an NBA fan? Not an NBA fan, if I mean, I hope that he's too great, you know, because it's my amy, but I'm just not an NBA fan. Well, they got a deal. Blend right. It's going to be the best set out of that. Well, I heard a little bit about that in Wild for six or seven hours last night. They didn't even know enough on it. Yeah. They helped to rehash the deal. They said if Blend right soon, the job is going to bring in Jim Wright. And if he can't do it, they'll bring in Donnerwise. That would be good. Yeah, that'll spice the crowd up a little bit. Yeah. Yeah, I'm on my way to Paul the right now. Where? I'm going to go hit the pick to pick hopefully. Good. Got anything from the doubles? I'll have money for the pick to. And the double knock. I wouldn't give you a, I looked at those names, man, and the double knock just to pick a pin and like you know, hold your eyes. Take the program and run your finger up and down and just stop when it feels good. But I should. I'm hearing that when I handicap my lose. I just do that. So just stand and be saying. All right. You do that or try to get in touch with Phil. Hold mark your program. You'll be ready. No trouble. That's the guy. I'll look for him. Okay. Thanks. Good luck. Take it easy. Anyway, hey, we have a little less something here for you. Look at that. He's got my check. Would you like one or two of these? Please. One or two? Here. Come on. Take another one.

And they were like, they had two stacks on the desk on the big desk in the middle and they were like, one for you and I don't know what that meant. There's Andy who probably could use an turret. Probably. I would like one of these. I'll see. I got three left. I'm going to have two of them. Are you going to share? Are you going to give one a turret? Are you going to eat all yours? Because I gave two of them to Gary. Of course it was for my check. Now I'm not going to give yours away if you're going to get surgery. One. Would you give up one? Well, see now there's other people.
