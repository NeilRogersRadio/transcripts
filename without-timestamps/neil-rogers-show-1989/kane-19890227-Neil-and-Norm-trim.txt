great one okay uh... evidently some wild stuff is gonna be breaking between now and six o'clock and uh... to give you a clue of some of the stuff that's gone on here's a real well we're not going to do a two three thirty but uh... norm camp who's our attorney is on his way here and we have an affid david which will be talking about three thirty and share is a process of inviting the media in here i mentioned this morning when i came on here about the hollywood police department and they can uh... you know pretend uh... in their own self-righteous way that uh... there in the right and that they're not doing anything wrong etc. and so on but i have a copy of the staff of the right my heart little hand in the essence of it is that uh... there is at least one individual and perhaps it goes deeper than that within the hollywood police department vice section who are out to nail the arraggies in other words try to catch me in some compromising situation even to the extent that they were willing to pay off or bribe somebody to allow them to put me in that kind of situation uh... you know again like i said this morning there are people who think that all of this is like some kind of a game or it's a joke or it's some you know lots of fun or whatever uh... this is like something out of nancy germany this is fascism this whole which i think that's going on and this is just another component of it uh... you know again whether the all of the items are related or unrelated doesn't make any difference because i'm still a target of it and your name is mentioned interestingly not in this but uh... just kind of in passing and i have a feeling that the you could also possibly been the target of the witch on if it would have applied and uh... i just don't think the audience out there the people in this community uh... martyred seriously enough and understand what's going on i think after three thirty double into one to stay well uh... it'll be good to get this stuff out but i have you know my you know where i come from on this i really believe that no matter what breaks in a matter where it's a you put it at your self in a breaks out and how and i'll be well how you put it well you said we put out one breakers yet another brush back has it to me uh... i as i see it i i suspect that behind all the brush fires there is one but you know what reminds me of i find the boy who cried wolf syndrome because you know after you've been caught with your hand the cooking your enough times even if your hand isn't the one and even if you didn't feel a cooking is on a wednesday afternoon people still are going to assume that you're the one because you've done it so many times before that you don't have any credibility left okay because the question comes into my mind is why would the you know hollywood police department on their own are butrarily just decide we're going to get the old rodgers and as you mentioned i can't read their mind but of course there are a lot of homophobes in a course is which on handsman a campaign of homophobia and uh... that's why i resent very bitterly anybody calling me a bigot i mean that's again like uh... somebody who said in this chair a week ago said here and called me a bigot that's one of the greatest insults in a history of mankind okay that would be like that would be like eight off hitler calling somebody an anti-semite i think the other tip off to what i'm saying is another was as to you know what's who is you know behind this whole thing is the very fact and that it's more than just what you call homophobic uh... you know an exercise in homophobia is the fact that evidently they were interested as to whether i you know had gone there too and of course the only link between you and i happens to be our common yeah and coro animals who is at the discredited both of us and see that's that's that's a good point yeah that's a good point why the hell with the how even if the Hollywood police were for whatever reasons homophobic and that to get you why would the question come up with a dk never you know i mean that's i think there's your answer yeah that's a very good point yeah well anyway uh... norm is on his way here as we speak and uh... i i think cita but good thing about i think what's happening is that it's all becoming public now and it's all getting out there for people to say and we had a we had a choice i mean norm you know told me obviously we could have just gone ahead and passed this on to state attorney and brought in done a very quietly and uh... i don't choose to do it that way because quite frankly i think you know you know you have to stand up for something sooner or later and today couldn't have been a better day for it you know i was to get to save a day when the break it today because like i said in the year this morning i've had it i'm not taking any more abuse from anybody and uh... this is this is the end of it as of today i mean from now on it's going to be completely on the offensive and if there are people like this detective who think that they can play games with my life or your life or anybody else's life and try to you know it's written trapped people into what could be a horrendous situation neck of destroy their lives that's just a good happen and i'm not going to allow it to happen well i'm a big believer in the light of day and i think that the plus i think the public has a right to know i i personally believe that as i said with it over the last two weeks that the thing which is aimed at you and which is aimed at me is basically and in getting us all here which is basically and to our audience and if they're trying to take away shows that our audience like our audience have a right to know about that because well in my case it goes beyond just getting the off the air because when people in my neighborhood get letters people who are my neighbors in plantation are getting letters from someone who live not even the same county down in coral gables giving them my real name and telling them that they could be in a compromising situation on the air and i'm going to have my way and it just generally trying to create affection between me and my neighbors in my own neighborhood where i live so it's not obviously disconnected with something that's on the air it's connected with the desire to ruin my life okay and also to get you and to give me out of time i do believe i mean and as i've said and testified to the fact that the overall objective is to remove you from tachos quite frankly i think if you move to Seattle tomorrow i think your problem is that individual with and it says my new one is my own going anywhere okay i've got real news for him i'm not going any place all right real cool and see you it gives you uh i can't really call in my amy over the weekend well it gives you an idea of what to store 330 Norman can't will be here and uh along with the rest of the press i was going to stand excited and that's not really exciting a horrific announcement and you'll want to stay soon for that you're listening to the cc intro 610 wio d will be back after the news just gonna turn the mic over to you okay well first i i have to tell you i have to do one little little plug i have to thank Aaron C. Renekar for getting me a vehicle and i have to know just like i said i was coming down here i was on my way down and as i got off the elevator it kicked in and i had left my car for somebody worked this morning up in pompano beach and they were able to come through so i think and for i want to say at the outset when i hear for hype when i hear to publicize something unjustly this has nothing to do with the city of palandell and it has nothing to do with uh and attorney who uh individuals are embroiled in grievances with that's european that we know that we know of that we know of we we are here and i am on the air uh sharing with you a revelation concerning and alleged impropriety by the city of palandell police department perhaps the broader and greater issue that this addresses is one of uh freedom of sexual belief and freedom of sexual practices and individuals who we will refer to as john do because there's no reason to uh broadcast his name unnecessarily at this point was uh acting as a clerk in the Hollywood cinema theater oh i don't i think it's called the cinema twin theater last Friday night at that time the venue to the vice intelligence and our constitutive of the Hollywood police department executed search warrant of that premises and effect you aided and arrest of this individual earlier this morning Neil went on the air saying he believed he was being harassed by a number of people and this individual on his own contacted the station and then the station advised him to contact me he relayed the following statement to me which my office prepared into an affidavit i want to say the asset that uh we have turned this affidavit over to the proper authorities for their appropriate review uh before i even arrived here the Hollywood police department has uh been given a copy of this affidavit as has the state attorney it will be bad determination uh as to whether or not it should be taken with uh the appropriate credence that i believe it should and they will have to make the determination of how to proceed that's not for us but because it is so revealing it's not felt necessary um and i'm sorry Neil felt it necessary Neil was given a choice and as he said on the air i was listening in the car on the way down he was given the choice of uh going on the air with this or not going on the air with this uh i'll tell you a consequence of it later on because just going on the air with this some police agencies would have you believe as a violation of flour and statute because there is a statute that suggests if you go on the air with any internal investigation of a police agency or something to that effect that's a misdemeanor however that statute is now being challenged and court by myself the american civil liberties union and has already been declared on constitutional most out any any other hesitation this individual who was arrested during the course of this search associated with what let's do this because that's a good kind of intro we have to take a short break when we attack you can just get into the uh this affidavit which is really the uh the justible we're here to talk about today you listening to the state ten minutes that radio six hundred w i d uh norm needs five four minutes so i'm just going to give this thing right back to him uh if you want to take about thirty seconds to kind of sum up and bleed into what you're doing here and as i said uh we're here to share with the public information provided uh to me in an affidavit from uh in all caronolates in gentleman in rste somebody who working in the synaid twin theater in hollywood florida on Friday night was arrested uh he called me this when i was working on other legal issue and this is affidavit to get this is a just affidavit cut right to this we're up on the court me to say that uh after the offices uh came in to the premises the bookstore they began harassing him as as offices with vice intelligent and narcotics often do by saying how could you work here what kind of establishment is there to charge you out of bed and off i can't remember it's not a bookstores a movie theater there are no peatios or no a quarter movies it's a movie theater okay um it's dark i'm aware of that it's a movie theater and they went in there asking this person how could he work there and they were at executing search warrant a lawful apparently a lawful search warrant at that time to seize two or three different films they said what were kind of people coming here how can you work here and the response from the individual who was arrested said uh we get many tourists in here we get elderly people we get professionals we get engineers we get other people from all walks of life uh in fact he said we even have Neil Rogers sometimes comes in here uh the aphean says that uh at the moment they mentioned Neil Rogers name everybody seems to turn their head that they were fascinated by it once he mentioned the name of mr. Rogers the aphean goes on to say that the attitude of all the officers dramatically changed he indicated that they went from being nasty to being friendly he indicated in his affidavit then they asked whether or not Steve King whether or not Steve King also patronizes that establishment he answered no and then they did not ask any further questions about Steve King the police mostly one thing were detective then asked how often mr. Rogers came in how many nights mr. Rogers came in what he did when he was there and commented according to the affiant that Neil is there probably trying to pick up young boys he stated this was pretty much the extent of the conversation at that time after being booked and jailed in Hollywood the affiant then advised me that he was taken out of his cell by a singular detective and the detective represented to him that he was out to male mr. Rogers and advised him advise the affiant to call the detective the next time Neil Rogers came into that theater if he did so he was promised money he said there would be quote dollars in it for me while the detective failed to say specifically how much he would be paid he indicated that the officer implied if you were to call the theater when mr. Rogers was there they would take the necessary steps to eventually affect your way to arrest against mr. Rogers for engaging in illegal sexual activity the affiant indicates that he never saw anything other than the orages being a normal customer but the officer from the Hollywood police department is alleged to have quote said he wanted to nail mr. Rogers the officer then told the affiant that he should not tell anybody else about this or that life might become miserable for him but the affiant decided to have the courage of the tinnacity and the the on the ladies and gentlemen to call my law office this morning to relay this scenario to me I asked him to come in to sign a statement to that effect and he has done so we're at the top of the hour we've only about 30 seconds left to end this if these allegations against the Hollywood police department are true against this officer are true does this break a number of laws and could you just then like 20 seconds tell us which ones it would it would be breaking well let's face that offenses are allowed to pay informants for interrupting criminal activity but they cannot solicit that criminal activity to occur they cannot engage one to induce another to engage in criminal activity and it would appear to be a major and propriety by the Hollywood police department we are going to break for the news of the top of the hour will be better and still on and your response was well if other people were saying it they would might be they might just be kidding but I know Neil and my Neil says that he means in reference to this alleged trolling for boys whatever whatever boys is a maturano what boys is because boy I mean 18 year olds can be boys but by the definition of law in fact 17 year olds by definition of law are the you to consent in the state of Florida how do you react to that statement is that well I'm blessed come up with yeah I don't know anything I've ever done a just let's just deal with it and put it to bed once I'm for all okay I like that that that's you're gonna shut your mouth sir you're gonna shut your mouth and let me reply to what you're saying or you're not sure let me know because if you're not I'll just hit the button now we're applied with you all the air I'd rather you have you on there right I have said that in the show I did with Jack Thompson I found I was very uncomfortable with what Neil was doing on the air with Zeta in that particular area of knowledge you really want to go into the whole and when the guys would come into the studio and you're talking about the sitting at your lap and done tongue and cheek but quite frankly in my opinion I didn't know how much it was how about when Glenn was talking about the young girls who came in and literally sat on his lap now about that did that body oh I mean I don't why did I why the separate because first of all and I you know that there were no guys sitting on my lap okay you really believe that you're asking me a question and I'm gonna answer it I'm not right I'm not saying I'm right you're asking me to be honest I mean I wish that's for asking you what I've been but you really believe I were giving you my answer you want to say that sure I'll give you a straight as well I listen pardon the palm pardon the plan was when I listen to that show to be very honest for you I was uncertain in my mind is to I know when you're kidding and there are times when I don't know if you're kidding or not but you said that's what I've been a bit knowing that I've been in the business this long do you think that I would bring anybody into the studio and do anything even covertly sexual and the studio of course in my day for you that wasn't what I was talking about what I was saying is I didn't know how much of it was kidding and how much was that's all I was in the queueing you're having sex in the studio well as jmycles would say it was just a joke well okay I know you better now than I did then I'm prepared to believe that in those days I didn't know you so well and there were a lot of stuff that I had heard that my original question I'll excuse me sir they quite frankly now that I know you better I don't believe that at the time I did and that's what I said okay we go back to the staff the day that one second because detective Murray says according to the affian he says Neil is probably there meeting in the adult theater to pick up some young boys now I could be mistaken but it seems to me that the law in all of the states in this country says that x-rated theaters don't allow anyone of the age of 18 in fact many of them don't permit anyone on the beach of 21 to enter the theater under penalty of losing their license to operate at cetera so again this term young boys I'm not sure exactly what that means well I understand what you're saying but I want to get back to what this caller is talking and I wanted between you and I wanted to get back to your original purpose of your call so what what is your point sir because I want to deal with it original purpose of my call is how less moral legal on a moral basis are you guilty of doing the same thing what is the same thing I have no idea what you're talking about obviously you made the same thing about Neil I think detective has said to me I think I can answer that sir I certainly think we can make a distinction the issue here is that the detective has a badge I haven't had a dime I'm not talking we have to tell you but I'm telling you the difference and it's not a legal issue just just absorb it for a second the issue is that the detective if the affian is to be you know if we're taking the same in his true the detective has a badge he has a gun he has the power to arrest he has the ability to initiate a prosecution he has the ability to start a process that could ruin somebody's career destroy their reputation and perhaps take away their absolute livelihood I better think I better let go of what I want I want to understand exactly what I did that you're rejecting to what I did was state my opinion that what Neil was doing in my opinion which in it I made very clear in no way you know should be definitive as to what Neil should be Neil should be allowed to do whatever management permitted him to do that I found it in bad taste and I didn't know when he was kidding or when he was no what the hell's wrong with that sir that was my opinion you have a problem with that if I do well let's go to Miami you're on W I don't and I hope that clears the air between us because I'm not your enemy and we were enemies and there was an old saying that goes back I'm not saying I acted in me I'm not bad we can come here let's go to another show let's let's let's say this and then we'll then you reply okay there is I'm not saying that everything I did if I had it to do over again I would do again but there is an old saying that isn't old saying because it has a lot of validity and that is in life the enemy of my enemy is my friend and I think it was that dynamic that basically created whatever reports is to between jack tops and then me you had said in those days some horrendous terrible things about me and they were not personally not personally no now I don't really want to relive it how many of you want to comment that you attribute a to me that I allegedly made about Rachel I never made that comment I heard it with my own ears but you said always the comment the I want to say this and then I'll get into it the reason I wanted to avoid this is one reason because because what we are doing now is exactly playing into the hands of an individual in Coral Gables and Moments I think you got to clear the air I think we are going to clear the problems there and you're like clear it make a reference to me I heard you with my own ears okay and say you know something about a show I've done I've tried raising whatever was who is he to give advice to other people I'm sure when his child has been an institution talking about Rachel I've tried raising an institution and an institution I heard it with my ears okay now I said then I don't have any such I don't know how the head you said it but she did you were talking about the system okay I said she's an institution or I said that you said who is she said who is he came to give his advice to parents when his kid is an institution I don't remember so I can remember saying who I mean to give advice when his daughter said as many problems or what I can do I can accept the fact that you don't remember I sure don't but you can bet your bippy that I remember it because it's not the kind of thing okay well let's get one more advice I don't okay if I said that then I apologize because I don't I have no knowledge to base that on but let me just clear the air one other thing okay we'll get it all out of the way there was a show you did one of them one of the most not just to me personally with Rick Siderman and Bob Cunst the day you made them booze and buddies and they were embracing each other so to speak and for some reason out of nowhere my name isn't so often didn't those days came into the conversation out of nowhere because there really nothing to do with the topic conversation and Mr. Siderman's comment being the great humanitarian that he is said well you know I guess Bob you're not so bad I don't really hit almost sexual but let's face it Neil Rogers isn't really a homosexual you know that horrible lifestyle in his knees terrible and you're lying about he's so unhappy and he hates his mother he's himself he's a fangard not just a homosexual he's a fangard I found that to be so personally offensive that I can't fool the world absolutely so what did you problem with me late when Siderman was on my show last week he started with that crap I'm not talking about it but I can do it I am not responsible for what my guests say nor are you responsible for your your your participation to be or presiding over the we were involved and have you over the long-sash and you blocked out and for gotten the horrendously horrible things that we said about each other before we were colleagues here at this station surely you you telling me only remember the terrible things that I said about you and that we're of course totally on forgotten and all the things that are great deal of difference between talking about somebody's performance on the air or their ratings rating that professional as opposed to this this low level personal and he is he's my understand all of the others and personal I understand that you have blocked out the personal things that have gone down between us and the past on your end but you have made statements about my mental health and about my capacity about my what my family and about my mom and the ill I mean I own what I do you certainly you certainly the same people out there listening I think you're listening to you when you said you're all right let me just for a moment yeah media isn't it fun why don't you're clients fight just just for a moment let me respectfully suggest that while you two the two of you probably have some grievances that that can't be on the road or some situations that you can discuss that what what happened with the Hollywood police department Friday probably goes beyond the essence of the moment wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute wait a minute no it doesn't go it unhiesed in with it okay because this homophobic crap is gonna stop all right now the idea that you can go on air and you can attack just about anybody else who's ever been invented and you're immediately attacked you can attack black to the end of a way so it comes down on your ass you attack Jews and right away here's our title bomb come as they should okay as they should if indeed you're making an attack I mean if it species that's another story but you know if you come down and you call gay people faggids or anything out of the sun nobody comes down on your ass because in this society it's still acceptable to call gay people airly tydenay mud of the sun and a column faggids I agree with that so about a minute that's what one of the guy who was me you what we're gonna break try to make the can we have people we're excited we have to the world in the situation we're talking about now we have to break okay because we're about two minutes over on our break and we'll pick up where we left off when we get back but I gotta clarify something in mind might we've known each other on an alternate different degrees of closeness over a period of seven years do you think come home of phobon subconsciously yeah we'll talk more about that so get back let's talk about that you're listening to the Steve Kansha six time I come in that I'm not home of phobon because them I can best because of a single act so I'm gonna single act of you you basically can be because of my friend I don't think well I'll explain you do all of you let me ask you this to all your friends are all living rules or progressive no far from it but but they also I don't I don't associate with anybody who I consider would be a right wing big it I couldn't do it I would have nothing in common with them I would find them to be totally distasteful excuses for human beings and I just couldn't spend any time with them well I mean nothing to be I'm not talking about I have friends or conservative not ultra right we will not see we will be back with the quote boy people have done for us to get into it you're listening to the Steve Kansha six ten wioji an hour left we're back with you six minutes after five o'clock uncle Neil Rogers norm Kent our mutual attorney and I am Steve Kansha for gotten who I am now we let's just let's get we have an hour left if we results our differences or what where are we as far as I know I think we cleared it out okay Mr. Kansha I think you know the Abraham Lincoln once said the best way to defeat an enemy is to make him a friend what's really at stake here one of the best points that Neil's making and let's just go back and reflect upon some of the things that have happened here at the station over the past few months you did something that antagonized the group of black people and the NAACP is suddenly a voice to be heard from in dealt with if you do something that offend Jewish people before you know at the anti-deformation league is is here in force when people go ahead and say something about eating animals the next thing you know my good friend Lonnie Wiggins is here with the animal rights activists and if you say something about how in doubt why the the great caucus is is here in force the senior citizens what Neil is saying and I think it's true I see this professionally I see this personally is that it gave people our targets for for everybody without having a force to speak for them they are repeatedly slanted on the air they are liable they are humiliated and exposed to public ridicule without having somebody speak up for them as as a force I like to think that I speak up as as a professional I think we all ought to speak up as persons to prevent that kind of gay bashing on the air and that's probably what this is about and that's why this this allegation is so disturbing it doesn't suggest that they're out to get Steve came because he decided to go do something with his wife on a beach you know I've represented in ten years of being a criminal defense lawyer in brow account I have probably represented 200 to 300 to more individuals gay gay individuals that get picked up for soliciting all the gay people are living in heterosexuals that's not just agree with you I mean I agree with everything you're saying however I think there's more involved here because if it's a homophobic thing what I want to know is why the device squad the Steve fit to ask whether Steve can attend to this movie there well because it wasn't just it wasn't just a homophobic thing but that's the point that I'm trying to make here there's more to it that means you I think we can all agree with there all that point one might one might want to ask where the the vice squad to begin with chose to raise the issue of Steve and Neil and we're gonna get the names from who created the kind of conditions that permitted and no doubt at the appropriate time you will ask detective Murray that very question I'm sure we'll add a card at some point sure whoever winds up representing Mr. Hill will engage in that kind of inquiry okay let's go to Miami you're on WIOD hello
