Rogers, to get a touch-in-talk, call 751 WIOD in-day. 524 WIOD in-rullard, or 655 and 278 WIOD in the fall beaches. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neil Rogers, on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD. I'm a captain, and a good man, and I trust you, Artil. Hey! Where are you? My fiance! Hey! Hey! He's got a girl! He's given a gift! Oh, my son! The game is by! Holy cow! Oh, oh, oh! Don't be, but get your dick. Lock it in, on 100.3 S.M. I'm going to be something you've never said anything all day. Let's just get the check and leave, okay? It's 10-07 WIOD, but that JD Roberts did a great job this morning. Wasn't he good? Yeah. And like I said, do a Roger in a couple of other folks. When you're bringing a real broadcast, you're going to feel in it really turns out to be good. I'll be damned. A real honest to God, Broadcaster, and a good one. He's good. Anyway, don't expect it to continue. Because we probably got some real winners falling in the next week, but it was a good start anyway. Steam today has baby-selling part 2. I know that most of you probably don't believe that, but it's true. With Richard Dimitro and Chad Dornseif, an adoptive father and grandfather battle it out over baby crystal in. Crystal in. I thought she really did crystal gale. I don't know about that whole thing. I don't know about that whole thing. I'm sure it's a very interesting show for people who are interested in baby-selling. I'm sorry. It's just not my thing. Steve said the other day. And it's true. He's obsessed with babies. And what's the other one? Borsion. Well, that's part of the baby thing. Oh, this is good and loud again here today, isn't it? Baseball cards. Baseball cards. Babies with a B. I think it begins with a B. Baseball cards. Babies. And what else begins with a B? Beauty pageants. Stuff like that. But anyway, that's on a can show. Then we got Mr. Plunder himself who was in a building getting his chair. That'll be gone by six o'clock tonight. Hank Goldberg and Joe's a Gaki. I don't know. Joe's not going to be here. He's on vacation, isn't it? I heard him say last night. Now, I'm serious. You don't know? No, Joe will not be here. I don't think. I thought he said last night he's leaving for vacation today. And by the way, that's what Steve did yesterday. He has such a trouble maker. He comes in here. I want you to say this. I want you to say that. Do you remember him saying that specifically? I'll have crap about Joe. I don't know anything about Joe. And the less I know the better. OK. He's a great guy. I don't know how he has a wonderful vacation. And then we got the Yankees at Kansas City tonight at 8 o'clock. But real bonus, no Bush Bingbang. And that's the agenda, of course, followed by what's the question at the... After the game. Am I going to be a Toyota of Hollywood? We're all going to be out there. It's going to be tremendous. We're going to have some of the chronics catered away in the police van. And it's going to be real of that. Trust me. We'll be happening. OK. But at the meantime, we got four hours to kill. Now, I'm curious. I don't want to make a big stimulus about this. But I wonder who is going to handle my check today. Now, those of you, like the one guy in the lighting round, where's my check? Where's my check? I got news for it. If you worked here and you never knew who was here. Everybody else has got their check. You've got your sitting right there in your envelope. Effortless, different colors in my... Yeah. And a different amount. But I, every Friday is like a mystery. Where's it going to come from? And who's going to be in charge? And who's going to take care of it at center? Boy, it's a major ordeal. So it's easy for you to say out there, you know? But it's a major mystery. So somebody told me that... I don't want anything by the way. Five in a row on the road. Three games in front of the men. It's three and a half in front of my tree all in four ahead of the Cardinals. That's all I have to say. Suck with. Went all the way. Five hit her. Shut out. Two shutouts back to back. That's it. Now, that was painless. Wasn't it? Oh, by the way, we got some horses for Carter because you're going out there today. Mm-hmm. We haven't been picking purposely because I've been just embarrassing myself. Not a day. I'm really going to... I'm going out on a limb. It's a seventh race. I'm picking a horse with Steve Gaffleon, which I've never done. Steve, I'm sure is a wonderful guy. I just don't bet him. I'm sorry. But he's writing Lee's 10th and a seventh. And of course, we've had so much Lee Fowler talk lately that he just couldn't pass that up. And then there's a great... Back to back. Parlay. The bird's picking Oriental Game with Gonzalez in the eighth, which is... How can you go wrong? I couldn't pass it up. Can't pass it up. Oriental Game after that. The male came in the other day with all his disgusting wrestling holds that snatched. Whatever that was. So anyway, that's the tips of Carter today and the good luck to you all. There was a horse came in yesterday in the second race. I'd have been picking, I know I'd have had this. I'm a sap sucker with Larry Salmel. How could you pass that up? Well, that's like... Strames at Carter. You know what's good to do? I would imagine 10, 16 at WIOD. Here's a little thing that Roger just gave us nothing to exciting. What is this? Oh, I see. Why flip through a hundred channels still can't find something to watch? By the way, I do want to mention thank goodness for that Pittsburgh. What do they call it KBL as a name of the cable system? And I didn't tell everybody yesterday if they wanted to see the game S320. And that's where it was last night. All you satellite people. So if you wanted to see that game, that was the only place you'd get it. And those guys who did the game. Oh my god. Horrendus. Who is the Steve Blast? The former pirate pitcher who was so great in the next year is last year. He just lost it. Well, he lost everything. I mean, he can't even speak either. And the other guy was just so boring. It was pathetic. But it was nice seeing a cub score those eight runs. Anyway, it says maybe Willie Nelson can help you starting his own. Cowboy television network. It won't be all Cowboys all the time though. The station will air movie series music videos, live music shows and historical vignettes. The network will start broadcasting a late summer or early fall from Nelson's ranch. Thirty miles outside Austin, Texas. And we have the first promo for the network here. Hollywood, they do do all the day. Terrific. So I guess that's what you'll be doing on it. Network. Now it is true even with the satellite. There are those times. I don't want to burst anybody's bubble because it's great having it. I mean, it's a tremendous thing. And everybody who can get one should get it. But there's still are those times when there's nothing to watch. Isn't that incredible? Even with like a couple hundred channels. There's still are those times when unless you're into, you know, reruns of Dennis the menace and Leave it to be for free. We believe it to be. We believe it to be. Marine acres. And the Andy Griffith show boy. W.G. and it just has a test with the Andy Griffith show. There are promos every 20 seconds for Andy Griffith. That's not like five times a day. I think. There's still the station. Yeah, something like that. Yeah, well Ted Turnier knows got on least three four times. Miami. Hello. Good morning. Yeah. Happy Friday to you. Yes, sir. In this video for Liberty Day because I haven't really heard from the island queen in so long. Oh, so in other words, you're picking the callers now. No, no, no, no. In fact, it's been kind of nice and peaceful since we haven't heard from the island queen. I was just thinking that myself. Well, no, I'm the guy that always calls the lightning round and says, Hello, my name. You know that's from. What? That's from. I'm the 13. Yeah, some sick movie. I was just about to say. Oh, well, anyway, a good happy Friday to you and leave the bird alone on the cubs today. Okay. What do you mean leave them alone on the cubs? He has something to do with the cubs. All I mentioned was they won eight to nothing. They won five and a row. They're three games ahead. That's all I said. I get this impression. He's smiling until you mentioned the cousins. I didn't mention that they had 12 hits in eight walks and had 20 base runners. I could, I mean, if you push me, I'll go on the wall. Yeah, I appreciate you bringing it up. Yeah. Yeah. I was ready to move right on to bigger and better thing. Go in yourself accordingly. Let's see how good Friday. Okay. Wow. Look to think this fits. I'm sorry. If you paid me by the minute, I couldn't watch that show. Really? To me, see, I'm from Lakeland. Oh, yeah. It's right up your alley. Yeah, that's just hot watches at two other kinds of plant city people get into that. Yes. I can't relate to it. And then the one with Avaga Bor in the pig, Zachary Nathas, I can't. I'm not that's even too much for me. Yeah. I just don't understand what this country is all about. And now they're getting this big thing. You watch all the talk shows now. This is going to be the big thing now, but burning the flag. That's a new thing. Yeah. Do you care? I really could care less. Okay. It's gotten no consequence to me. All right. If you want to go out and burn the flag until they pass some silly law. This is another one of those things. You know how quick? Yeah. It's a story. In USC, how quick the politicians jumped on this? Because this is another one of those mom and apple pie things. Oh, man. We got to protect the flag. And right away, there was Bush. Bush doesn't care about all those comies who are killing people, massacring people in China. But if somebody burns the flag, he's going to get indignant really pissed about it. Okay. Well, it's said to you yesterday that Dan Stevens and Tampa on W. Q. Q. Oh, sure. Quittery. People are just going nuts. He says we got 1100 calls in the morning show. It wasn't even a talk show. Yeah. They're just saying absolutely. All you people are really pissed about the Supreme Court, including two of the Reagan appointees. How do you like that? Call somebody. Not Steve, because he's doing the child. What is it? He's a child. He's doing baby cell again today. So, you got any babies to buy or sell? I guess it kind of like trade line. Isn't it? Yeah. I don't know what. I don't understand it. I'm not into it. I'm sure that it's a great topic. I just don't know what the hell he's talking about. But the flag burning thing, that's going to be the burning issue. Because there's not much else going on. Nobody cares about China. In the fact that they're massive. You know, when you got a billion people in the country, I guess, you know, it massacre a few thousand. Nobody cares. They only had 50,000 people over there. People get upset. The flag and Batman. Flag and Batman. Excellent. So, the ex-sonor. We got to see. We got a card on this show for everything, okay? No, this is... Oh, it's a prince. Oh, that guy's a call boy. That's men. What the hell is this? Now they're making Batman movie and they're asking you if I like the score. Got my check here. But I think this is nothing so I would definitely go on. Yeah. How about us from the TV show and edit us down the old group of mine? Now I'll be making so much money. That's the Batman movie. This is awful. I can't even know. Oh, he's dollars, but man. Batman. Wow. I can't even know. This is Batman. Oh, Batman. Oh, man. So I guess that's about as good as the movie from the early reports. Thanks, son. Very nice. Very nice. Very nice. Very nice for these. Jack Nicholson was great. Which I don't agree with you guys. I was so nauseated standing in the hallway. Listening to you guys go on about how great Jack Nicholson is. He's great in cook who's nest. That's the only time in his life. He's ever been great. The rest is the time he's doing a parody of himself. I disagree vehemently. Do you? Absolutely. You didn't like his nest. I loved his nest. He was tremendous. He didn't like him in broadcast. I didn't see broadcast. He said it was so bad. Don't go see. What? Who said that? Everybody. Everybody in the world except you I guess. Boy, he's hostile now. Is there? I never heard anyone say that. broadcast news? Oh, yeah. They all said it sucked. What? It's 23 past 10. 1027, a WIOD. Fancy of Jeff. Oh, Fian say, boy, I love you're spelling this morning, Roger. Well, he's under lot of pressure working with the real protest. Well, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. That was terrible. It's a mic. I didn't mean it. My sound in town anyway, is he? He is. I didn't mean it. No, I just meant that it's opposed to having some hum yonkel come in from off the street to fill in. He had like a real honest to God. I'm not saying anything. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. Who is this? Neil. Oh, hi. I didn't know how I was talking to this is Lonnie Jeff to see on say from the pizza law. Yeah. I just wanted to call and I wanted to be on the air because I know he's listening. You're a pre-business to your program all the time. Well, I'm sure he does. And it's his birthday. Well, happy birthday, Jeff. And I just wanted to have to bring things. Great. I think somebody's got my check in there. Don't you? The money man. Yes, Jeff. We send our best. He's the terrific guy. Great food. Superhuman. Okay. Thank you. So I'll see you those lunches paid off. Thanks a lot. Have a good one. Bye. See if you're feeding the accounting department man. Bring your check personally. Bring it and head into you with a smile on their face. He does smile on around boy. Look at that. No. Pretty good. Okay. 10, 28. Here we go home now. You got your check and I got mine. And like what you called said, the fortune's you got your trouble. And I got mine. Now there's a great record that I almost never hear. Once in a blue moon or blue moon by the Marseilles. See how this show all kind of ties in together. Miami. Hello. I'm right. Do you know what? I'm hanging in the comics. Who really do. So anyway, I think this theme song. This is we should have the American flag. We should have one. No, seriously. One channel on TV where we have the American flag waving, you know, rippling in the breeze with this music in a background 24 hours a day. Call it your all American station. Okay. In all the veterans can watch that, you know, all the old far. I'm not talking about real veterans, but all the old far to think that they fought and every went to war, you know. But the guys with the caps from the VFW and they can stand in salute all day. I mean, this country is so juvenile. There's so much indecimples isn't it frightening? Isn't it? In other words, you didn't go out and kill people or it let kids run around with guns and blow each other's brains out. Nobody really gets too excited about that. But if somebody burns the stink and flag and I'm in a stink and flag, the flag is, you know, it's okay. But it's a piece of cloth isn't it? Yeah. It's a symbol. It's like these people that drive around with their plastic Jesus under dashboard or clutching their rosary beads or their little Lizza on their doorway. You know, geez, why are we going to grow up already? I don't want to start getting into like one of those serious shows. Do I? But I'm getting pretty embarrassed to country where everybody is so juvenile. I want to tell you people going to grow up. It's like that thing that Steve was talking about yesterday with Mr. Wright wing over there with his obsession about what everybody else is doing in bed. What the hell does he care? What is it his business? Why is everybody so concerned with sticking their nose or whatever it is they're sticking in everybody else's business? Well, this is a very, very immature country and just all you got to do is turn on TV and it's a reflection of the attitude of this country. People like good infants. Look at that presidential campaign. Wow. It was a question of which who was going to outwimp the other one. Who was going to use more, I don't want to get into it. Why am I talking like this now? What is this all about? That flag thing gets me so damn pissed off, you know? Oh, well, the first amendment never was guaranteed. No, the first amendment is just for whatever you like, whatever is popular. Okay, that's going to be the new thing kind of like you're not see Germany, you know. But I don't see why they need. I can't understand a constitutional amendment about it. Oh, yeah. We got to protect that flag boy. It's already protected isn't it under the first amendment isn't it already protected? No, you haven't said the point. That's not your message. You've got to point. You've got to backward. They don't want it to be protected to flag burning. They want the flag is like a special thing. You've burned it. They're going to burn you. Okay. So we need to cut 10 years to fry Bundy, but if you burn the flag, we'll fry you in two minutes. Okay. Well, take your vigilantes and we'll hang you from a tree. I mean, I'm not saying you should all go up and burn the flag, but it just what a thing for people to get all excited about. Okay. It's so typical that kind of need jerk and I do mean jerk underlined in red kind of thing that people in this country get all excited about. Got all mighty. We don't even have off track betting in Florida for crying. That's what we ought to be excited about. Right. No kidding. And it putting up those phony things on the lottery up there on those billboards where it says one winner guaranteed 7 million or 15 million. Yeah, they found out last week it was guaranteed one winner. How do you like I heard JD Roberts say this morning? It's true. How do you like to have the winning what you thought was the winning ticket for 15 million? And he fired out there are five winners. I mean, I'm not saying the 3 million is bad, but over 20 years it's not a big deal. Is it? I mean, I guess if you got a separate hotdog stand and that's all you got. It's a big deal, but generally speaking it's not a big stimulus. I don't like that. He's right. The Canadian. That's why I play the Canadian lottery. I'm up to $163 in winnings now. Huh. And the Canadian lottery I invested 700 and some, some still along. No, but it is good at least I'm getting something back. Okay. Thank Goldberg. Oh my god. He's everywhere today. I have a first I want to remind you of McRene showing Sunday. I thought I just saw you in the hall. I got a bill called or spy report. Oh, and I don't want to hear this depressing story about that station went under. Oh, why? I found him. Oh, did you worry? I gave his number to Roger. Oh, listen. I got a call him because there's a station that wants to talk to him desperately. Oh, they did. Where is he? He's in Tampa. Oh, he's just thinking of the gravy placement for Rush Rambo. Yeah. Let's get Bill Carter, but I don't think that's going to happen. Okay. I gave Roger the number and he's there now. Yeah. Oh. Oh, he's in Tampa now. Yeah. Should I call him on the air? Oh, geez. Yeah. He's got like a gun to his hand. Oh, he's great. He's fine. You should hear him. We're talking about Steve and I told him Steve's not funny. Oh, geez. And he said, you know, he's funny. Get you. I said, what? He says, Tampa. Wait a minute. What is he doing in Tampa? He's on his way back from New Orleans. Oh, but he's not working in Tampa. He's not working and he hasn't put he did get an apartment there, but he hasn't signed the lease yet. Well, why did he get an apartment there? You'll have to ask him. Okay. That's a call him. I'm going to call him. I wrapped it up. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Punta's very inspiring for what was it. It was excellent, especially for you. Now listen, Joe's not on tonight is he? I'm on. Yeah, you're nobody says with Joe and Hank. Joe's on vacation, right? Joe's going on vacation. You should have a seat. You might take tonight off. Yeah. He went to somewhere saying like North Carolina is somewhere like that. I got the dog guys on tonight. Talk about the mattress. The dogs? Yeah. This can dog. I love this game. I love Ken Maldon and Bobby Silver's. They're nice people. I'll be over with Jimmy Black and Evan and Andy. I figure we can't do any good at calling Neil May. You're right. I wouldn't get a bring it up. And you know, the best part of it when I value park at this game, they never steal my money. I'll take it right off those poor guys. No, I'm not going to. Hey, listen, it's easy for you to say when you plunge your brains out inside. You don't mind because you're doing it voluntarily. That's because I take all my money inside. I'm going to need it. Okay. Yeah, you're right. It's called her. Okay. Thanks for the report. All right. See you later. Why isn't that exciting? I'm going to call that number any second. Okay. Let's. Are we going to call them? This is going to be great. Okay. Let me do the break. Oh, good. We don't even have anything to do in here. 1035. And W-I-O-D and we'll be right back. I'm like Anthony. Okay. 1038. We have a tip on a horse on line seven. King of dance. Oh, he's laughing already. Here's something I'll get him laughing. Probably the slurry king. Okay. No, call her. What? What? Put it down. Put it down. Okay. It's not that bad. He'll. He's got a gun to his forehead now. It's a matter of fact. It's funny that you would call me. Yes. Because I'm in the shopping center. You know where I am? What do you mean you're in a shopping center? You're living in a shopping center? I'm in my car. It's the end of the last day. Oh, my. So the people are public and let us keep our car in the last. Great. And Mary Ellen goes in the dumpster and gets dinner every night. That's right. But she puts the, uh, oh, I hear her. She's right there. Yeah, she loves you. Oh, my God. Well, I can't. I want to tell you something. A guy called this show about three weeks ago. And he said, Bill Colbert station went out of business. And I said, and I thought it was a prank. I said, you idiot get out of here. And then who was it called a few days ago? Somebody else called and they told me that it was true that something happened. And then I said, I got all the time you want for you. We got a lot of time. Well, I know you have a right show. We did a tight. Yeah. I just want to get as much as I did. That's the company that's tight. Not the show. Yes. Speak to me. I mean, you're my hero. Wait a minute. I got single events phone number. He wants to talk to you. I don't know. I don't know. Wait a minute. I got single events phone number. He wants to talk to you. King of them. We have a vision. We have both cars in the lot at publics. And it's funny that you would call me because I have a sitting here with a gun. Yeah. And Mary Ellen's forehead. I have a gun. And he sang you go first. And I have two bullets to them. Yes. And we decided that whoever goes first, the other one's going to just cop out. Yeah. Well, here's somebody who can use a second bullet on. I'm Mike Anthony. The voice from the past there. Just a joke. Mike. It's just a joke. The station. The station just went under. They did about. Nothing. One three four and they put a shot. A big billboard up on the expressway. The night before they fired everybody. Oh, what did it say? It said to be sure and catch. Oh, what? Bill, what were the call letters of the station? W-O-F-F. No. K-R-U-D. Yeah. Cread. Oh, I think Mary Ellen just went first. The big Cread. Say hello to the old Mary Ellen. I do. Boy, you sound really excited. Yeah, she's still laughing. Boy, I'll tell you these guys. They're so used to it by now. They're nothing bothers them. Boy, here. This man is a walking advertisement for why you should never get in this business. You should have a sandwich board saying, I'm Bill Colter's stay out of the business. Well, I can't. I'm telling you, you ought to write a book. You may think I'm joking. Now, did you get the message from Bob? What's his name? Bob McKe. Bob McKe. What is he? I'm not joking. You didn't get the message? He did. Oh, and you're laughing? Oh, I thought something good was going to happen. No, that's why I'm laughing. What? I don't know yet. Oh, well, geez. Don't be so negative. I mean, you know all these things. Because people when they try to get ahold of you, they always contact me. I say, I don't know these people anymore. We just moved in yesterday. I can't keep track of you. We went out here like three people to try to track you down. First of all, yes. The irony of all of this is that I just got a job this morning. Where? I'm working for Nutri system. Where? Yeah. Really? Yeah. I'm working for Nutri system. I've got, of course. I've got a great deal selling burglow of worms at night. So they don't steal your food? Hello, Glenn. I bill you.

I got to call from, uh, the Jockeys room and high allele on the air. Yeah. And, um, they were all there. Most of them of course you couldn't understand. Yeah. But, um, it was an exciting moment. You know, I'm so tired of writing on your coat. I'm even in New Orleans. I get a call live from higher lea. Great. They say, how are you Bill? I say, fine they said, Neil's doing great. Ha. Oh. Yeah. Well, I am doing great. I'm sure that makes you feel great. I'm going to be carrying on two conversations. My mom is terrific. Tell her I said a law. I still have her home cooking. Now listen, I'm going to, yeah, that's a little hint. I don't understand. So what are you going to do about this? You're going to sit here and do what we've always done. Star.

You know, you're a psychotic friend. Steve. Who's a man who, you know, who's Steve? He's a guy that instituted that famous for his. Yeah. He was the original Denimburg ripped it off. Right. That's right. Yeah. How about my postman? Did you stand my postman call you? Your postman? No. No. No. We're doing great, Billy. Still remember you well. Neil told us a wonderful story about a week ago about your fantasy, about your fantasy and life. About the bus picking up the bus. Yeah. Take out of the track every day with a $500. That's right. Great. I know. I'd be the one driving the bus. That's correct. You know, it's a really valuable. It's just brutal. It's stuff. It's great. Everybody, you want to see what they did on the fourth floor at call. I heard about it. Oh, it's incredible. When you get back here, you got to bring at least two, three thousand because it's incredible. And I'm so impressed by selection. I'm so impressed, Bill, that they named it after you. You know, I just can't believe that. Did you get your pass? Yes, sir. And I got ripped off of Valley Parking for about eight bucks. Oh, it's great. Oh, God. I'm so good to hear about my army. Yeah. I'm going out saying great place, boy. It's exciting. I'm going to be a memory, Bill. Yeah. I'm going to go out and plunge this afternoon. I know. Well, that's wonderful. I saw our Pizzoule on the last ratio. Yeah. That's right. And my Gonzalez had two more winners. It's just incredible. Can you think of Dan? Can you think of Dan? Can you think of Dan's as in a third race today? It's great. I'll be right with you, man. Okay. This is such a thrill. Is it? And nice to know you're not mad at me anymore. What the whole my mad at you about that, I realized. Oh, something about some new-to-system boo. Oh, there it is. And you want to know something funny, I still have the damn food. Yeah. I'm still waiting for it. But my army. Listen, I want you to hear this one more time. I'm my camper. Okay. Just so you can be secure. I'm going to be done here just for me. All right. I got a, I think the burrito. All right, listen. I got a lot of cubs calls coming in here just to get somebody upset here. So look out. All right, I'll call you this afternoon. Are you going to be there? Well, you know me. Yeah, you might be evicted. Well, I'll give it a try. Leave a forwarding number. I'll sleep, I'll be doing it. He's doing great. I'll talk you later. Okay. What? What? Sorry. 1047, a W.I.D. Bill Carter, who really got screwed over by this company. Really bad, no matter what they say. And by lots of others also. We're going to hear that. Funny guys. Funny guy. There are a lot of other people working who shouldn't even be allowed in a building. Anyway, don't forget, make green. I'll be filling in one day for Mike Rinerie. I don't know what it is about her. There's some people you just love. You know, throwing a little stuff every night. And you know what? She just wanted something. Well, I guess it's all of self-serving promos of hers. That's what it is. She didn't call JD Roberts this morning, did she? Oh, no. I heard she did. Oh, God. Anyway, while you're digesting that, I want to tell you about Tragut boy, that you can digest Tragut easily. It's not like the odd you do. You're getting your puppet from eating at those fast food assembly line places. And a reason, well, first of all, there's stuff is assembly line. God only knows what's in it. And it's frozen first of all. Maybe loaded with preserved. And then they fry it. Okay. At least some of the places they fry it in a kids' real dripping with grease and Lard. And oh, fat, as they say. But a Tragut, they grill everything for you. Okay. They grill it on the grill. Traburo. And that's why it is fanned. I love that. I love that. Boy, that was weird. There were so many of those promos during the Cub's games. God, Almighty. Don, not, it's like I think Don, not so's going to put on a Cub uniform pretty soon because he's under just constantly. Okay. Are we taking calls? I'm a live-lost track of what we're doing. Here's a collect call from Pittsburgh. Hey, Neil, it's Larry. How you doing? Pretty good, Larry. How about that game last night? How about it, not bad, huh? Yeah, I was sitting in the sheet in centerfield. Yeah. But this town is great. No blue hairs, living and breeding people. Those pirate telecasts, he had didn't carry the game last night, so I had to watch the pirate telecasts with so boring, I almost went to sleep. I could have watched it on a nighting with Katie K.A. added up here. What? Why didn't you pick that up? The game. Because Katie K is not on the satellite. Oh, you mean, you mean television? Yeah. It's not on the satellite. Yeah. Katie K couldn't have carried it because they're never two telecasts. They must carry some of the games. Well, a third inning was great, and then they, uh, Ninth inning. Fire just choked in the night. Yeah. It was great. I saw it. Vance Losingled into I saw it. I was great. Well, I'm going to get gone. It's going to give the call to Pittsburgh. Hey, hi. Great. Well, I'm glad they did it for you, Larry. Thanks. Okay. Have a good time. Okay. See that was short and swine. It was a dangerous. 1053. Let's just move forward. Not backwards. We have open lines in Boca and Palm Beach. Only on those Palm Beach lines. Here's a facts. I'm up here in Orlando. You're right about cool. Listen to the six in a row. They played when I grew up by the beach boys. If you want to be happy by Jimmy Soul, hand-jied by Johnny Otis. Mm-hmm. Ooh, baby by Smokey and Emericals. I like that. Silly West by the rays. Please, please, by James Brown. I'm up in a James Brown. I'm sorry. I am. You're in a James Brown? I love James. I grew up with James Brown. I saw him. Yeah. I'm like in the same neighborhood. No, but I've seen a show. I wonder what we ever did with those. Are they still in here? James Brown. James Brown is still in here? Yeah, I think of... I can't find a damn thing in this rack. Oh, it's a good thing I'm going on vacation, so you can put them all in order again. That's twice. And as your Rogers coming in here to find them, that's no fun. Oh, here it is. Out the bell. No wonder he's on the other side. Oh, yeah. Right after my Anthony, that's what... Yeah. Yeah. No wonder. And then if you know like that, there's always... I'm here. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. Thanks, I'll ride you. 1054, a WIOD. Here's another cubs call from Tamara. Hello. No, okay. Uh... In that... I'm attracted to the thing which still... Anyway, uh... In 1997... Me, too, the ball. We have really gone from one end of the spectrum to the other real. We have to be with the crowd... ...the height of Bill Calls. Find me something that's in crack to the jack. To the jack. I don't care if I ever get back at these fools. Route route for the cub. These courts. Uh... If they don't win, it's a shame. Yeah, I know you were... For it's one. Them for Pittsburgh. These calls are a shame. I know you were a big fan with Pittsburgh back in 1997. From Bill's that Paul's there. If he's seven, though, I started a pirate's fan to fight. It was one for you. Remember your Harvey had a piece of the perfect game in law now we've gone to. Okay, well... And June 14th, June 14th. And night's the 27th of the time. That's the perfect... That's perfect. They haven't... I can't believe it. Turn his mic off. Go ahead, sir. From June 14th, June 16th, 16th, 177. The club did something this week. This weekend. They swept the series and that's right. They hadn't done it in 30, 30, two years in Forbes field. They did it last time, right? That's right. Well, I'm looking at the Fort Worth, they'll sunset. And the good news is there are six and all against the pirates this year. We got three at the beginning and next week in Chicago against the pirates. Well, it's also the Chicago's longest road wing streak. It says 1979, according to the paper here. We're doing it. All those Metz fans are strangely silent now. I was going to be after the All-Stab break. Oh, it's going to be after August. Oh, it's going to be after September. Well, do you want to hear the plot, too, of Mitch Welp, the highlights of Mitch Welp's career? No. No. I didn't think so. Anyway, I just wanted to get that in there. It's Webster is doing it, by the way. He's sitting about three, 15 since he came back off of the table. It's always like Mitch Welp's, Mitch Welp's. Oh, one more thing about Mitch Welp's, I'm sure you want to hear. He has 13 triples in 1986. We don't want to hear it. That's just a comma. Not even I'm getting a term with this. Okay. And he'll hear him fused. It's great. We're doing it. Mark Grace comes back then. When you're going to be happy. What? It's a possible when you're on vacation. That, uh, to open up your show when you're on vacation. You can have that, that song call, uh, with the one about Mickey Mannell talk spaceball. Oh, I hate that record. Well, I don't care. Well, I don't care. That's up to the bird. If he wants to play with a shirt he wants. Oh, I see because he just told me he's going to play it. What? Have a great day, sir. Guys, orchestrating the whole show. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but you're just obsessed. I don't like that record. You know, the only he's talking about that cornball, uh, Willie and the, um, Mc, or what? Oh, that's a, Mike Spendell used to play that all the time. I hate that record. It's so ponderous. Miramar. Miramar. Oh, hello. Yeah. Okay. I got a question about, uh, cool. No, Linda. Yeah. Well, you don't say that, uh, why do I? I think that's cool for that bird and the M.S.J. That's correct. Yeah, but, uh, I really think they should give a little bit credit for the M.S.J. That's pretty good. And it's pretty good. And they got big ratings. They're doing very well, but they could be a lot better. They play a lot of, I'll give you an example last night. I went to the store. It was kind of, it was after the game. And I turned it on and they're playing up up in a way by the fifth dimension. Oh, seriously. I don't want, the up up at a way should be on love 94, not on magic. Yeah, no, no, no, no, no. Do you agree? Yeah. What are you doing? We're not talking about baseball. We're talking about music. That's over. Oh, I didn't know that. I don't want to hear up up in a way by the fifth dimension on magic. Okay. And then they played some other, uh, real therapy. I, uh, Bobby Vitton stuff. I mean, it could be really great and they're good, but they're not great. Cool is better. Yeah. I'm sorry, the nerve thing. I got real pilot that I type. Kable thing. I don't get the WTN anymore. This is not what I mean. Well, neither does anybody else. Right. Neither does anybody else unless you got a satellite dish. I mean, there are a few people I get about too many. I call your cable company and tell me, I hate their guts. Yeah. They have to be in table for this. Yeah, it sucks is what it is. Another Ted Turner abortion. Well, listen, when the Supreme, if the Supreme Court, which I hope they don't, but if they do ban abortion, then a lot of Ted Turner stuff's going off the air. Okay. Okay. So just hope for that to happen. I see a bit. I shouldn't have said that because I don't, that's some horrendous. But again, you know, we're burning flags and stuff. This Supreme Court. I think they all ought to be fried in oil. Don't you? Boyle. We ought to get out the Bundy thing and play it next to our, just for the hell of it because everybody's all up in our eyes. All up in our eyes. All the flags. All you mindless idiots with your stupid symbolism. We can't even relate to reality. All you know is a bunch of stupid symbols. Cleaning to this Neanderthal dark age mentality. With all your primitive religions and superstitions. We'll look at that. It's past 59. We better not. Anyway, we got the Gail Bride with the 11 o'clock news. Gail of course is always bubbly and cheerful. It makes up a lot of stuff, but it's a good newscast. And then we'll come back at 11 o'clock. Steve today, baby selling part two for those, I don't understand it. Now we got Hank on Sports Talk tonight is going to give you tips on plunging at the dog track. And Yankee Baseball at Kansas City followed by followed by. I'm going to have good. Well, that's all I have to find. On New Stock Radio 610 W. I. O. D. Well, that Gail is just bubbling today. Isn't she? She's just effervescent every day. Bumbling like ginger ale. Mm-hmm. You ever thought of it in those terms before? Never. Well, anyway. We got our flag flying this morning out in front of the complex. You and Kills City. Oh, they're going to run it up the flagpole. Uh-huh. Yeah, that's what happened. They were going to do pirate radio, but they changed your mind because they ran the idea up the flagpole with Tim Williams. And the both came tumbling down to the ground. Right on Rick Edwards head too. Gosh. But you know what they say where there's no sense. There's no feeling. Hey, what the hell are you? Oh, one, two, three. Time. Hell, we haven't enough for today already. We thought, yeah, I can't believe he's got off his mic, Nick. I need to be a check back. Good night. I don't care if I ever get back to a huge group. Rick Edwards for the call. Be it playing the limits of shame. Four and one, two, three. Three strikes were louder. The old one. Yeah. Okay, 1107 at WIDD. You're right. We've had too much of that by far. Anyway, let's go to this Batman Spirey board. Hello. Hey, Neil, how you doing? Okay. Jason. Yeah. From that other movie, huh? Yeah, whatever. I went to one of the Nick preview events showing the Batman last night. And there was just this one line I thought I would let you in on. One point where the Joker is really ticked and he's just heard about the Batman everything. And Nick will send, I know you're not a big nickel fan. Now. But in his eloquent way, he turns to one of his henchmen next to him and says, setting the whole town for the movie says, this town needs an animal. Really? And the whole body and sister are up to it. And I don't know about anybody else there, but there was this one entire party in the road behind me. They must have all the Neilies because they all turn each other and sort of look at each other and say, yeah, we can relate to that. And there was a little bit of a, well, if he would have said, I'm dying over here. I bet that would have done it. Maybe he did say that somewhere along the way. Probably. We just didn't catch it. I don't like him. I'm sorry. I know it. It's definitely in delight Jack Nicholson, but he was great in Cook Who's Nasty. He was tremendous. There was one of the great movies of all time, but other than that, he makes me pewped. You never saw, um, I was the same. He's playing the same. No. Never saw witches of these. Yeah, I saw a little bit of that. I couldn't watch it was horrible. What about you? What was that was sharing that? Yeah, horrible. Tried it down. Yeah. And Crow, he was not. I don't like it. I don't like him. I don't like him. I don't like him. Well, I'm almost out of material. I just want to say Jeff, uh, if he's out there listening. Lock it in. Okay. See you. There are a lot of people in this audience who ought to be locked in. Anyway, we have it opening in Browd one in Palm Beach. If you move very fast, because I have a feeling today is going to be just, uh, like Greece and up the old ducks bill. It's 11 or not, whatever that means. I don't know what that means, but it sure sounds pretty exciting. Never think doing any Griffith show. And so like watching that he tech does, that's what the promo says over and over. They got done nuts and he's snooping around and making a general ass. Don nuts. See again, this is another one of those things where, and that show is from when. 20 years ago, 60s, early 60s ago, 20 some years ago. But done nuts was, that was not his claim to fame. Done nuts was great on a Steve Allen show. And Tom Poston was great on a Steve Allen show. I thought it was they were locked in the astronaut that did it for done nuts. Yeah. That's the one. I want to put them over the top with Sylvestre Stallone. Nine minutes past, uh, whatever hour it is. I could confuse to the hour. So I'm just going to start saying it's nine past the hour. My amy. Hello. Did I do two lines there? One second there. Yeah. Uh, my own. Yes sir. Oh, and your home. Great. Are you going to invocation next week? Right. So I'm going to be Rochester. Great. Yeah. I should have about thirty white hats for me. Uh, yeah. Something I was going to bring up. I got a friend down here on South Africa. He highway. He's got a piece of place. And I've been talking to him and I told him that your show would be the perfect one to advertise to the United Kingdom to start trying them. Hmm. Song, you think it could go over. I got news for a boy. If anybody down here, I've been trying for about a year to convey the message to Charhut that they should carry him because they make stuff, you know, on the, they Terbrill stuff on the grill. Just like they do it on a bobs and it would be perfect because they're, like, like half the city of Rochester lives down here now. But then, nobody seems to be interested in doing it. All I'd have to do is have a ship frozen from up there. It's not a plane 500 pounds or whatever. Yeah. Oh, absolutely. Talking to him about he's interested and I said your show is, uh, it's a one and only for advertising it on. No question about it. He says bring me down some of the product I'll try it out and see what I think. Okay. What if he does it? Let me know. Yeah. I always thought when you were talking about down in bobs up there, you're talking about the one is C.B. No. I've never been to that one. I mean, well, in fact, that's the one to go to now because the one I'm under O' Avenue has been sold at the guy who owns all those windies and he's changed it all around. The last time I was there last summer was pretty, uh, it wasn't bad, but wasn't like it used to be. Started messing, you know, when you mess with success, like they do in this business, when you mess with success, your bound to slip. Yeah, they get it right and they get more and then they got a record try to save a couple of one. Well, but he bought it out from the original guy and he figured he'd do a better than they did. There's nobody could do a better than they did. There's a phone in this guy shop. I think about the pizza place that came for Rochester few years ago and he said that down in Bought to see Breeze, these to be a road along there. What was that? Make sure Boulevard. I don't know. I, uh, that's not my part of town at all. No, I said they tore all that up. Now they're now round to play Bay. Let's pick boats and you've got to take the skyway here. What was it called? That bridge? They built 104. This skyway? Well, I don't know that part of the city at all. Let's grow a Greek to me as they say in Greece. Now, root 104 into Webster. Okay. Is that named after Mitch Webster? Uh, beats me? Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, have a great time. We're going to call from up there, right? Uh, sure. Yeah. You won't be there. Well, is that so what's wrong with that? Is this guy chop liver over here? Or the blade will be there. He'll be here. He may not accept the call, but he'll be here. He doesn't like Rochester. Tell him you're calling from Lakeland. He says the case. Okay. Have a good time. All right. Bye. Call him and it's after 11 at WIOD and... I want to remind you get about the great Yo Frank right tree. I'll tell him. I have no transaction required. Yeah. You have to hold on a second. Well, we're trying to find something. We don't have any cue sheets. That's not it. Listen, fun. And then go through all these different things. I'm trying to find a one-stink cut. Well, I see. I think it's worth it. I love this. Oh, yeah. It's a great cut, but it's, um, Pondrous. Yeah. Pondrous is definitely the word. Okay. In fact, if you look up Pondrous in the dictionary, you'll find a picture of what we're doing right now. That's not it. Oh, Jayce. This is embarrassing, isn't it? But it's so typical of WIOD. And so just textbook of everything that we do here. Not slow, not fast. Just got a half fast. Hey, guess what? It might be. It could be. It is. Well, hi. It's doing boys and girls. This is Uncle Jack Nicholson for the Rock and Roll Report. I'm so damn pissed off at everything these days. Can I say pissed? I'm rock and roll radio. You better believe I can. Because I'm one busy dude right now. I don't have time to do it over again. Anyway, I'd like you to hear my story. The three bears. The mama bear, the daddy bear, and the baby bear who really pissed me off. Well, forget about it. That's all I got to say. Yeah, 27 after a life in a great thing too. And I went through that. I'm going to start when I come back from vacation. I'm going to put little things. Things. Like a little thing on the outside of each show. Plastic case with some of the highlights in each one. So I know what the hell is in there. I know that sounds probably pretty rare for me. So I thought this would fit right in with all the hysteria about the flag and the plastic Jesus and the Zazan the door. All these silly symbols that America's in team. You can do a real good thing. Hi ladies and gentlemen. I'm ready to broadcast. I love myself. There is nothing. Oh boy. He is on it today, isn't he? And if he ever gets off it, he's going to be dangerous. Okay, it's 1128 at WIOD. Here's a mobile and broward. Hello. Hey Neil, how are you doing? Great. Good. Listen, this is the first time I've called, but I've been listening to you for about three months. So when did you leave New York, sir? I'm not from New York, Philadelphia. Wow, same difference. But I got to tell you some question. What's the major ever on WCA? You and Philadelphia? No, he was on WWD B for a year. I'm from New York. 96.5 on HFM dial. Oh, is that where they are? Yeah. Well, I'll be damned. How do you like that? Hey, listen. I got to thank you. I've heard. I never went to the track in my life. But every time I hear you guys discussing this stuff, I said, you know what? I got to go. So I went to go. I got to go. I got to go. I see. A lot of people have that effect from this show. Anyhow, I just want you guys to know that I went to colder. Yeah. And I don't know anything about the jockies like you guys. A little more. I just picked numbers. There you go. That's a way to do it. I went 6 for 6. Great. 6 for 6. You believe this guy? 6. Well, they said it was beginners luck. I went to the window after the third time they had these guys. It must sit there and watch. People started coming over to me and asking me who I liked. So I made a deal with the guy. I said if I give you the winning number, you give me 10%. So I had three guys that I gave three races to and they gave me about 120 to the hour. Yeah. That's great. Of course, it's also illegal. We're tracing the call as the speed defense. That's okay. I'm going to mobile. Let them find them. All right. No problem. I feel like I know you're in the air. I can't wait to get in and listen to you guys and just keep up the good work. Thank you. And don't catch too many. They'll take you away. Okay. Thank you. Bye. Well, that's terrific. That's almost as exciting as the Epipsy guy. Man he coming in and bringing us to your diet bark. So the D.A.R.Q. Yeah. But no caffeine at either. Why it is just great. I'm not even drinking it yet because it's not cold yet. But it's, uh, I can taste it already. The best diet soda ever made. Ever. Ever. If you don't like root beer, of course, then you got a problem. Well, I grew up here. Good. I'm happy for you. It's 11.30 a W.O.D. West Palm Beach, hello. Oh. Yeah. Okay. I'm going to find it. The final. I'm going to advertise you to see what having Rick, Rick, and Tiki is living a free lunch. Oh, that's a good. And, uh, that great talk up. Yeah. Are you, uh, I'm going to have a couple of stuff. I'll be right on tape so if you can talk up on lunch. Ha ha ha. He's bringing you lunch. Well, he's bringing me a while. He's talking up on lunch. I can be by time on there. Oh. Oh, he's really coming by. I thought this was a joke. Yeah. No. He's really coming by. Well, actually what they're going to do. They're going to cook lunch on his head. He's taking a camp off. He's got like a grill. Like a grill underneath that camp. Rickies grill. Yeah. Rick's. Rickies grill. Yeah. I'm not sure if he would underneath the hat. I hear a rumor. It's like the Grand Canyon. I'd like to begin these space. Yeah. Empty space. Um. The day will never see. That's why I'm moving. My material is running off. Wait a minute. What is that? Where did that go? Is that for us? You're welcome. Thank you. Well, thank you so much for malaria. I've got a fantastic pride. I brought us some grapes and some plums and peaches. Well, that's nice. That's exactly what I need. Instead of all this delicious fattening food. Some delicious fruit. How do you like that, sir? Did you hear Bill Coller's call? I hear his call. He's talking to you, Landa. This is a. Wait a minute. Larry's the guy who keeps calling on the thing. Is that the one? Oh, he always like Larry. We'll just take the phone off the hook. Well, listen, have a great day. Well, I got a very important celebrity call coming up. Okay. I was just wondering if I'd never seen a picture of the bird. I mean, I'm in Michigan together. Right. We'll be giving those away tomorrow to it. Thank you, Landa. I'll tell you the Hollywood. Okay. An important call here on the bat line from a real connoisseur of the equine breed. How are you, Neil? Great. I feel. It's Bill Saltel. Ladies and gentlemen, the voice of Carter. Listen, I was starting to panic because you hadn't mentioned call during the picking horses. And I was so glad to hear you made a couple of excellent selections today, by the way. Did we really? Yes, I really. I personally like both your picks today. I've been mine. I got to be honest with you. I'm getting, I don't, something's, I'm not trying to look for a scapegoat here, but something's happened to the great of entries in both newspapers. And when you're just picking names, you like to have somebody's got a shot, you know? Well, you certainly have two horses that have a big shot today. Great. As a matter of fact, I wanted to ask a bird. Why are you coming to the track for any particular reasons? I know what you want to lose his money. What's going on? Why is he coming? His brother is going and he wants to go with him and help him lose his money. Oh, fantastic. Listen, why don't you guys come up to the show? Okay. And we'll give you a quick tour of what the hell goes on and how nobody knows anything. They're not going to come up there, but they'll, it sounds good. Now it might happen, too. Well, I'll tell you this. If you come up early, you know, like as soon as you get to the track, see if I can't let you know at least what anybody else knows up there. Maybe we can help you win a couple of bucks. Great. Yeah. I'll be out about three o'clock, too. That'll be great. Come on up and whatever's left on the card, but let you know what we know. Which isn't really much. By the way, Hank said things have been going so bad for him up there. He's taking an extra set of clothes on next time. I'll go up, okay. Yeah, well, usually when call the first starts the first few weeks, you know, or coming from other tracks, going to stuff what you need to give him a little time to kind of settle in before the form for the prize. You know, and no one's really having a great meeting yet, but the call does a great place once they start settling in and everyone's got form to count on. Yeah. Anyway, I'll be looking forward to seeing both of you. And I'll also be looking forward to having you pick a horse for the first time. I want to ask you a question since you know everything. Yeah, right. Why? Pizzoui, I see was in the last race again. A one easy yesterday, Rex on edge for eight, 60. And he seems to be a lot of days in the last race. And no other mounts. Why is he here? He knows that's funny. You said you should mention that. Pizzoui wasn't even supposed to ride that horse. The regular rider, whoever it was, was took off. Yeah. At the last minute, I think it was Gaple's young, but I'm not sure. Really? And Pizzoui was stilled in form and just got lucky and found the live mount. And he rode the horse perfectly. Oh, yeah. He's a hell of a guy. Why is he here though? He was doing okay in New York. Well, actually he wasn't doing as well as he thought he would be doing in New York. And that's the reason that he came back. You know, it's better to be a big fish and a big pond. Yeah. Yeah. And that's probably the reason why he came back. Well, he came back. He came back to his right. So he was a benefit from it. You bet he's, uh, he's terrific. Yeah. Okay. Well, let's say that one of the things before I go. So the 976 race number, you know, now is national, Neil. I don't know if you know this, but you can get, if you will, let's say, like the horse and any part of the country, you can dial that 976 race and hear any result in the United States. Great. You know, so that's a tremendous thing. I know for you, occasionally, you'll hear something out of town or something and you might want to just find that what's going on. Of course. In my case, I might actually see it on a satellite. Well, that's true. If it's a, well, look, I, we also cover Yakimo, Meadows and Washington. So if you can get that on satellite, man, let me know. Now, that's about the only one I can't. I get, yeah, you'd be amazed. I get to fill it off of your park and suffoc downs and I would have had to toggle and bail on a close. This probably five or six shows that you can watch about, I would say seven array. We get West Coast from the, a prime ticket out of California. Bell Montefat go on. That's where you're late.

Are you working into Joe who's on vacation now? No, Joe knows that baseball. I just think it'd be a great combination. I mean, it would just... Joe knows his sports. Okay. My maybe boring his health.

Huh. Ron. Let's go to a coral spring, hello. Hmm. Is this a heavy breather mouth breather or a no breather? Hello. Hello. Yeah. This is Papa No sir. Oh, excuse me. Okay. Well, it said, was it my mistake because he's got too awesome. There were two coral springs. Well, I was in old call to who died. How you doing anyway, Neil? We're doing anyway. Okay. Papa No. Great. This is a hands-wagon there. I'm from Rochester. I've been down here about 18 years. And you know, I've been listening to you for a long long time. And I've never called because it's been so busy. You're the phones been busy for all those years, yeah? Yeah. Well, I'll lose your, but anyways, the queen is going to write us in next week. What? My wife is going to write us in the queen? The queen? The queen I call her to queen. Oh. I'll show her a lot of company, I think. Anyway, a lot of queens and writers too soon. Listen to this. I understand that they got rid of the cannon worms up there. They did? Yes. Yes. Somebody ate it. No, I heard they weeded it all. Yeah. They weeded it all. Yeah. They weeded it the expressways. No, Kenny. They didn't get rid of it. They just weeded it. They weeded it. Then they weeded it all. It's a little tiny city. There's no problem driving around there. Anybody complaints about driving a Rochester after driving here is going to be nuts. Okay. Any, they did have a 10 year old kid could drive up there. Anyway, I just wanted to say a law on. I think we live in the same complex. You still live at Lakeview courts? No. No, I'm in Jack Arandon. Now I moved up in the world. Oh, you did. Oh, yeah. I'm with all those wealthy people. Yeah, yeah. Wonderful. What I'm with them. Hey, Carrie, okay. You too. Nice trip. Okay. Thanks. Some 44. Now, what's he was a nice guy? He didn't know where he was. He's gone by the reason I skydive. Do I remember the Wilton North report that's the show Steve did? No, I don't. I don't know. You did. I heard the name. Yeah. Was a short-lived box disaster. No, no, no, no, we're eating his fruit. I had a pizza plum in about three grapes, so don't go getting his steric alapse. That's his fruit. Although if I keep eating the fruit, it's only a quarter to twelve. I may have a little bit of an interruption in the show. That's fine. The grapes are good. Yeah. And of course, if you eat enough of those grapes, you're going to be making a mad dash to check the name. 1145, a W.I.O.D. here's a call from our favorite city, Cooper City. Neil watch out. You better not eat too much of that fruit. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, I've got a spy report for any of this. This is Jack. Yeah, you have to do this. I think I'll send in those damn pigs. Piss me on. That's the cart goes, right? Yep. Anyway, any home? I'm making a pubic service report for anybody who traveled me over, for giving him the O-Craft Look, but he used the S word. And I tried to find out what that was. And he couldn't define it for me. So he said I was going between 20 and 25 and at 30s. So how fast do you suppose to go? Three. Yeah, that's what he told. Right on the button. I said, you know, the 29 you've had it. There's got to be a happy medium between zero and 30. I thought. Well, it used to be a happy medium, but she's in jail now. She is. Yeah. Somebody was walking on her lawn with him. Yeah. And he sprayed them. Yeah. I love this guy's voice. But anyway, so then he wanted to know if we had any drugs or guns in the car. I said, no, but you're welcome to search it. So he decided, well, of course I am. He says, you can bet I will. So he searched the car. He hoped open the door. And I've got like a dent in front of my door and the door hits the fender. So then he asked, are you planning on getting a car soon? Can you believe that? Well, maybe he sells them on the side. Yeah, that's how he moves lights. Drugs are cars. Both. Yeah. Okay. You have a great day now. Okay. You know those pigs really pissed me off. Okay. Good luck to you. That's Jack Jr. Hi. You're doing boys and girls. This is Uncle Jack Nicholson for the Rock and Roll Report. I'm so damn pissed off at everything these days. Can I say pissed? I'm rock and roll radio. You better believe I can because I'm one busy dude right now. And I'll have time to do it over again. Anyway, I'd like you to hear my story. The three bears, the mama bear, the daddy bear, and the baby bear who really pissed me off. Well, forget about it. That's all I got to say. Can you see the terms of entertainment? No. He was... I don't think like Jack Nicholson. I mean, is this some kind of a law that I have to like him? I can't say like you've seen any. I can't. Look, if there are people that you know like do watch movies with them? Like sliced alone. He makes me puke. Okay. So if he's in a movie, am I going to watch it? No. And he was... He was great in kukus nest. He was tremendous. And also in terms of entertainment. He had one. There we go. He's like doing up here. He's like he's psychotic. I disagree. Have you ever... Well, yeah, you probably see him at the Lakers games. Perfect. And broadcast news at the anchor. He's sitting on the sidelines at the Lakers games. And he's just a psychotic bearer. He isn't his movies. He doesn't have to act. That's him. It's like 48. Okay. I'm glad you like him. Everybody likes him. I'm in a minority again. I'm not on the limb, but I'm used to that. Okay. I don't care. I don't like him. I don't think you're giving him. I don't dislike him personally. In other words, if I see him on the show. What? I don't like any of the movie. Like the shining was idiotic. It was horrendous. It was one of the worst movies of all time. He's always doing this. I've affected. And he's always got that same psychotic look. And his cheeks are, you know, look like they're about to explode. He's just a silly guy. I don't like him. Okay. Do I have to like Jack Nicholson? No, you don't have to. First, we got to have a big sentence about the flag. Now we're going to have a big thing about Jack Nicholson because he's playing the Joker in Batman, right? And I got news for you. Caesar Romero was better as the Joker. And I haven't even seen a movie yet. Yeah. Caesar Romero was a definitive Batman. I'm the Joker. Okay. Okay. He was. Just like just like all these Sherlock Holmes movies they try to make. Okay. Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce were Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson. All these other people that doesn't make it. Okay. It doesn't cut it. All right. Do you know what I'm saying? Okay. It's like, Bill on the Go See was Dracula. When you see all these other Franklin, Jell-on, all these people try to be Dracula. Goes over like a pregnant pole vaulter in the middle of August in Rome. Okay. But I'm not talking about Batman. I haven't seen Batman. I'm talking about Jack Nicholson. And his Oscar level. Is he a pain where I sit? How many of you are tall in the same? He's the same. I don't agree. He's a one-note Charlie. I don't agree. A sucks. It's everybody. Can't stand Jack Nicholson at second tired of that routine. He's calling him immediately. Look at that. Every line is lit on the board. I hadn't even finished the sentence. It's 10. Hmm. If you like him, go see it 10 times. I don't get stuck in a heavy influence on my life one way or the other. Okay. In addition to which nobody can play robin like Bert Ward. All rising movies for the rest. We bird out Jack Nicholson. So we're going to argue about that. Go about. Can't have some pseudo-electual like Bill Cospered here. But of course he can't come on and show. No, say from me so I said, oh, that's right. Okay. We have. Look at the board all of a sudden. Boy, what the hell did we do? All right. Well, it must have been that Jack Nicholson. Okay. We lost three calls. It's almost unprecedented, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Hang up on all of them, which I'm about ready to do. Open line and Broward 524Wildy, of course, Palm Beach, which we don't, hey, we don't really care. I hate to burst your bubble, but we, you know, if you call fine, and if not life goes on, that's the impact Palm Beach has in my life. The bulk of puker. It says. Is he gone? Well, he's got a lot of nerve. Okay. We put him right at the head of the list and he hangs up. What a munghead. She says that makes me want to puker. Makes me want to walk him out. Miami. Hello. Yeah. You can do your, it was up, Neil. Okay. He must have caught it from the other guy that was on hold. Yes. Listen, I called up your buddy, Gondweter, Zeta, and they're not playing D. Not in D. Not. No. See that woman. That woman. The her ever not seen their toh C. Aaron, or husbandseed this is one of the things. People don't even know what they're listening to. Half the time well Finished, especially on music stations. They don't know what station they got on. The hero Record all year. I heard it on Zeta but if she did hear it then it must be on she. Somebody said the other day she's not playing it. You gotta be selling shoes at JCPenney's or something. You better. Okay, I get you good to do this. There isn't the other thing you've been talking about that barge, you're beer. Barge is a barge. I thought that barge would be a great stuff. I found it by the month ago and the best diet. Yeah, the best diet, so to mean the regular, I bought by accident the other day. Like I said, it's okay, but the diet is just orgasmic. It's just even better than the regular. Oh yeah. But the thing is, the technique, they stop selling our hires over now. They stopped selling that. Didn't they used to make hires and Rochester, I think? I don't know if it's stopped selling that. They replaced with bark. I would hate, you know, I hate to be subsidizing a product that is competing with something they make it rockers. But you know, because I buy a lot of code act film. I'll say that. I want all those people from Rochester know that I'm, you know, I don't buy any hickie-freeman suits, but I do buy a lot of code act film. And this is Neil, so you can get the casinos on some time next week. Wow. Then you can tell if you can tell if you can buy. You can play that just before I leave for vacation. That'll be great. Okay. I want more things. I thought, sweetie, driving your clothes out of the garbage here the day. Yeah. Yeah. With the Phoebe Kates on the truck. How a great day. I heard about that through the grapevine. Yeah. Oh, speaking of Gerber's, did I tell you? I mentioned that to you that idiot called again on my answering machine. Amazing. So, it obviously is somebody who knows someone at W. Carol City, because he had my number over at Lakeview Courts. And now he's got my new number in its story. You might got it. How can that happen? No. Couldn't have. Highly unlikely. So, it's somebody from connected with over there, which, by the way, reminds me if I get any more calls from that particular person. I have incredible stories, which I am willing to tell on the year about a certain somebody. Someone who used to, I told a story about the board-up member of those days and he wasn't putting my calls to a caterer. I don't want to mention his name on the air again, but just to give the audience a little hint, I've got some incredible kick-and-ass with 50,000 watts of power all over South Florida. From the keys to the palm beaches, even out to the Bahamas. This is W.I.N. because I think this Gerber's taught this a high-end. Yeah, I think so. Shock. Anyway, to live in 57, somebody just expired dead in day one with that card on it. They just hit up like our, New Orleans. Yeah, hello. Hello. How long have you been here on your hand? It barks, Beerus from New Orleans. That your ass is up to the assumption. That should I. We're talking about barks root, root, root, peer. That's right. That's right. Is from New Orleans? I'm New Orleans. Wait a minute. Let me look on the can of Betty's right. I don't think so. I think this is like for Massachusetts. If they're originated here. Did it? Wait a minute. Look at this. Bologacy Mississippi. I'm serious. That's what it says. It's been bottled there. Bologacy Mississippi. Yeah. This was bottled. It was canned in Bologacy. Huh. I know some people in the business got canned in Bologacy. I think Bill Colder. Right. You're in New Orleans. I've got my mother and daily covered up. Because you know, you know what is right here. Yeah. A lot of goyum there. Yeah. I went to his, uh, his bio-assmaid. He's a man who's something called K-H-N-B-R. K-H-N flavored beer. He's right. And just it said, don't even try it. It's the worst thing in the world. That's really interesting. That's isn't it. It is. It's well. I mean, it's interesting information. It's like, yeah. He's like, uh, it's like, you're going into rest of it. They say, don't eat the food here. It will make you sick. Right. Anyway, if they say, how's by you? Don't think they're friendly. Okay. What was the name of that movie Southern comfort? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Just keep that in mind. I'm getting real nervous. I'd go out and buy some rosary beads right away. It starts fondling them. Okay. And that's all you should be fondling. Well, I'm just chewing on cookies right now. Okay. There he's on here. I got tired of it. In 20 seconds. I'm moving. I'm moving out of my hand. Really? You're a woman. And a million dried. But why don't you know that? And once in my cell, give you a cough in the air for the new one. We need to report. Great. Okay. Well, make like a regular feature out of it. Okay. Have a great life. See ya. Right. Okay. We got April War them. I guess standing by right. I see I forget. We're doing W to the audience remember. Boy, a lot of those guys are standing up to salute the flag right. But the guys called. I know. Be great. Yeah. And I opened one just now that was warm. Couldn't wait. Well, my diet's Pepsi's like a delivery. Isn't that interesting too? Thank God I was drinking diet. Yeah. He came in because it could have been a diet co-cramada machine. I hate to say it. I won't say it. Because that'll be another argument. About whether you like Pepsi or Coke better. Is. And you really think I'm going to. I don't give up then. Hey, listen, it wouldn't be the first time. And then Mike Miller will call in. We'll have to take a poll. Follow six of WIOD and boy. This is zipping along pretty damn good here today. Baby selling part two on a cane show. Hank plunge your brains out. Goldberg on sports talk. And I think he based fall in eight with Kansas City. Kanger City. And Larry King afterward at 11 o'clock. With some of those really unpredictable calls. That little advice to that show. It's about time. Guys, may I check? How the book of Puker is back, we hope. Yes, I'm here. You shine this. That was a meeting of one of those Inmateers that are. Oh, it's easy to get a wife. A few more of those. Puker, Rimmitators, straight up all over the town. You bet. That's when state of Little Girl named me called you. Yep. That was my daughter. Really? Yeah. Bigger's. Maybe we'll be seeing tomorrow at Hollywood. Great. I'm trying to talk to you. Sounds more like a threat than a promise of you asked me. I won't leave you in the air. Any of your foods or nothing will happen. Okay. Okay. Deal, later. Bye. Why did I put him on hold? I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just lost. 1207, I do what I did. We've got our picture. It's early today. So I've been kind of anxious to get out of here. Talk to Bill Coller. We talked to Bill Saltman. What did that mean? Incredible. Thank Goldberg. Jack Nicholson, tune you. Jack, tune you. It's been good, really. Funny. A book a puker before? What we've had it all today. It's only a little afternoon. Okay. We do have some open lines on that board. What had browned? What had a book? What had Palm Beach? Kind of like a nice symmetrical thing right there on the board. Please, tantam in the seventh race. That's my pick. Oriental game in the eighth with Gonzalez. That's some yours. I still said excellent picks. Yeah. That's okay. Well, it's about time that we picked something and had a chance. How did you look at the, uh, the little scoreboard? Look at that Oriental game is, uh, Slater is best bet of the day. Almost everybody picks it. I didn't look at that either. Lee tantam, um, castle cannon is just about everybody's pick. Lee tantam is picked second third third third in the consensus. That's okay. That's a good boxer. I don't want that chalk. Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Neil. Yeah. This is Johnny Stardust. Oh, my god. I think we got a bad connection. Neil. I think we got a bad connection, John. Neil, I just want to tell you I'm going to see it Hollywood tomorrow. Oh, boy. And I'm bringing Jughead and Bob and Tim. Mm-hmm. All right. And I got gifts for both of you guys. Do you know, first. How you doing? Jughead's going to be there. Yep. Juggy. You've got a really good incredible. Yeah. I did shocking. All right. Well, I give anything to the puck. I was fine. I corrected. I'm looking for a whole lot on life. Hold on, Johnny. Okay. Boy now this. We got to do a set up here in a second. Okay. You know that all this show is. I'm doing anything. So he's kicking sandwich is nothing but the best virgin white chicken breast man that they cook on a grill for you while you watch the best. So get away. You know, if you want to be one of the, one of the rodents out there. You know, one of the ants that are following each other around. You can continue going to those fast food junk food places and eating the slot that they put out. You know, an old little sacks. But the bottom line is if you want a great lunch or dinner snack and inexpensive, quick, then char-hut is the intelligent choice. Okay. And coming the first to July, believe it or not, whether you like it or not, the official Neal Rogers char-hut refillable squeeze bottle for you to squeeze funnel and have a great time with. Okay. Sunrise, Tamaract, Davy, Hollywood, Miami, Oakland Park and of course you'll find the newest char-hut in Margate. I am speechless. I am speechless. I need to tell one. Well, I was incredible. Wasn't it? I was so shocked. Okay, we have an open line in Palm Beach. Look at that. I'm even burning the copybook with my spring cigar. By the way, if a Joe with the cigars, yeah, these are okay. I'm not too mad. You ever saw the cigars that made your smokes. They are. But they start just barnburn. There's a Gary's. You know, and wouldn't you think by now he would learn. He's a man. Oh, my. What a lie. What a lie. Mobile. Yeah. What he just keeps popping away man. I can't smoke one of them. He must go through a half a dozen a day. But here's Tony and Broward. Hello. Hey, Neil. This is Tony. Have a few and once. In where? Prince. Well, like I said, in Broward, didn't Virginia. Hey, I'm sorry. I didn't know it wasn't supposed to mention those call letters. What's that? Uh, last time I can mention them because you dumped me last time. What call letters? Uh, you next door neighbor's call letters. On Ours, WGTR 97.3. That's over. No, see, that's over because we made a bill. No, we didn't make up. We made a deal. Spike wise said that he would take the blame for everything that goes wrong. If we continued mentioning the call letters. And I thought that was a pretty good deal. Oh, quite frankly, he's usually to blame anyways. So it's not much of a deal. Are they going to play the Dean record? No. No. Just stubborn. That's why stubborn is a mu. He knows better for everybody. And then the meantime, their numbers are okay. Did they even get the Brian Wilson album? Have we heard it? Yes. Which one? Brian Wilson, you have the beach boys. We've heard it. We played, we were the only ones playing it on Zeta back last fall. Really? Well, I don't have a lot of it. I'm a parent, Winchberg, you know. Well, that's no excuse. You're supposed to know about these things. Don't you have a good pipeline? Hey, I'm the only one in town that even knows about you guys. Oh, come on. My good friend Jerry Falwell knows. I'll about to show he loves it. He's a big fan. Yeah, he really, you probably listen to every time he's done. He just said, Jesus loves you. Jesus loves you. Hey, you know, we finally got a talk station up here. They finally decided to do one. Really? W-F-I-R and Rono. I thought for sure the call ended up there would be W-G-O-D. And they talked about Larry King and Zink Goldberg all the time. Who is Zink Goldberg? They don't come any better than Hank Goldberg. Now, here, listen, I tape my call with Falwell. Listen to this. I know that the Lord even loves Neil Rogers. How do you like that? God loves you, Neil. Yeah. Listen to your care man. I don't want to respond to him. Wait a minute. You're paying for this? Yeah. Now, don't do that. I told you, call us, collect now, Tony. Are you collecting? Please, anytime. All right. Hey, this company's got more money than God, okay? All right. Well, okay. Don't do that. Take care of yourself. Bye. Can't believe he was paying for the call. Operator, if you're listening, reverse the charges. What operator? He dialed it direct. But it sounds good, though, doesn't it? What a great con job. We want to pay for that call, okay? We'll do anything, so Tony doesn't have to pay for that call. Okay. Look at that. Everything's going just great. Palm Beach is still open, though. Oh, you are. People up there, you make me sick. There are a lot of wonderful people listening in Palm Beach County, but they just have nothing to say. I mean, most of our listeners, you hear these calls. We don't do any kind of like scientific solving the problems of the world. Show. And this Mike Seagull and Bob Grant, Jerry Williams and all of those other bags of wind. We're not like that. We just sit here and help you have a good time and kill a few hours and make you forget where you live and pretend that we're all happy, okay? So all purpose of the show. Kind of like a little relief from pain. Is that what it is? That's what it is. That's so leap for the hours. And for those who hate the show and listen, like the guy who calls back, it's kind of like an incident. Sure. You know, guys like the one who called who has the whips and chains on the walls, busy and the angels are waiting for them to stop right now. Miami up, up, up, hello. Hello. Yeah. Hey, dude. Yeah, pal. This is the original James Addiction caller. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Me and the talk to you dude. Okay, pal. You ripped them bad. I knew you would. But I didn't think you could get killed. But listen, did I play it? Did I buy the album? Yeah. Did I play it? Did I give it to Nick who enjoys it? Jack. Jack could taste it. What? What? The girl that wants to have likes it too. Yeah. No, Sharon does not like. No, she doesn't. She hates it. Nick keeps making the stories up. She says no. Nick also said that Todd loved the deal. And he was putting his finger down his throat and down his pants. It was incredible. Todd has a good taste. Oh, and about Bob Mold. It's really ironic because he used to be with a band called Who's Coulderdale. Go ahead. Called Why? Who's Coulderdale? Who? Coulderdale. Do you remember? No, I know. I know. Just that if you don't say it very carefully, it sounds like something a subrosa. Yeah. As in subrosa, folder. What? But anyway. Bob Mold. Yeah. See, I threw off guard a little bit. Yeah. That's the idea of the show. Okay. What anyway? He's in a band called Who's Coulderdale. Which is a lot like Jane D'Dick. Well, it says here, Nick who's an expert in this crappy music. He says, Who's Coulderdale is Speed Metal. No, man. Nick, Nick, Nick, you don't know anything about music. This guy in the phone, he's an expert. This is the underground metal. And the guy that's been here. I think what he means is you have to be on speed to listen to it. No, not true. It's more like noise rock. Yeah, noise rock. I like Jane's addiction. No, no. You need a good dooby. Do you enjoy that? No, no. Well, our argue with that. Can I launch it? One good dooby in that picture, right? Yeah. But our two couldn't hurt to be honest. Two couldn't hurt. Then you really get into it. And there's another thing. And three would be paradise for that album. Well, I know. Besides a Stan's cigar is made. But yeah. Listen to it. Listen to it. You guys have a newspaper. Like in Ross did you. I said, I'm smoking a newspaper. Yeah. Anyway, there's another thing. He said, Who's Coulderdale is like black flag. If you turn it up loud and up, it'll kill every insect in your house. Yeah, black flag is another good thing. Oh, I'm sure. Yeah. If you don't like the music, at least it'll kill all the insect. And then they got another new group called Rochmo Tell, which is my favorite. If you don't like the music, you just got to hang out there. Hang it up. Okay, listen. There's another band I want to turn you on to. Yes. Maybe you like this one a little bit better. Probably not, but give it a try. Probably not. Well, well, you didn't say anything about Bob Moldo. You didn't say it. No, I can't. But now it's 100 downpuff. I thought that. Yeah, but you got to be a little commercial if you're going to make some money. Okay. You can't get into this esoteric crap and make any money. I like that single. I might even play it again today. Yeah, I find what I did with it. He's got a bunch of different guys from different underground bands working with them. They took the best from all and put stuff together. Yeah. There's one new band with you. Okay. Okay. Bone sandwich. What is it? Grunt, bone sandwich. Oh, we had that last Wednesday for lunch. You didn't. You've run? Ball sandwich. What that sounds good. This man. Yeah, if you put that all together, I'm not sure sure we can talk about it on the air. How really? Do you promote local music? Sure, whatever you like. Okay. Well, they're local bands. Yeah, play drums for that. But so's Jane's addiction? Yeah, no. Well, they're from here. The singers from here. Yeah, there you go. Our players from Hylia. Well, CD on Lisa lives in Bokas so we can promote his music and beat a little bit. Oh, about the, and he does. You vocal effects. You can hear it. He has a dubler or mini verb or something. I didn't say he doesn't. But the point is when he came in here and he sat down in the chair and sang. It was great. I have for some. Huh? For some. Oh, get it. Well, look. I'm not saying you'd necessarily like his music. But I'm talking about the fact that guy is got great talent for what he does. Okay. I'm not saying you necessarily like it. But he doesn't have to enhance his voice like these other all these other idiots to sound good. Yeah. That's the extension of your stuff. Studio helps a lot. Just a little thing. Okay. Okay. Michael. Are you going to be okay now? Yeah. Okay. See you later. Prop 47. Look at the. He's just one of the nice people in his business. I don't know how he ever sneaked into the business because he just a nice guy. Hmm. And the boy that I'm not in the right place. He does some other spots too here and there. He should be doing a lot of agency stuff because he's got a tremendous voice. I don't know. You don't know Ken Maldon? Oh my god. I thought you've been it. Didn't he used to work at GBS? GBS? Oh, for a year. She was a GBS. I don't know. Probably worked with Bumble. What are the few? I think I got it. Every once in a while he'll drop me a note like that and I always appreciate it because he's a tremendous guy. And see him about once every two years when I run into him over at Biscayne. But, um, super guy. 1248. 25 is better than this. You must have died and gone to heaven. Like these are as good as it gets. My favorite are those Catskill Mountain Style garlic wings. It makes me feel like I'm right up there in the Catskill. It's like, it's a sleep away camp. And they come mild medium hot or extra hot. Oh, I know the extra hot must be fantastic. And you can get them extra wet. Yeah, that's my favorite. Or extra garlic. And of course all of the wings come with that great blue cheese and celery for dipping and be sure and dip your wings and whatever else in the blue cheese. Because that's, you know, I was like, I always in every spot mentioned that because if you're good, if you think it's only for the celery, you're missing out on a real tree. It's for the wings also. And all kinds of other great hot subs and delicious sandwiches and finger foods and shrimp and a basket and clam chowder and your favorite beers and wine. Lots more waiting for you at Wings Plus prices inexpensive. The food is sensational. They're on the northwest corner of Andrews and Prospect in Oakland Park.

Okay, any of you will. What these black women are there? Those sounds can give you a little more. Reason to pause right and reflect before you like that man. Okay? Because every politician in America has got to make damn sure that he protects the flag. You can't protect you, but he's gonna protect the flag. Okay? See, they can't do anything meaningful. So they have to do all these symbolic things, okay? And I don't need that, but when they protect the flag, they're also gonna be baking an apple pie at the same time. Okay? Well, Tee-Cee. Yeah. They like that easy stuff. So instead of like having this big runoff and all this for Tee-Cee, why don't they just see who brings the best pie and flat? Here's Miami, hello. Listen to that.

What was going on there before? Oh, I don't know. It's a strange stuff going on in the background. What was the radio? It sounded like Bundy was getting the second dose. Hey, do you know anything about this Bruce Williams? I was listening to this guy the other day and he said Bruce Williams is the most listened to nationwide talk show host in the country. And he says that he is Russia limbo, who limbo is the second. Yeah. Is that true? Oh, probably because they're both on the syndicated things where it's for free. You see, the stations in the night can just slap it on there and it doesn't cost to anything. Like Sally Jesse Raphael. Yes, similar, yeah. Oh, God. What if where she is? Where she is? In a rating. Oh, she don't have much ratings. I don't know. I just forgot. She got those glasses. Yeah. And then, of course, we all know who's right there at the top. Hi, this Larry King. Oh, yeah. There you go.

I guess they're going to run the Johnny Barring. By the way, Johnny Dark, we haven't made a big deal about this, but he is going to be a toy to Holly with a mar. We mentioned a lot of the other people like the Dorcolady and maybe what's your name with her, a panty, he's just a but Johnny Dark is going to bring a lot of people out. We're going to come by and say, are you Johnny Dark WMCA and he's going to say no. But even so it's worth the chance. You know, isn't he? Oh, no. In fact, Johnny is bringing his own jingles. Come on. Yeah, he's got to identify his office. A lot of people are going to say, who the hell is Johnny Darn? Which is why he's not working right now. Because when he was on the air, there were a lot of people saying basically the same thing. He's going to help the guy. He's going to come by. He's going to put a between him and fat rich. They're going to have the Wild E doll tomorrow. It's going to be incredible. And it'll probably be exhausted. Pass out on the cement. So you can buy it. If only to see that.
