I don't want you to be real specific because it could be your last show. W Newsman, I want to see W News News in those 25. Where's the 18 to 34? The bill wise hasn't brought it on. He's pulling this crap again. He starts with this crap because if we beat him in midday, he would never speak to us again. And boy, that would be a high point in my life. 25 to 54. She had a 2 on. I don't know what that's so. The 18 to 34 is what we need to see for she. WI of D.L. for all that at the 38 25 to 54. I know that's down a little bit, but that includes June.

Have you had a day? No. You're from Mr. Traimer. They were better than yesterday. No. And that was when I was going to say I was better than it was. Some day. What did you get on it? Is he behind that? No. No. No. Who called and said dump Johnny dark. I think he had a point. Okay. I think that guy really knew what he was talking about. Anyway, we're, so we get any other ones. The other numbers. Marvin is running around. We're being handed. Marvin Bill wise is coming in here. Oh, boy. You don't have to peek in there. Ah. You saw the girl. You got that smile on his face.

Ah. I eat four, but we went down to was six one. What is this? All right. Again, because you'd love to 13. She with a 5 3 they went down a little bit. Well we're 18 to 34. They all have found it. They've laid it with a 4 2. Love with a 5 1. It's said it would said or midday. This is of course. RMF. RMF. How come like QAM? I wanted Carter. I know he's just tickling in his pants and I'd a QAM didn't make any of these lists. Hmm. Can you pull morning? No, come on. Can't you pull a morning beyond the where this goes? Yeah, would you put that doesn't cost as money doesn't? Well good. That in that case I'm sure. Huh? Well, thank you so much. Money's trying to make it make up for, you know, all kinds of money for it out of here. What year you're such a silly person? I can't stand it. He isn't he? I hope that they sell his brain on the home shop. 1226 course of you a small item. Yeah. 26 past noon Wild. It's the Johnny Dark Show. Stay came with open phones today. Steve does not talk about the ratings ordinarily and I have a feeling today will be an overdose of not talking about it. The Don Hula Show, it's six o'clock sports talk with Joe at 625 and he Yankees at the twins at 8 o'clock tonight. And did I miss anything on here? Power had a 49. It's, you know, a trend. It's only one third of the book. The summer book. And since nobody pays any attention to summer book anyway, you're going to be hearing a lot of alabying all the way through. I'm 100 at a 424 in the morning, 344747 tonight. They're like kind of flattened out, I guess. We, oh yeah, he did bring those eight. So we're down like a six something in 18 to 34. Oh, that's it. They lost you. Thanks to Johnny Dark, who got his hat. Five. And he has the nerve to sit in here filling stuffing his fat face when he caused super-dave a job and destroyed his radial career, a budding career, and a destroyed it right in the butt. Right on the air. Look at that. She looks so much like Solon Greated Day, not Jane Acker, but what's your name? Joan Love it. What? Who's going to become a drummer? Joan Love it? Oh, super-dave. And Joan Love it. Maybe they can make a big music together. Oh, Harry comes ladies and gentlemen with his who tickets under one arm. Oh, thank you so much. Oh, there we go. What did I have the version two way? Look at that. Look at that. A point seven in the morning Carter inherited, I think a point four point five. And he was there two weeks. So they went up a little bit. And oh, I'm in the wrong place. Oh, they went down. Okay. Well, I guess I won't be going to the track with Bill. I thought this was laid out the same as the other one. And they part this is a month by month. Well, it took a little it was that Dick fatherly death now. Geez, Carter is going to be unspeakable. They had a point four. Well, let's wait till the next one. Okay, before we start giving Bill a rough time. Okay. That's 12 plus 2 a.m. from a point six to a point four in the morning. Well, it's a it's a change over of audience. Isn't it? No. Huh? I thought, no. Oh, W. I would be in a morning five ninety with five eight. We already had that. And we, how can we I say 12 plus what is this six a and the midnight Q a m had a point seven. Hmm. Boy, that really sucks the big one. I didn't say it. What I don't understand. What is this? W I O D of four seven in what all I see. This is one of those that's month by month. I'm so confused. I can't even read these. And now we got a four four. Well, what can I say? Things are not good. Not good. They're serving a lot of little puny teeny kids and he's summer survey. These summer months. I mean, like they didn't join us. You're very close. Yeah. Yeah. It'll bounce right back. We'll be right back up to a two. Muram are hello. Yeah. I want to ask all your new bullet fans out there. So I question. All right. All you bullet fans held on a second. What? I don't see the delays at Leon. It is how come I don't have a light on in here. Okay? Not taking any chances these days because they're so nervous. I'm not especially with a guy like that. You think I'm letting him go? How long does it take for that thing? It like to come back on Marvin. My god. I consider and read the entire encyclopedia by the time that I'm still looking at it. Do you see it or did the bulb go out? It's not on. I'm not. I'm not taking any calls to let those back on trust me. Especially when I get a voice like that. It's 12 30 at Wild. I'm telling you it's not on. It's not on. What? It's building? Yes. It's the Empire State Building. Okay? So it's a little Asia building. What's the message? Delay. Oh, now it just came on. It just came on. Boy. What the hell is going on? Why did we go out of delay during the break? We don't go out of delay during the breaks. Why? Oh, this Marvin. I'm telling you that we can't and Chicago. We. Oh, I don't want to hear about it. We weren't in it. We were in it. Sir, are you okay? Yes. Because Marvin don't know what the hell's going on. All right. You all right. He's busy. You're worried about Rush Street. You get it. You heard to just. Yeah. How will I ask you, my little fan of the question? What fan's my little. Mullet. The mimey Mullet. I thought you thought you had another dolphin wrapped guys. You're you going to wrap the dolphins. I just want to know. You know what's the most starts don't you? What? That's when jet many starts to run wild. Oh, these are worse than the meds fans are the jet fans. Okay? In fact, I love the meds fans compared to the jets. The jets are disgusting and obnoxious. And I'm going to tell you something what the hell is the name of your coach? Don't tell me the name because I hated Joe Walton, right? He is the most disgusting subhuman. I hate him with such a passion. I wish every blood vessel and his body would burst. What about you? What about the dolphin's owner? What are you going to say? We love Mr. Robby. Okay? Those of us that are you. Are you Mr. Robby the user? And Mr. Schuola and Mr. Weaver. What are you going to do in jet many runs wild though? Hey, we'll have a good time. We'll just start in last place. I think get out of here. The jet suck and you know it. Call 31 at W. I did. They're still reliving 1969. All over. Just like the meds. They're still reliving. Hey, it's name is the name of the plane. They plan anymore. Hey, the break goes here. What happened to Richard Todd with the ugly bod? What happened to him? Okay? That Joe Walton and he I, oh, with a green cap. He is to football. What Ricky Tickie is the radio. That's exactly what he is with. That disgusting green cap. He's uh, he makes me sick. Oh, do I hate the jet? God do I hate those jets? Call Springs, hello. They'd now. Yeah. You're here right about that delay. It wasn't working a couple minutes ago. Well, it is now. Yes. I was going to want to test it. Hey, you know, jet fans eat so bad. And that's bad. The meds that. Oh, you're wrong. The jet fans are 100 times worse than the meds. 100 times worse. Hey, you know, I wanted to call about. I heard your buddy down in Carl Gables at a little at a bad time this morning. Isn't that a shame? Yeah. I will. That's really a horrible thing here. Yeah. Again, he's starting to get his uh, just deserves to the best as you have to come. Sir, okay? Right. I just wanted to call up and comment on that. Yeah. Well, now that he can't just continue spewing BS now that has to, you know, has to pay the paper in court and speak to attorneys and lawyers and judges and the responsible people. And not just go off the deep. 1233 at W. I. O. D. Sorry. We couldn't have an open line in Broward now where I just hung up. That's five. Five two four. W. I. O. Do see that's why I'm not going to discuss any of that on the air because these people just can't control themselves. Okay, they just have no judgment whatsoever kind of like somebody else. Fat Rick. Oh, boy. You see a ball. I bet you he's really upset. Look at the mess you made on that table. What you look at that? It's worse. Most than when Steve had his bris on the table a couple of days ago, that is disgusting clean yourself up a little bit Johnny and stop being a slob, okay? And you guys guys had used to working as business the worst slob in his story. This Josh. Oh, yes. This Josh. He's the worst in the world. Did you with Reneri calls Steve on now? What is the same? Rose but came. Yeah. Yeah. I heard that last time I rose by any other name. Yeah. It's not funny, John. It's not funny. Okay. Don't you see these numbers? Okay, 1234 at WIO. Do you think? Did we take another little break? I think we just took one. Didn't we? Boy, my head is just spinning like a cradle. I don't know what the hell's going on here. But we stuck right in there, boy. We still had a six in his trend and that's like a major miracle, okay? And a six three and 25 to 54. Once we get rid of that month of June, which will be, I guess when the whole summer book comes out, yeah, we'll be a come out smell and like a rose. Interesting. Yeah. A run. He would go the right. Come on. It's 1234 at WIOD. The get a soon. You'll have a chance to register each week at a rainbow automotive dealer nearest you to qualify for a weekend away with adults. The first trip, Washington's historic RFT stadium as adults and stake on the level at skins. Each week, you could win round trip air fair, excellent accommodations, and great game tickets for you and a friend. He's listening for more information on how you could chase the dolphins with rainbow automotive group and new talk radius 610 WIOD, the voice of adults and sports voice of South Florida. The jet score 24 on answer points. We see the spread of the air sky. Well, 1237 at WIOD, look at that. He's sucking up that died coat there to the last drop. But at least he said it was great anyway. So Boony ought to be really honest because even Johnny Dark was pretty picky for a guy who hasn't worked in two years. He said that the food from science doll was outstanding. Yeah. And he especially liked it because it was for free. Kind of like from the Steve team. Yeah. Well, we got a mobile in sunrise. We'd better get right on. Hello. Have a go and nail. Great. I just tuned in a few minutes ago and I heard you talking about this yet. The what? The jet. Oh, please. I just ate your little soup. They suck. You're right. And Joe Walgreens suck. Isn't he isn't there something about him that just makes you sick? I used to like it. I used to like the jet when Joe name is played for him. Joe Walgreens, you remember Abe Gibberin with the bears at Big Fat, Abe? Oh yeah. Well, Joe Walgreens, he's not fat, but he's the same. He's a slob. You know, Doug Lee. He's with that frontbeat cap and he's always got that same. He's always crying. You know, he makes me sick. You're wrong about one thing though. We don't love Joe Robby down here. We do love John. No, I was just a Joe. Oh, I know. And don't you understand a WILD? We always say we love Mr. Robby. But anyway, Mr. Weaver. I don't I don't call him but, you know, every once every four or five months, I might give you a call. But I got to tell you Berge yesterday show was definitely boring. I had to turn it off with the boring. I mean, it was terrible. Seriously. I mean, I was there. There you go. There you go. I didn't hang on the wall. There you go. By the way, we have a reputal to what he just said. I could never charge for an autograph. I'm like, Weaver. And that's why I've been in for New York Radio 610 WILD. Thank you, Mr. Weaver. Oh, and here's more comparisons. WILD and QAM. I didn't really ask for this. Okay. But it's interesting. I love to see the night time because we keep reading about how they're going up at night, you know, they are. No, they're not. They went down. QAM seven and night went down to a two one. Of course, we went down to a three one from a four two. So, yeah, they're just a sports town. All the sports talk goes on midday anyway. I gave you an opening and you never said a word. I want to a lot of you to the opening there. And you never said, I don't know how I'm expected him to say something. He claims up. I want to say something to that last caller. Yes. Sir, these trends we got today include Neal's vacation when he went to Amsterdam. That's why they're gone a little bit. No. No. Very little. Very little bit. Okay. I just want to tell the last caller that. But anyway, because it is actually we went up in QAM last caller. Yeah, probably in May though. Hey, here to phone, though, or he is so his ego is like so I thought that we know when I was going on. I have him to shame. Look at that rich guy to haircut. He's been not the first time this year. And he looks like he lost another 10 pounds. It's incredible. Anyway, I know rich came in because the Metz one too last night. This is not a sports show. Don't you understand? And tonight they're facing a real tough, uh, what the hell is his name? Scott, the puppet. What is his name? No, he's got to earn run average higher than your weight. So that's like a four foot already. Okay. But let's move along because not everybody scores 13 runs every day, right? And loses Miami. Hello. Hello. Everybody else with the run. The right left. Okay, Steve. Nice call. Steve must have heard the numbers, uh, getting a little bit surely, getting worked out. I guess he won't refer to the numbers at all, uh, because he just fell out of bed in this book and his trend in me. Like, I got rock. 37. Wow. Anyway, well, let's go. I tried to tell him. Have it. I tried to help him. He won't listen to me. It's all those abortion shows. Miami. Hello. Yeah, that's why what's in there that's kind of ridiculous. Thank you. It's a cure out yesterday on Ticket. Yeah. Wow. I didn't want to. I didn't want to admit it, but I'm going to become Orthodoxy. Okay. And even my prayers yesterday didn't help the ball game. So it goes to show you. Hey, but they still scored 13 runs. I don't like those scores. I'm right. Yeah, but there's no other than the red scored in both games last night. That's right. And my Oreo they didn't lose last night. They're doing good. Did they win? They didn't play. Oh, and moral victory. Exactly. You've got it. Have a good one. Okay, you too. Okay, sports talk continues after these very important. It's a 1241 at W. O. D. We just can't shut it off. It's like a faucet, man. It's only like for a faucet. But you're busy reading your PBKets catalog. You're getting a ball. Real. What I don't. I haven't been talking about any of that. Then all of a sudden some Mishmendrick calls before and starts a whole thing here. That's what I mean. You know, a riled up, about this New York crap, you know, and these people just can't handle it. It's true. They go nuts. Listen to him. She's. Just tell me what your problem is. Exactly. Boka. Boka. Oh, come on. Are you stepping us again in Boka? All day. Can you notice? All day. But at least I like the fact that they're keeping the line with them. It doesn't feel better. Why? West Palm Beach. Hello. Yeah. I didn't hear anything about it. I heard a great wording up to work for a change. Yeah. How's he doing? I can't hear him up here. Well, we can't hear him down here either. You move real close to that tower. Hey, look at that. The normal Ken She'll got an ansteris. We can't. Yeah. That's what everybody in South Florida's asking. Yeah. Excellent question. I hear what? What's brother? Pardon me? What's brother? I have one thing to say. New Year's on vacation a couple of times, but a few months ago, I didn't have a chance to call on Tanya. Yeah. The Bird Bird being his author, I'll do as you. Yeah. Do as you. Yeah. Okay. Listen incredible. Joe somebody called him. Okay. And the guy called into... By the way, I need another soda. I just mentioned that in passing. And we don't need it from that.

And in summary of Miami I forgot his first name but his first name is Lachar Alastair and his Richmond. So there's those in Miami too. Those in California. Sir I'm tired of the Susan Lickman jokes okay. We're going to go every day now I understand okay. Every day we got to go with you. You know it's like some kind of punishment.

Yeah Neil how's it going. Okay listen I just like to say one thing first I'm not a cobbison or a blood man but I do like football and I understand Saturday they have this thing called pick a seed Saturday. Really don't understand what it has to do with the game football but I guess I'm into it if they are. Pick up. Yeah yeah but do they have like a laundry mat on the field or something where we could all put our soil and underwear or what? Yeah. Okay the second you know how to be pretty cute. You know who's this guy's that really pissed off at you. Tell like you dropped a couple of ceiling tiles when it closed the door huh? Yeah. Yeah. Who's this guy? You know what's this called? Go to the house and you like your feeding you know what I mean? Fading. What? Like into the business. 116 in W.I.O.D. Well that was a call wasn't it those kind of calls that make us nauseous. Pop a note hello. I know. Yeah. I don't plan. I just call them that asked about the search of the Las Vegas. Yeah. When you after did you happen to get out of the casinos and get away from Las Vegas little bit? No. No. I never left the truck. Why would he want to do that? You want? I never left the truck. Oh no. You didn't go up the strip. Oh no I did that. Down town. Oh yeah. But what do you mean you never left the top of the truck? No. That's the way I felt you know. I said everything I needed. I know when the action gets flowing you need to get away. I used to live there. There's a few really nice places outside of the town to go away to like go up steam and kind of regroup. I'm going off steam. Yeah. You really ought to try to get up into the Mount Charleston resort area. And do what? Just take a look around. It's gorgeous. It's incredible country it is. Oh and the Red Rock Canyon. That's probably the closest to town. It's a really deep drive. Yeah. Well next time I go to Vegas. I'm certainly going to check out the Red Rock Canyon and all those other great you know. I want to be in a casino and gambling and losing your money and having a good time and having all those great meals and checking out all the entertainment. Any idiot could do that. Well like I heard it might fill a bat. Yeah. Like I said there's you know there's more to the southern Nevada than meets the eye. Yeah. And then when you drive up the Reno and you see all those missiles hidden underground and stuff. More than meets the eye. I'm going to go to Tucson Arizona everywhere. Yeah. Can drive around and see what is real. Well for men and men's followers. Yeah. That's why they're turning it into a big retirement time. Well starting to get worried. I think there's something symbolic about that. I'm getting worried there because the town is starting to grow out around the silos. Yeah. We're going to have been a backyard. Well as a matter of fact I noticed in sunrise they're starting with some of those and silos too. Maybe there's something to it. Maybe they're going to target them for hours. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well next time you have Vegas so you think about it. Yeah. And I like I'll check back with you and see what you think. Okay. Thank you so much. I'm thinking about it. One 18 at WIO D briefly we have it open line in Palm Beach now where they have a lots of silos. Six. There's a silo under every house in West Palm Beach. Six by five WIO D except of course on Palm Beach proper because those people got all the big money over there at Palm Beach. They never let them cross the island though they're. That's what up. Bunch of pseudo intellectuals. Slobby, douchebag, uptight, paranoid, spoiled, pampered pusses on Palm Beach. You know what all are you thinking of filthy money? They won't they don't want to talk to Donald Trump they won't let them. That's how stuck up they are. They won't let them in. That's new money. They don't like Newman as opposed to old money. Yes. It's true. You don't think the fact that they don't want them to speak to him because when he went into SD louders house the first time in Palm Beach said, I wanted to make sure back a little bit you left us there there. And from there on it like went downhill for Donald Trump. Okay. It was all downhill. Okay. One 19 that car comes in handy for a lot of things doesn't it? You like that car. I love it. Miami. Hello.
