by hot one of the stations that was involved in the promotion for kiocho and steves said well i guess you're not going to be there right and the tennis well i would not let the uh... we're not going to let the little havana kawani is a runa thing we've already planned for this and we've got a big uh... promotional investment above i'll be there huh yeah thief hung up on me ripped them which was great i loved it because you know the desire to pander at a certain ethnic elements in a community by certain radio stations one of which they are power i find embarrassing you know i mean you have to have some principal somewhere or by the way speaking of tv guess who came out yesterday what a great guy too and he's really getting the chef proof that this business is subhuman bob weaver oh my came by toy of hollywees today weaver and i had a little chat uh... he's just a super guy who one of my favorite people in this town you know every time there's a telethon every time there's a charitable thing or an auction weaver is there being the auction here or doing you know his bit he's on so much for this town for so many years when i first came down here i mean to visit he was here i mean forever and over a channel for the really given him the chef he said he's got to get up at a quarter to three in the morning off do that morning weather oh my quarter to three in the morning and of course you know how much he loves the dog track because he used to own a bunch of racing dogs and he's really into that in love's it and he can't get out there anyway i don't want to you know create a thing but uh... it's really a shame this new guy that they got with a weather map on his face uh... you know is attempting to be a comedian and he's not he's really horrendous but weaver has been here forever you would think that after you pay your dues especially with the same place i realized that station changed ownership a couple of times but even so he's been over there forever and you think after you pay your dues that they would show some appreciation you could have a little bit of confidence that you can work out till you retirement and not be jerked around you know but they've done a real number on a moment but he's just a super guy and i wanted to mention that was nice to see him yeah i can't believe he came out so anyway tenor made a real full out of himself on what's the one friday and uh... kind of embarrassing but doesn't surprise me what else do you know a whole bunch of things oh yeah there was a river phoenix movie on yesterday on uh... movie channel jimmy weird in yeah a night in the life i didn't know what the name of it was that's a great movie i saw it's a funny movie it is a good movie there's more to it and most teen movies yeah to the movie it's a very funny movie it's a bit so i'm not going to mention that he's uh... almost naked in much of the movie and uh... even a he's getting a little bit better he still looks on another something about that face but from the back down he was okay to me but uh... it was a funny movie yeah yeah like to have probably a lot of our river phoenix freaks out there who haven't seen it will just be sitting on the edge of their seats yeah well that our after just pouring through man this is going to be hell of a day i can already feel it these monday's now last monday was like the kissadel but i can well now we've already got a few more calls and we had all last monday there like four lights lighting up i'm not concerned about the phone i'm just concerned about everything else because i could go through a major song of the answer about yesterday about disorganization okay i don't want to do a major attack on ourselves department but i do want to say that it's like um... i mean they're great that we've got so much business that we you know they don't know what to do with it they got money coming in that they haven't even spent yet which was kind of embarrassing as we had these unbelievable t-shirts that kind of like max the bumper stickers and uh... yes today at that parents and they were put out on the table and somebody said that they were charging ten bucks a piece for them i said well if that's the case i don't want anything to do with it okay because i don't know anything about that i'm not here to sell things were here to promote and to give stuff away in cell cars which they had a big day yesterday again including stew and bulk by the way congratulate him and his wife that came all the way down from bulkah and a dropper way in a beautiful toyota camera it was a sharp car with burgundy white with burgundy interior god was a beautiful camera but anyway so we wound up giving away a quantity not all that many i don't know we had maybe fifteen or twenty of them t-shirts good including our friend Joe with five he's uh... who desperately wants one of your old one of those business cards that's got the twins he feels that that you know it's kind of his thing that he created that if i had yeah if i had been there what it given him one you still have something yeah i've actually he's going to come in Wednesday not don't panic now he's not coming in our show he's bringing steve a poster of some of your little one then yeah uh... he's coming in with us given a couple of those out people are just amazed yeah anyway it's ten or fourteen and w i do you have a lot of other kind of things to catch up on here including our sales department i don't want to beat up on him too bad because like i said they've been a great job but they are so incoherent and so uh... spacey man i haven't got any idea what planet they're on fact that we should have put ourselves a problem in the space shuttle uh... because wherever it winds up in outer space they would fit in they would fit in immediately he knows what you're talking yeah yeah i can relate to it he uh... he's gone through the same well a lot longer than we have calm night tribulations with our sales and our cat executive zoo who i think of it hanging around with Henry too long or something yeah one way ticket on the shuttle that sounds good to be look at the left my fear on the substation anyway speaking of subs how about heading for charra they don't have any subs over the what do you mean i'm on you're on i'm on sharing dinner talking about some important heavy duty stuff and uh... you're on we don't have time to be on uh... we gotta get all this mystery and dot from this disorganized bunch of douchebag seat i don't want to get into a bit while i do i do want to get into a big thing because i said it before you know what they say about too many chefs for the brawn and we got four thousand people running around your vault got titles okay we've got like upper level middle upper upper lower lower i mean every kind of management that's ever been invented everybody works here's got a title okay except us although we do have business car at least i got business car jerser coming back again with four ins on the next one but anyway it's like just chaos i mean it's just so much disorganization the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing and last thing i said when i left here friday are we gonna have all the stuff in the truck in the i-o-d thing you know let it be sure because otherwise i'll take stuff with me you know and it just um a lot of confusion confusion and contusions at these things and again a lot of it goes back to our space could at sales people man or just so hyper they need some doggy downers and that end of the building they really do they need some something or maybe some of need two somethings because they're just so hard to control they are that's the operative order they are out of control anyway the rf is just puking through those speakers on the ceiling again and uh it's just another great monday here at w i-o-d we're delighted you could be a part of it okay steam today the samptonoan has got and by the way hope that uh box that i brought Steve yesterday the dog crate works out well with his little his new happy i just wanted to say that on the air so everybody knows what a swell guy and by bringing Steve that craten the holocaust holocaust revisionist david mccaldon who is so extreme that the institute for historical review which he founded kicked him out hmm and the other guest in this or contract controversy will be mark harman i was not interesting mark harman but that's with an i oh Jewish activist concerned about the increase in neo-naziism in the u.s so they're going to be going at it and uh painting each other's foreheads with various symbols david will be paid or mark will be painting a david said with a Jewish star and the david will be painting swastikus on the walls it ought to be a really exciting four hours on the can show and then speaking of excitement of course this evening at 605 well it's too far over there for me to reach um we have the card well it's so far to reach all the way oh yes you think it'll be worth it well we'll find out at 605 it's sports talk with our favorite sports jock that's about as exciting as juggie gacky that's who it is it'll be as exciting as ever okay so anyway I guess we better not dwell on the other stuff because of my creates some unpleasant feeling in the building we certainly wouldn't want to offend anybody especially our account executive right oh no because they're really as sharp as a mottable and of course Lynn who is handling the Toyota Catlin knows out there yesterday to get everybody crazy she's a wonderful human being but ah j i said to her we had been there about an hour and i said this is great this is a lot better than the first one we did out there you know and i know i wasn't counting the people but i just looking at the nature of the people who were showing up in other words there were people of all ages but there seemed to be like more young family type people and young people and just living and breeding people and it just seemed it was for me it was a lot more pleasant she's are you kidding there's only half the people they've only sold three thinking kind of you know whatever sales and as it turned out by the end of the day they had a super day especially on a Sunday which it was a beautiful day yesterday and people actually going do things family type things on Sunday but they didn't have a great day and she admitted that you were witnessed in here this morning but you know as the thing is going on she's giving you odd jada about jada you know like something like what am i supposed to do and of course we get out there we had no idea what time the cut-ins on the log who you know the log was another story and the just the it's incredible it's this business it's like an ongoing almost speechless at this point i'm just starting the stutter maybe it was from that river phoenix movie i'm not sure and speaking of mark harman i want to thank first of all happy anniversary a little belated stan and lory major on Friday celebrated their first anniversary so we wish them the best right and stan uh last evening brought over the bundee the two part what is it the lumbar stranger yeah which i watched again last night and after having seen the movie i discovered two things a i appreciated the movie that much more and b i realized how the movie really sucked okay it was a very very uh super facial it was very super facial movie and the last part which to us in florida is more significant i mean granted he evidently killed hundreds of girls all over the country but the kyle mega mergers and the girl up in lakeland i keep forgetting her name and lake city what is her name i don't remember boy that well anyway the 12 year old girl um that it was like they were running out of time in the end of the second part of the movie so they just like i mean everything was like on not slanting you know haranauts landing is directed we've talked about that before about how they go from one scene to another thing a real fan and that's intentional i'm not saying that's just part of the way the show is done but that's how this movie was done the um bundee thing it was really a really sucked because they just kind of gave a licking a schmier with this other stuff and about how he was caught in the vanny at this van with a soul in license plate and uh and the judge coward came off like a rio jahu and there was just uh he bundee was making his plea closing remarks there defending himself and the coward you know well i sent and she had a die in a curtable electric Kimberly and Lee chants it right Kimberly so anyways 23 past 10 at wild this is just I'm just rambling at this point okay because of in such a state of shock from coming in and just like um it's monday alright they're no question about it we gotta have a special card for monday like on that blows up or something
