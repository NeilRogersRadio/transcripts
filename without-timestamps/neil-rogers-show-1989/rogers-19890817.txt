Um, whoever that's shemendric was, I was going out with Rosen and Bar. I know you don't like her. But he was with more public on a car in a fair. And they were taping the show and they asked how devoted he was to her and he turned around and dropped his drawers on the back of his butt set a tattoo said Rosie. Oh. Yeah, really. Pretty pondering. What is name of the Hum Arnold? Wait a minute. Did they tape it like in a baseball card store? I don't know. Because there seems to be an epidemic of that pants dropping going on a baseball card stores. Yeah. Well, I just thought it would interest you. So well, it was pretty exciting.

Yeah, are you doing? Okay. Hey, bird, are you doing? Okay. Uh, last week when you were out, I think it was Thursday. Bird mentioned something about having the lightning round known Friday? No, no. A caller called up and asked if we could do that. I didn't mention it. Oh, it's all up and asked. So that's kind of dead. Dead. Dead. Bird. Butchard. Why do you want to tell you a show? And I'm a long time listener and you guys have a good day now. Okay. Bye bye. Nice, a botlik there was tremendous. 1239, 21 to 11 WID. So you're spreading rumors that the lightning round is coming back. Oh, I didn't say it. Is that what you said? I just say, what is everybody twist what I say? Why did they do that? You want to know? Someone called up and asked if we could do that. That was all. That's one. I'm so glad I'm here to straighten this out. Cheers. If we could do the lightning round on Fridays. And I believe I said no. Is I recall? Hmm. Thank God. I'm here to find that card. I can't find anything in here today.

All right, See you later. Okay. That now that guy's really horny any one's to the rest of the story. He's got his vanity picture on the wall and he's sitting on his hands. Oh, I got it. Because he doesn't want anything desperate to happen. I got an autograph picture from her. Oh, yeah. It was a highlight. It was a thrill of my life. Well, I don't know that I've seen her, so I can't make any comment. One way or the other. Vanity, she's being with Prince. Oh, you know, I ain't not too long ago. Oh, I think the Prask up thingers. Oh, she's got a group. Yeah. Well, she has. Oh, I get physically you know what I not seeing him just thinking about him. I get so feel good. I got him. Thank God. You probably haven't seen any of her movies because she does like really terrible movies. What do you mean by that? Well, they're dumb movies. Oh, actually they're okay. Action Jackson, deadly illusion. I can't even think of some of them. They're so minor. Hmm. But she's beautiful. She's a minor. Well, I don't say that now. We got people out there that get all excited when you say that. She's a minor's daughter. Yeah. Do I really have to finish the story? The guy is he's like hanging on the edge of the sea. This is going to be tough. This is going to be tough. You gave him this big build up and he's right on the verge of the whole. It was my story was dumped through the whole story. But even here the whole thing. And what was it? Well, it was just great. You got to meet her and you're seeing how you're making his sounds yourself. Yeah, that's what sounds I was making when I met her. Cox was on the air. She was making some personal prints. But I got to to hug her and I got to kiss her. Oh, she's a good news. Is the people around hold got to hear the whole story without all her. Right. Yeah. So eight. He's out right here. That's not the hearing. Yeah. I was on a cloud when this happened. This had been an incredible day. I had a really good day at the track before. I went to power and I said, oh, yeah, big day. I remember that. I had a really good day of fat restying went to the track and then this happened and I go in there for some totally other thing. And I got to meet vanity and I got to touch her and talk to her and you know what is this toucher? What is that? I got to put my hands on her. Other arms and her shoulders. I was cool. I was cool. I didn't lose it. Oh, hey, I get accused of all of this trolling and all of this crap who is a bunch of psychotic garbage. I know every time some young twinking comes in here or you meet them in a hallway somewhere. You're all over them. Like stink on mouth, but this was vanity. I mean, this was vanity and the sample. It doesn't make any difference whether it's vanity. How about that bathing suit? Your own boyfriend was standing in a control room. Are you fondling her? Very similar. Yeah. I'm talking. Trust me. Do you want to find out? Can't get any. Oh and guess what's starting tomorrow? Tomorrow's not. Oh, once for his little Zino about movies and I'm always forgetting the names of movies and the people and I just don't have a mind for it. Okay? I know what you're talking about. Yeah, and I predicted this after the first one was out and everybody laughed at me. I said there's going to be a sequel to this movie and everybody thought I was nuts. Eddie and the cruisers part two. Eddie lives. Yeah. Subtitled. Eddie lives with Michael Paray. Yes. Who if he would keep his mouth shut, looks great. But once he starts talking, he's like, he's like a goofball in a if he would just shut up man. He looks great. But just don't speak. And don't think because he doesn't really sing in there anyway. It's that it's that real ugly slime ball. That's it. What's that group that the things all the music and I'm moving? Oh, um, you know who I'm talking about. Of course. Oh, I can't think of his name. Real us thin and ugly and um, yeah, beaver cleaver is something beaver brown. Yeah, beaver brown band beaver brown band or solid beaver. What is it like that? Look at that beaver brown band. Yeah, but what's the lead singer? What is his name? Oh, he is so me as man. Come on. You can do it. Isn't there an ad in there? It's right there. No, you did it. It's a big ad. How could you message with Michael Paray standing in a odd cavity in the job of the beaver brown band. That's it. He is so I mean he he gives no meaning to the word ugly. Okay, and Michael Paray is lip syncing all the music in that first movie and you think that he's singing. And of course, you know he's not because he couldn't sing his word of a paper sag probably, right? And then you see the video and it's John Caparty singing anything. Jay's come on already cut me a break as Stan would say. Wouldn't he? Yeah. You remember Stan? He's been on Okay, here's a call from McCorral Gable. Hello Oh, geez. They got Batman fever out there in this audience. You're probably up that lady the Batman logo on their driver's license as we speak nobody would do that. Well, nobody Miami. Hello. Okay. Yeah, okay, and I think you would be a good start. So I was like it's the fact that sounded like he was giving himself one with a full receiver, didn't it? Why? I'd get it out of there, pal. You never know what kind of nasty diseases you can get on every seaver. Palm beaches gone. Boy, what happened all of a sudden? I played like five notes to the be well, I'm going to play the whole thing and screw them. Okay, that's one of my favorite records. Here. I'm scared. But we work at Zeta for a year so we learned that it doesn't have to be recognizable to be great. Okay, all the obscure cuts all the time with Tom Robinson on Zeta 4. How you doing, Tom? I don't want to play that. Okay, 22. I'm going to take it home and listen to it in the car. I do like that album. It's a great. If you like the beach boys, spirit of America's name of the album and it's got all these great dance dance dance and breakaway and husherby and little Honda and 409.

We're not going. Okay, such a jerk. You know what? It's pathetic. I've had a lot of idiotic conversations with a lot of so-called management people in this business. But I go in there yesterday. Would legitimate beefs and problems that need to be, you know, attended to that you think he would be concerned about. Okay, did I just can't do anything about it? Can't do it. You know, just to go away. Leave me alone. Let me sit here and look like an idiot. Which is what he does best, man. He's really good to see. He is helpless and hopeless. And when he brings his clone in from Louisville, man, is that going to be talking about the blind leading the blind. That'll be great. My Annie, hello. All right, so six-time home lady, homely blinded and that invitation you give off to Ruth Steve. Okay. My Annie, hello. Hi. She's the same one that called before. Yes. I'm E.L. How are you? Okay.

The music plans. Okay, go ahead. Okay. I wonder why we would be discussing your capacity and theme on the same show. Well, there are a lot of people between two and six who have that heavy green stuff come just automatically flowing out of their system. Mm-hmm. I have one asked. When you, when you, when you see them again, you haven't been hanging out with Henry today. Have you? Because you sound like you and Henry have been having a little party today with Grandma Bohn maybe. No, I've been having a party year alone. Okay. Well, yeah, that's obvious. Listen to you. Okay.

Yes. I'll tell Phil, we don't care. Okay. I don't, uh, no, it's just a joke, Phil. Is it starts tomorrow? Richard Dryfus movie. Yes. Oh, yeah. I know which one that is. Yeah. Well, anyway, the big story is, uh, Eddie and a cruiser. What does it call? Eddie lives. Eddie and the cruiser's too. Eddie lives. Yeah. And I predicted that. That's about the only thing I've had right in the last five years. But as soon as I saw that movie the first time, I said this begs for a sequel because at the end there where he looked in the, he was watching the movie screen, you know, oh, yeah. You know, this is the one. It isn't the so-and-cruede. It took a few days. Yeah. Yeah. The pre-tas in it, let it ride and Terry Garcin. Yeah. And, uh, maybe that's why this guy wants to talk to Capri, the Mr. Message there. Mm-hmm. Okay. 146 at WIOD, a final reminder that these are the final days and weeks. I guess, uh, what, what did the 90s come out to? Does anybody know? They keep coming out earlier. Huh? Real soon. Earlier every year. If I got like to know, this has nothing to do with Toyota Hollywood, but I'd like to know when the 90 vets are coming out. Because I'm going to trade my 88 in for the new R90. Yeah. Good. I don't need to trade my super in because my super is like almost brand new. But anyway, uh, I'm speaking of super. You can get a brand new 89 super with leather interior power seats. A spiffy, out just an outstanding automobile. 19,800 right now at Toyota of Hollywood. And take it from me. The super gives you the best of both worlds.

A number one in customers at his faction Toyota of Hollywood is located on 441 between tapped and Sheridan streets in Hollywood. But aside from that, Joe has got mixed Williams on sports talk tonight for all you cup fans. And I was just talking to Joe during the break and it made me remember, you know, a not only is Andre Dawson hitting again now, but last night he made a catch in right field. It was one of those where, you know, the guy goes back to the fence, leaps up, reaches with his glove over the top of the fence and takes a home run away from Luis Kenyona's. And it was just incredible. So Andre, the Hock is back. Okay. I don't want to get the metspans nervous. And Joe tells me that the pod race court for runs in the first inning against the Metst today, which is a bad break for the Metstans. Who I'm really sorry to hear that. I guess David Con must be pitching today. Just it's just a guess. Did I look in a paper if you got it? We're not sure what I got it. You must have it. You're always on top of the things aren't you? Oh yeah. I'm very close track. Oh, you're not hoarding the sports. You know, let it out, but I know you're keeping very close tabs on those Metstans. Oh, let's see. The, uh, hurt all Viola. Oh my god, what a bad break the pod race for the four against Viola in the first inning? What a bad break for those Metstans. Geez. I guess, so clearly, I'll have to pitch a good game tonight. Okay. It's 151 at Wild. David. Hello. Hey. Hey. Don't. I got a little report from the beach last night. Okay. Oh, report last night. When I tried to look at the eclipse, could see it. Uh-huh. Besides, drive out to the beach for me. You got a better view and just see what's going on. And I guess I wasn't anyone had that idea. Where was Santa Cronett? Families were there and couples were there. You mean, and they weren't arresting them? Wait a minute. Oh, people want to be from. For as the as hate it, it's just great. I guess somebody called for our go count on some day we can't have that. We don't want any fun out there on the beach. Okay. Let's put that crap on cars and a little meter made with their lights going. Yeah, because you can't park it to be jacked on a plot. Don't have people move the cars. Give not tickets. It was unbelievable. Great. Absolutely unbelievable. Well, listen, you know, we, you're going to have to make room for the walkers and the wheelchairs out there. We don't have the room for all the stuff. We have to make, you know, clear it out. I just can't believe that the people who live in for a ride or go shooting at something. They don't care. Now, they don't care. See, you have basically, you've got all these little segmented groups. The only people that make any noise are the old parts, you know, with the condos and a lot of money and they still have the first dime they ever made. And they're the ones that make all the noise and manipulate the politicians. And arrest of the people are oblivious. They don't give a crap about anything. And they don't vote. And they don't get involved. They don't care. So like basically, you've got this one group of old parts that are running the whole town. You know, it's basically like the whole area down here. It's free from Miami North. That's correct. It's like a disease that's spreading up the East coast. Well, it started on soft beach and before you know, it'll be all the way to up. Punta Gorda. Okay. Just end up a little bit. Good job. Okay. Have a good life. Punta Gorda is not even on this coast. It's on a west coast. Well, listen, it kind of like spread her eyes. I'm just right across the Everglades and right through where Lake Lucerne and the Mickey Mouse World man, look out. Pretty soon Mickey's going to be walking around with a beard and a cane. Wouldn't have to be something? We could, hey, listen, I just got it. The hell with Walt Disney. Okay. We can have geriatric Disney land here. Can't you see it? And instead of like ice cream and and sodas, they can sell prune juice at the concession stands and metamusol and polo then and they can have like geriatric cartoon character. Like Donald Duck and have a beard down to his tail feather and he can be walking around with a walker and everything. Great. Watson Island. Yeah. And instead of these big dangerous rollercoasters and space, what do they call space? Mountain and all they don't have that. They can have like little buses that say windmower village on the side and go over a couple of speed bumps. Oh my god. This could be fantastic and they could pick all the old farts up at the condo and as they come onto the bus they could give them like hand them a little up a soft pack. We ought to talk to Jeff about this. Okay. But instead of a sandwich inside there could be a little container of polo then with a glass and some metamusol and maybe some fiber one. We ought to talk to a dentist Collins and see if they can't run a big promotion on this. It could bring them back to life. Coral Springs. Hello. Hi. How you doing? Is this Neil? I think so. Oh, good. Are you ready for geriatric geriatric Disney World sir? Oh, little over my age group. Yeah, or even the old people can't have fun. I would be perfect for and you're in coral springs, which is the epitome of not having fun, right? Even caught in fact this call could be illegal in coral springs. That's my deep. You were talking about who should be on with the bird when you've got to do the show without you. Yeah, and I'd like to make a sympathy vote for Eric. It's strata. He needs to work. Eric. Eric. Ships. Oh, man. From chips. Yeah, it's hilarious. Huh? You need to work. I'm sure he does. Boy. Did you ever hear about the book that is x y for what about him? Did you? Good. What are were they married for about 10 minutes? You said it was a marriage of convenience or something like that? And, oh, it was pretty nasty stuff. Now, we don't want Eric to strata on the show. Why are you like some kind of an Erica strata freak? No, it's a little sympathy vote. Now, come on. You can admit it to us. You sit up there with like a blow up doll of Erica strata and kind of like on your lap. Huh? Picture's on a wall, maybe? I should watch chips like this. He just watched chips like over and over again, right? Okay. Well, it's on us. He's got a guy on next week who maybe can help you. Okay? Have a great day. Okay. Boy, I think we got a real problem developing their in-or-l-l springs. We better get Batman on the case for that one. Okay. Ships. Yeah. Batman better write a letter to that young man and tell him he's on the road to hell and I am a basketball. Boy, you and I couldn't handle that Erica strata. Okay. Anyway, let's go to a beautiful Pombie, shallow. Hey, guys. How you doing? I didn't think I was going to get on. Well, we wanted to make sure that you got on before we ran out of here. I think you will. I've got a WPBR as far as forward. Now we're talking heavy duty. Haven't talked about it, but you may not know about it. Have you heard about our latest weekend talk show host? No. Jim, Tyler. Really? Yeah. Well, listen to that. Boy, he talked about desperate and eating work. Right. The 7 on Sunday. Really? Yeah. PMI, assume. You know what he does? No. Basically what you do. Oh, he's doing his ripping off this show. Yeah. Well, that's okay. He did a lot of clever English and wrote his stuff so he can probably play it himself, you know? I heard him. I think it was his second show. And he does a little intro and then he says, let's go to the phone. Yeah. Don't care. First caller is lead from both Hello, lead. Absolutely. No. Are you cereal? I didn't want to get that. That's Tyler boy. Well, this is a great report. I'm sure glad you got on before the end of the show. I think that might identify somebody. Might open up some ears and eyes for a second. I just wanted to let you guys know about it. I know you can't hear him, but he's not half bad. No, he's a great guy. Really? Even if he is out of make believe radio station, you know, we all need the work. He did your meal, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's my report. Thanks a million. Okay. It's like he also did what Joey Martin doing tonight. And crying minds want to know. That's why inquiring minds read the Miami hero is Maurice for a really having sex with an alien from outer space. It's in the head. He's probably hawking the true mother of the elephant band. It's in the head. John Kennedy sleeping with Matt. It's in the house. It's Jim Baker about to get birth to Jerry Falwell, baby. It's in the house. That's sex. That's more hot. That's all it's in the house. Well, scary heart amazing. Right style from Florida. A crossword puzzle that has no answer. Our own Pulitzer Prize is just for us. That's not that it's to Neil Roger. And we're so sorry, Uncle Albert, but we haven't heard of anything all day. Finally, happily better. That's all in the latest issue. The Miami hero. A big little supermarket check out counters everywhere. And we're a fighter maneuverer. It's crazy. As long as that splices on the car, you'll always have that as one of your favorites. Anyway, that guy from Carl Springs, we just traced the call and we're sending him our Erica Strata package. Uh huh. That's got like an Erica Strata chips, John strap and underwear. And it's got an Erica Strata blow up doll inside. And it's he's just going to be sitting up there inside. We'll never come out again. Oh, yeah. Anyway, who's that on the bat line? Is that that's probably when a next inside private calls, okay? Probably when a next spies? We're almost out of time. 158 at Wiod. Who is that? That for us? Oh, it wasn't, but it's for us and they're gone. Who was it? Right. They're gone. Hello. There's nobody on there. What does he try to say? And it was at a crank call? It was a real call. It was after, or after the show. Well, we ought to put that on. That's the good stuff. That's what people are excited about. Well, that's going to do it. I can't believe it. I'm just getting rolling here. You know, I'm ready to do another two, three hours. But unfortunately, we're fresh out of time. We're plum out of time. As they say in the fruit business. So have a great day and Steve is coming along next. And even if you hate his guts, okay? I would stick around because man he seems just erotic in psychotic. Mostly psychotic. He is just ready to go and ready to wear and go. And then we got Mitch Williams. Joe's going to have a little interview. He did with Mitch Williams of the Cubs on Sports Talk tonight. And the Yankees in the Tigers at 730. And we'll see you again tomorrow morning at 10. Here on 610, Wiod.
