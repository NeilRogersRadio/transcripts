Mother, he is may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD. I'm a cut man, I know but man, but I trust you are true. Here's the cut man. There's a long line since the fair. And by the end of the day, it's a great plan. A great plan. Holy Paul. I guess we're wearing one of the crowns. I wonder how the Metz fans slept last night. 1006 in WIOD, I'm not going to rub it in. We don't have to have a big Timothy about it because we have two anti-Sports people in the studio today. And they're really silly. We have Johnny Dark with a different shirt on today. I wouldn't say it's a new shirt because it's badly wrinkled. But it is a different shirt. So that's something that's a step in the right direction. Anyway, here we are again. We've got lunch coming from Wings Plus today, which is why Johnny is here of course. And I see that Andy and Todd are both still in the building at the moment, which means they might actually come in and have a little lunch. Probably the big shots are rather town again or something because they don't like that. They don't want these interns schmoozing around in here. They want them out there working their butts off. Okay. Oh. Also, we have racing at Calder again today after the weekly two dark days on Monday and Tuesday. Phil will be pleased to know that we are not picking in the first two races. We don't have to be at Arrest again. Why do you got to get the lay of the land? 6th race, I'm going with another Jewish horse, Matt's stick with Gonzalez. Why is it Microwise all these Jewish horses? Hmm. Wonder what's going on there. And then in the ninth race, in the featured Delray Prep, Mr. Bird is picking at land and national, written by Steve Gaffleon. Tough. Yeah. Can I get some lighter sematches, do you think? I don't want Roger to have to come in here because he's overworked already. But it's really difficult. I don't want to get Steve upset because he's very anti-smoking, unless he's smoking a cigar. They just minded at all. I do want to say this. I didn't hear much of that show yesterday, the juniors, but when I was driving to my mother's for dinner, I heard this goofball calling and Steve called him a subhuman douchebag. Wow. Yeah, look at that Henry. Hmm. Well, I tried to listen to that show over and over yesterday. Henry, I just serviced my cigar. I beg your pardon? No, that's an interesting way of putting it. What did you say? I had trouble. I tried to listen to that show many times. Now you're not going to rip Steve. Are you? Oh, nothing to do with Steve. All I did was say he said subhuman douchebag and I almost drove off the road. But I had trouble with the show. That's all I'm saying. You had trouble with the show? I had trouble with it. Well, obviously he did too. Yeah. So I was desperate, you know? Well, his Chinese thing had a Peter doubt. So I punched over to Alice. Guess what he was doing yesterday. You know the rumor has it. Marco Polo was like a butterfly. Okay, Alice was doing what? Drinking urine. Again and not again. And these old fossils were calling up. Oh, Alice, it's wonderful. You should drink your urine. Trust me. It'll help you. Oh, my God. I wish we had TV. There's a thing out of USA today that Roger gave me. Here it says New Jersey may sign up for elderly crossing. And it's got a new traffic symbol. And they're trying to work it out. There are these senior citizens are very upset about this. The show is too dottering old figures with canes slipping across the street. But what I like it says creating a new sign could take anywhere from two to five years. Don't you like the way the government spends our money? Could take two to five years. What they might want to do is have like a kind of a figure of cloth lying in his casket. But yeah, it's kind of a warning that this could happen to you. And it could say how on deal be to full of art on the street sign. Something created like that. Anyway, it's nine minutes past ten at WIOD. I wonder if our lady friend from Cooper City. Oh, they're the good news is we have it. I got the cart right in my hand. But I'm not going to play it unless she's listening. Oh, right. Good idea. Bill Deal and the Ron Del's. And you said despite why is this morning, take a look at this. He looked at the label and he said, what's that? No idea. That man knows his music. I don't want to go out on a limb. Okay. Like picking northern wolf into pre-cnus. Yeah. I don't want to go out on a limb. But I'd say he almost knows his music as well as rose Folger. Wow. No. I know that's pretty. Oh, Henry statement. But I would say it's pretty damn close. Okay. God. Anyway, that Broward number is five two four WIOD. That young lady from Cooper City who called yesterday is listening. I don't want to play it unless she's listening. She's probably in a car somewhere right now, frantic. But they will wait a little while. Okay. And if she's listening, I want to make sure she gets to hear it. Because she was nice, won't she? Very. A bitch of that's her right now. Hello. Hello. Oh, I know what I did wrong. I didn't do these yet. Oh, boy. This is the best. Hello. Yeah. Like Park with Meal's Board. Well, that's the young lady from Cooper City. Hold on, pal. Don't go in. What a bummer. She on there. Hello. Hello. I'll be done. I turned it on just in time. Boy, that's loyalty, isn't it? Serious. You are incredible. Well, I'm sorry that yesterday we led you down the path the whole show. And then some caller to Steve rip me yesterday. For spending all that time wasting all this time, searching for records. I mean, you took the law. I mean, that you took that time. It looks for it. Well, I'll be honest with you. I was desperate. You know, because you really wanted to hear it. And I knew it. And I still can't find it. That's the amazing part. I mean, I got the song thanks to Johnny Dolan. But I can't find my CD. So evidently, somebody ripped it off. Oh, no. So somebody else, somebody else must like Bill Deel and the Rondrill's room. Yeah. Well, I'm going to play it right right after the break. Okay. I'm going to do a little break and I will play it. I'm just tickled a death that you're listening. Oh, no. Nobody else's listening. The fact that you are makes it worthwhile. Okay. Thanks Neil. Have a great day. Isn't that nice? Amazing. It was because she's nice. And there's so few people in this town who are nice that it's shocking is Renery would say it's shy. Anyway, it's 12 minutes past 10 at Wild. Do you believe he's having clock or Sydney back on again Friday before the Belmont? See, one thing about Mike is he just cannot say no. You know, he knows it is mine. He knows that some of these Hallearies really need to be put on the bus with boy Gary Louisville or anywhere. But he just, he just too soft hard and he can't say no. We do hear him whimpering in the background though, but Clock, or out the clock is Sydney. It's going to be picking if he does his well in the Belmont as he did with a Preakness. I would run to the bank right now. Make a huge withdrawal. Okay. Anyway, and of course after the race, you'll be making a gigantic deposit. I don't want to say where. Kind of like my dogs. Tell star 34. Now that was worth waiting for wasn't it? Oh yeah, real worth waiting for. He's not like she's waiting for Alice's show. Ask she's got a box out of Carter and of course, so does Claude Pepper. I think Claude has a box under a call. Well, something like that. Anyway, to continue with those things, sports talk last night. Little sports talk, spider fort. When the UM game was continually delayed because of the long college baseball game before it, Hank got bored of talking sports to started reading the rack. Hank Ober was talking tonight about how much he likes you by the way. Thanks one of my favorite people. I want to ask you. I don't come any better than Hank Goldberg. Go ahead sir. Yeah, he was reading the card rack to a caller. He thought he was reading yours and he was reading what's his name. Rogers. Yeah. Now he was reading all this stuff from before you. Then he sort of read through your card rack and play a Vatican rack. Did he? Well, that's great. That was good for sports talk. Yeah. Well, even a pop-as-as-sports fan, you know? I guess he would be with me. Sure. One more point for you. If he changed his words around who wrote those name, he'd get real dark. Okay. Good day. Have a great day, Pat. I see what you mean about this being a real good day. A very education bar in a lot. For our own burn. 1035, we have two open lines in Dave County. I don't understand that. Must be some kind of another one of those four infestibles. 1051, 9463, 751, WIOD. And no matter what language you speak, you're going to love the delicious food at Charhut because it's fresh. It's made with the best ingredients. They use only prime ground chuck and they grind that chuck every stinking day. Man, they don't bring you stuff that's been frozen or sitting around. It's as fresh as can be, just like their sausage. They grind those pork butts fresh every day. And they even take the bone and skin off their chicken. Every day in the neighborhood for your fresh, the way you want it with all the toppings that you'll love. And they even offer you Kaiser rules for your sandwich. So when you get it like an Italian sausage there with all the things I like on it, it's an entire meal. Not just like a little teased to your appetite. So instead of the fast food junk food joints, you had for the great place. Charhut, there are seven in South Florida. And don't forget the official Neil Rogers Charhut refillable squeeze bottle. We'll be available starting July 1st. Okay. And spite of what any rumors you may have heard. There are seven charhuts and they're open right now for early lunch in four Latterdale sunrise, Tamarack, Davy, Hollywood Miami. And the newest Charhut at 306 North State Road 7 in Margue. Okay. We got an open line in date at 751 WOD. Now what were you about to say in that time radio? What is that? We got another mobile. Okay. We'll go back to Johnny. I know how the hell this is of the market in the second. But we got a mobile on it. Well, we got to get to these people are spending a lot of money to speak to us. Right, sir? You got it. Okay. We got a little piece last night too. Good. You got a little piece last night. Well, congratulations, sir. It's about time. Yeah. Hey, I caught the burden of background there. Not to get personal burden, but I can help. They say you massage your head. It'll grow back. They do say that. He's right. You got him in massage. He will grow back. You got him in massage. It'll grow back. How about your head? Well, that's a different story. I see. Covering yourself. Okay. One more spot report on the Colonel's point. Yeah. He's hearing him give his birthday call. I didn't hear any of it this morning. I missed out. Eight o'clock in the morning calling. Terry, Maryman, and home to wish her happy birthday. Oh, yeah. She's got sucked in on that show boy. That's going to hurt credibility is zero at this point. Well, he was being all excited about calling her with you as a bed. Can I know what we're going to play? Let's see if there's some interesting stuff on here, or not as a case maybe. She loves my dearsion. Beassembling up each white whale. She puts on a location with the muffin and giant pale. The cream just she asked me. Do I look all right? Do we truthful? You got to myself, you like. Yeah. I'll give that about a six and a half. That was good. Okay, this could be interesting. You found someone who loves you, true. It's not all that hurt my mind. You said my house is like a sewer. You were front and sewer-side. You say I'll live in like a caveman. Have proof that it's a crime. If you stay, I'll take a shave man. Be sure the toilet seat is down. Give me a break, give me one more chance girl. You said for you, true. You said for you, true. You said for you, true. You said for you, true. You said for you, true. This is a very good show. Okay, so we got the straight poop now. Again on the cane show. The saga. China's bloody revolution will be the topic today. Colonel John Larson, should lick. We'll be one of the gang. Yimtaam. She's a Chinese-American student. Only loves sweet and sour pork. And David Daley, Oliver Norrts, former roommate. So boy, you put that group together. Wow. Now that's what she got to show. Yeah, so it says, the Yimtaam should lick David Daley. 1242, it doesn't go like that. What happened to this thing here? It just died. Oh, I see. I probably am on a wrong cut. You think that makes a difference? See, a vester's alone's back. In this time, he's headed for another one with a blow. It's fly and a family's alone. I want a thank you for letting me. Thank you, Dave. Okay. Come on, this is good news. Fly and a family's alone. Your gut will rip as all busy with red. World is his way through this day loose. I'm direct, yes. There is the Y-1 who watched the kill. The red one who watched the wish. The yellow one. Oh. Kill every day's storm. I'm just a little bit hot. Good in the summer times. Nothing like a hot garden. A hot time. I'm just going to get you. I'm just going to get you. A baby will ever see my automatic weapons or so. Hmm. I bet that was cute. Cute. Well. That's not the worst. Don't play ball, play the odds with the beat rose talking. Baseball card. Let's go. Man, I'm a ball game. Make a sound, make bucks. We don't care who loses their wins. As long as we make the spread again. Rose talking baseball card. It's fun. It's profitable. It's educational. It's illegal. The P-Rose talking baseball card will have the fans calling foul. Only 1495 or five to three or eight to six. Get yours. Wherever racing for them. So. Time to talk about wins. Plus now. What is this from Sweden? Are you going Neil? Okay. Well, let me go farther. Do you and I got a good night trying to defone? Did night tell you to get a life? Yeah, it's only three times to get a life. But I don't know. I think I just give you phone calls. You give me no chance. Okay. This is your last chance, pal. Yeah, long coming home the more. Are you really? Yeah. Got to find in the more. Great. So how's all our Swedish friends doing over there? They're doing good. The weather's a little gray, but. Mm-hmm. You know, I think you're on the front line. The up and up. Well, there's a lot of folks who are a little gray here too. So I guess they'll all leave out when you get back. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, do you have any last minute questions about Sweden before I leave? No. No, okay. Can you put me on the whole for the rest of the day? Sure, no problem. Where are you? What line are you on? Uh, I don't know. Line that sign. Line five. You might even get on the lightning rod. Hold on. You're calling collective course. Of course. Okay, hold on. Okay. 12.50. That out of the build real good. Eight. Oh, boy. You're going to be alright now. I see you in a little. Do you take the mail out? Yes. Watered the flowers and everything's fine now. I ran into someone in the hall. Really? When I was walking out of Rick Weaver. Rick Shaw? We get serious. And he said to me that he's going to come in here for cross plugs. And he soon as he's finished his zero oxen. He'll be in here to do some cross plugs. Oh, speaking of Rick Shaw. Just the word we? I just want to warn you about that. I've got to do this right. So you're not surprised. I'm trying to think of what part of the record. I think it's like three. Well, I can, we'll do this one. You want your dissonance in the tape and show. Three, I say three, three, four, five. Okay. I guess listen to this. It's got to be the one. Yeah, it is. Good video. I'm just a school. I'm just a good son. Best call on the album. I'm right between this and written on the subway wall. Both so great. And of course, somebody next door couldn't be the same person you're referring to. We'll not play the D on cuts on GTR, which he'd make it a bad mistake. You're making a bad mistake. The guy who takes you. Mr. I lived dangerously. You're not really heavy duty dangerous stuff like the Beatles. You know, here it is. Well, when I hear that, I just go, I flip my cat on the crazy. Anyway, I sure wish we had time to take some of these very important calls. But we got to do, I mean, he spent all his time dubbing. And we got a little digest you do now. Don't worry. I like this better actually to do this. What's that? What you're going to do? I'll let it digest and settle down on everybody in the audience. Calm down. It was a very tumultuous lunch that I wasn't it? It's at the wow. Yeah, it was pretty, we got people in here that I never saw in the building. That's true. People I'd never ever leave with had a line from here all the way to the causeway. It was incredible. And even Cheryl came by twice, not once, but twice. What is that? I'm proud of her boy. She's got to start getting with it, you know. But I won't rest until we have boy Gary coming one day and have food in here. Wouldn't that be something? I weighed every day every day. Just have a little tidbit of something. You know, it's got a breakdown. You've got to admit that he was dead wrong. And even though it's bad radio, it's great lunch. Yeah. You know, I will come up. Every day I make a lot of tough decisions in life. And one of those is whether you're more concerned about bad radio or good lunch. For me, it's not even a contest. The water's a two-lower. Okay, ladies, gentlemen, Mr. Puts himself. He's going to just do this. Here's the guy who takes the chances. Yeah. Mr. Excuse me for not having the guts to take a chance. Ozzy Oz borne my ass. Get out of here. Well, yeah. 97 GT. Crank it down. Crank it down. Who saw the punga here, okay? I love that. This is good. Great. Great. This is a good song. Great. Read. Only station in the market that has the balls to play a tremendous song, even if it's not on the computer list from me. Focus, grew in a good song. And the maggots study in the 75 kids up the street, you know? We need to imagine how people twist things around in their minds. He fired Neil Rahn. No. No. If that's the case, how come I have a letter of release from them from my contract that I had a scream and holler to get and let me out of the contract so I could come over here for almost double the money? How come that is? I wish my mom and daddy owned a radio station. Ha ha ha ha. Yeah. How come Tim Williams has the job over there, okay? He works hard to get. As Arce Bunker would say, maybe because it's all in the family. You know what I'm saying? You do spag. You slime ball. What an idiot. Yes. You fired. See, even if he had, that would be one thing. But he didn't. Oh. Because that would have been too embarrassing. They didn't even fire, stand major. They paid him off. They didn't fire him. If you fire somebody, they're just gone. If you pay somebody, they fired out their contract. That's a little bit different. But with us, we just said goodbye. In fact, I remember that day I said to both of them, leave it. And he said, oh, I said, yeah. I said, oh, back you sandwich. Yeah. Oh, no. He put on a little act there in the beginning. He did. He did. He did. Oh, I could tell stories about that, joy. Man, from now to for a month, all till after Shavouis. A bitter pill. Yeah. Better pill to swallow. He was doing sleaze radio. I got news for that show on Zeta was about as sleaze as chocolate milk. Okay. That's how sleaze you was. They took every stinkin thing away from us. That we ever dreamed of doing. Oh, we don't want to think creative if you're thinking of that for a good. We just want to real save show. And we'd rather be number three, the number one. They took everything away. So how could we have been doing a sleazy show? Okay. And isn't it interesting how they got a segment now with their wonderful upright guys in a morning? A thing that sounds dirty, but aren't. And they do everything as filthy as they can possibly get away with on here. That's okay if they do it, see. That's a good show for the entire family. Yeah. I think they even say some of the things. Oh yeah. filthy is crappy. They even are human and are embarrassed. And that's almost impossible. Okay. But it's okay if they're doing it. But we were doing it. It was a sleazy show. And they were doing a new time. Is that what it means? Seer times has a 1.5. Yeah. I guess. The bottom line is what you said earlier. They didn't have the balls. Yeah. That's correct. Oh, it is correct. That's why they got rid of all their talk. They didn't have the stomach for it. Yeah. Because they're a little mom and pop company out of Portland, Maine, who don't have any clue what this market is all about. They even failed in little markets. Okay. They had a seller station like in, um, Davenport, Iowa. Wasn't it? Davenport? Some market. And Oklahoma City and the Coco Beach. I mean, no matter where they had a station, and they failed. Can I, um, do my statement about Tim Williams, truth or please? We, when we were at, don't take more than 20 or 30 of us take long. We were in CTA. We, in Gary Lawrence, was the general manager of me. We were brutal. We ripped him to shred. Yeah. Every day now. I think everything we said about him was basically valid. However, compared to Tim Williams, he was a brainster. Gary Lawrence. I'm genius. That's all I wanted to say. That's it. Yeah. That's my statement. He's Gary was a good guy. Yes, he was. As opposed to Tim who walked around in that position like he had a load in his pants all the time. You know what I'm talking about? I'm going to hang out with that kind of strange. Oh, man. I'm telling you, that, that story there, that is the most incredible. Unbelievable. You talk, and I bet you he believes it. Yeah. I bet you he's twisted around in his own mind. Big lie. Yeah. Well, let's see. We're sitting here with about an eight-share and a sold-out show. And they're sitting over there with a one-five. And a one-six on the station and an-a-m with a two with demographics that are so old. But they're thrilled. And they're thrilled. They got got glad that you have your New York Times image. Okay, and that you're starving to death over there. Okay? Because you couldn't, nobody could deserve it any better. Look at that. He's so worked up about it. He's going to go check the mail again. He is. I'm telling you, that's just not Tim for a loop. 23 after one at WIV. Time to talk about one of Johnny's favorite restaurants. Papers, Ali, and plantation where you are going to find a delightful, which is saying a lot. Anyway, it's 134. Don't forget on the Steve Canesho today. It's Yim Tom, should lick a griver day. That's Tom, should lick David Daily. That's the list of Sharon gave. That's going to be like a Chinese orgy here today. I know, that's starting to new revolution. And Steve's going to be previewing that great new flick called, I like fat Chinese children. Yeah, that's it. Anyway, let me a one more time remind you that on Saturday June 24th, and by the way, the guy yesterday was a subhuman douchebag that you were referring to. I almost drove off the road when you said that. Is that the one with the eyes? Yeah, Paul got all he, very, oh, drives you nuts. And he never goes away and just hangs over the table. Him and his friend from Playoffs, the round the Mr. S stands for something we can't stand. Mr. Mong. Oh, Jesus. Anyway, Saturday the 24th, we will be there without those guys or the guy with the dog. If they do show up, we're going to have a special van to cart them away. The same van that carts away to broken down horses at the track. But anyway, we invite you to come out that day because we're going to have a lot. They tell us they're going to be prizes. I mean, you know, got only knows when you're dealing with Lynn and sales. But she says they're going to be fantastic prizes. And of course, we'll have the bumper stickers and pictures. I guarantee you tons of food there that day. Oh, prizes and surprises. And surprises. They say the business of what's here. And of course, while you're there, we want to lot of you to check out the great deals. Because during the summertime, man, with the summertime blues, you're going to find savings like never before. I was beautiful 89 to a lot of. So kind of like make a special date on the calendar right now. Okay, because we know that Lynn would never change the date on this again at this late date. Saturday 24th at Toyota of Hollywood on 441. We tapped in Sheridan streets in Hollywood right up the street from Charhot and right across from Disalvoes. Hey, Neil. Yeah. What's happening? It's Tom Palm Beach. Brush my West Palm Beach. Why? You know, is that your name, Tom Palm Beach? No, no. Are you related to Tom Palm and Ocer? Hey, I feel like I read you a radio person who was Tom Palm Beach. No, Tom Palm Beach. Why do you waterdale? Not in Palm Beach. Uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. We're really homestead. There you go. Yeah, got a little, uh, little fun for you. Got a little something, huh? Can you answer us? The word that can I handle it? Well, if it's a little something probably. You, uh, you, you, you. Okay, one 39 in WI. You're wrong. Yeah, he was wrong. He was wrong. He did. You know, chorus lines up here and trying on the cause. We've already got enough other action going on. And of course on the Steve Cancho this afternoon, Yim Tom should like David daily. Uh-huh. And Hank Goldberg with Sports Talk is 605. And 730, we got the Orioles in the Yankees. And he's actually one of the game last night, which was pretty damn exciting. And then on the Larry King Show tonight, Kevin Mitchell in 22 is it now. 22 homeruns keep in mind the season is just about a third over. And this guy is going at a rate. He would hit 66 homeruns and driving about 180 runs at the rate he's going right now. The guy's unconscious. Okay. He's going to hit 100 of his rookie quite as 60. Now you don't have him in a rotisserie league, though, do you? I don't play that. Oh, man, this rotisserie baseball. I'm telling you, every time I speak to Norm Kent, he's like, run on the edge of his seat and he's worried that this one just got injured. And his rotisserie league is falling apart into the question he's back in line up. Oh, it's a roterie. He's in Tom. Yeah, he's in conference on rotisserie baseball. He's trying to trade the Frishan Dunst and now that he's hitting. He's out of his mind. He's very important. He's in the rhythm. Man is a great attorney. But he's living his second childhood and basically, oh, I can tell you. Miami. Hello. Hey, hey, what's going on, pal? There's a merch. I got 10 sounds like a real, uh, a perfect barmer with a taxi cat. Yeah. Strapping the bottom of the barrel. Uh, hey. Uh, I just heard, uh, Alice. And she just put me into a slight coma. Alice. It's a little early for Alice, isn't it? Oh, yes. Oh, yes. He was drinking at, uh, uh, uh. Hey, Neil, can I hold off for the lightning round? I knew you saw what you got in God. You know what it is, right? Yeah, you know who it is. Just put them on. Just put them on. It's, it's just, no, it's not who I think it is. Yeah. It is. Maybe. Oh, sure. I'm going to be the best. No, no, no. Good luck. You're out of can if you should get disconnected. Don't blame me. It'll be an active God. Oh, man. Is he something? He's like, uh, who's he? I don't want to like, vague. One of those people you cannot insult. You know, he just keeps coming back and coming back for more. Hmm. Reminds me that guy with a blue, um, car. Bob something he used to come in a morning and when those prize. Oh, you're from Sun. Sun, Rob. Some sunrise. Oh, what? He even shows up on a remote. Does he? Oh, man. He's just so creepy and so, um, they just boogie. Yeah, spooky. They're the classics for now. And one of the Bill Wise's favorites. One of his picks for the week. Miami. Hello. You want to hold, right? Yeah. Okay. Well, I can tell by the sound is, how many? How many? Oh, man. I don't know. I need to keep track. Four, six. Six, eight lines. And one of them is blank. Six are on hold. Six out of the seven. It leaves West Palm Beach. Yeah, please go. Okay. Well, I guess that kind of backs us into the quarter now. No, no, no, that's funny. That's all right. Well, it's just about time. There I know it is. It times out pretty well. I will say this. Boca is not done. There it go. Just as I said, it started to flash. Hello. Yeah, can I hold the light? Sure. No. Okay. Now we're all set to go. We'll do our last break. And then we'll come back and have a good exhausting lightning round. And then we can say. Water bars. Right. Wow, what a show today. I was right. And the lunch from Williams-Postive-A. I am going to tell you. Hmm. Boy. I still can't get over. It was like something that happened. But then you have to wonder whether you dreamed it or really happened. That's how good it was. Yeah. Here and came in again. And she made a disgusting comment about Ross' lips again, which I can't believe. And it's like always it's been a long time. It's always a Batman and Robin. And it's a lips. You have a session with lips. Yeah. And guys, that's really like Steve Tyler Lips, Sharon is ready to meet you in a hallway. Nick Jagger would be good. No, not good enough. Anyway, Johnny Dark before we go to Lightningrod has got another incredible story. Wanna tell us on a year? Why am I? Well, we're going to tell you the few don't. How do you want to tell our story? Oh, he wants to get hired. No, he's going to work for them. No, he doesn't want to work for them. Anyway, he was over there visiting our Githy, your friend Jeff Gonser, picking up his acid casualty t-shirt that he won in a morning show. True. Since John could get right through since going through three people by the end. And he was in a chat with Jeff who courses so any bullet, it's usually disgusting. And Ross Fulger came into the control room and said, well, it's nice seeing you, John. Goodbye, you're going to have to leave now. Kicked his ass out of the building. You think there's a little paranoia there? Yeah, very. Just a little bit of paranoia over in Carroll City. You bet. Sure sounds like it to me. What the hell did he ever do to them? I mean, just because he repeats everything to watch that he finds out. That's beside a point of, if you've got nothing to hide. You know, isn't that what Alex had your Haguewoods say? Absolutely. And it means if you have nothing to hide then just open up the doors to the closet. Let's see what's going on there, okay? Right? Exactly. Since I was fired by Tim Williams, my life is really turned upside down. I just cannot believe that the man would have the Hugs to say that, especially if you guys with young children like them. It's 10 till 2 at Wild and we're ready to go now to this part of the show that most of us are pretty damn embarrassed by. They'd count, he'll know. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Bobby.

Pardon me for using the Ills Material Goldberg from 6 to 7 30. 30, then at 730 Yankee Baseball with the Orals and of course Larry King tonight's gonna breathe on Sammy Davis Eyeball and it's gonna cause a stir that even worry put the gun. Have a great day, I'm gonna rush home and watch the Cubs win again and we'll see you tomorrow morning again here on 610 WIOD. And then he comes in here and the Rips are sponsored, our dear friends at Wings Plus. Please now listen, I don't want any of this to go wasted today because boy when we start throwing stuff out. People are starving. We have a good day now. We have no, but I'm just on you. Now we've had days when there's been some stuff that kind of lingered. You know what I'm saying? Well these are good and hot today too. You like it hot? Yeah, right. Oh yeah, he's from Plant City. He loves it hot. Anywhere there's some chili here too which I think I might have a little bit of if we have any do we have any utensils? I'll have a little piece of that sandwich too. Look at that. Well we got it all. They went crazy today. There's a forks and the spoon. What is this? Oh my god. Look at this one today. Have you ever in your life seen a steak in cheese with onion like that? Yeah, I'm having half of that. Once the other half. What do you know? We're a momma eight Wings today. Just Wings? I think so. Once the other half of this incredible sub. Okay, Cheryl. Cheryl's got this. Where's the plate for Cheryl? I feel like we're in an auction or something here. Isn't this incredible? This is something great today and it's also kosher with a steak in cheese. Anyway it's 1157. This is the part of the show when we kind of shine the audience. You just find something to do out there. Okay. Appreciate a very much in there. A laugh. A scream. Yeah. Underground jingles. I think something like that. Anyway, the sub today, the steak cheese on an an outed tomato and other cheese. Well that's like that. That was it, Marlin. It is great. Yeah, that was Marlin Brando, Grepcing on a radio. You heard it first. Next it'll be on Murray Puppek, but you heard it first here. Oh boy. You were right about today. This is going to be a commissar. This is not just a lunch. I was saying that during the newsbreak. We get fed here every day, but we don't get fed just a good lunch. We get fed a gourmet spread every day. Every single day. It's something sensational. It's not for a crime. Shame's record. We could play it. We got our little 45 spindle on the turn table in there. We play 45s in there in there. Yeah. We can. Yes. Now that's unusual because most radio stations, they steal the spindles every day. They do. Production studio is there to use to drive me nuts. You have to run all around the building to try to find a spindle. I wish you could be here. I want to meet you. No, I'm here. It could be worn long. Remember you were in it. Say what? It's the best record they ever made next up on the roof. Remember you were in it Zayda one time when Neil was on vacation John and you had to like center the records because there was no spindle. Yeah, we were five. He's like centered them with his face. That was incredible. That's weird. Anyway, I got to do a little break while they're queuing up our exclusive crying shames record. That is? No. There's more coming. There's any way you could play may I. I'm not sure how she's listening because we don't have may I. We knew. Yeah, I hear we had none trouble finding the other one. Oh, yeah. I wouldn't find it. We had it. We'd play it. Maybe. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And the Johnny Darkset will bring you next time he's got it. We got it. Right. Yeah, I'm one of those rare individuals like you was a special. I really have to acknowledge those oldies. Yeah. Well, I'd call Ricky Tiki and maybe he'll put you on the ear. I listen to you. You know, you won't show over there. Listen, if you ever want to take my number, I'd be sure to help your radio station out. If you ever wanted to play more music. No thanks. Why do you pass me out? I don't know. I don't know what you're doing. I'm opening in Broward where I just hung up. Five to four. Wio. But he was right on the verge of your friend there. That was, you know, shmoring in on the show. I want to sit in, you know. You hit that. But we don't want your number. We're very pleased to talk to you and have a nice life and you really hit that off. Play with your records pal. Bang. Anyway, we would have played a crunch. He was he dubbing it? No. No. Boy, you know, we feed you like this. You think you can just sit around here and dilly, dally? Man. So we would have played. It could be word love by the crunch. Earlier, we're going to have to wait a few minutes. Because we got to dub it on a cart. Cause as John said, our record player is broken. How can it be broken? That's weird. Our turn table is under the weather. Huh. I understand that. Yeah. Is this a radio station or what? Turn table doesn't work. Hmm. Amazing. Speaking of sick. Here's Chuck E. I know Neil. Okay. Who the hell's Johnny Dawkins? He the guy was on that WKRP. Yeah. That's him. Back to the class. Yeah. I thought so. Anyway, Neil, the men suck. What is that? The men suck. I'm not good. But I have once some money on Chicago. So I'm not good. They're good luck to you. Anyway, that's all. I'm out of a tune. That's it. Turn up. Wow. Wow. Look at that. Two lines in Broward just went out when we put Chuck E on. Five two four Wiod. This, these wings with a blue cheese. This is, oh, man. Hmm. You've never, I swear to God, never take anything like this in my life. Hmm. Hmm. Are we the apologizing to those people who are out there listening, getting them? For real hungry. Yeah. I don't mean it, but I apologize. Boy, that is something else. Hmm. We can start eating on WLRN. Don't they already do that? I don't know. Yeah, but they eat with forks and knives like a bro. I very refined. I see. Of course, only very British things, you know, because it's a pure ingredient. Riviera Beach, hello. Yeah. Hi. Let me try to get it. Hello. Yeah. Listen, I didn't listen. You guys eat and first, first on the phone. The last 45 minutes. I wanted you to play rock lobster for me. Rock lobster. Yeah, about a B 52. Oh, yeah. Yeah. This is sure the show that plays that we sure all of that. Right under the table. That is? It's a good song. Yeah. Okay, no problem. Okay, now we're down to four calls. Boy, look at that. Well, I think they're all getting hungry and going out for lunch, maybe. She should have. Yeah, with these calls, it's really okay, you know. We don't care. Mm-hmm. Born. This blue cheese and these are the hot wings, too. They brought medium garlic wings and these hot or extra hot, just hot. Mm-hmm. Could be the best thing I've ever put in my mouth. Now, do you want to think about that? Yes, before you say that. I've been on to a Z. You're embellished lately. Okay, all right. How about that? How about that one? 1226 to WIOD and we have an open line in Broward. 5249463524 WIOD and also one in Palm Beach at 655WIOD. Boy, this is the, I haven't gotten any on me at all, right? But this is the sloppy as in job I'm reading every number, but it's just, you don't care. I didn't get any of those mushrooms. Are they all gone? I didn't either. I don't know. They're all gone? Somebody took all the stick and mushroom. They really cleaned us out. The beer battered mushrooms with a horseradish shawish. I think getting in here. They're all gone. We were caught. Oh, now let's not get carried away here folks. I think Mitch took all those mushrooms. I never, I never saw the box. Never even came close. There was a whole load of them. Oh, yeah. But I think they disappeared. Oh, are we, were we behind an abrake here? We're out. We my God. What's going on? You're just strapped. 27 past noon. We're like three minutes past on a break and I'm supposed to tell you that.
