here all and mid said why do we go across to e-lise and have dinner thread across from the hotel and it looks like a good place and we want up going instead of the palm which was tremendous at the normal anyway so i said oh that's funny you should mention e-lise because we talked about going there last night this is on the air and i said it's right across from our hotel oh now here is mr. Thompson who obviously has a full-rich life and does nothing but monitor these shows and conjure up all of these fantasies in his mind about everything that's going on everybody who visits my home and every move that we make which is none of his god-damn business and has nothing to do with anything that's on the air no can here are his notes okay phone calls two fifteen is your congle Avenue that was the address of this restaurant that somebody gave e-lise and here's the phone number hotels near e-lise so obviously call this phone number made up some story about probably needing to a meet people who i need to remember the hotel and what about hotels in the area near e-lise and here's the Drake the Barkley the tremont the white hall the raffie l and the rich Carlton and as it turned out we did stay at the rich Carlton it's got the phone number for the rich Carlton and evidently after he called the rich Carlton he was able to verify that neo-rodges or whoever else he asked for Disney were staying there underneath rich Carlton he's got 731 89 security in the name of an individual who works in security at the rich Carlton now what he told that individual only time will tell because we're investigating that even as I speak all right coincidentally enough and I just say this coincidentally I underline that in red the next day after mr. Thompson's frantic phone calls to Chicago to find out where we were staying which was none of his business and had nothing to do with anything that was on the air we nearly got killed in the reneccar which you heard that story I so sure everybody remembers that story now I'm not can necessarily connecting the two okay that would be reaching pretty far but it looks bad doesn't it doesn't it you see it looks bad when you keep sticking your tentacles and other people's business people assume that people start to assume things things together and when you there's one sheet in here and if the wish the audience could see this stack this is only a small portion of the ongoing memoirs all dealing with neo-rodges and w i and z and w i o d there's one several pages in which he's talking to the cdc which is the citizens for decency counselor waddy's ultra-rightwing groups and on one page it says cdc a favor of violence towards automates good lord and even after that particular date there's still our ongoing phone calls noted in his own this is kind of like a diary okay very illuminate let me just read you one of the phone calls with Dennis Collins November 10th 88 that's three days after we started here on w i o d 1150 a m tim Williams told Dennis Collins that gannett was talking with Disney through Williams to make sure Rogers didn't get into this history of given take ray his old station on w i o d my note to Dennis interesting that zata let him beat on me for 15 months but is now so very concerned about their rights not being beaten up by Rogers 117 88 that's the day we started on the air here yes Dennis Collins was talking to my machine from his car phone i have his voice on my tape during this call someone called me would say nothing but Rogers show was on in the background Dennis and i concluded the call and i replayed message it was an obscene message from one of Rogers listeners and Dennis and Dennis and Dennis is on here just repeatedly also remember the problems i had the original problems with my satellite dish when some crank called up the real estate woman who rented me my house and the through her got her told her that miss represented himself as being from the city of plantation and that my landlords had been fined retroactive $500 a day for the satellite dish which was a flagron line got my landlords crazy well here's another page all dealing with the zoning enforcement in plantation and with the aradjus satellite dish and with the name of the woman with mural inch realty who's the woman who handles my the rental of my house you think that's just another coincidence and at the bottom of this page here is a description which i won't read because it's nobody's business here's a description of the location and the structure of stand major's house what on the bottom of this page and here are pages and pages very clearly showing the surveillance and taking of license plate numbers and notes about harlan and bob and some of the other people from kuper city and stem and joe you know joe with eight ends and this one and that one this is a pattern this is like a book and it reads very clearly of someone who is committing the most heinous the most obnoxious and atrocious harassment who is out not only to get neorodges off the air but just to absolutely destroy my life to destroy anybody who stands in his path including Cox broadcasting guy gannet broadcasting anybody you name it and this is america this is this is a legitimate reason to get about a bit every morning to conduct hours and hours and hours of this kind of harassment this to tops and you ought to be ashamed of yourself i mean i knew because i've lived through it for over two years now we're in the third year this month of this ongoing hate campaign all in the name of religion again yeah i knew a lot of it but now having all of this in black and white this is this is incredible shocking sorry jay and i would i just wonder about the legal all these great illegal mines because i'm i might feeling about the law legal profession you know what i'm looking for now it's at the all-time low there's nobody other than our own attorneys nobody really seems to give it to him and you can do anything is an attorney of course here are these hundreds and hundreds of letters you remember american comedy network on the other station every song parody every one that we play there is a letter adhered to the record company of the original talking about the fact that we on zay they were playing this song parody and that american comedy network had recorded this without obtaining permission and rights etc etc now this is common practice in the industry it's on all over the country yeah but here again is this self appointed individual who's going to determine what we can do on the year what we can say on the year what you people can listen to and what the standards for the industry are all in his little ivory tower because he has nothing else to do 10 27 a w i o d here's another great page from this same bunch of crap okay i can find it the one that says April 1st Neil's house April well here it is Neil's house April 1st this is last year harlan and bobbed there tags and here we have the license plate numbers of these terrible criminal youth from mucopers city um with all sorts and then he's even got comments about harlan bad grades occurred in January blue hill dad is Joe spoke with the so-and-so on 731 88 he doesn't know harlan's last name but he was a senior and confirms the harlan went to Vegas harlan flunked and seems like a fruit it says well i hate to break the news to you jack but harlan is not as you would call it a fruit by any stretch of the imagination harlan is also far too ugly for anyone to be sexually interested but of course that's the overtone of everything everything comes back to sex everything we talk about and this man's mind has some kind of a sexual connotation everyone who visits my house is there for sexual purposes which is incredible because i'm not getting any of it but god only knows what happens when they leave the room but you talk about an over-immacted-overactive imagination and over-estimulated gland of some sort there or under-stimulated is the case may be an existing credible i should read the notes about the hollywood uh adult theater shouldn't i that that part is can i read that on the year no you're unfortunately no are you sure the last part i don't about the seats i don't think so oh you're here in some wild rumors jack i can't be the thing where he says they're seeming dripping from the seats i thought i've never seen that i better take my magnifying glass in that time yeah i'm already well that's the from the detective john Williams and hollywood of course gave him this real distorted bizarre story you know but uh that this honest goodness if we we ought to have a TV documentary and bring this all on the air and have in all of south florida really given this is one of the most bizarre and incredible stories this isn't just somebody uh you know doing a little nuisance thing or making a few calls to sponsors this is somebody who is just dedicated his entire existence to the destruction of another human being and the core obviously this radio show yeah uh ten thirty a w i do you look at that we got several calls on the board already this is a are you still there yes well how about that a mobile who hung on for dear life you believe it not really and nila hate to change the subject after all this stuff joc sounds like you really like you yeah he's a good buddy of mine that's an I was like calls me every day to see home feeling i was just a joke jack it's just a joke see we have to say that because he has no sense of humor so

but i didn't get a little sidetrack with these 40 billion pages of incredible material here which is only just a little tip of the iceberg oh seriously this pile i got here this isn't even 5 percent of all the rambling don't say pile that's a stack as they say in the pancake business this short stack that i have here we do have an opening in browner by the way where mr butel just hung up and he does do a good sunny fox it will be a lot yeah not too much else but he does do oh yeah he does one other very i never i never disliked him i never had any problem with him and his time goes on i begin to realize that a lot of the hostility for example Dennis Collins what are my favorite people it's so i'm 30 don't have a wild will be right back 1039 a wild in a very mysterious frying water just a whole bunch of things going on in the amazing part of it is other than fat rich nobody knows what they are isn't that incredible fat rich told me the exact date that buel's baby is going to be good and i said how do you know they said i know everything uh oh excuse me well that little hit us all it's delicious well i'm not great that public's left a little something so we could kind of cleanse our palettes to get started for the onslaught of food the rich came in for creatures looking pretty good there what is it about 100 pounds now yeah it looks like a 75 easy huh yeah almost 75 mm amazing what is that the weight you're going to put on today that you're talking about i'm going to have that uh radish there you know that i put up real nice you know how they have those utensils they're always peddling on a satellite on those stations where you cut the radishes in the watermelons well somebody had what i don't know anybody who's got one of those and somebody actually had one and they cut oh it's at public's well boy they sure know how to cut a radish over there that's beautiful it's almost a shame to eat it is beautiful you know the radish is a very good for as radishes go that are high and vitamin C by the way well those beautifully cut ones have ever seen I am I'm almost in tears it's just so emotionally okay come on we got an open line in brow or let's fill it up here let's get these lines really going like you people gave a damn about something i know you don't come six fillies to yesterday by the weight cartonals 13 to one loss to the meds what amontriolos 2 as now just for good measure boy we we are really doing it i'll tell you i want to be dealt with so happy he's a big cubs fan yeah he is since he was a baby he said did he say since he was a baby did he say that he said since Harry Kerry was knee-hide with grasshopper yeah Miami hello hi nail how you doing okay uh now that's sure I'm leaving worst Steve gonna get all this chronic from well i don't know what's going on i have no idea who it fact it's a good question you ask who's going to be the producer does anybody know there's a they're gonna replace her there's a thing well there's a they're looking for someone on the all i see well to board downstairs are you applying for the job sir well i don't know i don't know to maybe jack town to have a lot to the job then give you something to do and it would also keep in close to the station he doesn't have time oh yeah he's an unfortunately oh my god well maybe that signals a change in the um boy do i content boy do i have some bad news for you Johnny dark yeah all those tapes you got in your arm forget it you can't get in there go ahead very we got a collar on here and you're hobnobbing with his slieball Johnny dark you another wrinkle shirt on today back with i don't want to get two serious again but this this person you talk about jack is any of his harassment included anti uh feminism i don't know not that i know of okay because you could really nail him with that i mean that would be something there you could go he saves most of his energy for homophobia but uh if you cross your path even if you're a straight as the uh verizano straight's verineros bridge huh isn't it what they call it for his own approach it does make a difference in other words um if you just don't see things from the proper perspective you're uh bad guy well i hope you really uh hope they really put them away for uh for good and uh he stops the making your life well i'm let me ask you a question just not forgetting about him specifically but if you went out of trip to Chicago and it got on the air that you were at Chicago when you found out that that some snoop was making phone calls to restaurants and hotels and the security people and nosing around to find out where you were would you take kindly to that you think that's part of what uh you know writes to privacy in this country uh include i'd be slightly pissed yeah slightly pissed that's an excellent way to put it sir have a great weekend it's okay 1043 a w i a d and then we got these judges they well you know that's this is America if you want to drive around somebody's neighborhood there's not much we can do about it and if you want to uh you know snoop around it interfere with people's rights to privacy i say that's a crock of BS i say that some of our local a local judges here need a good uh a refresher course you know what i mean 1044 a w i a d Johnny of course who doesn't care about any of this is here to eat today he is here to just fill his fat face until he can't fill it anymore he even brought a gigantic shoehorn w i and d and serosos what's that is it a buddy bud shoehorn a mobile on eight hello hi on Neil this is Bob a satellite man uh first you're having a problem sound there with those Neil notchines in your development that won't let you have a dead he's sure it's true that sir there there's nobody in my development who gives a damn about my dish i have no problem with that the original interference on my satellite dish and i live in plantation and it's well documented on a sheet i have read in front of my nose the original interference was from someone who lives in coral gables who's been mentioned today oh okay because uh uh like that service to plantation area and i'm quite honest don't say it that way you're gonna be following say sir if you're nervous in your place well i know that i know that i'm working to choose from and right well let's can do your other commercial for satellite this next time sir 1045 a w i a d i mean i love my satellite dish but it's like not the end of the world you know what i mean hmm look at this page here here's the name of the woman again who's the real estate lady at Merrill Lynch who uh and the name of the man who lives at the end of my street who's the head of the what do they call that the um association yeah and i'm a district and the god's a mister and that's exactly it and then that description of stands house and we're like what what in the world business is it of this man where stand lives or what is happening what is that all about time is you're gonna do surveillance down there two stands not even on the air other than an occasional like yesterday once in a in a very blue moon i know talk about an obsession talk about just pathetic pathetic and then a cause there with Dennis Collins back and forth that's what i find most interesting in all of this i mean just numerous two numerous to mention and i i've only looked through a portion of this and there are thousands and thousands of pages in the other who might have even seen yet now i would Dennis be involved with someone of this ill-come and mic Thompson on the same station why would he be in whoa with this homophobic witch hot i just can't we do have an open line in brown or did five two four wio d and the pombies line is open again it's just like any other day and they don't care about any of this crap they want to know where the food is on the cane show today from two to four pms a killer two women whose problems with pre-menstrual syndrome nearly led them to murder plus doctor geobrown of the florida pms clinic and then from four to six marvin winestein with parents of murder children what so that sounds like a really uplifting in the week uh we've got what do we got we got hankin joe on sports talk i'm sure hankl tell you all about the fact that starting in the November issue of south photo magazine hank is gonna be a regular contributor for their new sports column and publisher Graham gloss isn't that a great name for a publisher of a glossy magazine Graham gloss says his name should be Graham schlock though we are pleased to have some of the hank's credentials to launch our sports coverage isn't that incredible huh says for the past 12 seasons goldburg is provided color commentary for the mommy dolphins radio broadcast he publishes a biweekly

show oh yeah like see it's good to have somebody who laughs in the background it just keeps their mouth shut I see anyway uh here's a couple of great letters in his packet of material which is now part of the public record February 13th 1988 a letter from John B. Thompson the Steve Kane a W. I.o.d. that's obviously long before we came over here Ray Neil Rogers. Dear Steve on December 4th 1987 and 7.16 a.m. Neil Rogers informed his listeners that you have exposed your genitals to your daughters in your home this reminds me of Flint's savaging a fall well governor yourself accordingly best February 13th same day busy day right reg. B.o.d.l.wl.v.e. Miami Ray Neil Rogers. Dear Greg at 7.04 a.m. on February 12 1988 Neil Rogers informed his listeners that you and Don Agony are homosexual lovers as he has in the past I have a recording of the defamation governor your son. John B. Thompson. I'm serious we're going to have a regular feature on this show let's get Mitch to get some nice violence amount of vawning music to play in the background and every day at a regular time to make sure nobody misses it will have a regular feature called the best of jack. Oh well we will read some of these classic stack of letters that'll carry us at least for two years before we get through this stack sounds to the miles if we can say that sounds good all right aren't these good ones yeah these are some of my favorite short ones these are very sure we don't have a lot of time there we have a lot of very heavy business to take care of like this call in Miami hello. Hi doing okay. Okay I got to pay I'm trying to stop you. No. Oh geez well that's it will give it a shot what is it sir. Bottled water by the way there's also a great note in there about a conversation with Nick that jack had to when before we came here and Nick was very upset that I was coming here and that we were going to do the disgusting trolling for boys on the year alleged etc. Very interesting conversation it go ahead sir. Let's go to the horse track. Yeah well after we eat. On the greatest cup. Go on. Readers cup yes. Right. I'm sending it to Peket. Yeah. You know the Prairie. Probably it's all sold out yeah you never going to hit. How long should it take me to get them back? Uh about next June I would you don't get a by next June I'd give a well 53 a WIOD we have an open line in date County where Mr Horst Joe's tongue up Mr Red 751 WIOD 751 by the way Mr Red governor yourself accordingly plantation hello. Yeah Neil. Yes sir. Hello there how are you doing? Great. Hello Glenn. Hey. Hey. Go on. Sir you going to trip any time in the air future? Any trip? Yeah. Because if you do we want to know what hotel you did. Well first let me say that Alex Bennett. Yes. On the roof. Oh we're getting to the real me to the matter that Alex. You know right today is the first day when I feel that the audience mostly has come back it's taken me a whole week to get the audience back after him. He blew 89% of this audience right out the window. Well we're glad you're back and I'm sorry the Glenn didn't get to do the show so Glenn take my vote for you next time. There you go. Now you know how much water that's going to hold around for you sir. For the next issue this the douchebag religious fanatic here. I think what you're doing today is great Hank is underwear out. Oh absolutely you've been doing he's been doing this in the dark for two years I should guess I shouldn't use that expression he's been doing this under cover. No that's not a good one. But I'm doing this like all by himself now that it also isn't a good one because I'm anyway I was going to say something about exposing it but I guess that wouldn't fit either. So you see you get boxed into a corner where no matter how you phrase it somebody can make it into something that it's not but the the bright floodlights are going to be on all these activities from here on in. But you know what this also makes me think about. Yes. Okay this this creep that's following you around about your sex class and all that. Who does that that doesn't remind you of these morons like Jim Baker and Jimmy Swag. Same same. Now my plan is it might cost you a little bit why don't you get yourself a private investigator and have this douchebag followed in every day and that's because I don't have any desire I don't care where he goes as long as he's not you know near me or any my friends. I don't care what he does just go live his life. I don't I don't have this voyeuristic desire to know what's going on with him. I've never been with near his house. I don't know where it is. I don't have any description of what it looks like and I don't care. I couldn't care less. Yes but if these judges aren't going to help you. Well we did we did get it. We did get another in junction yesterday and if he violates this one the judge has ordered that any municipal police like a plantation or Davy or whatever or the broad county sheriff are under instructions to arrest him if he violates this in junction and comes anywhere near me or my house. Yes. But you never know if you had someone following him. You might find him at the Hollywood movie theater. Well he seems to have a pretty all of that. I don't know. I've never seen any of these things there that he's writing about. But I guess I haven't been looking closely. Well that's what I mean. I'm going to have to start doing my own little investigation upclosure person. You know what I mean? No about all this stuff. Okay. Good point. Thank you sir. Hey take care. Okay. That is an excellent point. We're going to have to start investigating some of these things a little more closely and up personal. We do have some open lines on the board. I guess I shouldn't say that the audience has come back today. We have three open lines so it's not overwhelming. We're just waiting for a lot of good food to come in. I mean this stuff is going to go to waste which is a shame. No no Johnny's here. It's okay. No no seriously he's holding back. Don't you see he's not touching any of that. It's like that stuff looks real good but I want to wait for the good stuff because you know as wings plus this coming that better way out is coming. I would be surprised if pizza locks you as I mean I said that we want a real giant party of hopes who would make a cake do we have a sponsor? Oh I know who do you know that she's cake lady? Oh yeah but it may be too late. Yeah that's way up and brown. Somebody will come up with some kind of like a birthday not a birthday but a going away cake same good luck based a luck sharing etc because this is Sharon's last day. Oh no boy she luckier why? Oh you talk about jumping off just at the right time you know. Now you didn't find any letters in that mountain of paper to Phoebe in there did you? Okay let me know if you want to cross anything. I'll tell you there's there's an interesting page here where it talks about Bob and Allen and STEM and now and I said to somebody the other day you know if my sex life were really centered around all the here it is right here you have Bob Allen and Andrew and I thought to myself I thought about that for a while I said that sounds fine to me. I'll never leave the house unfortunately not of it is true but boy I know what is that like alternating days like on Monday it talk about Fantasia talk about just sitting out there in the oh and there's one when we were at INZ I got to find this during the break and he's written down the license plate numbers and he's he's convinced himself and Capri de Drove a black must thing where he never did. Ricky's got all the cars out in the lot of sign to a different person. I leave the building at 10 19 that morning and then in the next space he's got written down 10 46 AM Rogers arrives home at such and such a graphic plantation so obviously he followed me home on that day and maybe many others. Ah isn't that fabulous but it's America so you can just run around conducting your own little subversive surveillance and harassing people and which has a lot to do with what's on the year it doesn't it? So in other words if I meet somebody through the show and they want to being a friend of mine or come into my house then that proves I'm trolling for something on here didn't stand meet his wife Lori through the show I think so didn't I meet big Dave who lives with me but definitely on the other side of the house through the show also yeah and also Steve O. Met Lori all be damn on their member at a we've heard you're checking into a lot of this and following a lot of people pretty sure we got Henry Burrow standing by don't follow Henry because we all know where he goes so basically the same Henry's got the 11 o'clock news we'll come back at 11 o'clock 5 with our number 2 as the goodbye Sharon party continues. Look at that there's smag she never looked better did she look at that on a Joey Reddle show that said wag your little tail there's smag and she cute well I don't want to hear about that. Look at that where's oh there's Joey now who's that that he's got as that sunny bono? I don't know what you're laughing about that guy on the left there looks just like sunny bono didn't they? He looks like a cross between oh I don't know who that is. Look at that he's got the boy Gary's old suspenders who is that guy huh? Anyway we want to remind you that smag green is going to be on a Joey Reddle show today got only knows why what what would prompt him to do that? I can't believe she's just not a man. I should you I'll know you're right she isn't heavy demand kind of like WLS 1106 to WIO D it's our number two on a Friday it's Sharon's party we don't have anything here for it yet but we're well we do have the stuff left over from public thank god for that wouldn't it be embarrassing if we didn't even have that because Rich and Johnny darker both got the whimsical looks on her face where's this giant spread we're expecting well it's a little bitterly okay. Why you talk about really sick I think Jack needs to investigate Johnny dark my saw right at us just a joke John just a little joke North Miami hello yeah I don't great I just want to call my cousin Tony Dispanking you are a bag okay kind of has a little meter there little why I'm at you we have an open day at 751 WIO D 751 9463 I can't wait for the commercial break to get over with there so we can get to the important part of the Joey Reynolds show today yeah now we're probably be really hard pressed for calls this hour be it's now what is it you're doing you're not turning the sound up are you no no no no no turn it down we we're not going to start we broadcasting channel 10 on the year okay it's bad it's hard enough to watch it we don't want to listen to it West Palm Beach hello yes sir I just here to prove that people up here do care I've been here about what you said people up here don't care and I've been holding for quite some time because I do care I want to speak to you in Glenn have you seen the Joey Reynolds show sir on TV trust well oh there's magic she really looks great that she has mega you do it go ahead sir it means nothing do you want to give this right that's absolutely right but that's it's a good sign a couple things number one as far as you're this individual in coral gables you mentioned something earlier that there's a campaign have been stepped up after you it cow cow to him and take in certain things no no wait wait wait I didn't call you to take any space there you go okay well I think that just proves it's like you're dealing with little children when you give them reinforcement they keep doing what they're doing I don't think in this case I don't think it makes any difference I mean this individual is so obsessed and so driven by this I mean doesn't have any other purpose for getting up in the morning I mean this is all he does sure all you don't you don't you think if they give him encouragement well it doesn't it he'll just do it even more it doesn't help that's for sure but I'd like to know can you enlighten me is to what where we stayed in Chicago what that has to do with what's on the air and cleaning up the air where's could you tell me what that has to do with anything but if you can prepare better yet the all that's I've been listening to if you can prove that he was the guy that was making misrepresentations regarding your satellite did well it's all right there in the telephone records because the real state of he lives in Broward he lives in date I've already threw through various stuff that's been slipped under my door anonymously I've already seen certain telephone records which are incredibly incriminating and you know you just put all this together and it's right there in black and white well as you have if you as you have said there's a lot of things that are immoral and he shouldn't be doing but that legally nobody's gonna even slap his hand for but what you've described as far as if you can prove he was doing that with a about the satellite dish and impersonating these other people and trying to get it taken out I think you're going to nail him on intentional inflation of emotional distress if that I hope that's one of the counts in your losses and you get in a bandages and get into his financial records now you don't get anything this man guy he has got two nickels to rub together in his name he's got everything in his wife's name so it's you know it's just an exercise sure well all lighter note I listened a little bit to Bill Calder this morning and he told a caller who didn't know his name he was trying to give her t-shirt said well do you know what my name is and she did and he said well it's Glenn Hill he sure asked for Glenn Hill he did yep don't get him started again I thought it was kind of cute it was yeah oh even you thought it was cute well the bill call there's talking about me yeah I think what you want to hear what he says about you now he was he was he was being just being currently in funny yeah that's Bill it was fun listen I enjoy your show and tell your station manager whoever to the show is good now but it was better the first month or two when you first came well no question about that but then they start taking all you know everything away and getting a well he's busy changing underwear right now but as soon as he finishes all past events have a great weekend thank you bye bye be a little bit we've got a card for everything in here what Lori major now that has to be a mistake is it hello yeah hi how you doing okay it's not a mistake but I just had to say something first I'm so glad you're able to talk about all this stuff well I'm sure interested to see this nice description of your house it's very accurate that's what I'm calling about I was floored when Stan told me last night but I want your listeners better govern yourself accordingly Lori absolutely what I want your listeners to understand one thing which is really interesting to the extent that this man goes to all right that first of all Dan did not start living here until after he and I were married which was March of 88 and okay I'll give you the date of this it's June 7th 88 okay and then he was shortly off the air after that right this house is in my name and it's not like you're here all the time you know you're welcome here all the time you know that but it's not like you're here every day I never ever there I don't think of it here house twice yeah you've been here a couple of times and you know we've been over there a couple of times and Stan goes over very infrequently with no pattern or anything else and that's what I mean it just like really got into my gut last night I mean what an invasion it really it like just like that guy and you're got how about this thing about Chicago where we nearly got killed and here's the evidence in this man's handwriting of these phone calls and the hotel we were staying at and he calls the overnight late night security guy and got only knows and we're we're investigating it all of that right now but what in the world does this have to do with anything other what's we go out of town and it's his business where we're staying? No I mean that is just amazing it is just absolutely incredible I mean it's the public it's just beginning to get an inkling of the kind of invasive kind of thing that's been going on here for two years where you practically don't you can't even leave the house? Absolutely and to know where where my house is I mean that's that was just like I said that's a steal I thought this house is in my name I mean it's not like you can go look in public records and find that's this is Stan Nature's house that's what's real? Well you got to understand most of this doesn't have to do with public records it has to do with following people that's what it has to do and and license tags yeah well that's you know that's interesting enough in itself yeah how some but just a private person can start pulling all that kind of information well when you don't have anything else to do when it's a 20 hour a day occupation I guess you have plenty of time to do these things and of course I'm fascinated by this long list back and forth of telephone conversations with Dennis Collins from WNWNWN which I find very very embarrassing for them over there. Remember the lunch? Yes I do and the pumping session about you? Well I'll put it in the pretense of a job yeah uh information gathering session that's it well nice work Dennis you can't beat me on a year and a rating so you have to try to give me out of the market nice work and credible okay one thing Dennis Collins is no J are you and because he would have never gotten caught in something like this that's for sure take care of Neil covering yourself according I absolutely well bye bye 1118 at Wiod we have an open line in day 751 Wiod and a line in Broward at 524 9463 524 Wiod we're just sitting here very casually awaiting the arrival look at that smeg is still on there boy this is and look at this who's who's first through the door with the Arnold family from Arnold's Royal Castle ladies and gentlemen with big smiles on their faces with rings on their nose and bells on their toe here they are right from Royal Castle that's great well it's a be a good little appetizer for you John get to start and cleanse your pal a little bit what's in the back oh my god now I want to tell you something Spencer said he was coming next week and bringing me cigars but you remember the last cigars you brought me I ran I spoke to all and I don't have one cigar in house and I was just in need of cigars and look at that isn't that incredible is incredible making that the oh I don't want these okay what a guy thank you way and that's great what is this picture oh it's about those nilly burgers that they got at Arnold's that's the sign in the window there's a little picture for those that don't believe it and even a little a little lighter I'll be damned well how does that work I'm not too familiar with that kind of stuff like a pen I'll be dead I'll don't waste all my fluid thank you thank you very much that's nice isn't it boy but you could do a lot of interesting things with that anyway it's 20 past 11 if you're a little commotion in the background it's because the first wave of food is coming out we should get Sharon in here for some of this because it's her party shouldn't we feed her it wouldn't that be the appropriate thing to do well I would think wouldn't that be the gentile thing gentile thing yeah gentile anyway it's 20 after the hour we're gonna kind of get this all rain Johnny over there is just starving by the way you can a little something to keep him from being so a little fat ridders one box for Johnny and fat ridds those nilly burgers anyway can I talk about wings plus while we're talking about that's not fair I just took a bite of this little bacon and nilly burger you know and he starts playing that jingle that's disgusting Nick well we won't have Nick to kick around anymore starting on Monday according to the rumor line that's what fat rich told us may isn't and the bird said fat rich is alive I'm sure I should believe there's a mobile and broward but they're gone right nope don't hear how you're doing what are you now this is a loyal listener you've been hanging on for a long time spending big bucks yeah well having important things I heard the governors in town and I'm real with this time caller by the way long time listener and if the governor does call you today I want you to do two things want tell them about this loan it's like down and call springs maybe you can extra bite them out of the state but when you're done your conversation make sure you tell them the governor self-courtingly okay okay hmm look at taking cross springs 26 past 11 at Wiod here's a little note says norm says good things are happening don't mention it on the ear oh we have an open line in rouse for five two four Wiod oh good things are happening with my satellite oh isn't that great well yeah things the warmest starting to turn these last couple of days dramatically oh good what's good I guess they got all the papers in and we're on the agenda and I'm going to get my permit I won't have to unplug my dish today after baseball season and of course I may want to of course their fabric is kind of smugging complacent here today because he knows the cups are starting Paul Kilgis this afternoon against the cardinals which is an act of fear insanity but you know we'd like to make it close now that we're game in a half again we'd like to make it a little bit close give the cardinals a fighting chance and of course they're not staring anybody only may grain today so no big deal who are the mess playing tidewater oh the pirates bought pirates you know and it reminds me about that three game sweep in New York the last time the two teams met boy that was I guess a bad stroke a luck by the met they should have probably saved some of those runs from yesterday I bet you David Johnson and I will be thinking boy when we lose four to three in tennings we should have saved a couple of those runs Atlanta is this a joke hello yeah hey you yeah are you really in Atlanta is this a put on where I swear I am well you'll be if you stay there long enough you'll be sworn for a long time I'll tell you that I'm here with all the fakers you know a lot of fakers you're in Atlanta a lot of shakers fakers shakers and quakers yeah not real people but burger you there yeah I'm concerned about something it's really bothering me really bird bashing I don't like it now you're behind the times now now everybody loves the bird we've gotten that out of our system he had a great call from Greg butel today people that love 94 want to kiss and make up they love them it's true it's true really yeah it seems to have all blown over dissipated yeah dissipated that's the word you feel better now oh I'm sorry we now can go about my thing yeah they called me for a long time for an offered an olive branch of peace to me today which done on here they did this yeah wait wait man Steve King has an announcement to make at the beginning of a show now what does that mean uh oh always been a one out she's not coming in by the way Neil yeah on last night on TBS I've seen Alex have done it on a

weekend up there in a land of you know and if you're from out of town see one thing about they're not into race anymore they don't care about that it just you can be white black or purple but if they don't like the way you look they might just pick on you you know what I mean well I don't know I think they might have you over for dinner so to speak yeah right I'm I'm I'm a standout in the crowd or something every time someone sees me they think they say oh you must be from out of town yeah it's probably that's pretty you've been wearing you know I would probably change my wardrobe a little bit

will tell you this Bob Martinez has done so much for racing that you could tell why we're on death story yeah well he's certainly an expert he knows a lot about him you know he knows about it much about racing as he does about running the state by the way listen I hate to keep it a rup thing but an old friend of yours called and left a message just before you punch them you wouldn't believe me you want to hear it yeah let me just it out yeah yeah what a guy how did you guys maybe now I call because I got up to my office I turned on the radio and I heard you saying to Glenn of Phil has been

he said if you got anything today and we hadn't had time to look at the entries and I said I'll tell you what we've never done this before but we'll put Phil on his spot and he'll surely be listening

problems when you call it I mean God and I was nice enough to stay on but that was an important call it wasn't it it was very important so it was counting on the air tricky learn from his old friend Hank Goldberg yeah well you know I just call to give you a few of those things that went on and just say hi and say it I'm still alive also in other words you were done anyway oh well actually I was just saying you know hey I'm still alive I'm still listening you guys great so I'll be talking to you next my mind my mind from hook is with you real good data calling all right take it easy okay bye well wasn't that great he didn't overdo the welcome today I guess he understands he knows the lay of the land anyway in the noon to one hour we're gonna be reading about 300 letters from Jack's collection here haha letters to everybody in the business several letters to Dennis Collins and I find it fascinating by the way we're not gonna be reading letters today Jack's just chill out but no most of the letters he signs JB Thompson yeah with that very distinct handwriting the letters he writes to Dennis Collins he signs Jack really like their realdy friend yeah well I guess it coincides with all those phone calls going back and forth to help you I guess the philosophy of W snooze we can't beat him so let's get him off the air that's the Dennis Collins philosophy at WOLD see if our general manager of a station to market and word got out that I was consorting or communicating on a fairly regular basis back and forth with somebody of this ill could be embarrassed humiliated and degraded I couldn't even face the employees I'd probably go into the closet so to speak and shut the door never come out again you know what I mean Dennis kind of it's I was gonna say it's kind of embarrassing but when you use to the books that they get the embarrassment factor has to be so great before it starts sinking in you know doesn't make any difference you know but I do like their demographics and we're gonna be all getting our polo then out after the newscast just in honor of them Chuck Myers got the one at the one o'clock news but he's gonna bring it to you good noon and then we'll come back at twelve o'clock all right you know it's great but enough it's about twelve o'clock seven at WOLD look at that phone boy they sure drop off during that new news don't they they really just go nuts well it's about something exciting okay can we can we tell us now yeah don't tell what although Steve has some we all have two doodies got some very exciting positive news thank goodness it to a clock great to think happened and then you'll understand why he's been like kind of eating out the last couple of days but um as it always does in the end Jack justice prevail you know saying so govern yourself accordingly Dennis and Jack and Mike and all our good friends out there in radio land oh no did you are you are busy so you didn't hear about the letter uh well not a letter about this page about when we were in Chicago that weekend and it has well it's interesting because here's Eli's not mentioned people were calling in the way I did that show and they were saying hey you got eat at this place you got eat here Eli's was a very great stay-couse which we didn't get to but the day I did the show listen to this very important day I did the show somebody called and said you got to try Eli's and I said oh that's right across from our hotel well our friend our dear friend Jack got Eli's number and then got a list of all the hotels that are in the area right there by Eli's and it's sure enough here is the Ritz Carlton hotel which is where we were staying and then called this individual whose name is here in security and wouldn't you know just by coincidence it again I'm not suggesting anything I'm just saying in bizarre coincidence the next day we had that episode and he really got killed in our rent a car so you see when you keep and of course this has a lot to do with what's on the year on this day that where we were staying in Chicago and nosing around and playing sure a lot comes this has nothing to do with anything and certainly not a his business or anyone else is but when you start messing around and I've been that of course something happens then people are going to put uh two and two together and start assuming things you don't know me so I think perhaps our friend is just overstepping his bounds to the point where uh who knows what's going on not of course to mention all these contacts with Dennis huh well that's another thing yeah but I guess we better all govern ourselves accordingly we do have some open lines on the board now what in Broward at five two four wiod and Boko and Palm Beach are as dead as the proverbial dornale yeah we need in three days fine good now he's got his healthy appetite back everything worked on he's nothing after a great meal like a great judge or a good norm just sick with norm can I'm telling you if you would just listen to his radio show you'd you'd pick it up just from that show that hit that that show is so brilliant you can you can perceive that anything you hand over to him you'll handle with brilliance and a plum you talk about all that talent under one yeah all the three there we were in at courthouse and there were the three greatest talk host in a history abroad casting all in one building at the same time pinna yorajers Steve Kane and Norman Elliott it was shocking really was thank they brought an extra security because they thought that you would never be the same um happened in between all of us we had oh my god that's right five hundred thousand listeners and two and Norm said not got at least three or four that's my friend listen and I said nor my no you don't have any friends so cut the crap anyway 12 13 a wiod and the steve does eating like like he never saw food before he says for seven three days he said goodness for that hmm by the way possibilities is bringing in tons of food to our remote it specs this Wednesday it says for which is gritting from earlobe to earlobe they'll have loads of sampler items pastas pasta salads and everything that's ever been invented okay so that's solomer reason I know is that for the crowd or is that just for that right you'll have to combine find out for yourselves and deons gonna be there too I know we'll feed deon my amy hello neo yeah speaking of cheap cigars and bad radio I'm glad Steve is there I was listening yesterday turn on my car radio and afternoon and they're staying right now you're gonna not start ripping stuff right no no I realize the show was in much but you're not gonna start ripping a more no no that's not what was over the house last night and I promised him his birthday is the tomorrow I'm gonna take him to dinner and that's not why I'm calling he invited me to take him to dinner I didn't say it wasn't mine no no honestly I'm not calling to rip them but the thing that is amazing how did all the juniors know since it wasn't advertised every juniors in the world that ever called him called yet that's the junior computer pipelines here they have they have called computer thing a chip that they put in their computers and as anytime stand is on here anywhere that immediately a send a heart it's amazing and the world the one thing I do want a little spyre for he did go through the garbage yesterday and found that article about the Chicago AM station that's going to yeah I threw that he mentioned to me last night that he saw and I thought to my so she I threw that in the waste basket how to so he was so desperate he was digging in the garbage well but I wanted to say he what his comment was that how that station went and hired every single nobody and lousy prop show host in the country yeah and if you're listening not everyone oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh and that's I'm believing me I'm not that's no put down or nothing I'll be home if you're not. Anyway listen the best of those traits that you've got to start doing it immediately of those letters I would just start going you'll read those letters he got to do it. Okay well listen I only have enough here to last till two years from Zucker so i'll see what we can do it one thing though how we mire and Andy are all knickered and this is the rand they we can call people knickered okay and govern yourself accordingly. Bye. What? What reading a lot of the stuff this is all public uh stuff now because it's public record well I read the one that he wrote to you you didn't hear that what did I do that? No no this was about but I said something about you shoured uh uh daughters or something. He spoke here's the one to Greg but you do and here's a phone call to Dennis Collins 11-1088 uh there's also a little you know he's got these little notes in here and one of the notes that he couldn't sleep on November second because he was worried about what I would say on your show remember I came on your show before I started working here and here's a little note remember a Joe with three ends our friend Joe out there who's a by the way Jack Joe is like 22 years old okay I guess that's still not over how old does somebody have to be before they can come in a studio I mean I'm not saying that old enough to do something with them because that has to be over 80 I already know that Jack all right but I mean just to look at him and talk about they got to be like 40 50 you know what I'm interested in why is he talking to my old boss Dennis Collins from WOLD I don't know but there's you're a lot of the conversations back and forth and there are letters and there is a relationship here well for example November 7th 88 which is today I started on WIOD it says Dennis Collins was talking to my machine from his car phone and goes on I mentioned that earlier but it certainly bears mentioning again because there seems to be this somewhat insistuous relationship between and then here Neal's home April 1st Harlan and Bob were there Jack was busy outside surveying tag information request what you were in court yesterday you heard about these about this police investigation that Jack was conducting even though of course he's not a member of law enforcement but it's fascinating but the best one of all that was about the Hollywood movie theater though no that's fine you know that's my figure to copy from norm of a lettery sent talking about how he had written Janet Reno oh yeah for relief okay and norm pointed out to him you know it's interesting that you would expect relief from a lady who you falsely accused of being a lesbian during the Jack's say that in your court oh my god anyway March 14th 89 detective Murray you remember that thing that was we'd the fact to normal here on the show we talked about that Hollywood that terrible dirty theater with all those movies that you would be going back with how didn't do that well nobody talked he did talk to detective Murray of course from the Hollywood police the vice-pig and it says Hollywood Rogers is known at theater for trying to pick up guys in theater and bathroom oh my god now I must say that's a that's a technique I've never learned yet all certainly I'll think about why the jack has been surveying it well listen and then it says semen drips down theater seats and was when Murray was there now why she's been doing a close-up I'm close and personal I mean even Murray safer would do investigative reporting like that we want to say about Jackie's thorough well I don't know that's the word incredible anyway it's about nice team W whatever it is and well listen I'm going to give you my temporary this weekend I'm going to keywest and there's this gay uh bar there they got this gigantic restroom okay it's incredible it's the size of Mount Rushmore can you give the phone number for a drink well no no matter fact I found that somebody's phone number on the wall there was a embarrassing coconut creek hello hello yes deal I called you today well listen that's something amazing I could dial up past but anyway I'd left out something I was going to call one of my friends which is a quaint for yours Rodney's listening and packing up his voice right now Rodney's an idiot sir Rodney is an idiot well that's an understatement of course correct but I'd like to call him and a couple other outwriters do spag of the most severe time okay and he'll let's a new movie coming out do spags of the third kind and he is also a unique kind of guy really well sounds like we got more investigating going on boy a lot of investigators in the town you all better govern yourselves and that's it okay thank you so much uh I can't believe Phil had a line today can you believe that there's I never heard Phil Salt's McRacker really hysterical I but that was pretty good he said that the governor martin is not only looks like Bella LaGosci but he has something else in common they both suck which I thought was excellent anyway we got the cigars here and everybody's in a good mood and Steve is chain eating here like oh and I got another cigar that's right from Steve well this is just a little one well I don't mean that literally but anyway we want to uh I gotta find that letter that he wrote to you on February the eighth February 13 1988 Visi Day Visi Day was writing a Gregory Benson also I can't find it but I'll find him over the weekend I'll read dig through here and put him in order there's some letters to Rick Shaw and there's one where he can fuse as he thinks Rick Shaw is the Rick of Rick and Spud and he says that dear Mr Shaw I'm paraphrasing that guy I have to excuse me but I can't find it right at the moment he says Rodgers this morning said that you and Spud's are homosexual lovers and etc etc not Ricky ticking you dummy come on Jack you gotta get your Rick right you know what I'm saying he's got all his Rick's confused 21 past noon at Wiodito a year ago you've been the stack of paper it's like swamped you February 13th 1988 boy that said same day he was a busy jail on that day what he made a busy camp a Motown record corporation Hollywood California Ray the temptations dear Motown and this is for all the listeners who were you know wondering why they couldn't hear that stand major theme so that was the best thing Jay Michaels ever didn't his lie on I see yeah it's common practice in the industry to do song parodies nobody gives it to him you know dear Motown not dear anybody a particular but dear Motown guy again at publishing company of Portland Mainlands two radio stations in Miami WI and Zayda these two stations have been played my girl originally sung by the temptations are written by Smokey Robinson but set the different lyrics the new song is used as a theme song for Stan Major a talk show host on WI and Z I doubt Motown is authorized alteration of lyrics of this great hit I had tapes of this song is played on the air I strongly suggest you contact me before relying upon any insurance is that their lawyer or his clients might give you sincerely that is another great letter about to George Steinbrenner at the end he says PS I wish the Yankees best of luck in their penance stretch drive this year I guess it didn't help last year it seems to me they didn't quite make it to them but I don't know how jack has time to see any games well no he didn't he just wish him luck just to kind of oh add a little a syrup to the ointment there okay we got a lot of open lines here folks this is your last chance it's either either you call in now or we're gonna eat celery on the air for last hour and a half okay that's your choice what is that oh from 2 to 6 p.m all the parents of murder children's been postponed until Monday okay well we didn't want to get you 2d pressed for over the weekend so we're saving that one for Monday on Steve show and then today pms a killer two women whose problems with pre-manstrual syndrome nearly led them to murder plus Dr. Gail Browna the Florida pms clinic and Alice on Monday morning when he returns for vacation is got bms which is another subplot of syndrome that his audience can relate to okay let's go to for a lot of day hello hello Neil yes sir I'm thinking after hearing his things about your friend jacket maybe he's just going out of his way to cover up his own little problems by picking on you you don't think so do you think he's got problems I think he probably acquired a closet clean and it's probably going out of his way to prove just how my two is by picking on you or maybe it's the duty for us syndrome maybe you should start watching over your shoulder maybe he's gonna come to your house some night and then it'll well he comes to my house the judge said yesterday that he's gonna get his answer rested so I don't think he ought to come anywhere near my house well let's hope he does because he needs to be resting he needs to put away well he needs to have some airing out I'll tell you that he's a long rest somewhere absolutely true okay sir thank you go bring yourself you know it's an interesting question as Jack records and listen to this do you think as these things you don't know what they hear today do well monitor what can I ask you this yeah what else would he do but he's got a lot of course bonnets to catch you but do you think as he listens to these you know these factual things he's written come out over there do you think he is embarrassed by that now now he's outraged because he you know he just as sure as could be that we're twisting and distorting and of course he shot it would be an expert at twisting of his sorting because that's what he does to everything that I see on the air he's been doing it for over two years now but the bloom is off the roads as Steve would say and Jack you're just gonna have to get used to it because this is only the beginning we're gonna discuss in any damn time we feel like it and all of this stuff is a matter of public record we're gonna get some good uh holly rid strings music to play in the background is every day we'll have the best of Jack and read some of these letters on the air I should I think it makes great radio there are some of these are just incredible as good as eating almost not it's pretty bad radio oh man some of these take a while too it'll kill some good time we won't have to worry about these stinking phone calls here's a mobile on the palm beach line hello hey how you doing today great good lunch y'all yeah excellent lunches today but you go to finger lake yes i did matter fact they still had those same cripple horses running it was great are you still there yeah they're all there you go the traffic all you have no yeah I went to the table you down's they're all still there too David Vance and um all those people Robbie rankin the whole bunch they're still up there in the table yeah I got the daily news last week and I'm looking at the results from the i-crues and there's maclopel i thought he was a stud well he was for a while in Europe and then they brought him back to racing again I I wish they would have retired him because I think I think they're really pushing their luck at this point he has nothing left to prove but uh they're still racing him he well it's a trial it was like 250 thousand dollar trial it uh all right you even get down to know which to know which where the hell is that I know I thought you knew all the cities in the yard I never heard a knower witch down towards singleton Hamilton Earlville no I mean I know Binghamton and I know Ithaca but that's southern tier down there that's kind of like foreign country to me I don't know too much I know more like lack of onea and Batavia and Leroy and Tonawanda no not polcano Montenau no see that's not upstate New York that's done by the New York almost uh that's in a cat's gills that's we go us we go on the onter verona Cooper down yeah well listen have a great day sir because I'm about ready to go into a coma 29 past noon sound like it was gonna break into a course of the Jewish polcanoes there for a second isn't it I was just he'd done reciting he's done names got it baby you got it I think about that card I like the best is that it's so muffled you know I know it's perfect so it would fit on almost any station in the market like if you heard it on WOLD with that muddy sound of there's it would fit right in with no problem okay open line in bokeh 2789463 and one in Palm Beach at 655 Wild where Lee Fowler is really setting that town on fire isn't he he's kind of like Mrs. Murphy's cow or whatever that was here's a mobile and date county hello hey Nick I don't okay Joe hey listen I have a question I know I'm so I don't see him in the phone book anywhere what do you want sir does he exist yes well I was looking why would you be looking why would you be looking in the phone book well I needed to find out whether the guy existed yeah he exists sir but I'm afraid you don't we have an open line in date county 751 9463 751 Wild my amy hello hello uh Neil did you mention who is uh the the guest on the all-through of the show today the Ellis Rubin show yes who is it why don't know I just wondering oh man we got a bunch of pinnacle and what happened we were going along just fine we finished lunch I think was our mistake and all these would be comedians are calling it auditioning now okay it's like the Ted Mac amateur hour or made your bows Johnny's old enough to remain your bows here's a mobile and bokeh hello actually it's a model cable well thank God for that absolutely I never would have watched where you're driving down there now you know I'm taking my license plate so if I don't want to be monitored exactly I mean he may find out that I'm the Duke you know my God you know what I'm saying you better give us that license plate number so we can check it out okay I just never knew that there was a place in uh upstate in the York called O'Neill yeah I'm on the end of the year oh fuck what you got fact the fact rich is from there I just think that you know maybe like an early end uh O'Neill about a year up at an hour and a half baby a day would be perfect for the jack the jack chronicles how about that Neil well if we could get it in an hour and a half well we'll do our best this is the most entertaining I've heard not that you're not always entertaining Neil but you know I'll tell you once we get into some of these letters boy how do you talk about entertaining talk about a live at imagination may just it'll just uh open up new horizons for you well this is uh definitely plays into the heart of most people today with the new TV uh scambleshows that they have now you doing it on radio for us it's wonderful yeah yeah yeah yeah what do you think about that Dennis Collins the WNWS what do you think he's gonna have to say for himself what do we take his deposition in a few days uh uh me too are you gonna serve lunch I'll come too yeah we got something special we're gonna serve Dennis pot in the expression yeah all right okay see in O'Neill the Enta well don't forget to be true to your shoulders we get Neil okay bye bye bye well a little a hyper there wasn't it's a different 1232 a WIO day you're not suggesting there's more than 102 or contacts with Dennis Collins numerous two numerous to mention one or two hundred and that's only in this stack I haven't gotten to the other 45 billion pages in the other room there yeah what would I want like a conspiracy but I will I didn't say that see now I think you ought to just kind of remove yourself from all of this and just to the question I don't I have no I would never a lead such a thing because I don't want on I don't think that Dennis as desperate as his ratings are and as geriatric as his demographics are and his tenuous as his job probably is with Jefferson pilot I don't imagine that Dennis would ever stoop to such a level because the things that I hear about him would indicate to he might well that's why you see I would never say anything like that because what I've learned on the air is our job is to ask questions we're not here to get a question jump to conclusions like jack does and try to put two and two together and get 87 we're here to try to probe what's going on out there and radio a lot of things you try to hold it in your mind what parole can't say you know I'm trying to think of another alternate term there aren't any either several came to mind but also in the same category could easily be misunderstood by else likes up at the FCC and washing in and all these other great bureaucrats who are listening very very carefully to see who's not in is then of course we know that there are a lot of great liberals like Jesse Helms people of this ill who are really very concerned that they want to keep everything in fact we could play ticker belt every day for 24 hours and probably still be in a certain degree of trombone absolutely thank you bell well you know what that take her I understand I know it's terrible it was terrible take her bells affair to begin with that's correct well I guess Rick and Spuds are out of the closet after 1234 at WI O Day we do have an opening in Bokeh man Nick is doing a hell of a business on that bet line today I got news for you he is taking orders so fast 2789463 is that Bokeh number we desperately want to hear from Bokeh and Del Rey because oh look at that is this the men's tennis oh that was Martin I'm sorry 37 at WI O Day we have an open line in the Palm Beach I feel like I've said that so many times this since I came back and of course Harvey Bennett what was his name Alex Marshall Alex Bennett Alex Trebek who did that show it's gonna take me a good two weeks to get the audience back no you think I'm joking I'm serious it's gonna take me two solid weeks to get the whole audience back it's improving as each day goes by but he must have blown a good 90% of the audience right out the window he was great wasn't it I'm sorry to tell you going vacation now about 80% what are you saying when he doesn't it's about 80% what happens when I go on but no I don't mean I didn't know what no no yeah well he doesn't want to go away he said I didn't you took it wrong you're paranoid oh I took it wrong now what I what I what I meant now what I meant can I tell you what I know you take it wrong yeah I know what I would know well let me tell you what I meant all right no what I meant was that I meant to imply that every time I go on vacation and you know that guess how I said it and that takes me like a week to get everybody back was what I meant I didn't mean you well I never said it for me I was talking about my my own yourself yeah say that what about I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I yesterday well we'll find out today if anyone's left because Dan is already I am so grateful I am so grateful for staying sitting in I could kiss him I mean I was in desperate yes well we could arrange that I think we get a couple of letters on that yeah a few no I'm at have another stack up to the ceiling in the okay now do you hear that Jack a Steve wants to kiss Dan what a he can stand is going to kiss him on the rows okay let's get well this ought to be good for another 20 or 30 letters of the busy we get that what are they call that the word generator what are they call that they word processor boy I bet the thing is just turning it out here the sounds right now you go to the cables you can hear it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay while he was nervous he thought if he got on the air here he'd have his license plate taken down he got nervous and chickened out dear field yeah crack what if he's what if he's what if he's what if he's what if he's what he was what if he was what if he was what if he was what if he was what if he was what if he was oh I was we have an open line in brown five two four w i was a yeah he's my favorite he calls it all the different lines now he just he gets around like the beach boys he gets around let's see what are we going to do Miami hello how are you yeah let me tell you something I'm sitting here on my you're sitting on your office yeah well I'll be doing I I pro board this is for living I'm a dog oh he's there he's familiar with the baker act is it he's just walked out I don't even get into that sir don't let's start getting into you know those things on the year what the baker act oh if you're familiar with the best I am okay can I see a serious question though you you're not a homeowner if yes I am you are yeah I don't own the home I live in he's talking about the gym baker acting no not the gym baker act seriously the baker act at the gym baker act although I guess in his case it did apply it does fit in it you are a homeowner I I was at one point in time sued for liable and it was covered under my homeowner's insurance policy I didn't know you were a homeowner if you rent what what covers liable what are you talking about sir what what the whole thing what does homeowner's insurance have to do with liable no that liable it's liable liable you're a doctor absolutely oh my god I think you've been looking at too many of those lately sir it's 1240 20 till one at W i o d he told us to be in what kind of doctor you want and we have one open line in date 75 one W i o d 75 1946 3 by the way you were I must say you're not right too often but you were absolutely right about Hank I mentioned that the other day but you couldn't have heard it because you were a bit tight up with all that stuff Hank is a douche bear here really is he's a puts I know he's my best friend and it pains me to say that what are you now it's just true just this this ongoing of viciousness this no not what he's done to me it's what he's attempting to do to you oh yeah well and I think you know fun and games is great and we can all like you know given take and do the shots but when it when it's personal and vicious and when he it's intended to be vicious that it's a different story and I think Hank ought to really reexamine his entire agenda and govern himself accordingly I don't comment on Hank anymore but I agree oh I'm I didn't expect him to just tell you that you had an excellent point I think the audience shouldn't be sucked in by a guy who pretends to be this constant rack on tour or whatever he is nor the nor the interesting enough the sales department he is going to members of the sales department betting them a hundred dollars I will not be here a month from today which is always helpful for morale in the sales department and I just keep running around everyone he's bed with asking if they can kind of double a bed and give me half so far he hasn't matched my thousand but what can I tell you I told Phil has another race at Carter to call me and I personally would go over there to take the number down myself I will climb up onto the scoreboard you know the totboard in the infield I will personally climb up on there and take the number down myself you know also I was thinking if I was Mike Disney I would say that I would be very angry I would be very angry you're underwear bills if you were not if I were Mike Disney I'd be very angry at Mr. Goldberg running around betting with the sales department on something like that which might deter them from selling the show and making money for the state Mike doesn't have time I do want to say that you're Mike Disney with the SEC in jack top cinnies got his own agenda and he's got important things to take care of over and over and don't bother him with these little important thoughts boy Laura certainly looks good I'm sure she looks like she's going to be bringing forth any day though throw the one I gave earlier away and this one is better boom it's science does bring in food next Friday boy you're just full of it aren't you

absolutely sucks mom glad that's a two year back can you tell if you just said I need not the sucks part do you say the other part can you say together on the radio no no it's being around the bush no we can't say that he's okay we take that back president's family gets very upset about that well I'm just glad that all the vacation over I hope yeah or nearly when you work at a real radio station you know vacations come and go and people fill in there no major problem life goes on but here it's a gigantic upheaval you know whenever it's for anybody they just can't quite get their act together and they have all these bureaucratic people running around making these wild and neurotic decisions and bringing people I just got fired into see how bad a job they can do it it's it's great I have to give you a compliment as a meal well go I've been following you for now tell you how much I love it like Alex did I've been following you for many many many years since he were like Jack would you like some license plate numbers here's a wait a minute April 1 Bob and Harlan here's that silver fox there way of silver fox pepper pines dfz no that's okay silver Toyota van I know anybody who drives the Toyota silver van go ahead I have to say that you've been very very nice about the whole situation with Mr. Thompson there I mean this is been going on for years and you've never really done anything you know you know what really we have been doing a lot of things behind the scenes we've been spending millions of dollars to try to get this goofball a finding my life and do something else but about it that what really set me off was this Chicago business this page it's got all these notes when we're in Chicago having a good time and having a few meals and seeing some ball games and just there to have a good weekend and this puts is out there making phone calls to raise a purpose up confused what was the purpose that was to find out where we were staying what was the purpose beyond that you'd have to ask him well I don't know all I know is what happened to us the next day I'm very proud that you guys have been just so good on the air about it and this guy's just looked like a total jerk in the paper and you know everything else that he's done and it's about time you guys get to say stuff about it I mean well you're going to hear a lot about it and we are regular daily feature okay so Jack's going to have to stay real close to home taping will not be sufficient he really deserves anything you guys given now because I mean you guys have been just so good as well all this guys are doing it because he's a concerned about the airwaves in about public these and at the meantime he's in a tracking us down everywhere we go and snooping around the house and picking our license plate numbers and contriving in his mind conjuring up all these illicit things that are going on in the house and I went to Vegas with some people so therefore you see he believes I guess that anybody you meet you have sex with so I guess he must be living very limited circles because they don't look like he's head too much lately but there are a lot of people yeah so I hope that's not true but quite frankly I think I guess he figures that's the only kind of relationships that people engage in oh it's really a shame that the man has nothing to help him nothing else to do zero looks all the I will tell you something you'll find very amusing and looking through thousands of these pages so far I have found three or four pages that are not directly related to me or this however they are phone calls made to places where they sell video tapes see what he does as he recores these shows on the audio on vcr and video tape every day and he's trying to buy video tapes in bulk at a lower price so that's the only other calls I found that aren't directly related to the arroggies only peripherally but I think I might might wait lately I saw a little of it the other day and I can't handle it so I'm just Holly was there with Roger in the same room and Roger's a good guy and I can't deal with him it's getting really bad don't you see we have a real life soap opera here but they bring in that kind of occupies is well you're soap opera is good but and it's real but it's that's the back part yeah exactly we can turn off guiding life yeah turn off yours excellent point well thanks again how the great weekend glad you guys are both back bye call 49 at WIOD let's see what did I do with the special what did it busy beaver that day can't believe February 13th 1988 sure of Nick Navarro Broward County Sheriff's Department for Lutterdale Florida Dear Sheriff Navarro on January 28th 1988 Neil Rogers on his daily radio program on WZTA FM at 842 AM three times called you a Nazi pig I convey this to you not to elicit any official action by your department but rather to inform you as an individual of this defamation govern yourself accordingly best JB Thompson you know the funny part of it is Nick Navarro actually likes me even though he is a Nazi pig and also it's does make any sense like couple yeah he was here with Steve and we mentioned this individual's name name and he said oh I don't want to repeat what he said yeah we can't and have anything very complimentary to say nothing that we could repeat on the air let's put it that way who's on that batline over the mystery and former this ought to be good hello this morning at 10 Neil Rogers makes way for the really big dollar I just Jeff Bartel dangerous 610 WIRD 13 Neil walked up the show and did I serve guest host this morning at 10 the bank hasn't been waiting for this opportunity all my life hey miss out on the show and play a little music from his fingers the window to make a thing to blue I don't want to give him a thing I and Morton our sports segment we're going to have a lot of clubs because we have lucky with this full of fungies and a woman's prisons and in a more serious topic we're going to discuss fashion fashion fashion and the same soap opera why double it no more never seem to go out of style and he's really pretty old story fighting and Joe's a daddy and what profit of a little fellow of my green and Neil Rogers show that's one of your 10 new stock videos that no you I would eat oh excellent Jeff I have only one thing to say let me just it off 1254 WOD they're so clever back there in that sales department you know especially Jeff Clark there is a guy with a sitting now it was cute for him especially because his sense of humor is so non-his sleeve it's amazing they have to sew it on really what I heard he has an iron on a sense of humor anyway we do have an open line in Broward which causes me great pain and consternation at 524 WOD but you're safe Christine stepped out of momentarily so now they'll start lighting up again my amy hello oh Neil yeah yeah I think there's a touch of host is going to take some of the heat off of your real-enそうだ speak Alice Randall is going to have jelly Butler dressed as a motorcycle cop administering a breathalizer test I'll get back up in the do yeah I have a feeling in a Chrissy a probably can get ring-side tickets because he seems to have a lot of good friends over there okay well we wish it a best of luck covering yourself accordingly say 1255 WOD is the plot thickens doesn't it well I'm amazed at all these Dennis Collins are communicating back and forth and then it says this and Dennis said that and Dennis said Tim William said this and Tim William said that he was tickled a death that Disney would hire him and hope that he didn't back out at the last minute that said it would set her an on and on and on because I was a bit of pill for them to swallow their WI and C slash say to four because they wanted to be consistent right across the board and the one stand and I left there man there is consistent is the weather in Pohoki aren't they question about it oh a one five and a one five and of course those those 25 to 54 is in midday and after you drive our stocking aren't they well that's what they want I mean when even the motivation station beats you then you know you've got it made I said he didn't want to be number one I remember well it's been a good spread here today we just have a nice cigar it's the one the two out one one two one oh six a WI of D 11 488 there's one more rambling of a jack that we just have to read on the ear today because I find it so interesting you're going to go to flip your week 11 488 Dennis Collins he saw Tim William's today and he admitted they never could sell Roger show right also Williams was hoping Disney would sign Rogers and was afraid Disney would back out I call to tell Dennis Kane had compounded the defamation so that's our little little bit from 11 488 three days before we started on the year here's a matter of fact now I remember couldn't sell a show 12 minutes an hour we used to add it up they added and then they added two more minutes because the show was over sold they had such demand they had a waiting list to get on the show on Zeta I remember if it's solid number of eight months we were sold out you threw a fit at the sales department one time remember it's like it was yesterday because they went over 12 minutes I remember what you said to them you said to them you can put all the spots you want on there but after 12 minutes that's all we're going to run we you had to throw a fit to get them to hold it 12 minutes that they were lined up business trying to get on that show but they couldn't sell it can't enormous rates top rates but they couldn't sell it now how come Tim wrote that memo that said that I was responsible for a third of all the billing on both station that's correct at least they couldn't sell it where did all that billing come from hi used to hear the spots every morning there were 12 minutes an hour wow maybe this is all just a dream or a fantasy because you can imagine that Tim would make up something like that and that Dennis would repeat it could you believe that man Dennis seems to be involved in these ongoing day-to-day conversations quite heavily done that yeah we're finding out that Dennis Collins a general manager of WNP to the hospital bar of petiters which would be I mean if that were true though it would be so embarrassing to find out that he's about kind of been maybe it's hurting it's wrong I mean in fact the jack wrote it doesn't make it so we have to give Dennis the benefit of the doubt don't we do we well it's eight minutes past one at Wiod we have an open line in brown well there's a lot of stuff in here that we've been waiting for for a long time to be able to piece together and then of course that incredible Chicago master piece with those phone numbers and phone calls and I don't know I don't know about you but I sure wouldn't want to be involved in snooping around in a situation where four people nearly got killed in a renegade you know what I'm saying for waterdale hello I knew hi I just wanted to find out I've been listening to you I guess the FM station I guess buddy you're year and a half oh you mean the one where they couldn't sell a show yeah I remember that not to take it insulting I was just curious how long that you've been a radio talk show host how long you've been doing this not to play in insulting well I just was curious if you've been doing this a long long time how many years I was missing your show oh 17 17 years in Florida right so I've missed your show for quite a while well it's really not much according to some you know I miss and much I also wanted to recommend I don't know when your next vacation is coming up but I just got back from I'll be happy to tell you where I'm going and listen I'll give you the name of a restaurant close time so you can call in and find out which hotel is that well I just got back from Lake Tahoe and I would recommend that to anybody it's a great spot can I tell you a little story sure years ago I was out in the California I was I think I was in Sacramento and I said to my shovel do you I think I'll drive over to Tahoe you know it's not that far and there's a there's like a fork in the road there and if you go to the right you go into the city there with all the casinos and if you go straight there's this winding narrow road that goes all the way around Lake Tahoe okay and it's about 50 miles out of the way oh man so not only is it 50 miles out of the way but it's this winding thank goodness it was in the summertime and it was breathtaking view but it's the most dangerous road and the winter they close it all again and there are these places that you have to actually come to a full stop and make almost 180 degree turn to keep going back up the mountain you know and and you look down there no guardrails or anything and you look down and there there's the lake and all these rapids and it's breathtaking view but it's a it's a nightmare of a ride you know but did you enjoy the trip no it's great I came back and I thought it was just one of the greatest spots in the world yeah it's beautiful sure if you've been there or not and I forget I'd recommend it to you because I'd recommend it to anybody it's a review is beautiful well that's all I wanted to let you know I enjoy your show and hope to listen for the next 17 okay thanks a lot thanks bye 11 after one at Wild we have an open line of bra and I'm not going to give the bokeh and pombies like there's nobody calls on those anyway I'm tired of exerting and the re-exerting and just the wasting a lot of needless energy on that those people are not a part of the show they're not a part of the state they're not a part of the planet they're just they're just like vegetating I think it's probably appropriate that we have someone on a line we call Veggie and then because they're just kind of an vegetative state Florida in braward though there is one open line if you move very very fast now because the line is forming all the way to the rascal house 524Wild if you want to be a part of this big one or two hour even if you have absolutely nothing to say what makes you any different from the rest right here's a mobile and browner hello a new all right uh i just i'm a first time caller i'll only let you show about three months now virgin caller well maybe we can get you together with a Reverend virgin we can you say virgin on the air though no i didn't think so but i don't what i'd like say is um i've you know i didn't know anything about the story is going on and everything i've been hearing you say about this guy jacked constant uh is is he supposedly a christiner or something oh yes all very much so born again christian and you know they don't hate the sinner but they hate the sin you heard that line well well what i was going to say kneel is that i'm a christian and i listened to your radio and you know i don't agree with what some things you say and some things i really like what you say but for a man who claims to be a christian and calling self calling self that to harass you and it is unlike that it's a very christian line well if you could read these letters and the language and the tone and the threats so these letters and the lies and the twisted distortions of what i say on the air certainly nobody who was really a quick a christian could possibly uh you know do these things but then again there are throughout history people of a mask themselves behind a ledge religion you know even turkey modus that he was a christian right and uh Hitler and his SS had the you know got his on our side on their belt buckles and thought that they were christians too so just calling yourself something doesn't make it so that's right you know i just want to let you know just because you know what he says he's doing it isn't really you know backing up his supposedly a lifestyle that that really that's what it is you know that you know i i really enjoy your showing all i could say if you don't like something that you say you can always turn the dial exactly and but i really appreciate you know you guys not slamming him that that shows more character and morals on your part then i think it does on his part well we certainly are looking to twist or manipulate any of the things that he said or to try to assign you imply crimes where there aren't any or have any investigations all we want us to go ahead live our lives and do our thing and the heaven find a new hobby you know right okay have a great week you too Neil by but once 13 at wild and open line in date now if you move real fast okay this is the psychology that we have to go back to uh five two four nine four six three

question for you seriously but the problems you're having okay let's say it happened to a judge that would be ended real quick we were here i got news for you if any judge in this time was getting the harassment that i'm getting for two years and having people stupid rather houses and write down license plate numbers and make a general nuisance of themselves and calling all over the country to find out where they were staying on vacations uh you know as well as i do boy they would did the stiff arm of the law would come down so fast that our friend wouldn't know what hit him that's right that's the point in time yeah well you know most of these joy i'm sorry you know my attorney friends they seem to think that some of these judges are really hotshot and some of marocay but there are some in this time man i wouldn't give you a 15 cents forum they're just uh about to suit all intellectual douchebags and they look at everything like it's some kind of intellectual exercise as opposed to uh day in and day out life you know when you got somebody that's devoting their entire existence to ruining your life and i'm not exaggerating uh then you really got a real story going on you know i'll i'll tell you this and and you know it and and for the yoyo that's listening i know hundreds of people when i turned on literally dozens to your show over the years when you were straight talk and also when you went to the stick type talk and they all love it i have a retalk straight split i don't think straight talk who can't say that no that'll really confused you but i've been listening to you for probably eight nine years and uh i don't know any i i got a change that i don't want person that can plane about out of hundreds that i know yeah so and i bet you they turned it off but you had a fact he did yeah no he turns it off there's a matter of evolutionary idea but you know if you have a lot of people out here that really enjoyed your show and i'm not trying to you know suck up to you in any any way i mean it legitimately because it's it's kind of tiring when you get good stuff on the air good entertainment stuff that people enjoy and you got some meatball in the name of whatever he's donor in yeah that wants to wants to knock it off and ruin it for everybody else he's got a finger you know he could use it to turn the dial over whatever he wants to do with it but he doesn't have to pull this kind of garbage and there's an awful lot of people that are pretty hot about it you know it's another interesting thing and looking through all his rambling here in the dates on them now he very clearly lied in front of one of our judges here in date county a few months ago when we had a hearing because he kept emphasizing over and over again that didn't want to get me off the air didn't want to deprive me of alive there because you know that's a separate actionable thing and that only wanted to do is clean up the act and yet in this series of thousands of letters and notes and so on it's just repeated over and over again must be gotten off the air shouldn't be on the air he recently wrote a letter to senator in a way up and washing in about all I shouldn't be behind a microphone at a business being on the air so on the one hand he will say for public consumption that he's just trying to clean up the air waves and on the other hand he's trying to attempt to deprive me of a livelihood even if I said he'll reading nursery rhymes he still wants me off the air well tell you something if I had something haunting my life for two years like you do I don't know how you uh in any zoo okay day in one piece in eighties I think I would have fallen apart and done something else myself well but I wish you a lot of luck and I know an awful lot of thousands of people do and hope you stay on the air forever I'm not going anywhere believe me and you and a bird got a terrific show okay thanks a lot okay one forty one a w outie now says hotline fanom collar now this is that same guy again because you know Nick it says last day with the show he hates the show to begin with and if this fanom collar is that same guy again and they of course would have the hotline and I'll take the last 20 minutes of the show and I'll go through every page you to here just to find that memo about next conversation with Jack okay hello Neil Rogers makes way for the who he really big talent I just jet part tell manager six ten w i o d thirteen new walk up the show and it's the same thing we it was okay once their subsides yeah their so obsessed but it was funny the first time but not for an encore okay I mean it was mildly amusing the first time but let's get serious kick an act with fifty thousand colors ladies and gentlemen this is the lightning row on the Neil Rogers show how many lions he is there such a station still as they on the air I mean I sure saw that they couldn't sell my show over there you have a 10 Williams because he has such a bright guy you know I could understand Tim Williams and Dennis Collins having a lot of conversations together because boy you know what they say about birds of a feather isn't there some expression about that birds of a feather their numbers suck together something like that which reminds me there's a trend coming out on monday uh oh I'm not too concerned about this one but I think that when the summer book comes out that Alex Tony Bennett I keep thinking that week that's gonna be in there wow and I always remember the two weeks I did in July they were like I see and I know they were but you don't know that now you don't know that because it's four weeks not the two other weeks that I was you're looking and read for this let me read for this arithmetic the two weeks that I was here out of those four could have been an eight and two weeks that I wasn't here could have been a four and that average is out to a six great I'm not saying it was or they won't know very well could nobody know but now while you can find out I can go into the week by we didn't dig that out for us you're that I was going to your day but I'm not if you're that positive that you were a holding your into the bargain there's no problem we'll go into the research I'm sure that will bear you out in fact when I was here they probably went down quite a bit I'm just saying it stayed through July that's all my bad I'm real happy about that I'm real pleased that the number stayed through the whole entire month well management doesn't feel the same way okay let's go to Miami hello that I post this question has Susan Martin and Jack Compton ever been seen together well that is an excellent question we're going to go out and check license plates this week and it'll find out if perhaps so we're not dealing with just one person okay hello what I don't see how you got from one to the other I mentioned a few trivial baseball names and when trivia comes to mind I came to know immediately pop not to yours no I thought he was the trivia king of this park with me yeah what is wrong well this caller wants to ask the same thing hello hi I do you want to ask about what's wrong with him I don't know who this guy is it's laughing everything you said there you go it's so just concerning well how do you think I feel yeah I would I said that Joe Collins died we could go he starts laughing he laughs at everything he's in here well we're you man I think you are too you know you're so childish sorry you oh oh I think you hung up on you for hanging up and not speaking to me very childy no she just don't want to talk to you she doesn't oh here's that Steve letter I'm gonna have to show that to me when he comes back in February 13th 88 I wonder what was going on that day because boy talk about friends we gotta look and see what day of the week that one wow so random letters were just pouring out of that house I'm believe Miami hello hello Neil welcome back
