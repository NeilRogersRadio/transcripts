13 at WIO Day the bad news we got part of this story yesterday remember I told you that or we got informed by Sharon through I don't know who that W. snooze was putting on Paul Harvey as of yesterday your mic's not on because mic's not on Marvin hello okay it's on now top day here it's been a rough day well rough day in shock after this morning anyway the other part of the change over there and this could be the beginning you know we keep hearing these rumors about the gradual changes from the live talk we do not only know is one for months yeah Craig Warding is out uh Sally Jesse on tape is in on tape which they're gonna play the 7 to 10 PM that she does from one to four in a morning and then replay the first hour over again from four to five now Sally isn't worth hearing the first time okay and then much less the second time so this could just be the tip of the iceberg over there at WIOLD and the thing that really pisses me off is that I keep you know sitting back and watching friends of mine and people in this business who are good talents and nice people getting screwed over and over again first it was Bill Carter then I was staying major nights Craig Warding and got only knows who will be next so you see having talent in this market means nothing it doesn't count and I'm sure there are people in the audience saying well it's true for you to find that's great but it really is pathetic I mean there are people working in this business in this market who shouldn't even be allowed into a radio station I mean not even to sweep the floor okay and there are talented people who are sitting on a sidelines going through grief and Craig's gone through the several times not the last few years undeservedly so because he's a funny guy he's a really a good talent he's a funny guy and he was buried there first of all from one to five in the morning almost nobody in there right mind would want to work those hours to begin with but he did and then of course you recall the situation when we were still at Zeta and they wanted to get Larry King sure and they told and they told him well the only reason they told him is because we got wind of it we put it on the air so they were forced to tell him and they told him in a real nice way well if we get King you're out if we don't get him you're still you still got a job unbelievable you know and that was the bottom line over there at WOLD and I know I've taken a lot of shots for example I just sliced this place to pieces when we were at Zeta and part of the reason being well they had made a lot of mistakes and also I had never met Disney and I really didn't know very much about what this company was doing and the changes they were making but I got news for you man that WOLD that outfit over there that that's about as low as you can go the way they operate that whole thing I don't even know what term to use for it it's a thing over there and just throw on that old flock that they've been peddling out for got him he knows how long and now they put Sally Jesse who is about as terminal you know her TV show is bad enough but her radio show is just terminal what do they call her counselor without portfolio which means she has absolutely no qualifications whatsoever to give anybody any advice and she sits there and in 30 seconds or less she's gonna solve people's lifetime problem is okay she can't solve her own problem she's only been fired what 38 times or something like that somehow to rage them out of times and the only reason that she's catching on now that she's had any success now with the TV thing is because it came along at a time when everybody's got a TV talk show this is trendy and so she happened to come along at a time when she could exploit the same bizarre twisted topics that all these other frakers are doing yeah so there's no live overnight talking the no live well I'm better a fact there's no live talk from nine p.m. to six a.m. I mean witch certainly doesn't count live talk okay you got a good boy I mean his wig expired 20 years ago and nobody told him all right so he keeps to bring it in every night but I mean he that's not live talk that's that's foolishness garbage for ancient geriatric rednix that's what that shows all about hi dear you're gonna be checking yeah you know that three hours of that are four hours and then nobody overnight and I got news for him and it really sucks it really stink this is supposed to be a major market is one of the top ten or eleven markets in the country and there is no live talk at night anywhere in the market and overnight you got a you know a choice of listening to some ravi voice douchebag out of Arlington virginia I don't want to mention his name his on this station or now Sally Jesse crazy Sally's not so bad when you can see around TV and laugh at the pink glasses but on radio you can't even see the pink glasses through so Craig gets a screw to get a royal um finger the fickle finger of fate and I'm gonna call him I'm gonna have him on the show one day this week because the thing that they did to him so par for the course that they do with everybody in this business they don't give him a chance to say goodbye in other words on monday morning yesterday they tell him well or whenever was a told him what was after his last show you're not gonna be on again that's standard yeah standard in the business uh this doesn't affect on well I mean he's only been in a market for 14 15 years Craig were they were longer than that I don't know some incredible amount 15 or 16 year yeah don't ask me about on web I wouldn't dignify with a response the wicked web yeah in fact if he's still gonna be on wouldn't that be something because he's only been kind over there about 20 times and keeps coming back for more punishment there's a guy with no shame whatsoever I mean seriously he's been fired over there at least a half a dozen times literally and he keeps coming back and he said hey how about uh you know we're desperate how about going on on the weekend over not sure anything you want you know I'm desperate too obviously real desperate well you know when you're the cast and over the community it's kind of difficult to find enough time to make a living sure so I just thought I mentioned a lot of people are audience don't know who Craig is because he hasn't been on a daytime show in a market for years a lot of people who are talk show groupies in a market know him very well and I just thought I'd pass it along to you because it really stinks it sucks the big one is what it does okay but that's WOLD man you know they're not the only ones because we do it here and uh i and z certainly has done it for a long time with an awful talk net with Bruce Williams and uh all that and Sally used to be on there on long that's right she got bounced out of there and now she's overrun ABC is it I guess whatever I don't know where the hell she is and everything is making difference because no matter what network she's on she's still just is boring and just is unqualified to give anybody advice counselor without portfolio that's like saying brain surgeon without degree kind of similar I would say 21 past 10 at WIOD if you're looking for a meeting and pleading with you over the years don't even think about getting into this business a lot of young people you know what to get into broadcasting they want to be uh sports casters or talk show host or disjockeys or whatever it forget it okay it's the road to hell it's the road to absolute immediate nervous breakdown it's not because the business itself isn't a lot of fun it could be but the people and management for the most part are more on don't you understand people who don't have any talent and can't do anything else become program directors general managers now when they totally blow it everywhere in a business then they become consultants okay when they can't get a real job with the station then they come in and they screw up everybody else's station all right consultants and I just want to make this comment and by the way they do have consultants here at this station just like they have all around this market radio stations that hire consultants ought to be embarrassed they ought to hang their heads and shame because you know what that's like they would be like if you're a housewife hiring a consultant to come into teach you how to do housework because it's like an admission that you don't know what they're how you're doing see for example if you're a program director of a major market station we just got a new PD so we you know we exclude Gary because he just started yesterday we'll pick on him next week but the bottom line is if you're the PD you're so you're being paid because you supposedly know something about programming a radio station you know about music or you know about talk you know about news you got to know something and yet when you look at the long list of programming mavens for example I'd want to mention mark Q from i and z or rose foldger from zeta who would be very nice people if they were saying pushing a cart you know it's a bread hotdog stand on a street corner somewhere they'd be very nice folks to to chat with but within the context of this business are impossible because they haven't got a clue is to what they're doing not a clue I mean we I could go on we could do a monologue about bulge of the rest of the show nice guy outside of the business a super guy outside of the business but unfortunately within the context of the company that he's working for and within the context of the job that he's in which is way over his head at least in his market I mean he's a one-dimensional person he did something in portland ore gone which was very successful up there he thinks he can do it here and for two years he's been trying to force me the audience here music that they don't want to hear but he else for it he else for it for the fact that the numbers don't go on and how many times how many conversations did we have always say hey you've got to play some current music you got to play some artists that you don't like like Billy Joel or you know a whole bunch of others you can't let your personal taste interfere and you know something even the music that I like and I like you know about twenty thirty percent of the music they play on that station even though we don't have great feelings toward them but even a music I like I'm beginning to this like because every time I punch them up they're playing the same thing I love the dubie brothers but how many times can you listen to china grow you know I mean how how many times can you listen to the same records over and over again you'll never believe this but I want buy them on the dial this morning driving to work and CCR was on yeah very said matter fact this weekend they played I mentioned I heard a block of BTO today here's a block but hey here's a block of CCR before the first notes sounded I punched it out yeah and before I started the work in there fact before we were at wins in the daytime and we started listening to their format I used to like CCR they were alright some of their stuff's pretty good but after you've heard it for the 20,000 time it's like sweet duty blue eyes now there's a classic example how you can take somebody's favorite record and turn it into something they almost ate sweet duty blue eyes but crossbeats those in the ass used to be one of my five or ten favorite records it's a classic it's an epic record okay it's just made and they just bang it bang it bang it bang it bang and to the point where just I'd hear those first guitar notes man I want to blow my brains out I didn't and because it's such a long record it's about six and a half minutes long at least and they just have they just don't want to expand or open up new horizons they just want to keep pound in the same crap out and they don't understand why nobody's listening to it so must be my fault or your fault or somebody's fault but it's not bolder's fault and it is his fault because he's ultimately responsible for programming that station I tried to explain the market to him some but now they don't want to listen they've all got the answers man they don't they've just go down in flames with their own failure they don't want to listen by the way I'll give you an example at consultant told me years ago and you may remember this a great example of what a consultant does and this consultant told me it's like someone comes and tells you how to make love but they can't do it because they're interesting yeah yeah that's a consultant that's correct like I said it's somebody who can't get a job doing anything else in a business so as the last resort they become consultants and they run around telling everybody else how to do it we they haven't got a clue perfect example well I got a lot of consultant stories number one you remember we had lead you let there who had some personal problems and I was doing a fine-out in Phoenix but Lee had a one of the great voices in radio I mean no still today and one of the greatest voices in radio and television in the country yeah and he did this booming production all this great sounding real real sharp sounding strong powerful stuff and what are the consultants do they had some guy who sounded like we used to call the 10 year old boy and Cleveland or Cincinnati somewhere yeah yeah well the high voice like this Zeta for another classic I'm Zeta for that's it have to be old exactly and a guy sounded like his a 10 year old kid sounded like a pd and y100 you know and that's what they took all the lead you let stuff off which is great powerful sounding production they put all this crap on okay because the consultant why don't know to put it on that's right on believe it I like when they brought the new consultant and and bolder told us this was the marketing oh yeah yeah he was too embarrassed to admit they had another condolences and who was their first consultant over there and this is inside stuff but the audience loves it they'd feed on this yeah Rick's Clar yeah they bring is the first consultant now most of you are too young to know who Rick's Clar was because he's like from before Joey Reynolds okay which is like before the father time god's Clar was the guy who put on WABC in New York many many years ago and it was the big rock station with cousin Bruci and herb Oscar Anderson all those people and Danny Roman Scott Munis so anyway that that was his claim to fame and of course the bottom line was WABC was not a good sounding station to begin with it was dramatically overproduced with 8 billion crimes and fongs and the reverb that could sound like it was coming from Carl's bad caverns but it just happened to have this gigantic signal that covered about 40 states tonight it was you know is right there 50,000 watts and 77 and it was the dominant rock signal in New York so naturally they did tremendously well for many years with that until somebody came along started competing and then they you know that's why they're doing a garbage talk now on ABC so Rick's Clar they bring in to consult the AM which at that time was mostly talk we're on AM he knows nothing about talk and it consult the FM which was a which was a O.R. which again a man knows nothing about a O.R. you know nothing about radio a period since the days way back in a 50s and 60s when he was in his heyday and that should give you a pretty good idea of what goes on and why no seriously I was talking to the new our new program director yesterday was asking me to you know give him some insights into this market there there are no insights into the market it's a bush late town I mean most of the radio in his town is so bad it's embarrassing the music on FM here some of the worst you will ever hear in any I'm not just major market in any market there's that station up the coast I can never think of the call it is it's on 92. something or whatever that big rock station on FM it's not in Orlando but it's on the east coast it's like do we I don't know where the hell it is is it the one in Fort Pierce oh and it whatever it is it's a great sounding station and a music is tremendous I mean it just play every record is a hit every record is great it's just it's a sensational sounding radio station it's here is yeah every time I think that's what what whatever it is it's a great sounding station the stations in this market man it's like it's like they're one of when it's sold to you they keep playing all some square crap and stuff that you don't want to hear anymore and and you can go for like a half hour at a time you can go a half hour at a time and punch up and now most of the car radio is you got 12 FM presets why I don't know because the right 12 FM stations you'd want to punch in there but you can punch everyone that's playing music and not hear anything but you ever want to hear again ever and you can do that for half hour 45 minutes and you just keep swearing and of course I don't know why I guess when you're in the car radio is a habit even though you got your 30 players and cassette decks they're just a lot of us who are used to hearing the radio when you're in the car that to me is radio listening time I do not turn on the radio very often at home really hmm but it's just frustrating is how it's garbage that's why I end up so often trying to work listening to the sounds of the city nothing a lot old on those windows that's right it's 1033 at WIOD if you've ever been turned down for alone because lots of times he would feel in if somebody was sick and then come back into his own shift overnight and pull double duty and just anything they wanted which is just his nature they just that's a kind of guy he is he would give you the shirt off his back and you know winds up getting the screwing I mean not that they had some great job that they were given them anyway because that's the graveyard shift and there are very few people who'd want to do it and I'm sure that the outlay of cash that they were putting out the payment for that show was minimal at best minimal at best but we're going to have him on one day this week so we'll have the opportunity to chat with the number one and number two give him a chance to speak to the audience which they naturally try to deprive you of doing as if you're going to go on a year and say you know horrendous things or something on your last day which is ridiculous because if you want to work in a business again it just doesn't happen that way but see the management people because they are for the most parts such douchebags they don't know how to end a relationship gracefully it's like when we left over at Zeta and we were there for ages you know weeks after we agreed that you know we were leaving I told him hey goodbye and they finally said okay good luck to you and here's a letter of release which I had a scream and shouting yelled again but you know and we were willing to just stay until a reasonable point and not leak it out not publicize it and try to do it in a reasonable way and it just they couldn't handle and we were going to stay for months well not long let's not get carried away okay you know it's amazing how you get emotional about it was in two months a month about a month and a half well that's close max max why still that's close what I thought don't say months what because it sends chills up my spine I realized that just thinking about that it doesn't have to be all to be a classic oh yes it does it does have to be all to be a client they couldn't make up their mind man they didn't know whether the screamer eat four bananas over there they still don't know I mean I got news for you it isn't that hard and I give you another example there were some we yesterday we're talking about all these TV shows and about the thing about heavy metal is though heavy metal just started which is ridiculous because it's been around for years and years I mean K102 went out of that format and became magic how many years ago many several years ago yeah and but but the point is here again another example I don't like a lot of that music I don't like most of that music but there's definitely a market for it and the fact that none of the FM's in this market really incorporate very much of that indicates again there's a major omission you just got a whole bunch of people all trying to do the same thing I mean how many slush 94s do you need you got joy playing that music now and slush 94s planted now even life is starting to play like Neil Diamond Records and Barbara Streisand stuff like that vocals and how many states do you need doing the same thing it's like those days when we had four talk stations in the market boy you talk about overkill that that period of time when GBS was on for what was it year year and a half and with their one shares that leaf follower and Dennis Collins so brilliantly engineered those with the day did just kill talk in this market as we knew it which is one of the reasons that ultimately I got to do an at kind of talk because there was such a burnout on every subject that's ever been invented and every guest in this market this isn't New York okay it's not Los Angeles those are the only two markets maybe Philadelphia and Washington I guess those are the only four markets I can think of even Chicago and Detroit don't have that many real name people that you'd want to interview on a talk show but this is my amy they're nobody here to talk do I mean it's about a half a dozen to a dozen chronic guests and they keep showing up on the same shows all the time and I'm always needling Steve about it but I realize you don't have a lot of choice because there is a very limited number of people and when the programming people keep forcing you to do guests who are you going to put on and I've told that story many times about how I used to keep those books those notebooks with all my guests and and I'd go back and I'd look at their be the same names over and over again I mean good people nice people although some of them were boring like Ed Cohen but I mean I'd see those same names over and over and I think to myself gee I'm not I can do better than this anybody can do better than this now this fits in and this is absolutely true when I tell you this I had a dream last night oh gee I had a weird dream last night too did you now and try to remember what it was about very strange dream I remember this one because it sort of burned into my brain Laura had a strange dream last night because she was looking at Marvin when she was talking about I had a dream this is serious that you when as a guest on the sandy paten show I am serious as a heart as well I know what my dream was my dream was that I was I was supposed to be doing play by play of the mommy he basketball game at the arena and it was like 40 afternoon and there was this thunderstorm and I kept thinking the game was going to get rained out with back basket ball games don't get rained up but in a dream you know some good when you're under a lot of pressure in this business you know and then I remember showing up and I couldn't find a press box and it was like 10 minutes till airtime you and I both had ready to shoot up at the last minute I had somebody drive me there and he dropped me off and I ran in I had no idea where I was going I had no information I had no blind ups and no nothing and I run and I find a press box and there's one of our engineers I don't know who it was some non-existent person up there with a sorely looking guy dirty with a dirty shirt on and he's the color guy he's doing a color and a game and he's not speaking to me at all and I'm saying well do we have any line ups do we have anything and I'm looking to stuff on the floor and just searching for scraps of something and you know what that is that's another variation of the same dream I used to talk about about finding yourself alone in the station and trying to read the news and running out of copy and have a no record shoot up any of the unprepared is the word and the mirror of being unprepared so when you do this kind of a show you don't have to be prepared because if you're full of crap like I am you can just come on and just talk forever which I might do today I don't think we might take any calls today you know don't answer any more from just let them I don't know why even bother because most of the colors are more on as anyways so why waste our time with that if they were so good they'd have their own show right if they had anything to say they don't have anything to say are you doing guys are you doing burn huh huh huh huh huh huh huh huh so in the dream I was talking what's hanging guys I was talking to Sandy's produced I thought like a they sound like pilly hermen at different speed okay you were talking to Sandy's producer yes and we were saying I wasn't that criminal Sandy Payton still on the year boring the world she got a sense of humor for five seconds it came out on Steve show yesterday all Steve downplayed I don't know what Steve's new love affair is with the people at WOLD but he was you know his good friend Debbie Ellis and his good friend Sandy I don't know what they're how he's talking about unless he's looking ahead him up for a loan or something but but I mean Sandy with her her hysteria about bilingualism I mean I give up that subject years ago and I realize that there were a lot of bigots who were trying to exploit the issue and use me in a program and you know took me a while but I finally realized that it was just a waste wasted time at a very divisive issue but man there isn't a month that goes by that she doesn't have a hairy robin's actually not doing another and isn't it amazing that in the Cuban community they're always screaming about neoroggers and what a bigot I'm supposed to be but when it comes to Sandy Payton maybe that's because nobody listens to her show good point but that's all she talks about between a collectible guys and TV repairman the only other things she's got is bilingualism well she's obsessed with it I do like that so here Craig is out of a job who could really he could probably give us some competition during these hours because he's a funny guy and it does a fun show and she's over there in that in that book in a fall book we beat her already and we were only on five weeks what is that yeah I mean she was doing four is in five's before we came over here now he's already going down in the three how about the and dropping like a rock well I do I kind of like and then that Debbie Ellis other than being a you know the size of Arlene Ross's butt what is her story he's no talent I never forget the day that the guy from New Times called me for that ridiculously wrote and it was like he was in shock because he couldn't believe what I was saying he's not a major talent by far far from it she's just another knee jerk liberal kind of from the Shirley Peter school abroad casting who repeats the same old tired crap night after night after night there's no entertainment there zero then whole station is a zero it's tired it's old it's our cake it's 1045 at Wiod year wound up like an alarm clock well up because I'm sick and tired of watching good decent people having their lives ruined by the morons who manage in on these radio stations it's disgusting don't confuse anybody with the fact that somebody likes personality a or personality b likes stand stand was only number one and he afternoon over there okay book it in book out great demographics you know he was the last vestige of reality they had on Wions he he was the only thing that they had left on that station and they blow them out because they want to play safe okay because they're scared of their own shadow over there so let's put on the old news and get all those good old demographics that nobody wants to buy and go back into the twos which is exactly where they are and station with that signal with the best signal of any am station on the daytime in the state of Florida now incredible and they got twos what about Zeta see I could take and believe me I'm not trying to do this for a knee go trip but anybody with minimal knowledge of broadcasting could take those two radio stations over there just use an example and make them both number one in six months I guarantee that if you could get the right talent and if you were left to your own resources and allow to do your own thing make them both number one and both big money makers in six months so something's got to be wrong is there big ifs boy well yeah well that doesn't happen because people that are brought in well you're going to be the program director but you can't decide this and you can't decide that and you can't fire this one and you can't hire that one and you can't spend any money and you can't be creative and you can't do this so you know all it does is make you a glorified bookkeeper because the people in management more often they're not don't have any idea about any of that bookkeeper enters a ton of it you have to do for the FCC and for god only knows who else and so they have to find glorified bookkeepers that's what mark you that's why he's still over there at wins because they admire the fact that he was a good bookkeeper he could keep all of those forms filled out and you know all of those files filled and all of that you like to have you know against the employees all of that stuff real well look at office manager exactly so people who are called program directors in this business very often aren't really program directors at all they're just it's a great term you come on put their office managers that's all they just organize paperwork they fill out all the network stuff and they send it in on time and all the all the pay those things that you fill out right call us because I know time sheets yeah the time to the pay the weekend schedule always comes out and schedule is very big part of it that's all about look at that all the lines you're letting out and I said we might not even take well we will take some calls because we wouldn't want to upset our dear friends out there in radio land would we because Marvin's gone to the trouble answering all these calls and it would be a shame it would be wrong his Nixon would say just leave all these people hanging so the end of the dream was I was talking to Sandy's there's a new one just the end well she was her producer speaking in English or Spanish or was she going back and Sandy came over and she says you know I just don't know I just I just can't get the ratings Neil does and the producer looked there and says you're not eating on the air that's the end of the journey oh yeah well tune in this morning folks we'll give you a permission for a few minutes Sandy may be picking out on the air today I'll never forget you talk about desperate do you remember the show that she did she always when she was on a station she always had that high that pseudo intellectual plane where she was above the frame she wouldn't talk about other talkcoast wouldn't get down in the mud you know was ready or anybody else and then she did a show where she asked the audience do you want me to do that I mean that that has got to be the most desperate lack of a show that I've ever heard in my life that's even worse than doing one of those old Bob Lasseter polls okay good lord positive or negative speaking of that what are we doing tomorrow positive or negative well you know when Lasseter was doing the show the audience with that audience he had it would always be negative matter what what but I gotta say one thing I'm saying well yeah quickly because I do like the bilingual proctologist you know I got to be fair yeah the one who speaks to assholes in both lines it's 1050 1050
