Yeah, the BB Robozo of South Florida talk radio. It was it. Barry is online. Oh, Barry. Oh, Barry. I love that. Speak to us Barry. Well, that took a lot of prompting, you know what? I knew. I knew. What a guy. We're doing great. I saw Jared by the way in the newsroom. Is he coming in for lunch today? I don't know. Jared gets first cracker. I don't think Todd is here yet. And besides, it's almost sharpest in a couple hours. So Jared should get in here and get a little something. Bert, did you see Indiana Jones yet? No. Come on, Barry. Get serious. Well, yeah. Why would he want to see Indiana Jones? On stop action. How was it? We like it? Most of the movies that Steve has from that place have nonstop action too. At least this is the action you can talk about. Oh, I see. What can I do? You know, do they have Indiana Jones? What can you do us for? I was just joking around to see if we could prompt you to call in. I've already wanted to. When you got to talk to, when you invite Barry, I want to say that when you've got to talk to or you can mention somebody's name and you've only got one line still open and they're willing to call in. That's power. That's power. That's power. That's what canterall says. You're the only guy in the who can do that. You do a consistent. The individual. The only way to the invitation. All he was. When you're not there or for the invitation. Right. So what's going on Barry? You've been all right. We're getting ready for our limousine showdown in November at the diplomat. Great. I'm going to invite you guys down for that. Now, Boon, what are you doing here by the way? See, Boon is talking about. What is it? What is it that you're doing? What are you doing? Well, I noticed, but what are you doing? Well, we have the chicken caster. No, no, I'm not asking what we've got. I'm sure it's always great, but what are you doing? This is just. This is an offer you. To gicking it out for us. But you're going to leave some for these other people. Roger, I'm sure you'll want a little bit. Little. And Jared and the newsroom. The news interns get to eat first on the show from now on. Okay. And Andy also, Andy's not an intern, but he needs the help. I have to ask that. One for you and one for them. Two sets of what? A food? Oh, my God. You went nuts, Boon. One for us, one for them. Wow. What a guy. See, he knows what's going on. That is shocking. And so Roger needs to be taken care of. You're going to get about, okay. Let's go. Give a nick or couple of curry pots. That's right. I don't have to do it. Nick is a silly mother, okay. It's 1046 at WI. And he, when I was exciting talking to Barry Epstein. Was he gone? Oh, Bob. He said something. I forgot all about you, Barry. I know. It's easy to do that. I want to do that. A great happy holiday weekend. Okay, Barry. Thank you. Well, we went ahead and met a Barry. You got something special here. Just for you. I love myself. Wait a minute. No. No. In the light. No. Yeah. Okay, sir. Don't get it. Go ahead, Barry. Can't say I'll get it. Yeah, Barry. David for the adventure. David, Matt. Okay. See you, Barry. Wow. What a card, huh? That's my favorite. Yeah. I knew the new favorite. And it's even better than then. Oh, I know what's wrong with this. We don't play this anymore. Roger, we play the loop. As they say in Chicago. And what happened to my loop by boy? This thing is all messed up again today. They had a wild morning. What happened on Reneri show this morning, boy? Carts are all out of order here and everything is nuts. Was it? Was it that crocodile dumb D call? Was that what it was? Yeah. Let's see. We think you'll find an appropriate place in the sales area to display this memo. Ha ha ha ha. We can use this. It says if assholes could fly this place. Would be an airport. Ha ha ha ha ha. We ought to put this up in the sales department. That was you. We're in Disney's office. One of the other. That is. I never heard that before. Wow. Spring 88 prospects. Here's the Chicago Cubs. Mark Grace. Oh, this is from last year in Greg Jefferies. And Derek Lilacwiss. Well, this is pretty exciting. A lot of baseball stuff that you obviously aren't too anxious to hear this. Or maybe next hour. Okay. Here's a mobile on it. Hello. Hey. Yeah. I'm the gun. Okay. It's happening. Not too much, pal. I know this is going to be the icebreaker for the show. Yeah. I know. Okay. I was a gun. Let me ask you a question. Let me ask you a question. Yeah. What's going on? I don't know. I was a gun. I don't know. Okay. He played on a bit of a couple of days ago about the sales. You know what? All the salespeople? Oh, yeah. You're like a real short bit. Yeah. You started? Do I still have it? Yeah. Well, I'm stalling for time now while I'm looking for we better still have it. Because it's kind of like epitomizes the whole place to me. I don't. Yeah. We still got it. What about it? Do you want to hear it? Yeah. Oh, you don't want to hear it, do you? Salespeople are assholes. Is that the one you're mad? Crap. Something like a vacuum cleaner salesman to be. It's 1049, 11. 11. 11. A Wildy. The Palm Beach line is open. We're off to quite a start today. 655. Wildy. What are you doing? He's just sitting here and pouring stuff out on the plates. Now look at is that all curry pop? There's enough curry pop there for the whole Chinese army. I can't believe it. They can give it to all those demonstrators over there and calm them down. All right. Wow. I can't do a Chinese on the foot today. Choice of soup. What do you got? Coconut milk or hot and sour. Boy, that's this is great. That's difficult. But it's real. Look at that. We got the stuff on the stick two today. Is that the port? Really good. So, I'll stuff on the sticks on the work site and. It's 1050 and we'll come right back. We got it. We got it. Every time I hear her name, all she's getting to treat her. Sweet up. It's good. It's got a little bit of meat in the sand. How old are you going to be coming out? Yeah. The 1910 fruit gum company. Good. You don't you remember yummy yummy yummy? That's the one I remember. I got something in my tummy. I'm going to be. Anyway, if the newsroom is going to eat, you better come in or forever hold your pieces. I'm not going to beg these people to come in here. Okay, because that's getting ponderous. All right. Those blueness preparing in his own generous, wonderful ways. Putting all these plates together. And this stuff is, I don't know how. How do you bring it all the way down here and keep it hot? Not easy. Yeah. Miracle man. Hmm. It's really hard to ask him a question. Not easy. No, it's true. It's true. It's not easy. Crawl away from the other day. But anyway, so that, like, with the next couple of minutes, if they don't start coming in, we're just going to throw it out. I'm serious because I'm tired of begging. And you notice what happens. And all of a sudden, like a half hour later, there's like, his big line comes in here. And there's nothing here. He's food. And he's here today. It's here now. Okay. It's in here now. And he, Jared, whoever the hell might be in here. You think Rick Weaver's going to come in and have lunch? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, why are you laughing? Why am I laughing? Well, I'm sure he will. Oh, this coconut milk soup is just tremendous. And what? I don't like the name of that. But you should change the name. Oh, seriously, because it's great and the name sounds Colossus. It sounds terrible. Isn't that how they say it in China? Colossus? Hmm. Premier Colossus. The mayor of Holus. The local local, local, local, local, local. Oh, excuse me. So we can't say that. Hmm. So I guess the newsroom isn't going to eat today, huh? Rogers coming in. He's no fool. Sure. Go right ahead. Hey, if they want to be slow in there, no problem. See, the accounting people have got some brains downstairs. We got to say that because it's pating. We haven't got to check you out. Yeah, but put together a plate for this wonderful gentleman. He makes our checks out. And usually adds a few hundred extra because we feed him. 1054, W.I.O.D. here's a call about Dion. Hello. Neil. Yeah. Hi. How are you? Great. I bought the Dion disk a couple of days ago and it is great. Isn't it phenomenal? I taped it on my nice cassettes or I have it in my car and I dropped the work and I let's do it tremendous. But I was wondering if you could maybe play a song from it. Yeah, I'm going to. Okay. I'll leave it up to you then. So I'm going to play. Well, see, there's so many good cuts on there. But the definitive one is the, what is it? Right on the subway wall. See, I had it on the tip of my tongue. That's the one I wrote down. I was going to request it. In fact, I was going to play that little segment from Little Star by the elegance. Yeah. And then play the record when you listen to Paul Simon saying it. It's just shocking, you know. And yesterday I heard you play that little cut about. I'll take a Rickshaw ride. That was pretty funny. Rickshaw or a, um, rotor or something. Yeah. It's something. It's all the same to me he said. What do you guys eat? We're eating a Thai food boy. It's great. Is it hot or spicy? It's a little honest, but not real spicy, but it's a little spicy. It's delicious. I'm poking it soup, whatever is that. I'm poking it. Oh, here they finally come. Okay. After we've twisted their arms. Is that stuff warm? Of course it's warm. It's hot. What does it look like? Yeah. Now look at this. Have you ever seen it? I've ever seen it. Where did bone go? Boon just disappeared. Don't get boon all. Boon we got the stuff to do in here. Don't let them, uh, hockey would try to cut there in a hall. I'm sorry. Go ahead. I was wondering what it looked like. It looks like time to look like. Well, there's like some chicken stuff. And there's one with all vegetables with little baby corns and cauliflower and broccoli. It's similar to Chinese or that. Similar only more vegetables and more spicy and tasty. You know, that kind of stuff. What are you like directing or just getting lemon? It's shut the door. Oh, yeah. Just shut the door and don't let anybody else in. Listen, I was wondering if I could call my friends Leslie and Gail and Duskberg. Whatever you like there. I'm happy if that is what it takes. I'm very happy. You guys make me happy. Great. Enjoy your lunch. Thank you. Bye. What does it look like? It looks like food. Good food. Well, she just doesn't know Thai food. You got to admit if you don't know what Thai food is. The logical thing. That's what that doesn't look like. Food. It looks like. Mm-hmm. Is everybody going to get fed here? This is by the way kosher for Paisa. I just wanted to mention that. So that Laura can be sure that she doesn't go drift a straight. Isn't Todd here today? He's out on the road. Well, you screwed up again, Todd. Okay. And you know something we're getting sick and tired of it. Okay. We're not going to beg you to come in here and eat. Laura's going to eat all the food that you would have eaten, Todd. He's already grown enough. Don't you think? Yeah. Yeah. It's time to stun his growth. Work to do. I don't know what's going on. Good. Well, they're not going to do anything. I don't want to do so. Boy, this is good, bone. It's great. And this is unusual. Boone must be in a really generous mood today because usually he don't come in and sit down here and waste all his time. Putting all these plates together for everybody. I know. Yeah. Looks like they don't even do this at Sadie's buffet, do they? Oh wow. Oh, they're no number. Uh-huh. Yeah. They do hold a number. The coconut milk soup is outrageous. Is there any more soup? Oh yeah. Yeah. Who's going to try the soup? Laura will try the soup. What kind of is that? Is that the hot and sour? Yeah. The hot and sour and coconut milk soup. The guy from the front. I understand. Where's the, oh, there's two of them, right? Oh, you got more of it in there? The coconut milk soup trust me is so good. That you're just, I'm just saying that. I mean, you guys don't have to try it, but good luck to you if you don't. Anyway, that's almost going to kill a first hour. But of course, we do have a celebrity collar as our final collar with the hour. Wow. I'll tell you that curry pop is as good as sex. It's not better. Yeah. And in your case, probably a hell of a lot better. Why just mung done my shirt? I can't believe it. Well, that's all right. All right. You know, I never met a guy that smiles as much as food and does. You notice that? Mm-hmm. You don't get that look on his face. Yeah. I noticed mostly sneaky people smile a lot. No. The window who this is. Oh, he does. I'm in shock. Right. Yeah. Even bull nose is driving. We've got to have a chronic party at food and place. We've got to do one Friday. That's a good idea. Yeah, I think it'll be great. All the people who never show off. We can get berry upsteen there. We can get veggie from Boka. There you go. Everybody except the guy in his dog. Oh, no. He's, um, he's cooling out. Okay. Good friend. All right. I just wanted to say hi and say hi, boo. We'll probably see him in the weekend. What? Is this like an honor of my mentioning your name yesterday? Is that what this is all about? I have to be answered. I missed his show yesterday. Yeah. Uh-huh. No. We were shooting yesterday. So I wasn't in the office. Shooting. What? What's it good? What you said? Oh, what's the day? No. It was very positive. What you saying? I said you could even call in. What's about his positive is we get with you. You must have been feeling good. No. I was under the weather. That's why I said that in our home of weakness. Okay. Have a wonderful weekend. I'm seeing him. Okay. Well, I had to say look at this. Boy, we've really got quite a gathering in here, isn't it? Why? This is shocking. Anyway, that's going to do it for this hour. Boy, shouldn't I have the music ready? You know what? I'm really screwing up. Just don't get carried away, Roger. Give me one moment to see if I can find it. Here it is. We got a little special introduction for Henry and the 11 o'clock. Oh, great. He was just a second. This is worth waiting. One moment, please. Absolutely. Absolutely. Okay. Adding a little touch of class to the WI-1100 clock news cast and then we'll come back at 1105. Steve is doing that blockbuster video disgrace at 2 this afternoon. It'll make care of growing places that you wouldn't believe. It's 1105 at WI-O-D and we really cleaned this stuff out today. Didn't we? Do you have a spoon? Well, if you don't have a spoon, we got a lot of spoons and the thing there. Roger's got spoons. We got it all here. Don't worry about it. Are you going to be all right now? You look a little. It was fairly reasonable, wasn't it? You're good music, huh? Okay. Not too bad. We've seen worse. Yeah. Now we had considering the tremendous business that we did in here. It was fairly, yeah. Yeah. It was. Excuse me. We've seen worse. Well, I would discuss it. Anyway, it's 1106 at WI-O-D. Look at that. They're even cleaning the table up here. It's just, what a job you guys did today. Incredible. And of course Todd was not in here today. I'm getting, you know, it gets old. You know, I'm saying these guys that want to be out there working when they're supposed to be in here reading lunch. So if he comes in here fetching that he didn't get fed, I don't want to hear about it. Okay. What he wants to be on the air? Well, I thought he'd be playing baseball by now. Listen, I found some time in between my rotisserie league and baseball game. You really want to admit this on the air? Who to advise you that the city council of plantation not, and to prove your satellite dish. They approved it. And you'll be able to watch yourself all the way into Cub Heaven. Really? Well, last now and cry later, the Cubs are in better shape than the Dodgers norm. It's all in contonia. Yes. And they seem to me that we beat her shiver twice through that I dream that I met somebody on the elevator of my building the other day who was just dancing in the elevator because he said the Cubs are in first place and it's almost June 1. A game in a half, by the way, the Met's lost yesterday. Just mentioned that in passing, a game in a half. Well, he said that it's a thrill for the Cubs to be in first place because he knows it won't lie. Well, he's full of it. Okay. Well, I was, we got, as long as we got Mitch Williams in Shawn, Dunston were a great shape. Well, of course, who would there go to the plate knowing Mitch Williams is, I mean, that's correct. We have to wear a batting helmet. That's right. But, back to the very, even Harry Wars, a helmet when Mitch Williams comes in. By the all-starb rate, the Met will be constantly in Wisconsin's first place because we'll be looking up. You will be lamenting the fact that you have to deal with another Ridley summer in the second division. Isn't it a shame that Norm Culledon and humiliated and disgraced himself out here? Like this today. I bet you're going to be getting a lot of letters about this call. I wouldn't have it any other way. Okay. Govern yourself accordingly. Take care. See you later. Okay. It's 1108, the WIOD, the City of Plantation is approved by this. Everything is wonderful and kosher. And I thank Norm and I thank Chuck over at Telstar has been a real battle. But once they saw what it was, there's no problem. I mean, it's like, you know, what's it? Okay, we're locked in approval. No. No. So we had Paul Harvey Jr. before the news. Norm can't after the news. And we had Barry Epstein. Oh, one. In the first hour, don't forget about Barry. Okay. That happens. Boy, this is a taste. So good. Yeah. Everything is great. That's, I think he puts some like, you know, we got some cash you chicken today. It's like peanut butter or something. I don't know. What's Henry looking for? What is that? What is that? I don't want to say what it looks. Ha ha ha ha ha. I'm making customers with good things. Oh, that's your wife made. Really? What's it got a little colloy in it, too? No, conniac. Oh, conniac. Yeah, I should have known. Well, thank you so much. And if I'm not here Monday, you folks will know the reason why. Okay. It's nine minutes past eleven at Wild. Henry's in here. Now look at that. The only thing is they're left. They're all liquid. Isn't that great? That's why he's got a big smile on his face. Here's a mobile and browner. Hello. Hello. Great. It's just I had to tell you the little bit of misinformation about the cups. We spent a couple of days in Chicago this weekend, of course, the cups are added to our own. But listening to you over the past couple of months, I've come to when I thought the people, I will give them spoken of like the cups suck and so on and so forth. And I made that little mistake of saying that somebody in Chicago this weekend almost got myself killed. Yeah. They are absolutely going crazy up there. The town is not over the cups. They've got a lot of stock. They sure do. Just want to let you know that. Okay. Thanks a lot. How do you like that? They're all excited up there. Are they? Now great. The bulls, the cubs, black cocks had a big year. I'm excited. I never liked Chicago. Anyway, it's the ten minutes past eleven at Wild. We have an open line in Broward 524Wild. This is going to be like yesterday. Remember we ate early? Good. We put it behind it. We had good. Yeah. And then we could have do a shakerial show. And the guys in the newsroom and all these other people showed up because it was payday. They did a excellent job. That's right. That's right. They were so busy. We're here. We don't get it. And they zipped out. They got their food. Everybody was on a bed. They only talked about a very low decibel tone. Yeah. And the boom was shoveling that food out there. Like Grant took Richmond. It was really. Yeah. We liked that. We didn't do it early. Get it out of the way. Then we do a radio show. We kind of sit back. We just did all. Yes. Oh. Well, this was great. And even Harry Brudel deserved from home. And we got those custard. Yeah. Why do I feel like I'm eating so much more than I usually do when boom comes? I feel like I'm eating a lot. This is lighter. lighter. Now. Whatever you say boom. No, I'm wondering, bro. I should have that pornographic magazine. What a wonderful birthday present. That was really talk about unique and different. Yeah. Right. It was definitely. Especially that blonde Chinese woman. Oh, man. That was interesting. Never saw anything like it. It's 11 past 11 at WIOD. Toyota of Hollywood is making deals. I've been telling you that are just could be the chance of a lifetime. And if you think I'm exaggerating just to get you in there, you're wrong because Card dealers as you know are trying like crazy. Everything under the sun to get people to come on in right now and buy. Because things are a little on the slow side. It's a little bit of the doldrum days. You know what I'm saying? The dold days. But Toyota of Hollywood as you know, always has the lowest prices. And now they've got gigantic factory rebates on top of which they're slashing even extra chunks off the prices on a sticker of virtually every car in a lot. So if you're in the market to buy or trade or if you thought you were going to do it in a couple of months, maybe give a second thought to go in and looking around right now because you're never going to get a better deal than the ones that are waiting for you right now at Toyota of Hollywood. Don't forget you got just a few days left to take advantage of the May service department special oil change builder 25. safety check on everything from brake tires, hoses, etc. All of that only $9.95 when you mention the arrages in WIOD at Toyota of Hollywood on 441 between Taft and Sheridan streets in Hollywood. It's 137 at WIOD. Steve is doing his ill advised blockbuster video debate this afternoon, which I just, I think he's wrong. I really do, I think he's dead wrong. They got every other movie that's ever been invented and they got one that almost nobody wants to see and he's got all these poor suckers out there, these sickle fans who are cutting up their cards and sending them in. And he can get all the, you feel that he wants from what he's other places. In fact, I heard through the grapevine and it had another bag in there. Yeah, the bag man they call him yellow bag. So I don't, but anyway, it's a one-buster food. There it is. Look at that. Another rent on the yellow bag. Oh man. But anyway, the revert, the right revert. The revert, the revert, the revert of the house name is John Cox. He's going to be here to explain why they don't carry the last temptation of Christ's video and create a whole service about that. Red of that. Revere in Cox, not done, Cox, revert in Cox. Maybe he's related. I won't ask. Don't start talking about Don Cox, because he'll call in again. He is so boring when he calls in on his show. He's a wonderful guy, but he is so boring. God. Look at that. We just, as you mentioned, his name, the collar and the go. Drop right off the line. To seven eight W.I.N.D. and Boca here is a filled Beckman in Hollywood. Another former radio superstar. That's it. I want to say one thing. I really enjoyed that Rickshaw air check that you play the latest one What's in that grade? Fucking a dream lover. Yeah. I think I may have to get that out here. Yeah, that's my favorite. Is that from 1959 or is it during the interview now? Well, I really don't know, but we'll have to check the date on it. Probably early. I had a night in the middle of the summer for you from last hour. I guess now. I would think it probably was from when dream lover was out, which about 61. I would say, I think 1959, believe it or not. Was it? Yeah. Thirty years ago. I was not the circle. You know, you mentioned that they were managed by Brian Epstein. They were also where the opening act of the Beatles in their last tour. Really? They and Bobby Hebba, the Ron Hetzel opened for the Beatles and it cost you $4.0.0.0.0.0. By the way, speaking of the Ron Hetzel, if anybody at our friends inspects or anybody is got any Ron nettap. Not a man? Yeah. There's a reason. Why? There's a guy named Alan Klein who is the manager of, who is the manager of Abko Industries. It tied up the Beatles stuff or so long. Messed up the Rolling Stones stuff or so long. It's now involved with the Phil Spector stuff. That's why I can't find it. It was within a month of release and he got involved in it and put the whole thing on hold. Isn't that a good idea? I mean, Brian. I've been scouring looking for a Phil Spector CD. All those great Phil Spector Philadelphia groups, you know, the Ron Hetzel and all the others. I can't find any. Brian O'Head, like an eight or nine set of CD's retrosteck of a Phil Spector's career was almost to the printing plant, the pressing plant and it got held up. I don't know how long it's going to take. Shocking. I don't know. I don't know the thing about popsicles and icicles. I don't know if it has the writers credit on it, but David Gates have bread wrote that song. Are you serious? It's just for success. Wow. For you are just full of it. And one more little handy telephone tip for those of the suits that have that call waiting before they call it a dial star seven. Oh, they wouldn't get that poppin and click in all the time which sounds like he'll come. Yeah, that's right. And that's it. Well, you're sure of the. Well, I always enjoy your show and I'm glad I got it. Oh, by the way, all right. Well, one more thing that toss an attorney you were talking about. Yeah. You want to hear the original master tape version of it with a longer intro and mind-blowing stereo. Look for the baby boomer disc stock poppin six teeth. You will really like that. That one. Right. That one. Let me ask you a question. Yeah. Who else in the world could have had that in the machine? And played it as you were describing, okay? That's all that got the dirty Morepsis on. And you know, any Morepska owns the record company that the on used to record for a Larry record. Yeah. Yeah. But it's the shocking. It is. Is not fact anybody that's walking around with this much information in their minds about trivia and music could be dangerous. Well, I like to think that. Okay. Keep up the good work. Thanks a lot, Phil. Alright. It's too bad he couldn't use any of that when he was on street. Well, the audience that she was too stoned to understand it. Baby. Listen to this. Baby. You did something to me. I couldn't sleep at all. I never heard that. Well, never. Yeah. So you want to hear that on GTR, okay? Because there are a bunch of douche bags over here next door. Alright? So crank it up and piss off our neighbors that's the original. Great. Yeah? We'll show them. Exactly. But your fakers, GTR. I thought I took a walk in the dark. It's $1.42 a WOD with all the hits all the time. We got Yankee baseball tonight. Oh yeah. Oakland at New York. Well, that ought to be a disaster for the Yankee, huh? They won one last night. What time? It's a $7.30 to contusion. Even? Yeah. $7.30 even, right, $2.00 to the bitter end is they say the Yankee Stadium. $7.43 a WOD will be right back. Oh, no. Nice. That will shock you. That Ricky's up pretty quickly. Oh, we had Jay Michaels here to do this. We'd really have it made, wouldn't we? Yeah. Yeah. That Jay. Don't say it. Right. How do you tell him for the weekend, so I wouldn't be right to be singing Stan Major. We'd be wrong. We're really brings back some memories of that. It sure does. Oh yeah. That Jay Michaels ban. If you Dr. Vazacollas today during the lightning round briefly, two or three seconds. They've just been fishing at Chuan Medain. Is that flounder? Waspombie, Chelo? Yeah, near the top from West Palm Beach. Yeah, Todd. Yeah, I figured a top of Carlson's shirt. You're missing Todd then. Well, we've had it with Todd. You know, he's got some going out working. Probably supposed to be eating. He's got this business all confused, you know. He got it all wrong. Dorothy's got him on a wrong foot. Okay. I'm still reeling from the last few college. You had to have a dean, private, the guy in the barn. All that we wouldn't get into that one. Yeah. Oh my God. Are you in here all of that call with Jared Mosta? Were you on hold during that call? Yeah, well, you heard all of that. He didn't all make it on the air. No, one of you would just a little bit too limp-rusted even for me. Oh my God. You are reeling. Yeah, I was. What's happening down there? Oh. But, and I got that story for you. Okay. Quick, when I went to the dog's last night, I know you hate the dogs. I didn't say I hate the dogs, but once it was. You know, you're miserable. I see here. I went all heavy chalk and I just clung. Well, first of all, anybody who's going to, you know, cry about going heavy chalk. I've told you, fooling as money are soon parted, beating chalk. Okay. Throw the chalk out. Oh, well, I hate the dogs who just keep an impungeon on the rails and it's horrible. It was a very dismal. I was just in, where was this in Palm Beach? Yeah, Palm Beach can't play. Well, that'll teach you to begin with. Oh, to, well, what should have come back on to this game? Oh, and that's what a drive. See, this game had little, they had an even money shot in a first race. 56, 20 in the second. I'm going to do the horses next to you. Here's a $40 dog in a seventh race. So they had a little something for everybody. I've given up on the, on the dogs. I'm going to do the horses next year. I am. Yeah. What called are open zone Monday? I don't really, I thought it was, I thought it was closing down. No, highly a close zone. Oh, yeah. Call are open zone money. This is obviously a gentleman who's really, really into very much in tune with the horses and dogs. And they're not mutual expert. I think you should go buy some lottery tickets myself. This is that, no way. You can, you know, what you got better odds, making money, yeah, looking into your couch pillows. You're so f***ing making money. Right. That's it. Well, one time, quala, never listen to you. Okay. I love your show. Good luck, Tesser. Have a good one, buddy. The sense of humor like yours, you ought to go really far. It's easy. Yeah. It sure is. Easy for you to say. I think he's cute up again. By far, the most significant problem facing man today is the production of food and fiber to meet the necessities of life. No one sounds like the post. I like that. I saved your wreck. Yeah. Saved you from a disaster. Here I'm leaving you. Somehow, bro. You gotta play a whole thing for a killback, buddy. And boy, do you? Yeah, remember he asked. He said it's his favorite. Oh, that whole thing. You'll get to that. What I'm good in the radio, okay, Phil? I wonder if Ricky could talk this one up. He asked. He asked. Tell me if you can decide on the land. Ooh. It's a 10 till 12 in WOD. It seems like we've been here for hours today. Is it a hot, almighty? Yesterday went by like lightning. It was sat down and got up and left. But today, it seems like we've been here on a marathon. Yeah, yeah. It seems like it's got to be at least two, three and a half to noon. I got to get home and see the cubs game. Who's pitching for the cubs today, by the way? Can I ask that without you getting hysterical? Because it only take us couple of seconds. I would think, boleki, would be my guess. The M2s have become a lot more tolerant. Well, you have to. You don't have any choice. Let's see. Missionally, mailer and Kilgis. Oh, Jay's. That big fat Rick Mailer who we couldn't hit at all on Sunday. And Paul Kilgis, who's like, oh. So like I said, we'll just take our time. And if I get home and find it, if not that's okay too. Is there anything else on here? This is a good one. Okay, this is good for all these radio rumors that we've been having last couple of weeks. I mean there's no discussion of situations of events, of social problems, anything else. It's just a dark and radio. Even with a so-called food cirrhosis that currently have been just takes in the Western world. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. That was on three separate cards. Okay, that could have been in the Guinness Book of Records. That was the first radio talk up on three separate cards and he hit it. May 26th, 1989. 11th, 15th. Mark is from MGM Studios in Orlando, it says. This must be a joke, Phil. No, it's no joke. I'm sitting here. You can hear the music, can't you? Yeah. Here anything? What? You're hearing music? Yeah. Oh, well, anyway, I'm sitting here on my mobile phone in MGM Studios and I got back from Dominican Republic about a week and a half ago. And a month and jail for playing your tape on the radio. Yeah, but you did. Yeah, no, seriously. I sent you a letter. I don't know if you got it. I gave you those cigars that when I got back. Are you serious? You spent a month in jail for what? Playing your tape on the beach during the Easter weekend cause the riots. No. Yes, sir. What are you talking about? Well, I sent you a letter to explain the whole thing, but I guess. I got this a gars. Oh, yeah. Those are gars. In fact, I got some in my briefcase here. Boy, those will just rent your guts out. Wow. I've got a nickel of peas. Now, seriously, you spent a week in jail for what? Well, I was playing that ponder's tape. You made that Tuesday of the riots in Miami when you were talking about burning down their own houses in their own neighborhoods. It's better and so on. Yeah. I was playing that and somebody overheard it. And since I was only a wait person on the beach, I was a crowd developed around me and I don't know if they were waiting for me to die there on the beach or whatever. But some guy came by and said, I was a full-mitten riot and some people... Well, making a riot? Yeah, because this guy didn't speak English, but he heard fire and then riot and all this other stuff. And he thought it was a propaganda tape for an agent for rocket stuff. Yeah. Oh, there he go. Here to music? Yeah, I sure do. Ladies, real life-reaching people here. Oh, they just set up right behind me. Oh, this guy. Oh, I don't see one. No wonder you were in jail. You might get arrested for this cop. Oh, you're real life-head. I'm not lying. I hate my public. Set up right behind me. Yeah. Did you, uh, anyway, huh? Yeah, I am. And with real life- I think you are, yeah. Real life-reaching people. I don't see a gray hair and sight. That's great. The land of the lies. I tried to rent a space on a space shuttle to get the hell out of here. But they didn't have any room and they weren't taking off. But I think I'll just let you live in a music if you like. Okay. Oh, uh-huh. I know. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Oh, uh-huh. Wow. That was a park out there. Was that a car? Was that a car? Wow. What a car. He oughta be in jail. That's 559463. That's the Palm Beach number and you can get on that line where we just had the Phil... What was it called? I don't know. Phil Beckman Jr. I think from Orlando. Why? That was incredible. God, that was Phil Beckman Jr. My amy, hello. And you? Yeah, yeah, done. Okay. It's funny, call you. Sunny. Sunny hurts. Oh, uh, the game is tonight, isn't it? No, no, I just wanted to be called. No. When from the call, you have to say... You think I'm going to dig that CD out again? Go through all that, your dreamer. That was funny. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. How about a suggestion for Monday? Yeah. You guys going to be there, number one? Sure. Okay. In fact, uh, Arnold's role castle burgers come by with food on Monday on a holiday no less. All right, Arnold. Because they never close. They don't. They never. They're going to be there on 7th Avenue. Yeah, in the hundred twenty-fifth? Yeah, but I work right down the street. Say, um, well, it's a suggestion for the landing or for the for Monday. Maybe having expanded lightning around or with deputy to tremendous. Yeah, for four hours. Yeah. That'd be outstanding. Well, maybe for three and a half. We got to get the important stuff on first. There could be some important rumors and things, you know. Yeah, oh, yeah. I'm sure there will be. Mm-hmm. You never know. I, uh, that one got a good last call. I'm just going to sleep. I've been a whole little long here. Now, when he was good, right? I almost had a radio, uh, fatality. Yeah, well, we're going to have him put away again. And the other guy, but the earlier one, whatever that was, they called about the, the tight pants on the other. Where another pair of tight pants as long as I live. I got scared just thinking about that. Yeah. I was thinking, you know, Todd, who is our intern in the newsroom. He's wearing all these loose pants. I, uh, one thing I'm glad that short here is backing. Because I don't like that long collishes here down to your waist. I think it's disgusting. But I thought loose pants were out now. Aren't they? Are we going back to tight pants? I hope so. Like skin tight, quarter-oil. Sure, sure. Okay, I just mentioned that in passing, Todd. I kind of when you walk, you make a little noise as you walk. Exactly. Right. And those who are looking at you make a little noise too. You can use the hair right behind you. Not too close. Hey, you know, the circle? Yeah. They came from Lafayne College in Eastern Pennsylvania. That's right. You're going to hang out. You're going to go. Yeah, they were college students. A pretty exclusive school. It's a nice school. You know, Easter, Eastern Pennsylvania, which is an Eastern part of Pennsylvania, about 60 miles at the Delaware from Philadelphia. And they were college students there and they had that hit and then they dropped out of school. Yeah. And they went down to the early 60s. And then what? That's all. I don't know. I didn't know them that well. I just went that up here for 30 parties where they used to play. You know, like a group. Yeah, they had two big hits. Yeah, the Red River ball and out when they disappeared. Never to be heard from again. Yeah, they were from, I think they're from Connecticut and up that area. There were a lot of guys came to school there. Wait a minute. I thought you just said they were from Pennsylvania. Yeah, well, that's the school they went to. Oh, they went to school in Pennsylvania. But they were from Connecticut. I think so. I'm not sure. They've been from Pennsylvania, which is an Eastern Pennsylvania. Yeah. They were from Western Connecticut, like hard food. Yeah. I got a lot of it. No. They went to what? The Lafayette College. Oh, yeah. The Leopard. Mm-hmm. And up. Oh, hey, don't let it throw you know. I'm losing my mind there. Yeah. We're trying to get you to do talk up for the first time. Okay. And he stepped on. I did it for you. Oh, he stepped on it. Well, have a nice day, Patty. You gave your bet. Good. Wow. I did it for him. I helped him right up to the post there. Oh, awesome. And he stepped on it. Mm. Potetic. It's not a professional. But it goes back to what we always say. You shouldn't have brought away those French Canadians, man. You deserve to lose the Stanley Cup. Okay. They were, they were shring over old Canada again last night. From the minute the guy started singing it, they were screaming and puking and yelling. And it gets louder and they're the most obnoxious rude bastards that ever came down the pike. Amen. And they got beat. They got the Stanley Cup right there in Montreal. You know what? And it made me really pleased. Oh, anybody who screams over old Canada should be shot. Exactly. Stored. Here's a call from Stuart. Oh, not Stuart. I thought it was. Yes. Yeah. All right. How many Stuart calls do you think we had? And the beat. I didn't hear you say anything. Oh, I see. Listen, I'm coming down to Hioliet, I'm borrowing. I'm going to plunge my brain out. You got any hot ones for me. I don't have tomorrow's entries. Shoot. Yeah. I'd bring a safety pin if I were you, okay? This is close. I'm serious. Just close your eyes. Don't buy a racing form. Just get a program. Bring a safety pin. Close your eyes and do it for all 10 races. Okay. I turn out better. I'm telling you, that's the way to do it. Go ahead. We just picked these names out of the paper. We got an incredible banning average. We've been betting higher than Mitch Webster. That's tough. Who's some hot jockey, or whatever? Hot jockey, shove as Gonzalez, Valiente, Pedro Rodriguez, Laura Peremsky, Joe Baggetton, there you go. All right. And then you got those two simultaneous races from Belmont, okay? All right. So you can plunge your brains out on Chris Antley and get beat. Sounds like a loser. You'll have a good time. Trust me. Just go against your basic instincts. You oughta do real well. Thanks, Neil. Okay. Good luck to you. Bye. Okay. Okay. We got a plate part of the right one. Aren't you confused? Yes. Very well. The pressure is just building. So April gets ready for the news in there. I know. You did it. You did it. They're well. And that's going to be it for the 11 o'clock hour. Got it. Seems like we've been there for at least 15 or 20 hours. That's not enough. Giving new meaning to the word ponderous pour. This has been just incredible. It's been awesome, but it's been ponderous. April does have the sensuous exclusive 12 o'clock Wiod News. We'll come back in 12 o'clock. Steve with his big blockbuster show at 2 o'clock. Afterno. More than you ever dreamed you would know about the circle. High ladies and gentlemen. I ready to broadcast. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. I love myself. Now I've got to tell you. We owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to Steve Stanceel over at GTR because why? 97. What is that? He won? Put it on the screen. I can't read Laura's lips. Laura's. She's got something to say about everybody who breeds in the building. He broke his nose. Who's Stanceel? How do you do that? He broke his nose. Playing. Batchy ball. By softball. Yeah, well that's a GTR softball team. Oh. And if you saw those trends that came out, they didn't only lose in softball. Anyway, nobody did that cart. And it just fits in with everything. I mean, there isn't a record. There might be one record. Can I play it? Yeah. It could be this could be tough. I was going to say there isn't a record that's been made that that particular cart will not do that. Yeah. Well, this could be it, really. Are these the ones that have the different cuts? No, I think God, they put the same cuts on the front. The numbers on the front. Weird. As they head on the back. Why would they do that? And it's amazing because it's the same. It's the billboard series. But what's the one they got carried away? And they got different numbers because they want to do a scotch shorts in and playing softball. Isn't that something? Laura's God. Hit Steve Stancell playing softball because Steve made some in temperate remark about Laura and her very tiny eyes. Or something like that. So it says there's one less suitor. Well, I would say that Steve Stancell is not a bad looking guy. In fact, he's probably the only guy over a GTR looks human. Isn't he? He's not that he's pretty good looking guy. Right? Yeah. Laura says he's okay by me. He says now and Glenn Wilson. Glenn Wilson. Glenn Wilde. Well, that's Glenn Drobot. Yeah. Well, Glenn's. What's he looking at? He's not a he's a fact. I was very cute. Laura says Glenn Wilde is very cute. Do you think he's very cute? Never thought of it. No, I never thought he was cute. I think that Ross is cute. Okay. And Todd would be a lot of cuter if he'd come and and stop doing all those jobs on the outside. Yeah. Hi ladies and gentlemen. I'm ready to ride jazz. I love myself. That's not good. I'm gonna be a hea. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Not bad. Yeah. He did it. That's bad. Okay. It's 12. 21 to WIOD. We do have an open line in Broward at 5.24. WIOD. Guess we're getting the second race today with Phil Saltman. Oh, Calilated with Rodriguez is my pick out of desperation. I don't have any idea. The Harold's not there anymore. The sports. Sure. Sure. And Sharon came in and messed with our old one. I have it here. You got Willie's folly in the ninth race with Valiente. Yeah. She left me this. She left me this. She left me this. The sports. Okay. Let me take a look and see just how bad my pick is. He's also 61 in a Harold morning line, but they got just beware with Castillo is the best bed of the day. And nobody picks. Oh, Calilated. Well, what the name like then, I think it. Because that's horse country up there, you know? Yes, that's true. So we just a stab in a dark. We'll give Phil another excuse to call in today. Because he's desperate. That's the best. He is desperate to be heard by somebody other than the 4,500 people of Hi, Alia. Miami. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. Is this the pet shop? Yeah. What can we do for you? Oh, yeah. Can you do a new bird or something, sir? I think. How are you doing? Me? What's happening? Isn't this the pet store? Yeah. It is. Oh, yeah. Give um. It's the 20 to I have to do it. I know. It's W-W-D. We have an open line in there. We're captain Retardo just hung up at 751-9463. Miami. Hello. I knew how are you today. Great. I got a W-I-O-D spy report. Do you? Last night on the King Show. What's the question? He got a call as usual and it played a tape of you talking to Glenn and Roger about that. By the way, I need a soda. If anybody who had we had 400 people had lunch in here today. A diet Pepsi would be wonderful. I just mentioned that in passing. And it takes more than a minute. You'll never eat here again. Go ahead, sir. So they played a tape of you with discussing when Donald Trump told Larry his breath stinks. Oh, yeah. And you said Roger and Roger said, yeah, I sort of show. So King goes. I don't know who that is, but whoever it is, he wants to be me. They can spell it as well. When is they get the name right? It's okay. And then he proceeds to say, I was misquoted. The Donald Trump didn't say my breath. He said, I was sitting too close to you. So, I knew you'd get a kick out of here. Listen to this. Oh, God. And King goes to the guy. He goes, I keep getting this cross from Miami and they're playing this guy. I've never heard of him. I have no idea who he is. He must be somebody who wants to be me. Everybody wants to be me. Superstar. Yeah. So when that happened, I just went through real fun. I couldn't believe it. I said, yeah, he wants to be.
