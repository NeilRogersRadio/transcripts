The time-breaking quote is 12-08 at WIOD. Let's try Bokka on the Palm Beach line. But you're right. Oh, there is somebody there. Yes. Hi. How you doing? Hello? Yeah, how are you? Fine. I just wanted to say I enjoy your show. I want to also cross through to my two cents about the news media. I feel that they create a lot of our problems that we have today because they're so insistent about the new act like Barbie dolls. They can possibly know what tragedy is to an individual. Uh-huh. And why I'm on and why I want to also say who is laughing? This is last, you know, we might be able to wzele. Yeah, we're going to play him down. You know how you listen to someone and you try to picture what they look like. But the last just drives me crazy. Well, that's the WIOD weasel, as a matter of fact. Uh-huh. Is it really? Yeah. Oh, sure. No problem. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah, she knows a lot about it. That's for sure. Maybe you'll. Yeah. A couple of something. Um, listen to you guys for a long time. You guys are hilarious. Yes, we are. We're a panic. Really? Yeah. Would you explain to the other lady? No, no, no. Let's go ahead. Don't. Every you got to make a big difference. She just takes your guts. Go ahead, sir. Yeah, what was very going to say? He wants to start a big argument with me. I want to say I don't want to argue. I just wanted to ask this nice man if he would explain to her who I am. The Weasel. That's it. Well, you're a good sidekick, but you're off the soft skin. I don't know how to do it. Yeah, I'm still. I was trying to keep you all these. I'm here. I'm going to ask you a shot up and let this guy go on. We don't have a lot of time here. We've got important stuff to do. I think the car's network is saving itself six digits by just getting an endless loop of words to laugh and even to warrant their zone. So you had to start with this. You know what you're well on. No, Glenn, you're a great guy. You really are. I've gotten a lot of your remotes. Man, I think the most recent one I went to was down at Stacks. Uh-huh. That's right. Great. You were. The great. It was a great remotes. And I was down on the friend of mine who I'm going to call it due spag and second. But one thing I couldn't believe was how tight you guys are with the food. Well, where we don't talk with the food. I mean, Pat Rich had to be strictly removed from the ice cream. Yeah. But, um, how? It damn their children. I like that that Rich got ripped too. Yeah. And if he thinks he lost 70 pounds, tell him I found him. Okay. Well, listen and closing. No, one more thing. Um, probably closing. If I have to close now, me called Jim and Beaves in Adam and Mike.
