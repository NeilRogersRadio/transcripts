and beat that jade or me you and beat that jade or me 10.03.05.60. WQM happy when they to you what is this obsession in this town with college sports and I'm only college sports but college how far would you say this about 300 miles to go into the right number of in there more or 300 miles it's about 400 miles to Jackson though it can't be okay like 300 miles away the stuff that's going on here does anybody care about that but gains will men are obsessed with gains will maybe we need to get an education here maybe we need to practice some people a lot about the gators who can I saw a license tag I'm going to get my mail last night and my fourth door for the fox and as a guy in front of me he's got a one of the specialized license tag with a picture of a gator on it and it says no no a picture of a seminal of things no gators with the thing no gator don't you want to like stick your finger kind of like in your nose I mean because every time I see either steaks for your or Bobby Bob I mean forget about Terry Bob need to get something he saw picture of himself on TV with a white shirt in the baseball camp and he said I'm so dead and bears I got to get out of here and he just ran off and quit he'll all dance and quit but what is it about college sports in this town I mean I thought this was like an sports day because I see a piece of mail a Greg Reid got this morning which thank God he shared with me because we like to know when he end his near and it says get rid of me or Rogers we want sports on the time of course no signature no return nothing get rid of me or Rogers we want sports we even know his ratings are like double anybody else on the station you realize that or do we get a response on that where the attend to two numbers are yet well by now let's get rid of it over there okay it's Wednesday already to book him out on Friday let's get those ten to two numbers so we have our only a number of these four hours and we can see here in Greg about him how great they are like kind of morning drive and afternoon drive put together in some demographics and bring it in more money making more money than any other day part but let's get rid of you because he don't want to talk sports and he is afraid for you don't want to talk about that most picking data crap and seminal crap and we're going to send a big black guy way to we're going to send him out why he's going to run like a mother scratch and we're going to fill him to ball and we're going to score score and I mean get serious will you please so I noticed in the course when I do talk sports there's no response anyway because I talk about a real sport like hockey which we got the game with the redweights tonight and we got a thousand unsolved tickets for that including the 500 Panther facts so please let's fill that you enough I heard Gordon Murphy on with the worst thing this morning I was going Gordon good guy very articulate actually said something that was a part of the thing that basically no cause there was I'm short to call that about some dolphin and not trade your attention but somebody else I never heard of and that was it some show but there wasn't any of the discussion about the situation with the Whitney which he may not play on a second line we understand that he does you know who to thank for that I understand that Terry Murray was having big jogging and movements yesterday during the course of his show see this day one of those places where you can run even if we get no response to it like I said they had no calls about that this morning and they were going on an on a great line about the benching with Whitney and Spala and about Terry Murray being a hard ass and they had Gordon Murphy on there today have one call about that although he has all the folks got it who is getting out that get out Jelby's goat which I think is the one the Terry and Brian Murray were photographed and started a jitter stuff and here they come one after another after another with one finger in their nostril one in their echo and start with a jitter crab and here we are in Miami here it's interesting the one call I did here was to go to set up there on Gainesville radio they don't talk about their heroculars they talk about the gators they talk about what they're doing up there we're sitting out in the same conference you know what what's the big deal what's the attraction but because we have so many people down here who have been this fortunate going to school up there see I went to a school where we have a crappy football team Michigan State we had a couple of good years you know 60 seven and a couple of good years along the way over the years but you know something is anybody really care all that much and there's plenty of corruption in plenty of a scandal and plenty of illiterate to a jocks up there but there's anybody really care and went to Michigan State with them team losers are not we got a great hockey team so do we care about the fact that our football team socks go and then Michigan year in and year out like this year almost every year beats just not out of us we beat no today in this year oh you go that's our plan the family don't need to the way of things else but these people at go to school at some college and right away to become obsessed with a football team obsessed like it to be placed most up to do for a life I don't get it I don't understand it that sports talking has not not professional sports college sports I'm going to tell you something maybe we can actually work down to a meaningful level we can start talking high school sports how about junior high sports how about gender gardens for a ride there's a kid over there plays a Miami high about seven years old baby he's got to be he's growing he's about six to already six years old six to farm like a moose and we're going to sit him out there he's going to go out wide and he's going to run like a mother's going to run at God damn craft and they're going to have to think up there they're going to do a hell Mary it's unbelievable and don't you think it's a humble right do it's amazing to me the grown people that adults are so obsessed and so and just so full of like psychosis about this like it's important to be able to do it like a future of the world depends on leader football or seminal football or her crew football depending on who got the biggest you know chose this year stuff like that there's not what it really is all about who's got the biggest pose because I'm going to tell you Steve Spirier and Bobby Bob you put the two of them together and you still have minus points in the IQ column yeah who every time I see those guys yeah who that's what comes to mind I think of the things that are wrong with the state of Florida not the things that are nice about or like the weather most of the time like those nice pretty palm trees stuff like that but I think of the things that are wrong when I see those guys what kind of yeah that my finger all the way up to where my brain used to be in fact maybe that's what happened maybe they had their finger up there so much where the brain used to be to kind of scratched it out when and out of kind of fell out you know what I'm talking about I think you do nine minutes where you eight out that catering you're just having some hysterical lunatic on the phone which I wish we could have gotten them on the fact that I discuss sports therefore I'm a hypocrite I discuss sports I talk about hockey which is a level above all of the sports in a class by itself how about that game last night even though was a scoreless talk okay not college football which is for overgrown children I mean how why don't we talk about college soccer how about LaCrosse cover big and colleges up there in the Ivy League they play LaCrosse how about college golf huh college swimming college diving that's what Greg Lucena said we said divers do it deeper that's what he said look what happened to him I mean let's you know get into the nitty gritty that's the problem with this time you don't hear it like during the marlin's thing this year I mentioned this yesterday is there any intelligence discussion about baseball hey Eddie you think Lee Bosn's going to win 20 games this year that's a lot of the conversation you got about baseball on this time this might be odd to think if we had real sports fan in this town and people be screaming about this they'd be having a nervous breakdown and by the way the met's only paid 30 million dollars more for the whole deal in the next high stopper smart move their mix but do we have any comment about that? oh no they talk about college sports that's and anyone with a due talk is caca nonsense oh my school better nearer is indifa where do you go to school? you're some kind of a seminal oh my god you're some kind of a her tone that's not sports that's caca that's baby crap that's uh like that so the the notion that I'm the evil one on here there must be a reason that all these people are tuned in like the guy that was screaming to you that claims he's going back to changes radio right now who listens every single god damn day and his worst thing is i speak right now but doesn't have the car horns to call and speak to me it wants to be rate you because he's such a macho man he's probably god damn gator if he asks me and you know something the gators the seminal's and her teens they can all kiss my big fat rectum that'll give a crap about any of them except I do like to see the her cones lose I do like that I'll confess to that I was very very sad when Dave Lamal was shrieking and yelling and screaming at the end of that worst Virginia game on Saturday that the your field was wide right or wide left or wide something because I couldn't understand what he was saying if he was screaming so god damn loud is if he was about something very important which he wasn't but nevertheless I do enjoy seeing them lose because number one of the corruption of the program and number two because of the fun it's a fantom thing in this town they couldn't even sell out the fs you game with 50% or 80% of the people where there was seminal faint they couldn't even sell out that game could they that's right but if they should have like one of their glory years again all of a sudden and they pack in 80,000 full year front right this town is great for that front running phony's very big on it so i'll talk about whatever the hell I want to talk about thank you and a response will be just the same none of the all just like i heard this morning see i feel much better about it now there's only one person on this station that gets phone call that tank if you know this that hey no sir if i hang can sit down and do these two or four minutes or five minutes or whatever and ramble on and there you go here's a time in uh dating one after another after another now most of our course in post of gambler but nevertheless i salute hanged the fact that his phones bring off the warning show to the get calls no do we get calls in a large yet i got a bus i got a proper bone to get these back to the restaurant there's like that guy that's calling you screaming how are but they're intimidated see i'm supposed to be the lympharist in fact there's supposed to be the macho man of course they're hiding the alley behind the anonymity of the telephone which is i mean even less excuse for the not having the McCones to talk to me but they just can't do it can they do it no i want to hear right now from some people are talking about gamesville what would he give me a look like that for i've never been the gamesville i would like to find out something about what kind of a division is it kind like lately that driven to lakeland that's a horrible place i'm never driven to lakeland but if i didn't want to lie ladies city i've driven to uh is it like that when they have a horse country a lot of horses asses running the way you know it's a college town lot of young people running around a lot of bricks a lot of uh i be on the walls i be you can go float the it's a type i be on the wall so you make it a town like kind of like harvard now something like that like i don't know it's just like dark middle of a spring pan or carny or whatever i be being school kind of like brown no i wouldn't know i can use the higher learning i mean there's anybody learning anything and before we get anything else here this morning because i'm fascinated with the obsession with his gator thing here i mean i know that there are people the animal hunters who are the gators where anybody ever seen any gator dropings because i thought i heard of you this morning during the course of the life of our day chill gator dropings here's my name hello hello hello yes sir yeah i moved on here if you wanted to go from Houston yes moved on here during the time when the baseball team was selling out all the earth your star players yeah and i remember you were you were and then rave and about that you were saw given away your tickets and different things and you were right now and if you were in sir and nobody cared right but i remember that you were saying that you weren't against the players you were trying to send a message or we should send a met no care who the owner is talking to me is more important than wain highs in go or anyone person i don't give a crap a little bit in addition to which he claims he's going to be selling the team i hope he does real soon i don't care about that then worrying about who the guy damn owner is but let's face it i mean as bad as the team is it's not like the hockey team like had a whole bunch of superstars in the face with a marlin thing okay he went out and he bought a championship team spent a lot of money for it and then he said well we got to have a new stadium in all we're not going to be able to get the marlin jiff and then you know he gave everybody away and they still didn't care they lost the hundred and eight games and nobody still cared about it well i i i i i i i i and it games will be barnelly anybody online this word oh no not a one see what i'm saying is that a difficult thing to find out somebody who was who lives it lived in gamesville somebody who went to school there we got to find out what the hell is the bigger trash you would gamesville maybe it's even more exciting than he's planting you think so no and are worth no Columbus no Christopher no five six also back here in way this is going to be just no no music all way let's that transmitter kick off five six seven oh five sixty five sixty on a mobile one line this is one of the great mysteries of my life gamesville gator droppings let's hear it come on how long you think this is going to take and see this one guy the first guy that calls he wants to do not there not like a full bone shut but little shot at me are die hypocritious i am about the hockey thing and like i said i don't care who the guy they're on a race hey just look around just keep looking around you five six seven old five sixty five sixty on five sixty are number one line this morning by the one twenty two after two we got the booster at six the Detroit Redwin seven o'clock tonight and the interest in that no no just one did i you think i asked a difficult question sure if i'm on an honest answer do you think that that was a difficult i mean if they see the point of trying to make it there's all this interest in the gila's gator crap and gator football and this redneck Steve's furier then there must be some connection with gamesville it's 300 f in miles away from here and i'm waiting here what it is and i can't get one for and you know there are all less than every god they're more than including this jackass the ropey and on this postcard get rid of the arraggies we want sports and i'm trying to learn and i want you to learn me something okay and i still can't hear nothing here about gamesville which evidently is to have a lot more important than anything else that's going on five six seven five sixty i mean fine working the phone and working how do you like the time sitting here screaming at the all in carrying on a phone's not working how did the one guy get true hello hello yeah i do i like the how to where did it have where did you come from i just called from a mobile and broken how long ago i've had it's been ringing for about ten ten rings are full of constant here you know something i could be saying every word that's the phone's broke it might be no i'd like to be hidden on call on call about gamesville okay let's hear it found you run clock class ninety six graduate when there for five years and tell me all about gamesville what is i well it's your i guess it's your call to make college town i've been to some other college towns and i thought gamesville was the best one you know i've been better i'm not that easy better than you know i've never been up there i've only been told cover better than an hour more you know couple schools in the south can you that data me so you know i i can't talk about these asking a column is in places like that my brother's did go to Columbus about a month ago though for football game and he said he really had a great time into the you know of course the people with a higher very nice and the Columbus was a great college town yeah it was a little bit comparable to games like said that it was just a much bigger city and of course you've got the different weather and a different i mean other because i people stand well of course they sell out of the game and the football game because there's nothing else to do there yeah i hear that all the time they you know that they do say that that's true but you have to remember that i have to people that that go to those games come from all around they drive up from here you know from sandfuck jack and bill so i mean but what's the what's the what's the university of florida what's the student population right now it's right around 40,000 and they do 70,000 and some for the games right 85 85 85 and saw every game of course that's right every game sold out even if we're playing uh death in dumb year or for playing a state of the man are you're calling her code name's definitely you know and uh oh no i'm not a need i'll talk about like a little pre-poss that we played open the season right well everybody's gonna do that you know and i get you know again the reason why we do that is because you know our family's only problem is up in east lansing we tried that too but they've been out in the mid-beauty so it didn't work out my central Michigan eastern university tour and we luckily like to leave that hasn't happened to us recently so hopefully you won't happen in the near future okay now go get us all right see yeah and now this was the most revealing thing that has ever happened to me in my life i've been broadcasting for 600 years and i'm sitting here and i'm getting every day i'm getting sabotaged over here i'm getting a job you saw it you're always like i said i hate the system getting her the good people's phone system i'm gonna tell you i'd like to break the guy's anything now i'm gonna do a handover right here on here and lose it i'm gonna do a hand right here and just totally lose it because i've been sitting here for god damn ten months with a phone system that doesn't have been worth i'm sitting here saying to myself even for a crank to be calling it i mean i know if we got anybody listening something must be going on i reach over here and i start personal a god damn button let me ask you this what happened after i did that that suddenly magically allowed the calls to start coming through djord what happened i just think about it still broken so in other words they don't ring they don't ring or doesn't show up on here now i could go and reset the system to see if that helps and it probably will be there and i'm gonna tell you something this guy upstairs wants to be a big shot like i told you before mr want to be we could get a god damn irrecter set we could get our own little god damn teeny tiny transmitter and put it out here on 441 at least the people on 441 can you have a god damn safety in their cars which they can't now i could build a better god damn studio with a god with an erectory set with a play toy then this man is putting here for us ten months sitting here with a god damn and you remember in the beginning when the phones wouldn't drop off we've had more epic technical god damn problems and still got those big numbers how do you like that while you sports there they can't stand they show who are listening right now i'm going to reset it during the break everyone we ought to reset the whole god damn radio stations what we ought to do 27.2.10.2 a and a good station stands for nothing to end a talk show without a phone that were study like that we're kind of used to it though aren't we it's uh i just point you so in other words there were all these people calling every god damn line had somebody out there the random birthday they weren't ringing because the little green light don't come on in here like i'm lying to here see oh now the dial isn't but when a range it doesn't build up is what you're saying to me that's what i'm saying okay so this is next we can as usual here on foot shot radio here is a mobile in Miami hello Neil yes sir yeah i'm a florida graduate i had a little stuff to steal on that city uh a lot of people are calling i'm trying to make this a glorified town about games bill and university florida let's face it they make name for that town is haunt town mm-hmm that's what is known by the local writers uh yeah and number two the only thing that's ever been beneficial out of university florida is his marijuana growing that's from the best we didn't america uh uh we're talking the drug culture is phenomenal and i thought about how he did up there for four years is that got stone got laid in uh with the class one of the pages like an hour were times like the main with the great town i'll never forget it i lost a few brace i was worth every hour but what's the obsession down here i mean this gator thing is it's bigger than the dolphins it's bigger than all the other sports in his town for the get it it's like i like a mental sickness down here well seriously if you go up there you have to spend many time in games though it's like being under jail house arrest yes nothing to do with some of foreign town in the world that's where everybody goes to the football games if you're not getting high you're going to put programs you're getting away so when you're arguing about 85 thousand people someone out there became even when you're playing the bump for you it doesn't mean nothing it means nothing else people are from games the least traveling like the last color set they travel from all over the state of florida it's the biggest boosters in the florida from gays where we have the biggest booster clubs but there's nothing going on in games though it's the pressing staff of static town it's known as harm town and any local will call you up and tell you how to say hey all right thank you they okay pal today your just on a way to see how good the weed is up there we have another already know how good it is what do we know it does well how does the weed is from games though i visit friends up there and yeah he's right the place actually is not gonna do there but they get stone and get late and get late so what's wrong with that what's everybody pitching about sounds okay to me two open lines going on here we ought to just play music today teach these vansets you goddamn lesson that's what we really ought to do stickers in here with a bunch of second rate crap top rated show in a goddamn market top uh billing a top uh rate a number and by the way we ever get those numbers now from ten to two oh and i don't think we're going to at least not today why not self is on vacation and Greg will not be in today okay okay so here you go i want you to follow this now follow the bouncing ball okay the general manager Greg read with a pasty suit he won't be in today at all and get the program director you think i get a lot of vacations this guy when he's here he's on vacation number one but now he's on another what is this it's the end of October it's only his 18th week on vacation this year is that what the deal is yeah there you go so if there's something wrong is there anybody oh you know who's in charge oh my god and she don't talk to us that's right the water not see she's the one in charge maybe that's why it's taken them so long to get that goddamn parking lot fixed down stairs you notice that the repayment of parking lot the inside those are those big shots that that's like a major it's like a 10 year project down there now by the way when you go on vacation to never your clicker so i can plug under the building like hot shot no next question so this is fantastic so let's just have a party here today okay let's do our own thing we got nobody run in a place it's on automatic pilot buddy all right that was great this is called for this 15 minutes oh what needs calling oh which but he is that that's the old guy or the old guy is that is right over the death threats yeah you meet everybody the wife the receptionist upstairs yeah we'll get to him again have a look you have another what is his number your guy the car's here keeps making death threats and they want to have his honor and only order and report he said it well it's already been reported real five 0 5 9 4 8 9 4 8 3 9 1 4 he's been called this for weeks some old crusty farter keeps coming with death threats and all kinds of obscenities and knocks his stuff and maybe you want to keep him busy today what is it again 305 1 full in broker hello Neil yes sir I took the one with the phone yeah I know no no people what happened before was I was trying to reach the building building all of a sudden when you were once the list of there then over seven falls third on through some it would crazy yeah I've been feeling for the last three or four months here somebody's dealing with his phone system I mean I can't prove it but I have a very strong beliefs because I've been doing his two goddamn long somebody's dealing with us a couple of things last Friday night I'd say they're the game we got the worst ever yes Friday was one of the all-time wars not the worst but it was an extremely the worst five I want to work for four is I mean knowing who he has and it was disgraceful absolutely disgraceful I don't think and so then he goes and benches the two best players are writing that instead see this is a guy when he came here tearing my I don't want to get started again but I will he said well he's guys better perform because if they don't tell me sitting on the bench and in the meantime the guys that don't perform like Kirk Moore and need a mark they're in a line of heavy guy damn night and you know he wants to take it on the guys who are best players which makes no sense at all to anybody how about the world and we really pissed me off to watch remember when he dropped the gloves the guy wouldn't engage with a bass year well who was the guy in number eight for a year yeah I mean right was Murray telling him to go out and get something going just you know trying to try and try to keep because I don't know but by the time he got to that fight it was already for nothing the game was all I ever so was totally meaningless no that say they're not going to get sucked into his stupid boom cracker I know that the number one he really can't fight number two we can't play and other than that how can why is he out there so much you know the truth when you got to team that can't score why do you put iron hands that will well out there all the time I disagree with you a little bit I really thought I saw some start of the season skills in this guy he can't play I mean I thought he's getting a little better than that situation game but as far as being a real player forget it he's not where it was really disgraceful watch and I mean it's thick handling properly is absolutely disgraceright and all he did every time he needs like a lot of cheap shots of that time I was so damn frustrated we know he's born up and with which is when I left but just to watch you not to try and engage somebody it was really a disgraceful for a person and by the way he's a big and a Donald Bush here who used to play for the Canadians he's been around league speaking of right for sure if my cover even though he is their goal but nevertheless he can play he has sales I see that I make some pretty damn good place he's a real player as opposed to just a goon who can't do anything out there and who keeps getting stuck out there over and over again this guy is like the rigid swimming back in the in the six days of the range and that one all you had to do was fight when he was trying to fight a yellow John for because you know from much real one you know he would kick the crap out of but for everything is gay yeah you know for some of the people here at moral get away with it because like everything else that's gone on here nobody gives a crap nobody says anything except me and that's why I'm going to keep her been asked I got a question for it and this is real quick yeah real quick there's a topic in the poppy post today and a three transmitter from oral sex seriously yes they're saying can't they're saying you can and not right I don't agree with that that's how I read all right they're right okay and back to you okay we have two open lines and they want to grow or if they're ready and we have no idea but let's uh okay just checking because we don't have a function in the works today and we got no nobody run on the joint today so we won't get those numbers that we're looking for we won't get any assistance here because we're on automatic pilot which means probably a lot of music coming up 10 41 at 5 p.m. it's big you're planning to have five c.o.w.a. remember when he's first got yeah I think we lost it okay we have an open line in Broward to and date our photo systems all screwed up here I'm not going to worry about the phone okay you would do whatever you want with those assholes okay she waited all that time we finally got a line she was on a virtual like getting into a bad spell like O.J. or whatever and then love a sudden she popped right out that was yet in the air anyway John Grogan has a very interesting art of DNA thing it's a organization it doesn't cut you anything to join we got bumper stickers we got placards we got uh all kinds of stuff buttons but we don't have to be organized because it's just common sense do no harm DNA but that's an interesting thing there and never it brings back the mind a situation happened in the years ago and I think we broke the attendance record for the miracle with anywhere so I am signing autographs I'm doing a whole thing and then I walk in the seat part of the game you know I walk around in the stadium and there's an old part sitting up there with some other people and I look up and I hear I hear him say I mean one of those people is talking about you but make sure it's loud enough so that you can hear it or maybe his hearing aid was a working I'd be he was an atheist yeah the guy says oh there's the other guy said yeah but he's an atheist and he gave him a look like oh he's he's an atheist I mean I could have expected if he said oh he's a fact you know something like that but this far transcended any of that stuff and and that was the first time it ever dawned on me that there's this enormous stigma of not being one of the god people even if you're a god a person that's not good enough you have to do one of the the god people so god bless you thank you a voting whoever to how you are 80 years old is from religious intolerant lunatics like the ones who killed the back to and buffalo the other day oh yeah we believe we're pro life we don't believe in your life but we're pro life of those fetuses you don't really say that in till is a store town but that's really not a bad little town and as far as I heard what is compared to palahashi oh yeah I mean what could be worse until I has you it's you know there's nothing that's going to be compared to my amy you know first verse in all that but it's not about now this far is for verse any you can see that as far as for verse any um so I'm getting to be excited for a couple of those guys while I'm team last year okay big county lines are open to make eggs right here on the thing I remember he could I could try eggs right in the county we got a full system that doesn't work last night on TV show which is the last time I've ever been even mentioned it until it goes off next week the beginning they got the sound finally straightened out no hump and then as the show went on the sound kept it lower and lower and the hump came back we you know we went to one of the support why don't make sure you get your free home job on whammy there so we got our half as TV deal over there which they can't technically get that thing straightened out I got a situation here where we got a telephone system that has been crap since the day we said down here and now he's just totally fallen apart I'm gonna reset the whole thing during this break and what's that gonna do uh maybe nothing maybe something who knows don't you think it'd be a lot better if I just said here and read all my great articles and yeah that was a lot of stuff but never thought worried about the guy damn phone I'm warning you I've been telling you that we've been getting kicked on this phone from who we are now yes I've been doing this too long I'm sorry but you saw that right there when we sat down and then all of a sudden as soon as I started talking about and punching the buttons up magically and miraculously all these people run online I mean I'm not that paranoid that I would see her make it up because I know there's plenty of times this time that you could say every word that's ever been invented for letter and five letter and two letter as an f u and nobody would call but this is just who got the im obvious and is there anybody here in charge no anybody involved in any of this stuff oh straight now for a call of course not they're all other ones on vacation again and this one is out to

charismatic and revered leader of a delray beach church was convicted on Tuesday of sexually molesting a young member of his congregation a six member jerk how are you gonna do it what how are you gonna do it the jury found million not guilty of charges that he laid a developing more involved sexual relationship with the girl million who mains with the pastor the full assembly of church of god and leader of its 200 member congregation faces as many as 12 years in prison dozens of members of the congregation crowded the west Palm Beach courtroom on two in the courtroom benches many of millions of orders are can consider him something of a cultural guru what openly after the verdict one woman collapsed in a husband's arms when Palm Beach County circuit judge Howard C. Burman ordered million back in the customs and palm will be surely after they arrived from Haiti two of the women say they later developed full sexual relations with millions but did not question because of his statue in the community some of the alleged abuse of place more than a decade ago so because of statues of the montagini was fatally flawed because million confessed to police that he found the girl all father that's good and we go again to least his time was with girls very ago that's a breath of fresh air a little bit of a change got to check out see if you're her jeans with art let me just stick my pro venerian see what we find just proving for the truth here's Pomp and O.B. you know who this is go leave school yeah just wanted to comment on a couple of things first of all I go to games till over a year not for a football game and I'll get back to that a minute yeah those are beautiful town really low rolling hills it's got a lot of Victorian homes but are just you know some of the traffic transcends all of this other crap as far as I'm concerned okay when I first came down here 22 years ago I used to go out on my balcony and tune in Dan Kelly on right who was like it here a hot-to-game and channel two what televised the game when they were fundraising and they did more fundraising that it did televised in the game now there's a bombshell the number one event in the city of game will every year is not a football game it's the gator national dread races held in March it brings in more money on my dad I'm a gator football games combined they're compared to here but then all that what isn't real houses yeah real houses that all this concrete stock and stuff all this actually looks like houses and no Toronto though all here in T.A. that already no Toronto but it was a nice town okay and bus you sir go east go okay there you go get in a few reports on games I am gonna tell you I said here that first one of your 25 minutes would seem like an eternity to me and I realized we've gone through a rough footage about the last six months on this radio station but I mean this was just unbelievable just incredible and it was like that skit on S.C. TV where the guy sitting there doing a show and he's dead because he can't make the phone ring for a lot of money and finally after he starts screaming and swearing on and let's kill all your children and the phone finally rings and up wrong number and that's what I felt like here this morning because we're being kicked here with a guy damn bunch of cheap crap that they got at the will or somewhere at radio shlock and we're trying to make magic here but these people and is there anybody here like as an interest in this oh well I just all conveniently happened to be out again here today get that automatic pilot switch going because there ain't nobody here running this ship oh yeah just the water Nazi here's a mobile info admire so long yes sir hello I'm here yes really here though very briefly very briefly yes today apparently I'm not suggesting one of these Colombian hockey fans told me okay have a nice day back this guy wants to call airy single day and tell me about his death see I we don't play that game here sir we got just like to got a call me yesterday wanted to pick up where he was the day before and repeat the same whole conversation again about the pot and whatever we were talking about we don't play that game here sir I realize you're kind of desperate over there in Fort Myers just kissed the ground that you got they show on the early temporarily but we're not gonna have a running repartate this is now his third attempt to call in here and yeah and I'm low his up hostility and psychosis about Colombians I hate to break the news to you sir I hope this doesn't burst your bubble I like Colombians okay I'm not too big on the Medi in Cartel but anybody outside of that which I think there might be 10 people on the country you aren't having join yet other than that I like Colombians okay so you young who's over there in Fort Myers that realize that not everybody who's listening in fact most people listen to the show don't fall in a category but if you have spilled over who think that you can use this radio show to spew your generalize hatred and venom forget it go get your sheets out have a great time this weekend at the rally and leave us alone over here okay and just kissed the ground that you're over there in Fort Myers otherwise the Colombians were coming guide them put your ass out of town on a rail that's right what a bunch of horsecraft that is air every day this guy's feels like a compelled to call in like he's gonna have a running debate I'll tell you what old buddy why not come on down here you give us a day at high noon and we'll get a whole bunch of our Colombian friends to meet you down here we'll have a seminar to holiday in and you can stand there and look at me right in the post face to face and you can tell them that they're all a bunch of subhuman no good even scumbag go whatever to have you said and then see what the response is okay and maybe you might learn something maybe you might be or I don't know what you differences oh eight minutes to have to 11 to five say holy Mac and on this is your bowl of the voice of the Toronto Maple Leafs and you're listening to the hockey afforded you'll go five safety WCM here's an interesting fact which I think may have some truth in it it says your four lines remain in trouble so I resorted to the facts the interest with the Florida Gators is nothing but they can try controversy the morning team comes up with dissimulate calls and since we have a great number of overgrown children running around with their college vanners stuck to their asses those are the cars they get online and effort I guess to impress the audience with the popularity of the show ten question marks and it goes on to say I'm not a hockey expert by any stretch of the imagination but what the new culture the Panthers has done with Mr. Whitney is not only unacceptable but tedious repetition of the crappy product we've been given last year the more things change the more they say the same okay excellent job sir excellent observation and right on all counts and again I don't want to do it with anybody else's show but I can only speak as somebody who's like a captive audience here last twenty minutes of that show when I'm getting ready to do this show if we ever get the equipment working and that is that here are all these gator people calling and hearing that guy then tape it at radio station up there over and over again is uh pondress ad best now am I the only a Georgian I are we the only two people in this state in this town who don't care about the Gators we've got to be we're out of step mister you better get with it I don't give a flying crap about the Gators about the symbols about the hurricane for about this fight to be honest with you I saw a little bit of their pathetic performance against Minnesota Saturday what they want to blow into the game in last minute and a half minutes over to score ten points and we want to blow in again and I'm used to it did it change my life no it's me of a colleague head this morning I'm coming to work and some kid calls he's reading a prepared speech about the dolphins congratulating them on their win on Sunday and but a bit better and then he talks about the buffalo he's reading it he's got a written out long hand and he talks about all the sleepless nights we've had in the past over on Ray Reed and uh this one on Bruce Smith and I'm thinking to myself I know it's been a great rivalry for a long time until the bills portions turn south but I mean is there anybody in this town that had sleepless nights about the dolphins playing the buffalo bill? No did you ever have any sleepless nights over maybe you're making a big bet I don't understand having sleepless nights if you're making it you know a compulsive jammer like default for some of the other people we got a new station but a sleepless night and this was some kid why don't think is making any bets on a game not yet sleepless nights over Bruce Smith and Andre Reed and Jim Kelly who's long gone and all of other go and wow and turman Thomas here's my name he hello? Neil yes sir I'll go all day yes no all day well this is morning yeah I I went to games a last week and I went to school to have five and a half years yes sir and you have some more people calling then there's a time mission to point behind games okay what is the point behind games you'll I said five and a half years there I still go a couple of times a year it's because of the drug scene Neil yeah and this dad gave her Neil what's not a different any other city or town just right he'll be like a lot of money to go there well I don't think people are calling on the morning show why don't they admit then instead talking about Steve Sparrow's parts is on a theme who's gonna catch the most passes news got the biggest lineman and all this other tedious crap why don't they talk about the good stuff what up maybe they wait 40 Neil maybe we'll have a scum or vibran janeville man maybe these bad guys might get a life and they have the all the back all night rape club in the country in game 12 yeah good news there's our first on his call of a year and it's already the end of October we have an open line in broad day county but because the phone is still all screwed up and we'll be one I keep checking them up you know okay well I don't want to say those days they'd line because some of that's another thing with this system some of them coming on those last three lines who knows where the phones are coming in here I'm sitting here screaming and carrying on like a maniac and uh... the phone systems a piece of crap anyway so what's the point five six seven oh five six of this keep uh... you know going up and on and uh... just keep punching it and the phone lines to and see if there's anybody button button who's got the button baby this is unbelievable i've done top shows under bizarre circumstances before my life but never in my life with one where we're playing hide and seek today with a phone just beautiful nice gone Greg here's a mobile and market hello hey with some yeah sir uh... real briefly uh... i want to say i agree with everything you say about religion speaking comes grab a hold of that which is fake like they do on keno frequency and twisted in the yankers and the fake too five six seven oh five six the i have no idea what we got what we don't have because uh... i do know what we do have an arts a crappy phone system has been crappy since the daily set who makes this thing getting her whoever the health get in a reason i wish you have a like a bad bomb movement okay i hope you find up with a bruised god damn echo and i had there for a few days not only does their phone system stop yeah they're call screening software sucks because it's designed by someone who never produced show yeah and when you try to talk to them about it they don't want to hear from it yeah we tried to get some modifications sure what keep compared to i use that all year you stay dumb question you know you cannot i do you want but i'll tell you one thing okay and we had some stuff over here like those old car machines he only had some stuff that wasn't maybe the best but generally speaking each week and over there and then even uh... what's his name roll a taxon was a hard ass but nevertheless they spent just on told about some money to bring in the best god in equipment the most did be our stuff that money could buy unfortunately just like over there at whammy they had a bunch of engineers who didn't know how to make it work right with their digital stuff at the TV stage but nevertheless they spared no expense in bring us in the state of the arts to try at least to give us the opportunity to compete to be a real god damn radio station on a.m. which ain't easy baby but this one over here and i'm gonna tell you be deeply people over here in neaple you're just crazy you're not broadcast is your schlottmysters schlottmysers if this audience could have seen what we went through those last days that he said before we find a god on the year coming in here today after day after day and being told well this part and the stuff was coming in here peace meal because we sure weren't gonna expand that money to buy new stuff were waiting for all no we had to get the computer over here to dcs that plays all of his neat stuff like like that we had to get this from now to let out here from on so there are other a bum for station up there and it came in pieces one carton one day another carton and of course for George Corso is working 24 hours and it trying to put it together with scotch tape and then of course this this beat up old cart deck that they probably kicked out of one of those maybe even the four minor stations that here we don't want this thing in a building anymore that also came in a box like i said this was like a tinker toy studio a tinker toy radio station we're sitting here we're like a 10 or 11 year in man in this market on a make believe god damn radio station get in postcards saying hey Greg rig get in the allow we want sports on a year 24 hours a day how do you like that so you can go back to your two shares or maybe your one shares like when a one christian was on her in a midday and even when i was off the year for seven months today still have a number here in midday oh they did not so just so we can satisfy some of these overgrown children and like i said you listen to conversation you try to talk about any sport in this town there are no people in this town who can discuss sports and tells you maybe like one percent of the people here and then most of those are people who are fans of other teams because there's sure is home out from here stevey's why's her man that guy yesterday why's her guy yesterday with stevey's why's her man yeah another hockey expert but college football now we're talking maybe because they got and we found a why they got to good weed up their in jamesville at least we finally had somebody who's straighted out for us only took us an hour 20 minutes we find a guy to the bottom of it get the seeds out of it here's for my resumbo they know yes sir you come uh these wait they got all the money down there in April and they they've remodeled seven seventy over here you know really yeah so that's about the time that you came on yeah so they probably hope the signals logged and clear over there and everybody over in a west coast here's me saying that the bees leaves are cheap bunch of bastards but look like they came out of a dimsy dumpster what they look like they're giving up good talk radio over here and uh they're putting on another a shock jack in the

we have an open line and uh power if he will let's just check that out okay line well there you go doubts what I'm one don't know P.C we have to keep checking these out because they don't ring and they don't light up and they don't do anything at our front system they're totally broken up at least one good thing the people in data consistent we don't have to check those too much because they're not bringing anyway let's try a crossprings hello crossprings yeah you know how you doing just to get the dynamic he's out of control against off board and uh little more to the airport stuff and you're allowing your listeners to hear then I'm allowing them to hear what does that mean oh it's like you know the killer or a few local teams off board and now it's cheaper than than to spend about 25 years it's more close to coming through here when they're doing those trouble oh wait wait man but your still one was in Houston Texas February 27 1991 it's got the name of the individual it's got the name of the judge who made the ruling on it it's got all the details it is true people are having here any hundred in their airport they have a right to search you no matter what and you know that's partly obligation to find and and I have a right to take any money you have on you and tell you that you are drug dealer and I didn't give you a receipt they do give you a seat that they didn't have to be close and the stadium give a seat there's a reason for that well and what was the reason bacer probably because they've identified that person there's a drug trafficker and he actually you know old people money they don't give a vote sir let me tell you you just want to make a lot of noise you're did you hear the article I've been you know a couple of men are hitting it right here to see you know what you know sometimes I got to respect your honesty but sometimes you just only cover half of what happened to you and what I could do is a little formula but if they didn't give him a receipt it's obvious that they wanted him to go through and he had answered the company because it works for a money sir let me say it to you again there were no drugs found and they didn't even arrest him okay but they kept the money let me say it again they kept the money when the officer he asked him for a receipt they handed them a receipt for an undetermined amount of US currency not even an amount of money it took him two years to go to court and get his money back real there were no drugs there was no arrest and there was no communication and you can keep saying me or me on the year 50 thousand times this goes on all the time here you're an indulgent guy first you're treating pop from a curing $9000 would be narcotics on a number two you know it was impossible for one in the curing $9000 were the narcotics so where was it you know that is the way they transport my way was the narcotics so where was the narcotics you either delivered or you got his way to pick it up all right so in other words you so in other words you we have psychic VEA people now we know this for a fact that if I get on a plane that I'm flying home for girl you didn't hear the quick no I didn't know because I was talking to a lot of time guy he hung up because he's got no balls and he's another one was lying pieces of craptured of porchers is what he is another porcher pulled up anything that the law enforcement people doing his country and you know that was only one page I read out of this book there are hundreds of pages telling about similar stories and worse hope but we just made it up here you know you're a bright guy but you only tell half of the story I'm telling you the whole goddamn story sir the DE ought to be disbanded today they ought to just fan the whole goddamn DEA

Hey Goldberg at Chula State 2 at 2 at 6 at 6 at 6, and only got the boost to its 6th briefly. Because 7 at 1 we got Panther Free Game 730. Panther City are red wings. Here's Boca, hello. Veel. Yes sir. I've been listening to you for years and never called them. But the irony of which is happened, may be a pickup to fund. I'm driving home from lunch. It's full lunch. It's a bulk up. I'm 45-year-old businessman with a suit and tie on. Yeah. Right when you're talking about the loss of rights, I pull right into a Broward County Sheriff's checkpoint. It's radio on. I've put the radio off. I look over to my Right. And there's a couple of teenagers with shaved heads and ponytails and commarrows and firebirds, et cetera. Right. Then shaken down by the cops. I come pulling up to the checkpoint. Right on through. Right. I've been 45 years old at the smoking pot for 25 years. I'm doing Right for myself, but the need for rules at the same. Right. It's brittle. And you're the voice The truth and I appreciate it. Okay, pal. You're going to good job. Thanks a lot, thanks. That's right. If you're young, if you got long hair, if you look a little on it, hit the side. If you're black. If you're Hispanic, if you're a fag, if you're whatever the hell you are, the government is just waiting to put you over and hassle your ass and we're paying big fat tax money for these assholes so they can protect us. So they can keep us safe. Who knows? Gonna keep us safe from then. That's a guy damn question. Seizing people's property, shaking people down, shaking down minorities. Oh, yeah. illegal road checks out there. And I want the evidence then the right to do these road checks. What is that on the spot? So I something here, spectacitiate a banana boat country in a tenth world country. All right, what we're just doing spot checks here to see was not a nice, what if you wait for work? What if you wait for the spot checks? This he was got, see, this is the state where we have no auto inspection by the way, which I've been screaming about for years and we'll never get it back. We got the thing where they stick that, you know, the tube up your recto, they can shake it on for ten bucks. Is if they really care about emissions? They're more concerned about other. Scored scoring missions is what they really consider about, but nevertheless, auto inspection people with ball tires would know a headlice would know, breaks their little brown coupe. Does anybody care about that? No, they don't give a crap about that. That's not what they're looking for. They're looking for something really stick it to you for, baby. So they can, so might we just fill the prison out every street corner? We can put all the goddamn drug criminals out there. The drug abusers in the jail for like the rest of their lives and throw the key away. Everybody who ever smoked a joint, everybody who ever had a goddamn joint in their possession, everybody who ever had a goddamn roach in their assures. Anybody that ever knew somebody that, you know, and of course, if you ever inhale for Christ, say, that's the luxury chair right away. We're talking about a government of lunatic fascist maniac, and that's why every time I pick up my paper in a morning, but we hear it a more for, and I want to throw up. I want to puke. And, and of course, leave it to the hero who do you think they endorse? Who do you think they heard in door size Sunday? How many guesses you need to get who's with the B? And our red, the whole convoluted argument, and it says in there toward the end of their eryadatory endorsement, it says even though philosophically, on most of the issues, we agree more with Buddy McCay. But that we think that jabboosh has got the foresight and division to lead us into a new state of fashion, or whatever it said. And you like that. In other words, what they're saying is that if we know what's good for us, as we continue pandering to a certain constituency in his town, we damn well better endorsed jabboosh. That's what they said. Because if you're reading in the hero, you know beyond a shadow of it out, it's what's good for the hero. Whether it's about politics, whether it's about casino gambling, whatever it's about, whether it's about building that arena that building down there, right down by the hero property there with a Mickey Erson and company. If it's good for the hero, then you'll be all the propaganda that you've been sucked down. Here's a proponent, hello. Yes sir. Are they got a story at a DC for you? Really, here you are. I got a story at a DC for you. Six months ago, it's for over a car. Nice bands. John McIroff and neighborhood. Yeah. Since in windows, they don't know when you're inside. They figured they got a drug dealer. Yeah. They're going to have to the car and draw a streetman. Point guard for the wizard? Yeah. They're thinking with a DUI or something, never follow up on him. He's crazy. Okay, pal thanks for the good news. What do you say? He said something about the old Washington. Hold on to what it changed her name. We have an open line and ditched off any cigars. I'll tell you that. Woo! Heavy duty. Yeah, somebody has attended our cigars. Here's a call from Naples, hello. Hello. Yes sir. I'm going to comment from a physician's point of view regarding prohibition, which you so accurately describe. Yes. A farmer has turned me in for prescribing old joys or narcotics. And the Florida Board of Medicine ran me all over the state of the US. I tried to see a chemical dependency. And after a convoluted, extremely extensive experience, the Board of Medicine found nothing and I was exonjured. But it was a very awkward experience. And what the deal is that patients are unable to get treated at the judge. Right. So with prohibition, people are going to have to know that. They're responsible for we need more people like you. That's my comment. Thank you so much. Okay. There's Dr. Jack. I mean, Dr. Enable. Yeah, that's another thing. You can't even offer yourself what I think of him in sticking their nose in there. Dr. Jack, he's trying to help these damn people want to die in peace. And they're they're terminally ill. Government's got to stick their nose in there. You can't do that. Because we got a bunch of people who are right to life people. How much you adopted? Who commits a performance abortion? We have two open lines in date. Fuck 8L. You wear a exploding ball. It was at cold. Nobody know how to put their coffin due to any days. Everybody know how to come up. We want to drive their mansion and quarry mine. No. We want to know. 16 till 1 and 5.60. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, I'd like to talk about the supposed drug war for a minute. Yeah. Oh my god, you getting a little bit of revolutionary there. Now sir, education. Yeah. Informing the public about the realities of what this is all about. Teaching our kids about drugs. Honestly, and openly. Absolutely. No one. It's just ludicrous and unorganized. Romantic. And not only that, we'll be able to keep these. Again, the average time that a murderer spends in prison in this country is nine years. We have people serving. Oh, three people serving life sentences without eligibility for parole in this country because they were going too many plants in their backyard. It's just unbelievable. And one more thing, you know, I'm a musician. I was out last night at the spa. And not cars come up. They shine that light in my car. You know, they see you know, my little bit, my hair's a little long. So my friend, I have all the information. The car and the musician don't forget. Yeah, they probably, you know, sense that. Oh, you know, they went through my whole car to talk to my bags and stuff that I'm going to quit me and went through that. Went through everything in my car. Right. You know, and then they have nothing to do out there. They're like, bored. And what did they find? Nothing. And suddenly, positively, nothing. The big, oh, unbelievable. Thank you. Thank you. They're good. Okay, pal. Yeah, he's got a long hair. He's a musician, which I'm sure they must have sensed that. They got that, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's, that's. A police effing state baby, make no mistake about it. You're in it. Too open line. Resolidating mobile and for a lot of day. Hello. You're up a lot of the stage. Lady Mother. Oh, yes, I'm out there. Um, I'm, I'm first in-pro from Connecticut. And um, I've been enjoying listening to you. I agree with a lot of your points. Um, I kind of have a hard time listening to you because you did take out the name and they know a lot with kind ofums. Now a little bit. Right. Hey, you're free to most each. We have to be the speaker in this country. So, we'll just to get eye personally in the Christian. I don't think that's the name and I do think that. You know, I just hear that title, but believe what it refer to. That right. Learn title, just say whatever you like. What? I do like, you know, listening to you. It does make it a little hard. But anyway, I wanted to ask you a couple questions about from Restaurant. You were talking about, uh, when Mexican restaurant has a two and a day. Five, six, go back to Connecticut, lady. Okay, before it's too goddamn late. Oh, sorry. Well, what is she talking about? Pretty fairs, you know. Yeah, I got a pretty peer for you sweetheart. Two overlives a day, five, six, seven, five, six, six, six, six, six, six, and pound 50 on a mobile online. Absolutely. Congratulations. Jesus, go back to Connecticut. Okay, they can't even pronounce it right. You're either spelling it wrong or pronouncing it wrong. Can't be, we have it both ways. Here's for a lot of deal, huh? Hey. Yes, sir. I'm surprised you have not a lot of voters calling you. The Coast Guard is just as bad. I mean, you can have a nice, leisurely sale off the bench. Uh, a bit of your somewhere. Yeah. And you think you're, if you do it very many times, you're going to be imported by the Coast Guard. And the reason is they're going to board at a saleholder something like that because they've got to have so many boardings in a month. And why was that other as they got a quota for that to? I'm sure they would deny. Just like they've not, they got a quota for writing tickets, which of course, so we know they do. But why would they want to board a drug book where they make it shot? Right. My friend, my friend, that is both torn up by them. He had the boat torn up? Well, tearing apart, pulling off panels, everything going to look for drugs. And he never has used drugs, never would. Yeah. But they've gone out there and his friends have had the same experience that surprised you. He had more voters calling about. Maybe we wrong. Well, I guess the message is stay inside. Like the doors, real tight and stay inside. Thanks, Bill. Okay, pal. Just like pretend we're having a hurricane, pretend that big one that's down there and it gulfed. Pretend it's up here. Just shut her up to house, board up to doors, nail it, shut from the inside. Get a lot of your supplies, of course, first. That's a good idea. Or maybe just leave a little amount of the door that can flip this stuff. Have one of those doggy doors. And that's it. Because our government is busy looking to harass the hell out of you. I'm trying to, I wish I had the time. I wish I had the hours. And I wish it weren't so boring to read stuff on the air because it really is. I don't like reading on you. I've done a lot of it last few days. But this book is just amazing. Why am? Here's a mobile and forlaterdale. Hello, Neil. I hope not being redundant but probably things that throw the less you days on. You show this poor guy that got busted for a role as the exact paper. I was living when I heard that. Yeah. But you know, in the announced of them since I've been talking about that a lot. Don't they seem to be beyond the people they know to whom they're. Or just a clean person we think like it. Right away I'm the guy. Everybody is free to say they're free of human rights. Time for the direction. Stalin's Purge of the 30s, Stalin's idea of a good young communist demanded the qualities of an enthusiastic young Nark. Some critics alleged that the public schools are now adopting some of Stalin's methods. Drug abuse resistance education there is currently being taught by police officers. There's some more than five million children, police, the names of people and children's respect are illegally using drugs. A mother and father and Caroline County Maryland were jailed for 30 days after they had a daughter informed of policeman providing a school antideroprowim that her parents had marijuana plants in her home. Prop 50, 75, 60, WK, but he loves 8L. But Neil Rogers shall order down. It's not just the one to two hour, it's a phenomenon. AIMs drive by shooting range. That's right, breakfast your shooting skills from the comfort of your own elder auto. Target's our design to simulate your turf rivals. Listen to one of our certified customers, ice coffee. Joe, are you services able at one time you call like Kevin but 40% of the things? That's right, I watch your body count climb and just one short week at aim. But it came from hollow point five green ground. You get one pass at the dive range. Free. Remember, we at aim aim to flee. 103 or 56, WK. By the way, your hand, your facts is great, which I will read in a couple of minutes, but one copy would have been enough, not 100. Second of a one copy, our friend over there, Julio and Dave County of it, only ran on a phone calls and his desperate to talk to people in this audience. Desperate for an audience, 305, please. 305, 8. So anyway, your hand writes to this fact. He says the problem is this country is that everything is demonized. Things as natural as nudity, for example in Europe, you see nudity on TV all the time which as you do. If you're watching a brakamer, so you say, and you're up, you go to the beach, everybody is button, they get in, so what? The body is nothing to be ashamed of. The weight kids are raised in Europe by the time they get to be a teenager, they view the body as natural and since they see it naked all the time both on TV and at the beach, there's no demonization of it. They don't feel the need to hide it or look at polo magazines of the covers and movies etc. By the way, those things just mess up people's mind. You said, because of the way they did great, etc. And so on. Also, in Europe, the minute you're holding up to hold onto a glass, they serve your one or beer, but actually the police officers don't have guns. They only have a baton and most of them are to bite and they get a lot of respect over their because they're not intimidating like over here and they treat people well. And the crime rate in all of your put together is less than one big city in the USA. Right on target, Johan. The one facts would have been enough, but thank you. Two open lines of Dave County, Barbers Line. Here's a West Palm Beach, hello. They're Neil Kutshutter, they're me. Yes sir. You know, the show on A&E, American justice with dual-colders, right? They did an expo day on the stormtrooper, see the people that said, really? And they had it was the highest, the best response they ever got from the viewers after that show. I'd feel like that. They're interviewing people, who you think is standing in front of the camera talking about it. The victims of the stormtroopers, not the stormtroopers, they're all hiding their faces and shame going into their little castles. Right. And that was the highest response they ever got from one of their shows. Sure, because it goes on all the time and these little people they got in the way to turn and they have to spend their life savings to hire lawyers to try to defend them and get their property back or whatever it is that they took. And it's an nightmare. That's the whole thing. The people have in the re-sold and there's no recourse. Right. And lawyers are definitely not going to try and do anything about because they're making money. Because they just come in and they make it up as they go along. And here's another thing. I mean, this is definitely something that happens. I'm a white guy driving a pickup truck. How often do you think I get half a bite of cops who are driving down the turf? I get more fact in the night. Never. Never. Well, that should sit. Okay. All right. I have a good day. I guess the message is light enough. Yep. There you go. I have a lot of it. All you dark and plugged in folks out there including some of you are too far you're better light and up a little bit. Get some chlorox. Reach it out. Win and down. Because otherwise they're going to be stopping you and has to run your goddamn life. Two open lines in date, county five six seven oh five sixty. Prom five sixty on the 18 to wireless line. Here's Tamarack. Hello. I'm going to go. Yes sir. What's up through that? What do we do for a pound? Hey, I went up to visit my setup and northern Florida right? One time. Yeah. I come back. Get off the planet. Go down to the car. So I go to use the payphone. I get off the payphone. I go walking away. Two cops come up. Show me the right. Did they want to look into my bags? Yeah. And so why are you looking to my bag? Well, you fit the image of carrying drugs. Huh? Nice huh? Now in. And what way did you fit the image? Because I had long hair at the time and I had no back in a ponytail. Oh, drug dealer. No credit. Yeah. So I told my sit down. No way. They said, uh, they've been over one of their rubber superiors. Yeah. He asked if he could look in it. I said no. So I'm not going to let these two wash her. I like you. He goes to me. I'm not going to. I should find her. I'm going to dog out. Put them on. So he's a dog out. Dog cares into my bag. They open it up. Nothing in there. What's sorry. They don't take. Uh huh. Nice deal. So pop it. Don't have a brand new bag. Is that what you saying? That's what I'm saying. Nice. Can I call somebody to speak? Go ahead. Superinger. Major. Three bags. Okay. Okay. We're not going to a couple of calls on the board. Like the guy said before. These phones ought to be ringing off. They're hooked. Because the public out there. They're the out there used to this. They like it. They like living like a bunch of lemons and a bunch of sheep. And they like being put upon. Two open lines. And they do it. Broward 5. 6705. 6. 5. 6. The only thing to do is to clip them. We got in here is garbage. I should have mentioned this on the year before. All of a sudden. Just as quickly as the problem started about a little bit after 10 o'clock this morning. After the first two calls. Just as quickly as the problem from Bell South began. And that's where it originated. And that's where most of it is. And I understand that no that for a fact. Just as quickly as it started a little bit later on. I need to try to do a unscrew up whatever was screwed up over there. All of a sudden the green lights came back on. And lines were ringing again. So it wasn't on this end. Sweethearts over there at Bell South. Who keep giddling with my life. See if I had or we like I said this yesterday. I'm not joking about this. If I had a real lawyer or real agent. Somebody to go to bed for me. I wouldn't have to be put. Now put all those bull crap all these months. Like with the TV thing over there. Here I'll make a laughing stock idea with a home job under it. Can't hear the audio. We got the guy down phone company. We got somebody involved over there that's been dittled with our stuff for months now. But do I have anybody to go to bed for me? Do I have anybody that even called after that those rose job I did yesterday on him? Of course not. Because I have to keep chasing him around. You're good. Oh, for some reason. Sorry. Call today for what? Just he if I could, uh, facts from the copy of those notes. You can turn. There's a lot of nag I didn't think. If you could turn a clock back and go any yesterday's waste basket, which is where they were deposited, and get out your, uh, super glue and glue or tape all the pieces of paper together that I tore up in little tiny pieces. Man, oh man, there's only one thing I can say. One thing about normal camp. Boy, did he have a lot of critsa. I'm 18. He's dead. Jater me. If we're busy can call Julio a 305 821 1716. He's done to wants it. He was on show. Here's a lady in West Palm Beach. Hello. Hey, Niel. Yes, man. I see a year ago, I moved in Northern California a little bit north of San Francisco. Elementary school children were being encouraged by the school to turn their parents in. Right. They learned to recognize different drugs, pot and things like that. Dear to turn your girl parents in right. The girl home and turn your parents in and come back and tell your teachers and they can be arrested and you'd be an orphan and all that. That's great. I think it's wonderful. My man, as far as everything goes, pot, your show, other TV shows. If people don't like it, one thing leads it alone. Right. That's called freedom. It's called freedom of choice. It's called real freedom. And it's just like people are called. We're going to get you off here. Well, first of all, they're not going to get me off here. But secondly, why are they concerned? Why are they so psychotic about the fact that I'm saying something here? That says they can't deal with. That's what bothers them is they can't handle it true. It's the old line and not switch. You know? They can't do it. They don't want to turn around. They want to silence me because their idea of freedom of speech is whatever they think is okay to be said. At the same time, they can't stop listening. Right. Exactly. What's up with that? Then I wonder, am I a policeman too because I am the citizen of the United States? Oh, yeah. Is that mean? I wouldn't. I think it should be illegal for people to worship false idols in church. Right. We don't start waving the churches and going there. You're right. And we ought to start to bust in those bastards. And how about driving 56 miles an hour stealing cables, spitting on the sidewalk? Right. Making the Lord's name in vain. Right. We can take it pretty far. We have another interesting thing going on in California. Great. So Indian gaming. Right. Saying in the hour, you have, you're quite a bit of casinos. But they want more and they want it to be under a proposition five. And Vegas has peed in their pants above. They are peeing in their pants about it. They can't stand it. They know what a demanding manning or letting people know. They know they only people are post, but if they're ignorant, so let's listen to that and think that it's important, it's important. When they just don't have to go. I mean, why can't we hit it? It's just like down here. I mean, we've been heading on the pallet about 200 times since I've been here 20 some years. It's never going to pass down here. And, well, what's the big deal? We got dog racing, we got the high line, we got harness racing through a bird racing. We got every kind of gambling out of the sun. We got Mickey Harrison and all his bogus cruise ships out here. with his gambling ships and over. But the casino gambling, it's evil and all the other 233 cr. it's part of the same mentality. Well, yeah, I would be seeing to it. Hittiest dogs, you're the other day at home and they said, don't see Indians have enough money now. Isn't that great? Don't they have enough? They've got running water now from the last. Yeah, man, they got running water. They even might have a few flush toilets for Christ. They said, what the hell are they want? What? They want. And I think the big thing is is that they're going to get the wide eyes money because they're so freaking egg nodes about time. I hope so. And I hope there's worms in all those cigarettes too. Have a great day sweetheart. All right. We have two open lines. It's day one and Broward. Getting kind of slim again here right now. Guess we must be putting these people into a comment on how this group is every 15 minutes. They want something new to avoid a play with. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 5, 60 on the 18, T, wireless line. We're waiting on you. Here's Miami. Hello. I don't know the answer. You know, I am just interested that we're talking about people that don't want you process these police officers that are totally brainwashed. They have no interest in due process because there's a mere guilty and so-proven innocent, which is actually contradictory to the American form of law. Yeah, if they assume that you will look dangerous or that if you just bought an airline ticket per cash, where it's staying so long, right? They're just assuming, therefore, you must be a drug dealer. You must be some kind of a criminal and they're going to shake you down and terrorize your life. And then if they happen to be wrong, well, okay, too bad. Exactly. And then that's just under the same curve model. Why aren't? Why aren't banks with significant drug, drug accounts, confiscated like people from homes or confiscated when they have. Well, you know, it's real interesting. The hypocrisy that goes on, I was just on George's during the last break. You remember years ago, I know how long you've been here. But back in the 70s, in the middle of late 70s, when all the drug money was coming in here from the Latin America before their pace of the, you know, the currency became almost worthless. But before that, they used to come in here with brief cases loaded with cash and it was all drug money and they used to buy the big screen TVs and their VCRs, all the appliances and then ship them all back to South America where they were from. And everybody looked the other way. Exactly. We even had a mayor Maurice Farray who said it's a time. Well, you know, maybe there's a recession around the right to the country. But we don't have to worry because it may be not the greatest thing. But at least we got all that drug money coming in here. Exactly. The mayor of the city who said that. If it weren't for those two cases, the alcohol avenue in Miami wouldn't have the banks that it has. That's right. And the development that happened in here wouldn't have occurred. And everybody looked the other way. And one at one end of the point that I like to make out, I was just in Costa Rica with, I don't think of it as a little bit of a land. It's a day tour group. They take, yeah, most dentists, Costa Rica would have. And everything was cool until the day we left. One of the local women in government actually bought a Catholic priest and 400 people to block the road so that our buses couldn't get to the airport. And they had riot police. They were on a quiet street. He probably wanted joining on the front. That's where we were wondering, you know, it's why he didn't jump on the bus. But they brought riot police to stop people from destroying these buses. The father owed two countries. It's supposedly where, you know, homosexuality is not a lot. I thought Costa Rica was like pretty progressive. So did we. We were on the Northwest Coast and Guadalacanacic public island. You know what? It was only just a few of these ho-dad. Bible something, middle age mentality people because of the people in the, in the resort. We're nearly in tears. They were like, you know, we were unsure about it when before you all came. But when you came, you were the nicest cleanest people in the best place. There's not fact in the turf. Yeah. Anybody out there who does a Catholic priest who's getting in now, you go get them. Hey, no, no, when you got a backwards, if anybody out there who's a Catholic priest who's straight, please let me know. Have a great day, Phil. I've been asking 23 years of it on a year, Miami. Give me the name of one Catholic priest who's straight. Have you got one? No, no, no. Anywhere in the world. No. Okay. And I'm telling you that there, I, all my contacts in Rome, I keep hearing more and more that they're positive to pull picks it up the records. No question about it. They know what for a fact. I mean, is there any guy who wears a dress for Christ? So we always knew that. That helps. We always knew that. So what are we talking about here? A little bit of hypocrisy for us. Open on a date County 567560, pompive 60 on the 18th of Eweryler's line. The Julio line is 305 8211716. Here is a Hollywood Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. Yes. How you doing? Great. I just want to say that the reason that this country is in the shape is as it is in today. Yes, is because we, the people, let these police agencies in these other forms of government get away with it. Yeah. Why? That's the people. The people don't do nothing because they don't give a crack because they're busy watching their stupid judge or springer and their TV shows and they don't give a crack. It's not the truth. You were over the show. If you listen to this radio station the other 20 hours a day and hear these assholes calling and hear about the gators and the gators are going to take your ass. I mean, you know, everything has, you have to have a you're a bright perspective. And the problem is in this country, the priorities are all upside down. The fact that they got a some dumb jack that's going to make $13 million a year for playing baseball. This is unacceptable. Is there been one person call and make one comment about it except me? No. No, and you can listen all day every day on his radio station and he's bow to those. Oh, what's the more what's the spread on his game? And, you know, do you think the offensive line can handle it? I mean, what are we talking about? He's talking about people whose interests are so disproportionate to what life is real about that it's hopeless. Yeah, you're right. You're having to put that right. And don't ever forget, pal, whatever you do. That's the American fucking way. Right. You're right. Have a great day. You're true. If that passport. Oh, but we're told that this is the greatest country in the world. You know what? Every time I hear like people say Miami is a world class city. I keep in my pants. I have to call up June Allison to get my depends. Every time somebody says Miami is a world class city. I just teed all over the place. My bladder just cut through every time I hear that world class crime world class photos. All you got to do is read the columns in the newspapers read the columns in the sports section save high with our stupid idiota column this morning. Oh, yeah, it was probably a good idea. This is the story. Yeah, right. Sure it was. They why don't you have the ball to really say something. That's the problem. Why doesn't anybody in this goddamn town have the ball to say anything? How long have I been asking that question? How many ass suckers does it take to fill up the hours they on the air and is down in the newspapers? Ask suckers, pandivers. We got about 100 gildy is only that most of them have a better voice. That's the only difference. And maybe one decent statistical. Here's a mobile in Davy. Hello. Hey, are you doing good? Okay, sir. It's good. Okay. I might get the problem. I can bet I'm going to tell you what I just saw. We're just going to figure out. I was in in a video store. Okay. And I was looking around. I saw video store. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I was looking around. I see the stupid girls about four and then I'm wanting to make stuff. They want to have four for them. Well, they're four real thing about four years old. Yeah. All right. Okay. Was that creative? Was that beautiful? Was that the interesting? Was that boring? How really weak? Oh, God. Here's the end. And did not have my finger sitting right here because I knew it was going to be a polycraft. Thank you so much, pal. Very creative. You're just what we were talking about a minute ago. Bozo they could be knocking on your door right in your house right now. Take them away. Every position here's a newbie make it up stupid stories. Okay. I think too many of those videos. There are you know, if you're okay, just let it heal up for a while, it might be good. Here's a mobile info lottery. Hello. Welcome to you. Yes sir. I got the biggest thing report you've ever heard. Yeah. I just went to Macarena. Yeah. And in the south parking lot there's a way to undercuff cars in their all-grifts and right here. God knows what they're doing. Really? Exactly. It must begin ready for the celebration of the nice hockey game. You think? We're doing it. They're doing it, huh? He's not doing well. He's a matter they just got to welcome me in committee way. I'm waiting till I get home this afternoon. That might be a maybe that's it. Okay. I'm ready. Okay. Thanks for the good news. Oh, by the way, I'm waiting about. If you just cough up the 75 cents, we wouldn't have all that traffic congestion after the hockey games. If you just come in off the sod raster and cough up your 75 cents because you don't have to pay on a way out because we have all this hostility and people very angry and wait too much of the traffic is going over here in on 136. It's set of ones so on. Come on. So you're already paying a hundred and twenty bucks. What's another 75 cents? I did. What's in the decademy for those overpriced stuff. You know. Like I said, you're watching it. You're seeing it unfold right between your eyes and that'll care what any of these sports suckers on this radio station tell you they're killing the geese that laid the big fat golden eggs because they're sucking the blood. They're sucking air v ounce of money and energy out of the so-called fans and it's just getting into the plan and putting a boring terminal product out there. That's getting worse than worse and more water down. It's, you know, they had a game in Greensboro, North Carolina the other night. Nice gone Gary. But man, if there were 500 people there, it was a lot and then they put the paper next day, 55 hundred because that's how many seasons tickets they got sold. So that's the number of tickets sold. But the number of bodies in Adorena, if there were 500 to a thousand that was a lot, I have never in my life. I couldn't understand whether or not there was no storm. No, was there like a natural disaster? No, we're having a war. No. I've never seen a professional sporting event of any kind anywhere in the US today with so few people in there. A handful. But we're spending millions of dollars. If I'll guess what, people don't give a crap anymore. Okay, because we've been fed enough. We've been ladled enough. We'll grab. And you can only squeeze so much blood out of a rocket and finally, even the most if it easiest of people finally start saying, no, no thanks. One, two, three, three, three, five, six, three, two, one. I definitely even mentioned a listing about the Republican candidate in Tennessee who shot and killed his opponent. Huh? That's well good way to make sure you don't lose the election. County verse wasn't the kind of politician who made enemies. The courtly 58 year old Tennessee state senator would stop his hogs early each morning before driving his pickup to the capital of Nashville. On weekends, he walked door to door and rolled onto a chicken and O'anore will post and winner make sure their heat was working. A popular Democrat has re-election seen certain until last week when verse was found shot and dane and is struck near the pump, his pumpkin patch. Later in the week police met in the rest 34 year old Byron Looper, works with a Republican opponent. Looper was something of a carpet factory dropped out of West Point after an age where they moved to Georgia. He spent some time in Puerto Rico before making his way back to Tennessee. It didn't take long for him to run a foul of the law. Looper was scheduled to go on trial and December for abuse of office and theft. Prosecutious here come to Miami. Prosecutious here say he offered tax breaks to land developers and exchange for campaign contributions and an elite my family campaign ad Looper tried to pass office girlfriend Terry guess as his wife. Guess as since charged Looper was raped, same the assault produced a child who was born last August. She is demanding $1.2 million in damages in Tennessee. That's the American fucking way. Here you go. Like I said, he can lose that election in the bad guy. Where were going? Here's a mobile and prom beach. Hello. Hey, Neil. Good afternoon. Yes, sir. Good evening. Well, I can't wait to see Steve. You wiser and then play tonight. Yeah. And good thing they're really shepherds. One of the other new lineup now. The red wings. Yeah. Yeah. The real smoke up around the bed and for the arena. It's an antifreeze time. Yeah. What time is it going to open and get in there? 6 pm. There you go. You can play. I mean, I'm not saying the food is real real bad. I mean, it's okay for our arena food, but it's very, very overpriced. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Who won't say is I don't mind the money they're fine. I was playing about. There was an answer. My Zelbo Volvio. He's your cool roommate 16. He has true the range has only had 16 shots, but I'd say at least half of those saves were spectacular. And he had written a plate out of their mind. And for a scoreless tie, it was a phenomenal game. It was very entertaining, sir. Neil, David, ladies, the watch, I talked to you out of the camera and tell him nine in Detroit. I have a little hot guy that he came up to me is that hockey night in Canada. If you know it's not that you're lost in any work, you know, well, you know something they've seen have you seen it since? No, I have. Well, by the name of the music is pretty much the same. I'm going to share some of my lines. I'll be here there. But that's it. Who am I being police? I was saying, okay, I've been right in the hockey night. I mean, I've been right in the hockey night. Well, I think I said it. I've got to be a bad hockey night in Canada now. Oh, no great. All in fact, well, now what was done, Cherry Sand? About the hockey night in Canada the other night? You've sitting on the floor. You're going to set up straight ahead. Yeah, of course. We're always away. What's going on? That's it. Is this why are we doing this? Well, we're going back to that. We're going back to that. We're going to the next. Squeeze. We're going to coach the quarter and after everything else is been taken care of. It will be a lot of shit. All right. 23 till two at five, six, two. It's a win. They'll be on it, too. Of course, seven or six o'clock. We got the booster for one hour and then seven o'clock to pre-game. Panthers and the Detroit Red Wings. Two times, stand the cup defending champions with and Sergei Federoff and all these other guys. But he got to this one and they got that one. I mean, they got so many great players on a team that's disgusting. Okay, Brendan, Shannon, I wonder who's wife he's a okay 20. 8 out. He has a pair. 23 at five, 60 W to Q. I'm so anyway, I'm a little little correction on the TV thing on Wany for the four people. And, uh, we're going to be doing a show on the end. Vacation and after that, they're just to take it off to go get a real job. But anyway, they'll be showing reruns for a pair. But maybe forever, who knows? Maybe does it just out of spite, or keep put the reruns out there as long as they have to pay us. To like, uh, next mayor or when a junior whenever it is. So anyways, speaking about it, if I can hold it, can we get this sign here? Can we get a shot on the TV thing that I, the books? I'll probably not. That would take so much editing. A, you like those, the hockey tickets, they. So anyway, these are the two books you must go out. I mean, at all, where she's got all the housewives of America, Biny, Syrupy, Cratty, uh, feel good, uh, horseball books. Lost rights, the destruction of American, this book. You'll be spitting mad. You might actually uh, develop your brain a little bit. And pros and cons, criminals who play Asian by Jeff Bennett and Don Yager in Hardcover, just out, great book. Oh, that, no, look at there's Lamar Thomas Jeremy and a post again on the back. Say, and then, come on. Here's Miami, huh? Miami? Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi, Neil. I'm a who the or from Colombia. It's a new turn, so it's on the light. And it's exactly right. Right before the guard gate, he stopped soon and I can put his light on whatever. Meanwhile, I'm out with my friends that night. And I'm coming home. We see like five police cars. And when we see that, that is my son, you know, like a father, I'm Christian and I stopped. And I asked one of the officers and he said, well, I'm sure, here's a backup. So I'm so stopped them and there was like five police officers laughing and carrying on the back. I started walking towards them on one of them, which has come to the race until me, black lighting my face. This was not pretending to you leave. And I'm, I identified myself as a father and I said, what's going on? You know, like a police car here, we live here. If I have to tell you one more time, I want to arrest you and I say, why are living? This is my son, why are you stopping? He did something wrong. Why did they stop him? Well, it's supposed to be for trespassing, trespassing when my son identified himself as a, he I'm coming from where or later. And then my son says like four or five more cops showed up after that. So anyways, I say, well, I'm I'll tell you what I stopped you for later. When all my buddies show up, we make a motion here. He told him where my son said I was in trespassing. I just got up, I 75, I'm coming home from work. Yeah. And he said, well, I'll tell you what I stopped you for later. And he walked towards the back when I wrote up. And I must, well, anyways, when I said, well, what, you know, what's going is a turnaround, you're on to a risk. I said, well, what are you talking about? One of the rest for one asking questions for asking a question. And he goes, just turn around. I put my hands up and just rail. He starts third to me and then he gives me a field, both to my kidneys and a few punches. And that's a, that's not necessary. Oh, you're a American walking wing. Yeah. I said, that's not necessary. You know, and he says, oh, the necessary, he's researched your risk. I take him down next year. I know, yeah, three of for them, not in my neck. But yeah, so what do you want to say? That was the upshot of this. Well, how much of the lawsuit you found? Well, you know, it's still pending. That's what I know their names. I don't want to say their names. No, I don't want the names, but what was the reason they eventually said that they are starting off of Struction of O for my son? Yeah. They said, he was playing the music on a work truck and a little little tiny worker with the, so I know where it took five cops to come in and have a time because he allegedly was playing the music too. And they had a slap you in jail. They put, they put, they put, man jail, bruised me up pretty bad. And, uh, and the supervite. And then when I went to make a complaint, they said, well, you want to speak to the supervisor and when I have to supervise the supervisor and supervisor and supervisor and supervisor and supervisor, the one who almost sat my neck off that night. Yeah, no, no, no, that's okay. I said, someone else will get in touch with you. Guys, so I just went and left and, you know, it's in process. I have to go uh, brassman, false arrest, uh, harassment. I'd shoot a pants off of them. You know, and I have a brother and a sister that works for the department of justice with INS and I, I was really angry once they threw me on the ground and bruised me oven. I was, I, this one officer wearing, you know, f and trouble this and this and he was, yeah, yeah, yeah. And when they took me to jail and they take my, my record is impeccable and they start, they're trying to do much job and you can't say, oh, that was that. And we're some, we're responsible.

We come to this shortcut to get home. We got stopped by the police walking. A maestro of a resort cut. Yeah. And uh, no, actually, it was behind a shopping center. We're walking to home. That was the worst ones, man. Your big trouble. Be how did you shopping, sir? And they are a rectus. Because they said that we were uh, they had gotten calls with people breaking in the houses around there. And we had our movie stop tickets and everything in our hand. And you're stopping your hand. Yeah. Maybe that was the problem. And they showed like five police cars showed up. And they said, no, that they had calls with people breaking in the houses around there. Right. Our thought that got looked, we just got out of the movie theater. You bring the people and said that we've been breaking in their houses and how might identify. Right. And they got told me one of our police officers goes, if you don't shut up, we're going to beat you off this five-be-quad they took us to jail. My parents had to come bail me out of jail. So this stage, you know, I have a ordering and prowling uh, a misdemeanor arrest on my record. Nice. So that is an act nice. Unbelievable. So all we think I've ever done in my life that I've ever been arrested for. Yo, Ghost to show you found me when they go out. When in doubt, don't this show understood? Another question is, there are 1,800 number I can call, where I can order uh, best in the or do I have to go to my Indian. You know, it's not 8954. Okay. And vowed, right? Norman Naples. Okay, 954, you can afford it. 563. Okay. 3600. All right. Okay. Thanks, pal. All right. Don't do it again. Don't show them your stuff. Okay, while at the time, Hank's coming up next to him, my issue will stay too. We got the booster, but six. Panthers tonight for us, just score a golden idol, at least one.
