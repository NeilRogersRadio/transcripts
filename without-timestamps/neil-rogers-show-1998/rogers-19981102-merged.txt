First thing this morning I heard two calls which cut you all the bullcraft you're right to do your chase And that is So including give it a little guy credit on week last week I kept here and oh gee he's you know He's a flash in a pan and he's okay against week upon it and he's okay in the shore He played great yesterday and I just gone dugie And number two Domest coaching call well in fact this weekend there were two of the dumbest coaching calls and comments in the history of the human race In this business about what you know taking a risk they got to gain the first about buffalo Mrs. the field goal Christie who's erratic it best. This is the field goal early in the game Then that often gets to ball go down for touchdown They got all the momentum going on their side that all season long Third and one through them to first and goal on the two yard line If they're gonna get a touchdown then he has to throw the ball because they can't run in the clutch they can't run an inch So they got fourth and an inch on their own 36 yard line and I'm a state of myself at this point When Jimmy Johnson with his white hair says all golf or it's all you didn't That's what I always say go for it. It's all in an inch and they say no. Well past thank you For your face should wind up losing a close game very early in the game because he's a hard ass and What can I tell you and he don't like to medium does like anybody that would jerk criticize him so he can't say that And then lost the game including play great that's that and That of course the panthers come out there on what night was it Friday and played at one great game of the season They played so far against the black ops who are pretty mediocre anyway But nevertheless here you go great in my current Mark Perry four goals And what is possibly not good it's great Chassels they are but guess what he's an answer there go So anyway, one of the interesting things that came by that's then I think profusely to guide the brother Because I never thought I would see a copy of this one We Madness, okay play it slower and also inside the box of the video Hollywood classes collection so there's anybody out there that would like to know what but they also every Remadness and if anybody wants their own copy this is 1936 by the way with you that movie came up And if you want you own copy of it to find out where you know Where all this hysteria about marijuana came from in his country this was the movie that started it is the can't be as most hysterical He's a crap Here's a telephone I'm even call it's 818 919 one But for fear say the guys are brought that by IA fan tested column which I'm gonna read oh she gonna read again today Yes, yes, that's so yeah, this pretty one From city link October you think we really have somebody in town whose real name is Howard Villars What cuz you know me I hit those phoneie names like the Rogers I can't stand it It says very delicious pyramid in Miami is flashing like a classic TV wreck is flashing baby Says when used properly in plan well television is the single most gripping format communication known to man It is taken us live to other planets a lot us to watch readers a country's go down in flames Letters entertained and sometimes gasping for breath of the scope of human drama and competition however when used improperly Elected the devices of those better suited for something as intricate as taxi taxi to me Television as the innate ability become nothing more than a wash hour action on i95 Everyone stops to look at the carnage than shakes their head indifually You see these TV wreck survived the pony the waiting to be my part because these attributes The magic power on fox or smoke out the basketball superstar would be able to Bring two monocity monocity lobby boards together along with polyshore of your coat and you get the idea After the start cross-dade yard the local programming concept no miss city vision now playing locally out of whammy channel 69 brought to you by medium Mogul and home shopping network founder Barry Diller He's an asshole after a few months of doing this bold and expensive effort One could surprise that not since NBC's super train has been such a loud costly and visible train wreck on the tube If this station were sold on bill or shopping that were going to be paired with gives you knives and chia pets trouble is the station which had the value of both Not since CBS first clock WCIS and hired and did a sportscaster from Cleveland He used to when the shows by ringing large-iron cast all the gifts away toward has been such an embarrassment in software to television Certainly never in the history of television general or so badly The concept was greeted with skepticism by just about everyone the industry including the almighty advertising sector and entire station silver nothing but locally produced programming The time was to launch in Miami becoming huge success Then import the concept to dealers other stations in places like the York and Chicago at the rate Wany has progressed the home shopping network is looking better all the time Even before whammy made its debut mistakes were made from which the station has yet to be covered the marketing scheme was identified as Miami It take off on the call letters This the theory rent would show the stations posted at high for the area and be easy for all the remember which see it at the city as a bright on the landscape Also a lot of consumer dollars come for Broward in other words right from the very first second of airtime Manant whammy managed to all alienated huge force the potential viewers strike one at falling to the ground like those autumn leaves Don't get to excited about a couple of games But the stations in this town over the weekend. Oh my just an up the mix just a piss off the pole Opeline in day five and you mark my words there'll be people there'll be assholes in this town forgot their headway Uptimies as full will be defending that decision. Oh, what's wrong with the coach you know being a gutsy gutsy is one thing stupid is another thing What's the upside of making a first down on first and fourth and an inch on your own 36 yard line when you got the lead You got all of momentum going. Oh, he wanted to take the crowd out of the game. Yeah Any the purpose one of his final stupid meaningless articles in the hill this one starts out like he's gonna criticize you For that He says It's Jimmy's go for it on fourth and one brain storm which is worst call since he took over the dolphin to his a gamble with almost no upside The downside because it could have cost us and it goes a five-day video He's like back tracking and well Jimmy why don't take the crowd out of the game Yeah, right at he write you a little suck hole you see now old fart Like I say I'm a mushroom to my getting you excited because we'll never ever have a real sports writer in this town We'll never have anybody who really knows how to write an article in which he says something and doesn't equivocate and dance all over the place It was really intimidated and afraid to come out and say it like it is They seem Did he like magazine they used to be called the excess or whatever what what?

Yes, sir Got your figure advice down over the weekend with us today, Tony, but the little quality time on the beach On the way coming back and forth down high 95 what do I see but their care of van of false driving down in their modal home with their cars That's to the back And it means that they're coming boy that's a set by even that bad loony engine up to keep him back with a helicopter from Jim I'll boy I tell you what there was one stretch why I must have passed by about 10 mobile or small band that they'll all add on cereal tag It was like period it's not frogs you should that's not frogs Or frogs are in Quebec go get a go get a dictionary okay, look up frog They all had Ontario tags this guy's calling see this is What I'm talking about we got so many people in this guy's hometown town who know nothing about anything Anything you picked the topic no matter what it is from a to z from soups and I still ain't know anything about it frogs with Ontario license plates. Oh my god You can smell it right over your radio a Chevy Dirty baby Man, oh man, oh shea that's just one after another. We keep cranking him out And it's not their show it's this town believe me what I tell you it's where we are it's this plate This plate Woo Man You know something I'm gonna start smoking weed. I just did this side on the ear I am In fact, if they ever you know, I'm gonna do a favor give me that Play the month again if I can survive here that long and they might have to they might be embarrassed if we get like a 15 share some time and matter Whatever get a 10 share I don't big right tank anything because like I've said before you work for these people long enough You deserve a guy damn gold metal. I just say a uppin But we got a 10 share here in midday. So what's all this BS about that? What is that all about why don't they give it to some of the underlings? Some of the people aren't making any money. Hands making good bucks I'm making a good buck. We don't need the 200 bucks for the goddamn stupid thing on a piece of paper to boost our ego to stroke us How about stroke and some of the little hundred dogs out there? Did you keep promising all kinds of Promotions and more money? It's that or do you ever do that? Oh very rarely Because again it goes back to what I said before about the un Acceptable workplace kind of a thing we got going here Greg Because they just don't know how to treat their favorite people The ones that they protect up there even though they did not have to treat them Call for second in from having to do a real-day's work Well, when it comes to all the unsung heroes and it's going to work their guy damn asshole Today ever get very rarely employed the month. Did they get in it? Oh, are they getting what they've been promised? Oh When's the last time you've got him for you the month? I'm starting to Joe. You never got it from these people. Yes. No, I got it. It's actually You never got him for you the month here. It's not bad enough that he came down there and stood in the doorway the other day And give a song at it. That's right on the ear and no less But you're gonna get all three bonuses on November 20th, but he didn't see what you Including a bonus from like way back January, February and March. I'd be a spirit I was going to hiding that going to my office and locked it off on the inside and I got an I hybrid And he comes down here and says it on the ear just like that he came down here a couple of months So it's the mix oh, you want to make a bet. I'll bet you'll get it some day He's gonna he wants to make a bet with me that you'll get it some day some year some century Jesus Christ almighty So don't pay the little people don't live up to your promises little people and then just you know Exor just shine them That's the kind of workplace. That's the kind of environment that Greg Reed knows not operate here on unhappy radio I'm happy though Because I know sure if I didn't it and we're close yesterday we went over there. Sorry good friends and everyone coast And you know something wasn't even all that crowded because the dolphin game had just ended It was a sit-lating no matter who you were rooting for you got to admit even your star pushes out there Hello the game unbelievable right down to that last play when they're clock ran out So we's different over there and we're close before the crowd started coming in and the food as usual sensational They got every kind of chicken dish every kind of beef to Little boy it didn't take very long. I thought that that memo was like on the walls and the in the halls and grab your balls I thought it was all over the place and it was not so evidently the troops the hard-working people over there And Sheridan street in the QM headquarters of head of work under subhuman conditions for very far too long Our psychotic and rightfully so is that what we're hearing on psychotic Over the announcement of the QA employee of the month or October the month of September was bad It was a slap in a collective faces of those people over there when they gave it to two people who work on kiss on the country music No as pick-ins not when in FM which has nothing to do with QA Don't they have their own separate Play of the month they have their own separate deal I guess but I guess that was another way of giving the back of the hand. I want to take back something I said okay because you know one thing in life you have to leave your options open Have all during the all and I mean the whole ten months we've been all the judges bonus and my bonuses and Greg Reed's wife got sick at a plane and my bonus was two weeks like the last one and who knows when this one's gonna get paid when I'm gonna come back in here again But I keep saying well, you know, it's just the way they do business, but he's really a good guy. He's not a good guy Meg Reed he's in an asshole there you go I mean what what you're gonna have something like this which there's nothing that requires in a radio business or any other business Where you got a bunch of people working together you have to have it in play of the month which is kind of a feel good thing I hate we want to recognize you that something good for us Here's a couple of under bucks or the pin, but you better take the pin because if you take the money you'll never give it again So whatever But to use it Politically and to go on your way to ignore the people who take a lot of crap every day of their lives We really try very hard to do a country is got who've been lied to you on and on and on and get nothing like that and more Perhaps just constantly Is very demoralizing And don't go blame it on me because I just read the damn memo that somebody handed to me and it came in here I read it on the years and now people are pissed off over there and it's not because the heck it's not a personal thing within politics So it's not or will you but the riddition not that's not the point The point that is suggested other way to keep them under the storm and the stick them down Yeah, you're not important. You mean nothing and you know don't expect the rays or any promotion and the school We don't care about you Just keep taking all the crap you can do shot and the bug-off Two open lives and draw with your flat line Here's David. Hello Yeah, you don't know that okay Comment and observation about yesterday's dolphin game D Johnson call was rendered that's the shirt But also I just wanted to think but he has an observation about 50 browns called That running people who's left side on third short every time There's almost like you could What are you afraid for that issue a question? I'm I the only person that watches the way Dan We'll hands the ball off on every running play. Am I the only one who has any criticism of that or is anybody off one? Oh, absolutely not now he says that the running play guys So whole stadium kids the it's the build the defense whoever will play in kids See if the whole audience watching on TV can see it And you watch it the other stuff on a back-like booty you don't have any good stream of it any but I can guide them But I know you have to make some danger right? That's wrong Yeah, you know, he's what you think you get over to the running back well alone hand it off But yeah, I didn't either way one other thing I don't want to make it back from we know they hear what they're sure But I do want to say this you see the value of a guy like slowly who is mobile A mobile quarterback not a statue, but a guy who is mobile can roll out who can run who can do all kinds of things And yes, Danny did run for that one nine years in that one that's right late McGon Which I couldn't quite if for that but that's maybe you Not because he's dangerous that's right right Yeah, I just wanted why they would run across right Wow, then my work it was bad Like I've got a bit of a bad coaching finish. Oh, absolutely Old staff really Oh, I had to off-field make play to really tough team and You know, they did what they did Really work hey That was the best thing before this year. Okay, pal. Okay, but great. I mean I know a lot of people very disappointed because they hate to build black boys Then vice versa the heat the dolphins up there got to admit that was one aspect and game right off down to glass for a second Right out of the last catch on the four-year line and guess what and by the way You do realize if the dolphins wouldn't have had a burn while they're time-outs to that injury late in the game Could have been a Lamar Thomas good of the bet if they wouldn't have had a well-waist one of their time-outs But I think they would have still had one more time out like and who knows what would have happened then but nevertheless Here's Miami hello Miami. Oh, good morning. Yes, sir. I had a few remarks I was laughing out loud by the one gentleman that called you and asked why you best Jimmy Tell me what just called basically you know, I agree with him you should have just fun to the mirror fact That we had a touchdown just early in the game. I was surprised that was a miracle the fact I got any touch Just what I know the way I was along we're often We're doing that's terrible. We finally got a seven point leads We do have a pretty good defense on it get the boys far Even a high school coach knows you know fourth and in the inch or a foot or whatever it is on your own 36 yard line early in a ballgame I mean you don't act like you're doing something out of desperation you've been with you all me And it's better what that wasn't dollars He has not done a damn thing in Miami. Yeah, not one thing so basically your same He's a great coach for what he did out of the Poland and it's ridiculous We show me what you did lately. That's a way to exactly and And that's the mark. I must say I hate a fluency ever since that hurricane BC game. I love it. Yeah, and I hate the bills with my hats off. I mean I start saying hell Mary's every time I see him Really deserves a credit. Okay. Thanks for their least being out of style. Have a great day There's an honest call right there. Let's hear a There were a couple of earthy out of the worst thing this morning right at the bitter end Who told it exactly the way it was but in this time you have to kind of like color everything and Make people feel a little bit better about their lives Yes, sir. I'm coming on this is against and I'm Jimmy Johnson really where was Jimmy Johnson left with Which means what when when when he um when he took over the team He'll pull up over quite reagents like every green and yeah Did Eric we make the decision to go for it on fourth and no one is ready for the card line Let's be honest. Okay, you're a pain in the ass and somebody else is playing there They're playing grab ass on that phone two open lines is date one and borrow slime How come he was making those excuses and Dallas when it came and following a one and 15 year Here's a mobile and West Palm Beach, hello That is on the Elf okay, sir.

Yeah Yesterday with that call the call if he was gonna go forward to quarterback think But he can't use damn marina's with I think I think Jimmy Johnson is at a catch Twenty-two. I think he would love to pull damn marina a lot of yeah, who wouldn't about him? Okay, they can't even put in Zinhead. He's injured could house he got to put in there He got to put somebody in a can move He need the mobile quarterback. I mean, you know what going on? How come for the last five years that I've been saying on a show the rare very few times I talk about football But how come when I do when I say that they ought to be thinking about grooming a young successor Young uh in fact I heard who that was talking? He's a book camera manager about flying greasy What a great move that would have been but I mean they don't do it They think marina's gonna play forever Nobody has the gooyoni to make the move to a play damn marina was like God and he's not he has great things They can't look at that game. He built a fun line in front of them. He's got a good offensive line protect them He still can't do it and if people are so far and they want to go to a Super Bowl I want to win a division championship They're gonna think about it. They'll be open after right they can make all these excuses I think I think we better co-author a book call a pal's call life after Danny I mean there really is gonna have to be at some day a lot of people that want to have to face that day But they will have to be a day in Miami life after Danny is there such a thing?

Wait till you're there somebody brought this by it Beninger is on seven day Just to show you how free this is in America before lottery a police department has developed a bicycle registration program That will keep track of all the bicycles registered the city residents registration is optional for non-resident to ride into the city of Fort Latter What is the purpose of the program the purpose of this program is to reduce the number of bicycle stolen and assist the police and the recovery of stolen bicycles Now well, wait to hear this How much of this registration cost the cost of initial registration is one dollar if your decal becomes lost or stolen will cost an additional dollar to replace What happens if I don't register my bike if police officers may take it into possession and impound any bicycle being operated or Possessed at all streets roads highways alley sidewalks or other rights of way upon which the city has the authority to enforce traffic laws and ordinances When the bicycle does not have a task there to a bicycle registration decal what happens to my bicycle if it is impounded The police department may keep the bicycle impounded until the order obtained a bicycle registration decal or shows proof of ownership pays all applicable civil fines and completes any required community service hours Within 90 days after such impoundment if the owner is not registered the bicycle or required to return showing satisfactory proof of ownership The bicycle should be considered unclined evidence and the city may be tanned to bicycle for its use transfer the bicycle to another governmental entity Donate to bicycle to a charitable organization or sell a bicycle What if I may not present do not register my bike in poor waterdale? Well, the police department shall make every reasonable effort to verify out of city residency and in the event residency cannot be established The bicycle shall be handled as an insity non registered bicycle and maybe impounded Do I need to bring anything with me when I register my bicycle? Yes, you'll need satisfactory proof of ownership for your bicycle if you don't have proof of ownership or required to sign a sworn app at it, which will be noted by said today.

How do a little better? You know, you're a little more you getting good money Let's show a little more. I think he if you know if when he gets pressure he shows a ball he doesn't have a target He gets rid of it too quickly Well, I mean if you want to start I mean getting carried away and just knocking everything that does I think you're way out of line I think he's an ex-officent We're talking about handoff and I'm just giving you my thoughts and I want you to think to see what you thought about that He's like He's got all the time in the world And I'm a part part of your offense and football has got to be deception and you can't you can't fool the defense You can't pull anybody to guy damn steady more in the universe watching on TV when you're holding it out there like a loaf of bread and everybody Well, one and played it all screaming like run, you know, and it's not it's not to affect a damn him We have an open line in Broward 5 6 7 5 60 also one a day pump 5 60 on the AT and T wireless line.

My brother's program was like 24 bucks on the computer and Andrew did me and then the second book is said Neil God. Yeah, I believe it. Okay. Thank you. Okay. We have an open line but that was with a KN Neil comma God open line in date 5 6 7 5 60 pump. The 18 T wireless one if it's good enough to say in the oral office, maybe it's good enough for us. Oh, God. That's good. Here's an aventure. Hello. Hey, how are you doing Neil? Okay, sir. Great show man. You're the greatest man. Yeah. Listen. I was looking. He last week. Yeah. And you gave out a phone number for the most part that's been harassing you. Yeah. I tried to calm because I want to tell him off. Yeah. Yeah, through that. I know with busy. Oh, yeah. His mind's just smoking. I wish I could get as many calls as he's getting. Really? Yeah. I'm going to tell. I got to tell you everything that you say about religion. You're absolutely vague. We with you 100%. Man. You. I mean, much of all crap. All the man. They're horrible. Watch your emotional cripples. Right. I got a quick story for you. I got a friend. His name is Ron. He's listening right now. And he took his kick trick or treating. He's really key when I'm told black. He didn't told him Superman is not black. Didn't mean it's a way. Anything about that Superman is white? No. He's got a confused with the editor of the newspaper. That was Perry White. What's wrong with you, man? That was the only white guy now. It was Perry White. The rest of the world dark. That was his fortune newspaper. That was wrong with his guy. I'm not going to put that Christian parade. They met tasteless thing in him. We have an open line today. One in Broward 560-60-60-60 on the AT&T Wireless Line. We had a good response by the way on the DNA stickers and buttons and posted all the course it was free. But nevertheless, it will very enthusiast you about that. And it's very simple. Do no harm. DNA. What does it mean? That's your religion. Do no harm. Don't steal other people's property. Don't hurt anybody. That's it. Don't mess with children. Don't mess with other people's wives. Other unless it's, you know, unless it's okay. But do no harm. That's it. That's the philosophy of life. You don't have to read all the great philosophers. You don't have to read the Bible. There's double talk. That's not all this crap. It's a bunch of world crap for emotional cripples for people who are juvenile, for people who are desperate, for people who need a security blanket like Linus. And it's also a good excuse for not doing anything constructive while we're alive, while we're busy destroying the goddamn planet. That's always a good excuse. Well, a Lord will take care of that. Do it as a good of a job these days, by the way. Maybe he's busy out there out of space working on the other planet, so maybe he's working on your reignus. Here's Miami. Hello. Yeah, hello. Yes, sir. I know why Reno passed the ball like that. Wait, had he's at like that? When he handed off when he sixes on him. Yeah. They said they were commentators said that he does it to draw the defense, but the left is the right. Oh, right up. Ah. She'll work good on it. No, it's not at all. Okay. He does it to draw the defense, just suck the defense. Yeah. It sucks. Very embarrassing. Okay. A little bit of deception would be a lot more effective. I think I could be wrong, Danny. I'm no expert. I mean, I've only been watching football 42 years, but a little bit of deception. A little bit of trickery might be a little more effective. Two overlives in date, five six seven, five six, five six, five six, the on the AT&T, while it's gone. See, this is a town where certain people in sports can do any goddamn thing out of the sun. And right away, there'll be 50,000 people lining up to make an issue sport and explain it. And rationalize it and tell you it was great. Like the asshole before that said it was a, what did you say? A gutsy move by a Jimmy. Gutsy. They should have had the team side-cut just out there on his sideline within 30 seconds after he used to said, go for it on fourth and one inch on his own 36 yard. The team shrank shit about out there. He should have been shrinking it. Here's a mobile in cross-brings. Hello. Yes sir. Yes sir. What I think you guys said before was true. I've seen it on TV about Danny Panhoff. Jimmy's telling them to do that. If you look at the old days of Danny Marino, he didn't hand the bottle off like that. Yeah. It's Jimmy's. Right. What's the night of Jimmy's thing, huh? There's the Jimmy's right idea. If you look at the way Marino used to do it, he didn't do it. Like they Jimmy come up with his great idea. He's going to pull the defense with that. Yeah. And I thought maybe he'd run a little play action off. It's like looking me on my hand the bottle off. Right. There you go. Like I said, a little deception. Right. A little trickery. A little bit. Not quite so obvious right. No such thing. You know they got fourth and a minute. She think they do a quarter-back sneakier. No you wouldn't say the way you wouldn't. They would do anything. You think that they would pump like anybody with a brain would do not fourth and then turn your own 36 yard line sir. Even a three-year-old child knows you wouldn't do that. And embryo, our fetus knows that you wouldn't do that. But there's Jimmy now it. No. We have it on and then that of course they're going to be those assholes. They're going to say well you know if it would have worked and they wouldn't dream now. Well guess what it didn't. That's a calculated risk you have to make it. You don't do it on your own 36 yard line. When you have all the momentum going your way in a ball game. Then you'll just open the door and let the other team right back in. All can't hear you go. We lost two yards so now you're on our 34 yard line and they just happened to march down the field and fluidy takes him in for a touch time which has the time to tie the game. And let him right back in again. Two open lines in day five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the 18 he's a lot of wireless line.

We were feeling of the same. I know it's for my pussy but my pussy. I'm right. Well well well. My cat fell in the weather. Oh, this was for you to get a kid like a hell and a well. I got all that ever. I climbed down to my head. My brain and jeepy that my pussy is hooking away. Well well well. I can't feel it. Oh, this was for you to get a kid like a hell and a well. But y'all don't know what I'm about to go. What you push this jingle. And if you want to get it have that pre-ed. The ass pussy with fell in the weather. Then it was a pussy like a quite compare. And there. Really has a picture and has a long and crooked shirt. Well well well well my cat fell in the weather. Oh, over to push this pussy. Oh, she's pushing it in the air. And the road. If you have a pussy that you wouldn't try to tell. Never let her wander her or she might fall in love. Well well well my cat fell in the weather. Oh, Chris was just for you to get me like a hell and a well. Okay. Well, probably two or five, six, and you can't have any Monday too. I think for a lot of it, and we ought to start thinking about it since they want all the methods of transportation to be registered. You're out of a bill. You're both your motorbike, your whatever. And now you're bicycle. How about a wager thing your shoes? That's not good. I mean that's a method of transportation is walking. And every now and then you'll be driving down the road. You'll see like a shoe on the side of the road. Sneaker or shoe whatever it is. That's right, just through our shoes. In four-laterdale. We have two open lines in day five, six, seven, five, six, six, eight and pound five, sixy on the AT&T Wireless line. There's a mobile in the cable. So, uh, hey Neil. Yes sir. I'm glad to agree with you. I'm like a percent on Jimmy. I think he has shown nothing since he's come here and is one of the worst game day coaches in the league. Uh, he did the same thing two, three weeks ago again. Jack and Bill, we had the ball pretty much control of the game. We had the ball deep. And Jack and Bill's territory. Fourth and three are fourth and four at their 35, 35-yard line. And instead of plotting, uh, hitting them deep or going for them, he goes for a 54-year 54-yard deal goal. And I mean, that goes totally against Jimmy's whole philosophy of playing deal position, football, being anything's wrong. Well, yeah, I guess you want to be known as the gutsy coach for the problem as they're almost known as gutsy goat calls, Bluffin is facing him out of losing games with counter. Exactly. But the coach again, he has a philosophy that he doesn't even stick to. Yeah. So, yeah, today, like you said, I mean, only a few is punt the ball. And it could mean, Shane control of the game. So, you've been up on the 33 or 34-yard line of Miami at that point in the game. Was it like shooting himself in the fun? It's been turnover. It's the equivalent of an interceptor. Right. And just one more thing, with regard to the guy who said the game is scared to hand the ball. I'm not saying Dan to lose ball handler. But he certainly didn't hand it off like that because he's scared to get hurt. Anyone has been playing 16 years again at that point. Oh, we know we've bought out of the Jimmy deal. It's another brain store by Jimmy. Correct. They said the paper and the offseason. They said that Jimmy taught his teaching Dan a new way. So far. He's teaching how to be in F. Nice college Jimmy. That's great. There you go. Taking a Hall of Fame quarterback and teaching him how to lose. Well, we're five and three. Okay, I believe you. They're doing great. And it wasn't great game. We have an open line today. One at Browball one line. Organizers work for months together. They 46,764 signatures in Las Vegas needed to put medical marijuana initiative on November ballot. But lunch and officials who checked the petition set is held short by 43 names after Americans for medical rights after a week count official discovered a chemical in their want to make protect brain cells from the effect of is one. Graduate education. Oh, I see. Okay. Thank you. Fautious education so we can really do six all the public education. Great. Thank you. Good bye. Open line and Broward to a date five online. There's a mobile and cool for city. Hello. Mobile and cool for city. Going one. Okay. Have a nice life. Okay. Now we're done. We've got a couple of calls left on. Here's my email. Hello. Yeah. Hey. It's Bruce. Joey's friend. I brought you some stuff in the past. Joey's friend? Yeah. To get you better. Oh. A couple of years ago at the old building. Doug. Yeah. There you go. Now this is a pharmaceutical guy. Okay. Detail man. Thank you. What I don't understand. And I'm watching the top of the game yesterday. And when he goes for it, I think it was going to be a throw to the running back from the back field going up. And why he ran it. Everybody you. He's going to run it. And I think he was going to do a shot on the buffalo bills and he didn't do it. It just doesn't make sense. And every time they throw it, they got yardage on the. The way. I want to flew to play where he like, fake to run and then you to the set. Don't pack for the wide open receiver. The end zone. I think we fake everybody out of their job. And I know you hate the hurricane. But I'll tell you what. But it's got him back on track. Okay. Have a great day. Pound. Whoo. Now they wanted to talk about the dolphin game. One of because it was a very exciting. I'm not sure you're sitting with sports. I don't care about the boat. They played a role school again. Okay. I said they'd have 30,000. They have 32,000. I was pretty good then close. They took the total fan of thing over there. Okay. Sorry not interested. Two open lines of dates went. Broward 560, 180560, 160 and a mobile one line. Eight minutes passed. No one in two, eight. Two eight. Alright guys. Three. Five. Five. Little island full of J. Real man. They wear gays. San Luis and they wear tight pants. Sun, grens. After bottom every day. Bless with the miracle of being. So very best for pilots in the USA giving big things, leather and a big big way. So very best for pilots in the USA giving big things, leather and a big big way. Yeah, I'm feeling. Going the big way to check the field, we enjoy the bags of America. Call 13 at 5.60 WKM next to Garcubby is organizing a shipment of, speaking of help by the way, and I was just on down there a week and I don't know why I'm so slow. But after I left the bed in Jerry's, they were never sure on Saturday, and we had a good turn. I would collect in 17 or 50 bucks, they're not bad. But it dawned on me, the one of the reasons that I'm really pushing in, depleting and squeezing on the center one thing this year, this is the first time I've ever done this completely by myself. And years, we had the best to fill, we had the best to reconccede, we had those guys going out doing appearances. We had like a team effort. And I'm looking at these partial totals that we have over six borders that haven't reported in the US, so I know we're over 50 grand. But our total is still 49,055. You 117 bucks on the internet, by the way. That's great, that is sensational. So thanks again to Eric and Orlando, NeoWagers.com. You can order the best of stuff right over the internet on the website. But so it's a one-tone issue, and I'm sitting here looking at these numbers, and I'm really depressed, but that's not a... The only ambition is so much about because I'm telling you the way it is, it's unacceptable. It is unacceptable. It's called Life in a Vacuum. I mean, I realize when I came over here, they have the state's name, sports, the other 20 hours of this, but nevertheless, I worked with a lot of these people before, D.F. and Hank, this one, and that one, a lot of these folks. And yet somehow between 10 and 2, it's like where a total of island here were like radio and a vacuum, and so we're running a campaign in a vacuum here and try to raise money for charity. I mean, just stop and think about it. Now, one, just by us, most of somebody, remember the other place the way it used to be, people were wandering the sales manager, is this one that one people from the news department, here's 50 bucks, here's 10 bucks, here's the check for 100, whatever they could afford. And again, I can't co-horse, nor do I want to, I don't believe in reason money that way, and try to embarrass people in the getting it. But you think that by now, after all, I've talked about it, somebody somewhere in this building from management all the way down to totem hole, where to come up with something. Have they done it? No. Jesus, this is such a bogus effing placement. Oh yeah, go ahead and spin your magic in there, and you're not going to give me a spin your magic, spin that money in here, it's the big old money wheel. So the old Rogers money wheel, this is, I might as well be got brokering the time here, you know, probably might have been making a lot more because we're making them a lot more than they're paying us. Or be brokering the goddamn time. Because we have no way shaped connection of affiliation anything would erected this guy to replace the other 20 hours a day. I mean, they mentioned that we're here, but basically that's about it. So once again, it's a one-pony show, and we're doing a best we can. Oh, man. That's right, that's my ass almost as much as that bonus thing. Which is unacceptable. But the only places, you know, started the INZ, when they put me on the days, and I got to just do again, it numbers at that point, they put a bonus in my contract. Do I have a problem crossing the bonus on time then? No. And I think that was within five days after the book came up. I OD those nine years under cops and patients that I ever once, any waiting period, have a trouble getting a bonus here? No. It was something you never even thought about. It was automatic. It was like falling off a log. It was like getting out of bed in the morning. But here, every time it's a little something out of the ordinary, whether you record a spot or whether somebody or what it is, it's like a little game that's a bee's leaves and Greg Reed play here. We'll play when we're good and ready. What would get around to it? And we'll pay George if and when we get around to it. Okay. We have an open line in Broward, Altree. Mobile in West Palm Beach, Chummo. Mobile in West Palm. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing, you know? Okay. All right. Listen, Mary, if you move to, if you move to go on that, I call you and I give you a play how will it came of the Miami, Wisconsin and Spanish. And I live in Broward, so I don't really get that APP line. So I can listen to the game and say I'm just, I'm pretty minding about it, make the story. It's a deal for the game as on CMC when Spanish. You can turn on the Spanish radio and turn it on. It's on the TV. You say it's a Spanish teacher and an ATRAMS that it has to game. See, I'm here right. WCM, here right. Oh, okay. I didn't know. I'm sorry, I told you. Well, this is the whole thing. I went to my first house. I mean, I had to, I had to back him, to shut the radio off and listen to the game and name it. Yeah. Okay. Thank you. Okay. That's it. We all want to call up in the board and then we'll go to, we'll play the Miami Dolph and son of a relationship. We can't get these people in, but little out of their dorms here today, man. It seemed like there's none of the dumb. I told you I want to first and then, Frank, Jake. Miami, here you go. Oh, we're over there. Come on. Let's see. We show you. Oh, no one's ever seen. Okay. 5. 6. 7. 0. 5. 6. We got two open lives. Here we go. Somebody's shot us right in the garden. Put. 5. 6. 7. 0. 5. 6. Con 5. 6. On the mobile one line. Any interest out there today. Oh, we actually fake our way off for two hours and 20 minutes today. I mean, it's got for a second place. Any interest. Nobody went anything to say about anything in the world. Oh, okay. Just checking. Here's a mobile and poor saint loosely. Hello. Oh, yeah. I just wanted to say thank you very much for playing pussy that fell in the well. Yeah. I'm the guy that sent that to you way way back. Really? Didn't listen to me ever since. And the reason I'm playing you play is because I lost it. Really? Through a divorce. Uh-huh. Well, I just wanted to say thanks at all. So I don't know what's with your phone system, but I can hear George talk to you. Yeah, that's right. That's what he works. That's a bonus. That's beautiful. Anyhow, love your show. The solution for like ever. So you take care. Okay. I'll go find a new one. Well, okay. We have an open line at Broward all three of the days. On Fort DeWan, that Jimmy Johnson made. Fourth and I don't know. And I wanted to hear. I wanted to point out the irony that after Johnson left Dallas, Richard did something similar against Philadelphia several years ago. And I believe Johnson was quoted, um, he negatively about that call. He essentially did the same thing yesterday. And this is not Monday morning quarterbacking. There is just no justification for that call. There is no reason. It's kind of an issue with Monday. I might even say what a one-to-game. I mean, still people would be saying, what kind of a bonehead deal was that, but especially when they went up losing the game by six points, I turned a whole moment into the game around at that point. Even though they eventually had a 10 point lead. Still, you keep looking back at that point and die. I just can't believe the game would have ever been the same if they wouldn't have, would have pumbled there. And the funny thing is the crowd was already out of the game. We were up seven nothing. I have a little moment and with my amy. That's correct. I mean, to use the excuse to say we had to get the crowd out of the game. It's like saying, well, you know, if they they got any momentum at all, we knew we were going to lose the game. That's basically like what he's saying. I can't even get really up the question as a cop. I mean, you know, the dolphin just seems to me before Jimmy Johnson came here during all the shooliers. The dolphin's been playing in Buffalo and all those other wild stadiums as long as I can recall. And they still had overcome the same crowd and the same noise. And it's partly, uh, I'm beyond to what you're up again. You think Jimmy would pull the galley on a five on four? Jimmy wouldn't know our five on Uranus, seven great day, pal. In fact, I think Jimmy Johnson and Terry Murray are the same person. What do I say? Two of the most boneheaded calls in the history of coaching over the weekend. And I shouldn't be talking about it. That's right. We practice the power play five on four. So that's what we wanted to go with. I mean, seriously. I can't believe that people are passing out in their living room right now on a sidewalk just hearing me quote that out of the guy named newspaper. What a lame excuse. I mean, you sucked him into a stupid penalty. You got a chance to get yourself back in the game. Pull off a late miracle like the anti-hive did a couple of nights ago. And then, uh, no, no, no things will pass. It's like declining a penalty. The same football theory. It can't decline a penalty, baby. Here's cool, spring. So long. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. You're taking on a real and popular subject today. You're talking about God in this town when you criticize the dolphin. I agree at 1,000 percent, which is saying, and I also think that then, where we know, there's not helping this team anymore. Yeah. The guy was good in his day, but he told me he can't run when he ran those nine yards. I mean, he was spent for the rest of the day. He was hoping to be helping you. I mean, his legs are like one side from the night. What's the five? Mm-hmm. But they're all paced and everything up. Right. And we need to, it's a time we need to start to move. Put another direction with a new corner. But they haven't even talked about that. They never thought about it. They haven't drafted looking for that. They've done nothing. Nothing. And it's a direct result. This man is indestructible. And we all know that, like any every single play could be his last. Absolutely. And what happened is the guy had greatness. It was started because the guy out in sports. I mean, what's the, and hockey year year ago who retired. It still to hide his game. The match goes went out. Ted Williams, when they were up there. The marino hanging on and hanging on and hanging on. He started to look like a hazard. Yeah. And they need to make a, make a, make a, make a change. And he's talking about the re-tombing. I'm repiring about great athletes. So you got to know when it's time to hang it up. You got to hang absolutely. Okay. Okay. One quick question. It's one comment too. You made a comment earlier today about the Colosseum, or one island. They don't draw us. They haven't drawn in years. Right. But right now there's a big protest going on. The thing is crumbling. I know that. But that's a very lame excuse. The fact is before they had any protests about that. The islanders haven't drawn flies in life. They're going to have to glory in the late 70. I pretty said excuse them. Yeah. It is. Okay. But the range is down. And by the way, the devil's on draw either. Have a great day, Tom. Okay. One line left on the board that's written all the rest through that. I guess a bit of crank up the music here. It is Monday after all. Five six seven. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Five six. Two eight half. Peel right behind. Five six. Five six. Eight. Eight. Five five. Well, I know my sister all my life. Five six. Right. That is why she's now my wife. Five six. And I think, my son made her a treat. He's my nephew too. Six seven. Well, my daddy is my uncle. Your mother is my near-and-low. The way to bury paper seed, my friend's government is me. All right, 2560 WCM. Look at these numbers from the center one campaign from this last week. We do something good for my birthday. Go on by the best of the year, parts one or two are both. And if you don't want to listen to them, put them in the trash bin. Okay, but center one can use the 20 bucks. And all eight borders all over a brown, dating Palm Beach. Or you can call the phone number 5633600, brown, Carl Settar 1. They'll ship Machia de Rek, 954 or 563 3600. Or you can hop right on the internet via watches.com. It's right on here. Fight, wet on the web. They'd line open 563. I've done give that number. Well, call that number.

Or I keep thinking of myself. He's an asshole over and over and over again. Just keep shooting himself into foot over and over. It surprised that man gets to go off. He's going to be hobbling around. Here's a mobile in Marguer. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. You said this morning that there was a foot there. Even a five year old kid with no to pull the go on. Yeah. I got a son of play girl off. You margated and he's seven and he's took me. Daddy, why does he pull the call? What did I say? There you go. Oh, my god. He's showing up. Can you borrow it? At least I'll eat. I'll eat. I'll eat.

Okay. Thank you. There you go. He's seven year old kid could be the coach better than Terry Murray. Open line and proud. All three of them. We're closer to that music. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. You're new. Yes, sir. Or about. I got a serious foot. Yeah. Can you play on the fight? The pipe. The pipe vendor. Okay. We'll work on it, pal. You're put. So if he's got 40 pounds or something in his post. Here's Margay. Hello. Hey, now. How's it going? Okay, sir. I got a disagree with one of the last colors. Just said that. Marino's not helping the team anymore. I think it's like you stated earlier that Jimmy Johnson has taken a whole game quarterback and caught him out of lose. Mm-hmm. I mean, he's put a leash around this guy. So much that you've got no freedom. He can't do anything. Mm-hmm. The worst decision in the world in my opinion was taking away his audible to read the defense. I just don't know how you think about that. I agree. Okay. Jimmy wants to call the shots. Jimmy's a dictator. He's got an ego bigger than the whole town. And we're either going to go up in flames with him or the other way around. It's a moment. You know, he's a shouldn't keep back firing. Well, you know, it's, you know, Marino doesn't get the ring. Then we know, I don't know if you can put the blame on Jimmy, but, you know, you got to look somewhere. So far, he showed me nothing. Absolutely. Okay, pal. Thanks. Ever great day. Open line in three and days one line. Here's a mobile and dear field. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. I have to make your feet yourself. Did I hear correctly that during the world series season of the Marles? I think I made a profit? Yes. You're kidding me. No, not. Yeah. That ball said a pineapple face sort of a bitch. Yeah. I mean, I can't claim he lost 29.3 million dollars. And it's steady lost 13.8 million. And he made 13.8 million. I can't. Listen, and that bastard was wanting and thinking about, oh, I need a stadium. I need a stadium. Please. You know, right? And by the way, we heard any more about the John Henry deal. Is that thing done yet? No. And about the perspective buyer for the Panthers? No. It's never going to happen. You get to throw the Panthers after this season. I guarantee it. Read my lips. Oh, I don't think I don't think he would go on to do that because he's raking in the dough from that arena. Hand over a fist. I mean, he's making a fortune in there with the Scott boxes and the club seats of all the other revenues got his. Don't forget, now he's got his own joints. We don't have to split it with anybody else. He's getting all that revenue in there. And I'll do that. What the county is taking out of it. And he probably got a squeeze that I'm there for a couple of years with. And you notice he's not going to go on penny. Big bucks for any talent. Listen, Neil. I know he's just going after this season. You know why? You get it first of all. I know that people down here are pretty stupid. But they're not that stupid. So that's going to go. They're not going to go spending their money and go into it. Again, when there's no product after the first year. Sure. Well, you've got to understand though. When you get to these new arena, there's so much of it is corporate. Those season tickets in the lower bowl and the club seats in the switch. So much of it is corporate that that's not even having that much of an impact anymore. So long as the big companies are willing to shell out and keep their season tickets. You watch these other new arena's rung league like the Faitana and Boston. And something any of the new arena's. You'll see huge chunks of empty seats. They even write down low. You know, write the right center. You enormous chunks and it's not that they're not paid for because they have been bought. But it's not that they don't want to. Because they're corporate. That's all. Yeah, they're just not being used. And you see that money going to go into good going to get a new goalie? No, of course not. The guy's listen, the guy's not going to see dial my money. Here in feed and close your meal. Do up. You're in a through-spag. And a half. Okay. Okay. Mobile and deer field will clear the board. Never go to music when we come back. Hello. Do you know how you doing? Okay, sir. I've called that. Pale department. You guys called over there twice to advertise your face. And I can't get it for turn phone card.
