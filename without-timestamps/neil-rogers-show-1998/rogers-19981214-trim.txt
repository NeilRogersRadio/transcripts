This is Debbie. Hi, Debbie. I'm a student at the Apparel OperationsCon. And some body contouring and some liposuction? I was wondering, is it some tummy tuck? And the lip augmentation, because many of the best surgery faced with all of these things. It does not ring. Oh, you like to start with? Well, I need to get everything done. Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing. Okay, we don't do that. No, could you do breast implants though? Uh, I can't be done. It's the lotion in the basket. How much? Uh, 5000. Excellent. I'd like to have my skin resurfaced too. Uh-huh. The laser surgery. Have the lambs stop crying yet, mommy. Excuse me? Don't hurt mommy's little baby. It works the lotion in the basket. I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw to be. Okay. Can you make me look more like a woman? Well, we'll have to see you first, and then if I'm looking actually, we can tell you that only to you. Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts, mommy? Uh, if you'd like to. It works the lotion in the basket. Would you like to make it a point, ma'am? There. Okay. If there is a hundred dollar consultation fee. That's fine. Okay. My name is buffer, Bill. Okay. Let me get a little information from you. Okay. I promise you. It's much the lotion in the basket. I understand. It puts the lotion in the basket. Do you want to come in for consultation? It works the lotion in the basket. Okay. Would you like to make it a point, ma'am? Do you want to call me back? Yeah. It's the lotion in the basket. I got my skin shooting at bonnet glaze. Bill. It puts the lotion in the basket. I understand that. Would you like to make it a point? It puts the lotion in the basket. Okay. I will talk to you in the time. It puts the lotion in the basket. Oh, we just play that for a four hour. Oh, God. It's 10.03. It's 50.05. 60. I'm happy Monday to you. I'm sweating from. Oh, man. And of course, if you didn't see the sounds of the land, what's so funny? Showcase teller. Still hasn't. One. Jochen on the last school has you playing it? We're sitting here like with tears running down our eyes and Joe's a little, wood soup, what are you about that? Okay. Well, hey, listen, nobody's perfect. You see that nose. So anyway, you know, I go away for a weekend for a couple days. I just go out of town a little bit. Come back and old governor, bump in the heat cool dies. He's your god. I hell of a lot of nerven. Buddy, if he cares about two happy bodies, he's probably thinking, man, what can you do this if you're going to do this? Why not do it a couple months sooner? And you noticed by the way, they found his body just a few feet away from his George X your size bike. Well, of course, now that George is like filling you when I go on vacation, you're like when I take along, you know, extra hour and a week in like Friday. What did George give me for my birthday this year? And even came over to the house to put together to make sure I would use it right away and a lot. An exercise bike. How do you like that? Oh, hey. And go for a bump and dies just a few. Now, here's the guy with an enlarged heart. 68 years old. What the hell is he doing in there with all these exercises? Huh? What's he doing in there, uh, puffin and huffin? It's a, and then I love this article of a paper like they know. They found his body seven and a half hours after he died. But it says, uh, let's see. Oh, maybe it was not in the neighborhood in the, uh, sunset. One moment please. Okay. One moment please. Because they've got it all figured out. It says, uh, with his brain, the private, uh, yeah, he, uh, his heart began beating theoretically during a regular workout because of his, uh, normally a large start with his brain deprived of oxygen. You need lost consciousness and slipped off a stationary bike. His death was probably quick and painless according to a preliminary. Huh? How do they know that? They don't know that. Proliminary autopsy said it was a quick and painless, right? So, but in the case, really pissed off because now he gets to the governor for, uh, what, two little over two weeks and that's the end of that. And Jeff Bush is, uh, kissing the ground boy. If this were to happen a couple of months ago, we would have no governor boots. I tell you that. By the way, speaking of boots, boots, boots. You better boot you up a little bit over there at the orange ball. You have something to do with the blue. I saw the news last night. I saw that ridiculous crap. Well, I saw two pieces. I guess it was this morning on channel 7. More menacing queens there at the big celebration last night with the balloons. Well, I guess it is legal at least to blow balloons anyway. Huh? Yeah, well, if you're going to put your energy into something, you might as well be blowing balloons. And so they had all those balloons going the 500 or so gay whites as supporters there after Celebrating the passage of the gay white Jordan and today county. Oh, there you go. And of course, leave it to the media to always, uh, you know, find the frutus and, and of course, they're, they're stopping around busting these balloons. Uh, which makes them look even frutier than they would have been a bit of just been standing there, uh, doing whatever they would have been doing. So, on the one hand, we had that. Then on the other hand, we go over and see the, the scene from the orange ball where these crazy spikes, they wanted 100,000 people to show up their Saturday night to protest the passage, you know, the protest, uh, anti-discrimination law to show the world that we still can be bigoted against those Madacones. And I think they just, the 100,000, they came close. They just left the 1000 off. They had the 100, but they, the 1000 part was the part that they missed. Yeah, it looked like there was a smattering. 2000, my ass. Okay. There was a couple of hundred misfits there. And they dragged, they slept along their kids to make it to inflate the kind of make it look good. And, and the whole thing by the way, was in Espanol. They played a little bit of the audio. That's it. That's it. That's it. That was it. As usual. Oh boy. What a world, huh? What a crazy world. And then, of course, Joe de Mayo. He just keeps hanging in there and he is pissed off. He is fired up and pissed off. He's had it. He's sick and tired of the guy damn media sticking there. No, he's in there and all of these false reports. He said, as he took one or two breaths. Why can't they just, and I agree with him. Okay. Why can't they just let this man die with a little bit of dignity? Why is it that every time he fights? We have to read about it. Find out what flavor it was. How long it lasted that he sneaked. It was like a, you know, did it stain the sheet? Something like that. Why do we have to find out about that? Why can't they let this poor ugly old fart die in peace? Which would be symbolic, I think, because baseball has died over the weekend. What's amazing? Governor dies? No, you don't remember. You don't remember sending the Morris you go from Utah? Mo you go? No. No, come on. Tell me you're joking. Who ran for president like before you were born? You don't remember. You don't remember. No. Former Utah Senator, Democrat. Good guy. Like the outdoors. He was like one of those you will give him guys. You need to bark off the trees. Good guy. Did. But baseball's dead because they just gave Kevin Brown. Now keep in mind, here is a guy who's a pitcher. I don't care if he's the best pitcher in the history of the game, which he's not. So a pitcher plays every four or five days. Okay, not an everyday player. He plays every four or five days. And a few years ago, as a three or four years ago, when the Braves gave Greg Maddox six million dollars a year, a pitcher. Very good one. But nevertheless, everybody said, oh my god, here that's that's ridiculous. And I'm acceptable amount for a pitcher who only plays every four or five days. Well, hey, listen, sparing no expense. The doctor said, hey, how about 15 million year for seven years for Kevin Brown? Will be 41 years old by the time that contract is. Anybody think he's going to be picking up the time he's 41 years old? No. Hey, listen, 105 million for seven years, 15 million year for a pitcher. For baseball player, for a guy that wears a jox trap. For a guy who on the one hand talked all about his allegiance and how he wanted to stay here two years ago after he helped the Marlins win the championship. Then went to San Diego, helped them again in the World Series. And then a jump ship against because he's nothing but another war, okay. He's nothing but a war. I mean, I'm sure San Diego would have paid him like, you know, a few million year. Could he have scraped by on maybe a few million year? I'm going to probably squeed by. But these guys are all who are at least just around for a little while, okay. Like a couple of years would make it look good. 15 million year, I'm going to tell you, they can take baseball. You know what you can do with your baseball? That's what you can do with it, okay? I'm out. Not that it's going to make any difference, but I'm on the outside looking. I want nothing to do with that crap. These people have taken leave of their census baby. They've lost total contact and they expect you best you to keep paying for it. That's the best part. More and more and more. Oh, and if you'll just, oh, like Gary Beckman just told the people in Phoenix, if you're building a arena there for the coyotes, we'll have the all-star game there. All right. Sound familiar? 9 minutes after 10 is 5.50 WQA. Why didn't he arrest him for saying, Nikki, my few mother f***er. I say, come over here, you f***er. I'll knock you out. That's all I said. It's not heavy on. It's no perian. It's not even tap water. Oh, oh, oh, tastes like p***. It is. The new bottled water. It tastes like p*** because it is. You're in for a tree. The new bottled p*** water. The next time you want to quit your thirst, take a p***. It's water. From kidney bottled in company, golden, shower, Colorado. It's probably not a p***. It's probably a p***. It means you're used to call it stroze. I think 10-15 at 5.50 WQA in. So not only is the right to the world totally confounded, but there was over there with Aerofar right now speaking and the gasses strip there are doing it. Not only are they totally perplexed and confounded about all this Republican mania, this little lynch mob, we got going to watch it. But the markets man are taking a gigantic, wow. You watch. You watch already down 79 this morning the Dow and going to drop like a rock. Just a total bunch of crap. That's right. Because we have a bunch of lunatics. Has anything changed in his last QAIS this on Friday? Any new information? No. Anything changed. But all of a sudden they've decided, well, he should resign. He's a liar. He's a purger. I don't get it. There's absolutely not one shred, one piece of new evidence that they've gotten in his last two, three weeks. And now we've gone from G. We wish we could get this over with right away. And let's find a graceful way to get over, which was right after the election. To now all of a sudden, oh, yeah, let's let's put the country through a long, long impeachment trial in the Senate. And if he wants to avoid that, he can resign. It's part of the fact that the overwhelming majority of the people, including millions who never voted for me either time, don't want that. Don't confuse the sanctimonious assholes on the right with the truth. Okay. That's right. They can't deal with it. Had a good day on Friday for a Senate one by the way, they did a thousand forty six. Thanks to Sam and Chris by the way for sticking around. However, long may stuck around at that location. Raise the thousand forty six bucks there and then to your game last night. They had a few of the best of stuff and raised four hundred and ten there. So that's fourteen fifty six. So our grand total eighty two thousand and two dollars is a plus whatever we got from quarters last week and on the internet and on the whatever else. So we got to be right around eighty five thousand. And today's the fourteenth. We got right on schedule. Baby, are we going to make that hundred grand? You've let your sweet answer we are. And maybe today are they going to be out in the van today, by the way, I'm assuming I'm hoping I'm waiting to find out. I'm doing this I can try to quit somebody on the phone. Are they going to be out somewhere? They'll be somewhere. Okay. They'll be somewhere. So we can do another grand on that today and I'm sure Carol any second now any minute any hour any day. She's going to be affecting us be update with the borders information. I guarantee you are right around at that eighty five thousand mark. Now you can almost smell that hundred grand total. Can't you? And like I said the other day we're not worried about it because if we come up a few thousand short I'm sure that Bruce Beesley personally. I'm going to be Carolyn Beesley. We'll write out a show right out. Check it'll say now don't cash until the year twenty five twenty five. They'll write out a check for us. No problem at all. So we'll learn a lot of things in the song. A lot of people just draw here at times because the often boss the game last night. Sony a game. Sony a game. Sony a game. Okay. So football games. Not the end of the world. It's the same old craft no offense. No one a game. Same simple bull crap. It's always been for years and years. You got really boring and ponders. I said I don't need this. Who the hell needs this? And I didn't miss that Calgary game against the Panthers Saturday. They must have been a real exciting game. Real snoozer. I saw some of the low lights. I saw two greasy goals that Kirk McLeod and they're that wrap around. Oh Jesus. And I wonder what like right between his legs there. I'm afraid that Kirk McLeod is starting to revert to true form and Sean Burke is already playing exactly his true form. So looks like real problems. And then again, I pick up yesterday's paper and the Sun Sentinel just hysterical. You fed idiot you, you fed putwacker Michael Russo there to Sun Sentinel. Who writes an article about, you know, we don't have columnist in this town. I've totally this before. What we have are people who are the tools for the propaganda machine. The for the Panther organization. That's right. All of you are a propaganda for the organization. Right. So it's big solid today. It's about. Well, later on he writes about how the beezers have problems in filly in their upset with him up there to say percentages low and yada yada yada yada which is all true. But nevertheless, would we rather have the beezer than the two goofballs we got now? You bet your ass. But his main thrust is the penguins want to unload stew barns. They've demoted into the fourth line and yada yada. And it's very obvious this article with this column was written before certain ice game. They're getting over saying Louis 4 to 3 which do barns court is their teeth cold decision. And he starts out the column by saying, well, you know, that Chris Wells for stew barns thing may not be the end of the world now. Because stew is pissed off. He's got that was his third teeth goal. Have the panthers got anybody with 13 goals. The block has got 14 by the way. We got anybody with 14 anybody with 13 anybody with 12 anybody with 11. Anybody besides rookie Mar parish with 10. I just thought I would ask that question. Okay. But again, here we go spinning trying to convince the fans trying to convince the public out there that that was really a great move. By the way, Chris Wells played one game at the season. No, go to any goals. No. And he assists. Can prove anything to this organization this year? No. Okay. But he looks good in the suit up there in the stands. Whatever. Whatever he's hanging out who knows. So you come back to reality when you come back to this town. You open up your newspaper and you read more. That never ends. Never ends. More propaganda. Not people who know their subject matter, who know what they're writing about, who can really make a statement, make a critique, make a whatever it is, positive, negative in between whatever the hell it might be. Just a bunch of ass suckers, just a judyfully writing whatever they're told the right. Same old tired. That's right. That's the journalism in this town. Bull crap. Here's a great article. Greg Reid pointed this off to me in a paper this morning, which I had missed. And from the Netherlands, no less. Vindication is music to the ears of pilot who sang sky high notes. A Dutch pilot was unjustly barred from an airport in the northern Netherlands for continually singing the theme of the Flintstone's over as radio and appeals board as ruled. Wim Denise. Then ice. News. Better known in Holland is Captain Flinskin. I like that better. I've taken this case to the Dutch Council of State after the airport in the city of Grunigan. And it forbidden him to take off Orlando from March 1996 to July 1997. Last year, Denice was briefly jailed by authorities who said he tied up a frequency used by air traffic controllers. When he bellowed out the theme song to the popular cartoon series, Flintstones meet the Flintstones. There are modern stone age family in English for 20 minutes at a time. There you go. What's wrong with that? Wouldn't you be at you being a good mood if you're on a plane in the pilot or a ticket over the intercom? Flintstones make the Flintstones. What's wrong with that? I think it's kind of amusing. Leave it to those Dutch. Probably some bad weed. But leave it to the Dutch man. The Council of State considered they need to keep the airways safe but said on Friday the Ban was too harsh. Let him have his phone. Okay. As long as he's flying to plain straight, not too cocky.

Well, we don't have time to worry about social security or health care because we took these clients and they're trying to put in because you got a couple of loads on that. That's where their head is at, right? You're right. You're absolutely right. What's going on right now, you're so criminal and so unacceptable and the media are too guy-d-in stupid or too stubborn do what to tell a like it is. You got your fingers up, well, you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, you know what I'm saying, we'll never need a pro-tologist if they're perfect at all. Exactly. He's an ass. Okay, pal, hang in there. Okay, I have a great life. We have an open line and proud one at date, five six seven five fifty, pound five sixty on a mobile one line. Our band is going to be where? Well, here eventually, you know, soon we'll find out where it's going to be. What are you smoking about? I mean, I just, I'm, I'm anxious. I want to get up to that 90 granting before standard. I want to go over 100 grand and I'm going to take, I'm going to take a piece of paper that's got our final set of one total, come, January second this year after the new year's holiday and I'm going to shove it right up, buddy, never in rectum. That's what I'm going to do. Because as far as the rest of the media in this counter-concuren, we could be sitting here. I could raise a million dollars for what you fill in the blank, whatever charity will be. And I still wouldn't put anything in there about it. But if it's Wayne Heizinger, or if somebody just donated a hundred dollars to the Danny Marino Foundation, right away it's in here because they're all sucking each other's ass. But because I won't play that game and I won't sit here and cover up for them and their bullcraft that they keep feeding the public, then I'm a bad guy, so no matter what you'll try to do, just like that Diane Magnum piece. For whatever reason, I'm on a plane yesterday and I started thinking about that. Boy, did I get snuckered in again or what, huh? Yeah. Use me in my audience to try to goose your numbers up there during the swoops. But let's not the way thing that would make Neil look too good, okay? And let's kind of twist and manipulate whatever he told us just however we want. And certainly don't promote him in any way, or tell anybody what station he's on or what time he's on or that he does raise any of this money or that this center one thing is going on. Don't do that, God forbid. What a place this is, man. Here's Boca, hello. Boca. Okay, nice talking to you too. Open line a day one at Broward 560, 560, 560, 560, on the mobile one line. I wonder what your jacket that was. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. Neil, how you doing? Okay. Tell him how big it is. What do you think of the X-Cautible Hotel? I don't. Okay, we have an open line at Broward 560, 560, 560, 560, on the mobile one line. Here's Virginia key, Neil. Yes, sir. Only because you asked, I can tell you about the hecoon. Yeah. That's kind of boring, but one call I would call before was, you know, he touched on a little bit. But what did it, you remember last time when Governor Bunkin beat Bush in the, you know, did you do what it was? Yes. Well, basically was like the, the Paul's all favored Bush. And it's like a South Florida North Florida type, a battle that the media tried to portray, to try to make it more interesting. And up in North Florida, he got all the, you've heard of the term before, a cracker, right? Yes. Yeah, we'll, we'll Governor Bunkin. I was here 22 years ago. I know my Florida type. Okay. Okay. The, the he, since the media had him losing, the hecoon is, is the leader of the pack. He's very smart and cunning and he wants it. Night. And what that, what his, his, his remark was that overnight, he became the leader and he beat Bush out. Yeah. And, and, and, and, and, and, and, the Bush was your overnight. Yeah, the, the, the Bush overnight. And Bush was using his, the fact that he married Aladdin woman, because you know, all the, all the latins down here are Republican because of, uh, because, uh, because that was communist, the right exactly. But he was, there's communist. He was exactly. So Bush was, or speaking, Aladdin, and all the latins down here South Florida, we're just going nuts and jumping up and down like a bunch of, uh, much of tribal idioms. Yeah. Yeah. When he's done on a call and my call, may say that a couple of times, they really got into it. So that's basically what it's, uh, He never lost an election did he governor bonkin? He never did he? He really kicked ass in it. The old he cool would come out of the woods there at night and beat the old bushes and Sneak up on him when he leased expected exactly. So you've heard the term pixie crowd also. Yeah, where that's that's basically redneck up And yeah, well, he wasn't a dixie crowd. That's actually No, no, Charles was not a dixie crowd. You don't think so. Grant was like a strong sermon There were Republicans dressed in drag pretending to be Democrats. Yeah, yeah, you're right. You're right. That's he would no dixie crowd Any other questions? Yes, sir return to Santa okay. Thank you and have a great life All right, we're getting a good education here today. We're getting a little history lesson about the old he cool and the he cool is dead I see they don't care about that They're more concerned about guy damn jolt and jota mangeo. That's what we're supposed to be excited about governor of the state dies dies 68 and that's a teenager in this state 68. That's not so old dead Does anybody care no no Jota mangeo they're worried about And I saw there were shawnts and clips again in him this morning. I'm gonna tell you something because I I haven't you know seen him at a long time Here's one guy. They usually say most people in their life look good like he lea at one point in your life Maybe when your fetus you look a little okay. This man was ugly for a bad as a fetus. He was grotesque He was one of the ugliest mothers I have ever seen in my life So a mirror that must have seen something maybe he had a Didn't need the eye something 1056 in 560 WQA Anyone the Neil Roger show now on 560 WQA Miami Fort Latterdale then coat hit away from the ball motherfucker So anyway We're expecting Phil's saltman to call any second now I'm the food is here.

Yeah, you know the rest of the whole world Not just the Palestinians in the Israelis the whole goddamn world is looking upon this country and what's going on here Like there's some kind of a mental problem here and that's what's wrong because we have a sexually constipated country and one party That's totally sexually neurotic into out of their minds These sexually neurotic Republicans that's what we have now and a entire party has been mesmerized by the far right extremist wing That used to be called a bunch of lunatics like clandman is generally what they used to call them and now they've taken over the whole goddamn party And I'm the guys have been concerned about the law and the principle of the constitution and yet pop pop all this other bullcraft They're gonna drag us to a pilot manure the likes of which you've never smelled in your goddamn the likes of which the he cool never smelled That's right crack with a capital K We have two open lines in date five six seven oh five sixty pomp five sixty on the AT and two wireless ones and of course Since it's not partisan naturally they're not going to allow this censure That measure to come up for debate in the house on the floor in the full house this Thursday They're not going to allow that to come up there because God forbid somebody might actually say okay That makes more sense. Let's get this over with in censure the the bathroom Maybe won't do it again or if he does we don't have to hear about it No, we can't do that we have to drag out all this bullcraft because this is payback time.

I he was a little boy the only thing I wish he wouldn't have lost that 12 bucks as a kid which made him so anti gambling and so good at issues on that issue but other than that he was a he was oh yeah yeah I agree on that issue he was very happy quite a lot of people he's going to go down his one of the best okay he's had but anyway good talking to you then when you're next to the period and after the one of McDonald's today.

crying laughing and I you pull me up and then the first thing I don't want to know was you let's do those shouldn't be asking for you on your promise and I had this great I thought that would I thought that was it you thought I was cranking it no I just thought that that was uh you're coming now that was it I had a whole lot of things I wanted to talk to you about especially Joe to Maggio yeah if I lived the game you do it by the way he's not so good no if I lived a 84 years old I mean you know just plot me in the ground I'm not that's enough exactly I mean what are they going to do

point it's kissing round and say god I guess I've been pretty god damn lucky for 84 years right this point I agree and also was married to Merlin Marlond Marlond for a little while or two he's a nice little guy he bitch in a bottle he's a nice little bastard especially when you look like that I mean I didn't know hit he had or how many you know 56 great games but good god yeah but that was that really bad eyesight that was making note two that was before we started playing these pairs 50 million dollars for can you believe that that sucks I don't I I mean you know so so basically like the guy said before if you're in New York Los Angeles or Atlanta which has got TBS with a big TV contract if if you've got an basically limitless amount of funds that you can spend if you go out and pay 100 million 200 million here we don't give a crap and uh you people and are other Marlond Marlond you are going to be able to compete so good luck to you that's right he guy is on any such an addition of course and if you do want to compete then you're going to have to start raping your fan to you more than you already are and doubling the ticket prices which nobody will put up with that definitely he either right on the head when he said just start to play out with the Orioles the Yankees the Ray Dodgers and the Brad right there you go that's not mean that's ridiculous I I boycott all baseball I am so glad that the NBA strike is I'm really sad that it's coming to an end because those big monkeys don't deserve the money and the best thing that ever happened to literacy in America is the NBA

our goal of a hundred grand we won't get to sand's goal of three hundred grand but you know but if we're going to if we're going to purposely pick out spots where we don't have any audience it would seem to me that these guys would have a better grasp maybe they like to chicks up there in my me likes maybe that's what they're looking for or maybe it's close to nearby shoelas and they think they can stop over there and get a free meal or something but it would seem to me that there are many many many parts of town in fact broadward quite frankly I think we're going to do a lot better I'm trying to think about their places in date county where we might have an audience other than where we've already been do we have an audience in date county oh no I don't like down in color rage which

We have an open line at date county, 560, 560, 560 on a mobile one line. Our poll question today, who was more important in the nature of human events? And of course, of American history. Lawton, Charles, or Joe de Mazio, that's our poll question today. Or Elvis Presley, there you go. That's the choice. We've added Governor Bumpkin in there now and honor of his memory.

Nice goal on the other poll. I'll request between now and holidays. To get us through the end of the year. If we heard from one woman today, oh yeah, we did have one. That's right. One or two. They're playing hard to get throughout their busy light in the Manorra. They're out there nailing Mazio's on the adore frames of Graham all over time. That's the new plot, by the way. Because of all this intermarriage, all this interfaith marriage, crap that's going on. And the gene pool is being watered down and watered down the Jewish genetic gene pool to a precious few. So as a result, we're going to have to start nail up Mazio's on door frames of Graham to make them think that they're Jewish. Here's Miami. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Yeah, I just want to say I love the show and I hope you have a great holiday. And I got a request for the Scottish bagpipe. All right. All right. I have a happy panel. There you go. I'll request, day baby. We're doing it over here. Are we getting any reports from them over there? Because I had to take the key plug on that place. Because I think, you know, it's up to them. They're the ones who are selecting these places. But the less said the better. Okay, George is picking up the instrument right now. Is that them? Because we had a lot of the last number you gave me was like 120 bucks. If we're going to do 120 bucks every half hour, they're going to have to be there until about two o'clock in the morning. We reached a thousand. Okay, with my arithmetic last time I figured, like I said, they're going to have to be there until Wednesday midnight. Was that them? Oh. So there are out there on the northeast corner of the Palmetto with 67. And the McDonald's parking lot with all of our best stuff. They got free dolphin t-shirts.

But it's getting closer and closer that he's voting like every two weeks on, with like 46% said, yes, and 53 per or four percent said no. And of course worth it. And hey, we don't care what you say because there's no chance. Not that we have anything against Puerto Ricans. We have many fine Puerto Ricans citizens who live here in South Florida. Well, I shouldn't use the word citizens. We have many illegal aliens here. And now that's an interesting point. I never stopped and think about that. If people come from the Virgin Islands or from Puerto Rico, I guess it's not possible for them to be illegal aliens. Is it their citizens? I burn. Right. That's what I'm saying. So why you make an up stories about illegal aliens from Puerto Rico? Why'd you say that? Okay. Where we going here is, uh, what's the bomb B. Jell-O. Hey, Neil.

That's our pull question today. Who's more important, Earl Morrell or Joe de Maggio? Who's got a better haircut? Not a bad guy, Earl Morrell, a little bit more white wing than I. But he's not a bad guy. What is he? He was the sheriff of David of nottingham. Here you go. They're showing it again. Look at that. December 4th through the sixth. Well, I don't get that. What do they just show there? That was bizarre. Okay. Here's the approval writing over the weekend. 64% approval, Baba. 34 say they disapproved. And only 2% are stupid enough. They don't know who he is. 64% approval rating. And this is after the house, you this year, a committee votes out these four articles of speechmen. Okay. After these got that they just refused to get the message. They're all going to wind up with no language. They're going to wind up their an entry up in the woods.

This is really great. What? This isn't a lighter. This is a freaking torch. Or we're not smoking in here. Are we smoking stokees in here? Uh-huh. We're better not do that. We move upstairs. Anyway, I got a million calls on here, which we'll get to. But there's a big article in here this morning. The battle for fans. This is incredible. Listen to town where there are some people who are getting on the verge of asking for a public money to build a new baseball stadium. Softboard is crowded. Sports scene creating problems and empty stadiums. It's a. Sports owners try to stay positive despite dwindling attendance. And it talked about the metaphors who aren't drawn flies and about their hurricanes about their football attendance. And they're invisible basketball crowds, which there was anybody there. And the fusion. With their horrendous average attendance 10,284 in soccer. Ranking only ahead of Kansas City in the 12 team league. And about the. What is that indoor soccer team? Everything I got the Thundercats. There you go. Keep the seats are $8. Our well-short of league 6,000 per game average last season. Even though they made an ambitious effort to reach fans by participating in dozens of community events. And it goes on and out about the 8,000 on sol tickets for the offense. Rams game and about the two games that had to be picked up by Channel 4. Or they would have been blacked up. More and more stadiums. More and more arena is more overpaid. A liter of dumb jokes. That's what we need there you go. I think finally we're reaching that point. We're reaching the point of saturation and people are just learning to say. Just like Nancy Reagan would tell you. Just say the overpaid, a liter of dumb jokes. And then we can talk about important things on this station like Joe de Mazzio. Here's Hylia. Hello. Yes sir. How are you doing sir? I just wanted to say I love you, show and I want to wish you a good holidays. And I have a shame as you request. Yes sir. Farewell to ILD please. Okay. See you. How about goodbye I do your farewell. Oh by the way, Book of Ryanville's new don't come into the unless you don't want to get paid. Well I forgot to bring him a check because I didn't get home at a plane to the land to late last night. And I got in the car just in time to hear why there was not tell you what. There was no laughter coming from Bill's in for the anonymous dolphin broadcast your last night. I got him. My car was 1120 Eastern Standard Time. At Miami International Airport. Getting in the car turned on the radio of course there's QAM and there's him first notting like his puppy just had bad diarrhea on the living room floor with a heavy household guests. He sounded really depressed and the dolphins were driving for a touchdown and you could hear a pin drop. So obviously was a meaningless touchdown. The game was just about over and it was. No laughter from him. And again I'm taking it myself. He's not bad. It's not that he does a bad job. Even though he's like colorless he's he's you know he's okay. But the fact that he doesn't live here that he's not an identity like Hank will tell you all the time. Nobody knows who the hell he is. If you ask who's on the dolphin broadcast. 99 out of 100 people are say manage. And they'll say yeah well he does the color but who does the play by play and I'll go. I don't know. Here's Holly would. Hello. Hey deal what's up. How you doing sir? So the best one could see nothing open up again. Yeah. Oh yeah my life card right in front of it. The traffic to get in that place is horrible. Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm running spots for it here on our station so they must be doing something. Yeah. I'm going to take anybody's money. I'm going on a trip to Europe on Sunday. The plane trip is about 10 hours long. Is it like. Is it like bad turbulence from here to Europe or something? Oh man you better hang on tight sweetheart. Oh really better take some. Well what is their bad turbulence? I mean it's like the side right sometimes there is sometimes it's a smooth as gliding on a on a on a pond. It's all you depends on a luck. Oh man I hope I get a smooth flight ever request. Bring it to be why old be bring your own bar bag. Yes. Can I hear a guilty? Okay you got it. All right. Every good time. Sounds good luck to you. It's going to be really choppy up there. I'll tell you what things flying up over the weekend Friday. You're just to Lake Eury. I'm going to tell you I've hit about 40 seconds with a turbulence like I haven't hit in a long time in a plane. I mean real nasty turbulence and the guy sitting next to me says that's a little more turbulence that I care for. It's not like that. Some silly Canadian thing you said. And I said how's it going? Really nasty. In fact the last time I can be called that it's about three or four years ago. You get that a lot in the summertime at Atlanta. Not always a pain in the ice flying around Atlanta. In the bad airport not because it's so goddamn congested. And a lot of times you have to like circle the airport for about a half hour until you get clearance to land. That's that's really annoying when you got a connection and you know you're already where you're going. But they keep circling and certain because they got away for clearance to land because they can't land everybody at the same time. But boy they get some of those summer storms in Atlanta. And then of course the other place where like from May until October. There's very often real bad turbulence because it's storming and storming and raining and puking out of want to say this data Florida. Woo you can fly all the way from Europe and back and we've had this experience. Smooth as a sheet of ice. Or at least as smooth as a sheet ice as supposed to be but not in the NHL. And then you get to the state of Florida all of a sudden you're rocking in jam and you just right a pukier guts out. But anyway have a great flight pal piece of cake. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Hey, Neil. How you doing? Great. It's almost good to see a vice. If you just change a letter and the NHL. Did you go to the Vancouver Game last week? The Vancouver Game? Yeah, the Vancouver.

Was that a movie? I was a movie. I'm thinking we're a window. I'm sorry. That was just listening to this crap. That's right. I was that out because the I've been reading skating.

Anyway. Oh, we don't. Here's a mobile and cool spring. Hello. Hey, hey, doing great. Great. You know, I wanted to say something about Rodden Child. I kind of liked him. You know, the only thing I could have ever opposed him with was this gambling. Yeah. Well, he lost 12 bucks as a 12 year old kid and he just, you know. Yeah, but at least he kept it personal. He didn't try to make it some religious crazy. And nothing. And about the Clinton, I just, I knew David Schippers and Chicago. And he did that guy used to be an incredible prosecutor fighting the mob and everything like that. But he's become such a, he just become a stank demonious, a hired gun for a bunch of religious scholars. Yeah. And so you have a great plan. His, yeah, of you to his explanation and his, his, his stained outrage there. And at closing argument that they were such garbage on and on and kept repeating the same thing. Over and over again. I mean, this is, this is an endurance contest. These guys are basically subjecting the American public to what endurance kind of how long before you and they'll president they finally just can't take it anymore. It's they okay. We, we all give up. That's what it's all about. Is there anybody to want to see one more minute of this crack? Oh, man. The only people who wanted to go on forever MSNBC and CNN those are the only ones that care because they're ratings have zoomed up every ten they put his garbage on there. Of course, what would you rather see? Would you rather hear the see the hearings? Or would you rather see Don I'm sitting in a chair talking with his brother Fred on the farm again? Jesus, I don't understand. I just don't get it. I do not get it. And I'm a, I'm a, I'm a span from years ago. I'll say it again for the 500 times back in the days when he was hysterically funny. He was a real talent. And now all of a sudden he's making more money than ever before. They just signed him for another 500 years. In fact, that's even worse than signing the Kevin Brown. Seven years. He's going to be 41 years old, but that contract expires. Is there anybody in this room who believes that he's still going to be a picture when he's 41 years old? Oh, for his five, for his 15 million a year. No. I hope that Dodgers take a real gigantic is what I hope. I hope they lose a hundred games this year. Here's Pepper Pine, tell us. No. Yes, I am. Deal. Yes. Love yourself. Ah, not in child. You know, is that? Me? Was it an order don't they? Like a throwback or what? What is it? He did take like an order.

I think that was my a cab driver from Toronto. 5 670 560 and Pomp 560 on the mobile one line. Here's coconut creak. Hello. Yes sir. Are you doing nail? Great. I'm not from Brown. But I am enjoying the show today. I'm a child. I'm going to buy a bus and visit a buddy of mine. I've been listening to sports all week on this station. You don't want to hear that crap. Well, I just was curious if that's. Do you talk about sports at all? No, no, no, absolutely. You're not. Why is he wanted to get a little bit. We're trying to do a format in their loot. We don't want these people to become neurotic and obsessed with stuff. They're really is not that important. Well, actually the grandfgainet things for politics and important. But I just just a little message for you guys. I don't know. What do you mean for you guys? I'm pretty popular in Boston. I'm on the sports talk show. Oh, good. Okay. And then that's the first indication that you're off of this one. He's pretty popular on the sports show. In other words, code for on a chronic color. Well, sir, we got enough chronic colors of our own here. We don't need him for it from Boston. Okay. Go call any anilman. Go call somebody that wants to talk to you. Okay. Go talk to the ghost. The jury Williams on a weekend. Get out of here. Can you believe that? I'm pretty popular on the talk shows up there in Boston. So I thought I'd come down here. I mean, why does anybody go on vacation or whatever he's doing down here for the holidays, maybe? And it's a kind of talk show. So you got a problem while you're up there and you can't leave it behind. You need therapy. You're a chronic talk show color. No matter where you go. At least one thing about our chronic course. Our chronic never leave time anyway. That's the problem. They don't go anywhere. We have an open line at Broward 2 in the day. They're the other way around. However, we got the couple lines. 560, 505, 60, 50, 50, 50, 50, 50 on the mobile one line. That's great. That was good too. That was beautiful. I'm a chronic in Boston. Can I become a chronic down here on this station? No. Here's Fort Myers. Hello. Yeah. That's the first time caller. And I really like to show. And I have a question. I agree with you on the impeachment. That impeachment Clinton is anyway getting a moment started. The people against the panel, the guy's a guest ship. Yeah. I'm getting a movement started in Fort Myers. That's not easy. Well, I don't. But I mean across the country, you know, people don't get out of here. How are we going to start a movement? I don't know. That's why I'm asking you. Sure. If I had any idea of how we, I mean, you got to call your congressmen. You can email your congressmen. You can send them a singing telegram. Whatever. Whatever. You think we'll do it. Yeah. I think that's what's going to happen. You don't like that. I'm going to tell you one thing that I know for sure. The people are highly motivated. They're going to be a couple of calls. They're going to be manning the phones. And they can aid billion for a phone call. You know, all week long. You know, that's going to be going on. All right. I know. I just agree with everything that's going on. And I agree with you. Hold hard. We've got to stop this. Well, make a couple of calls, pal. I will. Okay. We have an open line of day to a Broward. And like the lady called with playshaws. Number here last week through the Friday. Whatever day it was. We're whoever the hell we want to call and get with it. Of course, then there's always Iliana Gross late then. Are we going to worry about her? No, Rosemba was in a 10 on a bed day. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pump. 5 60 on a mobile one line. What's the story with our WQA in van? By the way, now the times of wasting it's almost 1 o'clock. 502. Still in the same spot. Yeah. And they're getting ready to pack up and go. They're getting ready to pack it. And they're going to go to the hooters on times and universe. Oh, yeah. They're going to hooters. This deal is all about they're going to hooters. Is where they're going. This isn't about raising money for charity. This is about salmon Chris getting late. Is that all about there you go. Now if we can do both at the same time. I say more power to you guys. It's about raising money for charity and salmon Chris getting a piece of ass. That's what this is all about. Or more than one is the case may be. What if you want to go to peace? How about going over to the kernels? Oh, I saw the abio him on any Harlem Sanders. Did you ever see that? Pretty interesting for a a question you'll fart. Even as chicken wasn't as crusty as he was. But he went and you know, and that's a nice, that's our new full question. Can't us must much. Colonel Sanders or Colonel Parker. They're all they're both there anyway. Were you fudge back him? Good bye. I'll see the memories of that. All that left of a station that once had been. And for aum that was quite a plain. Hot and packed and burned, saying. Do blow it all in. When they build those condos and blocks that tower off. You'll be lower down into your grave. And you were great at one time, but now you stop or lie. A sick little gripping in the wind. And you'll never see numbers you can sell again. Yet clear candle notes what they're doing. But so they seem to know what's listening in the more. He talks they really seems. Good bye. I'll be let go of Gregor. Skip the proof that the rest of that retarded team. That remains a tax and soul regime. Clear candle has a scheme. But it's clear to see that. Despite all their core for it and jingling, they can't hide the fact. Without feeling they got a crappy deal. And you were great at one time, but now you stop or lie. You're sick little gripping in the wind. And you'll never see numbers you can sell again. Yes clear candle notes what they're doing. So they say no one's listening. And we want to talk they really seem. This is Debbie. Well hi Debbie. I'm a student getting through operations done. Okay. Thanks and body contouring in some liposuction. And I was wondering if it's coming up and the lip augmentation has many requests. So do you face it? All of these things. It does. It's wondering. More extra work. Well I need to get everything done. Probably the first thing I'd like to have removed is my thing. Okay we don't do that. No. Could you do breast implants though? I can't be done. I mean the lotion in the basket. How much? 5000. Excellent. I'd like to have my skin resurface too. The laser surgery. Have the limbs stop crying yet. Mommy. Excuse me. Don't hurt Mommy's little baby. It works the lotion in the basket. I'd like to get the liposuction that I saw on TV. Okay. Can you make me look more like a woman? Well we'll have to see you first. And then I'm looking actually. We can tell you that only to you. Should I wear my skin suit made of body parts? Mommy. If you'd like to. It works the lotion in the basket. Would you like to make an appointment? Yes. Okay. If there is a hundred dollar consultation fee. That's fine. Okay. Okay. My name is Buffalo Bill. Okay. Let me give you a little information from you. Okay. Why? Why? I'm the lotion in the basket. I understand. What's the lotion in the basket? Do you want to come in for consultation fee? What's the lotion in the basket? Okay. Would you like to make an appointment? Do you want to call me bad? Yeah. What's the lotion in the basket? I understand. I got my skin suit in the blanket. Oh. Bill. It works the lotion in the basket. I understand that. Would you like to make an appointment? It works the lotion in the basket. Okay. I will talk to you in the comments. It works the lotion in the basket. No. Okay. Yes. Hello. Okay. 12. 47. At 5. 60. WQA. We have an open line in the day two and brown. 5. 6. At 0. 5. At 0. 5. 6. At 0. 5. At 0. At 0. At 0. I'll get a good effect on such good results. Some events, some months later. Good results. If you claim about 2 sides is actually done, but it isn't. If you slowly approach something, the food will just cause yourun this item. If it takes time, you might go through it. And then what? Well you just do that. Good results. If you say something, you shall do that. Furniture is done. What's the time for the saturation? The saturation obviously is not A third level. And then 댓uring me, hey. a clinical, a legitimate clinical psychiatric disorder is chronic calls to talk shows. That's right. Beyond the shadow of an 11th saying that people used to say, oh, you are exaggerating. No way. I don't care. No matter what it is, no matter how rational, how normal, how real those people seem if their chronic colors on radio talk shows, they got a serious serious problem. And usually when you meet them, they got like one eye like strike-clops in middle before head. And you know, one year where their echo used to be, and that's right. Sirious problems. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Oh, yeah, Neil. Listen, has anybody told you that I forgot the guy's name, but he plays nickel and young in the rest of, do you know he has a band? Josh Morrell. Yeah. Do you know he has a band? No. Like, I guess I did read something about that. Yeah. It's kind of like, I see one of the boys in the band. Yeah. I guess he is. Oh, him and what was the guy's name? Or do you remember the guy that, uh, rape, sharing on the show like a couple years ago? He's named it was Matt. I mean, he's in some other show. Now, he made it to the big time that guy, I forget what show he's on. Matt. He's in the band with Nick. Yeah. I'll bet. It's him, uh, Nick and some other friends. And they're going to go over the band. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, the songs talked, but I felt maybe if you like the backstory boys in my life. No, come on. Don't say that. I'll give it to you. They're no back door boys. I don't know. I wouldn't know. Okay. Thanks for the good news in the Japanese New Year. What do you say? We have all three lives in day wide open, 560, 5050, 560 on the mobile one line. What? I thought you were going to go in parts and very important information there. Here. How is that possible? And I'm going to do a two for one. I never saw that happen before. Look at that. We got a dead heat. Wow. Here is West Palm Beach. Hello. Hello, Neil. Happy to be out of go. And back to you. Uh, you know, it was a shame to hear about the governor. He was a good guy because he took on its back home companies. Right. I think that's what he's going to be known for. You do? Uh, I'm all that other things. I don't think there was any other governor who was ever known as the heat cool. And I think that probably said some apart. I think it was, I think the, the way he used the nickname was more of what's like a wise thing. You know, he was like the wise old man and looked over everything. Uh, I think that's how he used it. I think my Clinton, no, just amazing. Uh, what would it pause me? And I feel back for the woman that her husband died. What, what right? Just very bone on that. He's a bubble head. She's a simple thing. She really isn't in an, in addition to which, by the way, if you were reading the tabloids like I've told you as your homework assignment, you discover that she's been having enough fear for a lot of how many years now with some guy that's funny, new about which is why he tried to change his will. Yeah. Chancid, everybody else, they got this thing tied up and probate now with sunny bono's will. And she turns out to be another Philanderer. And here, here we have another Stankton Monius hypocrite, just like Henry Heights sitting on the judicia repeatedly. And she's been screwing around for last 12 years. Exactly. Exactly. How do you like that? Oh, well, I don't like it. That's why I'm saying it. But the thing, the whole thing was Clinton, I'm watching. I couldn't watch it last week because I was so disgusted by what happened. I mean, we're did this come from all of a sudden. Two, three weeks ago after the elections in November that were saying, well, they wanted to go away. Now they get the message. And all of a sudden, it's like somebody gave another shot in the arm or so, okay, here we go. We got a second wind. Now we're really going to go nuts. But the funny thing was how, you know, there's 21 of them probably got into 16 Democrats. Yeah, every week, every week, they came out 21 to 16. You didn't even have to know, you just knew who's going to be that way. Yeah. And you want to say a thing is that he's probably going to be impeached. I don't want him to know. But no, no, no, but the point is being impeached is means they're going to have a trial in the Senate. But there isn't a Chinaman's chance that they're never going to pay off course. They're not going to convict him in the Senate. So what they're going to do is they're going to drag us through months and months and months and we'll have to hear testimony from the CBS people as Lucian Goldberg on the trip and fat Puggie Monica Lewin. What's we about? Who are there to say? There's nothing new. Another is, and the other thing is also, why does in the news seeing how a child's on? Why do they have to interview Jim Bush or even mentioned his name? There's no reason for that. The governor died. Why do they have to talk about the future governor? There's no need for that. Yeah, especially at a time when we're supposed to be a situation Jewish for the holiday. Exactly. All right, man. Thanks. Have a great day. What do you say? We have an open line at Broward one in the day five six seven maybe because it puts the lotion in the basket. You're every stuff and think about that. We just need to take that one that one line and stick that in here. I'll just put that for four hours. It puts the lotion in the basket. There you go. Or by the way, speaking of that. Oh, God, speaking of that. Talk about the timing. One moment please. Where's the A section? Where's the section A? Anthony Hopkins says, did you read this? That he will quit acting because he finds it very bad for one's mental health. Hopkins 60 said that after 35 years in the business, he finds it tiresome disturbing and deeply distasteful. I wanted to do something else with my life. He said adding that he explained all this to his wife and agent after winning an answer for the best actor 92% of the lambs. Hopkins summed up his career. I've done one or two good films and some bad films he said. It was a complete waste of time. But then he added, I'm very grateful to the business. They paid me well, but I've got enough money to look for the rest of my life. I like Los Angeles and I'm just going to drop out. He said, he said enough of the bull crap and he's going to go out there and just drop out and spend all of his money and have a good time. Nice going. Tony. You said one good thing about making all that money. It puts the lotion in the, uh, that's what he said. Here's a mobile and tamarack. Hello. I don't know. Great. What's up with this baseball deal? Can you believe it? I didn't ever get another nickel out of my pocket. Not me either, man. I won't I won't. Why anymore games? I don't care what the story is. I want no more part of it. It's out of my life. I lost interest back. You know, when this strike and everything and they started to get me back a little bit last year with all that crap with my wife. And of course, they're showing how stupid they are. They got a miracle last year with a sosa and a choir thing and all the renewed interest there and it's so they got a little bit of a kiss. They went back, you know, a lot of national publicity that they would never had otherwise and all of a sudden they shoot themselves in the feed again. These crazy owners would these outrageous unacceptable guy named salaries. Yep. And I won't even renew my, uh, majorly baseball package on my dish. I'm not going to, you know something. You just give me a good idea. I'm not going to do either. I can still put him on that side. I just don't work it. And you know, no, Clemens, you see Roger Clemens, they wanted to trade for him to, to Houston and he says if he goes there, he wants to be to high states. That means he's going to make more than bro. He's going to have to make 16 million here. It's unbelievable. And you know, well, that's that the way it is and hopefully baseball goes on. And I want to run on newspapers this weekend, by the way, speaking of Roger Clemens, said, they'll pack him a salami sandwich and get that lot of time who couldn't be fast enough for them. Absolutely. That's good. And now I'm going to go ahead and get your CDs there with my business. I'm not going to plug my business. I don't want any slippers that you got on your show. Oh, my god. I have every album. I'm hanging around my plate. So I'm going to do it up here. Thanks for the appreciate it. Take care. Thanks. Okay. We have an open line of Broward five. Just say, just say, the baseball. That's my message for 1990. And, okay, just say, it's a baseball. Tell more to stick it. Okay. All right. Want to overpaid pansies. They're going to hang the other sideline for a month. Okay. Wow. Gee. I got to hang it right. Hang this. Guys that are hitting 225. They're making four or five million here. They're not up there with the elite status yet. They're only making three or four or five million here. They hit 215. Guys that couldn't have made triple A ball stick. Couldn't have made the guy damn Rochester Redwing's 40 years ago. And they're supposedly major league ball players now because we got big league teams in Batavia and Lockport in Ronda Quote and Ishpaving Michigan and God damn Episolati. They're there. They're there. They're at Hooters on the corner of Pines and University in Pemberpine. San and Christian Dave and the Gantzamish Pohol. Okay. San and Dave. The water to deliver. I racked the crappy little country. Those like the mustache on the face. Just get rid of that. You're in drinking jubbing and blow up the whole goddamn plate. Chuck a ball stain to the motherfucker. Side a ball stain to the motherfucker. Side a ball stain to the motherfucker. Side a ball stain to the motherfucker. One 025 60 WQM the next next on 35 the Dow's down 65 points. The markets continues to do a I could talk about the corporate earnings and they can talk about this. But most of it has got to do with all this penis gay crap with this right wing. I'm going to take us something to win and we get to the which we will after Thursday and Friday. They'll pass at least one article in the house and move on to a trial on the Senate. And then you're going to see an economic in a market like you wouldn't believe not just here but all over the world. And you can thank those good old right wing Republicans who totally lost their mind. There's bubble right over there with that bearded de Yasir Airfart. Okay. What that's belly old Arab and they're uh high five and low high five and whatever they're doing. All over the goddamn world of stuff is going on and they're looking at us like are you people out of your mind? He lied about getting a blow job from some bimbo and you people are going to want to remove them from office. You crazy hypocritical sight them on your assholes who are busy breaking up people's marriages and screwing around behind sunny bono's back. See that you know that was the bad point. Remember when they when the first the then coats thing came out in the Henry I think they should have never stopped. They should have gone on with air be pieces sleeves about everyone those goddamn bastards and all of a sudden the would have stopped. In fact I wouldn't be the least but surprised. If part of the reason the new mice didn't just resign as speaker of the house were resigned to see all together. Because boy you talk about some real crappy sleeves they're waiting in the woodwork to come out on that they had they had him by the short hairs and the curly ones. Here's a mobile in tabranier hello. Good afternoon Neil. Yes sir. Before I ask for a shame was request I'd like to share a TV act on a head last night. I saw it's Jerry's poll well on the Haraldo show. Oh yeah what's that face to piece of crap on around for again huh? He made the motion. Yeah. He recommended that Clinton being a born again. Other and Baptist you should do the moral thing in resign. I mean the guy just unbelievable. That beside the point could I make a shame with the class? Yes sir. For my super plan. It isn't interesting by the way how they all start singing the same tune at the same time. First it was going to be impeachment then it was going to be censored. There was going to be impeachment and all of a sudden over the weekend they got on their bat lines together. Now he should do the right thing in step aside and spirits this lengthy impeachment trial in the Senate. Oh I don't even know we haven't seen fall over a while. We'll see him left him right now.

Here's a mobile in crawl spring. Hello. Yeah this vinyl bitch. First of all the reason why Sunny didn't even put together as well or find a will is because he caught her cheating with a cladian structure. Uh huh. He was going to be leaving the house because he tried making the relationship work. But they that he died that next weekend he was moving in with his mother because the marriage wasn't working. Found out that she was cheating with him and this was like the third guy that she was cheating with. Right. Now she's sitting on a panel listing ratings. Look at her looking around like a lost puppy dog like what tell them I'm doing here right. Right. She's got stuff in front of her that the guy behind her role for her. After that. She has no clue.

You got everyone there. Who's that dip they're dick and something. Yeah. Well I mean to sit there and say you know they were talking that you might resign this and that. There was no kind of there was the Chinaman chance let me say again the CNN pulled over the weekend brand new pull 62% of the American people said no when they actually resign 62% and you know as well as I do need a reluctant to get anywhere near 62% so millions and millions of people who never even voted for him either time he ran still think he's doing a hell of a job and cut the crap is what they're saying. And they're saying listen just admit to a purgory we're saying to you we're let it go. The second he admits the purgory they're going to string them up by his his own. Yeah.

Is that like something that's like reasonably local humor that somebody if I nailed it away, wouldn't you understand what was going on? Across the board, stuff that anybody else would enjoy. Across the board. All right. And then it's a Christmas present for like a homeless old guy. No, that would make it even better. Yeah, I agree. And let's go check, huh? Okay, have a great life pal.

I have a question for where to set up this other CDs. But if you have a summer here to Fort Myers for a couple hours. I mean, everybody wasn't sure if I raised over the bottom. I know I would. I don't know. I have a time to make it all the way down the borders and sunrise. Or all these other little places they set up and they chance of that. No, no. All you got to do is pick up the phone and make a call. Don't mail them. They're well been done. It's an idea. I mean, I got 954, 563, 3600, 954, 563, 3600. That's why they got to go to even have to leave your home. And they will look them out in the mail for you right away on the CDs too. Open line and Broward, 408, 5675, 60, Pomp 560 on the AT&T wireless line. Covered by and tell. Hello, Neil. Yes. I just want to ask you a couple of hockey questions. Why would the flyers trade Chris Grant and back over for a year? Because he stalked the joy out with and that's why because they just got Michael Rennberg back, who was a hell of a player in Chris Grant and has been a zero. They moved him from Shetter to left wing and the stalked joy out there. He just didn't adapt. I know Rennberg is a good player, but he ends in scoring much with him. Mahu and the hell woodscore with Tampa when you play it. See, the idea that guy doesn't do well on a crap team doesn't mean anything to me. I mean, nothing. Well, do you think they're going to move for Michael Rennberg? Will be much, much more positive for Philadelphia than Grant was. Do you think they're going to put him right up on the lead and do more? No, they are not. They already said they weren't. Why would they do that when he keeps Jones's plans of weight there? That's right. I would thought that maybe you're going to run a brand the more line. I thought maybe a year or two ago they would put the zubers up there on the right wing. Yeah. Because he's more of a younger, faster players than the lead. Why would you mess when you got a line like a clear and lindross and keep Jones? Why would you mess with that line? Well, I didn't probably do the best line in the league right now. I didn't realize the key to him just going to have that could of be yours. Well, he's doing great. Can I call a couple of people? People do spare? Yes, sir. Rarn Schultz, your poker-raising douchebag and John Roberts, your back-stabbing, two-faced Indian-giving-lying douchebag. Well, I'm doing that. Happy holidays. Okay. Thank you, sir. They're friendly. They're in a good Christmas Hanukkah mood, maybe. They're doing it. 560, 550, 560, 560, on the AT&T, wireless one. Even I'm starting to get into the corner and I'm getting punchy from these people. Here's a mobile in Pompano. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Good morning, you're good afternoon. How are you? Great. How was Toronto? Great. I was still there. Yeah, it's wonderful town. I was wondering, you probably didn't see it because you were away, but I missed the beginning of the show. I was wondering if anybody mentioned to you that there's two authors of that book. I believe it's called Frozen Con, but you talked about it. The two authors were on one of the talking chat shows I believe it was yesterday morning. They were all over the place. They were very, very interesting and really very aligned with the whole situation with the NFL. Did you talk to Don Yeager? Yeah, we go Friday. You called him. Yeah, I remember. Both of them are very articulate, very interesting interviews actually. And I think it was on the ABC show. I'm pretty sure. Anyway, it was just very interesting. I figured you probably didn't see it because you're away. But I will not go to a mollum game. I got tickets for the Toronto hockey game though. Toronto and our Pint is on go to that. I want support. I want support based on more. Amen. Okay. Just for you guys. No. To baseball, pal. That's our model for 99. And I've got all your CDs back to about 91 or 92. And God bless you. Awesome. That's a good holiday. And I'm happy. Okay. We have two open lines in Broward to a day. We're just kidding ourselves this last day. We should have signed off for one o'clock. I would have been a pretty decent Monday. But now it's really we're extracting. We're reaching in there. We're twisting where you're in. Because let's face it. Let's face it. You're going to have 20 hours today of national peace of people. Why? Because it often has got lost in other game last night. Because Jimmy has usual talks in the big games. I don't want to hear about Dallas. You know, Dallas was 100 years ago. A lot of a lot of a hair about the criminals in the hurricane. And I was a million years ago. This is now. That was then. This is now. 560 50 50 50 60 out of 18 T wireless line. Too bad we don't have 40 hours in a day. Then we could have 36 hours today of people calling you and going. Man. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello. Thank you. All right. Great. Yeah. I thought I combined your two favorite subjects. And so one you get a kick out of it. I'll really just insignificance and hockey. While it goes and Boston, I saw a number of stickers that Jesus saved. You know, what's the next on after there? Oh, and then this is so old. It's so old. I'm seeing it. Okay. I said, I just did remember. Okay. Thank you. Okay. Open line and Broward to a day. Please don't please don't reach way back into the stone age for your material. If you got something for us great. If not, hit back. Take a good very amen. And relax. 125 but 560 WQN. Where do you find Joe Rose just to find and see Colescee? The first team. Right where you got it. Sports radio 560 QAF. Why a lot of people have little boy? Someone hoping a through window. Because somebody just cut the cheese. The around my is a falling. And make this a coat and bring me. You know I only have a very small of stress. There's three at one of them all. And there's no chance I'd last that time of gas. That's a conscience and so strong. Is that what you're thinking? You're all wrong. It wasn't deep, babe. I'm down down down down and warm the sea. It wasn't deep, no just one. Go, babe. Traveling in flames to the rest room. As a trick goes down my legs. You can play me if you want to. But I only have to go in there. What you say is true and I don't know what it's true. It's true, bro. We go. While I've gone. But someone else is blowing up out the cell. The leader's long after I've gone. And every time I'm gone, I've got to go wrong. It wasn't deep, babe. I'm down down down and warm the sea. It wasn't deep, no just one. Go, babe. It wasn't deep, no just one. Go, babe. I don't know, no just one. It wasn't deep, babe. It wasn't deep, no just one. You didn't know why I played that. You didn't know why I played that. Did I have to push out the back? Should I hit the book of Brian Gaacan? Yeah. Well, I played it for two reasons. Number one because we're doing the Murray Bono was a mindless hypocritical put which he is. And number two because every time I play a book of Brian bit that guy, a call. Well, you know, a book of Brian, you know, somehow resisted his advances. He kept his honor. And this guy, every time we play a book of Brian, but he's called up, Hawkins or your child. A book of Brian, so, but I mean, but yeah, get a life spell. Get a new boyfriend. Here's a mobile in Evan, sure. Hello. I'll go near. Yes, sir. I'd like to know where it almost is. So called holiday spirit is. I don't know if he's an outdoing any shopping. No, I don't have to leave yourself. But I was not doing my little holiday shopping. And every store that I've been in, it seems, is it on bilerate salespeople? Yeah. Not one of them even responds like when you're done with you, ringing you up, taking your money. Not one of them say happy holidays, anything like that to you. Yeah. Like they're bugging you. Well, it's like they want to be consistent like they are the rest of the year right. Here's a mobile in Hollywood, hello. Hey, Dio. Yes, sir. You're the best. Listen, I don't know why my people come here from the York. I know why I came here from the North because I really like you. You're a lot better. And I guess as much as you complain and I complain to about the area, the reason that we're here is because we like you better. We do. Well, I mean, we like you better than the alternative relative to go back, you know. If we didn't like it, we probably wouldn't be here. If you don't know all the pens on what you're talking about, I mean, if you like the weather better than freezing your ass off, I think most sane people like the weather better, at least part to the year than freezing the rest off in terms of almost anything else. I would disagree with you. Sir, I don't know. I don't. I'm here because I make a very good living here. And I've invested about a hundred years in my life here. And then that's it. That's why I'm here. This, this is a vast wasteland. This is a, this is a nothing. This is a zero. This is a place where, you know, I have to laugh. I'm looking at this article about the sports stadiums in the arena is another plane of probably empty crowd because there's so much to do here. I mean, yeah, if you're idea of life is playing tennis and golf and the snorkeling, I guess there's a lot to do here. Well, me, I'm from Midnish, again. I'm, you know, I don't take that much to impress me, maybe. Yeah. But I'm here because I mean, I kind of dig it. I like it. Well, good. And my, there's a lot of people for people that have so much disrespect for the area that they continually, uh, they on purpose, lamb the teams when they go to the stadium and they sort of are in your faith about where they're from. As far as I'm concerned, they're just coward. Well, what do you mean, I slammed, you're starting like a Joe's brother and law. Well, what does that mean? I mean, if you're a family, if you're a family, if you're a family, if you're a family, if you're a fan of a team, what does that have to do with where you live? That's the only permanent thing about a team, buddy. So, in other words, if you're a buffalo fan, you have to live in buffalo the rest of your life? No, but you have to have some kind of, I would think that a person would have some kind of a geographic connection. I don't get me wrong. If you live in buffalo for 40 years and you retired and came down here, why would you be a Miami fan in any sport? If you lived in Cleveland for 100 years and you had to thoroughly be a, I wouldn't necessarily be a Miami fan, but I wouldn't be at a mattress in your face. I hate you. I like where I'm from. Well, the guy's talking about obnoxious New Yorkers, okay, and the most of them came here. So, that's, that's probably true, but, you know, the point isn't expensive. What is it about? What is it about? I think it's true that New Yorkers are a massive a lot of times. And I think the reason is, because, okay, we're looking to call up one of the more children talking about the jet skiing. Okay, we have an open line in Broward, five six seven, say this to me, I can't deal with it. If you like a sports team, or you don't like a sports team, that's fine. Is it really that important? No. First not. I mean, if you're going to use it as an excuse to hate somebody else, whether it's rock religion or because their color of their skin is a little bit too shades a little too dark or too light or whatever it is, fine, and you got a problem. One more good reason to be pissed off of other people, but Jesus, this thing with the jet, and this station, by the way, is partly responsible for that idiotic mentality. The jet's in the dolphin thing and the heat and the next thing. I mean, you know, it gets so fond of us in boring after a while. And the bottom line is they played a football game last night again. They played their second game of the season and the jet's beat him again for the second time and the final score was really not indicative of the game from everything I read in here. And they won the game and that's it. And life goes on. Here's North Miami. Hello. Okay. I think these panels are over the hanging out with these, west coast teams. Do I think what? You think they'll be able to play with these west coast teams in their conference? The weather's the west coast team in their conference. Who are the west coast team in our conference? Sir. Sir. Speak to me. My dumb Julio friend, my little mechanic, yeah, right. Will they be able to play with the west coast team in their conference, which is the eastern conference, which there are no west coast. There's the west coast, the Florida team. Which thank God we don't have that one the lightweights, but there are no west coast teams in eastern conference. Last time I looked at the standing last time I checked my map. Another hockey expert. There you go. All right. Here's Tamara. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. Neil God. I got something to share with you about the president. I have a friend in town, Haxi, where I went to school to tell me. You got to work for the Republican Committee. He's a whole bill. I said, these people are machiginists. You didn't know what I meant. They're fascist, maniacists. You know that? These are the same people that asked to everyone on the, the bell region, something, Kyle Haxi. All right. They asked to everyone. They want to throw this guy out. They want to throw him out for nothing. It's disgusting. It's the fall of America. It's the fall of an empire to watch these people work. They got evil in their eyes. They got poison in their eyes. If you watch them. Another thing, Neil. Yeah. Eight years ago. But those are the lotion in the basket. You put the lotion in the basket. Eight years ago. The grocery store may find Delhi on sunrise board of art in between Pine Island and University. We should send you cannishes over it. We should send you to the next station. Remember sure. Remember crazy Melda Kanishm? Mm-hmm. Melda now got Duban insurance agency in Tamarack. Instead of Kanishm, you sell insurance. Yeah. We should get a little plug in there. Okay. Happy to look up. Thank you. Good on you. That's the reason you call. He don't care about the border regions. He don't care about the penis gate. Monica gates. Any of that. He cares about getting in the plug because what the hell is Jewish? It's wrong with that. Twenty three, four, two, five, sixty, WCYM. Where did you find that? Half-lip. Right where you got it.

Real bad news. They're dying over there. That's what Sam said. They're dying over there at the. Well, you know, if they go to places instead of trying to get laid, if they go to places like, you know, you're shopping mall stuff like that. But these guys want to get laid. They want to pick up some chicks out there, which is their prerogative. How about doing that after two o'clock would be good. Instead of going out there to hudders at pines in university, you think that there'd be a busy location with it. It's a very busy intersection. In Pembro Pines shouldn't that be our audience there? And that'd be millions of our people there. And they got under 100 bucks there. So we got still under $600 for the whole day. And we're going to make a thousand bucks for the day every day. I'm going to use a QAM van things. Even if they have to stay there until 1, 2, 3 in the morning. 4, 5 in the morning. Even if they have to be there when we come back to Marmorning at 10 o'clock and start all over again. But God damn are you people slow out there in Pembro Pines. What is the story with that? I guess what we're discovering is that we have pockets of listeners. You know what I'm saying? We have little pockets in plantation. We have little pockets down there. We're going to the other day that we had a little bit of response on US-1. The growth. Oh, and the growth. Yeah, we got some closet people in the growth. But you have to be just in the right place when the right neighborhood with it about two or three blocks. And we're all these people are. Otherwise we hit these big gigantic gaps. Here's a mobile implantation. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Two, just a couple words about what's going on in Washington. First of all, Tom Delay. The Budman. Yeah. Yeah, the Budman from Texas. A very interesting thing happened in 1992 when Mr. Chief Justice Rennquist changed the procedure for selecting the three judge panel that picked the inventor counsel. Very briefly, these guys used to be retirees from both parties who had no particular axe to grind. And along came Iran contragade and then the white water, the initial white water independent council wasn't doing much. And so in 1992, the head of the three judge panel was replaced by a former Reagan right wing zealots who in turn appointed Mr. Storm. And yes, who's going to be presiding in the Senate. Mr. Rennquist. Oh yeah, that's right, of course. So, you know, and everybody seems to sort of like be preoccupied with Christmas shopping while the entire constitution has turned upside down. I mean, there's no defending this guy, but. I mean, some of the stuff that they were talking about, which nobody is paying any attention or listening to, some of the stuff that they were bringing up in the impeachment articles about how he lied. About how he lied to his cabinet members, how in God that he lied to them about whether he was having sex with this woman, not about anything the head to do with government. He lied to fuck the fuck the cat to so what? And the buddy. Well, yeah, but anyway, the, I don't know. Yeah, what is really take right wing coup to what do you mean, what are you going to take? They're already doing it. They're in the process. I hate to break the news to you. They're in the process. Well, ready underway. What's, uh, hope, uh, a text of turn for the better. Okay, and have a great thing. Two open lines a day to and broader. The public that I interested in this, they want to know a little bit more about Joe to Matthew. Did he have a good, the end today. How are things going with Jol and Joe? And they want to go out there and do their shopping and light the candles on the menorah and go out and get to the light bulbs on a Hanukkah bush. And then that's it. 560, 505, 50, 560 on the AT&T wireless one. I can't believe we're dying in pepper pines. Just coming this morning, we got beautiful totals over 85 grand with still seven of the eight borders towards the report in. We got the outline precincts going to be reporting into tomorrow. When's the day? We could be up there close to 90 grand already. And this thing worked miraculously on Thursday with a QAM van. It worked great on Friday over a thousand bucks each day. And we got a real big smile on our post. We'll have to miss it. We're going to get the big number and we go out today. And there you go. Excuse us for infringing on your time. Okay. Excuse us, especially there in pepper pines. Here's a mobile in Bokeh. Hello. Hi Neil, how are you? Okay, sir. I have an opportunity to go out to the newer reader to watch the Panthers play. Yeah. I found out that the big problem out there. The fight from no enthusiasm on the ice is no enthusiasm in the stand. Yeah. And what's the story? You go to Maple Leaf Garden or the storm? Sure. There isn't Maple Leaf Gardens. It's not the forum. It's not Madison Square Garden. There are 17, 18,000 people in there. And maybe maybe 10 or 20 percent of them really are there because they care about the team because they understand the game. And the rest of them are there for whatever we do have to ask them because it's something to do somewhere to go. Somebody gave them the tickets. That's why they're there. Right. It's just a total event. This is not a hockey town, so these people don't know from hockey. When do you think it's ever going to become a hockey town considering you have half these people from much more come down here and New York has come down here to watch the game. But there's still no electricity in the stands. Everyone sits on their hands. Yeah. You think it's a little late? Well, maybe if they put some more t-shirts on the crowd, we'll get them out of here. Let's start doing that while the game is going on. I think this guy just gave us a real good idea. In fact, the Panther Patrol are there on skate, they can skate pretty quick. While the action is out of one of the ice, they can be down the other hand. You know, it's looking at the shirts off of the crowd. And everybody's screaming in the yelling and they're watching themselves up on a big scoreboard up there. I mean, it won't anything to the team or to scoring any goals. But it'll add some more excitement in the atmosphere of this guy. Well, you can't manufacture it. You cannot manufacture enthusiasm. You can manufacture fake enthusiasm, which I've been talking about for the last couple of years now. That kind of crap. And everybody, you can enjoy it and watch themselves up on the screen. But when you got about 70, 80% of the people in there who don't even understand what's going on out there, like this guy before who calls and asks me about what are we going to be able to beat the teams in the, the Western teams in our conference. I assume meaning that we lost a calorie of the night. God. And when you got guys like Michael Russo who's just a fat, like I said at the beginning of the show, just a big road toned, schmuck who's nothing more than the propaganda. He's the propaganda voice for the organization. Giving us a song at an answer about stew barns and how he's done the fourth line with Pittsburgh. And they're disgruntled and they'd like to cut a salary because they're almost bankrupt. And they had about $20 million to make the payroll and the audio audio audio audio audio. And to me, time he just scores his 13th goal on Saturday and a fourth, repengalment over St. Louis. Does anybody on the Panthers after? He's already struck. He's got 14. Anybody got 14. Anybody got 12? Anybody got 11? Oh. And Michael Russo has usual writing whatever it is that they want him to write. Whatever will carry favor with the organization. You're just a suck hole. Mike, why don't you face it, okay? You and that dark, complexed, front of you, over there at the Harold, that writes the same article like you write every day, and you're going to put it in the paper, whatever it is that they tell you that to put in. What a joke. You pick up the Toronto son of the Toronto star, right? Or a real newspaper in a real sports town. And you read columns where people have got something to say. Not just where people are parenting, whatever the organization tells them to put in there. But hey, it works easy here because most of the people don't know what they're talking about anyway. Still who? All right, we're not going to stew over anymore. Chris, while it looks real, get up there in the stand, and that's who.
