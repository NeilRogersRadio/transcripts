Gene Autry and righty McDonald in the same weekend Wow pretty heavy duty heavy duty stuff So anyway I don't want to talk football because I don't talk football in the show But I do want to say this I get in the car I was so most of the dolphin game yesterday Boy talk about us news inducing event Good God And that asshole like called on Friday was give me a song to dance about how there's more physical Football is more physical and hockey Those two or three assholes include him in the New York Slob who yeah you're a schmuck You know I'm watching that stuff yesterday and you're screaming at the set Let's play already and they stand around in a referee and all before he blows it He's a dick at around in the screw and around blow the whistle Get in the guy damn huddle call a play get up to the line of scribbage and let's play some football already Let's have some action Oh no they're dittlet around it dittlet around it dittlet around Jesus Joseph and Sarah But at any rate so I see that embarrassing a humiliating performance One of the worst I have ever seen in my life by a dolphin team I mean unquestionably by any standard I get in the car to go to the store and I'm listening to these idiots calling up Kimba Boa camper and they're whining about the officiating and about this and about that you know something I'm going to tell you something It's a lost cause so long and maybe it's in every town But in this town trying to talk to I mean these dolphins if there are really such people If they really understand the sport that was a pathetic performance yesterday by the team by the coaching staff Good, golly all the blind men could have done a better job coaching the team yesterday Did this guy? I heard that jet fan called a worst team. I'm coming to work this morning Got a great chuck a lot of that have a couple more donuts you may go What do you call him a bowling bowl with arms something like that? Oh, I loved it. I mean just pathetic. Okay, so it is only one game. I grant you that but why can't you be honest? Why is it the so called fans in a town always have to have an excuse? They have to blue sky. They have to do all the stuff to blue crap I don't know maybe because they just don't know what they're talking about that could be it couldn't that be it Oh, my just be so the house judiciary hearings are going on right now. The house judiciary committees having their hands There's built McCollum from Florida. Oh, geez. God pot him up for about one second Or that's a more sure too much Yeah, about half a word too much in there better watch it mister So we had our big appearance at the agalaria is a girl going to call us this morning some time Or we're going to because this thing is starting a very disorganized and slowly if you know what I mean our center one campaign this year Which t-shirt Tom over capture glory made some great t-shirts the best everybody with us here They're black and they have under front the cover of one of our CDs and on the back they got the cover of the other CD In full color and multicolor and really sharp. I mean these are great. What do we sell six of these on a Saturday maybe seven maybe seven You know tomorrow night at the pizza lot that thing is going to determine for us. I realized that the I got to tell you the gallery was very nice to us So I mean the borders people over by the gallery But that particular location and you know we had four people drive over all the way from Fort Myers on Saturday All the way from Fort Myers They drove over to come and pick up the best of CDs and say hi to me and get one of those stupid picture cards with a lot of graph and by whatever else they did and make their donations to center one Poor people all the way from Fort Myers in the local area dating Broward not too much Maybe they couldn't find it. Maybe they were like fat Joe from a whammy maybe they're over to plantation borders looking around But if you live out in West Broward or anywhere west of anywhere it's so awfully tough to get over there because somebody's Boulevard is a nightmare Jesus, what are they going to get that done sometime in our lifetime? Oh man From where I live out there in plantation took me 45 freaking minutes to get there because of the construction because you nerds up there on a weekend can't drive a lick you couldn't drive it if you're like dependent on it So it was a pretty Paul tree turnout did we get a number did Carol just call you or what and the number is yes We'll note in an hour about what they did downstairs but 1,110 upstairs. Oh, we already knew that Or that that's on old merchandise and the t-shirt said has nothing to do with the new CDs and stuff But why thought we're what about the total for all the stores are we going to begin that every Monday? Is this going to be kind of a half as the operation this year because that's the feeling I get what half as operation I mean what kind of a deal is that How do we have any idea of how much progress we're making how much we have to prod the natives out there What do we have to do with this thing to raise any money you can't do that just sitting back and waiting for a number to fall out of the sky Like the duck on the groucho mark show fall and down with that The stormy first it off sign on its ass on its beak So I don't know maybe you know and of course I had forgotten two years ago When we did the one borders all carried the stuff and stock it all of their stores our live appearances actually It were of diminishing importance because I mean who the hell needs to see me and George in us assholes you know When you can go into borders any day of the week at your convenience and pick up the best of CDs and cassettes and what have you That's a point they had the drop to automatically I remember the old days when we started doing this and we go to whatever store might have been and we do $7.89,000 on a Saturday was great But in the meantime if you didn't chew up on that day those really opportunities and we raised only your fraction of those days for charity What we are right now we hope So while the border stores in Dayton Broward have got our best of CDs for 97 and 98 they're great if we say so ourselves And if you want those or the attesures which are sensational which I sure be proud to wear if I could sew two of them together Huh, it will be at the appease a lot six day to clock tomorrow night 35 14 South University drive you don't even have to buy a buy a meal I have to buy anything All you gotta do is be alive because they set up the table out in front there and if you just want to well, you know make your donation and get the merchandise You don't even have to come in and see us because then Jeff will try to you know stir you over to table and make you sit down and buy dinner If you do that we hope you will do that but nevertheless it's your choice And I do want to say this the guy with the eye showed up there and Saturday he was on his best behavior I was gone can he said that from you from your own kipper. He had torn for his sins And no he did say that no he's taken a turn for the best He was on his very good behavior and he was okay and Gilbert was there and he was saying I take me after the end is usual as only Gilbert could do acting like a real jerk And fat show our camera guy from whammy cuz Ron was there from our whammy crew and our go waiting dying days on a whammy show In fact, Joe while we were waiting and waiting if they could boy now the Gilbert's put on this incredible act wouldn't be great to have a fact Joe here with that camera Put this on the TV show so we can sprite suppose to suppose it up a little bit Well, fat Joe was over at the borders in plantation is where he was And by the time he got around to figuring out what they it was and calling it one 15 by the time he would have gotten from there to where we were we'd all been leaving anyway, so we didn't get any of that So like I said in starting tonight by the way, they show on whammy on channel 69 is a 10 30 only but it will be from today It'll actually be like on the same day that you you know that you heard the radio shows that gonna make a difference oh first not But I'm just telling you that just in case case you want to see these beautiful t-shirts from Tom over captured glory the New Rogers T-shirts which I know most of you are to here's you know two uptight to walk out in public and where That you can just walk around in the house Wham around the house and then have like a little bell on it so that if you're gonna go outside the belva or better take this off before I go outside It's 1009 at 560 wq8 I will not give it to you So the house judiciary committee hearings are going on right now. I'm sure that many people are sitting there just glued to their sets watching this crap What you're here's that representative George geek took a pencil by the killer Who's a pontificating you know John Coniors for president. That's what I say There's a guy who's brilliant he's a genius too smart for most of you folks But at any rate, it's interesting how the media continues playing this crap. This is one of the saddest chapters in the history of the human race and especially of this country A country that's like a very very fond of a petting itself on a back and running around and talking about how great we are and how much better we are in everybody else And yati yati yati in the set of the fact that we have a crappy education system and most of our people are functionally illiterate and our health or care system sucks to be side Though don't confuse us with the facts and at the time when the world markets are going in a crapper and they're killing each other when you're slavia and all over the goddamn world and satama's just a few months away from make a nuclear weapons. We're right doing this And the world will live hopefully to one day just absolutely universally condemn this country for the procedure that's going on right now And to show you the way they fair-minded way the media are conducting this so-called public investigation buried on page nine a in the Sun not on the front page But buried on page nine a in the Sun sent alas morning grand jurors curious about trips notice And it goes on to talk about how the grand jury grilled this bitch and found out that over a year before all of this star gotten involved in this so-called monica gate investigation She was opening up a loose lip And talking about all this stuff with the attorneys for a follow-johns and the Kenster also was involved at that time and it says if trip as she may taint nearly wanted the tapes to protect her against the purgory charge If she were ever forced to testify in the Jones case about the win ski and was not interested in the book deal What was so thrilling about these passages that you're wondering that she was talking with the Lucian Goldberg about for example the two occasionally wise cracking excitedly discussed revelations from the win ski about Clinton's penis size How do you like that? So evidently just like Rick weaver was say he might have been penis eyes. Oh, we don't have that in here, damn it. Well, that have been great if we would have had that but we know crap So there you go. That's on page nine a by the way if anybody out there wants to read this you have to have to dig way into the front sections and maybe your back sections and newspapers dig into the articles about what's really going on here Because unfortunately the media for whatever reason they're like go well, and because they make it a lot of money off of all is one of the reasons for fun and profit and That's the new natural disgrace Okay, on a much brighter side Am I gonna give away my tickets to the panther retemp of a opening game this Friday at the beautiful macaroon along with that club parking pass? No, yes, I am. I guess it I got him right here. I'm not gonna be here. I don't want to empty seats in section 101 there and you probe bastards that sit like a regular seats inside not on the ends on the aisles Yeah, your seats are a little bit narrower in the new arena. You don't want to bad because I'm on the aisle Nan, nan, nan, nan, there you go I'm on the aisle so I can kind of like spread out a little bit with my big fat ass and my legs over to the other. I don't have to worry about like being pinched in real tight And those little narrow seats because we need to make the extra money so what we'll do today is that we'll take names Any the colors between now and like 145 And then these are definitely for pickup by the way. I'm not taking a chance and you mailing these out because it's already Monday and the game is Friday night So they'll have to pick these up along with a parking pass for Friday Anybody who would like to be right just to take your name and address will do a drawing at about 145 for the a panther tickets my own in my own goddamn seats You'll be able to stick your ass this Friday night panthers in Tampa Bay not the world's greatest opponent, but nevertheless that's what we got Here's a lady mobile in Miami, hello Hi, I was wondering when the NHL waiver dropped in the NHL waiver draft is today.

I don't I don't think of the teams are going to follow Yeah, but the teams that have already done it like the pirates Wow, they are getting what? What? Go ahead. Now people aren't going to do something because Wayne did it they're going to see the whole thing It's not just the Marlins the whole thing has to do with professional sports I just watched this series on CDC about the National hockey league and the agents and the players and all agreed that's going on and the fact that a lot of these small markets teams like Edmonton uh Winnipeg already went out Quebec already went out and then you just can't make it It's been the fans out there continue supporting the idea that these guys are worth eight and ten and 12 and 15 and $20 million a year for the hell is the money going to come from and then the fans turn around start pitching Well, gee, we don't want to spend 80 hundred bucks to go to see a game.

Um, couple things yesterday the game was awfully boring. I actually went to public forget third quarter to bite dinner I mean they had no offense none zero zippity doodda they couldn't do anything with that ball and Then late in the game they could get that one lucky drive which happens at almost every game It seemed that has done nothing all game the other team goes in that prevent defense to kind of layback and they went down It's called one touchdown like that's the claim to fame if you take that out of this statistics It was a humiliation and these people don't want to deal with that Well, that was one of my choices it was the referees, you know, and that was one of my points I went to the store Fontaine are came back and I really didn't miss anything Also on Friday didn't get a chance to call in but I went to the third thing I came last week in the new arena right Living camera Let's get ten after seven Got there by the drop of the pop team where the traffic where the construction is Had some real deep in club seats tonight Nighted leathery back.

They were that great, but they're often stuff At listening to all the dolphins fans both about how they're gonna kick our butt this weekend I'm just glad I can finally brush that off instead. I can get to listen to him pitch in my own yeah In the belly it can win and make excuses about how the official stole the game from them is if they had any offense It was the officials were the officials out there playing defense for the jets. I don't think so Now I think they're a bad call them both sides of the ball Right regardless, you know, a game is a game don't take it so seriously, but don't always talk down about everybody It's really rude. Yeah, but that's typical of the dolphin fans all talk a big game They would you know they they win two or three games this goes on every year it happens every single season They win the first two or three games then they start talking trash they start talking Super Bowl and then they start coming back to worth Have you realized that they basically meet nobody anyway? Well, I went to the game last year. I'll never go to the dolphin games. They're absolutely more on they get drunk out of their mind They don't know what to do in the fight the Jerry fans don't do that anyway before I go I wouldn't I wouldn't request if I could you please play cowboy dick. Okay, and can I get on the lift? Okay, hold on You know, thank god that they are jet fans don't do that.

AL O's jz J. E. Those slabs slabs a man closely identified with the pronazi puppet regime in Croatia that murdered hundreds of thousands of Serbs and Jews how do you like that in the Catholic church be outification is the first step towards St. Hood The Pope has described steppinac as the bull work of the church among the quotes who resisted the yoke of communism in the name of human rights and Christian dignity After World War II steppinac a archbishop of Zagreb became an internationally known as a vehement opponent of Tito's communist regime in Yugoslavia which in 1946 put upon trial and convicted him of treason in collaboration He spent five years in prison and the rest of his life under house arrest in the small village of Krasak is birthplace in died in 1960 Much beloved by Catholic quotes for his simple piety he also became an enduring symbol of Croatian nationalism That was revived during the violent break of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s But it is steppinac's record during the Nazi era that troubles Jewish organizations and the orthodox church Historian say steppinac openly celebrated the pro Nazi Yugoslavia regime that came to power in Croatian 1941 and made little protest while Yugoslavia murdered through the 30,000 Jews and perhaps 350,000 Serbs with a ferocity that startled even the Nazis Even the Nazis were saying oh my god Jesus In Croatia you could draw a straight line between the behavior of the government and the influence of the church Said rabbi Abraham Cooper assistant dean of Simon Vizenthal Center in Los Angeles and organization that documents the activities of Nazi work criminals and their collaborators So once again the churches celebrating and they're gonna make a mistake sooner later probably sooner because they never met a Nazi They didn't like We have an open line in date 5670560 pound five 60 on the AT&T line Here's for a lot of deal.

A kick miller was claimed by Pittsburgh. From the New York Island. So far, there's not one player other than the first one, which I forget the least, the original defense of the nigga. There's not one other player you've mentioned to anybody ever heard of. And if I never heard him, how though, what's the chance the audience ever heard of? Listen, if I didn't call you back, was it a can't win? You're a little so what about the Panthers? No player was claimed and they didn't claim anybody. Oh, but you know what? Oh, my god. Oh, my god. The players that were exposed in this draft really have no significance. What are you talking about? Mothers make it almost $2 million a year. They got to get rid of them. Now they want to get rid of Terry Carcner in the Jeff Norton. So Ben that it hurts. They'd like to put them all three on a great-home bus. And you know that. Now the situation is this. Well, respond. No, no. I'm telling you what's going to happen now. Am I right? Why did I unload those three guys and their salaries? Absolutely. But now the trading deadline or embargo has been lifted. And you're going to see a plurvy activity including the working. You're going to see a plurvy activity. I thought he was in a back seat when children Kennedy was getting it. That's what they say. That's the thing. That's not what happened. And nothing happened. And children Kennedy, by the way, had a little bit of a problem here. Yeah. A couple of weeks ago. He fell off the wagon. Yeah. A little drinking and drug problem. It always comes back to that same excuse again. He was in a hummer. Yeah, I bet with Graham James. He was in a hummer with Graham James. Okay, remember I think you reached the end of the line on that one. See, I hate the least they're making a trade. They stopped. Yeah, who are they trained besides being a five fan? Here's the dealer. Two rumored deals. Yeah. One of them has a three way deal with the New York Times. Kennedy was in a hummer. That was almost redeem your other call. Not quite, but all those. John, it's true. Yeah, but it is. That's what Graham James said. Oh, that's what happened at Evanson. Yeah. But anyway, I then could end up in Vancouver with Tabell Buray ending up with a New York Islanders and travel. And travel into what end up in Toronto. Another scenario has a Buray possibly ending up in Toronto. But time remains. The New York Islanders are having a fire sale. They've got so many players now that they're trying to unload to get their salary down. There's an event of a place to play in. So they're going to be playing a shini hockey out there in a pond, I think. But expect quite a bit of activity between now and Friday, certainly. Great. But, okay. Thanks so much, Rimmer. All right. Okay. Watch out for that hummer. Oh, thank God. That's over. We have an open line in date. Why, I just lit the end of this cigar. I think I lit the tip of my nose to it the same time. Smells like burning chicken. Oh, God. I'm serious. I just lit the end of my goddamn lit the tip. Open line in date. 5, 6, 7, if I told you I'd commit suicide if he called again. 21 till 1 and 5, 60 WQA. That'd be pressed. Now, bulk up Ryan, who is the epitome of walking depression walks in the door. And he's crying for money. What was the first thing I did when I saw him in there? I reached in my wallet tonight and pulled it out and a check too. And he came in here and he gave it, but I beat, but I beat. But if I kept this man alive for how long now, have I kept him alive? Off the streets, out of a dumpster, off a welfare. Huh? And if you could adjust her to come in, I can't keep track. Okay, it was gone for a week on vacation. Does he get paid to remember me? No, but he wasn't here last week. He was back. So last week, this week. Okay. I had a slip of the mind, okay, because I'll decide out of mine. An additional which he's already tripled to think anyway. And I want the quadrupled dip when you're paying him on a goddamn TV stuff. Here's a guy that gets paid four times to do the same stuff. Which I have no problem paying him what he's got coming with a little deal we made on the side to keep him alive. But he stood here in the doorway holding the goddamn stupid and the metamy, metamy, metamayman. Oh my god. Why didn't you call me this morning? We were early and say, just stay home, don't come in today. Why didn't you do that? I thought you knew it was Monday. Why didn't you warm it? It's kind of nothing to do with Monday. He's just as depressing on Tuesday. He's not any better run Tuesday. Are we not on Thursday? No, Wednesday. Friday? No. He's telling me about it. What's this guy's name? Georgey Shabbos. That's got drafted. This guy's making it up as he goes along. Man, you think that a guy that works with the dumb frog would at least the little we're rub off. At least he'd be able to shop both. He's got, he wears a beautiful shot. Poss. His hat. God. We have an open line in day. I guess it goes to show you when you work with the dumb frog. It does rub off. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60 and pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Here's Carl Gable. So, Carl Gable's going once. Yes, sir. Yeah. I had a question in the statement.

If the president can only be reelected or elected twice. If he doesn't serve as second one, isn't he? Can we reelect them again? Could he run again? Yeah. Good answer.

Here's a mobile and pepper pine, hello. I knew. Yes, sir. How you doing? I thought that joke that I made in reference to Zelda and Kennedy in the homero was pretty good. It was about material he had. Yeah, I think he slept into it though. I think it was an accident. He just got a curl into it. Yeah, he answered my question. I was going to ask you about the potman. I just had a quick question about the panthers are playing. He's a huge Toronto fan, but for the glass at the, at the, at the on the call and say hello and you have a great show. Thanks one and two in the exhibition season sir. There's one and two for those leaves. They got to go. You know, hey, maybe I'll call back and now we'll go up and see them in the cup. All right. All right. Let's see. Hold your breath. Okay. We have an open line and Broward all a day. Crap out again, man. Every time you think you got a little bit of a moment of a day. County all of a sudden it turns clear. That's right. We got three lines there in day. We got one for Kendall. We got one for Coconut Grove. We got one for girl Gables. One for Hylia. One for South Miami. One for Cutlerade. One for Homestead. One for Sweetwater. Three. And they're all dead as a door nail. Five, six, seven, oh, five, 60. We're just not speaking a right language on here. That's all. I guarantee if that whammy thing which by the way that's going off at a month at TV. Thing, no matter what these people try to tell you about it coming back because it won't. And you know the other thing that astonished me how they BS us. Maybe you try to make us feel better. All the other local shows went off. They only showed that went off was out loud. That generation any a that thing is on all over the guy in place. An ocean drive and city desk and sports town. The other local shows didn't go off. This is the show. The show that they used over there like a play toy. Well, now that we got those football shows on Sunday night, we don't need to put him on anymore. We used to have a month for an hour. He had like filler. This was just filler for them over there. That's all. Until I hit some paint crap like that Bobby Bowdoin show, or those other football shows where the video is like we all distorted. And you can barely see any other girl. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no. I mean, you talk about sloth. They make the bees these look like uptown and downtown man. They make them look like big time. So thanks a lot to Marvin Romain for getting us involved with this mess. Here's Weston. Hello. How are you doing? Okay, sir. And these are hard acts of follow. I got the Rimmer. I got the guy acting you a question and I got a frog. Three in a row. They stunk. Listen, this one I'll let you know. I went to the to see the Queen of Rock yesterday night. Yeah. And it was a great concert. And we've gone Georgia said, whew, what do you get with it? He is so slow, man. He said he's in a coma there. So how was the how was the acoustics? I loved it. The sound was really good. And I was trying to get some blood off my nose. But the seeds are small, but you know what? You get what you pay for. And the bottom line is I had a great view. Even though, you know, I was up in the up in the section 4 or 11. No, it was brilliant. But you know what? I mean, those are the only tickets I could get. And I was there. So, but let me tell you, I love that place. For just place, very clean. Now how many people they hold for a concert in there? 40,000? 20,000. 20,000. I think you're going to help 15. Right. But man, the skyboss is beautiful. I mean, that's where the money is for these people. So, but anyways, the concert was great. You know, he, he said, I mean, I, you know, I listened to him. So the kid. So, you know, to me, he's, he's it. And had a great time. Took the wife and, you know, had some food there. It was, in fact, so I think it had a good time, bro. We have an open line of date to a broadward. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, pound 5, 60 on a mobile one line. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. I got a great story for you. Okay. Saturday afternoon, I'm in the Sky Lake area going for my haircut, which I do every week. And I have an hour to kill because he can't seem until five o'clock. So, there's a very, very good piece of place right around the Sky Lake area. And I've been going to three years. And I went in and as I'm driving in there, I saw a guarantee that I'm not going to have any slices ready to take out. So, I'm driving in there and I get in there and I go, without even looking over at the slice rack, I said, I'd like two slices and two diaclokes to go. So, she goes over and looks at no slices right now. I said, I want to see the manager right now. She gets the manager over. And I said, I cannot understand one thing here. This is a key to place. Why on earth are you telling me you have no slices to go right now? Well, the guy said it'll take, I don't want to go. One, two, one, 15 minutes. Well, to put a new stage right, even a slice pie in the oven cooking. I said, I wanted a one. Any business there was there anybody standing around? Yeah, it's these people over there. I wanted to see four three. Oh. I said, I want to know why every time I come in here in the last four or five times. Right. There are no slices to be picked. Now listen to this. So, I get back in my car. I have another half hour to kill before five o'clock. No, this was this back in the car wither without slices. Without the slalom, the leading. Okay. The slices. So, Neil, I go back and I do not know why I just made with this place. I go to little seizures. I'm dying for a piece of pizza. Yeah. If I get a piece of pizza, I ask, now Neil, I ask for a large diet coke. She says, we don't have any ice. I only talk. Yeah, but at least that slices. Listen to this. There is supposed to get the slices out there and get the large.coke back. You know, don't you get it? Neil, she says to me, the policy of the chain now is that we do not have ice machines in the rest of the time. I know what you talk. You mean me to tell me if you have a, let's say you have a family of twelve that comes in here that once twelve diet coke. Yeah. You mean the tell me you have no ice. Well, how expensive is it to make ice? I mean, what's the cost of making ice? That's the policy of the chain. Are they saving on the water ball? They're going to do it for you now. It was give you a can of coke or a can of whatever you want. See, yeah. You're not going there and get a cup of ice in a cup. What should it, what you were in steams? You should have asked for a cup of ice. Neil, this is what we are going through in our, in today's world. Okay. Well, thank you. We have an open line. This guy, do you wish he had his problems? Oh, do I wish I had his problems? Well, this is this guy's major problem is this slices weren't ready at steams. And they got in the license, little seasers, which anybody goes in the little seasers in the first place. Does there ever get no ice? They're not sitting down in each place as any way. They're just pick up and take home. Yeah. See, there's no place to sit on. Oh, my God. How would you like to work in one of those places dealing with people like this? Huh? How is, oh, I don't want to say because I know that there are people out there listening to me right now who work in retail. All I can say is, I have all the rough, all the pity in the world for those of you who work in retail in this town. I got the button at least here, okay? Like my good friend, watching in there, Marcy, over Walgreens, got all mighty. At least I can hang up on him. We have an open line in date, 567560, Pound 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Where's the goddamn ice? Oh, 1255 in QA. If you're shopping for a computer system, don't settle for the two systems at the MegaStores offer you. Visit our friends at computer Renaissance, where you can actually buy a complete system. If you're going to get a job, liver or something, what about Rodney McDonald? How about her? Oh, that book of Brian, you are so depressing. I'm telling you, come sit at a bop-ba-ba-ba. I mean, don't take it personally unless you want to. But hey, you'll feel better tomorrow night with an ice cream meal. In fact, I'll bring you that check tomorrow night. It's a pizza law. How's that Brian? Is that okay? No. What, what, what am I not? Two open lines in Broward, 567560, will be drawing for the winner of those tickets at 145. You better get on the list right now, you idiot. In section 101, the opening game of the regular season, the first ever regular season game in a goddamn new macarine of their incineries, the Panthers and the very marginal Tampa Bay lightning, at least they got Rob Zamann or anyway. That's about all I got. And that kid will accommodate him. All we want to start with that, because then people say, if we want to go to number one draft pick, thank God Victor Coslov's going to be great, because if he weren't going to be great, there would be a lot of people wanting BM's ice for making that trade exchange for an ever-one draft pick, which is good Tampa got. Look like he's going to be a superstar. So come on, Victor, we don't want to put too much pressure on you, but we will anyway. And what was wrong with what I said before about Billi-Mansie and Ray Whitney? We want to see Ray Whitney naked. They're on a goddamn map panther weekly. I guarantee you might get a one share. You might get an audience for that. You idiot? There's a mobile and medley, hello. Neil? Yes sir. Neil, all day yesterday, I was watching that stupid thousand game and I was saying to everybody my house, thanks to that. And Neil, I got to say something, this is funny. It's absolutely funny. And every fort Neil, if you cut out the rep, you'd better have words to get thrown out of the game. Right? I'm going to go in. Yeah, I'm going to go in. Oh, and I was turning the radio up to see if he's still on the air. Okay, we got two open lines in day, an FU 2-Pel, two open lines in day, five six seven, five six, six the in prom five, six the on the 18-T. No picker lines. Yeah, that's what we got to have a no picker line. Here's plantation, hello. Plantation. Going once. Going twice. Thank God he was there on Saturday, too. By the way, the guy was the guy was okay. If I'd probably the guy with the eyes of the voice himself from these losers, which is why he got on his wrist behavior. Two open lines in day, county five six seven, five, six the in prom five, six the on the 18-T line. Here's a mobile in day, be hello. Neil, why do you let us come back like grammar on you, show it. I mean, it's nice. Okay, there we go again. There's that Mitch, asshole, asshole alert. Mobile in West Palm Beach, hello. Painial. Yes, sir. I just wanted to tell you that I, from heart for Connecticut originally, and then moved up to Canada for lived in much, she all with all those French-speaking people there. All right, couple years. How adorable, it's frogs. Well, frogs actually, and I moved down here. Love hockey, there was the the only good thing about them is that they got me to love hockey, but the best thing now is that the Canadian dollar being down that down the drain. They can't come down right there. We might be able to wait for the winter. Thank God. Yeah, I was just wondering if I could stick around to be on the left. Okay, sure. Hang on. Put that coupon list. We have an open line and date one in Broward five six seven, five, six, seven, five, six the on the 18-T wireless line. The next deck is down ninety. The dollars down plenty, which if they ever put the God name, they're 168. The economy of the world is going to happen to hand mask it. And these self-righteous sanctimonious hypocrites like this, Bill McCollum, this good old boy Redneck from Florida, who's on there right now on CNN. But I mean, but about the same old card crap, same old garbage. I mean, it is clear as a bell. You don't have to be a rocket scientist to see what this whole thing is all about. And to see where the hell can stars from and all the funding for this came from. You don't have to be a genius. All you got to do is read just a little bit between the lines and around the edges. But they can't figure it out. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Okay. I would listen to the show. These people are calling about the arena. The nor arena. It's good if it's bad. I mean, come on. They were complaining about the older arena where the location of work. And now they're never happy. Here's here. They always have to have something to bitch in dollars. They know about life as a work loving. They go to a concept about the acoustic sit down and hear the damn concert. It'll care of the damn acoustic. Whatever. You know, ridiculous. Can I get on the list? Okay. Pretty weak. Where we going? Let's go to the one that's got the 400 question marks. This could be a record for question marks on one line. Okay. So it must be a little bit. But I want that one's evergreen. What is evergreen? Colorado. A mobile and evergreen Colorado with 400 question marks, hello. Nail. Yes, sir. I bought this box into a island smoke shop and evergreen Colorado. I'm down here today, but I'm still calling on a Colorado mobile just because it's only 11 cents a minute around the country. So I'm not well, right? Make a long story short. I'm walking this little Feasors in every green about a month ago. And the smoke is so thick when you walk in. You'll wonder if anybody's working there. You hear rap music so loud you can't even. I'm screaming for somebody to come out. So I can get a pizza, right? Yeah. Why don't you smoke? It wasn't pizza smoke. What are you looking at? The free crack is that what you're knocking there. It was hard to believe. I'll just say that. So I'm screaming. I'm not screaming. I'm getting loud. I'm screaming. I'm still saying the kick comes out. Let me hit the kick comes out. And he says, what would you like. And he's been in my shop before. So listen, what's going on here? The cop's walk and you guys are going to the jail. Yeah. It says, well, some guy will repeat. So he came in here. He scared us so bad. We're, this kid's raking your走了. He says. He's scared us so bad. And we got so stressed that we had a smoke I called. And he says this old guy's scared us so bad. So, there we have just a couple of bulls to calm down. There you go. These are 18 years old. that last piece of call I heard I did say what goes on in Colorado. And here we're listening. There are going to be a lot of people moving out there right away. Thanks for the good news. Evergreen Colorado. Who do you want to go? It ain't Amsterdam. It ain't Vancouver Woods. It's the next guy named thing. He wishes me to get the smell of water. He wishes me to get the smell of water. Some of the things that they've been around here, you run to the wall already. Not the bowl, he's talking about. We have an open line in date 560560 on the 18-T. The waterless line. All right, I'll write it with that. Cut it out. Oh, is this been something man? Let's see. Tuesday 4 today is the fifth day in the world. Seriously, I'm not going to do any injury to my self besides overeating. Well, isn't that. You just want to blow somebody's brain, just fill them all over the goddamn, all of the nice Brooks Brothers soon. Here's a lady in Daniel. Hello. Daniel? Yes, ma'am. Why isn't your TV show current at night? I beg your pardon. You know what night we watch you on TV? It's going to be crazy. It's going to be current. Are you listening to me? Are you listening to me? Yes, sir. It's going to be current tonight. I want to show. But then it's going to be often about three or four weeks. It'll be finished. No. Yes. Oh, what can we do to stop that? Nothing. The way that the way the audience could have done something to stop that was to watch at these last, though. Let's see. June, July, August, September, last four months. They could have watched it today. We were watching it. I don't know more interest. They had no more interested in watching the TV show. They may do it calling the radio show. So that's my lawyer, Laudian, shot there. Well, we're new. People didn't show up at borders on Saturday and 4 Loderedale. Where we were hoping to have a line of 200 people. And we had like 30 or 40. We're new in town. Right. Let me ask you something. Do you have that monitor? Yes. I understand that she was offered millions of dollars to be on TV. Right. Do you think maybe she could afford to get her direct clean? Maybe now. This is me. Yes. Mom. Mommy's $50. Okay. Have a great day. Okay. We have an open line of Broward 560560. Are you sure positive? And one in that's it. 560 on the AT&T Wireless Line. Let's do pizza talk. Let's hear about little Caesars. Let's hear about Steve's and our slices. Let's hear about the didn't give you no goddamn ice. Go home and get your own ice. Okay. Cheapskate. He wants ice with his can of soda. How do you like that? This guy's the ever satisfied? No. Will you want him coming in to your store? No. Please. We're begging you. Don't come to the pizza lot tomorrow night. No. In fact, if that guy shows up at the lot tomorrow, I'm going to have Jeff kick his answer. Hey. Now the TV thing was just a bit our impediment. That's the a trigger in a wood pond. That's the only thing preventing the show from being on. Not just statewide. Not just nationwide. But worldwide. All over the goddamn freaking world. Then we'd have some goddamn calls. Now that this TV, this bogus thing, I want to say those people really made a great commitment to this show. You know what? Vicki and sticky. They made a tremendous commitment to this show. Yeah. Let's slide it on over here. Stick it over there. Fill it. We were like silly putty. Stick it in the cracks. They have a little crack problem. Anywhere there's a crack. Stick it in the crack. There's a crack over there. Stick it in there. As in. All right. But hey, was there good that Joe was out there at the borders on Saturday? Was the wrong border as but was a good start? A little bit late. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, hello. Yes, sir. Yeah, please don't call it in Mike. I just want to know your take on Jimmy Johnson. Do you think he's taking this whole running game thing a little to see? Yes, sir. I'm here. Are you doing that? Hey, the phones have been smoking all day. I've been busy all day. Have a nice day. They have. Maybe in Howard, Dave County's been comatose. I'm in North Miami. The good news, you'll be pleased to know the people in data departing. They're all getting out. If they move back to the day, the coast will be clear. Yeah, exactly. What's the reason for when we're taking you off? You're asking me? Well, you know, the readings suck because we don't have enough diaries out there. Yeah. Or machines. I mean, everybody's watching. I want to keep arguing. I'm going to I can only tell you this over the weekend. I go to Amico to get gas. They're like four people in their getting gas. Every one of them tells me they watched it. Every one of knows me number one. Number two, they watch the show. I go to public last night to the grocery to get three or four things. People in there, I've never heard of before. People I would know if, you know, they're all watching the guy name show. They all know who I am and they like it. But they can't, they cannot, they cannot find the audience for that show. They just cannot find it. Well, because there's only four and twenty seven diaries. In addition, in addition, a wits, they're doing so no promotion. There has been none. There has been zero pro. They had like one stick in billboard up there other than that. They've had no promotion. They wasted all that money in the new show on the station. But conspicuously leaves out this. He doesn't even acknowledge that we exist. Even though they were running the show twice tonight for most of the last three months. They pretend to show doesn't even exist on that guy damn thing. And it's the best show on the station. Well, there you go. I agree. Yeah, me too. Okay, pal. Can I be on the list? Sure, hang on. You bet. We have an open line of day. I mean, is it going to change my line? No, are they still going to have to pay us for next eight months or whatever it is? Yeah, so if they take it off the week here, I mean, what the hell are we going to do without Joe clunk it around with that ladder in here and then knocking things around? What are we going to do then? Plus will be upstairs anyway. See, that's an interesting part of this timing, too. Is that we're moving up to our palatial new studios up on the third floor here allegedly? Starting in November? The name probably have to like break this whole thing down. And then them all would have they do? Well, what would they do at that point? Or maybe even run some camera cables all the way from up on the third floor all the way down to here. Do you think they could handle that? No. I mean, we're talking about a major major investment of effort there, which of course, like I said, the very drilling room. Why don't here? Because there's no room for them upstairs. Like I said, while it's been a lot of fun, it certainly didn't do us any harm. Did it be such making me look like a jackass? Oh, it was pretty good. We have an open line. And I don't like being made a look like a jackass. Open line in day five, six, seven, five, sixty and pound five, sixty on the AT&T line. Actually, I enjoy being made look like a jackass. I love it. That's why I'm wearing these stupid beans on my head. I want to be a jackass. I'm going to do a great job of it till I don't tell me I'm not. Look who I went to work for here, huh? Talk about being a jackass. You know, Book of Ridingham have a good point. Excellent point. Well, seriously, you were occasionally with all the other depressing stuff you spue out. He said, how is it possible that these people don't care about their sponsors? And they don't. I mean, you heard these little five-year-old kids doing tags on spots that people are paying for. We can't, we can't beg. I mean, big copy out of people so that we can do an effective job for our clients. I don't want to mention Gary Sarner by name again, but especially him. And the center one thing, I mean, if we didn't just do this and make an automatic pilot project, would it ever have happened? Of course not. Of course not. You know, the old days back going all the way back to when Halcyon, I remember Halcyon, but he does. When Halcyon was there, little Halcyon over at IOD, and she used to call for the, you know, the totals. For the, here's the, a peaches, totals. Here's the totals. Those were the days. And every morning, in fact, the one day she didn't have me, she was in tears there because I made an ass out of her, whatever it was. But she was right on top of it, even at Bits, Sarah over there, who was a hard nose, but even she used to come in every day and with the eraser and put the new total up there, whether it was Camille's house or center one or whatever we were collecting for at the time to try to do something good in the community. Besides, I just be on here and try to flee some money out of everybody, which most radio stations do. And we come over here and we beg them, hire Tracy Keroset. And this guy is a good guy. He's a great promotions guy. He's done the dolphin thing before the network. He's done the center one thing. Oh, yeah, that sounds like a great idea. And then behind our back they're going, oh yeah, like we're going to pay him. Are they going to pay him? No, they're going to really pay somebody to do a job. No. No, they got, they got the relatives in here. They got the nephew. And they got Sam, which ain't it. They're quite a thing. Got the stuff out there. The boarders, that's about all. They showed up there Saturday at the right place. And that was about it. But they involved in, you know, getting this. And now poor Carol over there, it's said, now she's the pivot man. Now she's the one that's got to do all the work that the promotions person who doesn't exist here on his radio station should do. So they didn't care about their sponsors. They don't really care about what's on the year. They don't care about the center one campaign. They don't care about anything. They just want to work right. See, they ought to get out of A.M. Just like the Cox people did. Just get those FM's flush stations like Power 96 and coast and how 105. And crank out the hits with an S with two S's. Because they don't give a good. They're not interested in going through the effort of really being a real radio station. It's a joke to them. So pay them in the ass. Then he's and they've got a bunch of, especially in the sales department of such a spoiled fool's of working in there. I don't want to mention Gary Sarner again who've been allowed to just do whatever it only wanted for years and years and years. And nobody ever said, hey, guess what? This is half past, Mr. Putting a bunch of three year old kids on here to do. Hey, go down here. Yeah, we put that Lenny kid on. I don't want to knock him because he may be a pretty good guy. Well, I don't know who knows anything about him, huh? Tonight on the hysterical channel, famous radio miles towards a real active radio's greatest moments performed by the mochi talented Leo Dynamo. Lenny Margez. Yeah, there you go. We have it open line in date 560505060 on the AT&T line. Here's a lady mobile in Miami, hello. Hello? Yes, man. I knew this one's in the East of one loyal female listener. Great. You're it. Um, maybe I know this? No. We have it open line in date one in Broward 567. What are you laughing about? She's going to be on the list for saying that. I'm just calling and sucking around. I got plenty of women out there. Okay, including a couple of called here and had something to say today. Can I be on the list? Another lady for a free loader market down. Okay. They won't talk to me for a lover money this women. What I got something to give away, boy. All of a sudden, just like somebody said Saturday at our parents' borders, isn't it interesting to see the difference in the way the caller is behave when you got something to give away? Then all of a sudden, everybody's real friendly. Hey, we love you. You're the best at TV show. It's great. Can I be on a guy damn list? But when we got nothing to give away, you suck you, set of you. No good money. Yeah, like a jury's finger show. That's it. Just one after another. We have an open line in date one in Broward. You only got 24 minutes until we start doing that drawing for these goddamn tickets. Section 101 there. Opening the first game ever in the history of the first real regular season game in the history of the macarina. And I got open lines on here. And I'm pushing date County all day. Feel like Jackie Bales, I feel like a Jimmy Carter, like I'm pushing push in Bosnia or some crap like that. Push in phone lines on here. So I got a management top stare that doesn't give a crap. We got the whammy people are like in the twilight zone. That wouldn't know a goddamn TV station to be stuck at an air echo. We got that. And then we got an audience who also it must be catching. They're also so indifferent that it's terrifying. Here's Orlando. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. That was the bad plot to wake that jury spring a bit. Yeah. Yeah. Anyway, he's a real motherf***er. Yes, me. You thought there's seven border stores have your city? Eight. Like that, non. They're up in Orlando. They're not there, but I work like next to borders. I went in there, sorry, not at $40 to your total. Well, thank you. That's great. There's something out my two CDs. You can't put it. All right. Excellent. I'm going to actually some radio question there. Oh. Yeah. How happy trails are whatever. Anyway, Ron and Fels are on in the local market again. Yeah. And last week on real radio, they had Dylan because they were on vacations and rather in Tate. Yeah. Who they had on the air, brought in. She would come and do things. It was Aaron. Oh. Aaron slumber was on air. Correct. Oh, what a suck past. That must have been so embarrassing with you, too. Yeah. It's rock. And you know who her mentor is. Yeah. Oh, it's real. Oh, I don't know. Why are you putting a lot of people on the street? I mean, I'm very grateful to skies. I'm a lawyer, listener. He went up there and gave us the $40% of one. He's going to love the CDs. But we just can't get that message across. Do we care about the people from Orlando? No. The radio people. No. We care about the Tampa people since there aren't any. We care about them. No. Here's a Davy. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I got this. Okay. About that asshole they called about it. What do you want? I've got about the pizza crisis. Oh, yeah. Okay. I work at a pizza joint in Western. Okay. I've all placed as a bunch of rich, rich, rich, rich, rich. All they wanted to free the anyway. Okay. And I got a, you know, a misicent manager. So they called me up and they're like, oh, you know, it's too hot, too cold. We get just as many calls saying it's been there too soon as too late. I mean, what's that about? And then you have to have two soon? Yeah. They're like, well, you said we're going to be third. Yeah. My right. There's only one thing I can think of in life that can happen too soon. It's not getting your pizza. Yeah, right? Anyway, and then I got to sit there and kiss their ass. I got to say, yes, they're new through. Would you like to, if I go someplace and I don't like to product, I don't like the service. I'm not going to do, I'm not going to go back there. I'm not going to go back there. I'm going to do a boat to favor. If you don't like it, don't come back. Right. I'm going to suck around for anything. If I want something all by myself. Yeah, I'm going to suck around for anything. If I want something all by myself. Yeah, I'm going to. Okay. See. Okay. Let's hear it for that poor guy. That's to put up with all these assholes out there. Oh, they didn't have my ice and they didn't have the slices ready when I wanted. Boy, oh, boy, oh boy. This kid did this kid couldn't have been too spoiled, but he was a kid, could he? Uh-huh. He's down on his own toys when he was a kid. He probably had everybody in the neighborhood's toys, too. Like about two years ago. Jesus. Here's a mobile and sunrise, hello. Oh, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing Neil? Great. It's kind of hard to follow that last color, but I'll play you a white. I was at the concert last night. And it was just great. Thereino, it's great. And you know what? I was just standing right behind Elton John. We were in the second 3.26. You can see all the flavors right there in the front road. The on crazy. On the screeners. Oh, crazy. Crazy, crazy, crazy. But it was a really good time. It's really, really, really great. And I'm just glad that I just have like one pair. Actually compared to the Miami arena, which was, it was all clocked up, even just across the street from the parking lot. It was a nightmare. And now we got this big spacious, beautiful place with every amenity you could ever want. There's no question about it. They still got nothing but complain. I mean, you just can't complain to one with the other. I mean, I mean, I mean, maybe arena, please. I'll be just a drive down there for those of us who live in Brower. Just a drive down there and back was enough to make you want to blow your brains out. And you know what, look, the people were from Brower. You think it was a wheel like me. We're going to the hockey game. No, no. But I'm, well, anyway, in close your nail. Hey. I just think that this is the best thing for Brower County. And I'm just happy today. It's over here. Okay. You take care of the old. I'll see you there. We have two open lines in Brower. In 26 past the out. I mean, we got like 19 minutes to go before we do the drawing. This year gets my tickets for opening night in the brand new macarina. Campus in the attempt of a lightweight. Are they all up tight about that? No, it worked out to a frenzy. How they fall on over each other? Get to the phone? No. They don't care. Don't you understand? They don't care. Even for free now, it's become old head. Maybe if we put in 500 bucks for food. Speaking of food, if you're looking for a 50-wildest line, we got to move along here, man. Here's a mobile and Marguid. Hello. Yes, sir. It's up to call. Bring on. I'm Saturday. My death stuff. The pleasure to make a donation. Thank you so much. I want to say, part one is great. Part two is the tactical. Sensational. That's what I tell everybody. Especially putting in your own stuff, that we have the right. Every other bit. And unedited. Unedited. Right. One other thing. Please. I beg you. Don't put remoron anymore. What? You can do it. If information that he gave before was so ponderous and you. Was that unbelievable? I mean, he calls back. And I'm sitting here just my life is splashing in front of my eyes. And I'm thinking, well, there must be something that happened. We're putting on it. And he calls back to tell us basically that nothing happened. And he's going to just say nothing happened. He has to go through the list of these Martian names of people that haven't been born yet of embryotic anonymous people. You know, if he said that mower was gone or partnered with Ryan, then we would have had a party right? Yeah. We can't be in the street with mower guy. He's got this guy named Shabbat from the Kabat house. Yeah. You put. Please don't put him on anymore. Okay. Bet your life on it. Oh. Oh, yeah. We got to do another hockey show. Oh, my God. Ponderous. This is not hockey town. What's the point? It would be like going up to a cali-wit and doing a show on soccer. What's the point? Be like going to the middle of God Day and the Siberian. Doing a goddamn show about the Shini hockey. Oh, they played up there? Okay. Well, they got in the prime of the only one that much else to do. Man, he is a scary, you know. Good guy in his own bizarre way. And I'm still trying to figure out what that is. But he can chase an audience the way faster than Mike Spindell. I'm the, the, the, the music that we play to, uh, I think you've got a lot better. Yeah. I play music to intentionally try to get the audience to call just so that they want to get the music off. And he works better than any day the week. In fact, since he made his second call, you notice every line on the board is smoking. Since he made that second call. Please, they're begging. Please don't put him on again. We'd rather hear Jersegaek farting for four hours that he'll remember again for 10 seconds. Or then I chopped that off. Jersegaek. Yeah. Yeah, he was chopped off. He didn't even enjoy. 21 before two at three. He, he, he, he, he. What's this obsession with hope? Yeah. Okay, 144, we're getting re-promadness over here, crap. But I put it. Oh, it's not. I'm trying to do our drawing, I guess, for my two tickets. That's that's 57 bucks a piece. That's 114 bucks plus the parking pass to preferred park. That's about $130 worth of crap and only cost whoever wins it about 200 bucks per food for the two of you. So what's other complainin' about? And I'm giving him a wikker so I'm not gonna be here. Friday, Friday night, 730. Panthers in the 10th of a lightning. There'll be a big show. That's what I'm a big thing to win for. I mean, an exhibition game. There were exhibition games. I tried to tell you that. There was nobody watching this exhibition hockey games. There's no intensity. There's no meaning. It's like a dill at around. It's like one step away from watching a skimage. What's the real stuff starts in any sport? Then you got something to hope for. Hop. That being the upper to the board. Are we getting that peer or shallvets? Are we getting them? Okay, now let me draw one of these out of my own. Look at this. Out of the neola with the, oh, what he. You're on the. Well, all the exploders on it. The blue one. Hey, better start taking notes by the way, because that whammy thing's going off about November 5th. So for this next money better take notes which day he had to ride. That's the blue shirt today. So you know, it's the right day because we're doing it tonight. He's got the brown yarmac on one of the neola fish symbol on it. And the winner of the hockey ticket. Now, see, didn't you didn't put a. Why do you do that? You didn't put a line under days of the, I guess it's a six, okay? Or is it a nine? Well, they did look different. Is that a six? Yes, you're positive. Well, wait a minute. Let me just find the nine here first. Okay. The nine has a stick in the six is all curvy. The nine has a stick. Oh, yeah, you're right. Okay, number six whoever was number six. Well, must be Patrick Lourne. Huh? Norma. Norma. Norma. Oh, Norma. No, Norma. No, Norma. Okay, Norma. When it don't say the name on the air, okay, they're guys to say the name of the crowd. All right. I'll take it. That was official round not 발 ground. A he Spot cut. How long will he be at the grandigns next door? Ready for my cut. I don't need. I mean, so good. Well, you did well. Well, yeah, true. That's really good, but yeah, I totally shouldn't be armed for him. This zie. So, we can't say. Combined game memory. Sorry. Well, we could imagine that when we got out, This is a mission to this game up there. Don't he still doing here? Here's a mobile implantation, hello. Yes sir. Oh yeah. Okay. I don't know whether you checked out. I'm the subject too. I tested. Okay. He still has caught him. Oh, it's broke for us. What about the temporary that that intermediate trading deadline that they put in there? That's the past. They can start making a lot of trades. It'll happen. I guarantee it. Because if you got the club parking, you don't know about the other parking. For me, just it's about a few yards. You take the first left turn. You're right there. There's the traffic light. You're right back on 136th. Panther Parkway. You're right there. Because it blocked off. We went to the first game. I can't walk. And they blocked off. Overly. It took one lane going. Southbound 130th. Right. Well, what's up? They did that that night too. But luckily, we left after one period because it's an exhibition.
