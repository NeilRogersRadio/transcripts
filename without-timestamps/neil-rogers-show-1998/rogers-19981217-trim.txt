The opinions of Neal is guest callers, or anyone else on the show do not necessarily reflect those of WQAM, easily read acquisitions, or the easily broadcast group. Now Neal Rodgers on Sports Radio 560QAM, it works the lotion in the basket. I ride, we've not removed, it should take a day, let us just put a nanny to it's own. I ride, I ride, I want to wake up and see if cities don't exist, hope in thin air and tell that God will save them. We're really pissed, you're on the ice game, that little piece of shit. Ain't yet move away, I'll get some of the makeup hits from the blue door, the sound has just to go off that now. We all know we're going to bomb, oh I ride, I ride. Okay Ayera Wake up and see there's tunnels all month or fifty and say that with number one for the heat We can't be seen, but can't we have one? Ah, I'm in our hands. One and a half today. Let's take your heart to the bottom of this. That old Zahra. Ah, when all the fortune there, I'll do a show with that kick there and say good bye. Ah, I'm right. I'm right. Thank you, did. Ouch. So 10-04-05-60WQM, let's hear it. There you go. We're going to bond into the stone age. If you have a good time, see if the Bootsman would have done it right in 1991, we wouldn't have to be in there doing this all over again. But you know something? We are. And I say, ah, right. Is what I say. And of course, there are assholes out there like Robert Greeper, who knows he running to board today. What is the story? We're doing this running around here. Oh, he just running around being a jackass. If I've told him once, I've told him nine times that, you know, he better get with the program. I think that before anybody gets elected to public office in this country, they ought to be subjected to a rabies test. Well, seriously, because we had some rabid lunatics running around last night, I've trapped a lot of course, who's busy attacking, you know, let's see, Jews and blacks and the fags and the who else. Everybody else. Put the maniacs, alcohol, they're all the same. And he had definitely needed the rabies test, but Gerald Solomon of New York. Oh, what is with it? Usually, you know? Right in the middle of Hanukkah, we've got this problem. Some of our most embarrassing people have been turned loose, and we can't put a leash on him. You've had Monica Lewinsky and her rabid mother. You've got the ultra rabid, Alusian gold bird. Who might leave him out? Robert Greeper? There you go. I've told him, nine hundred times. And now we got Gerald Solomon that rabid, a little bit of congressman from New York, who's on their last night. Right after we started seeing the bomb is bursting in air, we were all going, you know, like that. And he gets on there on CNN. And he is carrying on like a man who is just on acid. I mean, just out of his mind, out of control. How could he do this? And then of course within a couple of hours, you know, some of the more reasonable people are saying, well, you know, we talked to the Secretary of State, and we talked to the Secretary of Defense, William Cohen, as a former Republican Senator from Maine, and we were briefed him and beat pedigable. And I guess what we think this is the right time. And it's okay. And speech will have to go on the back burner for a day or two or three or four, while we're bombing into the Stone Age. Since they're over there busy making the anthrax and other, you know, chemical weapons, etc. So here we are, boys and girls, and so far this morning, 74% of the American public are saying, yeah, we like it. We support it. We like it, we're all for it. Only 13% say, oh, we don't like it. And the rest of us are saying, where? And if that's what they're saying, listen, if you went out on this is the honesty got true. By the way, there's the Iraqi Foreign Minister, who says, no, no, we can condense it down. He said, oh, if he said, but if you went out on the street and you had a map of the world, if you had a globe, not an ol' boy, you, but when I was a kid, I had a globe of the world, okay? Which was very helpful. Plus I was a stamp collector as a kid, which was totally useless as far as making any money with it, but nevertheless, I learned, uh, mags, uh, coach, uh, whatever that thing was from hungry, and all life good stuff, including countries that don't exist anymore, like say, line, which is now that little turd that tree-lank under that the India, you turd dumped out. But at any rate, so I learned like where the different countries in the world were, and even where all the different states are. And yeah, I think that most of us who've gotten IQ larger than our thumbnail can look at a map of the US without any names on the state. I'm like, tell you, here's New York, and here's Indiana, and here's Oklahoma. Yeah, I think most people, I'm not talking about intellectuals. I'm not talking about rockets, I'm just talking about rationing. I'm just talking about rational ordinary people who've got any modicum of intelligence, who do not be asking too many questions. They can figure out finger outward is, but if you were to ask them to point out Iraq on the map of the world, on the globe, they couldn't do it. They couldn't even begin to know where the stick is. They would be looking in there. Right, don't even all over the place. See, a little bit of education, I know what's the dangerous thing, but let me tell you one thing. It puts the notion in the basket. That's right. For whatever that means. And then, of course, Fred Grimm this morning, right? So, I don't know what to make of these columnists. You know, everyone, about once a year, somebody's guys write a good column. Like Fred Grimm, he wrote a great column here a couple of months ago that I was raving about on the year. I figured what it was about. Silence, not golden. And he's writing about how most of us are rational, you know, we support bubble and we're against the impeachment and this and that and play, shall got a big in calls. And he thinks it was a set up deal. And he's looking about for impeachment. And then in the end, he talked about how Hillary has fallen strangely. Silent right now. Like what is she supposed to be saying about this? Huh? I mean, the only thing Hillary is probably muttering a lot of these days is that's fucking bitch. Yeah, like that. Probably not in his quite as deep a voice as we barely, but similar sentiment. He says most of us, even in Democratic Grower, they're right there with Hillary a groundswell of being unquiet. In other words, they thought that once the impeachment thing got on the verge of that, everybody was going to be screaming and carrying on. And it was big, you know. But I think now that we decided we're going to over there and bond the submission. And by the way, the air raid sirens went off about a half an hour ago. Now, yesterday about a half hour after they first went off. The bomb was started bursting near. Okay, we saw the anti-correct fire first. And then we realized that the cruise missiles were dropping all over the place. And this is going to be a daily event. So it is now like a nine minute factor six in the PM and over and bag that. How come Dan Raddivy? The way can't figure out eight hours ahead. Did you see that last night? It was shortly after five after the attack started. And he's on there saying, well, let's see. If so, one o'clock at the morning, oh, a two o'clock. Isn't it a two o'clock at the morning? No, Dan. It's eight hours. Five plus eight is like midnight plus one. That's a, you know, follow over. No, it's two in the morning. How much is he's making about 20 million dollars a year? I love Dan Raddivy. Don't get me wrong. He can't add, but he sure can multiply. So what's the frequency, Dan? Not sure if he is not kind of embarrassing. Don't you think Walter Kronkut is sitting back in his chair with his big. With something in his post, how rump thing and saying, what's the matter with you, Dan? Yeah. Can't you figure out eight hours? I mean, like eight hours from now is that ten after six p.m. Isn't it? Last night, my check. So it's dark over there right now, and it's going to get a lot darker, I think. Ten minutes after ten at five, 60, WQM. You got it. No, it's not inside him. A lot more than done. They say they're with us. The man's the girl at some. I say we're standing. A couple may have the time. I'll be around. All right. In the Gulf of Austin, then in the hospital. I think it's time to give his brother a hold. So it's time to know those people to honor him. Ow! I'll be around until there's nothing left to see. I'll be around until Saturday, 60, five here on. Blow up the tree. I'll be around. Yeah. And then say it's got some sun. They're coming closer to the sun. I'll be around. You're playing with the sun. We're going to do it. Because I'm in the house for this day. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. I'll be around. Okay. Let's go over with three or four days. Yeah. I'll be dropping it again very soon. It's dark. It's getting dark. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. I'll be right back.

I'll maybe right at Monday or Tuesday to Monday. Me tendermen or I roleized again, Pretty soon if we get you know if we figure out enough loot additional be down in nine percent If you take out your ol' Solomon and Trent Laud it's already down to a little underdying percent I think right Robert what do you expect from Robert? He's had a tough life, you know? He probably he probably saw that the hustle and magazine they held up at the hockey game on the thing last night He's probably going to a change of life right now. Well, what's that what are those and what's that? Yeah, what's that here we thing Yeah, somebody last night since we do need more entertainment Although we didn't have a very entertaining game last night night's going on birthday times We'd heart-played a great game for us about time once I told you once a month He'll play like that then the rest of the time he's in the toilet But that was very entertaining at the macaroon We had a good crowd of raking thousand last night a little later arriving because I'm sure many of you want to stay home to watch the bombs bursting in air Watch Cristiana Amon tour and in fact we were taking it. You know, I'm not really sure do we want to get Sodom first or her. I'm not really sure What would give me greater pleasure? I mean, obviously we want to give him which is not you know That's gonna be very difficult. Any hers a piece of cake Kind of as a payback for the crap that she pulled on a pope was down in Cuba and she was the she had her pom-poms in her little cross And you know and her rosary beads was doing her cheerleading routine posing as a news catcher during that time And my favorite moment of the evening last night was when she just said oh, there's just a bullet just hit up here on the road I don't think I'm going any closer. This is gonna be my vantage point and not the next as far as I'm going right there. Okay That was beautiful So we'll find out if the public is whipped up and we'll friends you about this today Okay, I said nice going life now. I do I you know we had some more technical problems. I heard the guy talking about it this morning Luckily after the first period we got those straight now to meet $200 million macaroon, which we just can't seem to get our hands together First period penalty clock Special aid gets a dumb penalty and the penalty clock does it work? No, it's sitting there And other announcing and then delay in the game see these delays these pondress delays I mean it makes you think I'm not ever gonna get there a lot of hearing you wonder why all those people leave like It's getting to be two in the morning. It's about time we better get home Because by the time we get home, it's gonna be time to get up and go to work in the morning So it's kind of not conducive to people sticking around to the rain and believe me they don't they do not We've got a whole week got thousands of people to come to the sporting event and after the second period The scores one one makes no difference time to go home Time to go home they're gone and you'll look up at the dwelling must be out getting another we need another beer something They'll take us gone they're not coming back. They're gone How come I'm hearing that echo back I might is that because we're on this other line today something really weird perhaps Well, I don't care. I'm not gonna worry about And one of the things that I found you know So we had the disruptions with the penalty clock with the final got fixed and then we had the horn go off Thank God they kept playing the horn was two in somebody was two in during the game last night. No two in during the game by the way You understand if you got it Thank you no two in while the game is in progress three times in the same short span of time the your horn went off briefly And then And people are like what's going on here what kind of a bush league operation is this but speaking of bush league my favorite moment of that game last night in the third period Stubborns who's in a coma. You know, he's a squeaky guy's ever real bad slow-bright now Nice going Marty struck him by the way, but then he rate He's skating across the center. Why he's got the puck in the crowd start going Stooosh light like the old days. I guess what he don't play for us anymore. Okay, they do that in Pittsburgh He's one of them now These people as they need instruction this little button struck. No, be okay 26 after 10 at 5 60 W QM But Whichy Martin But you have a witchy in your role Now turn the record over for a wreckage like which lesson number two. I think number two just is Open over again. Okay, it's 10 31 by the way, even little Jimmy Carter. Remember Jimmy anybody remember him? No from planes Joe Joe. No, I don't remember him, but anyway, he even he's saying that anybody who would even dare suggest Anybody who would have the audacity to suggest that there's political motivation behind this since we've known it's coming Anyway for a weeks and months now anybody who would suggest that should probably be taken out a course with it very least or something including Gerald Solomon and especially Trent Lock rabbit. Let me say it again rabies test for everybody Okay, we're not getting like a tremendous immediate response here from the audience out there Maybe Fred Grimm is got a point. Maybe they just when you come right down But don't give a flying crap. That could be it Open line and proud all day. They'd had it by the way. They're bombin' Iraq anybody and they heard about it yet. No, okay They're a little slow don't get the message soon as the a cockfight's you're over 560 50560 pound five 60 on the mobile one line Gonna be an exciting day here on the show.

I'm I'm a little one about what's going on over there You know and the reason why is because I would I would have liked to have seen this be a more definitive And to a means you know throwing blood, I'm not this was blindly over there and they don't don't think I'm being critical of Of the decision to do it. I think you should have been done all on time. Why do you say blindly? You know, they don't have any of the games. They don't have any of the game plan. Is that what you're saying? This thing has been in the works for months. They in fact are wrong last night detailing All right, no, no, no, no, you don't know what I'm saying when I say blindly. I mean that time on missile is gonna Is gonna hit its target most of the time Okay, but a you know a ground for is an air strike is gonna be more on Target every time Agreed, so you said I would you think we ought to have a ground troop so that what you're saying? I'm saying that is the first time they were there. They should have fed us the damn job Of course, but that's so we can't turn the clock back seven years. Boots didn't do it, you know But doing this is not gonna resolve anything He's still gonna be able to hide everything that he needs to hide. How do you know that? Really if you hear if we knew about it all this time, don't you think he knew about it? And he's been moving troops around and he's moving. I'm not troops, but it is his weapon Around yeah, well, you know, hey, I mean you move your check-a-board Around you know Talk about some maybe the best way to describe it is as a containment exercise and it's to uh, you know Percent in back every time we were gonna have to do this set in back a few years until people over there until he loses any popular support And they started to throw his ass out of there Absolutely, so I have a revolution because they can't sustain anymore That's right. That's the way I feel about it. Yeah That's what I thought every year you know, we'll have like a on account or we'll mark it on account There he's gonna know about it, but nevertheless we'll accomplish what we need to do for three four five days Whatever mistakes and send him back a few years well send him back Into the story right exactly okay.

I like what he said that like poison. Which he stole from me. But nevertheless that's good because we want to understand how you feel. But he's with him on his. Okay. And as opposed to that Gerald Solomon. I'm telling you this man, you could see the form in his mouth. It was a frothing out of control. And then they brought on some democratic congressmen who I never even heard of before. And he just ripped him and asked. It was great. He said, Gerald Solomon is known for our wages comments and for being a jackass basically is what he said. He said he's an asshole. What he said. But he said in this particular case, it is so irresponsible and unbelievable. In fact, even Bernie Shaw was hyperventilating on CNN. He said, you mean to say, Congressman Solomon, that you're standing there and you're willing to call the president, the you're risking the lives of our military etcetera and questioning it as he said, yes. When I thought Bernie Shaw was going to take off the headphones and just going to run right down there himself and beat the crap out of this stock. Because Bernie Shaw don't take any crap from anybody. He is one mean mother. It's not something that's in his vocabulary. Must he dish him it out? Well, I sure I really I really joined for the days when he used to have the back calls on the big dish for CNN. And you could see the stuff behind the scenes when they were feeding stuff because Bernie Shaw, man, he is a mean mean, mean spirited nasty mother. He is. I remember one time that we're doing a newscast and to get there, we're getting ready to set up the Larry King shall I guess at that time was in the same studio and they were getting ready to bring the guest in and Bernie Shaw says, well, tell him somebody's doing a goddamn newscast in here right now. Okay, they can wait out there until we're done with this effing up. Who is beautiful? Nice going, Bernie. Our kind of militant spoke. Here's, uh, Western. Hello. Hey, Neil. That's going great. Listen, I don't like putting much either, but he's, uh, I think, uh, going in the right direction and he better watch out for the French and the Chinese because those, you know, the French should really be kissing our asses for what we did for him. Right. That's it. You know, I think a champagne by the end. Yeah, they should be kissing our butts, but you know, since they do business with Saddam. Right. That's right. And the Chinese do. And it's the same thing. And it's all money. It's all about money with the French. Well, I think they're two words that might, uh, change their altitude about this. Two words. Your next. I think those two words might change about the year. And the French, they're always, you know, these people, what if he took over Europe? Right. What if he starts sending scuds over there? Exactly. Should they cry and they be crying out for us, just like they did in the 40s. Right. Always whining for us to come and bail out their, uh, their pansy ass, right? All right. And that's one of the call a couple friends do Spag. Yes, sir. Carlos, who's mine. You're a major do Spag. Who's that, too? Okay. See, uh, okay. We have an open line in Broward. Five, six, seven, five, six, six, the in Pomp five, sixy on the mobile one line. By the way, one of our relatives up there. What's your name? Valerie. Thank you, Valerie. Since me, I was, I don't want to do a, do we want to go back on that names thing again? I will do that later on. I just want to read some of these later. Did you look at this list? Oh, boy. Some real names of customers for a company that she worked for. And wait till the year you'll be here in some of these names, man. You are going to freak out. What endowed you're going to be, freaking out. You're going to read your property, Rhonda. Farms, Bob. Farms, Bob, is all over the place. Here's, uh, Miami. Hello. Morning, Neil. Yes, sir. Um, just wanted to say I'm very glad that we decided to wish the air, the air, the a-rads, uh, happy Ramadan American style. Right. And all I could say really is I really hope that this time we do this job right, no pussy for like last time. Right. Because I mean, you know, why is this guy still even there? I mean, what was our place that is a song about? What was it deal? Well, supposedly they say we went in there because he invaded Kuwait and we had to liberate Kuwait and we got them out of Kuwait and then we walked away and we let him start building up all over again. I mean, I still don't understand. Yeah, you can't even call it the Middle East conflict. That was nothing. That was a vacation in the desert, you know? Right. And what's the thought he's called it? Is calling it why? I mean, why does everybody hate bubble so much? I don't understand that. What is bubble? I don't know anybody. Oh, no, but I'm getting a few blow. Well, I think that is good though. I've looked no matter who the president is, they're going to be the best guy than president in the history. They're going to be a lot of people who like him. There'll be a lot of people who hate him. That's just politics or for whatever it is. Maybe they don't like his nose. They do like his complexion. They don't like each of them. Arkansas, maybe their jealousy is getting so much action. Who knows what it is, but the fact that they do hate him and they still approve of this thing. And they're not in bed with treadlock. I think his speaks well. They don't like the fact that he's out of the all at the arena from not being circumcised. Exactly. And they have a pecorino complex. To get a lot of those frogs, a polygizing to Iraq for the American vision. Yeah. Get a lot of that? I mean, what's with you? These are the same people that seek hate Hitler and the uh, right in the award award ceremony. And every air meter or a wrist in the world, and the history mankind find the same haven in France. They go to the French Riviera. They wind them. They die in them. They do business with them. They're their things. That's exactly right. They suck their ass. They are pigs. And don't ever forget it. And probably we'll have a nice holiday. I told you, the French are just disgusting. And in fact, basically the way to deal with the French is you just pretend they don't exist. That's the best deal way to deal with the French. Whether it's French Canadians, whether it's the French in France, you just and believe me, you don't want to go to Paris. Okay. Even even if you like Paris, which I hated it like poison, you know, I feel like I was lying. I hated it. I still wouldn't go there again because I don't want to give them my money. That's basically the bottom line. Even if it was paradise in Paris, which it is not, even if there was really a great place and the people were wonderful, which they are not. Even if they weren't pigs and two-hawler garbage on the streets, which they do, I still wouldn't go there again because I wouldn't give them one dime of my money. They're attitude. They're whole ambiance. They're so nauseating. It's a revolving. And if you think it's just a cliche or something somebody made up about how they hate the Americans, they hate everybody. They hate all the tourists. They won't list a finger. It's only country in Europe. I've ever been in where they don't give a crap from tourists. They won't even acknowledge that you exist. So you know what I say? I'm just what I say. That's what I say. That's right. Try to say it again. Anyway, TV host Radio Yangtze show over J. Ordman's Spanish language radio and TV host Tomas Garcia Fustes at his program, when was the as Miami?

We don't want to see what he said earlier. He's sitting there looking like, huh? Somebody faxes me this thing about Dave Colpay. And who came out of the plums of the 100 years ago. Former NFL player. And I thought today was supposed to be that show. The world of the gay athlete, the last plums of on ESPN. And I'm looking at my newspaper just a moment ago to see what time that's on. I don't think anything about that. At any time, on any channel, anywhere, and no, how and away. So I don't know. Anyway, George Rodriguez has got one version of the story that happened over there. It's a radio a phase. And then Tomas Garcia, a food. They's got another version. And Rodriguez said that when he tried to go in there for one table discussion about that. That hate a thorn, if they had at the ones both who saturdays ago. That they wouldn't let him go in there and they got into a scuffle. And they were going, I can't. I can't come in. Back at each other. You know, as the acuence, then they get a little emotional. And he said the cancellation of a blend was the SMIM. He's got nothing to do with the gay ordinance. And they had a big contract Thompson by the beat, and he said Tomas Garcia, a food they said they called him a matacone. And he is not a matacone. And there is. So more old crazy Cubans again, who just can't get their act together, because they're obsessed with the, oh, and speaking to the matacone, he's by the way, he's a great little, thank you very much by the way for this cute little thing. That somebody sent me in a fax. Two hillbillies riding down the road in a pickup truck down a country road. All of a sudden they happened upon a sheep with his head caught in a wooden fence. The hillbillies pull over the road. And one guy runs over, pulls his pants down and starts doing the sheep. And he's having his funny yelts to his buddy. Hey, you want some of this? So his friend runs up, pulls the sheep out of the fence. Six his head in the front and yelts out. Hell yeah. Okay, where do we go? Must have been in Lutus, must have been in an entry. Here's a P-Rine, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. I met you down at Borders on Kendall when you were there. And I got some of your traits. Thank you. I've been very much great. I have three little things. Okay. First of all, let me say go George Go about the London Cove on the radio. Nice scam, huh? Neil, Neil is ready to go right off the Richter scale. He just sent that elite team in there and do the job this time. That's all I have to say about that. Okay. And I tried to reach you about those names. Let me not just as I've got a couple of names. Before he was born, I guess he inherited the name. Reverend Crooks. He couldn't hook her. Reverend Hoops has met like an oxymoron. Yes. Reset lead not to redundant hamster. Okay.

I'd be like that. How are you doing, Mary? Now is her name, Mary. Christmas or Mary. Christmas. I wonder. We have an open line in date. Five, six, seven. I mean, you know, it's a free country. If you want to name your kids a bunch of grown test names because you're an asshole, this keep in mind. They'll have to put up with it the rest of their lives. They're going to hate you like poison. They're dead line again. Okay. It is the holidays where supposed to like like each other a little bit better this time of year. Or we're finding out there are some people who hate the f***ing off the line of blank like poison. Whatever it is, whether it's bubble, whether it's the parents could give more real crappy name. Just anybody out there on the street who's driving crappy they hate f***ing like poison. And they're proud of it too. Here's a Margie. Hello. Anyhow, are you doing pretty good? I met you last time in my son at the game. Right. Well, not to, but I beat, but I beat. Right. He was great. I told you. And pride that he's got his own show pretty soon. He's getting me a trouble. And anytime when a public came, somebody says about him about Neil, he gets a line with the rectum and my wife's all over me. Anyway, I got a chance to tell him to watch his unbelievable. Don't tell him to watch the rectum. Sorry. Yes, go ahead. To meet Mike Wang. And you're such a super nice guy. Yes, he is. He's a great guy. And one of the all-time best broadcasters and the two baddest team for him is not to join our last night. He's very unique to his other. But he even went to the locker room and got the yogurt to find a fuck for my ass. How do you like that? He was fantastic. Well, that's Mike. He's a great guy. He said you're a super nice guy. You just didn't have a chance to get with the ass. No, no, I know he wouldn't have come up with. Because now the broadcast guys are way to hell up there. It takes forever to get out. So I was in the spot all the way down like he used in the older arena. But he's a great guy. It was my friend's first hockey game. So he really got out. Hey, picked a good night, man. We actually showed up last night. Burke played great. And they looked really good. And of course, Ray Whitney gets the winning goal. He's gone. Ray Sweetheart. I'm so really. Thanks, man. Okay, have a great day. Yeah, well, good time was said by all last night. And it's quite a bit technical problems. At least we got him straight not by the time the second period started. And we put that behind us in life. One on, you know, because once you start complaining a little bit too much, then they start calling your heart ass. So if the seat there, two narrow and the whatever else, just get with it. Loose them weight. Open line a day, one in Broward. Five, six, seven, a process. But you guys have to set up fries things like F-14s. And every can sell because it's nighttime over there. But it looks awful. Smokey. We will continue to conduct nations in support of operation, desert bucks. And now we'll consider F-14s F-18s E-8s. Let's see. You know, you don't need to. And, uh, how long does that plan bag that you say the mission will continue? That's our understanding for the White House. Lieutenant Gunner's well. Do you have any indication how much longer this operation will last? Couple of months. Um, I do not, um, we are prepared to carry out any task. We're prepared to do that for whatever length of time is required of it. Yeah. Okay, came in. I don't see there like a couple of cars under road. There, I don't see anything really happening yet. But we're keeping our eye on it, baby. We got our eye peeled. And as soon as the bombs start bursting in air, believe me, you'll hear it. There you go. We won't have no ball games. I'm really curious. I'm wondering, what happened on this station at five o'clock yesterday? Somebody came to me at the game last night told me it's six o'clock. Uh, boog or somebody said, okay, let's just put it in a clinical speaking. They said, okay, let's go and the president's speaking. I'll dressing the nation about the attack and our Iraq. And we had some sports thing that got on by mistake for a minute or so. Hey, listen, we don't like pre-empting the scores and the odds on this station. Okay, it takes a hell of a lot for us to say if they were dropping nuclear weapons up in Miramar. We'd still be telling you, hey, don't forget that big game on it. I'd be, maybe that's the most important crap. So I'm kind of curious what was going on here yesterday. About five o'clock when we were dropping the bombs and everybody in the world was sitting there with her eyes glued just a trans fiction from their TV set. And I noticed we had a good crowd last night of our 18,000 people, but boy, that they show up late last night and the reason probably being that most people including me stayed home like a little extra later than usual because we wanted to soak it in. We were sitting there in front of the TV set going. Yeah, like that. That's right. In fact, most of the people last night were going. On the way out of the arena including that kind of front of us. And we just packed it up as a post. Two open lines in date, five six seven, five sixty, pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line. We got Hank coming along with two. We got the books to resist. We got Eddie K with the GAsio, a 10 o'clock tonight. You want to put a good stoking up your post during these holidays, you know, during a holiday time. You know, not only gives nice gifts to other people, but treats yourself a little bit. That's right. Give yourself a treat from our friends in mix. Go down there and pick up some of the best cigars you've ever had in your life. Or as a holiday gift, well, I can't think of too many things that most people would enjoy better. Most guys that like a good stoking, a big box from mixed cigars. They make the best cigars in the universe, the largest manufacturer of premium hand rolled cigar. The entire country, a third generation of premiums of craftsmanship that they've been doing this for about 20 30 million years. They really know how to make a pleasurable great cigar. And they'll give you a little guided tour of the place. If you want, when you go in there and show you all the work and care that goes into making each and every stoking that you pop in your post.

So this year for the holidays, put some serious pleasure in your post or somebody else's from next to guard. And a lot of the little ones you have to make makes sense. She goes down and gets an event. A planet where eight people also men. Car theft is on the rocks. America, a car is stolen every 12 seconds. What can you do to protect your car? An expensive car alarms system will protect your car from being stolen. The car will protect the valuables inside your car. But a big black guy named Ben Chan. You'd a way from the car, mother fucker. For less than you pay for an expensive car alarm system, and even less than you pay for the club, you can get a big black guy named Ben to protect your automobile. You'd a way from the car, mother fucker. It's simple to use. Just leave the big black guy named Ben in your car whenever you get out. And he does the rest. Whenever anyone gets within six feet of your car, Ben simply gets out of the car and tells them. You'd a way from the car, mother fucker. Listen to these testimonials from people who use a big black guy named Ben. It's always nice to have someone to ride with, although it really doesn't say much. Just leave the way from the car, mother fucker. That's about it. I didn't get a big black guy named Ben to chat with. It got into protect my car. This is the best investment I've ever made. My name is it isn't that great. There have been a lot of car thefts. I can't tell you how many times I've figured it away from the car, mother fucker. Knowing that I've got a big black guy named Ben protecting my car. Let's do sleep better at night. Call now 1-800-1 big guy. That's 1-800-1-B-I-G-G-U-I. And instead of hearing this, you'll hear this. You'd a word from the car, mother fucker. 11-14 at 5-60WQ and one other little note on life-myped event at the McAureena. And I don't want to say that the director of operations are robbers and charge to the technical machinations of their auto-guit as fast-pired. But they're showing my good friend Randy Moore doing his pre-game preview of the game. And all of a sudden, I noticed that it seems very familiar like from a week ago. The auto-game, and he's talking about the keys to the game. We have to stop the election action and the auto with this. The only problem is auto-gain was last week. We're playing the Pittsburgh last night. And all of a sudden, like in the middle, if somebody realized that, it's just kind of faded away and disappeared. And I'm thinking, geez, another great start there, boys. Can they get anything right over there? Can they fix the escalators in last week? Okay, well, we need the exercise, walk it up and down. We can handle it. But I mean, if you're going to build an escalator, it was not the old saying, build an escalator and they will come. Does it work? No. But at any rate, see your nithpicking again, you're a bastard. I know it. Bob Hope gets lumped in New Yorker article. Oh man, who never told a funny line in his life. Another man who's like, oh, and by the way, don't tell Greg Kotis, but he's going to die someday. Just like Joe Domansio, Bob Hope will die. He's only 95. That's all about Bob. Living legend Bob Hope 95 last May gets, uh, his lumps from a host of associates and then New Yorker, peacefully December 21 issue, ex-manager Elliott Kozak calls him the most self-centered person he is ever known. Publicist to 41 years Frank Lieberman says he never walked past the mirror without looking at himself or smoothing his hair. And Melville Shavelson, who directed him in several movies, has hoped to make the key to the director's apartment for a twist and paid his writers by gathering them at the bottom of the stairs and sailing their checks twisted into paper airplanes at them. Dr. Linda Hope says, I don't feel that I really know him. That's a kind of sadness for me because I would have liked to know him better. Kozak says Hope's life was 64 years the lowest long for romance from this man and he was cold as ice-tour. The lowest addressing for husband's woman, I was in says, it never bothered me. I thought I was better looking than anybody else. Whatever that means. So there you go, Bob Hope, what they're saying about him? He's an asshole. A lot of walking around baby, a lot of assholes out there in the streets of America. On the streets of this little globe. Not too many walking around on the streets of Baghdad right now. All right.

Okay, all right I am by choice the Catholic and that's okay Everyone's entitled to believe in what they want to believe in All right, isn't there and correct me some wrong in in the country? Those are the way the larger written there's a separation of church and state for for for business sense and for religious purpose Every and these these questions I'm gonna post you are just rhetorical because this is something A life when I talk about it's just got me cheesed off. Yeah everything that we have warranty was everything that we buy Has this claim was in it and everything Active God exactly now if you're you being alive.

God through the name exactly and the other thing you I'll stick my hand on the Bible and tell you whatever you want to hear anything you like and any time that you write the date And this again It has nothing that it's not a conflict with religious belief But it's something that's ingrained or that just people do is that it's an automatic thing anytime that you write the date 1998 is saying that you believe it 199 years ago Christ was born I mean actually that is that's an autonomy And that's what that represents and people Domino is the biscuits absolutely Uh-huh That's what that that's what that symbol I don't think that don't get all of that out of here just remember one thing There's no fact in the church.

First time caller, while time listener, moved to your Bob 5 years ago from Pittsburgh. From Pittsburgh, bad game last night, sir. Look at you. Pretty stale. One half, and I was reading a paper about the thing was, how would they go bankrupt? Like, yeah, leave it all that money. Well, you know, when you're peeing, I'm very all-admoney and you're paying y'all who are all that money. And when you're not drawing, really as many people as you claim that you are. And when you don't have like the big revenues coming in because Pittsburgh is a small market, they don't have all the big TV and radio rights that they do in New York and a lot of the major markets. And as a result, they look at the pirates. It's a Pittsburgh thing. It happens that would regularly, because it's a small market trying to be major market and they're just not making it. And that has to be one of the oldest stadiums to the Civic Arena. And they'll all go, they'll all go. And don't forget, these four mario came along. The penguins almost went bankrupt then. They almost had a movie leave town. It came within a whisker. Right. Okay, that's all I got. Love you. Okay, good luck, you pal. And the Marty Strucker's God. He's playing great ballads today. Marty Strucker's playing the best hockey in his life. And two bad Doug McLean didn't like him. We might still have him on the team here, God damn it. 15 goals. Nice going, Marty. Skating like the wind. Oh, and by the way, I do want to say this, which will make the organization happy. This kid that they brought up with those names named Radotak, Rad Chuck. This dude of judgment. This kid look great last night. He's skating like the wind. Nice going, Arada. Tack. Look pretty good.

As we're Chris is standing by waiting for more donations. Waiting to sell more of our best of stuff. Waiting to get laid and whatever else. Chevron station on the northwest corner of US one. And Helen deal beats full of art. So if there anybody among those torques that we have over the other building. Who is actually getting laid every now and then. They just talk about it a lot. Because I hear it awful lot of conversation all the never ending. And stuff about guilty guilty is like I'm constantly here. And how do you get laid when you have no equipment? What? You all the is hung like a moose? That's what I hear. Well, how would the people here know if guilty is hung like a moose? Unless they've seen it. On a sports station and you're telling me that we have guys in his building. Who have seen guilty's penis? Or I didn't say the guy's told me. Well, I said I'm restraining myself. So desperately right now. We have an open line of day five six seven. Oh five sixty and five sixty on the AT and T wireless line. Here's Miami. Hello. Okay. Thank you. There's the awardee board is doing it hovering over it. Here's an immobile and the old baby. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes sir. Well, I got to give you credit. You sure they call like stalker thing a few years back. Yeah. You love the guy and you were talking them up so much and he's turned out to be. How could you not see it? Every every shift every time you went out there on the ice. Like making things happening five he escaped like the low the wind and it and the game two nights ago when he Be just barely beat Tampa Bay. Yeah. And then the game last night. He's playing the best of his career right now. He's making moves. He picked Carcness Pocket last night with the score that goal. And by the way, Carcness played a great game other than that last night for the first time a long time. Nice going. Terri is about time. But I'm telling you this kid is playing so great. Yeah. Did you see Eddie Jote almost take Barnes and that off? Yeah. Yeah. That was a smart play by the way. I got a special hand. He was a genius. He's a rocket scientist. All the all say this and all fairness. He was flying last night. They all were. They all played a pretty good game. Yeah. Including our buddy showing work. Yeah. Sean played. I tell you once every six weeks he'll play a game like that. The rest of the time he'll take the joint out. But once every few weeks, when he least expected. So we're because he's capable of doing that. But he just he's just doing consistent. He looked good. He just looked quicker last night. More on top of him. Yeah. He was great last night. The rest of the barash was great too. Well, you know, they gave barash those number two star. Yeah. I didn't think that. You know, they gave me one of the three in a game. Of course, Sean Burke won. What do you mean, Melon B3? What about Whitney that scored the right? I thought it would be what it would have been. How could it not be a little right? Whitney that scored the winning goal. I thought of these people out of their mind. Really? Maybe. Yeah. Well, the empty net or I mean, yeah. Billy is the recipient of two nice to holiday gift early. He got an ice gift from Eric Weinrich. Formerly of the black ox, which I think was his ticket out. But he got that gift goal. I won the two to one Chicago game here a few weeks ago. I've got a nice gift for them. I'm talking a Pittsburgh defense is so bad. They got, you know, a lot of great offensive players, not just Yager and Barnes and Strocker, but they got your Montetoff and they got Kovalev who served to be fighting himself there and playing real good. They got tremendous offense before their defense is really shaky. Doctors, bigger than I thought he was. He could be the strongest player in the league even stronger than Linda Russ. He's not as big as him, but he is as strong as an ox. Do you see how he escaped in on the goal? I mean, he's almost unstoppable. Yeah. And keep in mind that we weren't playing all that good last night either. Yeah, I agree. I agree. Thanks, Theo. Okay, I have a great day. Marty, Strocker, God, we missed you, Marty. Well, man, why we talked hockey for 20 seconds. I turned to mind is one call left in the board. Well, excuse us, okay. Excuse us. How about those leaves? First time Phoenix, give it up five goals all year. They'll leave down two nothing to Phoenix at the end of one of Maple Leaf Gardens. Pat Quinn takes him in the room at the end of the period says, hey, you forgot guys. These guys, this team is in a Western conference. Oh, yeah, we're supposed to beat them and they did four goals in four minutes. Nice goal and goal leaves goal, baby. Oh, all these pudwackers down here. All they got to do is think hog. Yeah, they leave after the second period, like I said, they don't give a crap. 1036. 1036, well, what kind of time is that? Oh, that's when we're dropping more bombs. 1036. Well, that's pretty damn woo. 1036. 1036, little Marty. Huh? Nice lady came by and dropped 100 bucks. Thank you, sweetheart. Let's see, eight, three. It's 100,000, three, every 82 bucks. We're going to keep that. We're going to keep gushing that total up by and spiderweb as going on out there. Open line and Broward, all three in day. They just dropped off the map. Just like Baghdad's going to do over the weekend. They just dropped off the map. 567560, 560, on the AT&T wireless line. Here's Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes, sir. Talk about hockey and last night. Uh-huh. Aaron Brignell needs to go. Why is that? He has sung every night. You know, the National Anthem? What do you mean by that? Same guy, every... Well, of course. And most places have the same guy who's seen it. No, no. That's a mighty, really. Great. Aaron Brignell is God. I love Aaron Brignell. No, no, no. At the Miami Arena, it was a different guy every night. But the nuts were at the end though. He became the regular. They were searching. I mean, what do you want? You want Richard Freeman back? Oh, I don't hear you. Somebody knew him. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. They must go, right. And by the way, they still haven't picked the red lights. We still can't see it from where we sit. But I'm just giving up at this point. I don't care anymore. You're a royal. Yeah. I think I do the Hopey Scratch last night. Right. And people like to have red lights are considered. I don't give a sh**. No, I'm just giving up. They don't care about the fans so screw it. Ratch, check? Yeah. Good. And have a nice day. Okay. We have an open line in Dr. Howard Alphry and day. Five, six, seven, five, six, six, five, six, six. On the AT&T Wireless Line, yes. Ten, if he's six, and Aaron Brignell is Wayne Huzzing is cousin. And I still like. A minor carepiece is cousin if he's kissing, doesn't that? What he is? He's good. Okay. So he booched your up, oh, Canada, a few weeks ago when Otto was here last week, he did a good job. I like how could you look? You people are so freaking negative. How could you be knocking the guy that sings the National Anthem? And I will confess that to not last night. What was the game before that? Who the hell did we play? What was it? But whatever it was. I guess it was the Otto again. And he sang the American National Anthem. He got like a off. He was the he was lost a little bit. He needed a roadmap. I like Aaron Brignell. I don't care if he's his cousin. If he's his nephew. If he's his brother or law. If he's his sister or law. I like Aaron Brignell. I think he did. And it's good having the same brother. I like that guy they had in Boston for years. Renee, what does they ran court? And that Renee like how did he? What about how his name was in Montreal? I spit a frog that's been there for 2,000 years. I like that. And it's been having some goofball come down there that makes it into what ten minutes. I hate those people. They make the National Anthem into a ten minute exercise. And every note has got to be a long drawn up. Like a Jose Feliziano thing. Although I didn't like Jose Feliziano. I love that. That was good. That was 100 years ago, but it was good. And he was saying, oh, is that can you see? And he said no. And that was bad. Well, he started out and saying, oh, say can you see? No. But he's still saying it good. Here's Papino. Hello. No. Yes sir. How's it going? Great. Is it me? Yes. For him I have these things been around for a while that. The Christian fish on the car. Oh, it's been around for a while. Oh, it's been around for a while. But now, it's not. Now, it's not. Now, it's one where they have a big, uh, your filter fish. They have a big Christian fish that says true done it. Yeah. And swimming into the mouth of the big Christian fish. Yeah. Mollipish that says Darwin on it. Oh, it's not cute. Oh. They got you. I got prepared that we talk science, man. I think they just find another, uh, a fossil here. I think it was a hell of a nail. They found a fossil. But sure if they just found another one that goes back 20, uh, 30 years or whatever it held it. Oh, no, the earth's only been here 6,000 years right. We believe you. So for all of the people. Yeah. But that's just another county plot. All that science will grab it. And 80 is heat and plot. For all the nine sounds for the land stands. I've got to cut it up for you, Neil. Yeah. You're original. Oh, great. I'd like to hear that. But as I, as I leave you for the holidays, I'd like to say one thing. Yes. Exercise, like money. It puts the loft in the casket. Hold on. Yeah. That's what the Governor pumpkin shot. How do you get up? Anyway. We're listening. Okay. Okay. Good early here. I put you did say. It works the lotion in the basket. And she said, boy, this is the pit. Yeah. That's what you're going to get. This is the pit. And he still said it puts the lotion in the basket. Open line at Broward 2 and day 5, 6705, 60, 560 on the AT&T wireless line. It's 125 if you weigh in the price. Is that thing real? Govie. Govie. Govie. Talk it on a board show. Try and do the macho. Your boy sounds just like a desert ear, older. A little sport show. What else are you careful? Govie. Govie. Govie. Talk it like a baby. Govie's a little traini. Like a little on the first hand. You don't have like a plan. We both know well about that show. Your throat sounds healthy. Stepping. Stepping. Govie. Your lucky management doesn't have the healthy. You don't belong there on the air. And slowly. So sport can wait till your voice cracked. Of any one who sounds like that should find another job. And say you only take you back when both your baby's dropped. Govie. Govie. Govie. When you're gone to grow up. Give me that one to grow up. You silly, sweet, cool. Govie brought tattling to your free new sexist boy. Thank you. Now die, die, die. You're a hot. You're a hot. You're a hot. You're a hot. You're a hot. You're a hot. You're a hot. Wow. So maybe jelly really is the middle and rural sports radio. And we're not just bluffing. Maybe that's how we got to job. I think that's how we got to job. Pong like a mousse huh? Okay. We have two open lines in date. Five six seven, five six and five six. The on the 18th. He wireless fun. Maybe that's why neither baby ever drop. He's got the high squeaky voice. Maybe there just wasn't any room. Okay. Where we going? Here's Pepper Pine. Hello. Okay sir. I got to talk about early. You know, the question fish. How old for DNA to be start clicking the fish stick on there? On the back of our cars. Okay. That sounds good or no. After we eat it or before. Well, we can put like maybe just the chalk the park because we don't need that. You know, that's too. That's too much for. Yeah. Fish we buy some. Okay. Okay. First of the next thing. I think I think that's done. Scoreboard. No. I mean really. It is absolutely ridiculous. I'm trying desperately to enhance my enjoyment and pretend I'm enjoying having a good time going there. After they got it fixed in the second period after the first two embarrassing penalties where the penalty clock was morning. After the second period everything worked flawlessly and they even last night got the out of town scores up there with great regularity in the corners like they did for the first game or two and then they kind of forgot about it. And that was great. I mean, how difficult is that to do? That was dynamite. Well, you know, you know, you know, best they've seen the leaves still on away from Phoenix was great. We don't have some believers that, you know, I go to the sign of games there and there's no problem with the scoreboard at all. Yeah. And nothing whatsoever. I don't know. I think it's the director of operations at the hockey games. I think there's the trigger when the wood pile of the players are actually really is. Yeah. Anyway, so yeah, we're good game. I signed you up for the scoreboard part. And one request. Yes, sir. Can you play it? I don't know. You might play it earlier. Can you play it on my rack song? The one? The bomb on a rack. Okay. Sure. I'm wondering if the very early we'll play it again and again and again again. I'll keep dropping money. Okay. We have an open line at Broward 2 and day. They counted kind of like faded away after we found out that we couldn't raise any money in day. No, seriously. We've had a move primarily in day county. Although we'll admit that there was a yesterday where it's a pizza locked in there. In day he behind the pirouan imports and absolutely laid a big, even the Iraqis haven't seen a bomb like that recently. So we've had a move right now because we have pockets of audience. Okay. We've got a little pocket over here, a little pocket over there. And the rest of the people are hands around their pockets and they're feeling the change. But if they're not listening to this show or they're just not going to help us out. They may be listening, but they're a bunch of cheap asses. Even in a hell in the Alfaqran, I love we've got 1146 bucks. We're granted over a hundred thousand four hundred and twenty five dollars. All I can say is, thank you all very much. You've been great. We really, this thing just took off like a like wildfire the last week. Didn't let them this thing take off just shockingly. Here's David. Hello. Hey, I'll come to the Alpechanuka. And back to you. You know, somebody must be trying to drive us crazy, putting guilty on the radio. I mean, just happen to listen to that. Oh, Disney character boy. I just can't take it. It's unbelievable. But the voice is bad enough, but the ass sucking torpedoes that comes out of it, that only magnifies it like 10 million times. It's a totally different than I thought he would. I saw him on one of those Panther pre-game things on TV. Yeah, he didn't. I watched one. He looks like a punk, you know, just like an ordinary punk. I know what you mean. Right. You know, how about with a very large penis? Oh, unbelievable. You were talking about the name. Get teal is pretty pretty high up on that list. And then that goes another guy on the same. His name is La Roy, LA, apostrophe, ROI. Was an apostrophe, all right. That's a touch of class when you've been putting the apostrophe in it. I'll really, really, it's a love Roy. Yeah. I've got that one. And then there's just plain, roll. Don't forget him. Plano, La Roy. Right. I thought, I was thinking, you know, if the Clinton was a Republican, I think the Democrats would be doing the same thing. I mean, it's just a game. And they just go back and forth. And did anybody, Well, I think you're missing the point. That is the Republican Party has now been taken over by right wing radical lunatic, phonetical phony Christian, and that's the reason this is going on. You don't think the Republican Party is going a little more moderate. The Republican Party is going, oh my god, you got to be smart. You just belong to the magic mushroom. You're hanging around with roll. You're something. Wow. You might be inhaling somebody else's bad weed. I used to, I don't do that anymore, but yeah. Just for good stuff now.

Why did we win though? Yeah, hockey game last night. Why did we play so well? Because Andy from Hollywood stayed the hell away. For me anyway. So here's the fact, not leave. Well, not one to leave well enough alone. Here's the fact that says, as you know, I did not come down to see you yesterday. I do know that. But that was hit by myself. Yeah. I'm having a good time already. My girlfriend sent you. Did not want to go down because she is now scared. I think what he's trying to say is sent he's got more comments since that he does, which goes without saying. We would like to come down and give you a gift. Can we? Andy and Hollywood. P.S. I still love you. Well, how can I simply address that? Can we? No. Yeah, I think that takes care of it. Can we come in the? No. No. Can we give you a? No. Would you like to see it? No. I'll talk to Cynthia. I'm no problem with Cynthia because she's not a pain in the ass. She doesn't bother me. She's not a pest. She doesn't send me stupid idiotic crashes. Only one time. So the answer is very simply Andy is. No way Jose. God. One of the game last night because he stayed the hell away. That's the lucky the unlucky term. 5 6 7 0 5 60 pump 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line. Watching the night scope image. There's still traffic over there and bag that God damn it. There's still a lot of me had driving around. Which we're not too happy about that. You notice this time they left all the electricity on. Because they didn't want the hospitals. They didn't want the electricity in the baby milk factory going out. But you know, Peter R. I'm not sure if you go over there and start crying for all the companies. What is it? 1246. Well, so what's he complaining about for Christ 6 100,000 5 45. We're kicking ass in hell and they'll baby. Oh, wow.

I'm a bum fore place. Some growth test place that he said. Oh, North Miami Beach. I told him it's a game last night. I said forget North Miami Beach. It's not there anymore. It doesn't exist anymore. Chris. Yeah. I thought you had something important. You were looking at there that you were going to show us. What is it? Can you read it from here? It says Peter Bulger is a bumper sticker. Not see? Well, why didn't they have to say bumper sticker in there? Peter Bulger who looks just like that, Torp from the congressman from Florida, the wall with the glasses in the ball head. Oh, God. Every time I see him, I get pains in my back. I get sharp knifeing pains in my back. Here's Miami Lakes. Hello. Hey, how are you? Okay, sir. I just wanted to mention to you that my office staff along with myself are really impressed with all the work you've done with the Center 1. And I took the time to make a collection around my company. And we would like to make a donation, you know, Center 1. And I would like to have it, you know, the address of work and I send it in there. Okay. I'm George of a Logivity in the address too. By the way, I forgot to mention this today. When he will broadcast Marlins game. Oh, court channel 33 days to have the heat and even though there was no basketball season, did they have the heat anymore? No. So, when they desperate to find something to put on it, and my convenience besides mash and K-Poffa USA and the some other old stupid reruns like the monsters, when he will broadcast Marlins games and other big winner know that. They'll broadcast 50 to 55 Marlins games per season in association with sports center, or of course, the broadcast the other games. Does anybody care about either situation? No, of course not. There you go. They're given the Wandy. So, channel 33. I guess all their luck with those was it. You p.n. whatever whichever one of the Warner Brothers I can't figure it up is there a bunch of old crappy reruns. bunch of those syndicated sitcoms and stupid idiotic little kid shows and basically that's it. So, nice going there. Very dealer and many Lush-M. They got the Marlins on there. Good. Here's Oakland Park. Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, sir. You talk about, I just turned it two in your third. Are you talking about bad names, turbo names? That's one of the many, many things that we were at first. I have a two-way. I have a friend. His name is Malik. And Malik putting the Malik. Yeah. Am I name is Sill? It's one. Still. Do you think it's what? Still. It's still. He's telling that you'll never spell it. P.H. Why oh. No. No, see you name pronounce this right. It's S.Y. L.E. S.Y. L.E. Right. Sile. No. Sile. Still. Okay. See you in a while, Sile. Okay. We have an open line in, he thinks his name is Sill, but it's Sile. 560, 560, 560, on the 18th, he wireless line. Here's a mobile and dear field B, Sillow. Sounds like Sile to me. Uh-huh. I got a story story as listening to you the other day when you were first talked about these names and it reminded me of something. How's up there in Boathead? Public side, I don't know, 441 and grade. Yeah. And I'm sitting there and walking down one of the aisles. This is woman and they get a three-year-old child with approximately three years old. And I hear you all out there's a child like Boathead over here. Do you have a naming your daughter now? Maybe I'll clear it. You know, seriously, her name was Boathead? Her name was Boathead. Well, Jesus, what if she would have grown up in Canada, Degua? I don't know. I don't know whether it's potential for Siddhar, maybe a little boat. Uh-huh. What if I got grown up in Hoboken, over to the occult or Hobo? Hey, don't call me a Hobo. Hobo. Boathead. Can you believe that? This is the point I'm trying to make. I mean, your name is whatever your parents are stuck with. Okay, but what's wrong with these parents? And it goes to show you, like I've said before, forced sterilization, man. Oh, the only hope for the future of America forced sterilization. We have dumb people making babies. And then naming those poor babies names that's going to make them neurotic, even if they had a chance to begin with to be like functioning, living and breathing human beings. Now do they have any chance? Oh, none. Because they're going to go through their entire lives with these horrendous hang-ups and complexes. About their idiotic names, which I threw that thing in the waste basket. And then we go here it is. I mean, what a bunch of it. Here's O' Ayana. And Star Alicia. How you doing, Star Alicia? And Tamika. My favorite door is Laquisha. How about Dr. Pepper? We're not against? Hey Doc, how about if your life name was Pepper? How about Doc? Oh, it's the Doctor. It's just a very sad thing because they don't consider the way they're going to be. They don't consider the consequences. Mary, John, Jose, Juan, Tom, Ted. That's it. Don't you think? It's like, I think what we ought to have instead of people changing their names to these Tony Muslim names and all these other fully-belowning names like Neurodges. I mean, come up with like, let's go the other direction. Let's have Tau Anika, whatever, how short. Change her name back to Sally Smith. That would be great. Oh, I heard what's a thank you. Thank you. I've got bless you for least having a name that we can pronounce. We don't have to spend like half of our time together. Singering out what you're name be. Much less to go to how do you be spelling it? Eight minutes. In fact, how much does anybody have a chance of learning how to spell if I can't even know a spell or a guy named name right? No. Eight minutes till two or five. Just give me a few.
