Carpay to the papers this morning, trademark litigate loses and wins. That's right, Howard jury in a very peculiar thing. They gave Carmax $50 million and said, well, even if you didn't really actually steal her a name, never to less, so you still have to pay $50 million. So, Republic of Stalk is down there in the crapper in the toilet. I'm gonna have to cough up $50 million if they go to a toilet, and who knows what's gonna happen. But nevertheless, we like it. It's a good omen. So anyway, Susan this morning calls in on a worse team. One of the very few calls. And Susan says, what are these rumors I'm hearing about you guys going up? Keep, I want you to follow the logic of this, okay? The rumors I'm hearing about you guys going off here on this morning's show, because if I listen along time and I love you guys, no matter what my listen, about to beat, not to blow, but to my, and of course, I never listen to the rest of the stuff. Certainly, those are what listen to the hands. And I wouldn't listen to that, that what's his name? What's his name? How do you like that? What's his name? So again, like I told you many times before, with some of these sports nerds, I don't even have a name. I'd like Greg China. I'm like Greg Effing China, baby. I don't have a name. We're gonna have America record a new song, a host with new names. With no name. What's wrong with that? In fact, there's what there's one for Boker Bryant, a host with no name. So the tune of a horse with no name? Great song, by the way. Whatever happened to America. Oh, yeah, a lot of people were asking that question. In fact, if you try to watch the TV show on WAM, you're probably asking, whatever happened to America. Whatever happened at the days we could turn on our TV set, and expect to be able to see and hear whatever the program was on a year. I could easily do the rest of the four hours, which would be another waste of my time, because nobody's watching anyway. And if you wonder why nobody's watching, one of the reasons is, probably these days, the main reason is, because they can't hear it. I flip over there at 10.30 last night after watching the Leafs play, I call them again, get pounded by Pittsburgh, or anything, which again could have been 10 up and forward per Kojo, but nevertheless, I flip over there to it. Well, I watched the show tonight. See what they do. If I got the chicken on my head, if I got the propeller beanie on my head, which I had both. And it was a pretty entertaining show. If you could hear the sound. And again, it's, Hey, I did it. And then, of course, when you turn the volume up, the hum. Like I've told you before, even Monica never perfected the old hum job, like they had it when he meant. The hum gets louder and louder and louder, to the point where I was in the first 30 seconds, they know that anybody nearby mind's going to shut it off. And the interesting part of this whole deal is that there's still when the spots in the promos come on after the segments of the show, the audio is perfect. No problem whatsoever. The problem being that the handful of sponsors that they have on there who are still crazy enough to be bought spots on that show, they're being sucked into violence of eye advertising on a show that nobody could watch if they wanted to what, because you can't hear the sound. So, you know, I, what, what can I say? I mean, I've said it a million times before. I can't say if you're in accuse anybody of deliberately sabotaging, but it's got to be one of two things, either the most in it because the finished product that they sent over there from here is perfect. The video is perfect. The audio is perfect. There are no problems on a product leaving this building going over Lincoln Road, but somewhere in the transition, with all that multi-million dollar digital equipment they got to stay in the art over there, and they can't get the sound on here. Only between 1030 and 1100 o'clock at night for Neil at night. They can't get the sound on here. Is there a problem with the sound on sports town? No, with the, with the, with the, with the, Kepasa USA? No, with the, generation NIA, and he problem there with the sound? No. But when we got Neil at night on air for some bizarre peculiar reason, we can't hear the goddamn show. So like I said, it's either got a video. It's a bit of a bit of a negative attitude, or it's got to be that somebody over there don't like me. Do you want to think that's possible, do you? Uh-huh. Because it's interesting that this is technically, we had back at a beginning of the technical, which is on all the shows, like, but I never disappoint. Air every night you get that big hum job or you want it or not, which, hey, that's the American way, you know, to go on with that. So I just thought I mentioned that in passing again, just like, LeJay Tosh said in the exercises. I mentioned that only in passing, father paranoia, answer the question. And as far as paranoia is concerned, I'm going to tell you, I could do it in the next 75 hours on the Murrays. Terry Murray and Brian Murray, like I said, it's the same person. There's only one Murray. And the disguise is like Park Kent. You take the glasses off, it's Superman. You put the glasses on, it's Park Kent. You say, stuff like suck at anchets, Terry Murray. You say, shuffering, shuffering, shuffering, shuffering. That's the only difference. It's the same bosom. Nine minutes after ten, five to ten, five to ten, five to ten, five to ten. That's your, you know, shopkeeper, you're a, yeah. Ray, what the hell's up here? It was, I told you. How is Napoleon confident that we know? No, dammit. Ten perteen to five, sixteen, WQM, how are you doing Susan? You know Susan's out there right now. Yeah, I would listen to that, what is name? What is it with a women in this town? Stoppy, nasty. I'm not saying all of them only about 80%. Misurable humorless, obnoxious disgusting. It's a radio show. Okay, it's just a guy named radio show. I wasn't going to say anything. There was a guy at the hockey game the other night at the Friday night game when I was like the big star and I should have been because nothing else was going on. Of the MSGA, nice call there, Chris Moore. And how come so none? Commit a lot of morning show this morning. You know, that's another thing. They also don't admit that they listen to show. And I've been told on very good authority. Default listens to this radio station. That's just this show 24 hours a day. Non stop in his sleep. He's got the headset on. He's listening to Eddie K over night to get the morning line on. I've got them basketball game. Arrow three minutes of the day, he's listening. But somehow they didn't hear the fact we played Chris Dean and Moore. And that cute could embarrassing worse call in a history of sports dancing on Mark Messier six on Rth Gole. So they play the car this morning and then very non-committal I noticed by the way. Not just guilty, but even the other two guys all of a sudden lost both their pair. It was the ball this show on there this morning because nobody ate to go well. That'd be it. But it will be out. They're afraid I guess Chris Dean and Moore's going to show up on that show again. Like he did last this season. And all of a sudden he defaulted everybody else read of course Gellie. You didn't have to be ball hangra somebody beat them to the job, but nevertheless. So at any rate speaking of the Panthers, this is, you know, it's very sad. It's been sold them in my life including last year's future season. Have I seen anything so uninspiring, so disorganized, so embarrassing. And when Terry Murray and you are witness, when he came in here that one day, I met him for the first time. I said on a year, good guy, like him. I went over to the Mac Arena that third time to see the give I guided to her the place of the joint. If I can say that and took me down to the offices, there was Billy Smith, Posh offices sat down, had a little chat with Terry. Good guy. Good guy. I said again, I bought primary dinner that night at the El Molino implantation. Good guy. And I still say good guys, but there's no anything. Are they doing anything that makes any sense? Here we go with the same bull crab. And I'm going to predict it right now. Because I watched that Pittsburgh Leafs game last night. Pittsburgh Tully dominated. It leaves it all due to play a bad game and they did. But Marty Strocker played one hell of a game for the Penguins last night. Kill and penalties. He's out there blocking shots. He was dynamite. Saturday scores two goals in that game had another goal that they thought he had. But the credited to somebody else could add a hat trick in the game. Saturday. Hell of a player. Doug McClain didn't like Marty Strocker. So Doug McClain wouldn't play Marty Strocker. And then every time he did play him, if he didn't score at least ten goals in that game, he'd sit him out again. He made it impossible for him to play on his team. And just about then ended his career until Pittsburgh gave him another chance. I foresee that Terry Maurice got the same deal here with Ray Whitney who beyond any question. Last season, question. There's no debate. Every statistical category goals assist power play goals. You name it. Virtually every category scored the goal. To give the Panthers the win. I'm looking for statistics here. Victor Coslov's got no point in the game. No. No. No. Golly Lindsey. Nice here. No goals. No assists. Minus 3 and a plus and minus. No points. Sit in him. No. I'm going to predict you today right here on a year. That Terry Maurice will do the same thing to Ray Whitney, unfortunately. That Doug McClain did to Marty Strocker. When I took up my paper this morning and read benched Panthers to make return against Red Wings and Robert's fail. He'll be back in line up and Ray Whitney will be back but on the fourth line. On the fourth line. On the Goon line the check-in line with Dwayne and Peter Warrell. I'm saying to myself, this man has got to be crazy. There must be some kind of a thing in that family. You take your hearsay team that can't score. I went and saw two games, two long-pond risk games in three nights. When did I scored one goal, Friday, getting to the season was far away. The worst team in the league to finally fired the Espresidas and getting their act together. Other than scoring four goals in that game, if they scored more than two goals in any other game. No. So they need scoring out there. They need people who can stick to puck and net. That's what the game is all about. Allegedly. Especially when you have mediocre goal-tending which we've got. In spite of the fact we were in that season. I'll be right up. I'll be right up. I'll be right up. I'll be right up. No. Of course not. I'll be right up. But when I see that they're taking the best player from last year. And because maybe he didn't play great on Friday night, but who the hell did. Now let's make an example out of him. It's the spike game all over again. That's what we're going to do for some reason. I don't know what to deal is. Robbie Neetermeyer, who must have naked pictures of the Murray Brothers doing each other with a goat in the middle. It's got to be it. That's it. Rob Neetermeyer must have pictures of Brian and Terry Murray doing it with a goat. Do it a three way. Gotta be. Let's take a look at his statistics. Six games, no goals. One assist, minus one plus and minus. And the assist again, like I said, coslost standing all alone in front of it. My grandmother could made that pass. To set up that goal. Even though the announcer is trying to make a big head. Robbie Neetermeyer. Yeah. He sucks. He can't get the job done. He's at a disgrace. He's a highest pay player on the team. No. He's skating well. He's doing it like a loss. He's like a lost puppy out there. And has been this is a 30 year in a row. Did they try to get rid of him? No. They desperate was Brian Murray psychotic over the fact that Mike Smith and Toronto didn't make the deal. And that we didn't get Felix Pipeman was Brian Murray psychotic about that. You bet, cos I was there that he was talking about it. He was pissed off, baby. He was a little bit scared of the coach Terry Murray quoted in the paper a couple of days ago. If it takes Robbie 20 games to get his act together, he'll be in there every day. And we just keep putting them out there and plugging away. But the guy who produced a best a pleasant surprise a miracle for his last year. And by the way, how many of those goals run to powerplay. And this coach decides, well, he don't want him to play the point on the powerplay. Because he's too small. He's too little. It's part of the fact that all the goals he scored last year at a powerplay was planned to point on the powerplay. We got a coach who knows better from everybody, but I get the feeling he doesn't know what he's thinking about this team that he inherited. How could he not know he was the coach of the flyers early in the season until he got his ass kind over there. He was the coach in Philadelphia. They played us many times. He should have some idea who can do it on this team and who can't. In addition to which when your brother is the general manager in coach of the team, most of the last season, don't you think you've come over here and have some idea of who the guys are that can produce for you and who the guys are that are going through the motions. We're doing the S.A.T.K. in the Moosee skating routine that's centralized, skating figure rates, auditioning for the Olympic winner skating, give me a freaking break with your Terry Murray. Here we go again. Build up a nice $183 million arena with problems which we've talked about to Lumblul in a face. I'm trying to get them all straight and out for you. So far doing a pretty damn good job if I say so myself. But like I said the other day, now all we need is a team to play in that arena. That's what we need. And we got all these other guys that were desperate to get rid of that note that nobody else would take. Please take them. Just we don't want anything of return. Just take them and pay them their salary and we don't want to receive them again. We got like six or seven of those guys. But here we go. Bryan Murray takes the top score. That would be like Matt Sundeen plays a bad guy for the Maple Leafs. plays a bad game which he hasn't so far by the way. But he will. Does stuff here everybody else does. And Pat Quincy is hey Matt, you're sitting out the game. What next game. And then you're going to come back. We're going to put you on a check in line with Chris King and Ty Domey. Hey, is that they would run them out of town on a rail in Toronto. They'd say if you lost and I'm not saying that Ray Whitney is Matt Sundeen. But I'm just using examples. Who was the best player on whatever team it is last season? And this is what we get. This is what you pay their fifty seven bucks or whatever it is. Every guy's in game and you're ten dollars to park and you're twenty dollars for a food or forty dollars for a food for a got a family more than one. So that we can go out there and see a bunch of again. And I'll be there tomorrow night. And I'm going to tell you, I may not be here if there's the or Friday because I may have your tea. I'll have Larry and Jydus. Because my seats this year are instead of behind a penalty box. And this is what the guy in the house is like they used to be the other joint there behind the bench and even though I'm 16 rows away. I'm going to be screaming, I guide them. Longs out at Terry F. and Murray is what I'm going to be doing because you're a pose out Terry. You're just like your brother in drag. You're a shyppleton. At least put the guys out there who can produce for you pay their guts out. Can anybody accuse Ray Whitney and not give it a hundred percent ever in any game since he's been on it. game since he's been on his team. Oh, first night. But we get treated to the same guys who just the no can do guys night after night after night and we go out there last week. I could have read, you know, these two books I wish I would have bought them a few days earlier. I could have polished one book off their Wednesday night and the other one on Friday night. I could have been through both of those great books because I sure wouldn't have missed anything out there on the ice. Same old crap that we get treated to here in this town. So it's one thing to be a nice guy. It's another thing to have some idea what you're doing. How about Bench and Robby Needemar? How about sitting in his big stupid medicine hat asked down on the down in a suit in the stand somewhere? Oh, and by the way, I just mentioned in passing like Lijay Cobb. I just mentioned in passing. Also, when it's one of the same articles by Mark and you notice the columnist, the writers in this town, they have nothing to say about this. They have no opinion. They just print whatever they Tom to print. Unlike in a real sports town where every column has got opinions in it. Senator Chris Wells has in place since March 26th and won for nine to 11 more weeks. Wells underwent surgery Friday to repair a three-inch muscle tear in his abdomen. This is the same guy that Brian Marie told us he'd rather have Chris Wells after he made that awful trait than Doug wait of the Edmonton Oilers who just signed a two-year contract for almost six million dollars. One of the best young players in the league who hasn't played a game for us since March 26th and even when he was playing couldn't do the job. They just keep lying and lying and lying and BS and you get wane with a Marlon song in a dance and they expect you to come out and pay a lot of money for that. Which by the way, I noticed after Hank said the story straight yesterday, very jackass this morning suddenly decided to hero. Oh, maybe the deal I could have go through who knows with John Henry. What a place. What a town. 1027 and 560 WQM also. For you. All right. Thank you Joe Rose aka Dwayne Stomp. Nice going. That was kind of like the end of our TV show last night. I guess they figured nobody could hear it anyway. So they just chopped up the end of it was like one minute. I'm with the beanie on the next minute. I'm not. It was like a chop liver basically. 1032 and 560 WQM don't forget our center one parents this Saturday have been in Jerry's Neventure from noon to two. Evan. I'm telling you whatever they're drilling. Whatever construction is right now. That thing is so loud. It I feel like somebody's got a drill in my home. It is I'm getting good vibrations and you're just from here on that to everything. Ben and Jerry's is near the rain force cafe between the MC theaters and blooming nails on the south side of Evan Tura. Noon to two this Saturday. Okay. Look at this board boy. These people pissed off and fired up. Oh, wow. Is of course not. We got one call on the board. 560 5060 on a mobile one line. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Yes sir. Hey man. I'm going to the to the new arena. Um in the bottom month. Um, I need to know the parking over there. Uh, which is the best exit to get into. Uh huh. I think try your back. Go. That's the one. That's your little buddy again. How would you put him on here? Even if it's our only call. Why would you put him on there? Okay. Your little stick boy friend. Get him out of here. 560 5050 5060 on a mobile one line. Here's Wilton Manor. Hello. Yes sir. Are you real big with our screens here and what the man is. Uh huh. I wouldn't pile on me. I heard it twice. Uh with podcasts for Noah. He played your uh type of the kid playing with his Santa's there. Just a little spiral. How could he be playing that? Oh, the twice. I heard it once last week and I heard it again yesterday. Yeah. Well, won't help. Okay. Okay. Thanks for the fire report. Okay. Anybody out there want to talk because they would just want to do spy reports today. We want to talk about where do you park your uh thing in your. That's what we want to talk about. 560 5060 on a mobile one line. We got Drillin going on over here. It sounds like they're blowing a guy there building up. It sounds like we're in it in the Aladdin casino in Vegas that they just blew down that god. Not soon enough either. What a place that was. Here's a mobile in Pembro Pines. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes sir. One of the few of you saw the article in the paper about the kids that college student that uh took a cat a caffeine overdose and died on a dare. Didn't see that. Yeah. It's in the day Sun Sentinel. I'm what pay what section. I don't remember about it my car. I forgot. I just I thought you loved that one. I think the dare. Yeah. Some of his friends really approximately 90 films almost the whole bottle. And he's dead. And uh, he's dead. Okay. Thanks for the good news. There you go. That's why they call institutions of higher learning. Because your kids are going off there seeing what assholes they can be. How much booze they can drink. How many pills they can pop before they croak? Open line in day two and brown are in 560 5050 60 on a mobile one line. Here's a mobile in Miramar. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. I just wanted to call you. I was at the game Friday night. Yeah. And if you weren't there, the only cheer that it got from a fan to fans will mess you up. Made a goal. Right. That's right. What a bunch of get deep. All and all the reasons I went to the ticket were given to me. Thank God because I wouldn't have paid for them. I like I said yesterday they should have given us refunds on a way outside the door saying we're very sorry. We hope you know we apologize for this and we pray it never happens again. Well, just he's short of the game. You give us all the reason to cheer up you're there. Okay. I'll be there pal. See you tomorrow night. Redweights. See here tomorrow night we're playing the two time defending Stanley Cup champions arguably the best team at Lake Detroit Redweings. And so naturally you want to put your best line up out there again. So it's going to be one hell of a tough contest and no question about that. And we got a coach on it and you know something the reason that this goes on in every aspect in politics with the fixed elections in Miami in baseball with the trade in the way to hold God the team and giving you the worst record in a whole all the way 54 and 108 after winning the world series. And now this thing that they're doing to do hockey team the reason it goes on is because they can do it because this is a place where nobody even says anything even for free for months I kept saying where is the outrage about what Wayne high-pinga has done to the mallon where is the anger where is the outbreak could I find it? No and it's going to be the same thing here Terry Maurice is going to absolutely decimate and we know not that we had that much to begin with to be honest with you except a couple of promising rookies but other than that so he's going to decimate with little hopes we hit and does anybody have anything to say about it? No as you will you just waiting for the steamer to run over your ass and keep doing it I enjoyed it's an S&M place I'm finally catching on. Dayd-Live's open 560 5060 pound 560 on a mobile one line here's Lake Horace hello. Welcome Neil yes sir. Andrew hey. Rue up some use my real name again yes please. Oh are you okay.

exterior and the sign and the whole deal it's ready to go steak and shake oh yeah you know the thing that store is closed the one with the parking lot that we're gonna have to leave so right if you want to go to the question we've been working here at ten months and every day when i come to work i pass the the truck's sub shop right in the corner there we love your truck and and he's he and i make my turn on the four forty one and i see the sign that's his Walgreens coming soon now maybe they're right i'm there it's open it is yeah i bought these coughed up there how we supposed to know

hole so the Walgreens is actually open because i was going to say that would be a great place for a steak and shake right next door just about oh here's a crawl spring hello hello there yes sir i had a bunch of things on a list here i wanted to talk about one with the steak and shake i can see one right here in crawl spring that university i can't wait okay i didn't just like that fact i think what we ought to do is we'll send a world to make down a list of locations and we'll tell them where to stick it we could do their work for them why should they look we tell them where we're gonna be and then they built them all tell them what's happening where to stick if you haven't by christmas time right um the uh uh the thing about way and i think that's wonderful right there's all about yardy got to stop but don't expect any great things to happen with the hockey team now because i've got 15 million on this uh i never thought about that that's right right i've got another reason

eyesight's pretty good and i don't see any of that crowd good guy who's thorac at marries who's sungrabble and baby the little bit of the fact that when people show up year after year they have a passion for they have a feeling for there's none of that here because you know they show up whatever to how they can get a ticket then uh and that's it i think i think because they you know it's right

like going into a restaurant where the food used to be really great and every time you go gets a little bit worse and a little bit worse and the portions get a little bit smaller to the point where and the prices by the way keep going up keep going up and the state that used to be 25 bucks now it's 50 bucks but they give you like a little tiny turd in the middle of a plate and say here you go

book about the NFL player yeah there's a a Leonard Liddle who plays for the St. Louis Ram yeah the woman died by the way and in by the way we had the story wrong on this radio station we had the story wrong several days ago when he announced that all he was not under the influence of no charges of being filed guess what surprise yeah he was a little twice above the legal limit right now maybe he could be a school bus driver he is right there you go in fact an excellent idea there you go okay thanks for the good news all these all these dark complexed guys who just have problems baby who just

weekend because I was here in town so what else am I going to do I should thought tea I'm going to watch that damn thing and it was great yeah and there's a longer version available if you buy the DVD yeah which is out now but I haven't got a DVD play any good why but eventually maybe I was stuck in this put oh I guess you've got a greater claim to fame than the times well what whatever she was doing even it was like just a home video she probably had more viewers than than she's got now obviously that's a lot of course that news guys one thing if if you add all the different times that it's on it's like mash if you put all the times mash is on they probably got about a four share huh sure because that's four times one is four last time I check in fact if they would put us on 30 times we'd still have a because nobody can hear the goddamn audio so 30 times zero it's still that's right no it's in like I said why do I get myself worked up into a leather about these things they put together a pretty good show there until the very end last the night when they were doing the Joe Rose Duane stomping and chopping uh yeah they know I figure who the hell cares now by this time everybody's turned it off anyone nobody can hear it but other than that it was pretty entertaining I'm sitting there with a chicken on my head I mean we're else in America can you watch your guys sitting there making a jackass of myself what a chicken on his head probably a television first but was there anybody watching of course not you can't hear the guy dancing if you want to hear it and the homm keeps getting louder and louder and louder in fact maybe that's the idea just stick your on TV screen get a good home job there for the prices right and nobody cares nobody that and I said to Georgia this morning I need help I really do I need psychiatric counseling not as a person but as somebody who lives here because in order to survive in this town you have to be willing to lower your standards I'm not talking about being better than anybody also goody to choose but you have to lower your standards to such a low degree that you don't give a f*** anymore you just don't care like my good friends there pop at all park I listen I don't want to bore you with the because it's the pressing place to begin with but I'm telling you everything that I deal with practically in this town is doing and people that you're trying to do a job for and they still don't want to give you any copy any information it's like oh we don't know what you're talking about what are you bothering us for that that's the mentality in this time what are you bothering us for just dummy up in the ghost bend your money and have a great life and leave us alone but I'm trying to do a job or forget about we don't care we just go through the motions anyway no matter what it is like this radio station we got so many people are just content to go through the motions and if you open up a mouth you're a bastard I mean I know that there are people that hate me like poison is placed do I care no of course not I couldn't give a crap less and that's my big mistake you're supposed to be part of our fraternity you're not supposed to be trying to do a professional job stop making so much goddamn trouble and I'm not just talking about here I'm talking about it's like the thing with the panthers I haven't had one call here today on that not one not one okay did I give him a chance in the beginning you bet I said hey is a good guy I met him I had a couple of good conversations I think he's better new people think let's give him a chance and then we'll see him okay because he's a bozo taking our best players stick him on a bench stick him on a fourth line with a couple of goons on a goon line and then of course he's gonna be saying well it's not scoring well how is he gonna score when he's playing with a couple of goofballs out there that's like the leaf say but you know tie dome you're not scoring enough goals you're not gonna play anymore but that was that and these people are nothing phases them they're perfect for this town I apologize I'm the one that's out of place you guys you're in the right place those days when we have no guy damn calls at all that's perfect that's a perfect reflection of what this town is all about you can do anything to this community and they don't care they take it without so much as a whimper fixed elections I mean you name it drugs all over the guy damn place kids getting killed on street corners don't bother us with these things you're too goddamn negative sorry mister sorry eight minutes after a broadcasting whether was Camille Souser Senator water whatever charity was we used to get a nice check from the sales manager the program director which we did get blood thank you block you're the only one the only person and WQA who's donated a dime to our charity so far is bluffing Z. Does that tell you what you need to know about this place and how involved we are in this radio station I mean we I don't care what we said in that meeting on Friday and by the way I wish I had on tape we'd get a 90 share we just put it on whammy I wish I had that meeting on tape not the part with me and the Greg Reed the part with Norma Kent I just want to tell all of you out there including people who hate me like poison maybe the feeling is mutual I wouldn't wish Norma Kent on any of you okay here is a man the worst thing that ever happened to this guy is that he had a few of those shows on F.T. L and we really think he was in radio he thinks he was a broadcast I've been telling him over and over again you weren't even close to being on radio F.T. L was to radio what whammy is to television it's not even on the edge okay it's not even the same league it's not in the same business it's not in San Boe Kabilary it's way on the outside look it in and we're talking about the situation with a hurricane for example and about how the station is ill prepared to cover like the natural disasters hurricanes wars etc and maybe the way we ought to approach that and Norma to give you one of his classic lines says well you know like Hank could come on here and say there's a high fly ball to right field is back by and the wind is blowing it up because we got the hurricane coming part is he serious I said Norm shut up in fact if I could tell you how many times I said that during that meeting see one good thing is that I never hear from him unless I call him like remember you gave me that message you have the day from somebody who's interested in syndicating our show and I gave it right to him that was on Friday when he was here if I heard from him since I hear from him unless I call him first and I got a chase him down a waste my time anymore first night he is perfect for this time he fits in here like a glove just don't do it like Nancy Reagan would say it kind of like a take off on it no matter what it is fill in the black just don't do it and it won't get done and everybody will say okay fine we have an open line in date count the high fly ball to right field it's going and the wind takes all of it and it's hurricane filling the black and that's how Hank could cover the hurricane he was serious okay we're too a Miami hello okay sir I can't believe they actually paid Mike T.O. for $91 why not why not you got mark requires semi-sauce so they did a story on them can take up a collection I mean Tiger Wars has done crap I mean if I think it probably has a crap every now and then yeah take your shake I like it's coming down here for real that's what it says oh why maybe 20 locations by next summer well maybe we can call it through your two all right hey they bought out hardy so we can get that we can hit those ebonic burgers baby all right baby he call i burgers yeah okay have a great day good out here we have an open line tool of mandate County boy keep burning myself on these goddamn matches and pretty soon I'm not gonna have no fingers left 5 6 7 0 5 60 see that's got punishing you mister for smoking those goddamn cigars those stogies and pom 5 60 on the AT&T wireless line here's a bokeh hello yes sir can I respond to what you said about the panthers earlier the morning uh this isn't one of our chronics is it no oh i'm in bokeh Ray Whitney was on there with Geldy between periods the other night of the Vancouver game yeah and I don't know what what did they end up paying Ray Whitney uh one practice every game he gives 200 percent he's a him because he's a big foot in a position being a little guy he has to try twice as hard as the bigger guys in order to make it because he thought his career was over when Edmonton caught him and then we picked him up and he had the opportunity made the most of it and keep in mind keep in mind that Ray Whitney accomplished what he's the last year on a crappy team I mean it's one thing to get those statistics on a hell of a team like Stu Barnes did plan with the you know Francis and Yager but when you accomplished it on a team where nobody else is doing much of anything he was like a one man offensive show for us on a team and he still is right well he can't do it on a bench and he certainly can't do it on a fourth line play with Peter Orrell in Dwayne eight you know to me Ray Whitney's the best forechecker we have on the team I see the pun. Wish you could have seen the two games that he played against the Leafs Saturday and last night Marty struck a he hit and he's on the number one line isn't it interesting Yarmor Yager who played great last night with Stu Barnes and Marty struck it that's the number one line for the penwoods that are playing pretty damn good yeah but Marty struck Chris Welch you got Chris Welch who hasn't played a game for the same since March 26th who's injured every day and who even when he wasn't injured before he got hurt with sitting in the stands in a suit every night and though we'd rather have him than dug away I mean these guys I'm going to tell you a story in Ryan Murray and Terry Murray we're in a real hockey town doing the things that they've been doing last couple of years they'd have been out of town on a rail on Tonya which is why they have been no not raised out of town everywhere they've been you know Ray Wittler all night Victor Coslov Ray Wittney and a couple of these new kids other than that is really right there's nobody to watch offensively because there's nothing going on we'll call the spokesman to get his finger out of it okay we'll do it shea the spokesman I you know something I'm glad I didn't throw those buttons away in fact I still have that cardboard sign in my car it says you know no BM we're going to have to get what I says no TM too because these guys are determined that they're going to be they're going to show what these guys they're going to get yeah if you're going to send a message to somebody don't do it by bench in the guys when the best players on the team do it by bench in the guys who are sticking the join out stick robby need a miles that you'll get a standing ovation if you have the guts to let Terry Murray but you don't have the balls to do it stick his ass on a bench and don't tell me how great he played against the caps on Friday okay one game don't make a career one assist one easy pass to a guy wide open in front of the net doesn't make a guy damn case for guidance getting to an half million dollars a year and isn't it interesting how they gave that negatively amount to ray would need and they practically took a mic down to arbitration and then like two or three days before and they only reason the only reason that they settled and made that deal with him before own arbitration is that caused the days before that mark wrecking and peer at two jongo those gigantic record breaking settlement awarded by the arbitrators and they were peeing in their pants that would he might get two three million dollars year if they went to arbitration so they said okay we'll do this and for my opinion Whitney's agent knuckles under two weeks there took two little money but let's punish the guys who are working for two little and who are working there guts out us let's punish them and try to make an example of them and the guys who are making a most money on the things we don't do a squat out there let's reward them by playing and put the stick in them out there over and over and over again I'm I'm telling you better be prepared for Thursday and Friday because after tomorrow night I'm going to be so horny I'm going to be a horse with a guy covered with a name we have an open line in date one in brown here's Davy hello Davy yes sir hey Harry okay okay yeah this is why I called you mentioned something about hurricane it's funny I was watching the cone doing 180 around oh yeah that's right channel 4 in channel 7 I saw a little bit of boring last night he's on areas got his suit on he's all where he looks like John Glenn he looks like he's getting ready to take off in the space shuttle and he don't need a shuttle but in any rate yeah he's hyperventilated they're getting ready for it to do a big good twist in a turn that's really not cool yeah I like to answer the old guy that's counting how many black school best drivers are yeah there's zero at full all school but there's are yellow but never thought about anyway hey hey what about those Chinese like you want to go anyway I gotta go jet Joe Bruce coming up okay see you haha haha haha haha haha haha we have an open line in date one in brown at five six seven oh five sixy and five five sixy on the eight that's the kind of people we have in this town are people sitting around looking out the window counting the number of black school bus drivers does that tell you all you need to know about this town yeah you'll bet your sweet bed acid does people with no lives that's why there's no passion here whoever heard a dead people have in passion there's no emotion there's no feeling there's no outrage there's no anything there's no good passion there's no bad passion there's no even mediocre look warm passion and I said he airvy god damn they have my life screaming and puking and yelling and I hear off of that you know that there's fires like screaming into a goddamn tunnel and you hear like in a bag yeah that's it that's what you get back that's the echo man two way in the media is this a leap out badly if five sixty w q amp boys this phone smoke at a one open line in brown all three and day again I guess everybody had decided to take some time off and go out and start counting school bus drivers yeah let's take a pull on that what do you think let's not go out there in a corner standing on the corner watching all the school bus drivers go by and taking notes five six seven oh five sixty pamp five sixty on the eighteen two wireless line here's call spring hello hi Neil yes sir are you doing buddy okay how can we look for the boxes if

that that's that was our hockey call right there the Murphy's suck okay brim Murphy and Terry Murphy or hi Gassumatu he's talking about talking about gritty is he had a thing so there's what I see that's why you can't discuss anything in this time because nobody knows what you're talking about they have all those people that show up and I keep asking that question I really don't know why two open lines is did a lady mobile in West Palm Beach hello lady mobile in West Palm Beach long gone okay like I said George's over time to go home we'll stay up we love you welcome Miami all you've

five six seven oh five sixty are you follow me my given these numbers two phases that the problem five six seven oh five sixty pound five sixty on the AT&T wireless line I must be missing something or and I've talked about John Glenn is he too old yeah we already know that I keep every time I see John Glenn I TV I get oh that sounds he's coming into my mind oh just like that I don't know what that means here's a West Palm Beach hello hey Neil it's right it's what right I'm with Palm Beach I have something to tell you that I've been seeing on the television you know MCI commercial yeah when tabs

about it and the stuff I talked about so now they're all searching and reaching I thought the by far the most stimulating call we had was about the black guy you just school got a bus driver right let's hear it for that guy you know something and you guys thought that he was bad but at least he called that's something I'll say for him he made out of head much material but he had the courage of his own god damn convictions and his six X Y's here's for Lauderdale hello hey how you doing know all right I probably we doing okay there for about now and a half and all of a sudden we ran into a god damn brick wall I can't do this thing with Whitney is really it's so annoying right you and I must be the only one who cares there's nobody in that whole crowd that shows up Erbie home game nobody all seems to give a crap they've got no opinion I mean he was the hardest worker he makes plays and guys like Don Yee Kanye is this about five open next either my half a sleep out there and they take Whitney out yeah yeah and then he's gonna put him back in on the significance of that what is he gonna accomplish out there playing an online with two goon and he'd apply maker and as you know as
