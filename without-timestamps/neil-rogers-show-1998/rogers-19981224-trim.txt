Mrs. Howard Kleinberg there to good people damn it. So anyway, Howard comes over to me and he's a give me a song of dance about how sick he was he had a little hip problem now he's doing great thank god and uh he says to me so the re-a blown out the first team on I said So anyway, I mean it's just it's amazing you know so let's just keep guessing okay are they really you know yeah yeah yeah you'll just have to keep listening huh let's play that game like they try to put it away babbling brook let me say it again I have no problem I'll publicize anybody on any other station because we have no fear we're not concerned we're not the least bit concerned that brook is gonna like give Hank any uh this conversation otherwise in fact I'm sure he's like kissing the ground that they put that babbling brook on or any afternoon what wonderful confidence that anybody can only pray for that god I can answer to anybody's prayers right so anyway I'd speak in the game last night I have just a few brief comments it's the holidays I don't want to put like a negative spin on anything although there is a little negativity in the paper here this morning finally it's just in the hockey column this is in the scum Sentinel so it must be that fat Michael Russo he says the new building is trying to work out it's never ending kinks maybe to connect the kinks in concert there huh the sound coming out of the loudspeakers continues to be either too loud too low or too mumbled almost all the time and in the middle of put the plates up periodically the horn sounds could be great and confusion on the eyes there you go only at the macarina baby the National Carbactyl Center where the only arena in the world that has these extra added accoutement okay in the lecture charge you know before I before the game and those poor kids that I have no idea from the young hockey players some budding you know future NHL stars they're out there and they're given them an award for whatever and they pay if you're life dependent on it you couldn't understand award that this guy's saying uh if they held it was the up your ass you couldn't decipher what this poor bastard's saying on the PA and yes the horn does come in there which is good because it kind of wakes us up a little bit every now and I think that's what it's for kind of a wake up sound right but poor that was in it's the first time in the new arena I will probably say that I left early I mean real early once a Washington Square there's second go over to about five minutes before the second period got up made a beeline out of that join my please that I did that you bet oh man talk about a coma but then anyway did not listen I just want to say this and I really mean it I'm not going to carry on about the fact that the red light you can't see it from where we are when the goal is going to be and about the a fan I don't give it sh** me well that's right I mean you are what you are like they said in the godfather uh three was it yeah when he said the venturi said you are what you are a piece of stuff in that was a gay son no well that was an other story that was off camera but at any rate uh so we you are what you are that's what this whole call fan they have no clue if you listen to the conversation that's going on you know we got to have two bars that well what team is he on now I am who's on that yeah right they know from nothing but their favorite see I've discovered what the problem is they really don't want to see hockey they want to see they want to do all stuff I talked about the wave and they look up on the scoreboard and they want to see the WWF or they want to see you know my ties and two somebody's zero off they want to see boxing wrestling they want to see brawling that's what maybe a little mud wrestling that's what they want to see right there you go because they've got a major Peter problem at the macarina a big black guy named Peter I'm going to take this guy there were showing pictures in between periods of the different players with a little Christmas messages and you know here's Ray Whitney up there and here's Billy Lindsay you know here's guys that you could like a lot and here's Peter World and and of course what he got into one of his 18 brawls during the game including one which he didn't get a penalty for which is very bizarre but nevertheless and when he you know he's picking up his glove and his stick and the holding and three sitting ovation's on the same penalty there are obsessed they really believe that this is a hockey player and like I said I don't give it so I find that if that's your idea of what is the hockey player then good luck to you okay and one of the that just we we enforce is what I said the other day yeah we just just thought I have the grab ass out there everybody partying get up I want to round to have to work about standing in front of other people forget the game okay and fact we can have a little little we'll have what we'll do is we'll have a bunch of big black guys beating the crap out of each other out there right the middle they are joined huh I was gonna say the middle of the ice but we will we would melt the ice because the refrigeration cost the fortune so we want to save way in the 31 million bucks for the salaries and also that refrigeration system just shut that baby down baby shut it off yeah I'm serious not a good idea yeah I thought they called that boxy no no not boxing I'm no they want to see well that's why they do like boxing because it's usually too big black guys beating on each other they love that like I love it but just I mean just a free for all not boxing no rules you know just beating the living crap maybe you know bringing each other like to the edge of death maybe like into a coma they would love it so that's my idea for the new year for the immaculate of the national car rectal center a putrid performance last night by the way boys everybody's done to join out there wasn't one player on our team that uh even rate Whitney stumped you about everybody on the play I mean you guys were brutal it was pathetic little warm in here by the way isn't it is it just me that'd be you might be me if you poisoned yourself with that you have poisoned myself with all that rig because I had to kill about 400 ants in here all of into this morning which is kind of nice that you work for company especially Christmas time that can't afford an exterminator. It's made of the name the peppers have lost again so I'm looking for a doggy some things I must say to him and what I find him you wore a pouch out his life I say you asshole you coast very bad to dying you coast very bad because you didn't listen to your uncle you he's the others are you the real the car you watch us stop the so the house from Canada all day can't stop I died in a old life hey bear drinkers do you find that your beer not only fills you up it binds you up you need a beer that will help you lose it up introducing the beer that not only tastes great it packs omega high fiber walla it's the first beer that's also a laxative we call it shats it say baby monster yes quiet hi time still homes form right before you're a self-a-shaft and see why it's making a splash all over the country.

Okay, anyway, speaking of stories in the news, even though it is the holidays, there have to share this really exciting news with you. Teacher of the year quits lied about felony, the former Catholic priest, lied. Can you believe this? Former Catholic priest lied. About his molestation conviction when he applied to the D.J. Palm Beach community college. On Friday the day he was to receive teacher of the year honors at Palm Beach Community College, a horticulture instructor resigned after official learning lied on his job application after being convicted a convicted child molester. Walter M. Weirts 63, a former Catholic priest, was sentenced to six years in Illinois State Prison in 1986 after putting guilty to three counts of aggregated criminal sexual abuse involving boys between the ages of province 16. The Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office is investigating Weirts after receiving a complaint that a young boy from New Mexico who was staying at Weirts home might have been abused here as Sergeant Jim Storm said on Wednesday. The boy has returned home and charges are unlikely because in an interview the boy had with the Mexico authorities turned up no evidence of a crime. Weirts who taught at Palm Beach Gardens campus could not be reached for a comment. College officials said they believe he has left the state. I can't imagine why but he has left the state and the building. Go on. There you go. By the way, that's for our friend John and Lake Worth. Thank you, John. And you're welcome for a plane at Bob and Tom. Also, if that isn't enough here to let kind of temper your enthusiasm for the holidays, here's another great story.

Do you fear your nephew is in hell? I feel that my nephew is in that whistle on the film. Not with the Lord. In other words, in hell. I don't know. I swear you don't want to know. And because they take part in his body, I don't remember. You fear that Roman Catholic Communus Bay, H.E.R. deaf use body. Yes. All right. We have on the light of Van Eyes here, a Roman Catholic priest on KFI in 640 home. I know. Good. But let's remember, first of all, I put my condolences to you on the Lord with your nephew. Say your treat. Your family. Yes. Okay. So I just want to let you expect something for you, okay? Yes. So this is just, you've been listening to what I'm talking about. You've been talking about. You've been talking about. What is the interesting kind of an old experience you would like to believe in? And then you can draw your own conclusion. But you need people. The next thing we're teaching is, and you draw your own conclusions. Let's do your father explain, okay? First of all, we believe that when you see this communion, we see the body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, turn my God. Well, hold on, man. No, I mean, I'm just calling to let you know what my belief is. You eat flesh and blood. If you want to look at that with your blood. Oh, my God. What? This is our belief and you're going to conclude your own conclusion. Man, you got to let the father explain. Why would I want to let him talk about it? If he didn't listen to me, this is my show reason. Like I said, you're wrong. Okay, you're wrong. Okay, you're wrong. Because you've been missing for a month. What happened to your feet? You've been hurt. Oh, wait. You eat the back, you eat the whole damn thing. Excuse me? Don't you eat it? We're the host. Yes. The host. But he's pleased to hear about it, you know, the man. That's not what I said. You said you eat the blood, the flesh of the Lord. Oh, man. No, of Jesus Christ. Oh, God. That is a blasphemy. Why would he tell me that? Oh, I'm trying to do it in front of my body. He's not going to give you the vision in front. Do you eat the whole ability, too? I'm not going to answer that. I don't understand what that means. What does this man talk about eating the Lord Jesus? What is this? What is this? Let him just say what he has to say. The scriptures, man, were Jesus Christ, Greg, and blessed and broken and said, Take this and eat it. This is my body. I'm going to put the cup of wine. You said, take and drink. This is my blood. And again you said, I'm going to see with my body and drink. My blood has no right to take. Oh, my child. This is good, right? Exactly. You talking about eating the blood on Jesus. I'm going to call you. I'm going to call you. What we believe. You grab it on Jesus, and you say, oh, Jesus. Why? You're just a believer. Grab it on all our own Jesus. If that is Jesus, you're the belief. And my Lord, let's hear what about him. I'll pick him up. I'll pick him up. Again, macaron Jesus, stand Catholic. Mac, don't mind boys. I'm Mac, don't you?

Mac, some kind of Negro smoke is going over there. Well, I'll tell you. Listen, don't you know, explain it. I don't even understand. I'm like a brother, but I'm a brother. I'm going to call him. Listen, Father, I thank you for taking the time. I really do. I'm going to get these things. Well, you pay for your sins. Well, I'll give it a big time. That's true. Thank you, Father. All right. That was a Roman Catholic priest. And Mac, don't mind boys. Like a better buffet. Oh, you can eat me. What was it? I can't even eat you. What do you call, man? You can eat me. I can't. Oh, no. All you can eat me, bro. So, I have to speak. Good thing you're here, Mac. Oh, no. Gosh, I'm wearing some. I don't know what you got me talking. I'm a passion song. I don't know the story about how you got Sloan. I got you down. Okay. Jad and yeah, holy drown. Oh, oh, oh, oh. I'll tell you once more before I came up to Sloan. I got you down. One thing you need to understand is, so you will. Don't forget that I will do it. Yeah, then I back in the large house. But once again, I don't know about Oh, Mary. I showed her book, and she know it'd be like, you know, though how I saw this walk and the heart has finished it. Yes, yeah. I just didn't know what it is like, she slaps my stomach in the bag. You can access it. So, dear, Madam! Madam can see it in the bag. Okay, after I crashed P��ock's purse, The dinosaur belt. The owner is here. I forgot the one, I got you down. I got you down. Here on the show there's a new topic each night. Don't you hear a sex lick with a blacker running right? I got you down. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Holy cow. I got you down. Okay, nine after one, five, 50 WCM, five hundred and ten bucks over there in Aventura so far not to exciting that to bad. Not too less than lady kind of week. So that gives us one twenty three six eighty four. We're getting close. We need another three hundred and sixteen bucks. And then I spent the one minutes to get to one hundred and twenty four grand a day. No, we're going to do it all. Come on. So we do it. I want to hear it enthusiasm. No. Okay, 12 after one. Here's the greatest and great. Somebody's fact is to maybe because I don't want to birth anybody's bubble but Siky the truth and you will not read the Sun Sentinel. Did you see this? Were they reprinted this old, trashy piece of crap? It says on this is on the editorial page in a Sun Sentinel where I've all courses the same paper that told us where's that thing that told us that people who don't bet on ball games are just as interested in the odds and the points breads is those who do bet on ball games. That's right. So why would they lie about Sandy Claus? So they've it's just one of the most famous letters to be at it or ever who's been bitten by an 80 year old girl who had doubts about Santa Claus in a halting hand she saw help on the New York Sun. The answer, first published September 21st, 1897 over a hundred freaking years ago has turned the hearts of American Ever since. Today we were printed letter in the Sun's reply and an editorial written by Francis Farse Ellis Church. What a name huh? As in Farse, Farseville. The editor, I'm eight years old. Some of my little friends say there is no Santa Claus. If you see it in the Sun it's so please tell me that truth is there a Santa Claus Virginia or Henland. Dear Virginia, your friends and your family are all full of crap. Oh that's not what it is. Nobody goes on about the end of an not believe in Santa Claus. You might as well not believe in Faris. Huh? Yes, there's nobody see Santa Claus but that's no sign of the Santa Claus. The most real things in the world are those that need the children or men can see. And then here's the greatest line in this whole letter to the editor. Did you ever see Faris dancing on the lawn? Yeah sure all the time in the grow. What is that? South Beach all the time. Did we ever see Faris dancing on the lawn? And it says of course not. Well that's before we at South Beach. Thank God he lives forever. Santa Claus is a great favor, Jenny. I hope you're still alive. I'll assure that you're down there deep in the ground because God works in the Stereus ways but nevertheless they're ain't most candy claws. They're ain't no tooth theory. There are some Faris and South Beach in the grow. But that's about it. I'm out of my leaving out and of course the God Bullcraft don't leave that out. I don't know what it is but it's moving.

Okay, what's 45 at 5.50 WC, so we got 650 bucks and then the block just brought in the check-in of the X-Lady Broph or 100 bucks, so that's 750 which brings our grand total out to the North for 100,000, 120,000, 984, a wait a minute. What am I talking about? 16 bucks, oh, we didn't scrape up 16 bucks, I'll put it in the 16 bucks. Huh?

So there you go, there's our 16 bucks to get us to 124,000, so like I told you, even though it was a little slow over there in Adventurer and primarily because we ran out of the CDs on part one, which is phenomenal, by the way. There was a tremendous rush on those of all the one CDs we ran out for a shop, but we still have plenty of CD of number two, and we also have cassettes of both one and two. And of course the best deal in the old T-shirts, which nobody wears in public and we understand why. So, it's 124,000, even not bad. And it shouldn't be done. I bet your buddy Evans is real in France. This should be on a front page of both newspapers tomorrow. Faggot on QA, and Marys is 124 grand for charity in South Florida. I'm the hold of my breath.
