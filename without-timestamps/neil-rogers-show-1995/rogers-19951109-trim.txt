to be a good day. And we just got a memo here and it just goes to show you that if you're under enough stress and pressure you eventually crack. From Steve Nichol. It says. What is that? Wow, it says, um, tomorrow. I'm not going to be here. Phil's not going to be here. Both going to wait for a long holiday weekend. Even though it's yeah, it's a holiday. Right? It's veterans day, right? They're going to be people not working to mark us. It's holiday. So I'm not working. It says instead of playing four hours of the best of Neil tomorrow, we're going to play one hour between 10. Are you, uh, you know, this year. I went. I just found out right now. 10 and 11 a morning and then they'll air the worst of Randy. Randy Rhodes last show. The worst of Randy are you ready for that? Is that the one where she said, I think so. If you didn't hear herself destruction of your half ago, now's your chance. Boy, that's really nasty and vicious and mean. Ain't it? Well, it's where it goes. And after Randy will do the best to fill. So in other words, what he's really saying is that we don't have enough tapes since I'm going on vacation at the end of next week. Anyway, we don't want to like play him 45 times. So we'll play the worst of Randy. Just as a stork, just as a stick at the back, we'll turn it in there and little twisted and we'll yank it, etc. Okay. Okay. Anyway, it's a 10 past 10 of that. So you IOD, happy Friday too. Look at that set or one total, baby. 25,600 31 bucks. Well, that thing don't seem awful. Out of a sudden, does that? Did you turn that down or what? Because it was just blaring before it was blasting. The needles were rocking. 25,631, you can order your best to recon suds, kneel or and or fill Henry C.D. and cassette and the t-shirts by calling 561- 0078. Do it now. Do it like today. And they're doing a great job of shipping those things out if you want them for like a holiday president or if you want them for like a circus or whatever. T-Shaba, 561- 0078, or you can stop by your borders, books, music and cafes stores and crores brings them to a candle they got to CDs. They got the cassettes, they got the good stuff. And etc. Also, you can dial 100 all kneel because your just getting really depressed. We're not going to be able to retire on that. It looks like buck 49, the first minute, 99 cents a minute after that. 1,900 all kneel. We got all kinds of neat stuff on here and cost a comments from other listeners and the parts from the show and commentaries from me and the stuff like that. 1,900 all kneel. Call everybody in O'N tapah. Call people who never heard of me before. Tell them it's really interesting and make up the story. Okay, they'll dial it. So we've got a whole bunch of stuff going on. Colin Powell, baby. That's why I played dual man this morning because that's your choice. Now, Bubba and Dullah. How what a choice that is. You talk about Dull and boring man this guy. The Republicans are going to self-destruct. That's all because Colin Powell wasn't right wing enough. And because Rabin just got off to the Middle East and his wife started to get real nervous and he said, they know thank you. And now it's going to be dull. Trust me when I tell you. Or maybe Bob Dornner and repap you can and one of those really funny guys. And that's going to be your choice. So no column polls. So all you people are getting ready to start hyper-ventilating like you did over Ross P. R. O. Four years ago. Then of course we still got the Ross factor. He's probably pretty excited. Now he's going to get a lot more for your time and learn to get that tongue out and just look his private. It's like real heavy doing now. Because all we also got to have that we got a lot of stuff going on. Man, we got to have that cart in here now for this hour. That's right out at the bottom of my piece here. And then also we got to figure out I don't have the sheet on it where our kickoff for tickets to the Super Bowl thing is. Since that seems to be changing by the moment. But don't forget tomorrow. We got the worst of Randy from 11 to 2. 10 13. She's probably going to get porked off about that. 10 13 at W. I. O. D. Biscayne's closing. Biscayne is closing. Hollywood bought it and Biscayne's going out. They're going to be like another big condo there. Oh, I was 15 when I lost my virginity. And I remember the plate not the date though. But I was over by the doorhouse under the club in a cow pasture. As you've known, they've been till midnight on news, talking entertainment radio. 16 W. I. O. D. This is the Neal Roger show. Yeah. This is your brain. Any question? 10 13. When the hell did I say it was Friday? I never said it was Friday. Did I say it was Friday? It feels like Friday because I'm not going to be here this week. But I don't think ever said it was Friday. Did I come on here here today and say at one time at any point, this is God damn Friday here today? It's Friday. You best. One is wrong with these people. Turn up your hearing aids. Graham. Oh, can't cut the crap. But to knit pickers. So anyway, it looks pretty grim on the panthers. Now they say, well, you know, the heat's more important anyway. It's the NBA and they got that television coverage and a TV contract. Guess what? Are you both Oh, commissioners? The TV money don't go in your pocket or pay for the arena or going any of the public's pocket. It's going to go right and Mickey Harrison's pocket. You morons. You fools. And I noticed by the way that the attendance here, even though was much better than we have for the Panthers, they still didn't have a cell out for the second heat home game. They want them both. But they had a few hundred empty seats for that. One two last night. How do you like that? All right. The whole was that. So here's something that goes, and this is only the beginning. Only the beginning. Biscayne chief agrees to sell mutual license. All dog tracks grounds will be put on the block. So Hollywood Greyhound is buying out biscayne and they're going to put the property on a lot. They're going to sell it and that's going to be the end. No more. They've run their last race at biscayne. Is that incredible or what? They used to be like a goddamn landmark. They used to be a really great place and they spent tons of money spitting it up and doing all kinds of stuff. And you know, I didn't go any more either. I don't know what it is, but I don't know what it is. Just stop going and evidently sort of everybody else. The paramutuals baby, a lot of moron away out, a lot of moron away out. Thing of the past. Because after all gambling is evil. Isn't that what it's all about? Oh, and also there's another thing here on this memo, which is for broadcast, I guess. It says on Sunday after football, 8 to 10 PM this Sunday will be hearing a program for the country's fastest growing minority. People who smoke cigars. All right. The show is called smoke this imported from Tampa. Uh-oh imported from Tampa and hand rolled for the cigar fish, you know, so I don't know what they'll really use, but it's from Tampa. Oh, cigar smoke or show. Oh, somebody was telling me, you know, that restaurant in the forlaterale. It's called smokers, I think. Isn't that the name of it? Or they invite you to come in if you smoke. Faggot's or cigars. Or even if you just are a faggot, they were telling me the food there is sensational. And you can smoke and not be bothered, not have people threaten to blow your brains out. And that's it. You know, if you want to have long cancer, it's a free goddamn country, okay? Yeah, but that second hand smoke. Yeah, how about your second hand breath? How about that second hand cheap perfume that a lot of these people wear these women, especially some of the guys on the plane. You're sitting there and oh my god, you want to breath from it. That real cheap cheesy perfume that you buy by the gallon of Kmart. Here's a lady in Keylargle, but she don't wear that do you? Hello. Yes, ma'am. No. Good. Ah, first time call her meal. Great. Hey, I wanted to thank you for turning me on to the diet. Yeah. Yeah. It's great. It is great. It's great. It's great. It's great. It's great. I've lost like 20 pounds and five weeks without even trying. Outstanding. And I tried the Lorenzo's cheesecake just the other day. Yeah. Oh my god. Wonderful. To die for. Oh, yeah, you're not kidding. Somebody sent over a cheesecake yesterday trying to imitate the icons and the George just about, oh, man. Just about brushed in a waste basket. Yes. The best I've ever had. Yeah. Yeah. So I wanted to thank you about that. I have another request. I was trying to get a hold of the guys. I was driving down from Kendall. He largar this morning watching them practice the, uh, the blue angel. Yeah. And they were standing safe. Is there any way I can get some free tickets for my kids? I know you have no available. Oh, come on. Oh, we can't give you free tickets for the blue angels, but we can give you like registration. Maybe to go to Cleveland. To Cleveland. Yeah. For our tragic trip. I don't know if I want to go to the country. But if you, if you when you have to go, is that a real trip or a watch? Yeah. I, I, I never got the details. That's a real trip. It's a real trip. Really. For two. For two. To Cleveland. I've never been to Cleveland. Right. And you can like hang out there where the Browns used to play. Uh-huh. And watch all this people crying and carrying out like a bunch of infants. Uh-huh. Okay. Not so bad. And you can either chuck my or on a radio up there again. Okay. So hang on. Okay. See, she wanted something for free. She got something bad. But hey, that's the way it goes. That's life for you. We have an open line in date. 7, 5, 1. And how about for the family of the year? Let's, let's have a contest. Okay. For the sports rule model family of the year. Is it going to be the blades family that's Brian and Benny? Or is it going to be the consocos? Poor Jose man. At family just can't get out of their own God damn way. You know what I'm saying? Now it's, uh, now we're going to help with that. It's not in the sports section. Is that somewhere else? Cause I did read it this morning about his brother, Ozzy, who used to be quite a sport himself. It must be in the Yoke, oh, yeah. They tried to bury it. Concecule brother charged in a salt. Pembroke pines, the twin brother of baseball Stupid star, Jose Consoco was arrested Wednesday after he shut out the tires of moving van and threatened to moveers during it. It is viewed over his furniture, police said. Police charged as Volvo Ozzy Concecule, who played briefly with the Oakland Asian St. Louis Cardinals, with two counts of aggravated assault in one kind of felony property damage. No one was injured in the 65P. I'm shooting which took place in the driveway. I'll can say goes new home in the chapel trail neighborhood. It's set around so on. I believe that he wanted to look at some of the stuff on the truck he forwarded on order. They wanted to give paid first and they got into a big song to dance. And it says when the movers refuse Concecule went into the house return with a nine millimeter semi automatic handgun, yelling exploders and threatening the men. He came out and fired four rounds from the gun in the tires, flattening five of the suit tires on the truck and threatening the movers. He did not give police his statement. He was booked in the Brown County Jail Lake. Wednesday. All right. They could suckle family. Right up there. Let's have a, let's have a family off. Okay, between him and a blades family. It's nippentuck. It's pretty damn close. Open line and that purple line pound IOD one and day 751, two and a Howard five two four call up today and say goodbye to your Panthers. Baby, it's a done deal. It's not just Hank Goldberg. It's a hippo polymer. Let's night. I dream so can say go. Just like he never let my side know. I'd wait with hope they can say go. He showed me just how to stand over ball. I should all day have to vote. The back of breath was kind of vote. I took off my comb. He kept on his please life. I miss coming round their veins. And fly it into his face. Get the shower with hope they must finish all the body. I have sports family in the air. Baby is it the blades brothers? Is it the con suck up brothers? That's the question today. 10 28 at WIV the winner gets a date with Jose. Doesn't get a date. It's the steroids. Okay, whatever you say. So anyway five six one. Oh seven eight is that center one number 25.631. I have a feeling by the beginning of the week by Monday when we get our next borders report. We're going to be right up there at about 30 grand, which is one hell of a first. Let's see. We just started a week ago yesterday, right? What are you smiling about? We just started the center one thing a week ago yesterday. Am I correct? Wasn't that November 1st? We came up the first. Huh? Wednesday was the first. Oh, week ago yesterday was. Yeah, like I said, God damn it. See you try to make you keep saying it's Friday. I know it's Thursday. It's paid a two by the way. You want my one to check on that. If you're the one that keeps saying it's George that keeps saying it's Friday. Now, me God damn it. I know what day the week it is. Don't I? Well, I'm going to say it's Friday. What does that mean? Here's Latter Hill. Hello. Yes, sir. Just wanted to give you a little spoiler. Okay. Listen to a hip-hop artist. Yeah. And he just kept going on and on about the fact he was five point one to fill four point five. Let me say this, you know, anybody can get a full book and find one demo where they beat somebody else. Okay. If you look at the overall book as usual, Phil beats the living crap out of him. Okay. He's got one demo in men there where he edges him out in one thing. Okay. And besides that, you know, if Hank, you know, Phil hit a right on head yesterday. If Hank doesn't understand that Phil's got more talent in his little finger than Hank's got in his big oozing, puking fat body, then the man's really got serious problems. So it's not even worth talking about. It's a joke. It's more applicable. You know what happened was some guy called up and it's him. He was disguised in his voice. Yeah. And so I wouldn't have been you. What is it? No. Oh, thank you. And he dropped him off the air and then he. Then he repeated the fact that he was 4.1 to 5.1 or, you know, 5.1 to 4.5 and then he just, you know, went on with the next call. What is it? 5.100 pounds? What is that? What he's talking about? He's got, he's got Phil beaten weight. I'll guarantee that. Probably by a couple hundred. Yeah. Later. Okay. Yeah. This Hank thing, man. You know, it's really a sad situation where this guy. Every time he gets a fluke book and his number goes up a little bit, which ever comes down real fast again, where it belongs. Then he starts like peddling a stir. Why don't you understand it, baby? You're on a miserable crappy station that all of the insiders know you went out of there in the worst way, working with a bunch of juvenile kids. It's a joke. It's a laugh. And this guy's on there talking a big story about how he's got, comparing himself to Phil Henry. Anybody with a brain, anybody with even the most miniscule sense of humor knows that Hank Goldberg couldn't lick Phil Henry's ass. He might give it a shot, but he couldn't lick his ass. He's not in the same league with anybody on this radio station, even the sex bitch. Just a big fat glob of pus. Okay. Just a big sloppy New York glob of pus oozing out a lot of garbage. Can't even pronounce the name of the team that he's always talking about that. He don't do the games for no more the dolphins, you know? Just a New York Slob, baby. That's all you're all about. It's sad. I know you wish you were like, you know, here's the guy's got his on his PN. He's on the doos. He's on the ACs. He's on the QA. He's 75 different jobs. He's still ain't making a big bucks. And he's jealous his hell. He's psychotic about it. We have an open line in Broward, 5 2 49 4 6 3 5 2 4 W alde. The man is lacking in only one thing. He's got plenty of fat. He's got plenty of food. He's lacking in one thing. It's called talent. That's the Problem. And I don't care if he has like a 78 here in the next book. Which he won't, but the fact is for him to come on here and try to compare himself to Phil Henry. I take great accepted that, because it's growth test, like he is. He is. Here's Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Let me preference the car by saying I listen to you and feel every day and I love you. Yeah. But I think I, I OD made a big mistake by not putting Howard on in the morning. Yeah. He's just a major talent. He fits in with what you were doing. So let me, let me just tell you this, OK? Yeah. When they were making, when they went through all the thing, I mean, if we want to rehash that we can do it. And it's very painful. But when they blew off a reneary, which I told them, please don't do it because I mean, reneary as much as maybe you didn't like him. He had, you know, he had his following. And they weren't necessarily the same people as mine or Phil's or a Rick and Sud's, but he had his following. And they blew that off and they put on that new show that a board of new show and they blew it, and they admitted it. They knew it. And I always do want to keep saying, hey, put Howard on there. OK. That was it the time before Howard was on in the market. I said, if you put Howard on in the morning, we will own this market for the rest of time. Oh, no, we don't want this company and ever put him on here. Then what do they do? They put him on in Chicago and they blow him out after six months because they went into a panic. So, you know, I don't disagree, but what am I going to tell you? Like Jim says, Cox sucks. Yeah, go Panthers. OK. We have an open line in date, 750946. That one man did said. And of course, leave it to an expert because if anybody should know about it, spend it all that time in a guy named Shah, who will own a load of the number 51. So, come on. Open line in date, 7509463, one in Broward 524WOD. Nobody cares about this cane closing. Oh, we must get one of those old guys who used to hang around the dog track on it. What's the guy that happened to my life now? I don't want to go all the way up there to Hollywood. The dogs have just about had it. OK. And I just enjoyed the dogs, not a lot, but like, you know, a few times here, I used to enjoy going to the dog track. It's a fun flag. We're still going strong. We love flag. Of course, they love me. I hope they're doing great. Are they? I hope. But some of the paramutes, who's man, they're right on the fence, they're right on the edge because a lot of it has gotten stale. They haven't developed any new people out there. You go out to some of these tracks. It's the same old old people, I guess. Well, why don't they have any new people? Because their people are dying off. They're dying over there. And they don't get any living and breathing. But I'm going to tell you, I'm not going to go through it. It's not even worth it. Because nobody cares. Here's Pemberpines. Hello. Yes, sir. Good morning, sir. Oh, good. A couple of things. First of all, you and Phil Henry are God. Yes. I love listening to the both of you. Well, Adam is in there saying, what about Rick and suds? Adam's right. There you go. Well, they're like God Jr. I mean, how are you guys? Great. Adam, don't sit in there and start like stopping up and down. Because before you were producing that show, you used to say that Rick was an asshole. Okay, so stop. Oh, he says he says I still say that. Okay, thanks, Adam, for your honesty. And what? I was watching a movie, which I had gotten from Columbia House the other day. Yeah. Oh, that reminds me, I have a movie right here. But I'm not going to tell you because you already have the long scene to want this. What is it? See, I'm not going to tell you because then you're going to want it for free. I'm giving it away. Well, uh, disclosure, Michael Douglas and dimming more. I got a copy of it. Good. Okay, thank God. Fantastic movie, too. Okay, that good. Somebody might want it then. It is. It's still wrapped at his plastic. Yeah, it's a great movie. Yeah, I want it. And another one of these were Michael Douglas is pretending to be a sex pod running around Naked. No. Oh, thank God. But he, uh, he makes it with Demi Moore though. But, uh, he tries to do some bites. Okay. Anyway, at the end of this movie, I was watching which was speechless with um, um, bro, what the hell is this thing? Uh, shoot. Shoot? No. Michael, keep. Thank you. Oh, how about Buster Keaton? That's more of my style. No, it was Michael Keaton. Yeah, I can't stand him. And guess what music they used in the movie? Louis Spangel. Yeah. Oh, I did. What a lucky guess in my part, huh? Yeah. And at the end of it, it's got, uh, the video of him doing, uh, the two. No, no, no, say two. No, say two. Yeah. Or say, say two. Take take whatever it is. Yeah. I was through for the first time. It's pretty. Where's that music coming from George? Who's that? I'm not planning it. You're not planning it, are you sure? Yeah. Oh, Danny. You're perfect though. I'm not a favorite song. I do like it though. Oh, I know you like Louis. I go. I love it. Yeah. He's great. I was through for the first time. So they have the whole video on it. The end of the movie? Yeah. Well, they do as they show cuts of the, you know, a part of the movie. And then they show him thinking. Uh. You know what I'm saying? Oh, thank you. Thank you, and Eric. It's beautiful. Yeah. It'll forget about that. That's why I need Sarah Bradley. Thank you so much. Don't have that as a bra. Okay. That's for yesterday. I know, but I just want to make sure we still have a right. Even though it was yesterday, so if they went yesterday, they went to the right place. Go head sir. Yeah. Anyway, I've listened to it. And it's pretty. Although I don't understand. And that forget about understanding man. He's he transcends the language barrier man. He's like universal. Oh, yeah. He speaks a language we can all relate to. Yeah. Very pretty. Right. He's very pretty. Yeah. I know you like that. Yeah. Well, thanks so much sir. That was a major suck up. I wish I had something to give you like a million dollars, but maybe next time. Oh, well. Have a great life. I need an audio. Sorry. I asked to came you'll feed us. Where's my, oh my God. Jesus God. I just dropped Luis on a floor. That's it. I'll never be the same again. Jesus Joseph and Mary forgive me for what I have done. I've sinned and I've dropped my man right there on a floor. Because a hard man is good to find. What does that sound good? I'm not going to play it, but sounds good. Anyway, our kick you went to a Super Bowl contest registration continues today. No number one. A big daddy's in Flatagans in 2505 North University, Robin Hollywood in the one today. Look for the Wild 16 armored truck and register. And then today between five and six of Flatagans. How come I've conquered so long? Because I don't want to reach over to the five down because it's so beautiful. Five to six in Flatagans, Bar and Grill. 2600 West Lady, Boulevard and Fort Lauderdale. Two love Luis. That was tight man. Is that tighter? But you're not there for the best. All right, give it a rest to Leo. So anyway, it's 1038 at Wild. So what is that? The 4000-cone we've had about speechless and the fact that Luis is in there. They know how good thing when they got it. And then that one guy that called me up that day. I don't see what you see in Luis Miguel. I see it. If you ever saw that video that what's the one? I'll find a client there. So if he saw that, he'd understand what I see. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers on Wild here. Not necessarily those of the station or in sponsors.

I love Hank. I'm having a day of fair with Hank. Hello. Randy, I don't hate you at all. Congratulations. Get out of here, Meg. You want to know something? Trimfully, I'm happy for you. Why are you happy for me? Because I am going to my boat. We're going out for cruise. I'm having for the 4.5 years. My first weekend's off. I'm promoting my video. Yeah, yeah. I figured it was some kind of promotion. No, no, no. I'm just saying that I welcome you to the station. Honest to God, I do. Really? Trust me. I'm not lying. I caught a congratulate. Well, Meg, can I just ask you one lousy question there? Why on your last show? Did you say I didn't have a chance in hell of doing anything? Over here, it's up to you. I'm not. I made a mistake. I made a bad call. Damn right. Listening to you. And I think you're fine. And I think it's perfectly okay to have relax and have fun on a weekend. Honest to God. I needed to. Yeah. How's that? And I've been enjoying listening to you. And it's no full. Now. Have a good day. See you. Don't believe word of it, man. Shout here and trash me for a whole afternoon. A whole afternoon. I said, I didn't have a chance in hell. I had no talent. What the hell was I doing here? Boy, Gary made a big mistake. Now she wants to promote something at our tailgate party. She's going to kiss a little butt. Yeah, she's good at it. And of course, she'd probably be on a weekend right now if that hadn't leaked out. Anyway, 1044, W.I.D. so tomorrow. That's just a little sample of hearing the, well, I actually wasn't the worst. I would say that was part of the best of Randy right there. I love that. That was great. That was ballsy sweetheart. But anyway, you know, Nichols got a bug up his answer. We're going to have the worst of Randy from 11 to 2 tomorrow after the, best of Neil or whatever. Whatever it is, okay, it'll be at least something different. And she'll be listening. Here's Hollywood on the purple line. Hello. Hollywood on the pound line. On the purple.

I was the only white person in the restaurant. I was looking for him. It does. It does. But he's standing up giving this Malcolm X. He's looking over me saying how the white man has a press to black man. Pointing at me. Now, mind you. I'm the only white person in the front. Are you better cut it out, man? You better be petting next to the Lord for your forgiveness. You better change the ill of your gay ways. Yeah. Okay. Now, what would happen if a white man walked in there? And gather around with 20 white people saying the black man is called in the problem. What would happen to that white man? Absolutely correct sir. Okay. Thank you sir. See you. Glad we could answer your question. We have an open line of Broward 5249463. And we got one on the purple line. The ATD wireless live pound IoT. So I've already had three people in the building volunteer to sign Bob Greene's name to my paycheck today. See this becomes another part of this ongoing drama. Why does he talk about getting paid? There's not another broadcaster in America who in the history of this business has ever talked about having to go and finagle to get his paycheck every week. Except me. Why do I enjoy talking about it? No, but you damn well better be sure I'm going to continue talking about it until we come up with like some, you know, like regular system. Like, oh, here's where it is. Here's when you get it. Somebody signed it. And yeah, it's just a small detail, but here we're pania surprise. But hey, we like a little bit of suspense. I mean, where am I going until to a clock anyway, right? Exactly. So what's everybody getting all God they've excited about since it is Friday? Here's a four-laterdale. Hello. Neil. Yes sir. Hey, long time listener. First time calling. All right. Hey, we've got a school of criminal given. What is it? We're all friends because we like every day we listen. You had a kind of given. Yeah. Yeah. We're great guy man. So you're just screwing off right? Yeah. Good. We're like, we know you got a little, we're going to have dolphins, you know, up and down, you know, you're lifting it. When we watch them up and down, you know, dolphins never can sit there up and down there. Right. Yeah. What that song says they're up and down there and not. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I can, but you have to, uh, Colonel Given's, uh, same Thomas came up this this Friday. Really, what happened to this? You know, a big game. It's a, you know, consistent game, you know. This Friday. A big game, you know, we play every, like, we're both ranked and we're pretty high. You're ranked? Yeah. I can almost smell it over the phone. You mean like tomorrow night? Yeah. No, come on. Can you get out of two and again, just like two, three, what takes away for the door human? Tomorrow? Yeah. Okay. I will, but just not a good luck pal. I hope you win a game, but you can't say crap on a year. Okay. The guy would just got really bummed out and depressed. And of course, I could understand that because he's waiting for me to go over there and, uh, root, root for the home team or whatever. Okay. Whatever he said. Okay. I'll put a line in Broward 5249463 to Greenline to not participate in it today. And nobody wants to disclose your what Michael Douglas didn't give me more. Oh, where the hell was our reading in the enquiry? What is it? Oh, well, Wayne's going to sign my check tune. How he said. Let's get all the board ops to sign my check and see if it goes through Adam, George, Andy, and Wayne are all going to put their signatures. They're going to put their John Hancock on my check. Okay. Only problem is they all want to put it on the back. That's the problem. Here is, uh, dear field. Hello. Yeah, I would not count on him signing your paycheck to everybody. And by the way, we're just going to be, he's going to be Nashville, Panthers now. What is this guy get off? I'm pissed. You know what I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Well, uh, are you pissed or what? I, I think, I mean, this guy's got some co-honies. Yeah. I think it is before. Okay. Well, let's all stand up and give him a message for the entire town. So I'm like, alright. Two open lines in Broward, five, two, four, nine, four, six, three, five, two, four, WOD, and two on agreed lines, one eight hundred nine, four, four, nine, four, six, three. Nobody wants to disclose you with the, so anyway, I was starting to say that to me more, her mother lives in a car in Vegas. Did you ever hear that story? Her mother's name is Virginia. I heard it this morning. She's a real slut. And she's a slut. She was not going to haul it again five years ago. She's been finally, uh, gave up with her and she couldn't handle it anymore. And the woman is living out of her car. And this slut is making millions and millions of dollars in posing stark naked and, uh, running around, showing off her ample hooters and, uh, whatever it helps she's doing. But in the meantime, her mother, how can you give up on your mother? Even if she is a slut in a miserable old bitch and goes and gets in the drunken brawls and bars and, uh, whatever. And she's living out of a car in Las Vegas, though, less than the desert. She don't even got enough money to go in there and play the nickel slots. And here's the me running around there, second up with every damn thing that's got a, uh, a thing attached to him. Here's a mobile in Miami, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. There's a electric glare, if I something or they got a call dinner, but when happened to McDonald's restaurant. Yeah. Something I'm not a racist either, but, uh, all every time I hear the black man says the white man, a person, they need to look back at facts. Back before the church of the century before he white man is lived any black man. The African themselves would sell their own slaves and prisoners of war. And that is absolutely correct, sir. That's right. So I think they better look in their own backdrop for the point anybody else. I'm not just pointing out that I'm not a racist, but I think we should all look at the fact. Yeah, man. All right, Neil. Okay. See you, buddy. All right, buddy. See you, buddy. Was that jazz? I'll be goddamn boys, boys, your change in Cleveland. I'll be back. Maybe it's that thing on his prostate changes, boys. We have an open line in Broward 524. Well, it does have a tendency. You know, you're kind of like shift your weight and boy, he sure had plenty of it to shift. All of he's gone. So we fire people. So what? 16WIOD. He's my every Ford Latterdale. News, talk, and entertainment radio. 16WIOD. 1106WIOD. You know, this chromium pecculinate business is about to drive me up the wall already. You know, I am so sick and tired. I wish I had never heard of it. Now I got this Bob guy who sends me like facts as pages and pages and pages and pay pages and pages and pages, pages. And he says, I've been listening to all his crap about chromium pecculinate for months and I can't take it anymore. Bob is getting pissed, man. He's getting sick and tired. He's disgusted. He says, I'm a loser. Oh, no. I'm not going to take this anymore. Oh. I've facts to this in 4-2 months ago, but I guess either you didn't get it or just tossed it. I think quite frankly, Bob. I tossed it. As in. Chromium pecculinate is not only poisonous, is it's just playing crap? Please, with 75, isn't it? Please read the attached brochure to get to Stray at School, but of course the attached brochure is like 50,628 pages. Almost. Chromate will give you unbelievable results. There's no comparison between the two. Call me for more info and free samples, Bob. Well, why doesn't he send the free samples over here? Why do we got a column? Why doesn't he send me the free samples? And I'll take him for a couple of weeks if I'm still alive. I'll go in here and say, hey, I'm still alive. Huh? Come on, Bob. Send us the free samples. Send us a bunch of free stuff. We want to be just like the audience so we can relate to him better. Okay? Send us a bunch of free stuff. Okay? Send me my Chromemate right now. And of course, this is like all, you know, he's a distributor of this stuff. So he's got all this stuff in here about this one is good and that one is not whatever. So send it over here, Bob. Now, it's said like about the, you know, 20, 30,000 bottles and samples. And let's give it a shot, even George will pop some. He'll pop anything, even a zit. Here's Hylia, hello. Hey, Neah, how's it going? Okay. I speak at, then we more you're talking about earlier. She was in Letterman last night. She had on this thing that, you know, like her boobs were all out. Yeah. Of course, of course, it was usual. Of course, everybody seen them already. Exactly. Yeah. It was actually put me to sleep. The other thing was about as you can say, how many teams is that I can play for? As the, well, of course, he's all done now, you know, and probably wise pissed off and shoot them up, glory trucks, but he's, so it says he's played for the Indians briefly for about five minutes. And he, let's say, right? He played briefly for the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the A's and St. Louis. Right. Well, not the Indians, the A's and St. Louis. And he, I know he's, he's right out down here for the Marlott. Yeah. Even the Marlott. Even the Marlott didn't want no part of him. He's like that. So like he should own a moving company. Yeah. He better start catching down some of those good steroids as brothers got. He just got no chance. He's already 31. He's over the hill already. Now, I'm just saying he should own his own moving company. He should need anybody to bring him. He's moving all over the damn, then can he just actually right. All right. Take it. You think his brother would be able to afford to buy him is on moving company. But he can afford a gun though. You know, I never forget about two years ago. Somebody faxed me. I, uh, speaking of paychecks. They faxed me a copy of facts of, Oh, Jose can suck those weekly paycheck. Oh, God. 387,000 dollars. For one week. I had a story once where we, uh, the quarterback for the Patriots, uh, Bloodsup. Yeah. He took his car and for repair. And, uh, the repairman was a sooner round as car. And he hit the visor and helped pop that a check for a hundred thousand dollars. He had it just, you know, hooked up in the visor of his car. He immediately called Bletson. They, you know, we got this check for a hundred thousand. There he goes. Now, and it's put it back up there. And like he's answering the person I bought, it needed. He's only going to make 42 million. What do you worry about? What's 100,000, man? You know, when you got millions and millions, just figure out the interest you're making. Like even in a bank, we're still put their money in like a regular bank. But I mean, even if five percent you're making out pretty damn good. It is. All right. Okay. Have a great life, pal. Oh, nobody wants to smooth me. Thank God. We can milk that. We can pretend all day. That's our big thing. I've been to the police. Ooh. The thing is, I was there a Texaner.

to like spread this to every radio station every newspaper I make some of the sports writers might pick up on it that's right let's start hitting Wayne in the pocket and show them that we think he can take all stuff when he could have his ass would it be something if we were able to prevent that team from moving yes all right okay do it and you got a bunch of backers behind all right pal bye bye yeah I'm looking behind me they're all behind me they're like several yards thank goodness but that is a good idea until we get like our arena until we get some promise that the Panthers are staying here we're not gonna get jerked around that is if you got any of those forms to renew your Marlin tickets your dolphin season tickets for next year I just kind of hold it out you know went and doubt hold it back hold it out I mean I can't influence all that many people obviously because I'm trying desperately to fill up that goddamn arena for just one game would be nice okay for hockey I mean to basketball people well I got that seven foot 10 freak on here for a million dollars and it got the coach with a slick back here so right away the first game was a sellout although even that game was not a sellout until they uh till game day till game time they I my dentist told me he walked up and bought tickets right at the box or a facade game day how do you like that for a heat game I'm opening day but because they had made the big trade just a day before so naturally all the hype about it they were able to solve the first game and last night I did look pretty jam packed there's about 30 seconds of it and talk to a people who were there but but according to the paper this morning there were like a few hundred empty seats and it wasn't you know it was not a sellout for sure but just one hockey game would be so great that we could sell it out and just you know but I you know I've done everything I can and the meantime that guy's guys are a great idea and I'm all for it and I'll do whatever it takes okay just to give it back to wait there you go Wayne right in your post here's Miami hello Miami is gone can't be in posty play when is Diaz the last bitch they're partaking around in the back there do you hear it you lose open line in date 751 Wild and on the green line 1-800-944 so tomorrow first hour best of Neil second than through the from 11 to 2 the worst

place and you know obviously since I won't be supporting blockbuster video anymore you know I'll have to have something to watch on my VCR right that's a good excuse and I get a suggestion for Wayne besides sucking my Brian Cox I'd like him to bulldoze that wasted time blockbuster video games and golf okay it's a rip off it's a joke and it also way it's like a savage and the people are driving

Well that's right because man that you know if he looks down on you if he frowns on it man you got a big problem. I know and I figured you got it right in with Brian. He's got a big mouth and loose lip sync shifts. That's what Brian said. Couldn't believe it though. Number one for hanging out in the locker room. That's right. That one pressed the other guys.

That was on entertainment tonight last night. Entertainment last night. According to Adam. And they had a thing on air about O.J. Of all things that had come to fight out that O.J. saw that movie Breathless and became. It wasn't breathless. Was it that's not what the guy said before. You're wrong. That's not the name of the movie. You jackass. It begins. It's like speechless. Sleepwalk. It's not breathless. George. What is the correct name of the movie? That's not it. Speechless. I'll spare you. Speech, breathless. Oh my god. Why is everybody calling in here thinking this is the coast today? What do they want? I mean, inside lines, the top lines. All the ways. On 97.3. The coast. The sea. I'm telling you, they might have a lot of things. I'm telling you, they might have a lot of things. They might have an audience if they put his ass on there or tell you that. So anyway, speechless. And O.J. saw the movie and then he got fast that it would Luis Miguel. He was having a concert. I guess wherever O.J. was like maybe in LA. And O.J. tried to get like some freebies and he got shine twice. They had two different concerts. He tried to get in like free passes and backstage and the whole day. And a shine does that say, get out of here. Oh, I love Luis even more now than ever before. You know what I'm saying? I know you're a good guy. I'm not a boy, Luis. Don't hang out with us like this.

We're going to be flying a thing over. The annual nose picking parade in the parade. Here's four-laterdial, hello. Good afternoon, Neil. When is top of this, amigo? Come on, Mr. Doesn't this country have any memory about Bob Doll that he single-handedly lost the election for Jerry Ford back in 76? That is absolutely correct, sir. I mean, he is an embedded loser. He is a born loser, and he's a professional loser, and he's a chronic loser. I know, and he, I'll tell you, I need to scare you. In addition to which being a very old man who like goes with a win, whichever way, and of course now that the right wins got to hold him, he is sufficiently being the super-moralist and dictating what's going to be on TV, and who's going to watch this and becoming a real radical board again right-winger in this group. Well, yeah, we would be a military state. Right. What do you mean, the most dangerous person out there right now? He's one. One of the most dangerous people. One of the most dangerous people. He's not quite Bob Dornin and Pat Buchano, but he's getting close. Yeah, I just want to pass the word on him. Okay, pal. Okay, Neil, boss. Yeah. Rest in peace, pal. Don't worry about it. No problem. Bob Doll, a born loser, be a landslide. So anyway, we got, what's his name is on there? Cole and Nick. Cole is Nick. Nick has still got to sure it on, but that'll come off. He's got a schmoth on his head. Nick with a schmoth on his head. That's right. They're working out out there on the farm, maybe they're like, built in a few. Look at that. Nick is the be in the tall boy. That's a cute thing. Here's Miami. Hello. Yes. She and me into calling you after months that I got a free tape from you. Yeah. Thank you. For what? What I give you? One of your Columbia house, Ted. Oh, great. It wasn't any good? Yeah, it's great, Phil. How do you like that? And I bet George was very efficient and you got it in just like a couple of days. Oh, he wanted was personal vital information. There you go. Shoot size? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I can say as you're welcome. Thank you, sir. And have a great life. Thank you. Okay. So he didn't have anything to say except thank you. But there's something nice about Sam. Thank you. Like somebody really cares as opposed to most of the freebies that we give away. Nobody even ever bothers to call say, thank you. We really enjoyed it in a great time. There are a few who do like to tickets to the game and stuff like that. Like maybe one out of every 10. And the rest of them that's like, well, what are we getting now? That was pretty good. But what do we got now? Huh? Here's a lady in plantation acres. Hello. Hi, Neil. Finally. Yes, man. Okay. I met you a couple of times at the game and I got to give you a spy report from the Marlins who we used to be seasoned ticket holders. They're going to be calling my house. Yeah. And I got this guy named Andy Major on the phone. He's a funny, new everything about everything. Yeah. And he's giving me a whole big argument because I tried to explain to him that in business, that anybody's in business and they have a lot, especially somebody in high-zingers position. You know, he's not losing anything. What are the ones who paying for his losses and his tax write-offs? The guy's giving me a whole hard time saying, I don't know what I'm talking about. And that he's really upset that the hockey's leaving. And the whole, oh, my yards for a half an hour. He's trying to keep me on the phone to renew the Marlins tickets. And I tell them, get it. We're having a petition going around the arena tonight for everybody who has season tickets to any other high-zinging of homings. And we're going to try to get everybody to find it. Oh, I love it. Great. And by the way, did you get your toilet fixed? I'm still waiting for Izzy. You know, he's a little bit slow. Because my husband does that. We live right near you in the acre. Well, stand by because if Izzy don't get his act together the next few days, I may have to give him a call. Okay. You want me to leave my notes? No, you, I'll, I'll let you know. Okay. Very good meal. And three times a week. Okay. Good luck on that thing. That's a great idea. Okay. We're going to work on it. Good for you. Good for you. Great. See ya. Bye. There he goes. Somebody's taking a ball by the horn. Are they taking a ball in their hand? We can't keep his packer in his pants. Oh, my God. Some days, everything takes more time than you expect. Fortunately, dinner doesn't have to be that way. Because in 30 minutes or less, you can put together a beef dinner. Your family will think to a cow was to prepare. That's why it all means house the kids are studying their field a little crazy. That's the wolfing down that chilly man. And across town the Bradford's are gathered round the toilet bowl, vomiting up the last of their beefy and gelatinous. And even now, Ben and Carole Baker are thinking about that funny tasting meatloat they have put in there while they're being rushed in an ambulance to the emergency room with a worst stomach cramps of their lives. You see, in 30 minutes or less, you may be able to put together a beef dinner. But given all the prep time involved, you won't have time to actually cook it. Raw beef and he could lie. It's what's her dinner. 20-till-one at WIOD day-deline opener. If you jump on a quickly-man, if you're really moved fast, maybe 7-5-1-9-46-3-7-5-1-WIOD. Here's Boca, hello. Boca.

Hi, this is Gary from Boston, the hockey coach. Yes, Gary. Oh, hey. Okay. Did the hockey jersey fit? Did it fit? Yeah. And then some. Quick analysis of the Huzzinga thing. What is really missing a bow-none is the kid. What do you mean what he's missing the bow-none? Do you think he cares about that? Yeah, well that's... He doesn't care about that. It's amazing if you can see the influence that he has on the kids. Well, the team has on the kids. They've got everything from the hats, the shirts. Right. Like about hockey all the time. That's right. He don't care. That's amazing. Well, one, two, a constantly hello. Sorry, not going to get the games, and I heard early that he can be out of town. Right. But we'll see you at some points hopefully soon. I'll stop by, say, hello, and have a good vacation. Okay. Well, tell the kids, Wayne says he's sorry. All right. Okay, bye. He's the great, so it's still hockey, baby. That's Wayne for you. So what were you saying about that woman that called before? We have an open line in the green lines that if there's anything... Now, if you're getting somebody up there's going to call him like, say anything. Or even make a gutterl sound. 1-800-944-9463. You people in Palm Beach, man. The biggest punch of losers I have ever seen in my life. Sorry. Sorry as... But when the passion bitch is on it... Oh, Aaron, I don't know. I've got this very tiny penis and everybody laughs at me.

That was me. You don't have to feel bad. You got a lot of company. Yeah. Yeah. And that's it. W-I-O-D. Here's another thing. Let's do a mobile in Miami. Yeah. Yeah. How you doing, buddy? Okay. Let's say, and I'm pissed off about losing the pants or two, but that's not going to stop me from going to the game to rest of this year. No, I mean, I don't know if you're suggesting that. Nobody is suggesting that. Sure. No one is suggesting that. We're not going to abandon the pants just because of God damn Wayne High Pingo. I think they're really playing over their head. And I think they got a chance to show a lot of people. That's because they got a great coach who can motivate these guys. And really put a spark onto the rest. Look, we did for Niedermär Manis. Kid was asleep until Doug McLean got here. Really? He worked nice guys up. He used to look at the bench from before. This was like a morgue over there. Now it was really good. Especially the coaches to stand there with that wrinkled up. Push you never know if it was a mannequin or the real thing. Yeah. I wanted to thank you for the tickets. So, for the last game. Fire game. It was great. That was a good one to be there. Yeah. It was a dynamite third period. It was a little bit. It was electrifying.

No one be had what you could almost break away and got pulled down. Why wasn't that a penalty shot? He used just got through saying it almost to break away. Almost. Okay. Almost on the counts and horseshoes and quits. So you have to have a couple of steps on the different ones. They have to have like a full step.

Maybe we can send shoelace to Nashville. Hey, that sounds even better. Got another question for you. He'd be good up there. He'd be good all country boy, huh? He can pick it with the best of them. No, they won't like him. He's to quiet. Question for you. Yeah. I heard, um, our Emma Fud. There's something I think was, uh, no Henry. Emma Fud with a rabbit. Oh, that was not on fuel Henry. Were they on you? Yes. I like old Harry's playing Elmer Fud with a Wab. It's Phil Henry. Don't play that stuff. Were they you? That was me. Wow, it was great. I thought it was so Henry there. That was great. And I hear it. So, in other words, it was great. You thought you hear our Phil show, but if it was just okay, you thought you would hear it on the show. That was what you're saying. Well, no. I mean, that sounds like a real backhanded compliment. It sounds like I've fist up my butt as what it sounds like. No, sounds like you're just sticking in there and twisting it around and tearing my guts out. You forced to fart. No, you don't. You're just saying that because you want to hear that damn Wab it thing. Yeah, I really do. Oh, you'll hear it. Thanks, Lyle. See a pound. Okay. Phil says you're a suckhold. We have an open line in day, 7509, 463. It was really good. So I think I must do it on a Phil Henry show, right? Phil is great, though, by the way. Let me say it again, in case anybody missed it earlier. The fact that Hank Goldberg might be all though. He doesn't believe it. He just says it to try to like cover up. But if he did ever believe that he could compete. I'm not talking about numbers, bogus, a few diaries here. I'm talking about over the long term or just based on sanity, on rationality, on anybody judging ability and talent and humor and anything that they're doing on here. If he really believes that he can compete with Phil Henry, this man is in Lyle Landman. He couldn't lick Phil Henry's bald spot this guy, this fat slob. What a joke. And he's on there talking about, well, I had this number. Yeah, you got a number, I'll write, pal. And I think it's about up. Here's Opelaka. Hello. Are you on it with Opelaka?
