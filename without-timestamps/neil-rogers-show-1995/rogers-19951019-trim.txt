Yes, you're kidding, because there's at least a hundred million dummies out there. And I think most of them are listening to us. Don't forget Phil Henry, two to six to seven. I'm going to start promoting the goddamn Phil Henry show. Or did you, well, I'm telling you, I did. I went on for like an hour about that two to three hour yesterday. I'm going to promote this man. I'm going to stand on my hand. I'm going to do cartwheels. I'm going to buy my own billboards out there just to promote Phil Henry, because it's beneficial to all of us, because there might be a little sloppover. In fact, we would have thought since the passion between up just a hair at night, I can't say, what kind of hair? She went up a little hair at night. So there'd be some sloppover from that. She wouldn't just think just a little. Good. Good. Onor, Bert, I'll clean it up. So anyway, it's 12.07 at WOD. Everybody in the building can curse. They wasted like a million and a half bucks on Howard and Chicago with the same company that if we have a cart machine that's broken, well, we can't be bothered with that and here because we're building a new building. And if you live long enough, we might be in there. Wouldn't that be great if we were in that new building right now and Hollywood? Oh, God would that be a beautiful thing. Here's a lady on South Beach, hello. Neil. Yes, man. Hi. I'm coming out of the woodwork. You're coming out? Yes. OK. I just got back. I've been in Los Angeles for two months. And I was there when the verdict was read. Were you on a jury? No. No. But do you know Kato has his own radio station out there? His own radio station. But he's on a show. Radio show, yeah. Radio show. Isn't that sad? It's sad. The photo is just showing us. Man. Yeah. Very popular. They're into him. They're into him. Yeah. Based on what? I don't know why he fits out there. He's like that burnt out surfer look. But everybody's like that out there. Right. Exactly. And then all my God. Right. And I came back here and there's nothing here either. Right. So. I don't think Los Angeles and Miami are like the two hotspots right now. No. Well, I was like, oh, they don't have the parrot jungler out there. So we got that up on. They don't have a sky up on it. They don't have a sky up. No, they count or blimp. Or blimp. Or blimp. They don't have the good your blimp. But I mean, it was, but there's nothing here either, Neil. I mean, this is a very dying town. You're a kid. No, why? I know you know. But I'm a young vital woman. And I don't know what to do. I'm a young vital woman. Right here at T, we could find a lot of guys. Young vital guys out there would keep you busy like 20 hours a day at least. Well, I know. I've been listening to your show for years. And if they're like, guys, I could listen to your show. I don't know what to do. You don't know what to do with them? No. Well, maybe they give you a little instruction. Maybe. Okay. Take it easy, Neil. See you at one of our appearances. Doug, your team will line up for you. Yeah. All right. Well, maybe I will come because I never go to any of your things. There, there you go. Come to one of my things. Okay, maybe. Okay, sweetheart. Bye. Bye. She's going to come to one of our things. We're going to have like a gang bang right there right in the middle of the mall. What's wrong with that? She sounds like she's cooperative. She's looking for a little excitement in her life. She's tired of all these deadbeat places like LA and Miami. God, go somewhere it is like a little bit of action. It's your right here. 751, we do have the Pirate Jungle. God. See, that call was really better than any call that Phil had yesterday. And it's only way, not as funny, but really better because that was the epitome of what these people think. These perocular little people have never been more than two blocks from Deadland. Here's Papino. Hello. Wait a minute. Like I said, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, I did see that thing on our race. That's right. That's just, I don't know what to say about it's a disgrace. I mean, this kind of stuff, you know, it goes on all the time. And the only time we ever hear about it is if it's somebody, you know, happens to somebody's fame and it's caught up with it. I mean, here's a guy who was a black guy who evidently was, you know, well, dressed. He was driving a Jaguar, not a deadbeat. He was driving through a white neighborhood and, you know, black guy to white neighborhood that said, old story. They're still doing a black guy over. And then what happened? They probably pulled them over. You know, they started giving him a hard time. Yeah. And he was talking about it. Right. And it was like three of them and one of him. Yep. And he's dead. Yes, it's sad. I mean, you know, where's this kind of where, where, how far we come. You know, I mean, sure black aren't slaves anymore. You know. And see, all these people that were so whipped up talking about the Ferrocont March and talking about the OJ thing, all it is is lip service because they don't really give a crap. They don't care. Right. I mean, it's like, I, you know, I'm a little concerned about, but, you know, it's just, you know, it's the fact, you know, blow over and then I'll forget about it. They make it into a big media circus. And then people pretend that they give a crap, but as soon as that's over with, uh, well, let's see, what are we going to her all day? What's Jenny Jones got on, you know, what's the next thing that we can sync our teeth and do? Right. I mean, I'm concerned about, but, you know, what can I do? What am I going to do about it? I mean, it's just tough. I don't know what. Yeah. What can you say? Go out of the passport office. Be a good idea. Hey, and just in case. The Phil Henry's thing yesterday was great. And I heard you say you want to start a promote and a malad. I just, I was wondering if you could play that Phil Henry song you have. Which one is that one? That's our town manager told me. Yeah. Oh, what is that college, George? That Phil thing. That thing's great. Oh, Phil's twisted. Yeah. Okay. Okay. You just got it. Open line of dates. Five, one, one, and a Broward. Five, two, four. What is this thing? Yeah, but let me say something for, let me say something. All right. All right. All right. Okay. But the, um, did you, uh, are you, are you sure? Yeah, but wait a second. All right. There it is. Just a little preview of the Phil Henry show from 2 to 6. Got your hockey tickets here. Phil, that's your reward for doing that great hour between 2 and 3 yesterday. And the tip off on his town, like that woman was asking what's this all about. The article about Margaret and Phil, it's in the, uh, Harold living today section on page 80. There's a sentence in here that should give you an idea. It says we should let you know, uh, we think Margaret is in disgrace. Apparently, however you don't. Enough of you tune into make Henry show 2 to 6 p.m. weekdays, one of the top rated English language talk shows in South Florida. Where else in the United States of America, could you find a newspaper column about a radio guy and it would say he shows one of the top rated English language shows in South Florida. Stop and think about it. Ponder it. But player, but I'm practicing in the afternoon. I listen to Phil Henry 2 to 6 on Wild. He keeps the uplifted informed and stood. It was a real Henry 2 to 6 p.m. on news, talking entertainment radio. 610 WIEOD. No filament is Hank Goldberg, the明 is U.P. Foltomo. The manager told me that I was right out of my head. And then he said, Bill Henry was using a voice instead. Such lies. I didn't listen to his chie. I knew all along. He was all wrong. And I knew that he thought. Are you sure that I was crazy, but I'm not home. No. Yeah, but wait a second. The manager told me that I was a little confused. And I said, hey Bobby. Yeah. I didn't call to get abused this week. I heard a show just the other day. I think you ought to know what he did on his show. I was very up all. That's the reason why I called. Yeah, but let me say something first. Let me say something. This woman named Margot calls you so quite a lot. And I don't want to listen to that suck up post. Not I know you think Bill is a genius. And that is okay to feel that way, but you would I say. I didn't think it was a bit funny. Especially when he talked about the abortive babies. It says, with the cocktail sauce on top. Yeah, but, all right, did you, are you, are you sure? The manager told me that I could use some couch time, but I should have made me. Yep. You'd let me speak my mind. You'll find. I didn't think it was very kind. One baseball was played by the crippled and blind, and to make matters worse. Again. Passion falls with sunny hush. Oh no. All right, all right. The manager told me. Yeah. That I was right out of my head. And then he said, lady, you're too easily misled. Because you should know Bill Henry shows you need can to you. So why don't you relax and have a value more to? Because you don't know if you've got to talk to Bobby Green or not. And you know three voices are better than one. You sound of a bet. Probably a teenage WIDC lunch ban is here with our lunch today, which is outstanding from Stan State's Delhi where they got great stuff. They got all the adkins stuff. They got these special hot dogs. And they got the cheese cake. And they got great stuff. We love Carol. We love Stan. We love the Adelaide. Okay. We love everybody. We love the lunch ban. Two open lines in date. 7509463751WWD. Even Andy's finagling free lunch every day. Here's a lady in Hollywood. Hello. Yes, man. Now you were just asking for some women that were sitting out there doing absolutely nothing. And I'm working. I just wanted to go ahead and call you. Well listen at Grants. I answered my plea. I answered your plea. Great. Well, what do you want to talk about? O.J. or anything that tickles your fancy. Did you wear you impressed by the fact that O.J. didn't attend his birthday or his daughter's birthday party? I think it's absolutely disgusting. If he claims to be such a good father, and all this, and he's not only that he didn't attend, but the fact that he was out there with his Paula one last night. It's cool and around. Yeah. It's absolutely disgusting. But it's not even a claim that the grandparents didn't want to let him have the kids. I haven't heard that anywhere either. But he doesn't even have a defense in that respect. Right. So I would regard to the Paula woman hanging around with him. Yeah. I agree with the Paula this morning that in the work of food that she is safe. Peace out, Grants. Are you sure? I'm positive. Yeah. Well, there's nothing positive in this world, right? Yeah. There's a lot of talk about him moving to another country. And I mean, Panama City, that's close to another country. But there is a lot of talk that they want to pick up and move to a foreign country, because he can't escape all the duration of year in all the psychosis. And of course, if he can't escape it anywhere, I mean, this was worldwide. Yeah. So I don't think they paid too much attention. A lot of other places you'd be surprised. Didn't really care that much. So it really wasn't that important. The only thing is going out of proportion. So if she passes him off, if he catches her screwing around, they might just be hopping out of plain. That's why I always carries that passport. Yeah. That's probably true. Yeah. But I still think if she's if they stay here, she's safe. Because he's got to prove to the world that he is squeaky clean. Yeah. He's a, wouldn't you think that after they spent all that money and they got him off that he would, that would be satisfactory. But instead, it's like he's still trying to prove it. Like he denies that we don't believe it, but in his mind, he knows none of us believe it. Yeah. Now let me tell you something. I don't believe he didn't do it. All right. I've probably, I believe he probably did do it. Yeah. But I do agree that it because of the system the way it set up now. Dad. Because it sucks, yeah. Which it sucks. And I work with the system, so I know it better than maybe some other people. And I still think it was a good verdict because it shows that reasonable doubt does work. So let's assume he hadn't done it. And everything was planning in his direction. Yeah. At least he got off. And there was some result out just because of the evidence. Now I do believe he probably did it. Yeah. That was a good verdict. It was a good verdict, even though it's probably not the truth. Okay. And of course the tabloid shows agree with it because if he wouldn't have got off, they would have no material now. Right? It's true. Okay. Have a great day. See you. Bye. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good. Good.

Yeah, they're starting to the right wingers. It wasn't bad enough. They found sex in the cloud in that movie. Then they got all been out of shape now because the Disney people want to extend those benefits to their gay employees, which is almost everybody works for Disney anyway. And we have a handful of these right wing, goody two shoes, legislators here in the state of Florida. Right away to one who like Boycott Disney, they're having an interest breakdown. There are two colors are showing. Okay, and here's Dutch land Uber allows playing in a goddamn background. How come I can't find that cart mister? Huh? See every time something becomes popular, every time I play something that people like. You sound of a bitch. All of a sudden it starts showing up all over the place like Rick asked me yesterday to play the reputation contas. I can't believe he even asked me that. On the one hand, he's telling me about all these people who have come here like Joey and Randy and all these other people he's mentioning, who have tried to rip me off and stole a my material and how that's bad and it hurts the station and it weakens the show and it dilutes my material. And then he turns around and wants to play the goddamn reputation contas. See this is the one I got this evening. Go! Letting it. Delani. Go Shaunot. Treffa. Dior Italia. Go Brasil. See that's like, well, that's good though. That's a shortened version. Because that other one goes on. It's like a shortened version. Here's Pembroke Pines on a purple line. Hello. I'm Colneal. Yes sir. Hey, we're Jackie Baill. Jackie Baill. Hey, she's in her kayak. That's Jennifer. What is this story on that? Does anybody know if you heard any rumors? Can we make up a good story? What's the deal with that? I don't know. There was a bad fight. I think that's it. I think somebody scratched their somebody's post. Hey, I'm on the acting of the diet. Yes? I'm going on two weeks now. I've lost eight pounds. Oh! I was at two, 40, I'm down to two, 21, but I lost some pounds before I went on it. Okay. Am I doctor? Am I head start? I went to my doctor yesterday and told me I need to get off the plane. I need to get off that diet. Oh yeah. Get off that diet. Yeah. You're going to kill yourself. Right. You know what I would tell him? That's what I would tell him. Save a lot of people too. Hey, we said it could cause kidney problems all that fat. But I mean, what if I died anyway? The way I'm meeting him. We read the book. But I'm not eating the carbohydrates. But I'm not loading up on fat. Right. And plus if you drink a lot of water. These people are nice. They were their diet sodas. Drink a lot of good bottled water, man. Get yourself some salais, some avion, some periay. Good bottled water. And just when it's not flush it out, I got to have to worry about that. You bottle of zephyr hills and I keep filling it up at work. There you go. That's what I do. And plus that'll help you lose the weight faster too. Yeah, we're all that's what I'm saying. Note since I cut out the doctor peppers. I mean, down. I mean, my girlfriend's saying, why you can drink the diet. Capping free coke. I mean, I cut out the doctor pecker man. I'm telling you get rid of that. What's the use? Yeah. Anyway, I just want to tell you, I love your show. Thank you very much for the diet. I waited a while before I went on and told other people that I know. To let you find a few people who still are alive like this. Just come with skepticism. I mean, you know, it sounded like, you know, it's fast backwards from every other type of diet you hear about. Right. So I was skeptical. I've met, but, you know, I want to know, I'm in the first two weeks. I'm just about to get out of it. When can I start eating like the reduced carbohydrate passes at Lorenzo's? Uh, down the road. Down the road. Exactly. Yeah. Because that's still got a pretty hefty amount of carbs in it. Don't, you know, when you lose, how much you got to lose? I want to get down to 180. How much you weigh now? So you used to go about 40 pounds to go. So don't, don't push too many of the carbs in there. You know, all depending on how fast you lose it. Just ease back into what more vegetable salads, you know, stuff like that before you start adding too many other things. All right. I know this thing that book told me. Yeah. It told me that I may have like a literally a yeast infection. Right. That's right. Right. I've been taking those garlic pills. Yeah. I stomach is actually, I mean, it was before it's like rounded. Now I have a little flatness going there. There you go. Dr. Acton's is the second God. Acton's is God. Okay, pal. I love you, buddy. Yep. Neorodger saves soft Florida. But of course, Melissa Rodriguez here. We don't know nothing about that. All she knows is we had a crappy book in the King of Talk is like down to 4.6, which is a 5. Something between 10 and 2. Which guess what's we'd art that ain't so bad? We never do below a 5. Sure, 25. 54 in midday. Here we'll be okay. They won't like get to nervous. I'll go easy. They don't come back to work tomorrow. Oh, these people in the media in this town. You are so bush league. You are so paranoid. You are so tiny. Tiny. Even my dog ain't this tiny. Even my number. Even my number ain't that tiny. Close. When they get knocked around, champion's not right back. Not just because it's a long, because not all because of long, because it's not a demon. If they're lost, then mind me golfing balls. If they've had a piece of everything. They get knocked out. They get up and knock somebody else. It's time to knock. Golfing's on radio. I used talking entertainment radio. 16 WIOD. Hey, deal. Fuck you. You son of a bitch. Okay, 1239. I got the two things here. Okay. It's for one good and one bad. So, George, who called me before I did get your facts. And it's kind of cute. Lance Edo sidebar and grill. And it's got like souped as you're he. Aegis for one year, maybe bitter. Keto salad and empty head. Let us with very little dressing. Ron Goldman wine, young vintage. Good body, but you have to bring your own glasses. Paula Barbeare, cocktail, OJ, with little honey on the side. Goes down real easy. Marsha Clark Beer, we thought we still had a case but now we're not sure. Simpson, Alibis sandwich, full of baloney and hard to swallow but lots of stupid people are buying it. Mark Furman Chicken Platter, absolutely no dark meat. Vio Alana Cool, well battered and sliced served without the head. And the Dennis Fung played, grilled detective served open-faced, maybe contaminated, dessert it's sorry our bakery is temporarily closed, lawyers have taken all the dough. Cute, thanks George. So anyway, here's something I held a lot less cute and a lot more disgusting and grow test and I even hesitate to read it but it's from his writers, it's a new story. Chicago, an a-tonation of his law minister, Louis Ferrican, has said that Jews should go to hell and be prepared for war. The Chicago Tribune reported on Monday. I say to Jewish America, get ready, knuckle up, put your boots on because we're ready and the war is going down. The newspaper quoted, Canal X, National Youth Minister for the Nation of Islam is saying. The real deal is this, he said, black youth do not want a relationship with the Jewish community or the mainstream white community or the foot-shuffling head-bouling knee-bobbing black community he added. Oh, the so-called Jew is a parasite who comes into our community and takes our trailer and tracks the loads of money on a daily basis he says. The comments were made prior to the Eriali Center tonight in Washington and Vance of the Mondays Million Man March. The reporter, the only white at the meeting was later tossed out. The story said, Canal told the cheering rally, all you Jews can go straight to hell. Hey, new, fuck you. Oh, there you go. The newspaper also said, Mohammed, in the interview, said a president Clinton leaving town to give a speech on race relations, it seems opportunistic for the cracker to go now when God's man is in town, meaning Faracad. Of Mondays March, he said, this is the time of the black man's rise and the white man's demise and what a surprise. How do you like that? So all you people that are defending the march and people associated with it and all the other who are full of crap, okay? And I'm going straight to hell. Here's for a lot of deal, hello. Hello? Yes, sir. How are you guys doing today, though? I heard all the crazy wild topics because Shane, they all are also concerned about this trial when it's just over. It's over. It's done. It's first, first. They don't want to let it go, man. They don't want to let go. It's a shame they just have nothing better. Did you ever get anything like that? It was so good you didn't want to let go. It is first, fair, consultal marches involved, all I could say is all I'm missing is a little court, court 45. Yeah. Other than that. Okay, cute. Okay, see you at the Cranker, Crank rally. That's what Tom Brokjow said. Open line of Broward, 524Wild, D1 on the Green Line, 1-800-944-9463. Beautiful comments there by Louis Furracans, AIDS. But of course, that was only as A to said that Louis would never say that what he sure would and did and does. Here's Miami, hello. Anyhow, you're done. Okay. Hey, listen, quick question. Yeah, first of all, let me tell you. First time, call a long time, listen. Great. Isn't she? I was just thinking about, you know, a comparison of what his A to said. About what Furracans said, what do you make of him wanting to meet, say with all the heads of the Jewish community or state? Whenever in the Godfather, how they wanted to have the meeting with a head of the five families, yeah. And they all like came out in a box. You never come out the way you went in. Right. That's right. Listen, what is with the fabulous sports babe? Yeah. Where did she come from, Mike? All right. She comes from a goddamn pickup truck somewhere. Yeah, Lisa sounds like one of these six that you see at the side of the fire cracker 400. Yeah. And to truck stop. Driving her diesel truck. Oh, gosh. She is horrendous. Yeah. Well, that's QAM for you, man. And they got a guy on overnight who makes who makes her sound sensational. A guy who just screams and yells, say pretty soon they'll have nothing but syndicated programming on that station. And all that has his laridass in all the rest will be like zero. They'll have no number. I'm Tonya. Hey, no. Who do you like him? Who do I like? Go Braves, baby. Go the way. Kick some ass. Okay, pal. See you later. Yeah, go Braves. I want those Braves for straight. I don't want to pick on those poor Indian fans. They've been dying for years and years. But Jane, it's going to be there. They're going to be shopping. They're going to be waving. They're going to be doing their thing in the way. Straight. Hey, Neil. Fuck you. Okay, enough already. 12.4, we have an open line in day. But this is a good lunch. The sausage. Mm-hmm. And no carbs. Zero carbs. No carbohydrates. You can have like a whole bunch like I'm having right now. And one on a green line, 1-800-944-WIOD, is a lady in plantation. Hello. Yes. Hi. I love you, by the way. Of course. I'm on the asking. Right. I'm having a problem with, uh, I have the book. But I am doing the test at night. And it's purple. You know, the pretty brown. Not real dark though, I hope. No, no, no. It's, uh, medium. That's good. Now, the problem is I'm not losing any weight. How long have you been on it? Uh, this is going to be my second one. I'm going to be my second week. No. Yeah. Can you have a lost anyway? I would say two pounds at the most. Really? Yes. And, you know, I just had a baby though, about six months ago. Yeah. But I don't know what I'm doing wrong. And I've read the book over and over again. I mean, they've got it. How much do you have to lose? Um, I'd say about 15 pounds. Well, it's going to be slow, see? If you only got 15 to lose all together and you've already lost a couple, it's going to be slow. But if you stick with it, I, I pretty much guarantee it's going to happen. You might be real resistant like a lot of a say I'm too. So I'd stick with it. It took me about a week to get into the, uh, into the circle. Right. Yeah. So you're real resistant. So you just got it. You got to stick with it. That's all be patient. Should I, should I go on a lower fat? Because I've been eating. But my appetite is really not great now. You know, it's good. Yeah. That's great. See, I told you on this diet, you're not hungry all the time. I know. And I go to Lorenzo too. There you go. Oh, it's wonderful. Don't eat more than three or four of those cheesecake today. That might be holding your back. No, no, no, I haven't even had one a day. Good. But they are great though. Oh. I, I would just stick with it. It'll happen. Trust me when I tell you. Okay. Stick with it. Okay. Keep it on. See you. Yeah, it slows down for a lot of us. I'm down to a crawl. But I'm not worried about it. Because my this morning, I get up. My blood sugar is 98. 98 with no medication. All right. Nice. Outstanding. And a blood pressure was like a hundred over 60. And my medication is like way down or fraction of what it was before. And I still got about 25, 30 pounds, 35, maybe to go. But what the hell? So a big deal. It'll happen. And let me tell you another thing. The longer you take to lose it, the longer you're going to keep it off. I know that's an old cliche and raw inpatient. But if you get out one of these quack things and it was like 40 pounds in five minutes, you're going to gain it back just like Oprah. You're going to be like a goddamn accordion. You know what I'm saying? I'm going to be fat one day skinny the next like a balloon that accidentally who the hell wants that. That's very unhealthy too, by the way. So just take your time and eat your steaks in your lobster and your, that can cheesecake and have a great life. 610 WIOD. Set people with power tools. And now language lab.

You're welcome. Okay, 1251 at WIOD. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Hello? Yes, sir. How are you doing? The oldest is this is our first time caller. Okay. I'm calling up in response to the, all the negativeism that the OJ and I don't E.O.J. trial right Mr. Louis Farron, what is it with this individual? You know, I'm an American first of all. I don't go back to my roots or whatever. I was born in Philadelphia. Yeah. My dad's Italian. My mom's ethnic Puerto Rican. They came here. They assimilated. They wanted to become Americans and they were successful. What is with what up with this idiot because apparently he doesn't know what. Worth ethics is all about hard work. What do they want to continue to have handouts, handouts, and to them become, continue to be social parasites. There's a big part getting up working. Yeah. And being responsible for all black people are social parasites. Is that what you're saying? Well, we're not saying, and you want to generalize it here. But the way he is actually referring to is that the white establishment is the culprit of everything. Give me a break. Yeah. That's ludicrous to think anything like that. Uh-huh. That is ludicrous. That's my opinion and continue to work. We need more people in this community believe me. I've been here two years. I don't know what to do. I'm here because I've got. I recently was transferred. I worked with the department of justice. I called it in justice many of times because of the things I see. But we need to continue to be more vocal and hospital because we need to get things straight and out in this country. All right. Okay. Bye-bye. Zygazon. I'm sorry. We have an open line in day 751. You sound of a bad guy. 9463751 W. I got to stop eating the rest of that sauce. That sauce is good. But I know there's some carbs in there. You're not fooling me. I don't want to get no extra. And I don't want you to know excess carbs sneaking into my mouth. You know what I'm saying? Very good. But just a little bit of that on your sauce each. We have an open line in a green line like two of them. What is that? Is there somebody really on here? I can't believe it. Hello. Yeah. How are we going to fish? Yeah. Okay. How are you? Okay. Take a good fish and stick away the Mundo and China. Okay. Like you're on. Let's see you do a run Jeremy. Here's sunrise on a purple line. Hello. Hey. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. All right. How are you doing? Good. You're doing the best. You're doing the best. No. I think the Sony is the best for more people. Tell me. Even the wife. Of course. The RCA because I got it first before the Sony came up, but they said the Sony has got like more capability of doing more things. It's set of run so on and in long run it's going to be better. And I think it's about the same price. Oh, really. Just want all the question on. Yeah. Can you get the local channels with that or you need a separate antenna? Why do you need a separate antenna? Or if you want to get the networks you can lie about where you live and tell them that you can't get cable reception and the local channels. You can pick up the network affiliates like WABC in New York and WRAL for CBS, Netherlands, Rolley and WXIA for NBC and Atlanta, etc. So it's up to you whether you're desperate to see your success. Great show Neil. Okay. Thanks a lot. Open line on that purple AT&T. Uh, cellular. AT what is an AT&T wireless? Whatever we call it. Okay. Whatever we call it at pound IOD and 200 green lines in West Palm Beach and Boca. I would have thought that are that thing from Reuters, but why would I think? You know, nothing no matter what it is you come in here. I've said this for years. You think that whatever it is that really got you. Like the thing on CBS News last night. I mean, what kind of a story is that? What kind of a horrendous, grotesque? I mean, a raciel's cousin gets murdered by the cops in Pittsburgh. He's a black eye in a Jaguar in a white neighborhood. Fifty minutes later he's dead. No drugs. Very little booze like maybe one drink in his blood and that's it. And he's dead. Nobody cared about that. Nobody gave a flying crap about the comments of Louis Ferrican's good buddy and top and the best part of it is he's the National Youth Minister. He's the head of the Nazi Bund for the Ferrican people. Canal X. National Youth Minister for the Nation of Islam. And by the way, another thing that I'm seeing. And this is spreading all over the country by the way in public schools. We've had some talk about it here. I'm not sure if there are any schools here doing it. Where they put the kids in these uniforms, you know, with a white shirt and the pants and the tie and they all look the same. So they don't have to fight about who's got the best designer clothing and who's got the more money. I am going to tell you man, I can see the Nazi Youth out there marching with their fists and their arms up in the air. It is the most scary guy damn thing. Let's take away everybody's individuality. Let's all dress them up the same. Rain, wash them and Deutschland, Uber, Rollis. Baby, it's disgusting. And a lot of parents think, oh, that's a great idea. Now I don't have to worry about going to guy damn J.C. pennies. They're came out and buy some more clothing for the fall. They got their little outfit. They're uniform. They're all the same. Like we cut them all out of the same guy damn cookie cutter. All right. Here's for a lot of day. Hello. Hello, New York. Yes, sir. Yeah. First time calling a long time listener. Okay. I want to call your attention to something I saw in this wonderful newspapers that Melissa Rugery works for. Yeah, the sun, the slum Sentinel. That's the one. Did you yesterday's paper Wednesday October 18? Yeah. They've got the same article on two different pages in the same section here. The local section. You got an article deadline. How and they'll want to foil your contractor. Oh, and on the very next page. Yeah. They got the same identical article under a slightly different headline. How and they'll move to dump contract. Well, it's a big news you've had to understand. In addition to which their readers in how and they all brain dead anyway, they probably missed it the first 20 or 30 times. I'm going to put it on every page. I thought this was just emblematic of the wonderful, uh, and let's see. We got two bush league newspapers in this town. We don't have anything that even resembles a real newspaper. And it's perfect. It's a perfect fit. You know, you go to fill the you get to the inquire. I mean, with an eye or real paper. You go to Boston. You get to globe or the Harold, which are two real newspapers. You're to Chicago. You get the well, the tribute and the sun times which come close. But I mean, here. You don't have a newspaper that even comes close to be in a real newspaper. Right. I can read my son's sent a little morning. Between the time I pick it up outside and take the guy named soggy a plastic oven. I can walk back to the toilet sit down for two minutes and that's it. It's it's a real bush league. Yep. I just like to say to Melissa Rujeri that Neil is the deity. And have a good. And up a rest. Okay. I'll have a great life. Yeah, but you know, they're just waiting. And of course, if we do have a good book in Boston, back, which probably will happen someday. Well, I see talk radio is coming back. Somebody lifted that dark cloud over W.O.D. Are you fooling somebody, Melissa? Are you trying to fool somebody like they can't. Are they that stupid that they can't see through this transparent pain. A glass you got over your ass where you hate all of us over here like poison. Never even mentioned Rick and Sud's of course, like they don't even exist. And then she throws in at great line. Did you read that sarcastic line? She's got in there. Talk amongst yourselves. The Simpson trial could have been should have won W.O. and Z blockbuster ratings by Bababa. Dr. Joinaud at the more irreverent W.O.D. 610 AM. There seems to be a black cloud hanging. A black cloud. Not a white cloud. You racist bitch. For the second book in a row, the station's 25 to 54 age group ratings have slipped in every time slot except for a slightly passion phone show hosted by Aaron Summers. While Summers aged from a 26 to a 33. Woo! Three, three. Heavy duty sweetheart at night. That number means she's got like 10 or any guys listening and are sitting around having a circle jerk. While she heads from a 26 to a 33. Midday man Neil Rogers wasn't as fortunate. Perhaps the most popular personality not named Howard airing in South Florida. Did you hear that? Perhaps the most popular personality not named Howard in South Florida. I got news for him. Well, let's say you got your head so far off Howard's ass. You're going to wake up on day with the same nose in the same haircut. Okay, bitch. Rogers lost a significant portion of his audience in the 25 54 demographic. Sleeping from a 570-46 afternoon host Phil Henry didn't fair much better in the same demographic sliding from a 4.0 to a 3.0. Oh yeah, and and and let's see your paycheck, Melissa. Let's see what you got. It's been strange. Just wait. 16 WIOD by Emmy Fortlottardaire. How news talk and entertainment radio. 16 WIOD. The water to two hours. The water to two hours.

The other day, our, uh, actually earlier, that the rest of the world didn't really care about this old J thing. I was sitting over in Australia, Melbourne. Yeah. On the day that the verdict was read and it was front page headline. Oh, yeah. Day that the verdict was read. But all those months when it was going on. I can't speak for Australia. But I know I was in Rome, a few times during that period of time. And then Berlin and Amsterdam. And, you know, you'd have to dig into the newspapers way back, even the international Harold Tribune and find a little tiny article. And even though it was on CNN International, and people could watch it, I don't think most people gave a crap. But then, of course, when the verdict came out, it was like a big hype job. Everybody wanted all what it was. Yeah. That was pretty amazing. Yeah. I've never been so embarrassed in my life. We were sitting in a little cafe and they had a TV going. And it was on that on a local news channel. And all the people jumping up and down, waving their hands. And, you know, the sterile. Really? And he's not, not in the shop on TV. Oh, I see you.

They don't care about Channel X. They don't care about the Channel number five. They don't know from nothing up there. That's why they moved to Palm Beach because they want to be isolated and oblivious. And we respect that. So mind your own business and get out of here. At night, there's passion on 16WIODs. And my first wife, there'd be no breakfast and no cookie. That was, it was strictly not possible. The second wife, you could have a cookie or you'd have breakfast beating, get both. Okay.

Isn't he? And his gorgeous. Tony. I wonder if I didn't enter in a word that they were like singing, but I enjoyed it never the last. That's okay. You don't have to understand the words. It was great. Yeah. And if one did you think you also would ask you a question about the I can style it? Yeah. I was thinking of starting and I have maybe 10 pounds to lose. Right.

We've had the time to call you actually. And hang on for hours and patch you around, right? No problem. But nobody ever mentioned this one thing about. What happened recently in Miami. Do you know about the the sewer pipes at first? Down by was this game Bay is on my back. The sewer pipes that burst by biscane bay. No, a crap went in the water. And all the. When in the water? That's right. Yeah. It images me because I moved down here in 1990. Bottom's up. And I read about that in the paper. And they were saying, well, it's going to happen. It's going to happen. And why didn't nobody do anything? Like what? Like, oh, drink, couple of glasses of water. Make sure was okay. No, I'm like, try to fix the problem before it actually burst. And all the crap went in. Oh, no, listen. If we don't have something like that happen. And guys like you wouldn't have anything. You upset about. We don't want to live in a perfect world. The Lord didn't plan it that way. He likes a lot of screwups. Would out of nice beaches. We don't have much of a tourist track. That's for damn sure. That's why we don't have no tourist here. If you notice, look around you. Man, there ain't nobody here. I just a bunch of illegal. I'm Tonya. So we got his de rubber raft business. Just a couple of pace of wise. That's it. Anyway, it's about all that. Do you ever feel that life is passing us by? Yep. Yep. When you're in South Florida, you get that feeling every day when you wake up. Sometimes you feel. It's back and out, right? There you go. Okay. When it's out clean it out, pal. I have a good one. And back to you. Sometimes I feel the norm saying that, uh, Where the hell is it? I'm tired. Oh, no. I don't want that. That one blows. Yeah. That apple. Let's play the original one. I get that guy excited. I called the other day that was chewing me out. So I didn't play the stock yet. Okay. Sometimes I feel. I'll get around with that life. He's passing me by. Sometimes I feel that people don't want to smile. You sound of his bitch. But when I listen to your show. You make me smile like a child. And you can help me get by my friend. Be cold at all my radio. Be cold at all my radio. On my radio. On my radio. He's in heaven now. And then when they said in France, hmm. I heard that scene when she was carrying on and back off to the mother. He's in heaven now. Oh, my God. And by the way, the people from QA, I'm the two assholes that own at station and release the piece of it. But you're standing there on the whole thing. I guess they went up to River, uh, Tuesday night before the hockey game. When it was about to do the play by play. Pretending to want to say hi and shake his hand. And made a bunch of cost to owners. Nearroges. Good friend. You guys got something going on. You know, you two guys seriously. If rains were dangerous, you'd be the safest pair on a face of the earth. You're trapped that you got on a year man. I wouldn't wish on Ferrican and Hitler put together. So congratulations, at least you're consistent. And by the way, up your ass, that's from Bill Colter. 122 at WIOD. George. 10 WIOD. Months linking with the best of the only $50. Okay, 125 at WIOD. Don't forget the Ben and Bob's is open in Western. That's a branch of Lorenzo's, which we've been telling you about Lorenzo's for a month now. And Lorenzo's has been there for like over 40 years with the great wines and meats and deli department.

If you don't want, because they've got Ben and Bob's a market in the same traditional of Lorenzo's. Open right now in the Indian Trace shopping center in Western. Unbelievable. And not only will they have all the great stakes in the seafood and the produce and the big goods, but they'll also have all the Dr. Rattkins diet foods available, plus catering services and gourmet and go food baskets as well. So the tradition and commitment to freshness and service of Lorenzo's Italian Center comes to Broward right now, as I speak, at Ben and Bob's fresh produce and seafood markets in the Indian Trace shopping center. That's a 1368 Southwest, 160th Ave in Western, called 389, 6169 are stop-by-and-seam. Today, good news for everybody in Broward, especially if you be on the Atkins. Okay, it's 1.26 a WIOD. Let's do Miami. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm a little bit sick of Lewis Farcán and Nation of Islam and the Virgin in general. I'm really fed up. Yeah. And I'll tell you why. He's a real good example of religion's all about. He gets up there talking about Alain, Elijah Muhammad and God this and Solomon that. And only does this view hate just like most religions. You know, it's like the Greeks. They made up their own gods. You know, they all happen to have the characters they wanted. Right. And all their gods kept jotted as soap, those Greeks. Yeah. I grew up as a pinocostal, preachers kid. Not my fault, but anyway. I've decided very recently to become an agnostic. Uh-huh. And let's let it all go and let it all go. Hang on. Yeah. And the best thing that has happened to me is just getting with a religion. I'm reading philosophy. I want to see life of Brian. I even rented last temptation of crayon. How are you talking? Excellent movie. I recommend it to anybody who wants to look. Once it's something creative and that actually might make you even think. There you go. All frightening concepts. Yeah, but this fairy content and then. Oh, God. I mean, I grew up with religion. I grew up with swaggered and Paul and Jane. Oh, God. It was awful. And Jimmy Baker. Now I look back on it. I think man must have been possessed. Yeah. Well, congratulations on emancipating your brain, my friend. Can I request something? Yes, sir. In honor of my coming out of religion. Yeah. Can you place something maybe like the Pope bit that. Why are you playing that? How about the word made them all? I like. What's the word made them all? That's my favorite. All right. So good. Okay. Thanks. Bless you. Open line and date you, Ethan. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Son of a bitch. Why don't you not forget the God, the Lord. A God, whatever he is, he made Luis Miguel, not Luis Ferrican. Okay. Just keep that in mind, pal. So anyway, moving right along is we continue on our heathen way. Let's do a mobile and North Miami Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Hi. Hi. I'm calling. I'm about to act in the second question. Oh, good. For a couple of days. All right. I'll just make up an answer. Okay. Well, friend of mine. I read in there that you couldn't drink diet so does much as you want. But no caffeine. She got to caffeine free. Caffeine free. Caffeine trust me. Get rid of that caffeine. It's bad. I'll screw up your metabolism. It'll stop you in your tracks. I haven't read that far in the book yet. You have to read a little bit more reading. There you go. Okay. Okay, pal. But see everybody's on the atkins. The young, the old, the dead, the living, the near dead. In between everybody's on it now. It's one of the greatest things. And of course, channel tended that stupid stupid piece on it here a few weeks ago. Totally doing injustice with that stupid bitch that registered dietitian who wouldn't know a diet if they slipped it up or asked. And she's also, by the way, didn't give me any credit for doing anything about it. Only my friends at the harrel that nice lady. What was your name? They wrote that really great article in the Harrel that day. I have it at home. You're watching us. Uh huh. Liz. Liz. I love you. Liz. You're about the only good thing at the harrel sweetheart. You're about to get a codey once in a while and Michael will hold a mail. But other than that, they can take their herald and they can wipe her ass with the two. Not Liz, I'm sorry. Here is a four-larit of hello. You know? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I want to talk about fairer. How come you're whispering? I want to talk about fairer. Yes, sir. I want it to talk about fairer. I heard you, yeah. Okay. You know. I want to talk about fairer, can I? Yeah. Okay. You know. You got to understand what? What? What? The black race has been through, man. Yeah. How about what the Jews have been through? Well, you understand that too. Yeah. So how come he can be anti-Semitic? What's the point? We're saying what I'm saying? I don't want to agree with some of the things that he said. Yeah. So you can't like pick and choose. Like people who believe in the Bible, they picked this stuff that sounds good and they discard all of nonsense. Yeah. We'll see. I read the Bible. Now, bet. And I go by everything that's in the Bible. There you go. You know, don't be putting up with this obedient kid you better stone them to that. Yeah. You know. Yeah. Okay. Well, get busy. We have an open line of Broward 524 Boy. It's really sad. Isn't that it's dangerous? What little bit of education can do or vice versa? Open line of Broward 524Wild, D1 on a green line, 1-800-944-494. See, it's one thing to be angry. It's one thing to be desperate. I do understand that. But this crap about the Jews man. Because I do have a jaunist view on it because I'm Jewish and I'm real happy to be Jewish. I don't believe any of the religious bullcraft part of it. But there's something about Jewish like the Yiddish and just fun and a food and all that stuff. It's just fun to be Jewish. Plus there's a certain ethic, work ethic and education. There's a certain thing about Judaism that's a positive thing if they would just discard all the Bible mice. You know what I'm saying? And don't forget Brisket. And Bris. Bris and Brisket. Now you're catching on. All right. But you were talking about the good points. Yeah, you can at least see the point. Okay. We're not too big on turtles. You're not too big. On turtles. That's right. Two big or on turtles. And from whenever you ain't too big either. So just the dummy. Just put your head back in your shell. What was I about to say? Something about the damn Jews. All about the fact that we at least, but this ferrican and all this breeding of anti-Semitism and the gutter religion. And this asshole saying, Black youth and outbound relationship with the Jewish community about Bapah and the Jews better be prepared for war. I mean, you know, enough already with this crap. Looking for escape code. And like I said, that's exactly what Hitler did. And that's what ferrican does. And there is absolutely no different except skin color and a mustache. Okay. So don't give me the song to dance about. Well, I don't agree with somebody says, but there's some of it that makes some sense. Yeah. Like don't do drugs and don't take care of your babies and stop being deadbeat. Okay. We can buy that. But you don't have to listen to a Nazi to figure that out for yourself. If you can't figure that much out, then just lay down and take a long nap. There it. Here's the lady in Pembroke pine. Hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. I was wondering if you still watched Jennifer Vropi in the news. God forbid, I don't watch that channel under penalty of death. Oh, God. You should have watched it about two nights ago. She made a rumor about your ass. Yes. We're going to make an ass of ourselves. I had a spy report on that. Oh, it was a funny thing. Yeah, they were just for those who were asked from what I hear. Oh, it was so funny. Yeah. I thought about you immediately. She said smart answering a smart answering mark. And Tony, of course, went into with Charlotte, a turtle and just panicked and said, I was so funny, Neil. Beautiful. I also went to the ass. You know, it's Barbara Sloan saying smart ass on channel 4. I guarantee you that. And that's true. All right. Also, when they asked you, how's your thanks for calling lady? How is she? Yeah. I haven't heard from her for a while. I think she's okay. There was a rumor that she called Phelia yesterday, but I'm sure she wouldn't get sucked into that. She didn't call me. She didn't. Well, she called you lately. Yeah, a few days ago. Oh, good. How too long? Oh, good. We just don't like to overdo it. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Well, that's good. That's smart. Well, you have a great day. Okay. See you. Broward, open. I don't mean like a line open. I mean all of Broward, everything from God damn, a hell and Dale all the way up to Pablo Beach and Dearfield and right up to the God damn Palm Beach line. 5249463, 524WI. 10. As Luke's environment's all the field, when they took steps to deal with it. 16WIOD news was there. I'm here because I'm the Christian father. I'm a Christian husband. I'm a Christian son. In the head, you know, I experienced domestic violence on a first hand basis. The best news. News talking entertainment radio. 16WIOD. I thought the cup cooking. I don't talk much. I don't need to anymore. Talk it so cheap. I'm the lead. What a bull. I don't speak anymore. With my motor. I communicate using speeches. Really. I can rate and a bull. I can rate and a bull. I'm that you online in a chat room. Your comments were waiting your email was through. Every steps many want to go to bed. Is it odd that I've never heard of where the truth is said? That's how we go. My voice is gone. I'm only speaking to you. It's okay. You're just not gone. And get turned on by my eye. You son of a... Oh. It's nice and safe to sit and pass. When you do it on the internet. It's a man. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you. It's not you. It's because we're all not alone. Score. Score. This connect baby. Bad news. 141 at WI. It's kind of like running out of quarters. Open line and Broward. 5249463. 524WIOD. And of course if you run out of quarters in your reach, we'll deepen your pocket. Oh, damn it. Here's Miami Beach. Hello. Actually, Neil, it's the shores. But thank you. Miami shores. Yes. Well, how do you like that? Neil, I...no suck it up here. You're the best man. You're the best on the radio. Well, me and Phil were the best. We're joining a forces now. I don't know. One day I'll be the best and I'll be the best. I did give him that idea yesterday. So I'll take a little credit. I don't hear much of him. But why not? I don't just don't have the time. Well, late the time. If you were to hurt two to three yesterday, you'd be sick in a different two of them. And he was phenomenal. But I wanted a first ball agree with you on the Lewis Fattercans, March on Washington. Yeah. It's the shame to see them make such a big fool out of themselves. It's a real shame. And it's a shame to be some people to watch some people in the media trying somehow desperately to legitimize this son of a bitch. He is the most virulent, the most obnoxious, the most dangerous character on a face of the earth right now. And there are people try to give him legitimacy and say, well, you're taking things out of context. Right. Like all you Jews can go straight to hell. And you don't understand that this guy, everything he stands for when he gets up there and talks. No matter what he says, he's a fraud. Yeah. Then they just don't have to get it. And I'll get it. The other thing was, I was listening to Hank Goldberg. Well, no one is on the press. And Hank was asked about the practice squad. Somebody called him up and asked about the practice squad. Hey, stupid. Yeah. He first said it wrong on the air and then he couldn't admit that he was wrong. And somebody from the NFL called to clarify. And he still wasn't right. Yeah. And he kept insisting that he was right the entire time and he was completely wrong. His guys were supposed to be an NFL expert. Well, column up and ask him a who the goalie for the capitals is, let's see what it comes up with. Maybe maybe you figured out who Jim Kiri was with the mask. Have a great day, pal. Have a material. See you. Yeah. In fact, somebody told me that that show he does on the doosh that he was on a couple of nights ago. I think Defoe was tell me and also Rimmer that Hank was on there with his little hammer with his ball peony hammer. And he was interviewing Kelly Rudy, the goal tender with the L.A. King's and I, and I'm thinking of myself having Hank interview a Kelly Rudy would be like have an Andy Calb interview Westbrook fan Voorhees about journalism. You know what I'm saying? It's just, I just don't get it. I'm sorry, but I'm missing something somewhere. WOT. Oh, sorry. We missed you. George is putting cards away, which is probably just as well. I'm not sure if he's going to let a ring that many times who needs you anyway. Here is a curlgable. Wow. And he always prepared to go in another direction. Well, you're all over the play. We got you splattered all over now. I heard a little of that going to the hockey game. I heard some hockey talk and we didn't. He was getting there. She moves and that was he actually said that nobody's been closer to Jimmy Johnson in the last four years. Then he chose a geeky. Oh, really? I don't know how close he meant. All right. That's right. Jim is here as grommie. We rubbed off from Joe Zibwell. He said JJ wasn't interested in the dolphin coaching job. And that he knows because him, Joseph Eaky, has been close. Here's a gaggy socks. Okay. I'm going to take it right now. I know a guy who does work. I can't say what kind of work. In Jimmy Johnson's homes both in Dallas and down here. And you can tell Joe's a gaggy. He's full of crap. I know. I know for a fact. I know for a fact that Jimmy Johnson is salivating. Wait for sure. Let the fall on his ass. Absolutely. Anyway, that's why he's. That's why he's how did the dolphin so big at the start of the season. And has been touting him all along. Because he's setting him up for the big fall. Absolutely. Anybody who thinks otherwise is an idiot. I don't know the thing he said. He said that he knows he's got the inside line that's. I'm coming ten will be starting for UM this year. About two hours later, which Davis announces that Ryan Claimman's going to talk. All right. All right. Joe's a gaggy drop dead. Elvala by Bineel. Okay. Yeah, he's just like Denise Pothman who by the way, Denise Pothman was out in Denver last night at the Avalanche Capital's game. And he was on for like about two minutes on a pre game show. So even when the Panthers have a few days off, he can't get away from Denise. He's everywhere. He's extending his testicle at tentacles all over the hockey world. What's he doing out there auditioning for another job? How about your rimmer only praise? Here's Jensen V. Hello. Hello. Yes. Hey, man. I'm up here in Martin County home with a piece. Yeah. How's that thing doing? You ain't that down yet or what? I'll probably put it back in the hole. They stuck it back in the hole. Oh, hey. I know those bastards could do it. And the pole team. They need a diagram, but if you show more to stick it, they can do it. Absolutely. I went to a comedy club this weekend. Yeah. And guess who the M.C. was. Chris Baker. Nope. Steve Patterson. Oh, my God. And you know about sticking it back in the hole. Right. He said something about Canadians. So somebody yelled out the frogs. Yeah. And he's like, go a couple of IOD listeners. He said I used to work there, but I didn't get along with the talent so I had to quit. Yeah. They get that kind of out of holes. He told my side of the hole. There you go. Yeah. They blew his side of there. Beautiful. Hey, let me ask you something. He didn't get along with the talent. And I'd not get along. He just stuck on the air. That's all. Yeah. Just sucked. Hey. How do you check your blood sugar? You got to go with doctor for that. No, seriously. Why are you diabetic? No. I just want to check it. Why? Because I'm working out and I'm changing my diet. Oh, my God. Then you're the kind of guy should get a blood test and have them check your blood sugar. But like an ordinary diabetic type person like ordinary animal. What that means. But they have a thing you can get in the drugs. Do it's about 70, 80 bucks called a glucometer. Right. And you have to like stick your finger a little bit if you're not squeamish and get just a little drop of blood on the test strip and stick it into the thing. And then about a minute it shows you your blood tray. Very important if you got like either either diabetic or a low blood sugar. Yeah, I think my might be low. Why do you better check it out when it's out? So you just stick it, huh? Just stick it. Or just stick it in the hole if you like. Hey, one more thing. Yeah. George. The there and summer's really have a great ass. I'm waiting George. It'll do. He said it'll do. That's it. Yeah. Another one little bit. Like, you know, he never seen a close and person like the PD did call up Steve Neckle and he'll tell you. Have a great day, pal. Later. See ya. I'll never forget that she's only got about a three share on air. She ain't doing that great and she's often Tampa and probably on the verge here too. We can't sell the show, but she's got a great ass. I like it. I like it. As what he said. I said it takes one to like one and he said, well, what does that mean? Draw me a diaphragm. So she's in the family way too, by the way, the sex bitch. That's all right. I'm plugging that show. I want you all to listen to the sex bitch for me tonight because I don't want her going off here. I don't want to give the appearance, you know, we go, oh, it's bad. We craft out in Tampa. We took her off the run as you went because of the AFA even though they deny it. They wanted the hockey games on. Okay. And then it took Howard off in Chicago just as it turned out he was kicking everybody's ass. And our cox station Mike Disney, no less back to the end of a quarter. I'm not here. Here's a bunch of money. Just go away. So how embarrassing would it be for us to double you. I would need to blow off the sex bitch right at a time when we're, you know, doing a Bendonite everybody else. My God. I mean, you talk about a company that doesn't have even a slight an essence of a guy owned. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. 148, a WOT in Kion. Kion. Kion. Kion. There's Jackie again on the Kion. Kion on sweetheart. WIOD. Jerry Garcia's favorite station. Hey, go, Max. Still sucks. Uuuh.

It's nothing like the book. Cause, if it was, nobody would go see it. Who's son of a bitch? 153 at Wiod.D. Here's a mobile in Carroll City. Hello. Hi Neil. Yes sir. Second call in today. Sorry about that. Hey. You know what I feel about the gacky. As in. Okay. I thought you had it ready. Yeah. Anyway. As far as Hank goes, he was on the doosures about three nights ago. Tony Dorset. This is after he went on five this weekend. By the way. Yeah. He's a manry at any right. He had Dorset there. And he says, Tony, why do you expect to be inducted into the Dallas Cowboy ring of fame? And Dorset looks at him trying to dump founded. And he says, I am Hank. Yeah. Right there on the doosures. How you doing? I'm closing. Hey, I'm blankin. When are you going to be making that speech again? Right. In closing. I heard O.J. and Jason did it. I heard Jason said, go get the car. O.J. said, ax mom. Okay. See ya. He was doing so well to totally start to get in that old material. You know, stay. But I guess he knows who's a gackie is. You know, I'm going to tell you one thing. You know, it's how I shame the gackie and get those glasses off on TV. Like in one or two days. Boy, you talk about having influence and power. Okay. Now get rid of the eyebrows, Joe, and get yourself a personality you'll have it made. And learn something. Here's Medley. Hello. Yeah. Yes, sir. Yeah. Hello. How are you doing? I like to speak to Neil. Speaking. This is me. How are you doing? First time call her. All right. And I like to touch on two things. Here. The first thing will be, uh, I think rotation hook up with Lorraine. I think they've written good couple. There you go. I like it. One good slice deserves another. Right. Okay. Well, one of the thing is, um, I think you're a little hard on the blacks. I mean, I think we came along when this country and, uh, I don't think the kind of messed up right now. But I, I, I, I think if, um, Yeah, but wait a minute. I'm so hard on the blacks. I'll come on the only person talking about the thing about Racial's cousin. That got murdered by the cops in Pittsburgh was on CBS evening news last night. For some reason, whatever it is, it's not in any of the newspapers, except a little column yesterday. This is a major story. It's part of the crap that's been going on for forever and ever and Scott has stopped. That's one of the biggest gripes you got as police brutality in all these young blacks who are in jail, most of whom probably are many of whom shouldn't be there. Yeah. Well, that's true. That's true. I'm trying to be here. I'm just, I'm just very agitated. I know there are a lot of desperate black people out there. But don't look to demagogues to solve the problems. Don't look to Louis Veracanza to roll because they're out the answer. No, well, I don't believe, see, the majority of blacks, I don't believe that. Look to Louis Farcone to find a way out. But, like I said, Louis Farcone is not the guard of the black people. I hope not. No, he's not. And I think, and one little off the subject, I believe that a black person will quicker accept the white person than a white person can accept a black person. No, I don't believe that. You know, I don't, I think there's plenty of racism on both sides. And there's plenty of decent, broad-minded people on both sides. I think there's plenty of hate in this country to go around. I don't think they have to try to give them what they want to do. It's a contest to see who hates the most. I'm embarrassed that a United States man, the hate, the racism here. It's outrageous. It's making us look bad everywhere. I mean, everybody's laughing at us. That's right. We got to get our crap together, man. That's right. We need to million people, march, not black or white people, just all people. Everyone, that's agree with that. There you go. Well, I don't think your racism is sometimes from your conversation with me one day. You know, I'm white. So I see things from a white person's perspective, but I deal with people as individuals. And when people tell me I'm a racist, maybe I am to a little degree like everybody's a racist. Some minor degree, but in terms of being a bigot, I am not in any basis that can jam it up their ass. Okay. Have a great day, pal. All right. Thanks, man. See you. Speaking of racist by the way, here's that entire story from Dallas, I'm just, see this is what this guy ought to be upset about. And I'm sure he is and everybody else. A white Dallas school teacher is off the job because of complaints he told black students. They should go back to Africa. What kind of a teacher is that? What they said, harassed back where she came from. Officials at unfreely elementary school say 51 year old Dean Williamson was suspended yesterday with pay pending an investigation. Some shock parents say their fifth graders told them Williamson told pupils Monday's Midian man, March of Black men in Washington was worthless. They say that when youngsters disagreed, she told them to return to Africa. And attorney for Williamson did not immediately be turned calls for comment. I can't imagine why. How do you like that? That's f***ing bitch. I mean, here's somebody that's a school teacher. Like I was telling you the other day, a lot of these school teachers are total misfits have never even got through guide day in school. For this thing, they'll work with a crappy, you know what's yours? And she's in the classroom telling the black kids to go back to Africa because she didn't like the march. I didn't like the march either. I thought it was a waste of time. But I'm not telling anybody to go where they came from except that bitch. Why don't you go back to Canada to get your bachelor's? Here's a lady in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Oh, hi Neil. Yes, man. I've been listening to you since WINC when you started off with the birds. Right. And I'm getting old. I have years of gone behind me. Hey, yeah, me too. How do I still do this? I don't know. But when you go on vacation, radio is the best way to end. It's yeah. Yeah. It's obvious in the ratings too, these summer books when I have two weeks that I'm gone and the Rick Wissick for two weeks. It's deadly if they could just find some living person to be on other than default, by the way. They can find a living person to fill in who I could do a little talk. And I think we, you know, hold our own. I agree with you totally. Right. They got to work on it. It's a little talent. That should be their number one priority so that like in morning drive, when those guys go on vacation to put tapes on and morning drive, it's unconscionable. I find a body out there, find somebody. They don't seem to listen to you. Yeah. Well, that's for sure. Yeah. Like I said, I love the tapes. Yeah. I wanted to ask you one thing because I've been listening to starting Monday on the Asked him to hire. Yeah. And I can't figure this out. But night try. It says no night try. But everything you look at is. Well, it's just because you don't want to, you know, when that's all you're putting in your body, he doesn't want you to take a lot of chemicals in there. But if the night trites are like the last ingredient or close to the last ingredient on a label, I wouldn't worry about it. Like most of your meats in it, although Lorenzo does have the stuff with no night try. I know, but I don't try. So I can't get down there. Yeah. So just just look for the status. I look at the bacon. You like I like bacon. Yeah. And the best of last ingredient in it. Yeah. If it's the last ingredient, don't worry about it. Oh, thank you so much, Neil. Good luck. Bye. See ya. So anyway. Who's son of a bitch? Hey, Newt. We got your contract right here. My name is John W. I. I'm a Ford Latterdale. I'm a new stock in entertainment radio. 610 W I O D.
