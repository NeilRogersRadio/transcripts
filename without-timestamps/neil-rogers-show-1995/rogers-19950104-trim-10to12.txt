When you have that extra day holiday, you just lost. Happy Thursday. Let's get out of here for the weekend. So I did see that thing on channel 4 news last night and it proved to be on a shadow over-doubt. What a silly goose that the segretto is. Did you see the part where he looked Ron Bennington right in the face? And he asked him that stupid question. Have you guys ever seen me chose Dina Sue? I mean, I thought to me that was the probably the lowest piece of trash I've ever seen in the history of urinalism. And how about that nude gingrich and his mother on CBS this morning? Oh, yes. She's a bitch. Oh, sorry. Did anybody see that? That was a beautiful thing. I thought he was going to get up and smack Paul Azana a couple of times. Beater up around the shoulders and the armpits and just to haul ass. It was a beautiful thing. By the way, speaking of freebies, I do have something about once a month. We have a periodic thing. If I can use that expression, Shindler's list. Look at this double offset, double video cassette, Shindler's list. So if we have any like old Jew that wants this, it'd be more than happy to give it to you. Still is plastic container. Shindler's list as in boy. So anyway, the big news which we had it on here here first like weeks ago. How many weeks ago do we have that on here? About Casternova going over to Zeta? About two weeks ago? Yeah, at least something like that. Maybe a 10 days ago that Casternova was going over there that Ron and Ron would be dead meat. And Rick Riley, of course, has all been out of shape because he feels that we've been treated unfairly or that he's been treated unfairly. And he ought to get used to it because that's the way this town is. The local media in this town sucks. There are a bunch of morons. You have a bunch of stringers who write for the newspapers. And if you think that they're going to ever give you a fair shake, all they know is how or this and how or that and Larry King this and Lard asks Limbaugh that and Michael Jackson this and Madonna that. And that's this about 10 and Rosanne. We can't leave her out. The hype people Arnold and Slice Deloam with this $20 million movie that has been written yet. That's what the life is all about man. That's what it's all about is hype. We're not the hype. Like I told Rick, we're not the masters of hype or the masters of being comatocinist place. Oh, we got a great station. But let's not tell anybody about it. Don't say it too loud. Somebody might find out. Listen and enjoy it. Okay. But anyway, I told you about to run and run thinking about Casper Nova. Are they up to the teas yet on Zeta? They're doing their A through Z. Like I told you yesterday. And then they're going to go to their progressive. They're all alternative. Whatever it's going to be. They're going to be right up there again. She either going to be doing AOR. And now we're going to have two AOR stations to split the 2.8 share that she's been doing. So they can vote through about a one something which will be right in line with buddy Bud Paxon's territory. Here was the only claim to fame. Here's a guy that's got a $12 million house owns 75,000 radio stations in a bunch of other crap and did it all through that slot home shopping network, which is where he made all of his money and also buying and selling a lot of distress radio stations for a fun and profit. Who knows nothing about this business? Who wouldn't know a good show if it bit him on the ass. And the only claim to fame he ever had in any of his stations was the Ron and Ron show whether I liked it or not that was another story I've already spoken my piece on it. But that was his only claim to fame. So now he's got casted all over there playing the more music more often on radio or rock revely whatever that means starting tomorrow morning. And going to do about a one five or two share in the morning. They're back to obscurity like Zeta has been since somebody I know left there in the morning seven years ago. They're going to go right back in a crap or. And buddy Bud is going to be at least be consistent. That's what I've always said life if you can't be good at least be consistent. That's what they are consistently invisible in a ratings. They have no audience whether it's I and Z. By the way, did we ever tell that Elaine at tourist during in detail? Do we know any more about that? The fact that she got blown out over there is news directorist and the reason that nobody is talking about is because she is suing them in a sex discrimination suit. She started suing before they blew her out. Oh, I see. Well, I can't imagine why they blew her out then. She was suing and then they fired her. That's a surprise. A smart movie, Lane honey. Nice move, baby. And get that nose a refixed. She had a nose for news that Elaine at tour. So she gooseed them up to about a water about a one share. So this market continues to amaze in the ston so there's an article in a Harold and one in the Sun sent over which I'll get into. Also I have got tons of crap today, man. Oh, what are these people want? They want that chindler's list? Look at that. I sat down here like bake an empty board basically. Nobody gives a crap about anything because they're still looking at their ones about the U of M and boy, I got plenty to say about that too about the University of Miami and that outlaw football program. In fact, this whole thing that goes on in sports today, this step in fetching mentality, which is totally unacceptable, totally unacceptable. And most people they'll talk about it in private, but you're not supposed to talk about it in public. I think the NAACP ought to sue every one of these universities, especially the University of Miami, for allowing this kind of behavior to be seen in public. Going out there and acting like something I was stepping fetched from like 50 years ago, putting on this damn I'm telling you, if you talk about promoting stereotypes and prejudice, that's exactly what these guys are doing with their stupid clown act. And people are really, you know, people are laughing at them. They're not laughing with them. They're laughing at them. So black people in this country want to continue to be kept in the dark ages. If you've brought another expression, here's the perfect way to do it. It's keep fulfilling the stereotype man. Just keep going out and having these guys go on there and do their step in fetching routine and meanwhile, everybody has laughing at them. Trust me when I tag guaranteed. Everybody has said this is the same thing. They don't want to say it on here because well, just we don't talk about these things in polite conversation. Well, what's polite about it? It's rude. It's crude. It's obnoxious and it's unacceptable behavior. And screw these guys. So anyway, we got the press release from Ron and Ron here. Also, did not see the thing on channel for news last night where Tony Segretto asked them. Have you guys ever seen me tell us do you need a food? But I hear about George saw it. You saw it yourself. And, you know, of course, there's several sides to the story and generally speaking, there's a lot of liars all away around. Like on a one hand, you know, Mersky saying one thing and then on the other hand, they're claiming that it was the announcement of the DS's wife having AIDS, which is why the show got yanked off in Miami and Jacksonville, which is not the truth because they already knew about that months and months and months and months ago. And now they're trying to say, oh, gee, just a couple of days after the announcement, the show gets yanked off the year. And that's why they're taking us off the year, which has nothing to do with that. So, you know, that kind of reinforces the things that we're hearing 10 days ago about the fact that they were using this announcement to try to build up sympathy and to try to get the packs and the renew their contract. You know, I mean, you talk about crass. Okay. I know there are a lot of guys who like their show, young, you know, 18 to 34 meals, especially. They had an audience, although it was diminishing rapidly and Howard was blowing them off the map quickly. And they were already on the way down. Rick would be very upset if I didn't mention that. Rick and the suds were taking plenty of their audience. They were already on the way down and out. But to use something like that, the guy's wife's illness, she's got AIDS. And to use that to try to explore the situation, which is that a lot of people perceive it to be is about as crass and low as you can go. I mean, that's just unconscionable. But there are a lot of people who believe that that's what they did. It didn't work. 10 17 to WIOD. So we got just a pilot crap to go on here. Who wants that to stay moving by the way? And those old Jews on the fall? Unless they're an old Jew, they're not going to get it. At least over the age of 200. I want Shinelist list. What's the old giving away? And of course, if they're old Jews, they probably don't have a VCR anyway. So what's the deal here, huh? 16 WIOD. Three mature modulation. Hi, it's P. We Herman. Take it from me. They don't come any better than Neil Rogers. Today's fast-paced world holds its share of headache. There's a thumbprint on this report. Don't get it. Oh, yes sir. Got a problem? No, sir. And under some pressure, huh? Yeah, I feel like my head's going to explode and ask for a doesn't do anything. Well here, take some. I've you profane. I've you profane. Well, try anything. I'm dirty rotten stuff. I'm put up. The big thing he's talking to. I don't make it little. Do we it on report? Feel better? Yeah. What's the inner of you profane? Well, nothing we can admit to on the radio except our secret ingredient, screw them all. Which eliminates any inhibitions you might have about saying what's on your mind. Oh, here comes your boss. Look, I want this report done, even if you have to work through your lunch hour. Okay? What are the nuts? What are you going to get off your, to do some work around here? Oh, I see you take ibuprofen. Yeah. I take it too. You lazy pieces. Oh, no, gentle. The crap. I do something. I use only a spoon to wrap it. 1023 and WIT. So anyway, let's start with Pat Curry, our good-closed personal friend who now pedals her crap to the Harold as the radio writer for the Harold, a son, sent a little bluer ass out some ashes over the Harold. Is she still right? I didn't see the piece. Oh, Puts? I didn't see the Puts piece. So what were they talking to her about? What does she know about anything? They let her get like a certain same. Yeah, I got a sense for her 10 to 20. Bitch. So anyway, Ron and Ron are off Zeta for a cast and over and brewer replaced them. Fans of radio's raucous Ron and Ron. Sure, when for a disappointing drive time today, the city hit a show with drop Tuesday by Zeta 4. Zeta 4 and its owner, Packs and Communications announced Tuesday after knowing that the 6 to 10 a.m. show had been replaced. Effective today by South Florida radio veterans, Paul Castro no balls and Ron Brewer. Packs had also dropped the show Tuesday from its Jacksonville station, but it continues on the air on the it's Orlando affiliate. I didn't know that. They owned a station in Orlando that it's on. So what does that mean? I don't understand what that whole that means. In addition to which if they were dropping the show because DS's wife has got AIDS, how come they're leaving it on here in Orlando? Probably because the contract is enough for renewal. I would imagine, but Pat Curry doesn't go to delve in deeply enough to give us that information. I'm sure somebody in the audience like the Phantom and former can let us know what to deal with with that. In response, Ron and Ron show official's issued a news release implying that the show had been dropped as a result of an honor announcement in December that Ron DS's wife Debbie is suffering from AIDS. We're surprised because we had already told Packs and Communications that were going through a transitional phase. Cohost Ron Benington said, we told them that Ron would have to miss some dates because of his wife's illness and they told us we had the full support and love of Packs and the full support and love of his holy highness. Mr. Born again, Mr. Holyer than now, Mr. I would stab my grandmother in the back if I could make a few bucks on it, buddy. But another one of these good born again, Chris Denz with this $12 million house. $12 million house, people are starving on the streets in this man is building a goddamn $12 million house attribute to greed and being a good born again, Christian with his Christian manual. I wonder if Paul Kestler always read that baby yet because it is mandatory reading Paul. You're going to have to turn into an immediate J. Barker. No touching below the waist, no touching above the waist, no touching anything. Hands behind your back, or straight up in the air. Anico Zano about the ratings in a sened and about Neil Mercky, the program director says it was a matter of ratings. They were off. They were going down. Papa, Papa. And then of course there's a son Sentinel spin on it, which the son Sentinel on page 2B or not to be or 2A on the inside people and those stern bumps Ron and Ron. Which ain't even mentioned basically in the other article. But the Melissa Rujieri, which is Rogers and Italian, Chris, remember the family. Stern bumps Ron and Ron just four months after invading the San Florida radio market. How the Howard Stern show has claimed it's first casually. The first of many Melissa were all going off the air because Howard's on here in Miami as in, oh, we're all packing up our little kid bag and leaving. Now, Melissa, you stupid bitch. WZTA home of the one time ratings grabbers, Ron Diaz and Ron Benington officially severed its ties with the duo syndicated morning show on Tuesday. One of several changes the station will unveil today. According to Neil Mercky, program director for Zayda, the station had been searching for a new morning program even before stern ended the market in September on WBGGGG, which that now that's that's bull crap. I don't believe that for a second. They were kicking ass. They had gigantic numbers. Why the hell would they put it different morning show on? See, why do you have to line Neil? Why do you have to be as the public? Ratings transindicate Ron and Ron's often crude show had declined from a 4.8 to a 3.5 year, over a two month span by comparison two months after his arrival stern boosted WBG G. G's morning ratings to a 5.5 year from the 1.3 year of the station held over the summer when it was WACC FM. The full arbitrom ratings fall book which covers September through to several booths released about two weeks. Stirring may or may not have been a fact when Ron and Ron's decline murky said they've been sliding for a long time in the decision to carry the show anymore was purely a rating thing. Packs and communication which owns Zayda will also yank Ron and Ron from its sister affiliate in Jacksonville. They do always tap a base show it aired on Zayda since 1993 will continue to serve its nine other affiliate markets including Tampa and Orlando. And then it was on about Castra Nova and Brure. So anyway, then here's the press release from Zayda. Boy, I got just crap up the old shoot here this morning. Ron and Ron devastated after being dropped in Miami and Jacksonville after AIDS announcement says the press release from their corporate offices unbelievable. Then actually syndicated radio program, the Ron and Ron show is devastated after being notified today that it is being dropped by Packs and Communications Corp Stations in Miami and Jacksonville after making the much publicized on air announcement prior to their Christmas holidays that Ron DS is wife Debbie a suffering from the AIDS virus. The Ron and Ron show hosted by Bob I will continue to serve Bob I Bob. We are shocked and said in the Ron and Ron show a service of these markets extremely well. We have a very strong bond with a thousands and thousands of loyal Ron and Ron listeners and promised to be back on a year as soon as possible with another radio station which is why they were sucking up with me by the way and also over here. Remember that business with the with the AIDS announcement and about the best of stuff and peaches? What to be appreciate they help by the way but I don't think the motivation was quite as honorable as it was made to sound. We feel as though we've been as matter of fact I happened to know, be on a shadow of a doubt that they were sniffing around to try to get them on this station a little bird whispered that through the door. We feel as though we've been left down after Packs and Communications at Pledge to Was There full and complete support as late as last Friday the program director of Zayda and Miami told me that they were committed to us as their morning show and that podcast for no one would be doing after known. We obviously underestimate their level of support and their amount of lying. You see again because they operate by that good Christian creedow over their own Zayda. They would never lie to you unless of course in this case. This time, this time I'll make an exception. Okay, this time only you can ask me about my business. Just like Michael Corleon, the same the odd father strikes again. Let's take a call from sunrise and you're going to take a look at this. Hey, hello. How you doing Neil? Okay. I just got to tell you one thing. Yes. I usually watch the dolphins on TV even though I'm not a dolphin. Yes, but I was working out in the yard on Sunday and I listened to your new broadcast crew. Our new broadcast crew. Yeah, you mean on the game? Yeah, on the game. You mean, uh, Bill Zimford? Yes, Zimford. For us in flute? Yeah. Yeah, but I get to tell you where they held this man that's come from. What does that mean? Well, what does that mean? Where did he come from? I think he's the old tight-end man old number 88. Yeah, well, he's the great former tight-end man. Does he suck? What does that mean? You're knocking the mad dog now. Everybody loves marriage. In fact, he was in the building yesterday when Aaron Summers came in and said, look at the son of a blonde man. Yeah, only she's not blonde, but hey, he wasn't looking at her here. I'm telling you, I will never listen to an early dolphin game when a station is long as he well, why should you be different from anybody else? That's why they're on television. Yeah, well, God, I've just had to get this off my chest. Okay. Well, feel better. Okay, kind of middle-aged you get the snow. Calls in here, riffs the mad dog and he wants he wants me to give him shenlers list. This guy is out. He's history man. He is off ripping my good buddy Jim Mandage. Yes. Boy, talk about Hutspa. Oh, geez. Oh. Okay. We got just too much crap around here today. What is this? Here's a this is from today. A judge has ordered professional football player Cleveland Gary. Whatever happened to Cleveland Boy, Gary anyway, by the way, speaking to the dolphins and his wife to pay American Express more than $35,000 in back charges. Remember that story that's been an ongoing thing. Pay up already. Okay, pay it now and cut the crap. He's got to pay $13,000 $576 is wife Simone got a repay $22,000. The credit card company sued an October claiming they'd failed to pay their $28,842 bill on their American Express gold cards since February of 1993. February of 93 and this is goddamn January of 95. And God don't know how much money that often is just handed away for him useless as as teach on a frog. And in the meantime, he's just hanging on probably sold all that good stuff that they bought. What does this brought the best of 94? It kicks serious ass as in Managed It says this fact. So raise a crap up above. Jay Barker is uglier than Al Goldstein's ass. Jay Barker is uglier than Al Goldstein's ass. Yes. Okay, big. See, takes the helmet off. And out of the way that there's from what we heard yesterday, another born again Christian was running around shouting from the mountain tops. I'm a virgin. I'm a virgin. I never do not man. I never touch that thing. I don't want to know nothing from that thing. And then we hear yesterday that he's a booser and Carouser and banging everything on campus is what we heard. Now that's just a rumor. But what do you believe? Folks, here's Miami. Hello. Yeah. Good man. Uh, just hanging in here. I had this trickle here was one of the chances list. But um, she wanted one. She wanted a chance. She was a little bit less. Uh, tell her to forget it. Yeah, I know. Is she Jewish? Well, she's Jewish. Yeah. What else are the things she took from us? Yeah, probably not. But I'm going to make sure she gets sick of herself. Then she gets it. Yeah. I'm sure she'll get it. Yeah. Hey, what's happening with the tickets man? With a lot tickets. Always be Lord, where we both want to tickets now. They hoping on my home, you'd be San Diego and the two really losers. I didn't see nothing about any tickets today. I've been on for half an hour. I'm saying one word about it. I've been wondering about it. I've been wondering. I've been mentioning the fact that you still have the perfect ticket. I don't want anything. Good. I'm just good for how long. Okay, let's go to Cooper City. Hello. How long is Sonny? Yeah, I'm an old Jewish man. Uh-huh. Actually, I was listening to the ball out of 45 hour live. What is it?

What else is name George? Go ahead. So I was listening to Phil Henry yesterday. Yeah. The first time I ever found him to be funny. He was a star. Well, what are you people all talking about the first time you ever heard him to be funny? You're out. You're off the air pal. Yeah. All these people that we got a whole new deal, man. This must be uh, this must be Paxon's people over here called into the trying to flood the lines with BS here. First guy's ripping mandage. Who everybody loves mandage, right? Yeah, there you go. Even old sower pie over there. And now he's ripping into Phil Henry. One of the great talents in the history of our business. The first time he ever heard, why did you call him and tell him that you spinalist piece of turd? You walking jellyfish? Call him and tell him that. God, Almighty, talk about I see here I go through a 33 minute monologue. These people would know Ron and Ron from uh, from uh, they would know Don I'mus from Don Amichi. They would know Tony Segretto from Tony Alamo. Jesus Joseph and Mary. We're in Hell, all these old just because I said we want to hear from old farts. It was a joke. Okay. Go away. Please. Oh, hey.

They were lovely and you're still a douchebag. Thanks a lot. That's okay. Why? Because you uh, I don't want to go through that whole thing again. Can't you move on with your life now? No, we'll can't you stop saying something about it? I haven't said a word about it. This is when you were talking about the dolphin. Yeah. And it's true. It's true. I give things away. I have valuable things to give away here once in a great while. Sometimes which I purchase with my own cash and then I give away to people who don't use them or just taking for granted or even worse, lose them or make up some cock and bull story about losing them. It wasn't up or sorry. It was a bull and cock story about it was. Huh? No, it was. It was a well-known truth. Well, regardless of somebody did pick them up off the desk, if that bitch left them on a desk like that, it was pretty careless to do something like that. I'd slap her ass around a little bit. Well, I take those flowers and stick the stems right where the mundo shine. Turn her ass into a flower pot. I'm serious. I'll never forget that as long as I live. Fine with me. Have a nice day. Boy, have we tested the waters here today? Are they in a good mood today or what? Huh? Yeah. It's 1036. That you're happiness station. Happy New Year, by the way, for this is a great way.

Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? What is it? I had a radio accident today on the continental's worst vision. Oh boy, they got the worst cable. They got no channels with pain for no channels. On channel 17, they had these people that were like over 185 years old, they're doing calisthenics in the in the in the in the in the in chair. Yeah. We'll share calisthenics. Yeah. Reach up turned to dawn up through the shuffle back and forth while I sitting down. That's only for sunrise. That's only for the people in sunrise. They have that walker aerobics is good at talking about. Have you ever seen it? Yeah. They do aerobics on your walk. I thought I was, I thought I was totally a could not believe what was seen on the TV unbelievable. Yeah. Not able vision is put well, they're all appealing to people who you know who believe the canning has a different meaning that what my with a Michael Faith.

He didn't make it on the years uh, remember a big list. Faded off into obscurity. Once they found out he was doing drugs and was a punky little piece of crap and had a real bad complexion and didn't look as good as we thought in the first place. He was kind of like the Jay Barker of drugs. The Jay Barker of canings, you know, from far away like over in Singapore. He looked you know who's all right. And then all of a sudden we saw close up. He was a real piece of crap. I think Larry King was the one who exposed that facade. Just like he exposed Ross for having those big ears. Right Larry, you idiot you suck hole. suck hole of the year. Once again goes to Larry King. Oh, just looking and uh, lathering up all over everybody's body, which is why they did their lined up at the door to be on that show for those marshmallow roasts. Here's Kendall. Hello. Hey, Neil, how are you doing? Okay. This is your just a Cuban prostate fat. Yeah. How is it? Mine is fine. How's yours? Mine's uh, okay. You know, was hurting a little bit over the holiday because I had a little bit of liquid entertainment. Oh, but um, by the way, I have a little uh recommendation for all you mail prostate sufferers out there. My mother, my mother finally after spewing up bull crap all these years. Finally told me something true yesterday and that is stay away from Citrusville. You know, your doctor always tells you to take like a little, uh, I hate to say stool soften or laxative because that makes you sound like a real old fart. But the bottom line is don't take that Citrus else got citric acid in it. And like over the weekend, I thought, oh, gee, I'm getting all better from this thing. It's just about 98% gone and starting all over again. She said, throw that crap out. It's got citric acid in it. It will tear your insides out. I threw it out and I'm feeling great. Yeah, anything that's acid. That's right. We're hurting. So watch your acid in the prostate too. If you have prostate problems, watch your acid. Listen, anybody even if you name ain't said, anybody who calls your show ripping, managed, I hope he gets a word on the top of his head. It's a stupid thing. It's obnoxious. You jackass right. If it wasn't for managed, you know what the show will be like. That's right. He's the only thing that keeps the goddamn game on me. That anybody would listen for the sure not listening for a comma to his in for their listening demanded. It's despised at anything up and go ape shot. Yeah. There you go. I rest my cases. Well, Neil, I just want to see how your thing was doing in your prostate too. They're both excellent. But I'm actually running out of material. Obviously, it's okay. Have a great life. I feel like if you're a finger on it. We have an open line in date 751 and one on the bell soft mobility line, which amazingly, I'm one in Broward. It looks like three. Just when I thought we were starting to build up some gigantic momentum. And who wants the Shindler's list damn thing? I want to get rid of this. It's a double a two for one deal. Two of VCR of V yeah, two VCRs. Two of videos. How long is that damn thing anyway? Boy, you talk about morbid. That must go on and on and on. Three hours and 17 minutes of self pity. Oh my god. It just goes on. Huh? You're not going to watch it. Why do I want to watch it? It's a good movie. I don't want to see it. I watch all I watch all those damn A and E. And I watch all of those that I've seen 80 million. I watch public public television, whether no English likes it or not. I watch 800,000 hours of Holocaust movies. I know all about it. I've seen all the bones. I know all I don't know. Nobody has to convince me that it happened. I'm as well aware as anybody except maybe those people who were survivors and were there. I know all about it. I don't need to see any more. It's not a documentary. What is it? It's a good story. It's a story about this guy. I know what it is, Mr. Goia, show cup. I know all about it. I don't need some little goi sitting in there tell me about some Jewish movie. I know all about it. They don't have no, you're thinking of Europa. You're open now. No, this movie. I don't want to see any naked men. I want to see naked Jews. I want to see naked goi. I want to see Jay Barker dripping wet in the locker room and see just just what the real story. The inside story is there with that punk. That thing is probably like a purple at this point. It's probably raw as a beat. A lot of naked old people. There you go. Any horny old queens out there. A lot of naked guys in this. Over the age of 100. Here's the four-laterdale. Hello. Good morning, Mr. Sir. Back to you. Hey, I took your advice. And got the autobiography, the unauthorized. Oh, the Michael Jackson book. Who? Yeah. Talk about height. Yeah. Unbelievable. He's doing it. He's still doing it. Yeah. There's not going to be too many people that'll stop him. He's got the do. He's got the bucks and that part about the, if you finished the book. No. Did you give it to the part where Latoya was going through the closet in the house and never land. And she found all these a canceled checks like for a million here in Tumili in there. They written the parents of all his little boy friend. I read it. Well, hey. And it's just like that woman that was on her wild along. Never forget this line as long as I live. She comes on here and gives stands up very indignant big fat black woman. And says, I'd be proud to have my son molested by Michael Jackson. What kind of a statement is there? What kind of an ambassador do you have to be to make a statement like that? Well, see you. In other words, if it was father-in-law tool, that would be a sin and you know, who is asked and so the church, but if Michael the molested, then it's a wonderful thing. It must be okay. He probably even used that sequence. I love to do it. He's driving a new life role. Oh, yeah. Right. There you go. He's rolling it. Hey, why not? Have you noticed how good Rick's answer is? Look, lately. I don't watch that station under penalty of death. Do you know, occasionally I flip it on? How good he looks has compared the water of what green turd? You know, he just has a slimy slick hair. His complexion was kind of a... Yeah, but Jay Hiler bunched him up on. He's going to be the best man at that wedding. In fact, Jay Hiler said he's the best man. He's had in a long time. So whatever that means, you're figuring it out. I thought it was Marilyn Mithle. Anya. Thought it was one? Marilyn Mithle. You know the health reporter? I don't want to see him. I don't know who any of those people are. What will say, Gway back? He's getting married to Jessica Aguri. Can't us must, Macho, Jessica Aguri are and Bishop. Yeah, but is he circumcised? Uh, you're about the only one who wants to know. Have a great life, pal and go back and read the book. Obviously, you need something to keep you busy. Anybody that's obsessed with Rick Sanchez needs serious serious help. Just the aroma about those 20 gallons of oil. Wow. It's a 1047. You know, I'm a smell that over here and they're like several yards away. 1047 a WIOD. How's Jay Hiler doing by the way? And if they set the date yet, now we invited? Is the paper boy going to be the best man? He won't be the first man, but he might be the best man. 16 WIOD. The biggest Dick and South Florida. Kids, you say hang out at the beach in Singapore, but beach boys are up. Hang in the past. Now, case mail records gives you the chance to meet the new generation, the mall boy. Well, we spend a lot of time hanging out, but we don't buy a thing now. And the muffle leaves head is what we know they can't do the thing now. Why not grab your woody and hang with a mall boy? Just grab much is now. I think I could eat a cow from it to prove to me. The mall boys are they ain't unless you cast a drip on the pair to be your life or are they just waiting for their parents to pick them up in the beaver? Well, I like to walk around and smoke a cigarette. And I think I look tough, but I haven't started shaving yet. The mall boys, they're not a lost generation because you can always buy them at the mall. When I grow up I'll be in forever and the one. The level two. 1051 and WIOD and let's see. We haven't given away the shindlers list yet. I want this off of my hands immediately if not sooner. Let's get rid of it. Here's for a lot of nail. Hello. Neil, how you doing? Okay. Hey, listen. I woke up up in the corner that shindlers list because when I saw the movie, yeah, recognize my great of my grandfather was one of the cards. Well, one of the Nazi generals. I know most people call a grandfather was a Nazi general. Yeah, and they showed him in a real life clip of the movie. I almost predicted the third movie. What was his name, Marshall Limbaugh senior? No, no, no, no, no. Oh, I'm short, cop. Anyway, Neil. Yeah, I'm always still on. I know what's amazing. Keep going. Anyway, Neil, so I was when I realized I saw the dollar movie theater at the AMC Ridge once. And when I stood up and said, you know, Marshall, that's Grandpa out there. I would use turn around and they were like, you know, looking at me as a son. Smart move. Yeah, smart move. And you're still here to tell the tale. So, you know, we were in a game to the. Hey, yeah, I'm probably good. I was. Anyway, I know it's not right because I know what he did was wrong and stuff. And I just like that. I'm a movie set of one clip of them, you know, because he wasn't. And over here, you're the grandson of a Nazi and you want me to give you this movie. Do you realize what a disgusting and grotesque act that would be in my part? But Neil, listen, I mean, I didn't say you're not getting it. I just want to ask if you understood how disgusting and revolting that would be. Why do you want to see it? It's not really disgusting or voting because he was a great general. He was a great general. Hermon Geering. He chose of Germals. George Goble. When he was so alive and I was young, I asked him and he said he regretted it and he was forced to do it. Yeah. So, I don't have. I never have a picture of him, you know, he's a gas scientist and they would all pet well. He's dead now. Yeah. Yeah. You're great. You're also a... I am. That's why I thought... This would be even I can't stoop this low. Can I give it to this guy, George? He's making it all up. You're making it up, George said. What was his name? What was your grandfather's name? Gentle, sports, call. Okay. I told you he was making it up. You're lying, sack, a crap. And I want to look, if you got to make up, I'll give it to anybody. But to make up stories, this is bad. If they're doing for tickets or something for a ball game, that's one thing. But now you're making it up stories to get a goddamn video tape. I mean, that's pathetic. You can go ahead and it's shock buzzed if we're only about 100 bucks. And if your Jewish 200 bucks, oh, sorry Wayne. We have an open line in Broward 5249 for, sorry, creator-posts. How's the runner-run doing, by the way? Got nothing. You know, something, why did I waste all that time on that? We haven't had one call about that. Nobody gives a crap about that, evidently. We didn't get one call about it. Nothing, not a, not a one. Zip any doodot. Here's Miami. Hello. Run in run, finally gun. Oh. Thanks Howard. We have an open line in date, 751. Who the hell was that? Sounded like a familiar voice to me. As in perhaps, hey, it's Howard. How it's bam. Let's see, Miami's gone. Let's do a lady in Boca. Hello. Hello. Yes. This is a little bit political. I think on the only person that's outraged about these Cuban refugees who escaped from Belgrade prison, convicted first degree murders. What? What? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. My psychotic friend. What? What? What? There vines is a make with that they're Cuban refugees. I'm not, not Cuban. I'm saying any refugee. Just these five happen to be Cuban. Yeah. And that's what the, what have you, what's opened up this? Yeah, out of here. She wants to start that crap all over again. Go call up. Amy, shape. Okay. Go call up the school teacher. Call up. Enus the penis. Sure. Call him up. Once I start all that crap again. Yeah. We already know that nobody knows it better than I did. He sent every, uh, the general, every douchebag, every devious dangerous crew. We know that. So go scream at Lardass Limbo. Okay. Laptor, tada, tada, tada, go scream at his fat ass. Get out of my post. Why is it? You notice 99% of the time, it's women. The women in this town. They're like, I've sest with this with this, but call up Sandy paint and she'll be delighted to hear about it. Okay. Call up Sandy and just say, oh, you're so right, lovely lady and have a nice day. There you go. One more time, Sandy. Have a nice day. Oh, she still hasn't lost it. Has she that's Serapy, phony, jappy sound. And also I'm not getting any of something. I better don't get one call about this today. But off the year, everybody that I everybody I run into comes up to me and says, boy, you sure are right about that. The, any of them is only one example of it. Deonsanders would be another. But of course, deonsanders is a professional look it up in the book. So there's not too much you can do about that. Even though it's still just as disgusting and nauseating or people are laughing at him like some kind of a like some kind of a jackass who ought to know better. But these guys, I mean, on a college level, if the coach and the athletic director, the people in charge don't have an up control over these assholes out there to say, hey, this this looks like crap. This is pathetic. You guys look like how much an asshole is doing this crap. Strutting around like step and fetch it. And with all this trash talk in the fighting and all the other garbage that you, and then of course the fans of all that stuff, the Kingsman, it couldn't win if they didn't do that. Yeah, right. That has a lot to do with athletic ability and with competing on a field and being articulate and literate and educated, etc. And so on, which of course being articulate and educated and literate are some of the things that nobody wants to talk about in this society, especially if you happen to be minority and especially if you happen to be black, don't get an education, just go out there and kick some ass. There you go. And be pissed off. That's what it's all about. And everybody else is laughing Erass off. And at the meantime, this is like the apinical of success is to go out there in the strut around like some kind of an asshole on in heat. And it's pathetic. Kendall. And you know, yes, we look for safe and convenient on the FM. Now, should we look for why? They've been in the Queen for what? And said it's going on charges. What, what are they going to be on? On, you said, well, yesterday, Castro and Ovis do in mornings over there, Ron and Ron around. I mean, that's the switch, huh? Yes, they, the coast was going back to the city. That was it. You can't add it here. The sky is falling. Oh my god, how is it possible for there to be so many stupid people in the world? How is it possible for there to be so many parats out there? Do you think for yourself? Do you have a brain? Is there anything functioning? Is there a function at your junction? My god. You said this. Yeah, the sky is falling. I got $6 million in a briefcase. I'm going to send over to your right after lunch. Warren Moon is a, is a clutch performer, a new King, which is a genius who's going to lead us out of the wilderness into progressive America. What, what are you talking about, man? Let me ask you something, man? Are you a moron or what? Was that Ron and moron on the phone? I said yesterday, Herman and Ben Bean start next Monday and a morning. I don't want to get David K. Schwartz up, said over there on the coast. WGTR. He even got the monkey back in here, and the think I've got to be for Michael Jackson shaved his ass. Boy, just in the nicotine. Oh, that, that call right there. You marked that one for the posterity. That was astonishing. You said just through, yeah, yeah, I say a lot of crap. Okay, you've got to be able to pick and choose between a crap and the truth. And truth is something we know nothing about on this station. Although we were the first ones to tell you about Paul Castro Nova and about Zeta and every other guy damn thing that happens in his market. Right? Damn right, freaking A. Here's homestead on the Sterlin. Hello. Morning. Morning to you. I want to say it was the guy who called earlier saying that yesterday was the first day he found, uh, uh, Phil funny. Yeah.

Here's Pompito Beach. Hello. Hi. Is this nine four six three? This is it, Sunny. You know Sally's brothers. So huge. The only thing I can think of the compared to would be the size of Russian windball head. Yeah, like I said, like Russia is Russia's ass on a bad day. If you're seeing a size that head, I mean, I accidentally turned the channel and it took a whole damn screen. Who hers her his? I've never seen his head nor do I have any desire to see it. Well, Neil, this is a red red. I think anybody could find it. We have an open line in date 75 one one and Broward five two four one on the green line one eight hundred did he get cut off? He started talking at head stuff and he got cut right off. That's a shame. He is off limits. Now he's out. When do you agree? He's you are beyond chronic. You have nothing to say. You're beyond chronic. You must. I'm going to do your big favor seriously. I'm going to force you. Even if it feels bad in the beginning, just like a little less than him, I'm going to force you to find a life. Even if it hurts, you must find a hobby. Badminton would be good. You can go out there and play with that old shuttlecock. You can take up a surfing would be great. All the way. I think shuffleboard might be the board that you're looking for. Whatever it is, just grab it and go with it. But go somewhere and do a fast grab. Go away. Please. In fact, maybe let me limo driver pick you up. And the two of you can have a long chat about chronic doses. Oh my god. He's just out of control. And just, you know, it kind of starts sailing right along. Oh, this is great. Get out of here. When one thing I don't like on this show is chronicosis man. I don't want no chronic. It's the kissadeth. I don't want to hear no talk show where you have the same goddamn half dozen people every day who have nothing to say. The same old people like old Bonnie from candle. Now Bonnie's bringing in the family. The got some of his bus has moving down here so she can line up the verbal artillery down there. And then it was sandy and Bobby and this one and now all these front running phony's who are looking your ass one day and then all of a sudden the next day before even washing it off they're looking somebody else's. I think that's disgusting, rotesk and certainly hazardous to your health. 1232, see it's not 1232. I just do that time to see if you'd react. It is somewhere like probably out in the middle of the ocean. It's 1232. Maybe in the Bahamas Mon, maybe in Brazil. You know what I haven't played in a long time and I'm just dying for it right now. Like time Hopkins would say I'm really horny for it right now. Where the hell is it? Played a little clip from it but I haven't played the whole uh like I said anytime I'm looking for something for get it. You know it's gonna be gone. Although in this particular case I just happen to uh finger it right now. Hey Can you imagine the Andres Cater and managed together that would be a broadcast man you'd have to get new speakers after every game I quite into you that 1133 a WIOD 16 WIOD delivering daily without boarding sickness.

Sorry Oliye just did joke as he signals on which horse is going to win the race. Right fat rich ride at a boy richy you're so full of it man it's coming out your nose and I just don't understand I told you that they wouldn't respond to that I mean forget about the guys holding hands in a hotel they won't talk about that they don't want to think about it but the fact that these uh and why is it that only black players are allowed to do that is that just come natural that the step and fetch it routine and all that givers crap and then getting down kneeling in the end zone and uh doing all that stuff is that is that a black thing did Alex Haley write about that so you don't want to say it either but we're gonna say well it would work too well I don't I don't know but why do they want to that's my point I don't understand it because everybody else is laughing at that just like when people are illiterate and can't express themselves people don't respect that they frown upon it and nobody wants to get that message across it's kind of like you know this is the way things are supposed to be by design and it's uh said that nobody you know and uh I'm telling you it's just and the same thing with Frank Cost to get an nail for losing that game the other day not that I want to rehash the fact that Nebraska beat Miami New Orange ball but what is that because he's Italian do we have some kind of an I'm gonna call you out Italian definitely right now I'm gonna get on the phone right now the same people who were very very right in protesting against the godfather I remember when Joe dodgyola who grew up on day go hell can I say that in St. Louis with Yogi Burra he did

timer into a talk up what kind of town does that take the kind of town that you find on FM that's the kind none bunch of voices all so much a kid carries all sound the same man no talent no personality no not nothing we have an open line in date 75 I'm sorry 9463 and what on a green line in 9463 here's a lady in key largo hello he logo I've been waiting so long I'm almost in for the city I'm on the stretch all right you're making progress you're almost heading towards civilization and if you keep going a few hundred miles you'll make it I know you know several times I've ever called you why not I just we know I think it's because you get so used to hearing you all the time yeah and I know I got this mobile but I never call but the thoughts that bell sounds is gonna pull out all of a sudden this morning I'm in a feeding frenzy it is scary when you feel that they're gonna pull out that's right you know can I say something about the Miami doll you can say whatever you like this is America until Congress convenes today you can say whatever you like I think they're playing great ball and I just can't wait for the day when Jimmy Johnson coaches the team oh right so I didn't wait for three years yeah I keep thinking when's it gonna happen here's another vote against rain stem shoo like I can't believe it I've been that way for four years but nobody wants to hear me yeah you know up until a year ago when you said that it was like they were gonna dump my own more teaming on my head but now people are willing to listen now they're willing out there all uh Johnson for it yeah yeah I can't I just really run Eric since through the ring are here please go right ahead I think at the team now about before you go into that and well maybe that's what you're gonna talk about are you gonna respond to what I said about the Javasd Turkey's out there in the field I can like a bunch of assholes no why not you don't you know because I don't think that's the issue the issue in the area I didn't see whether it's the issue but you certainly must have a feeling about that that you probably do not wish to articulate that so yeah you want to do that play great ball I'm saying more power to it oh I don't agree but it is time to shut it it's time to shut it down and get down to the game you can have what do you want to do what does that mean they lie it's a college football team they lost the couple of games I mean do they have to win every week but that's not the issue do they have to win every week to get a few fans to show up yeah what is it what is it what is his story be sad he drinks too much milk what is the problem with that he's already isn't okay go go when when a team when a bunch of young men who are playing trying to play their hard out anyway I don't think you like his I don't think you like his kids complexion that's the problem his son's got that crater face too I don't know I never thought about that but I've never thought about was that his son that's not his son Craig Erickson that's not Dennis Erickson's son I don't know about Craig Erickson I don't think so he's got a kid that plays football that wasn't his son wasn't George I'm listening but I'm interspersing some interesting stuff and with the two go ahead well my problem with Erickson is that these guys are like a little more than halfway through the season yeah he starts talking about entertaining other coaching jobs yeah what kind of way is that to act what do you mean they're having when you win a minute when he's you're a minute when did he say that when did he say that when the how did he say that what about a month or so or a month and a half ago he was looking around he didn't say that a new year he didn't say I heard him saying during the season he said it and walk away well well we'll pack a masonry genoclasm milk I think so Jimmy Johnson back at um yeah well no I don't know who's gonna coach you am in the end but the defensive coach I think does a fine job he'd make a good hit coach okay let's bring Garnt's barger in the coach you have it let's bring in let's bring in Joe paterno let's bring big up what he he would never find him he would never
