with these people taking over Miami who are these people who are these people well the people from Cuba the Haitians foreigner the foreigners okay what are they coming to town foreigner well you know yeah well sounds a little precise yeah so what does that mean taking over let me tell you something when people move out you know why the whole area right up the street here at 79th of the scale you know why that area is the way it is today because everybody else moved out that's why no because we have weak repersoned case no it's got nothing to do with representation of anything it's got to do with people running away and moving out okay and moving up to places like plantation acres way out west there well that's by the way it's pretty nice there yeah believe it is but a small solution to something that I guess what if you think you're gonna move away from anything go out of the saw grass mall which is right next door to my house and you'll find every foreigner who's ever been born nobody in there speaks it in place so what are you talking about well this is a small solution that I came up with I read it in an article it's great cater to them there keep them there because I sure

had went through all this bilingual crap and through the immigration and the Marylle which was a nightmare I agree with that but I mean but the women now that's all they still want to talk about what if we talked about that we could do just like Sandy we could do 50 hours on bilingualism and smelly nasty Cubans every goddamn day here and never never have a shortage of women callers but if we want women callers on anything else oh they're they're not out there they're busy out with their soap opera they're busy with O.

center of your face well here's our simple method for correcting that problem just take a look at some of our first graduates candy Crowley Red Butler Mary Natalie Bonnie Ray and of course the lovely

of i talas to go around you're gonna be a real beauty and the van Sustrin i love it and of course the timing could be better because we heard from Greta of Von Bron only a moment ago in a last hour that the disgusting smelly German bitch now i will confess yes i do have many prejudices but when it comes to Germans that i put very up high on the list i'm not saying that there aren't some nice German people i have a met too many but i'm sure in fact why was a little kid we had Germans their name was Schultz lived right on the corner next door to our house those Schultzers they had an even their little dog was an Nazi i'm serious they had a little nasty uh what the kind of a dog was it of German? no no little dog little like kind of like tiny only a more obnoxious if that's possible a little white dog and he would bark out and it would sound like sea giles you could hear it in the barking the dog was trained to be a guy named Nazi and used to put his paw at a 45 degree angle up in the air as you would come outside and make anti-semitic slurs because he would happen to be and the people of next door to what their name was fly sure which is a very Jewish name and it was a very uncomfortable thing when he used to have those rallies out there in the street corner boy two bad that Papu cannon wasn't around then and rick Riley here's plantation acres on the purple line hello

what Vadimi Kinnervic a line change I mean it stops play of course you make a line change oh they do it right when that penalty is well the guy doesn't just go in the penalty box in the game keeps going on they stop play right generally when there's a penalty when the one team gets the power play and the other team is sure to hand it there's always almost always a shift change because you know you want to put on your penalty killers and they want to put on their big line if they're not out there already okay got it okay we have an open line on the purple line welcome to hockey tough baby

he has a very disturbing fact it says dear Neil I have a deep dilemma that chronic Greg from Pompano slash boiting beat who keeps vaccine wallet and trying to call your show and is over at Q AM and dragged me along with him on Sunday has got a crush on me and keeps trying to hit on me right during the show at Q AM he tried to penetrate me right in front of the talk show host Phil Latsman it was a very embarrassing event and I don't know what to do about it all my friends are discussing this although I am quite attracted him and perhaps may allow him to do it next time he tries what do you think your friend Andy in bonaventure you think Andy should get together with Greg maybe that might take work out their frustrations together we probably have some penetrating thoughts on this here's a piggy port a mobile in western hello hey good morning Neil yes sir pigs are out and bound on travel club that's it sound club road in western yes that's it thank you so much sir hey care i have a great day bye bye open line in Broward 5 2 4 9 4 6 3 so maybe we can get some kind of like advice to love Lauren the comments from our audience out here for Andy and Greg obviously are having a far enough parting of the ways or not maybe they're having a meeting of the minds a meeting of the meat here's Miami Beach hello hello yeah yes I am I'm very disturbed you know that obviously that bitch that called up about the Germans you know I was a POW in Germany every shutdown and believe me then that you're going to be careful when they smile boy watch out for yeah watch out be honest with you that I was in Berlin once and I never saw anybody smile well they're my fellow very content smile but believe me they they don't like this they may think that we're good and they tell us how good we are what do you mean us either the Jews or the Americans what I was saying yeah well I you know the man I was a Jew in Germany and POW camp and believe me it was not comfortable yeah anyways about that's what Andy from my bodyventures said he said it was not comfortable you know about uh oh Jay what disturbs me is I think he is guilty but however there's no blood no there's no lot of blood around him I mean where is all his clothes you know in a bag somewhere you have to ask out columns about that it's in the bag man yeah well that's the bag man a cure McCallel I don't know I I doubt very much of he could do it that fast because what he mean if he had a shovel and a big plastic sack in the uh Bronco why is it unreasonable to believe that he had a duffel bag well that's possible that's possible that he had a change when he was driving back because there's very short time frame right between the act and when he was back to his house in the in the limousine right about 15 minutes yeah well that's you know that's just 20 minutes to clean up you know yeah there must have been blood all over this well there was a bloody sock upstairs he kind of left a little trail you know he went outside and he tried to bury the he tossed the glove and he went into a panic and then he ran inside and by that time he obviously he had taken all the stuff off and the toss the sweater whatever he was wearing in the assac yeah well you know that also the tossing the glove that that that that's no sense I mean what the hell I mean he didn't toss it he just the probably dropped it you think he really dropped it he dropped it or who downloads what he did yeah because that's that's that's that's the stir is me I know he's guilty but you know how how do you get these facts together that's I think that's going to be a problem he's going to get off anyways I would worry he's going to walk you right yeah and then he's going to run like a son of a bitch he always could run like hell even with those bad arthritic knees you watch him run yeah he's going to make a lot of money to buy you bad damn thing and he's a book you'll have a movie he'll have his own goddamn show he'll be bigger than Jenny Jones I'll tell you that's right and they have a great day amigo thanks a lot see yeah we have an open line in day 75 one I mean guys Jewish and I'm calling him amigo it's state county it's part of the ambiance here and all you Cuban haters man call up sandy patence you'll be glad to have your call and so probably we enforce everything you like everything you want to say man she'll repeat it boy oh boy some of these people are just keep harboring this uh this this bitter this has a nice day exactly sandy lovely lady you tell him bitch let's talk about sandy patenawala okay and about how all the people had worked here including Roger Magdalene and in Microneri they probably wouldn't admit it now because they're over there with her on on waxy on waxy junior but boy when she was here they hated that bitch like the producers hated her they engineers hated her because on the air she came up with this real sweet sugar coated phony image but in person fact the only person that liked her was a Cheryl was the only person that the good like her and that's because japs of a feather go shopping together so 1122 a wio d there's no reason 16 wio d listen longer and you'll get an attitude to go to the understand that I would jump in front of a bullet for Nicole and How to kill her. Oh, Jay went out to kill her. Oh! That's me. One day, the jury's got a set free O.J. For all we know we've got to head your way, hey. Oh, yeah. And O.J. got to get ya. You heard? It's true. O.J. got to come after you. And that he'll get away with that one too. Oh, yeah. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to know we've got to find some camera to see. O.J. got to let her go. O.J. got to know we've got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. got to get ya. O.J. was like a low but you don't know the camera. I thought you were right. You're a little blind behind a glass. Ooh. Oh, can you talk to me? Are you? Are you sure? Don't take on a catch, or take on a catch, or if you don't get you, hey, you're right. Don't take on a catch, you're right. Okay, I love it. 28 at WOD. We got a little delimium here because I guess Mark Furman, the German, is going to be back on a witness stand that A before he takes off for Northern Idaho. You know, it's really interesting by the time the trial is all over. Arroz al-Opaz will be in El Salvador. Mary and Gurches who will not even testify. She'll have a race in federal prison somewhere. Mark Furman, he'll be in North Idaho with the Area Nation. I mean, and of course, OJ, he's slipped out again. Today's we forgot about him. We're trying to keep track just like when he was in the house that day. Remember that famous day in Vegas? Roll out there on our Vegas trip last year. You know, something it was our trip with Bob Lincoln to Vegas that incited this entire event to take place. It was the inspiration for America for the OJ business was our trip to Vegas. And I'm sitting there in my room and sick as a dog and I turn on the TV and there's this car chase up and down to freeway. And I said, what the hell is that? We're a spigot. There's the freeway. And it just went on and on and back and forth. And the next day we had the thing at Bobby Shapiro's in there and he's making his plea. Oh, OJ, give yourself what's this all about the command of my house. It was a beautiful thing. And here we are months and months and months later and we're still so I don't know what I'm going to do when at them things starts because Flee Bailey's going to be grilling him again. They say that Flee might actually take a little oxygen because his performance yesterday was a little on the stale side. Here's a play that's what Bob Shapiro said. Here's plantation. Hello. Hey, Neil, how are you doing, buddy? Pretty good sir. Hey, I fact you last night because I'm going to be at the Panthers game tonight and usually during the day time, you know, I lay tile and marbling. It's a real hard to call you, but you lay a pipe during the day time, yeah. Yeah, I lay pipe in the daytime also. I believe it. But besides that tonight, I'm combined. Check you out at the game. You know, because I've been wanting to come to the game and see you and I'm a loyal listener. You know, I'm only 23, but I listen to you every day at work and I just think you chose the greatest and he's awake to sit up man. That's right. They need a goddamn animals what they need. They need a blueberry animal. They would know, definitely if that came around for a while because they need something. They need somebody to squeeze their bag tight, hardened fast. There's nothing like tight, hardened fast believe me. You know, and I've become the night and I'm going to come say hello to you with my girlfriend and I'm going to be very rude to you. No, show the floor to what it's all about it to game. All right. All right. So you have a good day and see it tonight. Go Panthers. Go Pan. See you. We have an open line and Broward five two four. Okay. Here's your starting line up on left wing number 29. Your hand, Garpent love. Well, come on. Let's give him a big reading. This is his, uh, it's not his first. He played in one. Did he play in one game the other day? I think he did. In the Ottawa game. That's right. That was his first home game, the Ottawa game. This guy's a player. This number 29 keep your eye on your hand. Baby, Garpent love. He's a sweet who sounds like a Russian. So if you want to find out about his answers three before he decide if you like him or not. See, that's one thing in this town. All the other hockey towns. They got all these the Swedes and the fins and the checks and rooskees and everything and no problem except in Montreal, of course, where they just have the French and English and they hate each other already. But here. Oh, but when we go get some Cuban hockey players, that'll bring out that crowd. Where's Benito, Benito, Benito, Benito, Benito. That's what it's all about here. All those people ever coming out to those Marlon games want to be interesting to see if they could just get a whole bunch of guys with foreign last names. See, there we get started on that again. Well, I just want to see how much it takes to prod these assholes because we've got this gigantic Cuban closet audience and man, they are comatos. They're out there, but they don't want to admit it, especially on this show. Here's Western. Hello. Hello. Yes, man. How you doing today? Okay. I wanted to call you and say it's the first time I seen your commercial. I think it's great. What? That TV spot? It's a little spot. That's from last year. It's leftovers. Yeah, but I mean, I haven't seen it. I don't watch 33 or 39. My kids are watching it. I just popped it on the scene. I thought it was good. Yeah. I wanted to tell you, my kids are into this game, Paul. Give you heard of it, Paul. No, I have not. Okay. It's a game where they're milk caps and you stack them up and you take these real thick, round brass things called slammers. Yeah. Hit them and whatever flips over face up is your to keep. Now, how old are your kids? 45? No. There's six and seven. Oh, I see. Okay. Okay. Now, here's the best part. Send my kid off with $5. He needs a new slamer. So he goes this door and he comes back with this brass lamer. It looks funny. It's all engraved. So I said, let me see that. The slamer, I thought he was on QAM and he afternoon the slamer. No. And that where he's hanging out. Embossed on this thing is OJ in the slamer. All right. Oh, man, do it. I'm going to go home and play that to saffton on. I'm once I had to coin a Tim behind bars and killed the other side of Tim in the high speed Chate in the Bronco. I love it. So my kids are doing the cold. I feel like this is, but I said, that's a good slamer. It's a good slamer. Dude, when you're lost. My favorite don't lose that. It's going to be worth some serious bucks after they gas his ass. I think so. Okay. Have a great day. You too. Bye bye. I'm reckless. I feel like you're really Lewis. Maybe I can marry my niece. I want me to make babies. I'll tell you what I'm going to deal with. You pal at asshole at Card yesterday. When Hank Goldberg gets married and starts making babies, I'll do it on the same day. How do you like that? I'll show you what a real man's all about. It's 1134 at WIOD. It's 10. WIOD was in his good for you as it was for us. I got you down. Oh, deep door. You wearing a show. When she'll hang up the phone. If you're curious, he's all deep door. A real adventure with me. Oh, I haven't had a sex life. Seems that a reason's been my wife. Oh, deep door. Very sexual. For you hang up the phone. If you're curious, he's all deep door. Very sexual with me. I got you down. I love it. Okay, 1138 at WIOD. 22 till noon. About a half an hour, 45 minutes, 50 minutes, 55, maybe an hour. Mark Ferbant takes to stand again. And I'm just kind of debating maybe we should just put it on cold and just leave it on all afternoon. I think I'll be gone. Or maybe not. Here's a facts from somebody. I love the ones where they don't put any name on it, but I'll be at the again. But anyway, what's section you sit in and where will you be? And can I take a look at it and how big is it? P.S. did you hear the good news? This is the best news of ever. All your friends, Canadians who are listening out there get ready. Just like Jackie Gleason would say you're going to the moon, baby. Frogs can reproduce in outer space. So all the frogs are going in outer space. We're putting them in a gigantic time capsule and sending them into space. And guess what? The air is free. Where the hell is that damn thing? Are we never going to find that? That honey motor is staying that Jackie Gleason with the Bobbit? God damn, everything as soon as we find it, they take it away from us again. Let's do Miami. Hello. Hey Neil, this is a young, stupid, nearly in Miami. All right. A miracle out of the closet, baby, and into the streets. By the way, lady, that German lady sounded kind of sexy. I wanted to see a Georgia Tracer phone number to give her a call. Yes, she said she likes cheese. Hey Neil, I wanted to talk about my German testimony yesterday. Yes sir. The reason why he needed to lie a little bit was because it was supposed to be there for a notification. Not for investigation or a demonstration. Because they jumped the fence because after he saw the blood, they thought that there might be a victim inside and they didn't wait for the search warrant. So, it's also interesting that he just went around the corner to look at the other gate. But the spec of blood was on the street side of the Broncos. Yeah, to be in the street. To see that side of the Broncos. But still, they're just lying about procedural investigating a pottenant policy rather than guilt. Yeah, I think, uh, OJ is guilty to begin with. You'll do yourself. But he'll walk. He will walk. So, don't you worry about it. See, everybody. We know he's guilty number one and all the people who want to apologize for him and make an excuses, even though the evidence is overwhelming. I mean, keep it mind. They haven't even come close to getting the blood evidence yet to the DNA and the RNA and the SPCA. They haven't even come close to that. That's that's right. But I have a feeling that that jury is just, if they say that Superman committed the murders and fool out of that. That's why he didn't leave any footprint. They say, you see that's it. That's that's a reason. It was Superman and he's not guilty. So, whatever. I think Clark Kent was there on the night. That's what Mary Ann Gurches said. All right, Neil. Have a great day, amigo. Ooster came to you all of you. Okay, really? We have an open line in date, 7519463. There was a young spick right there, man. There was a good guy right there on the phone who comes out of the closet isn't embarrassed like Jose. Where is Jose? God, if I could find Jose right now, my next 2.5 hours here could be so much more pleasant. And that's why I'll never find him or hear from him again. Let's do another thing at PizzaLoft tonight and invite Jose to come by. We'll screw the hockey game. Here's the North Miami Beach. Hello. On the Purple Line is gone. North Miami Beach on a Purple Line is gone. Well, shame on you, man. Purple Line is open at Poundio D. Let's do Miami. Hello. Hello. Goodbye. Two open lines a day, 751. Are you talking to these people? Are you finding out if they're there and they're gone? And they're here? And they're tomorrow? Okay, whatever you say. Here's a lady in Miami Lake. Hello. A lady in Miami Lake. Hello. Hello, Neil. It would help if this equipment in here worked too, but you got a punch it and punch it and punch it and you can twist it. How you doing? I knew. That's my own caller. I'm going to come to the right. I'm going to enjoy you show. I listen to you every day. I just wanted to verify with you. I believe you don't know me, but I think, you know my son. Yeah. Michael Beach-ello. He was with Midway Airlines. Yeah. He's with Alitania. With Alitania, yes sir. Right. And we're going to Florence next Monday. Well, how come he never gets me any free train trips to Italy? Were you laughing about? If I can tell you how much money I spend with them every year to go across the Italy Well, what's a small fortune? Try them again and see what he can do for me. Yeah, let's get with it, Mike. But we've been to Italy before, but we haven't been in a few years. So we're going to Florence for 10 days. When you go on, we'll leave the next Monday. Oh my God, you'll have to give me a spirey port. Let me know how it is. All right, I sure will. Enjoy your show and happy-billated anniversary. And thanks a pile. All right, thank you. Thank you. And don't need too much to that resente though. It's very heavy. Just took it with a post. OK, thank you. We have two open lines today. 7.5. 1.1 on a purple pound line at pound IOD. All I had to do was mention O.J. and Mark Furman right away. They're starting to nervous because it's getting close to noon. Time. They're starting to rearrange their lives now. And as I was saying to Rick this morning, I keep blaming the women, which we have very few women callers anyway on a whole radio station. So what's the logic in that? They're eight and none. I keep saying, well, it's the women and this O.J thing. If it's only the women, then how come 95% of our callers are male? And they're all disappearing too every day. Like yesterday, it was weak. OK, it was a bad Monday for everybody here. But it was really weak as soon as the goddamn F.L. Bailey started cross-examining Mark Furman. You can just watch the phone and see what these people are doing. So don't lie to me and tell me that you don't care and you're not watching it. You're watching every goddamn second of your whole life's revolve around it. This is another closet pastime in America. It's not just a Greg and Andy up there. We're doing each other up there in a bonaventure or wherever it is that they're in a closet right now. Do any other play little grab ass with a radio cranked up or you're allowed getting sexual excitement from the good vibrations. That's not bad enough. But we have all these closet O.J. watchers. And when you get the small dish by the way, you'll be in heaven. Because it's on court TV. It's on CNN. It's on E. It's on A. It's on I. It's on O. It's on U. It's on like a heaven-ousin different channels constantly. So when CNN goes to commercial, have no fear. Just flip down from 202 to 203. Next channel over there's Cort TV. And you get to see Fred Graham with his white hair at no extra charge. Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. You know, two thoughts. What did you think about that Caia Yocho? First of all, the crowd they were saying was like a million and a half. Well, I wasn't invited so I didn't go there. No, but here's the thing that I thought was most amazing. This is that there was like one girl got cracked on the head with a bottle. Somebody was throwing it. Yeah. And there was like 37 arrests. Which to me is like an incredibly low number considering all the buttwiser. There was a swash in around there. That's right. Well, you deal with some very civilized people. Well, I don't know. That part of the other part. When I get pissed off, they just drop a bomb somewhere. That's all. They don't go around shooting people. Yeah. Well, I'm just saying that that number of people. The hype bomb here in there, like maybe in your mailbox. The other thing is, is that have you any comments on what the state has got with their sentencing guidelines that they've just reduced some of these things? Like pretty incredible. Like if you have one second a person can make a little grand theft with six prior felony convictions, including aggravated assault. Yeah. OK. One year, county jail, maximum. Mm-hmm. What's your thoughts on that? What's my thoughts on it? Yeah. What do you want me to give you my thoughts? And what is there to think? What do you want? What kind of a question is that what am I thought on that? A rape is convicted in three separate arm sexual batteries. Yeah. He gets what? A half an hour in there. Oh, yeah. I mean, the second. Well, they don't want to do endangered the other inmates. Thank you. We have cut it as close to the bone as we possibly can. There you go. There's your governor, man. How about two counts of three drugs for every politician sounds good to me? Well, even a dad. Check that out with Warren Saff. Have a great day, Pally. Thanks. Just locked the door from the inside. We have an open line of brown. He wants me to try to rationalize what's going on out there. I'm not going to do it. It's in the sick. It's sick. I say lock new Kingrich up is what I say. I can free for all time lock up new Kingrich, strum, thermon, Jesse Helms, William Dan and Meyer. And of course, that goddamn Pete Wilson, the governor of California, is turned out to be the biggest racist, fascist, the bigoted, bigoted, bigoted history of mankind. There's a real good one for you, man. They always talk about how liberal and radical California is. See, California is the mix of the far right and the far left and those are all confused in between. And those who don't give a crap because of the two busy, uh, fighting gang wars. But God Almighty, this Pete Wilson, he's moving so far to the right. He's making Pat Buchanan lookay and Jewish. Oh, that'll take away Rick's photo, I guess. It's 1147 a WIOD. Next year, WIOD. South Drunken Stupid is no way to go through life. Okay, it's 1150 a WIOD. So I just discovered something in the DCS here, which was for Christmas that we never played in because we haven't heard guitar man in so long. Just here, those 8 Ems ringing in, driven me by the Yahoo. And it'll kill him in anyway. Come on, it's lovely weather to go back up together with you. Yeah, but wait, yeah, but wait a second. I should up, charge it up, charge it up, y'all hold. Let's jump in the hole. What is it? To the tune of 21st set or so. That's what breaks into Andy. Let's jump in. I should up, charge it up, 20 grams. Now check out my plan. Oh, I'm writing on book and it looks like chapter 13 of Jeff. I love to hit the lottery, but I'm an unlucky old school. So I guess this lovely weather to go back up together with you. You, you, and you. Beautiful. See, it's well done. It's not a good bit, but it's well done. I figured we ought to play it once and then get it out of there. Here is some rise. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. The OJD Finch. They had a purchase, purchase. Is that a good one or a... I guess it's Mike. We have an open line and, you know, this block off the old shipman. Some of you got to come over and just beat the, Bleat you, bleat you, bloody, baby. What an asshole. And your wife, she's also an asshole. How do you like that? I usually don't call women assholes, but in your case, I'll make an exception. I lovely asshole, but nonetheless. And then what they said when Aaron started to hear something about a lovely asshole, I'm not sure what to steal next time. My, my, look at that. Here's a medley. Hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you doing today? From Mendus. First time call her. All right. Don't get a keys to call you much, but, uh, or don't get a... Well, we're changing that man. We're getting these people out of the weed work today, man. Yeah, I don't drive trucks for 11. I'm up and down the road on day. And you don't want to help speak it through. So keep up the good work. Thanks, not pile, pal. All right. How was a day? You, too. Open line and, uh, open line and date 751. By the way, I guess in the noon hour, because we're up against that whole OJ business. We have to have something really inspiring on J.R. We're going to be on the K-T-Stee Public Address and Answered Marklight. Stayed, but also a course for the Marlins at J.R.S. Uh, who spent many, many years doing hurricane sports. J is going to be on with us telling us the real stories, talking about drugs. Of drug deals and drug use. And I mean, over the years with the baseball and football programs, it's going to be a real eye-popper. Don't say popper around J. Here's Bokeh. Hello. Hello. Yes. It's your Italian ice-pies. How you doing today? Uh. Yeah. How you doing? Great. No. Pronic. Me and the roommate were thinking about getting this. What is this me and the roommate? Do we have any guys out there who don't have a male roommate? Well, you know, got to do it. We're thinking about you. You got to do it? We're thinking about getting the DSS out. Do it. Yeah. Do it. It'll keep you busy. You won't be calling us show so much. It'll give you something to do. Yeah. We won't get you to do it. We want to see if we can get my arm at the number. Yeah. And maybe you could hook us up. Maybe he can hook you up. Okay. Hang on. George, I'll give a t-don't do this again. Okay. You're going to be talking. You're going to be at the game tonight? You know what? Damn it. Okay. Hang on. Okay. He's on 80. Italian ice-pies. Man, that part piezano just won't go away no matter what I say. Oh, man. We have an open line in date. 7.519463. 7.51.

You're at the Brower Mall. It was quite a few months ago. You were at the Brower Mall? Right. You had that big Kate there. Who was? Well, you mean it to Macy's Mall. The Fancy's Mall. Yeah.

No, we do. Okay. Have a good day. See ya. Bye. Hope it landed. Brower at 5249-463524. Now George was standing me. As well. Every line on the board is lit up. But it'll be real interesting to see once we get past the new news. And they think that this OJ crap is going to start again. It'll be real interesting to see just how the excitement and activity level keeps up on this guy to show today. And I think he may have a point. You know what? Here's a mobile in Miami. Yes sir. What's up man? How are you doing? Hey, that DSS. You got that? Yeah, I got it. It brings an international channel to just the US. From Uranus. No really.

Okay. Pubbles. What is it? Pubbles. Pubbles. Where is it? Pine Island and Cleary. Right. And Pine Island and Cleary. Okay. I think it's up your alley. I think you like it. What kind of food? I would say continental, but a lot of really interesting things on the menu. You mean like a fancy restaurant? Pubbles were the thing like that. It sounds like, you know, bamboo is next door or something. Yeah. No. No bamboo. It's nice. Have this beer very tastefully done. Pine Island and Cleary. Wait a minute. Pine Island and Cleary. Yeah. And the, uh, And the south east side of the corner. I'll be damned and never saw it. It's kind of hit. You could drive my past it and never see it. Okay. I'll search for it. But it's the restaurant too. Yeah. It's not too far. Okay. Hi. Thanks. Okay. He's got their radio cranked up in a hurry, man. That's probably uh, owns the place. We have an open line in Broward. 5249463. 5249464. We have one on the green line, man. We're not sustaining this tremendous, uh, Momentum. I can just feel it. I'm telling you when the new news comes. How is our thing doing? See, you're getting a premature in your evaluation. Now they're not even batting that thing back in 4th on AP audio. So just relax when Mark Furman gets on it when he puts on his hip boots today in his swastika and tilts his arm up in here. I'll be the first one to let you know. And we get that bitch from Germany to call us back. That call before. That started all his trouble. Whatever it is. Here's Boeton Beach. Hello. Hello, Dan. Yes, sir? Hi, I was listening to your show today and it's great. I did. I did agree with you more about the on Sanders and Warren's happened. Most of the things that you say. Monotese guys cut this crap up into the worst rule models and they make Pablo people are laughing at him. They're laughing at him. And I don't care if they're laughing all the way to the bank. These guys are crap. They're crap on legs. Well, they glamorize him on TV and they can't really. Exactly. That's right. Just like they're glamorizing his demo, J-thing. Everything that's sick and twisted and disgusting. They glamorize and then everybody wants to be just like them. Well, it comes down to this. If anyone's not getting a fair trial, it's the state because these lawyers keep pulling more and more crap over on people. And he's probably going to wall, which he's really sad. Yeah. I overheard. Well, I was just sure if you have 10 million bucks, you can go out and kill a few people too. Get away with it. Well, I wasn't holding notice. You're mentioning people. Yeah. What's specifically don't you like about it? The fact that he's breathing, that that's for a good start. He is the most bigoted, the most racist, the most homophobic, the most right-wing the most the biggest piece of turd I have ever seen in my life. He makes Ed Davis who at least the saw got Ed Davis at least came around a little bit. He got Barry Goldwater syndrome. He means one proposition when he said that. Every thing that he comes down with man is it comes from a bigot. All he does is appeal to bigotry. He's perfect for the Republican party in the 90s man. He's just a full fledged card carrying bigot. Do you disagree with proposition when he said that? Yes, I do. Oh, why? In other words, these kids shouldn't get education. What are they going to do? They don't belong in the country. They know something. I don't agree with our whole immigration policy, but that's a federal thing. The state hasn't got to write to just say, well, we're just screw these people. And we're just going to ignore them and then they're going to go out. We can have like 500 more gangs all over California. That's the way to solve the problem. They should corner by over the fence. That's what they should do. They don't belong just like in Florida. We have the same exact problem. Cardinal of the fence. Our tax dollars are paying for illegal immigrants to get free hospital care and Haitian so forth, which most working people can't afford themselves. Something wrong with that. Yeah. And see, disagree with that. disagree with what? I just got to say in the immigration policy sucks. It's a joke. And what are you going to do? Make up your own immigration policy now? I would go to the news right now. So we fire people. So what? News talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. Miami Fort Lauderdale. WIOD. Miami. This is your secret.

doing baby the game is on game on there we go okay won't be long now but this long here's watch tester hello hello yes sir hey near you doing good listen I mentioned I heard I mentioned something about your dog getting out from underneath the fence this morning yeah no exactly what you're talking about I got to call last night about three thirty in the morning I got to go back to my dad in my house and tell me my dog is out in the middle of sunset of course I live right on sunset dry nice yeah exactly I thought I got to middle of sunset right in rush hour be a good idea well you know my first mistake was going to chase after the dog here I am at three thirty in the morning no sure about thirty pounds overweight yeah couldn't find my shoes chasing after the full dog I couldn't find so I decided to go back and get my bicycle look around for well I thought I couldn't find a dog for about an hour I decided to return home pulling my bike into the gate what do I find stupid little dog is in the back inside the gate oh yeah they always do that that's my dog does if you just ignore if you chase him he just keeps going if you just ignore him and threaten the pain of attention he comes running back he just leave the door open he runs back in house well you know I can know the neighbors once a dog gets about two or three blocks away I get nervous when I see him coming back in the direction of the house I get very nervous yeah well I figured the brain or so small that once he gets two two blocks away probably wouldn't find his way back no chance but if it wasn't for the kid I tell you I would let that dog run in the damn street but I'll play have a good time if he lives great and if not you pack him a sandwich right exactly I got three more I know the thing well you know the people that put your fences in when I bought my house and I spent a lot of money to put a big beautiful wooden fence in there they did generally speak in a pretty good job however they really and I you know you tell them I have you they can see you got two dogs once a big one which you don't have to worry about once a very tiny little dog that weighs about ten pounds you have to make sure that every one of those slats is down into the ground not not several inches above the ground not an inch above the ground but down flush like right into the ground so the dog can't dig his away and I'm going to tell you every few months he finds another spot I take bolder I take rocks I take every damn thing that's ever been invented and then a few months later he finds another guy damn spot with it a crappy job sure well I do that you know I went and I bought my bags of sand and I put them all along the fence and then the association now that the association decides they're going to dig a pipeline right behind my fence yeah four foot trench when they sit back in they must have left ten new new gaps of holes with this dog can get out beautiful like you said every time I still want in the dog itself from another damn hole yeah so what I want to do now tonight I get I like the damn small dogs and so small I have to lock them up in the cat box in the cat box and I tell you a little about half hour in a microwave is always a good idea not with it turned on necessarily but just this kind of a warning I don't think he'll do it again yeah well you know I kind of got to improve in the damn dog if I leave him out of the dozen get out he barks all freaking night yeah okay well good luck to your pal okay back to you we have an open line in date seven five one one and browner five two four all our friends with their little doggy stories like me it's one of those things you know it's one of the one of the problems of having a little dog if you have a big dog then everybody looks at it and they're proud if you have a little dog people laugh at it here's a bokeh hello hi Neil yes yeah I was thinking about I just we just said about Pete Wilson and Mark Furman how the racist right I don't know that Mark Furman's racist that's alleged Pete Furman and Pete Furman I know I mean Pete Wilson well what a Freudian slip that was Pete Wilson is a racist that a bigot and he appeals to all the worst these kind of like a rommel the Reagan with the memory well it appears to me that you're racist because you call these you know the specs the day goes and all that right I'm a racist because we're using that to make a point zero you two stupid to understand that you just a court sucker yeah you're just a court whole man you're court liquor we have an open line and I you know that is by the way that's your buddy again you know just because we brought you guys out of the closet I guarantee that Greg and Andy are doing each other right now well it's almost wednesday tomorrow is hump day let's go to a Miami hello yes sir I'm an immigration attorney here in town I just want to say I think all these people are caught off your immigration attorney yes yeah I think all these people want to cut off the legal aliens for benefits or more on yeah simply because I don't understand what they want to do but because they would put you on that would put you out of business is that why I think one defend like real americans and do something for people are like like O.J. go out there and make some serious money I think these people are a racist they're saying that they would put me in their outrageous what's wrong with taking care of your own people first we can't take care everybody in a guy named world who's desperate should we bring in all the people here from Ethiopian for Bosnia Herzegovina and everywhere in a guy named world where they're starving and killing each other people think of the cost of labor going up in this town what if we let's keep going cheap labor let's keep bringing in illegal aliens so lawyers like you shysters can keep making my defending them and they can keep taking American people's jobs and we keep exploiting people it's labor get out of here you'll creep just what we need is another god damn lawyer what was that about a 12 year old lawyer he's a lawyer like I'm a damn brain surgeon go back to New York use line ball faster we have an open line in day 75 line why don't you green line 1 80944 how though J do it oh game off game off can't be long now man can't be too far so just stay too well we'll give you a good look at this a good dose here's a lot of day a lake solo yeah you know I just happened to be listening to your show and then I had to get out of my car but while I was listening on uh... hold here i happened to think that there's a what's called an electric fence that you could get for a small dog like that because they do have a tendency to tunnel out and it's like that they put a special color on the dog and then a little walk very low voltage wire that they pay high rated wire he had you don't like your dog I guess I would work anyway um... the reason why I call was to the well one thing that I wanted to tell you another thing they're trying to make I think uh... don't you uh... national celebrity hit the uh... really both fight Saturday night they were showing jack nickel and number of other uh... actors celebrities and then they also show don't you we need some help so you know everybody got a big thrill on the scene don't you are but the the reason why always and the chill up my spine exactly but it only depends on what direction it should go in uh... but the reason why i call is just as I got out of the car you're talking about California and somebody told me once the California is like a granola for a fake out of the fruits and that's all you have to say that's older than that's older than my great great grandmother well maybe we've got to get to get to the right i don't know i've been to California it doesn't impress me anymore the south for the uh... oh now you're dreaming there you're dreaming California at least got to take it i agree with you i absolutely not well for you i'm not talking about living there but just in terms of the people they're at least in California got a few men in people that got an IQ bigger than their jocs eyes for a man is just a bunch of uh... retard and uh... rubber afters and uh... mister about like maybe 15 percent of the people in florida got like some intelligence and the rest of the people are more on the preview at you to the point this this is the state of the city this is a thousand years behind the be a behind the stone age maybe that's why i get along the well with people up north yeah or maybe that's why you're fit in so well here we have an open line in day seven five one one and bowered five two four one on the green line one eight hundred nine see their drop it off now like flies we have sustained a tremendous a

three uh whatever it is you know it's break time it's the time to say goodbye right right okay like yesterday after he asks him how come you were asking the kiddo for the keys to the bronco we said i never asked him for the keys okay so that time you're on our let's go home and let the jury think about that about that lie speaking of having a good memory let's test now first of all remember how how they lied he up when they come in and they buy a station and they say oh we're not going to change anything your job is safe what was the guy's name don't tell me i'll give me a clue who was doing the morning show on hot 105 and he uh when they came in when this company bought hot 105 they said have no fear you're safe with us we love your show and listen and he did this he left the young man running up and down courts are love young men wearing really tight molly what a man remember when they jump what a heard how bad this was all gentlemen. nice and man hey it's time again for some baby can't wait to watch a whole play can't be a they're thinking that's all what you play oh oh okay so to make a long story short they lied that they and everybody in the building knew they were lying they hated them like boys and they blew his ass out of here then they gave Rodney the morning show was doing real great they lied to him and they said hey you're doing a great job Rodney and they they kicked his ass into like doing some flunky thing and brought in time the fly jock joiner the worst shows in the history of the human race that is the most embarrassing show I'm embarrassed for the people who listen to the time to enter show if there are any the worst so mollo he's gone and why the hell did I play that other than the kill like two minutes that was a good idea here's a mobile in Miami hello yes sir I just like more than you bitch in the morning about an open line so I decided to do some about it we have an open line on the green line anyway listen you know I'm an attorney and I stop practicing probably two years ago practice makes perfect that's right because there's nothing I hate worse than the field of law in this tab and boy did that guy sound like a jerk yeah he's another i recursed man he's another guy who's making a living forcing, forcing illegal aliens out of this country and creating hardships for the american citizen absolutely and all this money is going to pay them and now they're yelling and screaming you have to get citizens now they're running to get citizenship status and complaining saying well we've been residents for 10 20 years and we paid our taxes why do we have to become citizens you know as far as i'm a curseman is concerned i thought we just went through that whole business we even sent dot ring Jimmy Carter over there to Haiti and then we got the goofball back into par well how come everybody's not going back it's like all this crap about fiddle if he leaves there tomorrow do you really believe that most of the Cubans are living here right now are going back no way Jose maybe no way i have a great day palmy too congratulations on getting out we have an open line in date and by the way congratulations to Greg and uh and

absolutely right we thought you were just blowing smoke again as usual and you turned out to be right again just like with a baseball crap for years i was telling you i'm going to kill a ghost i laid the golden number man they're killing it and i also said that uh uh if they barely is a dot ring old fart as 1993 189 police reports were turned over as to that incident there are no notes or other materials to turn over all the jury see that now this is all four play again good thing that CNN at least gives you a little uh something on there it says issues are being discussed without the jury in the courtroom so when the jury gets in there well we stick uh firm in the uh German back on a stand then we'll start getting into this but in the meantime i'm not going to waste you with that that

George no my they said it's a car with his combination of his classics well that's not a car that's something i have to put together here which requires about ten seconds worth of effort i'm learning

the link i mean you can't want to do that but look at that but i'm not going to look so big on the technical allegations that they've brought out the challenge uh... and others uh... of her ilk her dad it will be denied because it is indeed false and they know that and they should that means a reason why you don't know when you come right down to it this defense with all the money he's spending they're doing a one crappy as job and they were saying yesterday which is absolutely correct sir and man and anybody else that when she does her closing statement of the jury in about fifty five months if we ever live that long that she's got uh... they might even show the video tape of his opening statement we're joining his coquence says oh yeah well is this arousal opa is and she saw this and she was walking her dog and she saw the time and then there's this very interesting woman Mary and gurches and of course the fact is that they never got to hear or see either one of them because they both turned out to be dead beats in the full of crap and i'm sure she'll lay that on in very heavy duty term that's the defense band that they're a no defense the alibi is he was taken a nap all he wasn't there that he was batten some balls around rung goldman's he was batten some balls around right he's our theoretic he can barely stand up he could never kill anybody but he was practicing his golf swing i mean this is the most peepore i can't take pit four if the what the uh... pith poor defense i've seen it seriously they're making these up the prosecution look good and he's there a bunch of bumbling uh... dumb forks these guys they're pathetic this is a sherry Lewis with a big snazzyer man she couldn't she couldn't uh... do a a trouser in your pants this bitch i know you want to take the break and you're getting very anxious about it but i'm trying to stall and time this thing out between the time we hear Rick weaver and flee baili and have ever seen together by the way twelve fifty a w i o d at six ten w i o d we treat the news stories of the day with all the respect they usually deserve the tami any stranger he's no pretty boy good afternoon at three o'clock on

single what do you think now 125 at wild too there is still honking a tr그 about the scope of the uh... he across examination of a vote and all that stuff. Here's a mobile and key largo, hello. And, yeah. Yes, sir. Hey, I came down to the keys so I could hear Ron and Ron because it's not open for a lot of them. Yeah, they're running a keys. The down and then, they come out and key wet. And you went all the way down there to your run and a con. I have my yacht down here too. Oh, well, that's a better reason I would think, yeah. Yeah, I had to put them all around. I was out there in eight to ten foot waves just today. Or day before yesterday. Trying to catch some fish. Did all right. Good. And for the swim. What? I've said, have a great day. We have an open line in Broward, 5249463. There's a rocket scientist who drove all the way down there to Key West. We'll get out of his yacht and hear Ron and Ron. All right. Here's a bointon. Hello. A meal. Yes, sir. I got something you might want to use there. But it would be better if I could hear it though. You sound like you're on Uranus. No, I'm not there. But you were looking for something for that Nazi bitch to use. And I think I got away for you. Get around it. You can do the know all your cops. Me or not, bitch. You say something like, uh, what a country. Yeah, that's got a pot of George just looked at his head up for the first time in about an hour and a half. So that's, uh, that got in the tension. All right. Not bad. All right. I talked to you later. Take care. See, yeah. Okay. Hang on to what type. Or his OJ would say, this is mine. Oh, I'm sorry. And then what he said, this is mine. Something like that. He said, this is where, uh, F. Lee Bailey comes from. And this is mine. And it was something about his checkbook. I think he was squeezing a real tight. And F. Lee was getting pissed off. Because he ain't getting paid for this anyway, F. Lee. And Bob Shapiro wants to make sure that everybody knows that the token Goy on the crew there, the token white Goy, uh, he ain't getting paid for this. And quite frankly, his performance speaks for itself. Here's Hialia. Hello. Yes, sir. First time calling. All right. Hey, listen. I was at TCI cable in Hollywood. Yes. Oh, bunch of people there, bitching about the price, the quality. Yeah. About 10 feet away. They got little flyers for the new little dish, $39. Oh, that's for that prime star crab. Is this? Yeah. $39? Yeah. What, yeah, but you don't own it. See, this is the deal that the cable companies are involved in this prime star thing. Mm-hmm. Is that available now? Um, I guess so. Are they peddling it? Yeah. God, I sure like to see one of those flyers if you get a hold of one for me. Oh, sure. Uh, you're wearing, um. But you just mail it to me. All right. W-I-O-D-M-E-3-3-1-4-1. Because that, see, this is a deal where they loan you. It's like a microwave, um, micro, like a micro relay thing, or they microwave you. Why do I keep saying microwave? Well, that's correct, but it just sounds like my dog and he often is correct. They microwave you the signal. And, uh, you don't own the equipment. In other words, they just put it in there. It's a three and a half-o-dish. And the problem is that most people who can't have like a big dish is six or seven-foot-dish. They're not also going to be able to have a three and a half-o-dish. So what's the big deal? See, the DSS, the direct TV thing, that's an 18-inch dish. There's nobody even sees, you know. Right. But I'd like to see the thing. Oh, send it to you. So send me your thing. All right. Okay. Thanks. Later. We have an open line of date, 751-1 in the green line. Yeah, these cable companies, they saw the head writing on a wall. They knew that the parties over, baby. No more crappy pictures. People are not going to continue paying for crappy service for snow for all kinds of garbage. And for all kinds of outage to downtime when, you know, they can have alternatives. So they got together these cable, these grave robbers, TCI and Cox and all these other assholes. And they started this prime star bit. But I haven't seen any tangible evidence that anybody has got it here yet. Have they? This is probably like the DSS to the same thing. Remember how long that was? Oh, my God. We had all those verbal brawls on a year about it. It's coming. It's coming. It's not coming. I thought we were listening to them. Passion phones. I think we're not. You know, and finally it got here and it turned out to be one of the greatest things in history. Now, when I got my, I'm going to say it again. I don't care what they have. He doesn't give me no. He didn't give me like a, you know, a $5 discount this guy. He's the cheapest era by the way, Matt. I got him like 85,000 jobs. He coming, you know, it gives me a $2 discount. But nonetheless, he does do great work. But if you get a standard brands or brands smarter, there's a gin in places. Everybody in their brother is peddling these and installing them now. And you really ought to check it out. Instead of just calling me and belly aching or calling up the cable company, my pictures out again, you guys suck and having to put up with a kind of, with a food channel while they're the crap they give you and take it away. Your sports channel all the other. And by the way, all the regional, not the sports channel yet, but that'll be in a matter of time. The regional channels like past from Detroit and KBL and a whole bunch of other ones. The ones from the West Coast, the, they had a King's leafs came on last night. Whatever, and all I want is they have like seven of those on there on your sports package. When you have your small dish. So if it's moving, if you just want the basic thing, if you don't want any of that stuff for like 30 bucks a month, you'll pay less than your payin' for cable now, get a beautiful picture and say screw all you cable people. Better than he left for shock therapy. News talking entertainment radio. Okay. 610 WIOD. Miami Fort Lauderdale. Thank we have cut it as close to the bone as we possibly can. News talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD presents The Neal Rogers Show. To talk with Neal, call 751 WIOD in date. 524 WIOD in Broward. Outside the 305 area code, it's toll free. 1-800-944-WIOD. And say the one customers can call pound IOD at no charge. You perche. The Neal Rogers Show. A news talking entertainment radio. 610 WIOD. But heads. It's the one to two hours. Hey man. What's the 70s out that fear here is? Can you travel around town? Don't you know man? So days were instead fake. We all live through water. Take now harder. For the main president to be fapa. Found a fairies image. Paul E. S. Brown. Was on air between as we saw in real long as life. It makes me wonder just why are they back? I can't believe the stories they had come back. I am so lonely. The fear was the joke. Every all had to watch this boat. J.J. The night is over. The night is over. The night is over. The night is over. The night is over. The night is over. J.J. The screaming hand. I know my heart. The two lips. Cruppity wasn't that right. Telling you, let me. To speak around me tonight. But those two days are here. All right. And now I understand why they are back. I'm gonna feel good though. All day or bad I'm a foot my stairs still though. I'm going to wait at WIOD all the rocket scientists all the time baby and of course OJ. No coincidence by the way that it all happened around the same time. Because Kathleen Bell, Andrea Terry, Phil Coleman and Max Cordoba all worked in the same area and knew each other. And so it's not a real surprise that they've all cooked up. The door is no but. Not at all. And what you will be ready to testify to your career. Trust me your honor is going to be very different from what's been offered today. At some point this gets cumulative and it gets ridiculous. We have Andrea Terry statement that isn't even proven it because it does not go to the issue that allowed that will report compelled the court to see that's what the strategy of what happened to his Bell statement is. The will missing that prohibited value. Philip Coleman has the thing that he said. What is a probative of my aunt. The arms to offer which is under 352. No probative value whatsoever. And she got some big. He's a big. Yes, sir. That's the probative. Everybody. Which it will not be to watch the call of my aunt. And with respect to the statement by a alleged by Max Cordoba, we have zero reliability to that. We have no statement. We have no notes. We have no tape. And we barely missed her hot shot. Mr. Multimedia and Mr. the most famous one in the world. He says, oh, well, I don't have any notes on that conversation because I don't ever take any notes. There is a man. There's your typical lawyer, man. And he says, as Marine, I'll get him up there and understand. And I'll tell the truth and he'll tell the truth and the audio. Yeah, yeah. Okay. Here's a bonaventure. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. What is that thing on our lip? It's a chanker. That's a churpee. I want to talk to you about the week ago, Senator Pompano. I don't know if you already talked about it, but the big wreck at the finish line. No, I wasn't there. Did you see that? No, I was not there taking a few days off. A big wreck in a, I think I believe it was, uh, Auburn. Yeah. Fliped over the top of the horse, landed on the track, turned around and jumped right on the horse that's head. Probably saved its life. Oh, yeah. Fabric was telling me about that. Yeah, I was quite a car call in the Great Horseman man. He's the best out there. Make no mistake about it. We love Mark Ovid. He's defined as horsemen. The finest gentleman. A great driver. Mark Ovid is a credit to our sport. Well, the car to move in the ambulance comes back and wins the next race. I know that's what I heard. Never fathom, uh, never bothered him once. Incredibly. Listen, my big problem is with the Panthers though. Yes. I sit. I got to see them. Don't forget Buffalo tonight. Buffalo to Panthers be there. 70. 70. We got 1500 tickets still on sold. I got to see them take a straight next to the press. Row up, up or deck. Yeah. And on either side of the press row, they blocked off one half of the aisle. You can only use one side because they don't want you walking next to the people who didn't pay to get into the game. I don't know. They got three, uh, you know, arenas. They don't want you up there. They don't want you close to the broadcast thing there because they don't want you saying, uh, Denise Pac-Fan blows stuff like that. Well, they can't be an advocate everywhere. I know. It's the media guys and the players from the opposite team that are scratched. Well, I got news for you, man. It's the fans who pay their harder and money for those tickets. They're the ones that pay their damn salaries. Not these media free loaders that you're talking about. That's right. We can't use the aisle where we sit because they got to black tough. They got three people sent it. Oh, you got to walk on this side because you don't, you don't want to get next to the media. That's a pile of crap. That's a little bit correct. So, uh, you know, anything you can do to it. I'm going to talk to that rumor tonight. I'm going to see him before that game. And I'm going to tell him to get this straightened out or else. All right. And hopefully we can get a win at home here. Okay. We need a bad man. Let's play some offense tonight. Let's go out there and stick it in the net. See ya. Okay. And by the way, those of you who are like Blade Runner girl, of course. I guess this is Buffalo's first appearance here this year. I do believe. Am I right? Am I wrong? I think so. And you want to check out number 17 Craig Simpson of the Buffalo Sabers at number 89 Alexander Mold Gilly. There's a couple of guys that she'd probably like to do two or three rounds with. Blade Runner girl and Janet, who are busy right now probably outside the arena. So, if it around. Oh, I can smell it. These guys are circumcised. Tony, don't get too nervous. You won't smell the cheese that far out. Are they circumcised or not? 12 minutes after one at WIOD. Let's. Are they circumcised or not? 610 WIOD. Creed offensive or obscene. The staff and management of QAM apologize for their transgression. But if I am guilty of anything, it is of giving all that I have to have. All that I have to give, if my penis, my buttocks, my lower torso, thighs, and any other error that they want it to help children all over the world. One fatale Sharon Stone is doing a Western, meaning really doing a Western. A fist full of booze. You're a bird. You're not. You're naked. You're not. You're a bird. When you're in a showdown with Sharon Stone, you know you're going down with your boots up. Hey, there, this is curry 45. We'll. We're not that big. They were now right, Perkins. But she's a cool hand with a gun. We'll really know her smith and weapon. Are you Mr. Smith? Yep. Well, I brought the Western. Yeah. Ah, ah, ah. We're going to be resting on her. A fist full of booze. Starring Sharon Stone. It'll give new meaning to the turn. Calgary. Okay. I just so I have to be really good up from his chair, which is quite an accomplishment. I'm reading their own screaming on the other side, just particularly in full wrath. Was that me? I mean, isn't that clear? When we write draft, we write incomplete. We write first version. Same thing. It means there's a second version. There's more. Or at least there are additional notes. Yeah, let's put Mr. McKin on the witness stand. I want to munder oath. That sounds good. No, we're not going to do that. This choir at least not at this point. The thing is, I've given you the opportunity to review the statement. I will not allow crosses the emanation, as to Mr. Martin statements. And lessen until you've had the opportunity review this. I'll give you the opportunity to talk to Mr. McKinna to see if there are any other notes. And my recollection is that this is listed in the discovery index. And with regards to available, you know, it's another thing. So we can take that up later. I don't really, we've kept the jury waiting. Yeah, let's give John to my bipolar family to be. Since I'm recruiting cross-examination on that issue. Anyway, at this point, why don't we, we should work with what we've had. Move along, your little jab. Okay, let's go to a Jupiter. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I like this straight now. I'm the continental, the guy that went into continental. They started a little flyers. It was TCI. So, all these, same difference. All these, all, they keep the TV booking there. And they have a flyer from national habitat. It's $39 a month for the... Try the disc. Trimster. That's all. It's not the prime star. It's the DSS. It's not a... Oh, I see 39 bucks a month. That is the DSS, right. And, well, why do they have that in there? They just keep the TV booking there because it's, um, stabilized. Well, I see. So, in other words, they, they probably don't even know that's in there. So, they don't have to print TV books for themselves. They just use some Sentinel TV books. Got it. And one more question about that. Do you, uh, user talking about a hockey game on the, uh, this last night? Right. All for them. Aren't they, uh, isn't that in the package? You got a, that's separate to the sports. Yeah. But I think it was only 69 bucks for the, uh, you know, for the short and season. But, uh, they don't have every game on, but they have, like, over 200 games on. Oh, I understand. And the picture is incredible, man. And I like I said last night, the air, there were four games played. They had every one of them on. And the channels are right next to each other soon. Flip back and forth and up and down in and out. No, I understand that. But you were saying on that sports channel package. They, they black out those games just for your information. What do you mean they black out what you, you know, those read it on sports channels? No, they don't. Yeah, the, yeah, the professional games are black and out in our area. In what area? And, unless you're in that local area, they black those games. Oh, they don't. I got the dish, Neil. You got the small dish. Yeah. I watched him. One of those games last night. I don't know what you're talking about. They're having been any games blacked out on that thing since I've had the dish. Well, uh, you might have eaten some of the zip code or something. No, I didn't ask. Look, Neil, I don't have to. You're getting me mad here. I'm getting you mad. You're full of crap, man. Get out of here. What a liar. He must work for the cable company. I'm getting the mad because I'm telling the truth. There were no blackouts. There was a prime network from Los Angeles. Had the kings and the lease on its 730. Sunshine had the Tampa Bay game that got the zip by Jim Carrey and the capital's last night, three nothing. That was on there from Sunshine. They had the, um, the penguins in Montreal game from KBO with Mike Lang. That was on there. And the fourth game was the blackhawks and the stars from the Dallas HSC from their network. And there was none of them blacked out. And I don't give many fakes. They've got a zip code right there. Why do people want to lie to you? Unless of course they forgot something to do with a cable company. That guy pitted me off out here that right now. I'm pissed off. Here's sunrise on a purple line. Hello. There you go. Yes, sir. How do you? Pretty good. I was trying to get a hold of you a couple of weeks ago. What was the problem with our Ronnie's helmet? Metamires. He's always losing his helmet. What's his name? Robbie? Metamire. Metamire? Well, I'm Cuban. I see. Yeah. Yeah. Did you notice that? Robbie jettimire. He said a couple of rose down from me. He likes to keep it loose. Yeah. And I held that too. Actually, he's getting a little brave fighting. He's starting to butcher a little bit. He's playing a little bit better. Once he fills out into his body and grows up a little bit and bushes up, he'll be alright. He's coming around. We got like, you know, I still say, two Barnes man is great. Two Barnes to me is God on the skates. Let me tell you. And his carpet is good in the Gordon Murphy and Jodie Hall and him. I predicted that the two was going to score the winning goal the other night. Yeah. One. One we're playing the centers. Yeah. I knew that he was going to come through with us. Alright. You know, one more thing, Neil. Yes sir. You played, you haven't played this one in a long time. Jack in the box. Jack in the box. Yeah, yeah. But we'll play it again just about you. Just to make you happy. Okay. Just calm down and get a grip. Okay. Okay. Okay. Socket easy. That's what the Puerto Ricans always say. Socket easy, man. Well, it's not always easy. Sometimes. It is so hard. Anyway, so how the, oh, here's Mark Furman just said down. Says is a racist to try to frame Simpson for the murders of Goldman and ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson. He is. Okay. So anyway, we'll do our break. We'll come back to you a little Mark Furman. We'll check Jack in the box. We'll check one of these 85 million calls. We'll do the whole deal here. The got someishpocha, 120 to it. W mild. 16 W I O D. People talk how people feel. Big, that party. It is very hard. Hey, how the hell are you? Well, can the Jack and the box? I'm Jack. Can I be happy to fill your order if you know what I mean? Uh, I'd like a Jack burger and a large fries. Sorry, pal. We're cleaning the grease fryer. We don't have any French fries today. Okay. Uh, that just give me a smaller to a fries, please. I'll have a chief. Maybe you didn't hear me. I said we don't have any f*** fries today. So how about something else? Okay. Then just give me an order of fries. Listen up, pal. Who put the straw and straw berry? Did you do that, right? Nature did. Who put the ape and ape, bro? Nature does, right? Nature did. Now listen carefully. Who put the freak in French fries? Uh, there ain't no freak in French fries. That's what I've been trying to tell you. But breath, there ain't no freak in French fries. Now get out of my sight before I shut your teeth so far down. You f*** through. You'll have to sit on a Jack burger to eat it. Oh, I'm gonna have a nice day. And back to you, 1207 at WID. We have a call allegedly from Atlanta. Hello. Yeah, how are you doing? Okay. Yeah, stop the Atlanta. Is that you up here? You're what? It's a nice day up here. Yeah. Believe it or not. I believe you. Yeah, but the compared to listening to the O.J. trial and your sister station up here in Atlanta. No, I'd do that. I'd say it looks like it could be similar to the one on Bundy. Yeah. I don't get enough of it to be honest with you. Don't have a life. In other words, they're just playing the trial. What are they doing with it? They're just putting it on. Yeah, but I mean, who are they going to end the ruts? I mean, Neil Bork. So, some other right wing, Tommy, that's on the stations up here? Yeah. So, I don't know what to worry. It's a pretty bad station. I'll tell you that for 50,000 watts in one of the major markets in the country. WSB is an embarrassment to the industry. Yeah. And it's the fact that the station of our chain. The newsbreak or something like that are half way decent. The traffic, I guess, is that... The traffic, I guess. The traffic, notless. We got crappy traffic. They got good traffic. Other than that, forget it. Yeah. But, you know, I'd rather have some sunshine down there to be at the hospital. There you go. What a cool breeze. Okay. How's the Panthers been doing on the 10th of June? Panthers want to read a role that the tenants pretty good were sell out most of the games or close to what? And I think, we'll see. We'll see. We've got three big games. We've got Buffaloed Night Islanders on Thursday. And I mean, the caps on Thursday and who the hell is it on Saturday? The Flyers. Flyers. That's great. You haven't checked on their tent. It's a little bit. Yeah, we're doing okay. We're getting there. And one of these days, we might play a real game too. He'll scared a hell out of you. It's Panthers on 10th of June tonight. No, he's not. Okay. They said he might skate on Thursday. We don't. We got enough problems. We don't need him. We got enough problems dealing with the guilty in those guys. He was down there in what farm a couple weeks ago. Yeah. My brother ran into him with the mom. We don't permission him. And to be first, perfect on us with you. He circumcised. Is he really? Yeah. Okay. Well, you know, he's proud. Is he traveling with a team or not? He has the travel. He was down there doing some rehab work. Some other words, if he was already down here, he's probably here right now. I just want to Blade Runner girl and Janet her friend who are two real jocks. They're first to know that Pat's down here and he is circumcised. Yeah. So he's got plenty of brother. He's got time on his hands. Okay, probably. He's even better looking. Hang in there. Thank you. Have a great life. Okay. Call for Atlanta. There's a real. Let's go to show you. WSB our sister station up there is so boring that they're calling me from Atlanta. Just have a little verbal intercourse because he's tired of hearing his grandson. Same time it would have been even worse. It would? Yes. Wouldn't you think the first four trips would be enough to blood out any footprints of a perpetrator if any the were? I didn't see any evidence of any footprints. Well, you wouldn't see footprints and leaves. Would you detect if you know that takes an expert. Don't you? I don't believe you. Is this thing? Do you have some training about what criminalists do? Yes, sir. Did your terrorist yesterday you had taken a course. We're in footprints of various kinds. We're discussed. There was not a specific course but yes, it was mentioned. I said, you took a course where in footprints. He's getting a test. Is that true? Testing. Not just footprints. That was part of a, I didn't say just footprints. Here's a lady in North Miami Beach. Hello. It's about time. You know, I've been just February one trying to get you. You've been holding on since February the first. I've no longer hold a runner. I must begin to black and blue by now. Yeah. Listen, sweetie pie. Yes, man. I've been holding on to the field. There's a picture of a court rule and everything in the court. We're in a course of the judge and he's speaking. Listen what he says. The jury is instructed to ignore common sense. Logic, justice and the big picture. And consider only the minor and technical loop holes presented to you by these people who are paid to conceal the truth. Oh, is that good? That's beautiful. I thought you were appreciated. Honey, now you can't say that you don't get caught since February. Once, sweetie pie. Who of what year? Of this year. Oh, this year. That's not so bad. It's only March 14. I'm going to be Rochesterian doll. Okay. Okay, sweetheart. See you at the swigles. All right, dear. Bye-bye. Wherever that is. See you at the Raghu plant. We have an open line in date. 7.5. We got one in Broward. 5.2.49. 463. See you at Hickey Freeman. I think they're out of business. Here's Miami. Hello. Miami. Yes, sir. How you doing? Good. You know this is? No. You let pasomahe go over. You know, you put both arms. All right. Frenchy. Yes, me, I came back this weekend from my brother's wedding. You let pasomahe and go over. You know, you put both arms. That's him. Yeah, I'm going back. It's a superstar. Excuse me? I say you are a superstar now. Oh, thanks for you. You are. I'm going back tomorrow. To where? To Haiti. You're going to Haiti? You remember I told that coach I was... You said that before, but I couldn't believe it then. And I can't believe it now. Why are you going there for what? For work business. This is money to be made down there. Bob, I was sure that we're going to sew some baseballs or something or what? No, no, no. There's real business. Like what? What do you do down there? Drugs? No, not only that. There's a lot of things. Yeah. There's a ship wrecking yard. There's a lot of stuff, man. Big businesses. Any of those two make-ins down there with a good weed? Excuse me? I said it probably having a good time down there. Now that they got the baby and pop a dot out of there. Yeah. And then we get the... Oh, I got no comment on that. Well, I'm a little slow, you know. I've got no comment on that. That I received, man. He never met a freight train. He didn't steal or something like that. Or something like that. Or something like that. Right. Well, let's invest a lot to your pal. We'll keep your memory alive here forever. You'll always be a star. Thanks a lot, Neil. Okay, pal. Good luck. How do you like that? That Porsche lepers going off to Haiti to make some big bucks. I said that this block I'm back and buy us all out. Could have been used in those slags. What are you saying? You let five to the money. You don't break. What about? Could have, yes. Did you decide? See, and then is in prior verdict. As a detective, to try to resolve the issue, as to what it was, and how it got there. At that point, I was just looking for a person that left it. Okay. Now, let's talk about the person that left it. Yeah. I'm sure. But as you stood there, looking at an instrumentality of a broodal murder, who seen you had just visited it, a short time before a kill. And then called again to think about the nature of the person that might have had control and custody of that block. Correct. Control and custody. How do you get custody of the block? No. You have to go to court for that. Well, did you think a big, some victim, you had to go to court. I'd probably have to interrupt after the custody. You're on a glove. You know the crime and depositives on OJ census property. Sir, I had no knowledge of anything at that point. Did you fit that? No. Okay. Did you think that possibly someone who had been involved as a killer might have deposited that glove willingly or unwittingly on Mr. Simpson's property? I did not think of any of these things at that time. You didn't think of any of these things. No. Did you think that possibly whoever put that glove there, if it was put there, was somebody dangerous? Possibly? What training do you have? What to do when you sense danger? What's your first album? Oh my God. I don't think I understand that. You don't know. The safety of the officer. I believe you said yes. Is a paramount consideration. And police work. If you could praise it like that. And then you've ordered brothers too. Okay. Let's do a break here because this is really a pond. And he's basically doing the same thing. He's brow-bating like he did yesterday. And saying, how come you were out there for 15 minutes? And you didn't draw your piece. And you were like, you're just wandering around and mading up the grass and the leaves. And all this is poshkin. Or I would say it's the same stuff he was poshkin with yesterday. And it's really ponderous man. Two open lines a day and two it brought. See what I mean about these people. We have been smoking here today. And I was about to congratulate the audience on their phenomenal comeback. Even some of the colors that had something almost interesting to say today. It's been almost a real goddamn radio show after yesterday. The worst, the most depressing day. All day long on this radio station. We felt unloved and on care we felt like we were going out of business yesterday. And all of a sudden they make this big glorious comeback. And now that we got this firm in the German on the stand in this old fart standing up there, pretending to be a hot shot lawyer, which he was 40 years ago. Now all of a sudden, well, now we got another fish to fry, baby. Open line and date 751 and two and brow or two and brow or five, two and four. And if you're going to fry some fish by the way. Get the honey tune. 1.35 at WIOD. 1.610 WIOD. Soon to be the unofficial radio station of the Miami hurricane. Why don't you go back to Canada? You do bastard. Why don't you go back to Cuba? You don't go back to Cuba? You don't go back to New York. You want bastard. 22 till 2 at WIOD. So I go through my little spiel there. And as soon as I finish that, like half of the people around their drop off again. So who's down are you kidding? Here's a note here. It says, please excuse the impersonal for my communication with you. But I'm afraid if I called and my ex husband heard my question, he would flip out. On April 7th, I'm heading to Las Vegas with 16 friends to get married. Was wondering if you could recommend a nice Italian restaurant there. That may not be so mainstream. P.S. last week to responses for the. Oh, I see. In other words, the call. What is that? P.S. to be sponsors for the Tel Aviv and shower massage you were extremely lame. I wanted to call but was driving and know you hate pay phones. Any real woman should already have what installed in her shower. So here's another woman who's big into shower power. And she's going out to Vegas to get married on April 7th. I want to know a great Italian restaurant in Vegas. Let's get some call in George. He'll take it. Call in George with a great Italian restaurant in Vegas. Like, what does she say? A great, uh, that's not so mainstream. Like off the beaten path. Like kind of beaten off. You, the pan. Emergency. And we need to act now. Yes. Did you not say that? No light of me. I mean, I want to say. You then the women's children. The old, the young, the inferno. And the wife. And the wife. You want this crap. But hurtled the wall. Yes. Did you realize when you heard of that wall? Got the mic someday via legal challenge to the propriety of your actions? No. Did you realize when you heard of the wall? That you were an exerably a part of this case. There's long as it might last. I don't think I was thinking of those things, sir. Didn't occur to you. No. Okay. Hey, you run any numbers of cars out on the street other than the Bronco, or had they been run by someone to your not. I might have run the vehicle that was just east of the iceberg gate. You might have been a foreign car. You might have been a 280 or a cellic. I'm not sure which it was. Okay. You have been east car, I have some kind. I think so. What do you remember about it? I think it was dark colored and quite cluttered in the interior. You always plane up to the judge's now. Yeah, I'm not sure. I'm kind. I'll probably go to a thing about how to remember. I think it was registered somewhere in West Hollywood or Hollywood. And when you ran it through the computer, did it just gorgeous a name. There's the register zone. I don't recall that. You remember hearing a name Brian Kaven before you ever went over the wall? No, I don't recall that, no. When you went over the wall and let the other officers in, we proceeded to ultimately to Kdo Kaven room. Correct. Yes. Did you hear any of the other detects in fire, Mr. Kaven? If he had seen this person, that he was a little bit... I'm not sure if it was an conversation, but I think more like, you know, if Mr. Simpson is in the house or the main house. But you did not hear any questions about the whereabouts of the Simpson as Mr. Kaven might be able to be a tester during the relevant. No. When the others went to an L. Kdo's suggestion. You said you were a little bit hurt and you were smart. I'm not sure. No. This is something you decided to do on your own. Yes. You got a weak detective or any of the answers they were all yours, your career. And an extra permission. But you'd be very good. They'll say, no. Did you ask permission to any of that? I'm a bit... I'm a bit... I'm a bit... No. Did you ask permission to any of them to serve? I'm a bit... I'm a bit... No. Now, when you began to talk with Kdo's, you said you didn't know that I was any more. You represent that you didn't understand that I was a kid. I was a bit... No, I did not. You have a question about... See, you have a question about the OT and crime side.

If OJ gets off and then shown how the defense lawyers are trying to... Why are you faking a voice? Is there a special reason for that? No, sir. But it sounds like it to me. It sounds like you're affecting certain posture in your thing. Maybe I'm holding a phone too close. Maybe you're holding a two-tight. And the phone, yeah. Well, if OJ gets off, yeah. How is he going to have any credibility? If OJ gets off, yeah. How is he going to have any credibility? He's going to have to be here all. What about Jimmy Swaggart? What are you talking about? I mean, if everybody watching TV now is seeing this lawyer trying to Trying to talk about this cop who is... Everybody sees it as ridiculous. Well, what do you mean everybody sees that it's ridiculous? They still got about 40% of the public think that he's not guilty. And you got about 70 or 80% of the blacks out there who think that he's not guilty. And, uh, huh? That's a given. Who are you? It's a racial thing. It's a racial thing. And it's a superstar thing. He's a black guy who happened a bit of a superstar. Therefore, there's a whole bunch of people out there. If he stood up and he said it right now, like I've been telling you for weeks, they still won't believe it. You think he's going to be able to hold his head up and... Yes! He'll hold it up.

Is it something you should have seen? Yeah, well, to commercial breaks. So they feel real deprived. Something I wasn't asked. Was there any other reason to interject Question two about the Bronco? There was a question that we wanted answered. I think it was important to know if Mr. Simpson was home. It was important to you, but... Support all of us. Have you been directed by anybody to make that inquiry of Keter Pave? No. So I take it now at this point. I think that's the problem. I've been hurt on the wall. You're interrogating Kaven. You viewed yourself as a detective. Very much in the case. No, I'm always a detective. I'm always a detective. Very much in the case. Oh, I'm always a detective. Yes. In the Simpson case. Is that your perception of yourself? Yes, I was asked to assist those in the detective. No. I'll set up for the same again. Hold you. That criminal case was driven by Mr. Simpson. Yesterday they were greeted at Ava Yellow. He's regressing. Yes, I believe he said it was OJ's beer. And you asked whether he had driven it's that night? I believe I did, yes. And Mr. Kaven responded he thought so, but he wasn't sure. He wasn't one? In school? Correct. I believe so. When he got back to the question, tell him about unusual way. Yeah, I can just see Kaven and sure right now. Get out of here. You're gay. It's 148 at WIOD. 16. WIOD. We're tired of old people idiots. And very Jackson. Oh, okay. 152 at WIOD.

Hello. Hi Neil. How you doing? Okay. Happy belated 19 plus years going on 20. Thank you. All right. Go ahead. I don't want to be like, Gaffley Bailey. I wanted you to answer the question before I interrupt the question. Yes. Judging from it, it managed you a one more time. I think Gaffley goes right in the chair immediately. He's actually so fast. I mean, he's asking questions. So if it's over some firm, it's asking F. Lee Bailey questions right now. I'm getting confused. He's relentless. I had so I seen the other day and Mano Man, just brings back memories. I love the scenes. Of course, to get the honey junior is King. That's the honey junior. I think you want when he made that card for that for you that day. Didn't sound as good as when you just recorded it. I know. I was very disappointed that day, but now that it's in the thing. Get the honey junior. Yeah. I think you got I think you got a little fatter while it was in there. Yeah. We got a little more desperate. Yeah. The driver showed down for powerful parts. So Mar and I correct. Yes. Kevin Wilde. What is he going to be driving? I don't know. I know it's walling Hennessean Jeff Gregory tomorrow. And of course, we haven't had any spot for that yet, which really, across my ass since the driver showed on was my idea. Three years ago and it's been a great promotion every Wednesday. And they're finally doing it again, which I'm very excited about. Well, maybe it's going to happen. Probably, yeah, probably on Hanks Show. Probably next week it'll be Kevin because it's they go number one against number eight. They got the top eight seeds, the top eight drivers right on the standings. So it's a walley is number one, Kevin is number two. So next week he'll be going against number seven. Whoever that is. Right. Where did this logo? I heard you mentioned about a month or so ago. It was a bad rich and it wasn't fat rich to hand-camp Saturday night. It was just a hand-camping with Saturday night. But it's a bad rich from the Neil Rogers show. Who put that in? He did. He did. He's got nothing to do with this show. I couldn't believe it. I was talking about this yesterday and I got some lip from some asshole. But this man has created a whole existence, which is fine. If he's having a good time more power to him, he's wounded for me. I mean, I didn't even go last night. I will go tomorrow for the driver's show, but he's killed me. I mean, he brings more bull crap to that table. More misinformation, more losers than I've ever seen in my life. And then every time that he allegedly has the big information and the big winners, it's always the nights when I'm not there. There were the hairputs. Oh, Dennis Dormandine and $100 horse. But by my, was all over it. But the nights that I'm there, he feeds more bull crap man. You got to bring that shovel at O.J. Had in the Bronco. Absolutely. That's the most important crap. Yeah, last coming. I want to make it up. My brother most cousin is related to this kid who puns for West Virginia. He's coming into the drip. I don't know if you've heard from James Todd's sour brun. No. He let the sour brun. sour brun. Yeah, he broke all these records and cows for punting. I hope that the dolphins pick him up because with him, it's volume. I'm sick of these ponder. But I thought the dolphin just signed a punter. I can't think of what that was. I thought they just signed somebody. I hope it's somebody who could take it from more than 30 yards and can it is for more than 10. Well, I was sure a good move getting ready to read you Robby. Well, I was not there about the brain stem that player that personnel selection, just like signing a Cleveland boy Gary. Yeah, yeah, we're really racking it up. God forbid we need some help. Yeah, I have a great deal. Back to you. Okay. Yeah, we sure that we know how to pick him. We need some help. I wonder how long before Randall Hill starts finding the more of the good stuff is done here. Well, we'll see. Here's my, me. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. I got a pick report for you. Okay. You asked one going north. Wait when you get before you get on 95. And the median. In the median. Three, four to stay trooper. That's because it's the 14 to the month. Yeah. Thank you. Okay. All right. Two late. So anyway, happy poor. That's two days away. That's why they're doing it out there this week because the Jews are celebrating poor and these cops. And by the way, I finally got to work today with that anymore confrontations from the Mommy sure is cops. I'm going to keep my eye peeled for that every day. Right after on Monday, I'm saying good things about them or whatever the hell day it was. I guess it was Monday. And then yesterday, I had that incident where the guy with the two of them pulled out in front of me and nearly hit me there on 87th street. If that happens again, I'm just going to sit there and sue your ass for about $100 million you jack holes. The kicker from the Coles is who the dolphin sign. We don't know what his name is. But he's good. They didn't find him any. Yeah. What? Start from Indianapolis. They did not sign. We did not sign him. I thought, oh, they were, oh, I see. This is another one of those would be deals. But I did see that thing several days ago that they were talking to him and they were looking at him and they were thinking about it. And he's too good. He's too good. We got this hatch here. And we got this other pansy that we had last year. What was this guy's name? Arnold. Oh, Arnold. Yeah. Wayne Arnold out there. He couldn't put it behind his puppet. When he got a stomach that big, how do I get it? Wayne Arnold. The worst two punters I've ever seen in my life. These two are stiffs that we got to let that you got last year. I got nothing to do with them. Here's some rise. Hello. Yes, sir. Yeah. I'm the first time calling. I think to show it's funny. I just want to make a couple of points. Okay. Why is it that you support only three of the four pro sports teams on here? I never hear any mention of the other. I don't hear about basketball. I'm not interested in. Especially pro basketball. To me, it's a freak show. It's just about to seven-foot guys jamming the basketball. The fun show. Well, I don't like it. I mean, I can't support everything, man. I got to go and spread it around so it's in, you know? Yeah. Even if you don't like it, you can call them in disson. You can talk about them in disson. I don't want it, listen. I don't follow. I'm not one of these guys that gets on here. I just open up a mouth when I don't know what I'm talking about. I talk about things that I'm involved in. Not like you've got to do with their games. I go to football games. Baseball, whenever they might play, I might go to some of those. But I doubt it. And that's it. I can't be involved in everything, sir. I go to Popuno Park. I go to Hylia. Fixed Don't Forever gets me my passes. I don't care about the NBA. They can stick it. Right. I have to highlight of the game. Stick it in the basketball. Stick it in your basketball. See how it feels. Okay, Leys, there'll be something in there. Got all mighty. That's it. It's going to test. Go fulfill your basketball. You jackass. Welcome, you're not interested in what I am. Cause I'm not. I'm not. I like the guy yesterday. Well, when you're gonna make a baby, man, I just, my wife and I just had her first baby. You knew you really are great. I'm not interested in making babies. How about the suds in his wife? Very happily married, straight people there. They don't wanna have no baby. And guess what? It may come as a big shock to you sir. But there's a hell of a lot of heterosexual couples out there. They don't wanna have no screaming crying babies with a bunch of duty all over their place. How do you like that? Oh really? Yeah, really. See what you like, you like. What I like, I like, and I know what I like. Believe me, I know what I like. Trust me, and I make no apologies for it, baby. I like it. And whatever you like, more power to you. That leaves something for the rest of us, okay? So good, busy, go make babies and go see O.J. No, what is it? I believe all three of those detectives, one was carrying a 2 inch 38 model 37. Where would he just say, said, what is it? One was carrying a Smith and a Wett. Starting to get like six pounds of fuel. I think this is a joke. That didn't require a proper call. What he was carrying. I was carrying a baretta. Automatic weapon. Oh, he's going to bring it. Look at that. There's the parrot on his shoulder to prove it, George. This station too big for Randy Rhodes. He's talking entertainment radio, 610 WIOD. Miami Fort Lauderdale.
