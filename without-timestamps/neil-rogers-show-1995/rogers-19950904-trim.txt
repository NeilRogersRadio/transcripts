I mean to see two of these anxious uh for a sports teams Two of these grotesque Whatever and how do you want to call them both get dumped in a tank? I think Miami getting me 31 to 8 though that was special 31 to 8 You hate both teams, but you know you got to hate Lou Holtman But you're forgetting you're forgetting something else Guess who else got his ass handed to a monopletter yesterday in Seattle.

See that boy that was great How about any I think at the list last week But the greatest call in Phil Henry history was a week ago Friday when the guy called and looking for a Man-ditch and they were talking about Bob greasy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I did great is calling the history of Phil It's the grace call and I see the human ring and he can't see a phone It was I mean you were saying you got to get the slack and the sport jacket Yeah, we're gonna have the charity function for the you know something if Rick and suds what a bit of thinking They could have saved the dead cat for a greasy exactly How would a nice holiday meal have a great life?

He was a very funny guy, but you know something when you take something that's good in small doses And you try to like make it into a big deal and you try to whisper it out. It just don't make it and they're trying so hard on that ESPN show to be funny They're not it's the same with ESPN radio where they're all sitting around with a feather up the rest laughing and puking and Carrying on about stuff that isn't even remotely amusing much less, you know fall down laughing funny And they got the sterling sharp on there now who's you know he can speak with that space He's got nothing to say And they're throwing a ball back and forth and it's like, you know They're trying to outdo fox now everybody's trying to outdo fox and fox of course put themselves in a leak of their own With that stupid the pre-season show that followed the alien autopsy the other night juvenile Pathetic the one with the Madden and the summer all the little kids on there tragic Nothing to with football then to bring out Terry guide damn Bradshaw Who doesn't have to try to be a jackass because he already is one? How about those how about those teams that just squeak by yesterday boy like Atlanta in overtime no less to be the girls team And the Steelers just barely squeak in by and the lions getting beat I'll tell you one thing yesterday of now Benny blades his team lost the lions and Brian blades out there and Seattle I guess he's not jumping high enough and running fast enough Here's Miami hello Yes, sir. How they're happily to read and back to you Listen yesterday was so interesting to watch Zeorlins almost kill San Francisco no they didn't well they almost it no they didn't they were dominated? Give it a shot that's always a tough game especially They always play the 49ers tough always Well also In addition to which you notice when the guy recovered that fumble for the 49ers at the end of the game And he kind of like dropped the ball they were yelling at him from behind don't screw up the points bread. Okay So the points bread on again they only won by two so they were just bread yeah and also Ricky waters is The Philadelphia Eagles didn't come by yesterday either. Yeah, they were nice But I got to tell you man. I mean rich coat tight speaking of the Eagles he screwed up that team entirely and now he goes to the jets and If they win two games this year, I think they'll be lucky They were absolutely fun. They are a visible But let me tell you something it wasn't important for us to pay such a girl school yesterday. I mean I'm a hardcore dolphin fan And I think it was something that we needed to do just to gel. I mean you know Demorino again. It was a chronic order to believe in that this is the year get everybody talking to big talk right? No, I'm not saying it's gonna be the year, but I'll say how I can we've got weapons and I think if we just gel That's you know that's key. I mean our defense is about to come together. Yeah. I'm glad you know that Carcine there again. I mean that was pretty scary last week, but I don't know I was pretty happy with everything that turned out I mean the score was you know was pretty pretty cool. I guess yeah I'm out of material now.

You've seen people that got those things around, right? What if Nixon would have had the same thing? I like Dick? Probably would never have got elected. The last time. Here's my, me, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. How you doing? Pretty good. I don't think you're doing pretty good working on Labor Day. I'm doing great. Yeah? That's because I'm going on vacation in a couple of days for a 10-day, so I'm doing really great. Is that starting next Monday? No, it's starting a lot sooner than that, in a couple of days. Also, you're gonna be off next Monday. Yeah? On a wonder. No wonder what? It's right after the Patriots beat the crap out of the Dolphins? No, man, look, this week we scored 42 points. Next week. No, you scored 52 points. No, you scored 52 points. Right. 52, you said 42. Yeah. Now the temperature might be 100-2. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah, that would be great. Yeah. Well, how come they held a feeling? How come they held a Browns do a 14 points yesterday? What, what, what, what office are your Browns have? Huh? The Browns are not the Dawkins. That's for damn shit. They don't have a high power. And you know what? Offends by the way. And you know what? The Jets are not the Browns. Uh, well, you just face it though. We have a better team. Well, yes, well, the one. Yes, what? I guess we'll find out one way. Yeah. Because I'm a loud talk. I've been hearing this talk for actually since 1985. 10 years now, I've been hearing the same trash talk every year. Yeah, but if I decide you know this year, we have the team. Okay, good luck to P mallet. Hey, it's obvious that you're going out vacation. Yeah, it's obvious that you'll be in our vacation. Yeah, it's obvious that you've avoid being here for the game. We're okay P mall. Yeah. You always look at a football schedule. You don't know how far we need to advance. I got a draw full of plain tickets man in my house for the next seven, eight months. And that's no lie, baby. plan way ahead. And it's a matter of fact, if I would have thought about that, I probably would want to be here to see it, but guess what, I'll be somewhere where you won't be able to see it. It did a bad break. Because what would you rather do beyond vacation someplace have a great time or see another guy damn football game? That guy that called from Palm Beach before was absolutely right. Life is more than a football game. Okay. I mean, I enjoy football. I watched my share, but life is more than just sitting on your ass, watching a dumb football game. Okay, pali. Life is like getting on a goddamn raft and early drowning. That's what life's all about, Julio, get with a program. Here's Miami, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. I got a fat hand coldberg spary port. Yeah. On his 15 minutes of fame yesterday, picking his nose on the SPN. Yeah, with those memorable picks. Yeah, they were real memorable. All for three yesterday with a push. With a push. With a push. Yeah. He's clueless. He is. He's consistent, though. And he's the big talent on QAM. There you go. That's why they got a one share. Open line in date, 751. How come I'm choking on this lunch? It's by the way from our friend at Stan State Gilly. And Sunny is our new delivery board. Oh, poor Sunny. Sunny from the market. Not to be confused. How come we're not getting those spary ports on Sunny Hirsch? I understand INZ had some grotesque technical problems the other night. And it wasn't bad enough for Sunny to take that shell acting there. 31 to 8. It wasn't bad enough that Mark Furman referred to our team as the Huracoons. That wasn't bad enough. But adding insult to injury was the fact that INZ has got the worst technical staff that they were clueless and they kept cutting out and you could hear her. Every time they thought they were. I watched that goddamn echo in my ear. Get that out. Oh, sorry. Well, first it says that's why I left. It was great. So, you know, things are changing. The old warmest turn and man. The old warmest turning. It's not important that your team wins. It's more important that the team's UD test lose. Like the Buffalo Bills, like Notre Dame, especially. And like those Huracans. 610 WIOD. Learning to be humble. But not making much progress. It happens every year around Labor Day. I don't want it to go. I need a bad American saying goodbye to Summer. If it can hurt because we don't realize the dependency we have on it. I want my Weedy come to help me. That's where we come in. We're the Labor Day Support Line. The place to call when Summer Separation is too much. I can't face the cold. Oh, you can. You've got everything to live for. No, no, there's nothing. There's Halloween. I can't do candy. Thanksgiving. Well, what about Chris who's come on sing with me. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. The Labor Day Support Line can help you too. If you're afraid of losing your summer and becoming the Kevin Bounce Slug, you turn into every winner. Call 1-800-SUMmers-GON. But don't call now. We're going away. Till next summer. Oh, poor baby. 1125 in WOD. Another one of these holidays has become meaningless except for a day off for a lot of people. And I saw a chance to go out. Good drunk. You know, 2-3 doesn't beers. And that's what America's all about. What's wrong with that? Haven't some nice sales in the malls. Everybody get a chance to go out shopping all day. Go out there, kill some people in the water. Oh, they had a thing. Was it on CBS? Where? Where did I see that this morning? About these hovercraft? About these punk steas, kids in your like individual. Oh, my God. In fact, they even showed one of the things where, my amateur film or some asshole got wiped out. And then there was this other poor guy they showed ago was done or snorkeling and he came up just as the guy came zooming by. It was an ugly thing you didn't want to see it. But hey, we don't want to have no restrictions on that on a personal pleasure craft. I mean, go out there and have a good time and kill a few people, okay? Because you never know some of them might be rafters. They're expecting to get killed anyway. Here's a Palm Beach garden, silo. Hi, Neil, happy to Labor Day. And back to you, whatever that means. Exactly. Listen, just to change the subject, just the second. I belong to an adult film video club. And every month they send an interview with, you know, one of the starlets. Yeah. And I think you would enjoy this apparently after she's done filming a couple of movies. She goes out and dances, you know, description. And the question was, do you ever have that experiencing dancing? And she says, yeah, I didn't like dancing in Canada. The managers of the clubs, I went to weren't very nice and treated me less than a cow. And it's not customary in Canada to tip the dancers. They don't tip. I'll about that. I just wanted to just say that you're exactly correct. Okay, pal. Okay, buddy. See you. Bye. Open line of Broward. Five, two, four. We have, did I mention good morning to Omar? I didn't say that. Did I? Omar, this kid who was a listener of ours. And I'm on a plane yesterday coming back. Yesterday afternoon. And here, these two guys get on a plane. And he says, hey, I know you and I said, yeah, I said, sit on my lap. He said, okay, it was Omar. I signed his little thing there. What do you autographs? And he was a good guy. Just shave a little bit. Omar, okay next time, shave a little bit. And we'll go back. You and me. So anyway, here's, you're going to be chronicle out there and protect somebody. I'm off today. Save the cop Jesus. Yeah, you're always tough. The radius cracks on the ball time. Loast pork if I heal boys. What do you think of that? Maybe you don't think of it. I think you're tastes sucks. Thank you. Did you watch the old game last night? What's game? Because it's not on the ball. The ball is game? No, the dolphin game. No, I wasn't here. All right. Midway through the third quarter. You know how to have news bulletins that flash along the bottom of the screen. The quality of it. Well, this is just to taste what's going to come. They start saying bulletins about Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands going to get pounded by a massive hurricane, etc. A lot of ways. By Luis. Now this is something. Puerto Ricans pounded by Luis and they got a big smile on her face. Yeah. Well, this is a game for what's going to happen with our home town news stations. You know, pumping up all the excitement. In the middle of a football game, something that is nothing to do with the state of Florida at all at the very least a week away. And they're pounding people. You're a party, Poper Dave. What's ball on her fun man? Yeah, but then it makes no sense because the people really were interested in knowing about the hurricane. What are they going to do? They're going to turn off Channel 4. Now turn on to one of the other news. They're going to turn on the guy named Weather Channel if they have a brain which I'm watching right now. So matter of fact, there's not a drop of rain inside. It's beautiful. It's perfect. It's perfect. The circle be up. And that's not all. It's the hurricane, it's right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Luis is up. That means so a lot of the rest of us too. Well, thank you. Yeah. Okay. See you. Hey, dude. It was a long song. Not a great song. It was just long. It's the only record that faded out for like three and a half minutes. Fainted out for three and a half. Most records, you know, that get to like the last 23 seconds they fade. You know, that's it. But not hey, dude. It just went on and on. But it was a classic because it was the Beatles, baby. That's why it was on Apple Records, which made the sueds re-elected. They didn't like the Beatles on Capitol Lab much. That was for punk kids. That was bubble gum. But once they got their own label, once they got an Apple Records, then everything they did was a work of art, a work of genius. A lot of it was crap. I did like the white album. There was some pretty good stuff on there, you know. But not of that'll ever be nominated for Best Rock song of all time because hey, what can I tell you? Although we can't play that Rocky Rack Cullin because we're playing too much of that, uh, right? Huh? Too much of that Rocky music. Here's a Davy. Hello. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? I'm one of the guys that dropped off the bubble machine Friday. Anyway, uh, dropped off one. There are files. Yeah. What, well, why are you calling a bubble machine? Do you remember he wrote that on the file and started it wrong? Oh, yeah. Did you see that on the end one? Not really. I haven't read it yet. Let me tell you. Really quick about it. Although, you know, something I went out this before I went away for the weekend, right? Right to the bookstore. Uh-huh. And I bought about a half of it doesn't UFO books. Which one? Book stop? Yeah. Are you going to want to appear at the plantation? In the saw, right? Right, right, right. Anyway, uh, I had to distinct pleasure, unfortunately, being at the game yesterday. Everybody's talking about how great it was. Did anybody call you about the invocation in the beginning? No. You're not going to believe this. They brought out, uh, Reverend whoever, for the, to the field. And he gave, like, this blessing or something to the dolphins, and that everybody would be okay. And at the end, of course, everybody's just listening and telling me that. And let the dolphins grow to the soup above the freaking place went crazy. Oh, I was dying over there. Incredible. Anyway, you're not talking about the way I'm talking about the way I'm talking about. I'm probably. Yeah. Now they're praying for the dolphins to go to the Super Bowl. That's how desperate they are. See, when you show that you're desperate, that's a bad sign. It's one thing to be confident. It's another thing to be desperate. Anybody out there know what it means to be desperate. Two open lines in day, seven, five, one. We have one on a purple line, pound IOD. We'll be watching a young and a horny, I guess, come 12, 30 because Goddamn channel 4. It's got that MDA telephone. I hope they raise a lot of money. It's a good cause that I want to sound like a communist. But get the damn soaps on there for crying out loud. Every time it's a holiday and people are captive audience, they put a bunch of crap on it. They put telephones on to try to squeeze money out of your pocket. I don't like being squeezed. Here's sunrise. Hello. Hello. Yes. I knew. Yes, sir. How are you? Okay. Good. The convention. They got a home show. Yeah. And I think it's a very good idea to do the events. Yeah. And also, did you hear about the Germanage? What do you do pay to make it a little plug on the air or something? No, he did. Yeah, yeah, he did. No, he did. How much he gave you? Nothing. 50. How blonde? No. I was walking by, so I'm there. Because I had to get some cameras done. I saw a Germanage. He said the docks of plug and girls team. Did he? Yeah, it's what they said on the on the show last night about it. He said they were playing a girls team. Yeah, it should they weren't playing a team. Where did he get that line? I have no idea. Yeah. I'll just the god. Okay. Thanks for the good news. At least he's getting honest now that managed. All right. They're playing a girls team. That's right. Mad dog. They were playing a little league. Not even a good girls team. The worst of the worst. All right. I'm not trying to take away. I mean, detract. They scored 52 points. They looked really sharp. They got their act together. They played a hell of a game. But again, they were playing against the worst team. The worst team in the league. The worst team in the league. Worst in Houston. Worst in Jacksonville. Worst in Carolina. Worst in Atlanta. Worst in anybody. The worst of the worst. And how about Tampa Bay? Oh, my god. What the was that all about? What the kind of drugs are those guys doing? Two open lines in day. Seven five one. Now that I see that the radar there's there's not a cloud. There's not even a pigeon dropping in the sky. It's beautiful. It's perfect. So come on. Let's go. Greatest rock song of all time. Let's take a poll today, alright. Let's take a poll all right. All done at the end of the show. We'll throw it in a waste basket. I got you, Daniel. There you go. Let's pretend we're taking a poll like she does every night for four hours. Wouldn't you think like a couple of hours of that cramp would have been long enough. Four hours of saying penis and 69 or whatever. She I mean enough already with that show. Jesus. Here's candle. Hello. Oh, Neil. Yes sir. I surprised no one talking about the fight yesterday in the stand. Oh really. was wonder probably better net Tyson. I was up in the end, so I was in 400 sections somewhere. And it was unbelievable to see the copper on back and for taking away dead fans. It was wonderful. No. They went one after the other. So in other words, you're telling me the dolphin fans were all very well behaved as I would. Your time may come on. Maybe someone will call later until there was some real fat red net guy to black games with no shirt bleeding in the entrance section 402. I walked over and this half hour before the game started. And the police came and took them away. I had never found out what happened to that man and why he was laying there. And if a new third quarter was a big fight, he was a top. It's two dolphin guys, you up on the jet guy. Yeah. Pretty well, not to me, to the the us their way. Right. And the cops came up there and all the dolphin guys pointed to the jet to jet guys. Didn't do anything. They were just trying to leave early and they got ejected. Oh, you're a nice guy thought it was. I'll tell you one thing. Next season one of jets come here. There's one. One thing to take care of those jets fans. One way to do it. Shoot them in the lane. Exactly. I got to pay two bad. I got another place for you. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Okay, Pat. Have a good. Open line and date. How come we got that feedback and I call what those go it on here? Well, we want it. We asked for some feedback and we got some. Open line and date 751. Purple line said it. Oh, you're in your car right now. Okay. You're grasping. You're groping. You're reaching forward in a phone too. The AT&T wireless line. That's the worst name. But we do like them a lot. But they're named closed. Don't forget, Dolphin linebacker Chris Singleton will be on with the Defotonite and managed in sports talk. They'll be over at Flanagan's in North Miami. North East Edward 25th just west of Dixie Highway. And they'll be having a great time over there. And to be high five in and low five in and grab a little ass managed where you can be sure that probably defose and it'll be great. Then of course next Monday they may not be quite as happy. Yeah, but you're going out of town. You're going out of a case and right, I plan to just so I wouldn't have to be here and hear the abuse. Here's the lady in Oakland Park. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, there she is. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Good. I'm a first time caller. Great. Don't you get sick of that? No. No? Yeah, no. I'm sick of that. Sometimes we're too cold. Anyway, I want to. We're a time caller long time listener. I have a really famous request for you. Yeah. I want to hear the asshole song. I've been telling my friend all about it. And you just won't play for me anymore. Which one? We have because it's too loud. It's on just a regular joke. Doing that tennis lyrics song. Yeah. Talk on that didn't get the greatest rock song of all time. The greatest rock song of a haul time is comfortably numbed by Pink Floyd. You know, I just put that asshole thing up there to play it for you. And now you're not. And now, well, I'm going to play it, but I'm doing it with great reservation. So take a number. Have a great day. You too, my life. Oh, my God. Pink Floyd. Oh. I'd rather hear Pink Floyd cramer. We got that. Let's play that instead of asshole. 113 can't say asshole on a radio though because there might be a lot of kids out of school. And they never heard that word. 16 WIOD. Dad, are we there yet? How could can't keep his packer in his pants? This is for the people at the CVS. They've got stupid tennis on instead of the I'm an oriented people on channel 4 when you're done. Tuddle thud, folks. I'd like to see a song about it. About me. And it's very low as no. Oh, no. I'm not on the front chest. About that special feeling we get in that hot spot. And it McBand. But not us. Maybe in the subcont� area. Maybe in the liver. Maybe in the jibis. Maybe even in the clothing. We don't hear it. Well, I'm just too great to enjoy with a regular job. I'm your average white. I'm suburban. I'm slow. I like football. And cornering. What's about to? I got an average house. Where the nice start would fall. My wife and my job. My kids and my car. I'll feed on my savings. And a cute, easy goal. But sometimes it's just kind of tough to keep a man like me. Oh, no, no way. I know I've gotta go out and have fun. It's someone else's experience. Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I try really slow. And the old professor, well, people behind me are going insane. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll be a little you'll. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll. I use public toilets. And I saw them sink. I walk around in the summer times. And I'm about to sleep. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll be a little you'll. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll. And sometimes I'm in the handy gap spaces. Well, handy gaps people. Make handy gaps of spaces. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll. I'm gonna throw you, you'll be a little you'll. Maybe I should be singing this song. Ranting and raving and caring. Maybe they're right for they tell me I'm wrong. Now I'm gonna throw you, you'll, you'll, you'll. Come on, let's go. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna get myself a 1967 panel at Yoda Rotterdam, murderable. I think with a whale's in a hop-a-can. And all other cow in the area and make brown babies realize red headlines. Yeah. But I'm gonna climb brown in that baby. It's at 150 miles per hour. Just getting one mile per gallon. It's like a now 400 feet per to McDonald's. The old fast is not quite a greatable styrofoam containers. And when I'm done sucking down those greaseball burgers, I'm gonna wipe my mouth with the American flag. And then I'm gonna toss the styrofoam containers right off the side. And then I'm gonna catch them, sing anybody can do a button. You know why? Because we got to Bob that's why, jewel words, nuclear and weapons. So, guys, Russia, Germany, Romania, they can have all the democracy they want. They can have a big democracy and take walk-right to the middle. It's the end of its square. And it won't make a lick of difference because we got to Bob. So, guys, John Wayne's not dancing. He's frozen. And as soon as we find a cure for cancer, we're gonna throw out the juice. And he's gonna be pretty pissed off. You know why? Have to over take it a cold shower. The month of why that's by 15 million times. That's how pissed off the juice can be. I'm gonna get a doof, and John says the ladies, and we're gonna make a stand-tuck and go. And a cheese or a wick. And try to do a next thing. You don't really earn that. Oh, that's just a shut up thing that's so unfaithful. Come on, Ed. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Come on, Ed. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Yes, yes. Yes. Oh. L.E. Everybody. Go. Yes, yes. Praise home, Alvin. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Go. Now, an asshole. Get out of the house. Get out of the house. Why did he throw the kiss? In other words, he was upset? No, the cake here and a dead can here. They got a birthday cake for Phil Henry. See, I thought this was all a joke. I saw the dead pussy when they brought it in in the racked up. And it wasn't unrapped. In other words, it was still wrapped in that thing with the tail hanging out. It was a tail and you can see a paw. Yeah, tail and a paw. Well, that's the best part. Isn't it? George said the tail is the best part. So anyway, and they put it right next to the cake. And he got so upset. He threw the cake out. I don't know. Was that because he lost his appetite or because, well, let me ask you a question. Why would there be anything? I mean, it cats been dead for a long time, right? It's been in the freezer, right? Yeah, that's true. Now, would you assume that there was like any bacteria on a dead animal at that point? I mean, it wasn't out in the sun rotting where they were like, uh, you don't understand? I don't know how long it was out in the sun, yeah. But it doesn't make any difference. I mean, it's been in the it's been on ice for days. Would the days, I don't know. Yeah, a couple of days. I can tell. And the dead cat in the thing in the bag was going to contaminate his cake. I think Phil is getting a little bit, uh, hysterical if he asked me.
