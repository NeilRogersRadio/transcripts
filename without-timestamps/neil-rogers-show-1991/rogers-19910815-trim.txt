and Hollywood. Yeah, Neil. Thank goodness, somebody's still on there. What's going on here? I guess those guys all ran out to get the operation. Well, maybe it's a bunch of time. Well, I'm on their doing it on their way. I listen, that's always called in a bar's door, excuse me. About his dog's wife. He was a goodie. A goodie. Oh, he was just, that wasn't for real. He was a goofball. All right. And listen, if you have a dog, you have your two dogs. If you go to a supporting. Yes, goodie. It's not always warm. I just keep it. But they're not scooting. Well, wait a minute now. Okay. That's scooting. Well, what do you want me when they start scooting? Have you like given them instructions to start scooting? I don't want them to be scooting. I got enough problems with that. All right. But every soul offered me a gift to scoot. In fact, my little dog last night during the middle of the night did something in the kitchen he hasn't done in months. And it wasn't scooting. I'll tell you that right now. Well, we started with the same letter ended with the same one. But that was about it. We all think they did it. But anyway, watch out for him. He's dangerous man. That's just a luch. Well, if either is your dog. And so deep, you're going to see one or one of you event. That's all the only class he attended. I wouldn't teach you something. I'm the teacher keys at him. Now, what is it about scooting? Take it off to the vet and tell me if you want his anal express. His anal express? He will explain to you. Is that like federal express? I tell you what it is here. In other words, if you don't like somebody, send him a package through anal express. That would be kind of sad. No. No. It happens. What time is yours, you got better material than I do. I'll tell you that. Annel express. Uh-huh. It's a truth. I just came from there that today and hit acrylic. Is that like American Express? No. Listen. When they go to the bathroom. Well, here. Let me put my hotel bill on my anal express. And you're an astronaut. You're going to tell you that lady's right. What lady is right? Oh, you mean you? Yeah. Anyway, when they go to the bathroom, something should come out with it. And when it doesn't. Wait a minute. I don't understand. Something should come out? I'm quoting. Yes. I'm quoting. Well, I really don't inspect. You know what I'm saying? I'm just not one of my, uh... I'm telling you what car. There are some people who are into that, but that's not my cup of tea if I can say that. Well, I mean, you'll say if you're going to rot. There should be a coating. I, well, I could grease, you know. A coating, you mean like on a camp, like on a soup can and a supermarket, a universal pricing code. I go. I mean, yeah. And this is in the middle of the lunch hour. And you're talking about goo on poop. All right. What kind of a show do you think this is? It wasn't bad enough that we had the thing from the Euro dynamic setter. This is a fort for your go on goal. There's, there's doing just fine without the goo, okay? Yeah, but I'm, it's ever a captain. Yeah, it's always good to be prepared, okay? Anyway, they have two little grand by their anal. And have one? Two little grand a grand on E. And I'm Mary, I'm joining in. I have to squeeze it. What do you like to push up? Pover? No. I'm not going to start squeezing my dog's glands. This is, I think. So I need to get kicked out of the neighborhood. I don't have enough baggage to carry all right. Oh, he squeezes his dog's glands in the backyard. Are you people nuts? Don't know. The SPCL be there in a half an hour. That's in the facility. It's an ascensity. I got to squeeze my dog's glands. You're maybe not. I don't think so. They were fixed a long time ago. I don't think that's going to happen. Squeeze an air glands. Listen, when the dog's going to take them to the fair. And he doesn't have form. Ascom. Does he need? I had him wants to come back in. Am I consider squeezing his. But that's about it. Listen, everybody can't do that. You've got to take through a vet or somebody did. I thought he said, I got to do it. Now the vet is going to squeeze his glands. That's right. I want the dogs. And then he empties the mouth and now my little girl. And then he's watered. The poop that they don't come out with. With their what's here come out. The coating. This is the goop lady. No. Next time you call me back, you just identify yourself. You can be the goop lady. Okay.

To hell with Elvis, Paul Simon's and Central Park tonight. Right now the hell gives a crap about Elvis. And there will be a whole bunch of people who are going to be here. They're going to be here. They're going to be here. They're going to be here. They're going to be here. They're going to be here. The hell with Elvis, Paul Simon's and Central Park tonight. Right now they'll give us a crap about Elvis. And there will be a whole bunch of people there at Central Park. And it's going to be on HBO. Let's seven o'clock tonight. No, I would not give you false call. But of course, Paul Simon's got some talents. So we don't want to get too excited about him. And he's kind of ugly too. And Jewish. Here's the lady in Miami. Hello. I need you. My first time calling. Well, great. I love your show. And let me tell you something. I do care about Elvis. But I don't think of my. What did you say you do care? I do care. What do you mean you care? What does that mean? I care about what's happening. What are people are saying? Him or not. But anyway. Yeah, it's funny. I ran into a president Lincoln. It came out yesterday was incredible. Yeah. And do you know that that beard was one of those paste on jobs? He never even had a beard. Did you ever see those pictures? No, listen to me. Did you ever see those pictures of a black and white hair? They're all those like big gigantic like bumps on his face? Yeah. I don't know. I just wanted to wear one of those costume beards to cover it up because he was growtask. You're kidding. No. Why do you? Any please slap that baby on air and came out yesterday. I said, I'll be damned. I know you anywhere. What did you ask him about Elvis? As a matter of fact, he said that you just said lunch with Elvis. Oh. At the Wayne Arnolds. Morning, Wayne. I heard you say thank you. Yeah. I heard you said you didn't want to show. So I just wanted to say. You must say the rundown. Okay. First of all, I don't believe he's alive. I think that's just a bunch of crap and they're doing that to get money to make money. You'd imagine what he would look like if he was still alive. Get out of here. Help me. Oh, Elvis. Oh, okay. Don't be mad. Oh, man. I'm really sorry. Oh, Elvis. Oh, baby. Oh, God. Oh, God. Anyway. Oh. Anyway, Neil. 79% of the people that called in actually said that they believe Elvis was alive. Of course. I can't believe. I've been talking about 20 hours of their working week. I'm thinking about it. And I'd be a big thing. I mean, I think the only reason he did that's to be show was because they killed that green creature he used to play on TV. Because he's desperate for some green and that's not a creature. Yeah. Why do I just wanted to let you know that I did see it. So what was the upshot? What's the deal? Well, the same that it was all like it could be of government cover up. Did they show sightings? Did we see like make believe pictures? Oh, yeah. They said two pictures. One of them was with Muhammad Ali and said he's an ex. And Jesse Jackson. Well, he shows up everywhere. You know what? And they were apparently this was a live show because they were saying that Jesse Jackson or any friend or relative of Jesse Jackson. If you're out there, please call him. Let us know what is that celebration now. Because Muhammad Ali did say it was Elvis. Incredible. Oh, Muhammad Ali said it. Yeah. Well, now was he coherent at the time or was he like, was this head bothering around like Linda Blair? Well, I didn't say, but I bet it was like Linda Blair. He's thinking, Dominos, I was delivering this late. But anyway, Neil, I love yourself. And I'm really nervous about talking to you. Why have you been great? Well, this is almost, I may be dead, but I'm still the king. What do you mean? I think it is. I do. Well, listen, have a great day. You've done a sensational job. Calm down. Okay, because 500 years from now, we'll still be looking for him. Thank you, Neil. And they'll be looking for us too. Oh, by the way, do you know what I go? What came? Did you spot Lincoln in? The one where they sold that Murray head a little lamb tape. Oh, okay. Same one. Maybe there's a connection there. Hmm, good being. I'm going to build a few. We'll look into it. Okay. That'll be the next show with her all though. Hmm. See you. Wow. It's 10, 19 at WIOD. We have an open line today. The Elvis thing has got everybody just going nuts. One night. I'll order to be honest with you. Quite frankly, I'd rather hear about Elvis than Luke Perry. I will say that. You know, we finally got Lion6 fixed, but the ball been here. Now, finally died out. It's been dying over here. You've got his record. You've seen his film. You'll even purchase the day-glow velvet memorial paintings of the gas station. As a true Elvis fan, you think you've heard it all. But wait, there's more. Now, you can buy secret recordings of Elvis's last telephone conversations. Yes, it's the Elvis tapes. You'll believe it. This is Elvis. Now, once you come over right now, back me a big peanut butter and never so much. A peanut butter and a never so much. Really good made to with the night. You'll hear Elvis in his most intimate moments. All these are male people. You'll see Elvis. Once you bring your word, you'll see a couple large piles. That makes it this tree. Now make a sex double cheese. Yeah, I'm home. I'm alone. And I'm hungry. And you'll hear Elvis reveal how he really feels about the one true love of his life. What you bet on, what you bet on the live baby. And I don't know your way back. But you pick up some doughless place. Make jelly, clean dough, roll this Jimmy's day this tree. I love the baby, honey, baby. Don't know. Without them, how can they do? The Elvis tapes. I'll give it to you, make it my more doughless. I've available now in Rutgers everywhere. I'll let you live among them on to the live. I'll give it a big bottle of spaghetti. You think Domino's will deliver this life? 10.55 at WIO and D. And we'll go to Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Welcome to my neighborhood. It's a beautiful day in your neighborhood. It sure is. I'll hot for this sweater, though. Would you like to know what really happened with the Hank Goldberg comment? Yes. This is the show where we get to the bottom of the truth. And we twist and distort it, manipulate and exploit it. Exactly. First of all, I don't know what these guys are on. We're calling up with these descriptions. Like the first guy, one guy who called up about the Elvis show. Yeah, it was funny. They think he's alive. They didn't get any information out of the car. The only person they got information out of was Laura. And she's in a building here. The colors are on the acid. I saw about 20 minutes of it on and off. And I know more about it than I have heard on the show anyway. But that's not why I call it. Okay. And I fell of this stuff. I was looking for the Elvis. What is it? I'm saying I was listening to the Micronary Show this morning. Yeah. The Micronary Show. And And between 9 to 10 or 9 30 and 10, there's a dolphin report with Hank Goldberg on tape. Not talking to anybody on his show or any woman. And he said, Roughly. Trying to tickle women. He said her roughly. He said, yeah, he's very. Well, he's got kind of a rough voice. Yeah, he said, trying to tickle winner in an exhibition game is like trying to pick a winner in a beauty contest of women over 30. Don't want to really stand out. That was funny. That's about your crap. Well, I get to agree. But it was not. It was a Reneri and Sony were in the room. You know, in the studio. And when they heard it, I guess they hadn't heard it. They went, oh, you know, and then Reneri said something about, Well, what a Sony know about that. Well, I don't know. And I disagree with Mr. Goldberg also as far as that goes. I think there are some very beautiful women over 30. See, I've made that point many times. Guys, after they get to be like 22 or three, they get David Johnson syndrome and their face starts falling apart. And their features get all distorted. They get ugly. Women when they're like in their late 20s and all the way, many of them into their early 40s become more attractive. Yeah. Becoming beautiful. Yeah. So Hank, a corporate at the top of Canctron, no much about. Okay. Well, that's all I have. Well, thanks. At least for straightening us. Uh, a sound so to speak. You're quite welcome. Okay. Have a good see you. See all those hookers at Salah Goldhank through like old babes. They just have a lot of makeup and they're far away.

Something like that. I want? I beg you pardon? I'm so what do you say? I only want. Once per customer. Okay. They're going to go to the Poyo Paraka. Poyo Paraka? Yeah. What does that mean? It means that we're going out for a chicken that known. Okay. I like to say something. Don't choke on it. What? It means we're going out for chicken at noon. Don't choke on the bones. Oh, and I like you very much. I like your shit. I like to say something to you. You know what we need? What? You know we have this one cart that says... Wait a minute. And offer the stockings.

We got the little girls running around screaming Elvis and the older girls and guys for some of his arteries and looking for a triple cheese pizza with Elvis's picture. That would be, now, how come they didn't do that? How come they didn't get like a pepperoni, uh, and black olive pie with the picture of Elvis in it?

At least, uh, Colombia is. Are you from Colombia? Yeah. Boy, what? Now, let me ask you. Like in Bogotá? I'm from the West Coast. What? Well, you've been to Bogotá? Yeah. I just don't want to ever go there. Uh, if you want to go there, just don't even take your underwear. They'll take them before they take your pants off. Are you cereal? Yes. Wow.

For a Colombians, man. Are they beautiful? Oh, God. Are they good looking people? I don't know about him. But seriously, you don't think so? In other words, you don't want to get close enough to fight out. Hey, the Colombians are not all drug dealers. Don't start, uh, they are all, okay. Colombians are all drug dealers. Says George. Send all your hate letters to George. George Smith. Oh, God. Who's he can? Here's a payphone in Palm Bay. Hey, you. Yes, sir. I'm doing great today, sir.

Yeah, well, that's, uh, he's been in an Alex. He's a little twerp, Alex. Alex was a little, uh, Alex was okay. Except with Adam when it was in here, hitting on him. Hey, he was so semi-a-pick, sir, in a bumper sticker. And he ever did it. Who was? Alex. Yeah, he, well, he's waiting for his own pictures. Yeah, he took all the information down.

Keep working out of pal. That's what P. We said. Have a great day. All right, bye. See ya. Why? Palm Bay. We must be putting out more than five watts today, huh? God, we're just smoking today. It's incredible. I, I just, uh, why haven't said, you know, it's just hard to figure this place out. It's just some days. You sit here and you have to wonder if there's anybody out there alive. Today we're getting calls from Colombians, no less. Trying to make drug deals on a radio. And judging from the sound of some of the colors they've already been working the outside. 26 till 1 at W-I-O-D. That is the best record of all time, by the way. But can the dirt shine with you? Now, could we have an intellectual discussion of what that means, mother and child reunion? Off the year? Not on the year. I don't think. I think I know. I think it's kind of like that other thing. W-I-O-D. I think it's got something to do with that. 1234 don't forget Paul Simon and I, H-P-O-7, a clock live in the concert in central park in New York. They're going to be all kinds of jellians, but they're not going to be carrying on. Like those little, uh, girls throwing their panties in the macy's mall. Going to be a bunch of old stone guys throwing their underpants at the Paul Simon. And then, of course, at nine, we got to watch Beverly Hills 2-903-4-5-6-7-8-2. Beverly Hills 2-903-4-5-6-7-8-6.

Let's have the other guy and with our, I, hey, I wouldn't care who was on with our scenario. If Pat Peterson and the juicy food people run their stock naked, I don't think I could bring myself to watch her a scenario. Oh, God. I mean, that, I, there are no words to describe it. The plasticness, the phoningness, the crappiness, it's exactly just stick a telephone pulled on your throat and gag forever. I mean, forget it. There about his cool as, uh, uh, a rat's, a rat passing gas in the sewer in a hot July day in Paris. Excellent job. Speaking of that, let's talk about pizza law. Man, I'm telling you, there is nothing. Well, hey, Jeff.
