Roy the weekend must have been wild in this joy. Did you see this room this morning? Man. World War III was fought in his studio. And what's with the little chair? You know, this is how one of those chairs is, what do they do? And playing footsie over here during the ball game or something? On real what goes on here in a weekend. Anyway, it's 1007 at Wiod. Dolphins are by and disappointing end to great season, but nonetheless they battled it out. There were 11 no shows in Buffalo one Saturday, Dolphins defense. Hey listen, what can I say? Was a great game? We gave it our best shot and the problem was we have no defense. Secondary was not existed. Mr. Bigmouth, McIer, got burned over and over again, but it was great. It was a great year. We went 13 and 5. And when you come right down, we'd lost only five games out of 18. And the five games we lost were all the teams outstanding teams in a playoffs. Two to Buffalo, one to the giants, one to the Raiders and Washington. So it was a great year and life goes on and next year's going to be bigger and better and all of that stuff, right? What have we got about 38 hours before D-time? We should have a little thing going. And I don't want to make light of tragedy and grotesqueness, but I will say this. I can only speak for myself. I'm not going to sit here and be more, but regardless of what world events are. And you're going to get enough of that. I'm CNN and C-SPAN in every world. So we got 30 seven hours and let's see, 51 minutes. Should we have like a countdown like they do on Channel 7, a really exploited? Don't you like the way the media does these things? Just exploiting world tragedy and potential death and the horrendous matter what it is. They're right there to exploit it and jump on top of it. Right, Sally? Tom Jick has got a really idiotic column speaking of stupid. I'm sure Rick and Duttle have a few things to say about that about the ratings. At a boy, Tom, you know, one thing I'll say about Tom. Very few people are perfect, but Tom is perfect in terms of having no credibility, left whatsoever because it's just just reaching and struggling Tom. It's just amazing. I wouldn't even dignify the column by reading it on the air. That's how pathetic it is. I'll leave it to them. I'm sure they'll have one or two choice comments. One other people don't act the way you want them to. Does it frustrate you? Are you tired of the press writing stories that tell the whole truth about your incredibly sorry life?

FOLLOWED BY HANK GOVER WITH A SPECIAL GEST Abehurstfield, that's why I just played that bit okay, HANK? If it's a little moist in here tomorrow morning when we come in, we'll understand. All right, let's take a cool from North Miami Beach. Deal. Yes, sir. How's life? How's life at F.S. Pacific, defensive, yalling? I have no life. I mean, what does it take for these guys? Sir, let me ask you a question. Yes, please. What are you crying about? What's your problem? Because I really, you know, I mean, how can you go off air and expect to win a ball game when you let up either a field goal or a touchdown? I mean, it's on the other team, you know, get their hands on them. We lost, okay? We lost to a better team. So a better team? Yeah. They suck. Yeah. And what about you? Do you suck? No, sir. That's not what I heard. 10, 28. At WIOD, we have two open lines in date County, 751. See, not a dolphin fan anyway. He's just an OASROM provocator. You can tell up by the tone in your voice, okay? We lost a game. We're getting ready to go to war in this guy's hysterical because we lost a game. You're a jackass, pal, okay? Here's Andrew Dice Clay. For Dicerone. All right. Let's say you're eaten. You're sick and, in tired of impotators and that stole top. Do like me, honey. Eat this. Dicerone. Come on. It's almost as simple as you. Put up in bag enough. In pot. And you turn on the. Install. You think you can manage that honey. Hey, butt up, thing up. In things done. So remember, Yankee Doodle came to town right now. On a phone he stuck up feather off his head called it. Dice Aroni. Oh. Oh, no. That's a key. He's a street. Oh. Hollywood. Hey, buddy. Here we go. What's happened? Now we've got a live one. I was at Latvian, Edron Friday. Great place. Excellent place. I saw Johnny in the dark. Johnny, dark was there. Johnny, dark was there. What's that? Was he paying for his meal? Or was he screaming? I'm a Johnny dark from the coast. And I want to feed him. I had some broad with him. I think he was putting a tap. Probably. Anyway, Carol was very nice. The food was excellent. I wanted to thank you for your recommendation. It's outstanding. Services great. Food is fantastic. They give you enough for six people. You can't be with a stick. I was over by you on Friday. I was the one in the Cowboys. I dropped off my check for Camilla's house. And I forgot to pick up my tape. What is the vet's number where I can get in touch with her? 751. Right? What's her number? 751. We share the Broward number. I know. 5, 8, 3 something. I don't know. What's the bride? I don't know. What's the bride? I don't know. What's the bride? I gave it to the date number. Isn't that something? I just have a mental block. 751. I see them too much football. Yeah. I must be at. 751. That's serious. I've called that number a million times. But I have no idea what it is. Anyway. They need something to do. Okay. A couple of the things I thought the way Sammy Smith was running, I think he looked like Bo Jackson on that. Well, let's not get carried away. Not like Bo, but he played a very strong game. And when a chips were down in two playoff games, he played out standing. He really was good. Got to give him credit when he deserves. Mark Logan sucks. Well, hey, that was a turning point right there. He just caught guys. He coughs it up at the big time. And McIra, of course, big mouth. Nothing to back it up. They made a full lot of mojist embarrassing. And Andre Reed and Lofton just, what can I say? They beat us badly. Louis Oliver was pathetic and the defense did not show up. Early Supervoa prediction, 31 17, 9, is over the belt. Yeah, no snow sweat. See ya. Okay. Miami. More and now. How you doing? Oh, not too bad. Went to the pizza waffle last week for the first time. It was great pizza. Great pizza, John. Boy, there's nobody like Jeff Cohen and a pizza loft and that stuff. Yeah, he came over to my table and, after the food was great and I recommended anybody. I was talking to a girl last night and tell her, I have seen. She missed going to the pizza loft once she was here. But her two brothers and Neil is going to just want to call him douchebag, the Tomasco Brothers. Oh, the Tomasco brothers. No Taurus need douchebags. Yeah, I think they might have been in the Godfather. Okay. All right, Neil, you think they hang out with Andy Garcia? Yeah. See ya. Hello again, you rock. I'm Leslie Haseem and this is your Rocky Top 40. Going number two this week and see you more summer. So, come on down to up to us, come on. For a great deal and I knew or previously old camel, just look at this little drama there. She's a real spirit. Yes, this is the camel that sells itself. Hey, gunner, here today, gun to motor. Dusty minstrels and now the bag dad Phil Harmonic with their addition of Beethoven's guitar. Wow, 1054. At WIOD, I must have been the final tube just hit the grout. WIOD, Halcy and his in a trance. Who's this amazing? I got two people in there instead of one, I still have to answer the phone. What does that tell you? Now we are, you're well worth the money. Tell me, I'm quick on the trigger, sir. That's where Rogers used to say and that's why the SPCA was very unhappy with him. What is it now? I don't know, you tell me. Anyway, go back to the Godfather first. All right, now we're talking some serious business. Let's put the family in charge of this whole operation we can wipe him out in about 20 minutes. All right, beginning of Godfather Part 2, they've recently told you what happened to the commenza, but they don't really get into it. When they were at the christening or not the christening confirmation with Evadnavada and you saw it. Wait a minute, wait a minute, they were at the confirmation? Well, what was the answer to the party from in with Anthony? Not to be getting. When they were in the hospital, yeah. There's an Italian bar mitzvah. Exactly. And they're in Las Vegas, Vagaletaho, whatever. And you see Frank Pan-Tangely drinking out of a hose. Yeah. And he says, friend, oh, friend, oh, you look great. He points to the front of the Zah, man. Frank, seeing you reminds me of the old days in New York. You know, it commends there and all the 70 points is too. He points and tends to be points to a black armband on his arm. Yeah. It starts like, like, go like, oh, oh. And friend is like, yeah, I heard about that accident blah blah blah. No, I said, Willie Cheachy said, no, man, I was no accident man. You see what I'm talking about? I need to talk to your brother, but the risotto brothers. So apparently he got wasted by the risotto. Oh, are you sure? I'm positive. Oh, wait, but wait, you're talking in a second movie. In a second movie. Oh, okay. Yeah, so you know, but in the first one, at the end, when that scene where a K is in a kitchen, what, wiping the dishes with her schmata, he comes in. There, he comes in and Al, Neary comes in and airs his and Michael on this thing. And the big room there. And of course, they close the door. Exactly. She don't want to see Clemens or Kiss Michael on the thing. But then it doesn't matter. I can't blame it. All they tell you, and I had to see it like you got with you. You got to watch it three or four times to be really catch every little thing. That's correct. I should have million times. And I try to be at the beginning. They just tell you, they don't tell you what happened. Apparently they're making it believe that some of the people want to believe that. I'm ending with Kill by accident, but he wasn't. Well, you know, I threw it in a waste basket because I had glance at it. Somebody sent me a thing. This could answer a lot of quite hurters. This is the, as it says, as the godfather tries for another hit fans count the family casualties. And it's got pictures like Carlo and his actor, Gianna Rosso, Russo, who's now 47. It says he's been in 23 films and TV shows. All is against her. Right. Since his thing and godfather won and he got married to Connie, it says Russo also turns nightclubs with a sing act based on the film and its music. And Robert Duval, now let's find the Richard Castellano. I'm sure it's, is it in here? That to be. It has to be. How could we miss, uh, here he is. It says, uh, Richard Castellano who brought considerable weight to the role of trusted couple of men. That's not the way to write. Was dropped from godfather one after, or from godfather two after he demanded an expanded role in salary. Um, died of a heart attack. So Clements of the script explained that of a heart attack in godfather two. That's what it was. And then she said, not, that wasn't no heart attack. Okay. That's it. He appeared in night of the jugular 1980 in several TV films before dying of a heart attack at the age of only 55 and 1988. Right. 55. So it goes to show you that fan ain't word, uh, words. That's exactly. But that's what they said to be getting your show. And then I was saying to say, hi, I heard about the heart attack and it really cheats you were saying, no man, that wasn't no heart attack. Yeah. I think the data will play the Boston sausage. That was surprising. I was surprised to see how near Ian parts three. Yeah. I mean, I was like, bro, that was good. I kept some cotton. Cotton, cotton, you do to it. I need it. Correct. I'm dying all the way. Right. That's what Clements has said. Have a great life. Hi, I'm here. Bye. See you. South Miami. Good morning. The Ohio doing. Okay. Uh, I'd just like to say the dolphins and a fantastic game. I've had it there last. And that's no really brought back memories of the snow plow game. Yeah. And by the way, if Rick Raleigh is listening, I don't know if you were listening on a Friday Mr. Football, somebody called and said, well, you know, it's going to be snowing up there this weekend and those dreaded bills or a bunch of cheats wasn't it against the bills. We had that snow plow. Rick, I hate to break the Anus deal was against the New England Patriots. Uh, years ago, we had that famous snow plow incident when the guy came rushing out on a field clear the path and they kicked that field goal to win three to nothing for New England. But it was the same general northeastern area. Yeah. The name focus that camera and that snow plow. Yeah. Scary. Going back to the godfather, Neil. I don't know if you saw the most recent James Con movie. No, I heard it's great. Is it? Is it very good? Is it still playing? Yes it is. Well, I'm going to go see that. I'm not going to go see a dancing with wolves because that's uh, uh, as long. Is it? It's very long. How about the movie? Oh, no, misery is not. Misery is a nice short to our movie. Great. I mean, I don't mind the movie being long if it's like an epic, you know? Right. Like on father. Godfather or Fantasia or something like that. But three hours of Kevin Costa, right? I don't think I could handle that. Exactly. So I got something for you, Neil. You might want to leave that in the background, but I got something for you asking about this today. Here it is. Ah, Godfather. Godfather. Oh, I love it. Alright, bring in the canolees. Now come on, everybody dig in. Bye. That's the best. Thank you, sir. You made my week. That was. Don't you love that? Great spots of all three movies where they have those wedding and the dancing and dining and dancing. If you'd like Joey Carras, I'm going to come right out with a canoleon as face. Aren't they? Or weren't you listening to what I just said? No, they are. I love that. I'm so excited. He played that. Ché Lalu, not up, but I'd like more canicking. She can whip up spaghetti dinner like nobody's business and looks like she's had a few in her time too. We have an open line at date, County, 751, pasta, 751, 9463. How's the Pope feeling this morning? Give a little glass of warm tea. That'll let you hear him up. You know, is the Pope hasn't stuck his nose in any of this yet? They're probably still busy counting the money over there at the Vatican Bank. Just a little joke, it's just a joke, of course. And that what they always say at the Vatican, when they have like 700 million missing, it's just a joke, bad accounting. There's no accounting for bad taste. Medley. New. Yes, sir. Don't you think it's ironic that even though you liked the hurricane-based ball team and dislike the football team, it was a baseball team that can't your asses in an announcer? Guess what? What? They didn't. What a jerk. First of all, I didn't work for the station at Curriedham in Channel 33. I did for a year on TV because Ron Fraser asked to me to do them and then Channel 33 didn't carry him the next year. So I hate to break the news to you, Jackass, wrong information. Okay, bad information. But I'm glad that we're making you days. You can answer it. I'm not going to punch it up. When I, why are you so tentative in there? Now, she's getting gunshot. She's like, said, I'm who's saying she's getting a little gunshot. She goes to pick it up and she looks at me like, oh, is he going to pick it up first? Like, we're in some kind of a contest here. Here's a pig report. Yo, let's get to the important stuff. Okay. We got them. We got them. They're lined up. All right. The world is safe. I'm sorry. I said, at least we know the world is safe now. Yeah. Line up, Cypress Creek, Northbound 9. I've, they got one in the bush. His home is radar thing. And he's, he's picking them out. And then they got about count of nine up the road, pulling them over. And he tells them what he told them. And then they give you the thing. Yeah. And then you got to go and give them the money. On real. Can you believe it? Well, now that I said, we're safe for all time. Oh, yeah. We're about to go to war in about a couple of speeders. Outstanding. And the sad thing is that's part of the 95. That's a section of the 95 that's been finished. And it's about 19 lanes across. And the speed limit, I think, is 45. I mean, so I think it's. Well, it's another rip off. That one of these planned, let's do some business deals. Well, look, we're sure on money. The poor lot in the came in found out the state doesn't have any money. And we got to cut his salary in half. And everybody's getting cut. Sife, then I have a good time next four years. Oh, yeah. Have a great day, pal. Wait, wait. Okay. We can handle it all, right? You'll appreciate this. I'm heading down the turn, but honey election. This is a couple of weeks ago. Late at night, there's no game. Nothing going on. I want to pick that toll. It's a quarter. Yeah. I give them a $5 bill.

Maybe she could feed some stale prep-lock to us. That could do it. Miami. Yeah, Neil. Yeah. I wanted to ask you if you know about the only Coroleon that gets killed. And the guy that did it gets away with it. Remember, in the first movie, Michael Coroleon goes to Italy. He gets married. Yeah. Yeah. And the guy blows her away in the car. Yeah. He's never been killed. That's right. They never caught up with his act. He has it for the rest of the movie. I read the book The Guy Father. Men and women years ago. Oh, did I.

We've been last week and they were talking about some people with a handful of talk and beside him the whole time. And we had two people, they kicked him out. Good. You know, they were like, we don't want sure type in here. What were they doing? They were just steady talking. I guess they hadn't seen the first two. What were they over 100? About 90, yeah.

I want to get an update on what happened Saturday at JRS. And don't forget, I'll also we got word that the Super Bowl is on channel 10, not on NBC. I don't know. I don't think that's right, but that's what our audience said in their full of crap. But anyway, how was the crowd Saturday? One of the things that I was racing as fast as I could when I heard your right, Nick. I heard your, heard your plea for money. And Tony, who volunteered to get us some stakes and we didn't take advantage of him, said, well, at least I can do is give $50 to Camilla's house. Great. So I have that 50 on me. So that's $110,058.

It was. And a thousand people, six out of more on top and 400 more on bottom. A couple of hundred were just watching. Yeah. Okay. Well, it was a great game. It was a rest. All I can say is that Rich came over to the house, brother, summary and saying, which that he indulged in, still horse. I mean, it was a wonderful game. Yeah. I went nuts when Duper got that touchdown. Boy, it was just, that was a great run. And I walked into a gas station Saturday night. And I had on my zoo bus and my dolphin sweater.

Oh, what we would give if she would only call back in her two open lines and Broward right now. She'd just be so nice as to call back 524WIOD because we need the soothing side of a woman voice. Right? Well, lady in candle. Hello. Oh my god. I can't. I don't know. Are they all hiding under the bed or something? Let's go in on. They're all like just rising. Good. So how are you? I'm doing okay. I saw the Godfather. It wasn't bad. I wouldn't say it was like a classic or anything. You wouldn't? No. It was okay. Well, okay. It's better than Elstinco. Yeah. I like good fellows though. I like good fellows a lot but not as much. Really? Well, it's hard for me to sit that long without getting it. I mean, when somebody's got that many zits, it's hard to keep concentrate on the plot. But I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. He looked like, who's that guy in the football? The guy from Boston will make Donna on a bed. I don't know. Well, that's okay. You're lucky. Movies. I'll talk movies on. I think that's football. Okay. Anyway, I liked Godfather. It was all right. And I didn't think that the couple was daughter was that bad. I know you couldn't stand her. I know. I know. She did a little plastic surgery. What? Other than that, she looked Italian. Yeah. Maybe the other was centered to Iraq. And put a paper sack over her head. She could say it's in the bag, Dad. I think I don't know about the acting ability. But we, we, we're acting into her appearance. We're like what El Martino's voice in Godfather Oneys. And my voice is weak. Can't wait. Remember that? Yeah. I'm trying to rent those movies. You can't get them anywhere. You haven't seen them? Oh, yeah. Sure have. But I want to see him again. Well, everybody in their brother has got. In fact, Stan made your better bringing back Godfather two one of these days soon. Come over in Bart. I had a virgin copy. Never even taken out of the plastic coat thing. Plastic or plastic. Plastic. Plastic. And maybe it exploded in his VCR. Well, it's a sad situation. So I figured I'd, like I watched the Godfather Oneys two while the war began. Exactly. Right. Be some good escapees in for you. Definitely. Better watch in Channel 7 News. I tried to avoid that at all costs. Yeah, excellent taste. Have a great day. Thank you, too. Thanks. 1234. We had a nice lady collar already one and it's only a two and a half hours into the show. Boy, the women are really just laid back, you know what? Just a very recalcitrant. There's an open line of date county, 751. Broad. That's what you're getting going. 751, WOD. Some of that horrendous sexist crap that Alex Bennett and the pengellet used to spew on that show. Now when he was your man, talk about a sexist pig. I need some cheese cake. I need some cheese cake. We got you in cheesecake right here, Alex. Put it on your head, people. Think some hair group back. Markets down 33.5 points and we'll continue probably sliding throughout the day in the days to come. I would sure seem that way. Great party, huh, honey? Yeah, I guess. Even when he was kind of the day to high. Say, had you tried to do your durs? Yeah, yeah, the clam dip was delicious. Clant dip. Well, we're not serving any clam dip. From the twisted nose of George Lucas, it's attack of the very congested people. Look out, it's gonna... Hey, it's time to book by Ian Flaming, directed by Sneeson Spielberg. Oh no! There's something you... No! You tell yourself that it's only a movie, but it's not a attack of the very congested people. I'm sorry I get those as a joke. Ooh, it's all my little balls losing its voice. They're 12.39 and WIOD. I love these things. Isn't they amazing how I found it in that mong and the cabinet in the carpet cabinet? Great. Here's a mobile in Mord Gables. Hey, bro, didn't you bow going to Buffalo? Hey, Bo, how you feel? Got that little hip pointer, huh? Yeah, I heard you little new, but I'm going to go there and run... What might he couldn't do? I'm going to run right up there. You know what? Yeah, I bet. And I'm going to eat a buffalo to get a Super Bowl ring. Okay. Talk to you there in the... See you, bro. 1240 at WIOD, Bo is a little pain there, and of course, OJ. OJ and Bo walking off the field together. Wasn't that something? Wow. Give me a break. We have an open line in the star line. Star IOD. Let's go to Pompano. Hey, now how you done? Okay. Listen to talk about a lighter side. The clubs, they got a couple of good players. Me and my partner were talking. I was wondering if you remembered. They got Danny Jackson as another pitcher. George Bell? They got George Bell, but didn't they get another pitcher? We got... I thought they'd read on Dave. We got Danny Jackson. We got the George Bell. We got one other...we got...what's his name? Who's the other guy we got? What's that other pitcher, dude? Who's the other guy we got? We got Danny Jackson, George Bell. We got three guys. And there was another pitcher. And we couldn't remember who was either. And Sandy co-fax. Yeah, right. He's still alive. Sandy's still alive. Are you nuts? Of course. There's a drive. Way back in my deep head of Top Zoya. Top Zoya. I can't think of it. Isn't that something my mind is like a blank? Yeah, because we were... Well, no, we had like three major signings. I've got first Danny Jackson and George Bell from Toronto. And then we saw... Oh, from Houston, we got the Dave Smith, the relief pitcher. Oh, that's right. That's right. It was a relief pitcher. Yeah, the outstanding relief farmman from Houston, who's about 100 years old. They're going to be great this year. I think so. With Austin and Bell in the outfield. And Desenzo in between him, like a Salami sandwich. Well, they were thinking I'm getting rid of Jerome or... Oh, please. Well, it's not too late yet. Not too late yet. Put him in the desert. Well, they're going to be number one this year. Amen. Thanks a lot. That's going to be a hell of a year, right? Oh, let's go! You bet. It's a 1242 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward. What's it a today? The 14th of January. It's like about five weeks away. When spring baseball camps open, isn't that what everybody's concerned about? Isn't that what we're counting down to? You bet. Hi, Alia. How you doing, Neil? Okay. I left the guy following me. But I didn't like this one. Good as I like the other one. Well, that's the way it goes. No, it was all right. It wasn't the worst movie in the world. No. But, you know, I just thought it was just like incomplete. You've seen it out, but they showed it in the commercial. You didn't see it in the movie. Right. That's true. That's true. In fact, the whole commercial, more of the hell with those scenes. Yeah, so, you know, then I got a little bit of a little longer. Yeah, another 45 minutes. It would have been great. A little bit rushed. Yeah, it made. Some of his weight around and kill a few people and stuff like that. I let Connie throw her weight around. Yeah, that's true. And boy, Andy was like small, he's still learning. But Connie is the seasoned motorist now. She's tremendous. You know, a couple of starter. She has enough lips there. Oh, John Holmes could have got lost in that. Unbelievable. She's, I'm glad she's dead. At least, you know, she can't come back. And left, they bring her back like, you know, well, he's trying to remember. Like, Reeva on a guided life. You bet. All right, enclosing. I have something for you, right? Yep. Okay. Don't think that on. It's off. Just relax. Don't get pushy. I am the air to go. The parade is the best. All right, take care, Neil. Okay. Well, that's good. We're still planning. We should be. It was a great season. And all you negative people who want to seize upon a fact. We got beat the other day in our defense. Don't to join out. Hey, up yours. Okay. But you're front running douchebags. We don't need you. People we need to real-fail. Yeah. That's sexy. Yeah. Come on. You're fine. All right. I'm Bob Villa. I hope to join me this weekend for another edition of this old star. The show where we remodel Hollywood has been into hot new properties. Last week, we converted Sunny Bona from Sharesx husband into the mayor of Palm Springs. Here. Cool. I've got some doing. I'll tell you. This weekend, we'll continue our Donnie Osborne project. As I bring in a demolition crew and have Donnie's entire family torn out. So, see you this weekend on this old star. Right here on PBS. Your public begging station. It's. Ha ha ha. Couldn't have said a better way. So, Bob Villa. Say it right. Villa. Hate the way he says that. Making ton of money with Sears now. But the man is just Villa. Why do you say that Bob? I think he's built too many toilets myself. That's a problem. Anyway, let's go to Miami. Shall we? Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Sounds pretty lively for Monday. Yeah, not too bad. Before I forget the main reason I called was to find out what's available on the Camille House material and how to send in the contribution. What's available? Yeah, the T-shirts are taped. Yeah. Well, the best of Neil tape is a 20 bucks or more I'll do it. And the T-shirts are like, um, while it was 200 bucks by mail. Uh huh. That's the T-shirt of the. And the tape. Yeah, T-shirt and the tape. 200 for the T-shirt and the tape. Right. Okay. And the reason the Dalton's past defense looked so poor. So the other day was that they were blitzing too much. And that left the Louis out there by himself. Blitzing in the middle. How got news for her? They were blitzing man. I'll tell you one thing. They sure weren't to accomplish anything. They should have been blitzing. Blitzing, yeah. She'll be blitzing and the, um, what's your call? It's canolies. Yeah. Okay sir. Big time, Neily, and I enjoy the show. Thank you. Let's take a pig report on a star line. Hey, Neil. Yeah. What's going on? Oh. We're here. We're here. Okay. You start with what's going on? Yeah. That's mildly response. I listen, uh, the true business fan like everybody else. I hate these people who say they were lucky when they be Kansas City. I remember them saying people are the ones who said something about the imperfect season. Hey, pay no attention to the right. I don't know. Those people are like suing. They're like slugs. We should just put them down the sewers and flush the way with the rats. That's true. I want to ask one thing. I just start listening to you and I hear your biggest fan. You got to like, about the bacon. You bet. A real place would living in breathing people and a lot of fun and excitement. That's what that's what's in it. Okay. I went out there six months ago, state of the garage was a really nice place. Yep. What I wanted to know is maybe I'm wrong, but does everybody seem to have a spior stick out there? Everybody's like looking for tips. They have their hand out. No, I didn't see any of that. That's the opinion I got. I stayed the garage and the guy in front of me gave the room clerk or the guy you know, taking the room reservations and box. Yeah. And then the guy we went to the stupid, you know, like me to see the Hoover Dam. Yeah. And the guy that was doing a commentary on the bus, he was saying that everybody works on tips. So people were given him tips, you know. And I'll see that. That's going to be a couple of way to make it. First of all, you did it all wrong. If you're going to go as a tourist and be sucked in all those tours and be a schlepper, that's what's going to happen. Okay. If you just go like a real person and you pay no attention to that and you go around and see your rent a car and do your own stuff, then you do it the right way. Yeah. I guess that's right. I don't encounter any of that in Vegas. Yeah. This is our first time. So we didn't know. You were learning the ropes. Yeah. You were learning the ropes. All right. Thank you. Okay. Bye. I don't listen to the one to two hours. Wouldn't be prudent at this time. You grew up with them both. Adal and Lure Records proudly presents the greatest hits of Simon and Bowing Cole. We had you gone for this bad enough. The test your is the only way to help you. Yeah. Bowing Cole. Who? We caught it live in Central Park and Frostbite Falls. The music of Paul Simon, the lyrics of Mr. Noin Hall. I'm singing on this radio stage. But I got a more than animation. You know, you'd be a judo. Simon and Bowing Cole's greatest hits. I am a moves. I am a moves. I am a moves. It is Paul. But it's not hard. It rocks the same. Because Moose is Ne. It is Ne. I'm an emboowing Cole's greatest hits. Now, that's Mr. Bebody's records and tapes. Ladies and gentlemen, Richard slumber! Hey, Pico! If you love Sweaty with the hits, then you'll love my newest workout video. Sweaty with the dance. Let's welcome the fake bully. Hi, there! Okay. Let's get busy. Nobody in the world is threatened like Saddam Hussein. And now, you can fight with him. Go ahead. Get rid of those fake dance. Army, Navy, Air Force, Florine. 30-year-old Yankee does have to do anything. Ever since 18, A-Wiq and Stel. Good, puppet, furious threat to your heart. So if your middle is going east, west and south, sweat it out with a fully of bagdap, it's the perfect workout when you've bitten off Moose and you can do. Sweaty with Saddam. Ooh, I feel the first. Feel the end. One time, Ben Greenman, Rips, Awakening. He's got a review in here today that would make hear it grow on the bottom of your feet. I'm telling you. Rise and wine. Even a fine effort from De Niro. Can't rouse Awakening. He rips the crap out of Robin Williams. And I won't take the time to read the whole thing. Because that would be a terminal. But the last paragraph says for those of you waiting to waste your three bucks or five and a half whatever it is to go see it. In the final disappointing analysis, Awakening's is irresponsibly ignorant of the groundwork lead by previous hospital dramas. Watching this film is like sitting through one floor over the cook who's nest on video tape in slow motion. Or the small screen on the snail's pace castrate all that was dangerous in Randall Patrick McMurphy. And drain all that was interesting in human frailty. Despite the buoyant epiphany. Ooh, of Dineros acting. This is a clumsy, big-hearted dog. A shameless tear-jerker. And for those very reasons and almost certain academy award nominate. But did you like it, Ben? Boy, Rips the crap out of it. Stephen Zaleens, Flabby, script with its unexciting pacing leaves Dineros riffing into empty air. Rolling his arsenal to the front lines of a war that does not exist. Ooh, just ripping it a gigantic huge. But mobile and Fort Lauderdale. Deal. Yes, sir. Yeah, I want my way to go soon. There'll be two more people here tonight. Great. Hungry brains out, sir. The horses are hungry. Yeah, I know that, but I think they're going to feed me tonight. Anyway, Sale, good luck. Last thing you were just talking about this awakening. I didn't see it. But I got to tell you that. I imagine this reviewer is right. Because I got very concerned when I read Candace Russell's reviewer. What she said was the greatest thing in the world. Oh, boy. And I think she's brain dead. I would like the doors and stay inside it. Yep. But now about the reason I call. Okay. I don't think that all of the dolphins in the arena, one of which I am not should be whining about the fact buffalo actually won the game. Well, who's whining? Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Who's whining? Well, that's what I'm hearing. Okay. I'm hearing about you walk buffalo to get creed, etc. And you're waiting. Wait a minute. Wait a second. Are you taking control of him? No, I'm having a conversation because you're putting words in my mouth. Well, I wasn't finished looking. On the other hand, I have to wait till your finish is that how conversation works? Yeah, really. No. Generally conversation is like interplay. You know, back and forth. And I would have listened, but you're trying to pull words in my mouth. Not at all. What I said was that the better team won the game. Okay. We played a great game offensively. The defense didn't show up. It was an exciting game. The better team won. Regardless of the outcome, I don't like buffalo. I don't like their fans. I don't like the team. I don't like Kelly. So I hope that they get their brains picked up by Oakland or Sirbio, LA, rather, or by San Francisco. That's why I feel about it. Is that okay? That's not saw or grapes for the fact we lost. I wasn't necessarily saying you were saying a lot of the people that were calling in, but more importantly, Neil, you're very fortunate to hear. Wait a minute. No, the next Monday, Jay. Okay. Party. Go ahead, sir. Every talking to my car wash guy. Every 20 years, I make a football prediction. Yeah. The last one was when the jet. Well, I'm sure that the entire audience is sitting right on the internet. I want you to remember where you heard it for. All right. Here we go. What's it? We'll see it all in New York, Super Bowl. Uh-huh. Buffalo and the New York Giant. The Giant's turn to take care of San Francisco. Yeah. Buffalo will wipe the raiders' clocks. Okay. It could be a great Super Bowl. Okay. All California Super Bowl 49ers and the raiders. Here we go. Okay. He's coast in a west coast, pal. What, huh? I see if these coast versus the west coast. Okay. Well, just be very careful when we're majoring in that direction. Okay. Good luck. Yeah. Okay. You think it's going to happen? Yes. I think so also. Okay. Let's try sunrise on a day line. Neil. Yeah. That was a chair. You can go ahead and see what you're doing. That's the thing, yeah. And Rick and Suts with Agon a question about Suts. Yeah. He stands in a green man. See if it's all. Really? He just, I mean, Rick is great in a whips the crowd up and such as Suts. Well, first of all, you got to understand. Suts has no interest whatsoever in football. Any show to, he's getting no personality. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I don't understand why they slept him around and forced him to be there. I see. I don't go for that kind of stuff. Let the guys sit home and watch him move here. Yeah. Exactly. While watch, see, Span or something, he's interested in. No interest in. And of course he's part of the show. So we has to be there. I mean, don't let the crowd go in and it was nice. The ball, I'd love to let me also tell you this. Just for your information, Rick Wally also has no interest in football. None. Zero. Was it an act? Yeah. Oh. He's just a better actor. I think Gilbert was great. Well, I don't know. Well, if you like Gilbert, what more could you want? He didn't know. He didn't. That says it all right there. The Dawson's an ABC. He thought the game was on channel 10. Oh, man. Then somebody told him and he put them to see over it. Well, that's our secret weapon. We're going to have a bargeal bird by the way for the coming couple of days. I mean, what they're going to do is. Well, huh? Maybe they'll keep them over here. Exactly. Put them in a cupboard. There you go. Yeah. I was also a track on Saturday night and you would be on my mind and you picked a one horse in a six race. Yeah. And it was a good call. You mean the one I had 20 and 20 on Peter ran? I like a champion, you bet. He bucks to win five, 20 to show. Eight to 20 to eight, 60 to win. Oh, 20 to play. That's 20 to play. So the good call. You bet. Hey, listen. I sat there. I had, I loved. The one of them was Ralph Cramden with David Engraham. Yeah. I sat there. I didn't listen to me. I sat there. I did not play the race. He was seven to one. The last flash he goes from seven to one to nine to two wins like a champion. I mean, unlike last turn, he opened up five coast at home. Payed 1180. And the other one was that pay-view horse about two three races later. The three horse I can't think of the name. Right. And one like a champion. I had him with a wrong horses and a perfect in Kevin Wallace with Jean-Lafitte, the douchebag, whatever. He's got a second. He's got a, you know, a real air and got second. So beat me out of the perfect. Did you put that rough cream to know? No, I sat there and watched it and I wanted to blow my brains out. Uh-huh. Well, he saved money in a long way. I picked a lot of good ones here. I bad money man is by still went home a winner. Thanks to Peter Ren. Peter, the 90. Peter Ren and Kevin Wallace got bless America for them. Uh-huh. All right, Neil, I'll continue. Okay. Thank you. I see you. I've got a great season. You're stay dead. What the hell are you? No, about football. And how could I? I'm so tired of these people who try to suck around on the air because they think it ingratiate themselves with the audience. You know, you don't like football. You don't care about sports. You and your bird brain friend from Lakeland. And you were entitled to that. You're entitled. I mean, there's a bunch of losers that don't care about sports. Did you hear about sunny fun? And I've lost seven pounds and five days, which I noticed you haven't said a word about. And I can already feel it. And look at it. I can even see it. I feel like that. I want to see your belt. Do you hear about sunny. Why? You hear about sunny. Oh, have a belt. Sunny fox is old news. I'm not going to imagine. I'm going to tell you if they don't give me a new mic. I'm going to, I mean, it's bad enough. We don't have the triple cart deck up here that we need so desperately. So do we don't have to play carts from off on a floor here? Don't you think it's time we got some stuff in here that works? That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. Well, then do it. Don't talk about it. I'm sorry. What happened to jerk before work? Gone. History? Yeah. Why? Do you think he was a great broadcaster? He's a good guy. He's a crab. Good voice. He's a good person. He kind of like some other people. I know. Ha ha ha ha. On the coast. Maybe jerk before work can be on the coast. There you go. I got to be honest with you. The Ron St. John does such a good job on the, to, no listen to me. At JRS in the dolphin games. But on the air. He's, well, he, well, where does that come from? It's like somebody's got a little, a bunch of fireflies under his butt or something when he's on the air. Yes. At the stadium, he does a very nice job. Maybe he doesn't use headphones at the stadium. Well, I don't know what it is. But boy, he is really growl. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. He's a good boy. Yeah. Here's all the hits all the time. Ooh, yeah. God, spastic. How do you think the dollar's feeling about, uh, a cycle lag? Falsai. Yeah. Get out the razor blades. Hmm. Leave the gun. Bring the gun, holy. Ha ha ha ha ha. Greg, baby. I mean, he's down to a one nine. What's going to happen now? Dallas is in the future for, uh, B.D.
