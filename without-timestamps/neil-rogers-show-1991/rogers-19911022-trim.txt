We're getting southern Bell and Vald and when you got Sheriff Nick lurking in a background and when Joseph Gackie and his lackeys are working sabotage at the phone company, what are we going to do?

I just have one thing. I'll tell you about the bathroom. Huh? Um. Food there running back to coach. Do you know what it's often? The running back coach. It beats me. I just moved on here from New York in the last few games. It's a dolphin plate. Same Smith jumping over to top of one hand. What I'm talking about with two hands. Right. It's just amazing. Yeah, it is amazing. That's what Shula said in the locker room after he said he must have told Tony Nathan. That's right. He said he must have had two hands on a ball. And then one of the coaches wasn't told. And one of the coaches said, no, he didn't. And Shula just said he spit eating, uh, look on his face. No way. You can jump at the end of all the ball. Of course not. And even Higgs was talking about the way how he leaps sideways to make sure he's got the better angle. And he's got both hands on a ball. And, uh, you know, Sammy just goes in and with a loaf of bread. And they're looking for it. It's the only chance they got to stop it. Knock it out of his hands and bingo. We do it again. I don't know if he's too excited to get in or what? Wasn't thinking? No, never should have happened. It should never have happened. But, uh, he see those Toronto Maple Leafs again. So it's not far. Yeah, they're great. Uh. Why was it on? Yeah. Well, I didn't see that. Thank God. Didn't see it. Yeah. And closing the Rangers. Okay. Right. One 25 at WIOD don't forget Sports Channel has come to continental cable, which gives a lot of people a little more of a life. I just can't believe these. It's either these people are loyal who are here today or have no life at all. These people have been here. Is there are there people who have been here since 10 o'clock? Look at that. There's like a whole bunch of hands of people who have been here since way back at 10. I can't get over it. You know, life. I mean, talk about loyalty. Talk about just waiting for something exciting to happen. I got news for you. And the last part, it ain't. But, for us is still there. She's a celebrity now or daughter was on the phone. It's, uh, you know how that gets in week. They'll both be chronic. They'll be like Bonnie and Sandy. Miami. Hello. Hello. I want to talk about the dolphins. Wayne is the a sur. Um, do you think Sammy sucks? Do I think so? Yeah. You want an honest answer? Yeah. Yes. Yeah. Why do you thought? Okay. Thank you, sir. I take it as a great compliment. 126 to Wild. Oh, geez. He said I suck on no. With my mother is listening. I mean, that's, uh, the same mentality. Okay. I mean, you're either going to butcher up and take it like a real man or, but make believe what are you just going to be a whimp like, Cassami? Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood. Oh, no. Yes, sir. Hey, first time caller. Great. I think you're a great. Uh-huh. And what is it you want? Huh? What is it you want? Nobody sucks your mind like that without a warning. I'm not leaving. I'm moving. Where you going? That's a sister. Oh, boy. And, uh, in a mess, yeah. Uh-huh. And I'm glad you're going out there just in time that Alex Bennett got came out there, so you won't have to worry about him. All right. But who else is it to listen to? I don't know about him. Nobody. No, but it. And I'm just happy to get out of Florida and Miami and all the carcasses and all are down here. Take a lot of tapes with you, sir. Very, hey, I'd like to call somebody to do spare. Okay. Nick and Voral first of all. Yes, sir. He's right here. He already said you're in number one. He said, uh, you better get out of town fast. And come to the top down to the adult bookstore. Okay. And he said he's got a good selection at home for you. If you don't find what you're looking for. I'm sure he does. Yeah. And two more people, throw them her Z or pick a needle to spare. Okay. Have a great life. It's a great. Okay. And don't drop the soap. Okay. Did you buy the way? Is anybody selling two live crew here at the, uh, Swapshop? Wouldn't that be great? We could have a live on the air busted. It could be better than channel seven. We could get Rick to come over here and squat over a Sheriff Nick's head. Man, we could have a big on here thing and save this damn show today. Uh, mobile in T largo. No, no. Are you doing the old grade? I just want to comment on the post game show. Yes. Like him was talking about the fact that one guy put a towel over his head. The other guys that don't put Sammy in. As far as I'm concerned, they were saying the same thing as the fans. Right. Exactly. Exactly. Except the fans don't have any way to voice this all except in the stadium. But how come when we sat in all of a sudden were bad guys and we suck and we shouldn't come back if we want to criticize. I still can't get over that. I never heard a such a thing in my life. It would be like it. It would be like if I had a restaurant, okay? And you came in and you had what you considered was a bad meal. And you called the waitress. You said I'm going to send this back. I said to you, I said if you're going to complain, don't ever come back here again. Would anybody ever say that? That's right. Unless they were out of their mind. You know, somebody like me have only been saying, I'm holding this. I can hold this when he went here. Yeah. I can't that give those a chance to say something. You bet. Have a great face. Terrible phone. John Feinberg and Atlanta. Yes, John. Are you doing great? I call them my portable. A wallet. You're sending a lot of clear early in the show. Yeah. I heard the show. How'd you hear the show? Well, I call them 800 number and they'll be ever. Oh, I see. Nobody ever picked it up. No. Well, he was busy trying to say this job. But it sounds great. Good. I listened to the whole show. This house gone crazy. Yeah, bet they are. These people are wild. By the way, you better. It's 130 already. And Ronnie get is still sitting here in the first row. And I got news. We better get that plane in the air. You guys going to be in big trouble. All we had to collect a lot of runners in scoring position. I didn't want to dump on your Ronnie. But I got news for you know that foul pop fly. With the runners in person 30. And a nice shameful. I agree. A disgrace in the top of the eighth Ronnie. I'm surprised you're not coming here tonight. What do you mean by that? I got a work for a living. Okay. I can't just flew to round like some kind of butterfly. Well, I'm not independently wealthy like Preston hand. The Preston give me a big bag of money. I'd be up there in a couple of hours. No problem. I'll think about you tonight when I'm doing the chop up. Okay. Go brave. Okay. And screw those Indians. Hey. One thing they want to trade Sammy Smith for 10. You're a tire up here. Yeah. We'll pack a sandwich. You can have both of them. All right. 130 a WIOD. And let's I don't even know what we're doing anymore. I'm just I'm doing it on like on automatic pilot. I could be here like midnight now. Would make any difference. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Good afternoon. Yes sir. Yes sir. Let me ask you a question. Are we making a little come back now? You're doing great. Okay. I like to make quick on that about camera Marshall. Yes sir. Okay. He's out of this world. Oh yeah. That's true. Last night on his on his sports cast. He just went on and on about Sammy Smith. And just how how the fans and how it's just to game and how it got out of hand. And this closing time and was for all those fans of bootam. Get a life. Oh no. Not only is he still a my material. But it is just a game. But the people who go out there got a right to complain in Beliec. If they're paying her 26 or 28 bucks don't they? That's right. And I just want to how many more times have you been able to think about it before we following a rid of him? Probably as many times as it takes for Don Shulers to convince himself that he can't get the job done. And heaven helped us before you know how long we figured that's going to be. I don't know. Hopefully something will happen. Can I ask you a question. How come like when marino makes a real bad play at a crucial time in a game or has a bad game? And he's had several this year. Marino says it was my fault. I can't play anybody else. I have to take responsibility. I didn't get the job done. He's the one of the few stand-up guys on the team. It wasn't right to blame on him. But when Shuler makes a call like that and he sends in a guy who you know he's going to fumble the ball. He doesn't say it was my fault. I call the place as well. We just got to put this behind us. Yadiyada. Yadiyada. How come he never takes a blame for it? You're right about that. I mean you can't just keep hitting Kudos and credit for those previous 300 wins. We like to have a few more before we die. You know? My right? That's true. Yeah. Have a great day. Thank you. I want to get excited about this again today. Is the last day for any of this. Okay? It's part of any in temperate bashing or crap. You're tired of hearing about this? Too bad. Okay. 130 to a hell. You got it in your system. You have to went and out, let it out. Am I right? Even the non-slamming lady said, Put a lid on already. Did you say that? Since Pat Peterson left the show. She has been such a wreck man. She just can't control herself. It's been so long. The show has been out. I remember what it's about anymore. 130. What is it? You did what? Did I sit up here? I let you take your picture and let you humiliate and degrade and make a circus up here. Did I not subject myself to all this fall to roll? And now you're still hot in the United Kingdom. Just relax. Okay? 40,000 years from now. Nobody had given crap about any of this. Okay? Right. So just relax and have another beer. 133 at WIOD. Mobile in Miami. Hello. Are you there? A mobile? Yeah. Who's about to speak? I can't believe it. There's a song coming to the end of this thing. Yes sir. Yes it's working. Okay. Well first of all, I just find it so amazing that they have Tony Nation as the running back coach because that guy was notorious for fumbling when he played. Well at least he's a good teacher. Oh man, it's the most incredible thing. And all thought I'm finally glad that everybody's taking man-ditch and the gacky to task for this because they've been doing it all season long just ripping all the fans. And I'm finally glad that that asshole is getting his... There's a difference between ripping front running phonys who don't show up unless you got a winner. I mean that's legitimate. I've been doing that for years and I stand by that. But to rip the people who do show up and the people the thousands of us including me who left early before that little episode happened and to start painting everybody with a big brush and a fan socket and to try to turn it around. That's a pile of crap. And I am embarrassed and nauseated for those people who listen and call into this radio station who call into suck around to agree every time those guys get out and say that crap because it's a bunch of garbage. It is. I mean when Sammy dropped the ball and they recorded and they called it. I immediately got my son we stood up and we just walked out. So discuss it to hang out anymore. So I didn't really hear the episode. Well we stayed that rich and I were there just blowing our brains out. We stayed I mean you know hoping we get to ball back one more time. Houston started that series. They made the first down. It was less than two minutes ago. We had no time. And at that point you know we're not getting to ball back. We left. So whatever whatever the episode that happened was right at the very end. Thousands and thousands of people including me were out of the stadium. But because we were there that day all of a sudden we're guilty by association and we suck. And the thing is that we're really pissed me off as that he would let these jerks that come from other towns like Philadelphia, Chicago or whatnot. And ripped the fans that were there. We're voicing their own opinions. Yeah. Like he would just let them go on at nausea and these assholes that come here from wherever else they come from. I'd like to hear. I'd like to hear. I'd like to hear Manichon's a gacky talk about what would the reaction to been to Sammy's second straight fumble in the end zone. If the game were played in Philadelphia. If he was on the Eagles or if the game were played in the middlelands. And then he would have done a giant to the jet. What kind of reaction would he have had then? He wouldn't have came out alive. Well, and he'll have a good win. Keep your blood pressure down. See ya. 135. That W.Y.O.D. You know, a lady in Miami purchased a red 1990 Honda Accord for what she thought was a pretty good price. The odometer on the car said only 8400 miles. But surprised when she got the car home and looked in the glove box. She found any missions test print out from June that reported the cars mileage to really be. 34,000 miles. It's more than 25,000 miles more than she thought. And that was four months ago. In a panic, she called our friends at 240 at W.Y.O.D. Okay, we're going to have another cheer from this crowd. We still have almost every seat here is still. I can't believe it. So, not that kind of a cheer. Not that kind of a cheer. At the count of three, I want Neil sucks. Okay. Because I want to prove that I can handle it. I'm going to leave here. I may have a few tears running down my cheeks. Guys still do it in a chop. And he's still chopping it. Well, it's a good thing you don't have a pastrami over there. So, we can have some good sandwiches. What is it? Why? You know that snapple you brought was delicious, but it's starting to back up just a little bit. Okay. Here we go. Glenn. Calm down. One, two, three. I want to trade. 140, I want to be traded to QAM, so I can work with some real sports people like my fault friend Eddie Kaplan. There's a great guy. 20 bad handicabber, but a good guy. 19 till 2 at WIOD. Now let's give the snapple away here because these people are holding a hope out above hope that they might get their name called. Our Lean is still folgula boca. We got 74 packs of snapple. We're never going to get to this. Okay, because most of these people are going, how are we going to do this? Where's Adam? Adam is over there. Hock it and try it. Let's give the snapple away. Okay. I'll let you use your own discretion so they can blame you. Just wander around, find some people back there that look desperate, that have a one that looked like they're really needy, that love snapple that maybe want to make a date with you and I'll come and watch. Okay, we'll take care of that. That means that's it. Okay, we did everything. We give away everything that we had and how Lua and thank God for that. Let's take a few more calls. By the way, I heard that promo. Did you notice who was on that promo and the last break who shined us on the one day when we desperately needed them the most? Well, we could have used their assistance. Well, we have it all kinds of technical problems and I was ready to pass out. We're sitting where shits it over here. Rick and Suds, you'll notice shined today. Not that I want to turn you over or anything like that or that I want anybody to call and attack them for being douchebags and turncoats. Rick and Suds, total shined today. I can't believe that. Now trust me when I tell you. Okay. Oh. Oh. Oh, oh. We're rubbing my eyes. Rick and Suds, ladies and gentlemen, shine artists, didn't show up. And Suds, by the way, is on the phone from the house. Not from the studio. I got news for it. If I were you. Well, we didn't want to show up because we were afraid they'd be fighting you guys. If I'd have been you guys, I'd have stayed away from here today too. Yeah. They'll do it. We're going to invite it. What if they started saying we suck? We decided we were going to call you. Okay. On three, Rick and Suds suck. One, two, three. Yeah. They said it like they meant it. Two couple of people said it two or three times. Well, sure. Moms are there. Why? We could have used you here today. I want to tell you. This is the mother. Of course, considering it is my last remote broadcast ever. I, you know, it's no, I don't know what you're laughing about. That's the MS. Okay. That is the living truth. My show is out of the studio. We got the cards, the phone. It's comfortable. Everything. I was on my way. And then I heard what was going on. I turned around immediately. Chicken, total color. You got it. Yep. You're turning into another. The ganky lacky. You probably didn't have the courage. Okay. Let's keep in mind. We're on the radio here. You guys probably had a face. And six o'clock didn't have the courage. No, they were out there. No, I'm talking about tonight. Oh, well, well, the show ends at five. Fifty. Now let me ask you a question. Since you have a sheet and I don't. Yeah. Who's doing sports talk tonight? Football talk? Should we talk? Who's doing it tonight? I don't have a sheet. Not yet. It's not so good. Oh, here we have a sheet. Okay. We have a check our sheet. It's Joe and Sunny. Oh, yeah. With Jerry Cashman baseball composer. Or poser. We're talking baseball. Well, that's the way to sweep it on the carpet in it. And then Hank has says no game due to World Series. Yeah. What does that mean? That means that Hank is. That's exactly what it says. Hank is hanging out somewhere. Yeah. It's solid. No game due to World Series. This is no game due to World Series. No. Exactly. Well, they must have watched the first two in Minnesota. I can't even speak anymore. Well, hey, then we got to go. Now, wait a minute. Wouldn't you guys like to start a few minutes early? Because you probably got a lot of material. I was your Rick said, have all this stuff here and I'll never get to it. Maybe today could be the day you get to all of it. And then some. Just be quiet. And you might even be able to play some of the cars on a rack. So one and two if you play your car and you're right. Okay. Let's do the show. Yeah. Drive home. Oh, by the way. So what happened with this? Okay. Wait a minute. We got a big crowd here. Hold on. We don't have to do this by phone call. Everybody that wants the old Rick and Suds opening theme back. Hands.

Neil, how you doing? Pretty good. Yeah. How come the announcers in the play is down here? They don't realize don't when you pay your money. You have certain rights. Because there are a bunch of shills sir. They're shills. They're cover up artists. They suck around together. They sleep together. They have an incestuous relationship. And they can't tell it like it is. How's that for now? That's a good analogy. I'll give you any of our caro used to get food for 20 dollars a ride. It's three to five when he dumped on a favorite. Right. And I was one of them. Hey, let me. But the rent is to take this. Yeah, I was thinking about that yesterday. At the race track, the railbirds and people like go down and stand right by the rail. Yeah. I have an occasion in the summertime when it's an ice day. You go down and stand by the rail. They come out for the post parade. Right. And the fans are like five feet away. I mean, they're that's a captive audience. And I remember one time at Yonkers, I'm standing by the rail. And Carmine Abbott-Tolo comes out from the post parade. And there's like a whole bunch of these nearer. Come on, you suck. And I mean, there's screaming. And guess what? He goes in there when he does his business in the next race. Whatever he's got planned. You know how that goes. And life goes on and that goes with the territory. And he doesn't cry and say, I'm taking it. I'm going to free hold. I'm not putting up with the city. It's a red mile. Exactly. It's part of the territory. Of course. And these guys are making big money. And to listen to Hank and all these owners are ghetto and Tony and Jim, this is shameful and how could anyone person take the abuse? What kind of crap is that? We all get it if you're in a public limelight. You take a lot of crap. But if you get paid well for it, then you just the smile all the way to the back. They've made a hell of a shemmy going to go to the things he won't be boo. Yeah. Good luck to him. Take care. See you. Excellent call.
