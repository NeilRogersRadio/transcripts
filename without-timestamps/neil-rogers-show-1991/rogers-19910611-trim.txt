Now here's Neil Rogers, a new dog radio 610 WIOD. For Bury, we're not home right now. We thank you for your call. We are such very people. We love you one and all. Please leave an amen phone number. We'll call you back with luck. But if you should hang up to soon go take a fly. I am here, I am here. What is now? What? That's true. That's true. Three, three, three, two, one. Now we're home right now. Holy cow. Now it's an old Eskimo tricker of how to catch a polar bear. Now what you do is you go cut a hole in the ice, right? And then you take little peas in the place and strategically, four inches apart all the way around the hole, right? And a polar bear will crawl up and he'll look at it in very much curiosity as what is going on there. Now what he bends over to take a beat, you kick him in the ice hole. 10 17 at W. I. O. D. We got a mobile in Miami. How you doing Neil? Great. Big league baseball football basketball big league down now. And hockey right on the horizon maybe we hope we pray who knows. I hope to Neil, I'd love to see you did anything now. No chance. Why not? Why not? I mean it's fun to talk about it, but if even if the station gets the game, there's no out-be given no consideration to do it. There's not a chance in a million. Let me ask you a question. I'm too controversial too many potty mouth words. All another crap. No, I'm serious. They don't want people like that involved in baseball. They really don't. Answer a question for me because this is your profession. How do they go about taking people to that? Do they do auditions? Do you submit tapes? How would that? How does that happen? Oh yeah. They do auditions. People send in jillions of tapes. And whoever is the biggest jack, of course. They have to have like two jacks on a broadcast. Of course you do understand there would be television and radio. Right. And probably not the same people necessarily. I mean you can go to the bank channel 7. I'll get to TV because they're the only major independent station in the market. Right. And they've been just waiting for this day. Well, you're right. Because when you listen to the anchor games, the people will do the radio. Not to people will do the on TV. Right. Well, there are some exceptions. I mean like Harry does three things on radio and shakago, but generally you're talking different people. Well, I haven't talked to you a few months because there's really not much for me to call in for. I do want to say it all, you know, seriously that the first time I ever heard you or heard your voice was when you're doing the UM games. I was impressed very much then. And I think anybody that heard you years ago doing those games. And I feel this is the truth that it was the best baseball now, I had ever heard and I was in May. No further fucking funny. I say there at no question about it. No, it's true. And I remember very clearly that you used to do this thing with two outs of the guy I'm not decked circle. You'd say he would be next. Well, I stole that from Harry. Yeah, but it was great. And it's a shame because I think you'd be just perfect with job. I know you'd love to do it. Yeah. I mean, you're really winning at this. But there's no chance. I'm not going to get myself all wound up about it because there is no chance. Well, I say right now. I was going to do that one hurricane game with Hank. And we could even do one Lousy hurricane game. And I did those games for six years. Well, you had those tight, you know, what's over the university? Miami. That's a whole different ball game. I mean, you know, this is different. And I want to say right now, I want to start to give Neil a chance. Program. Yeah. Give Neil a chance. Really? Yeah. How about it? We start. Dream on series. Eros Smith would say. Dream on. Give Neil a chance. Okay. Okay. Let's start a big ride in Camp. I'm curious. Okay. You, you, you, you see people heard you only. When you're the university, I'm going to say the same thing. If it's on mayor and alone, you got to get the job. Yeah, but nothing is on me. If it was on mayor and alone, Ralph Kiner and Fran Healy and the Lagrangna Ranch wouldn't be doing the Metz games. Well, and Bob Murphy who's been dead for 20 years. Well, you know, sports brought casting it on mirrored anymore. Most of the guys who get in are like ex-Jox. Yeah. In fact, there are some cities where all the announcers are ex-Jox, which is really pathetic. Well, do you have any of your old tapes from the University of Miami days? Yeah. I love the year. I've got every one of them. I'd love to hear someone. Would you? You just come here. You just go, you just go, you just go. He could have written a letter home before he tagged him out of me. Just dropped the ball right on the back. Yeah. Well, that was exciting, wasn't it? Well, hey, I'm telling you that's far part of getting excited about it in the radio. That's right. Well, that's how you build sports casting. I make a big deal out of it because when I was a kid growing up, I was like had a fetish, listening to Bob Prince and Mel Allen, a red barber and hairy and all the great ones. But now, mostly, what you got or a bunch of Jox who are semi-illiterate and in our articulate and second, like Maccarv, Rolly Woods, I sit there in second guest every pitch. I mean, it's boring. Well, it's not exciting. People upstairs feel that the people out there are getting more from it, which is ridiculous because people listen to baseball and the radio, no baseball. Yeah. And I think the University of London Games and Lee Rolly, go home listen to radio because I enjoyed it as much in the radio. Kevin, have a chance. Okay. Goodbye. Thank you. Well, I made your league suckin' around there. 21 after 10 in WIOD, we have one open line. It's in Dave County, 751, Go Marlins. It's almost unbelievable, isn't it? That anything good could happen in this God forsaken place. It's like a miracle. And I told you this week's ago. Man, and he was just talking about his, just flabby his gums. I told you this was a done deal, Miami and Denver. Score tied, 3-3 in the bottom of the 17th. One ball and one strike. Booms in the wind up in the one one pitch. Swan on, in the deep right field. You can't kiss it, goodbye. Oh, baby, did he get that baby out of sight? He created it. Reballged two strikes. There's a try. If the wind does the home it out, it'll be gone. We're here. Holy cow. Okay, come down. Harry, 10-25 in WIOD, let's go to North Miami Beach. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir. I just got back from Houston, my hometown. I went in there just to watch the Met series this weekend. Nice game last night. It was great. Why didn't you see the one last night? That's all the first two that we blew in the night, didn't you? You realize Houston could have swept the whole series. Oh, yeah, very easily. The seven walks in the night, ending in one game and to gave away the other one too. I mean, I can't complain about the ester as bullpen because they don't have any. That's right. The only headman relief pitcher in a, uh, let him go and we got him in Chicago. Of course, we don't have any chance to bring him any more because we're never close enough. Later in the game. Well, I think played the world other exciting. I'll tell you this. Steve Finley, maybe maybe the next Andy van Slyck. I mean, that kid played the outfit with breakfast with Bandy's in two 89 now. Really come on. My Craig B's Yo's okay, my book. There you go. Next to God, almost. Yeah. I don't know what right. I was in a, I was in the gallery down there. And I was walking by with Dungell's door. And I thought about my favorite talk show host. And I went in there and I bought you a few Mcernedos cigars. Oh, listen to this. You went out with John and Badwin. Listen to this. I was ripping the cigars that I'll go to the incentive day. So this morning, I get another package from New York FedEx, no less. And I opened it up. And it's a whole bunch of white owl and these cheap, day, no police cigars. And a note in it from Alex is, this is more your speed. Cheap pathetic rejects from George Burns. Well, anyway, I just, I went in there and I got him for you. And I got a couple for you and one for George. And I'll get him to you when I can. I don't know when I can get over there. I was going to try to get him to see it at Miracle Game, but I'm going to be working late tonight. So anyway, I thought you think you might enjoy him and I'll get him to see you as a camera. You're a great American. Thanks. 1027 and WIOD. We have open line of dates. 7.5. One, let's go to Miami. Hello. How you doing? Okay. A good idea. Yeah. Harry Carrey and Neil Rogers calling for the Miami, New York. Yeah, right. You just played that short part of when you were calling one of the games. I'm not a real big baseball fan, but you sounded very good. So it winds up as a double steel. Shield is 33 to far his third and no further fucking. Okay. You sounded great. You sounded great. I was taking a consideration. I am the best. Yes. And let me ask you something. I have another question. I don't know. Before I go. I'll be honest with me. Would you prefer calling baseball games or doing what you're doing now? How long do I have to think about that? Well, by 11 o'clock. I can give you an answer to about six seconds. So what's the answer? Baseball. Not even close. All right. Also. See, if this were different kind of time, I mean, like after days like yesterday, did you listen to this show yesterday? Well, everybody else was working yesterday too. I wouldn't wish that show yesterday on Billy Martin. Okay, or anybody. I mean, it was just the most every Monday in this town is like talking into a vacuum tube. I could have a more intelligent conversation with my dogs and often do then I have a Mondays here. Normally, I listened to you lunch. Yesterday for some reason. I couldn't. It was raining outside. I couldn't. Yeah. Before I go out this weekend, I'm going to New Orleans. Have you ever been there? Oh, don't do it. What a smart me crappy place. That while I heard it smells this time of the year. Do you like, are you a big drinker? Uh, Johnny Walker Red. No, I'm not asking you what you drink, but I mean, are you a big booze sound? If you are, you're love New Orleans. If you're not a drunk, there's nothing to do there. It's a crappy town. Well, what I was trying to do is see if, by any chance, you've gone there to eat. If you could recommend anything. No, because I haven't been eating for the last year or so. I'm going there for the, that sounds funny. Doesn't have been eating. I mean, I have been eating in restaurants. Yeah, the food there is great. Well, if you want to eat, you want to drink that to place to do it. Oh, okay. I'm working at this. Just as long as you don't go outside. Just as long as you don't walk around. What a, oh, crazy, smart me dumb place that is. I mean, I don't go there. He says it smells about this time of the year. Yeah, don't walk alone. Yeah, from February through in November, it's things pretty bad there. He says don't walk alone. I can think that's the best advice he ever gave you. Don't walk alone. Really? If I just stay in a hotel, maybe they got good room service. Well, we're supposed to have a party Saturday night at Hogs Head Saloon. That's New Orleans. All right, Hogs Head Saloon. All right. Yeah. You got it. I hope to hear you announcing for the Miami Facebook team soon. Okay. Don't walk alone. Bye bye. See you. We should play and you'll never walk alone by a Tony Benner's somebody. Oh, what a horrible city that is. There's an open line of dates. 751 mung. 751 Wiod. D4 Lodderdale. Hey, how are you doing? Great. I just got a couple requests for Wayne Hizzong. Have you listened to me? Yes, sir. Number one. Please name the team after Miami and not South Florida. Yeah, it's Miami, Marlins. Yeah. Well, I don't even like, I don't like Marlins. Well, listen. I mean, it's better than the Panthers. It's better than anything else that they've been tossing around. Definitely definitely. I like to make those myself. Might be make those out of pretty good. The one? Miami, make those, make those sharks? Maco's? Yeah. They were in a make-o? Yeah, but that's pretty weak. Pretty borderline. You know, like on the edge. Well, Marlins is often too close to me. And, uh, Miami definitely South Florida and even after a region is, I don't think I don't cut it. And the other request is, please do not give it to colors after the ballfines. Give it to another color. Come on with something new. The dolphins have a weak color and I don't think it's, yeah. How about mungerun with purple polka dots? Yeah. I actually was thinking, well, they've taken out to the, uh, seminal four-day seminal color. Oh, they got ugly uniform. Starting going like that. Yeah. They got ugly. I mean, the colors may be okay, but their uniforms are really ugly. Oh, yeah. They have a couple of ones. They got a couple of nice and same with Miami or hurricane. Bad uniforms, couple of nice ones. No, they don't have bad uniforms. Hercanes? They got, they got a couple of goings like, uh, the, um, the way uniform the gray ones. That says Miami process nice and the white one that says hurricane the process. Yeah. The one with the orange shirt. Oh, no. I agree with those are gross. There's like something Charlie Finley would come up with. Yeah. Double for a request that's maybe way into this and think about. Okay. Thank you. See ya. We love you Wayne. Not Wayne Arnold. Well, we love him too. By the way, he was in here with some more cigars this morning. Some good ones. It ones we like since we're very choosy. And when they're free, we want him to be good. And, uh, he lost 23 pounds Wayne Arnold. How do you like that? Because I jumped all over his case and I talked about what a fat slobby had become. I couldn't tell. And he got hysterical. You can't tell? You're still looking pretty damn fat to me Wayne. Cut it out. There's a lady in Miami. Hello. She's gone. Oh, there you are. Boy, I was in the hole. Well, that's close enough. Hello. Yes, ma'am. I happen to be a long time listener and a first time that I managed to get through to you. Wow. I wonder if you know how popular you are as far as being the one to broadcast the game. Well, I think I'm in. I think it's a lock. Well, I'm very, very thinking of a right in campaign. But I mean, I really don't even know which station has got to get it. Suppose WINZ gets the right to the games. Of course, if channel 7 gets the TV rights, I'm right next door here to channel 7. They're my best buddies over there. Oh, I know they must love you because you're very kind. I have a Sally and Penny. They're my buddies over there. No, I'm really serious. So if you listen to Hank last night or you caught any part of this show, you'd be surprised how many people called in. Not sucking up for you. But really just suggest you doing the color. I only heard a couple of minutes of Hank last night in the car. And somebody was suggesting that he should do the games with Bob Costa. And of course, Bob Costa gets the game. I will personally go over there and shoot him because he's the biggest twerp that ever said foot on the face of their cost is an interest in doing games. He just wants to make himself the focal point just like during the NBA, him and what's his name or doing all these stupid things shooting baskets. Nobody cares about whether Bob Costa is shooting baskets. You know, it's a cat ride ride. Yeah. But you're crap. You're right. People want to see they see it always bothers me when he's ex-jocks or little twerps like costus who isn't even next. When they want to focus the attention on themselves rather than the game. That's the big mistake they make. Nobody gives it to him about Bob Costa's. You're right. I'm a real sports fanatic and I cannot thank you enough for all the hours of pleasure you gave me when you broadcast the QM based book. Well, that's when those hurricane broadcast were exciting if I do say so myself. They really were. Yeah. And you're being excited to do as a wacky. No, really, the fact that you are so controversial, I think, is a plus. I think it'll draw twice as many listeners. Well, we don't want somebody who's boring in terminal. We want somebody who will make it exciting and lively and, you know, even if it is boring. I'll make it this way. No, that's why we want your rockets. Right. Okay. I'm ready. My bags are packed. Okay. Incredible. That's what I said. The NPOD and one-o-pet chin side almost did rollin' with that one. It's two-and-o and lighter. HAPPENING'S CONFOLLE. Those are the crowd. It's not happy. What it, I guess it sounds like I'm campaigning for it. There's not a chance it's going to happen. No chance. So I don't want people to think I'm on here here campaigning to get the job. We don't even, I mean, it's not even to done deal yet. The owners have to approve the cities and then there will be a frantic bidding war and see the thing with the station is because WSB and Atlanta, one of our sister stations owned by the Koch sisters, uh, here's the braves and has had for years. And evidently, either loses or doesn't make any money on it. Well, that's their problem. Okay. I can't help it that they're stupid up there. That's not my problem. So they're not real enthused about getting baseball. Here from what I understand that's the rumor. I could be wrong. Hopefully. I'm wrong. There's Lady in town. She's at orthodox Jew. As she needs to buy bread that is unleavened. But his legs and she knows that the stores are all closed. As you really. It's too late. A side with. And she's buying bread seven. He's in. When the bread is wonderful. 10.50. Fucking here. River really got a feel of very embarrassed on that one. As he had the ball waiting for car car was even. He wasn't sliding, conceiting, being out and revert dropped it right of the bag. Drop this. Okay. We have an open line in Palm Beach 655 Wiod. Croll Springs. I hear a deadly silence on that line. Don't you? That is the deadest sounding line. Is there somebody on it? Oh, listen to that. Oh. Yes, sir. You there? We catch you a little short. Deal. Yeah. I'm sorry. There's a customer came here and walked out of that chance. Hey, listen, the way things are now. Don't pass up any customers. I believe me. I'm not that. That was ignorant. But I was fine. That's okay. Timing was great. Hey, Neil. You have to stay in there for yourself. Now you're. Right. I want it. And I want it now. Well, say you want it. Make everybody make sure you want it. I do want it. I don't know for the second. Yeah, I want it. Don't win. I've been saying I wanted for years. And I've never accomplished much. I mean, this might be the last. The raw you have before your. You know before I go to that big talk show booth in the sky. That's right. This is it. I want it. This station. Let me say it right now. Let me put it right on the table. If this station gets Major League Baseball. And I'm not included as one of the answers. I'm walking. But don't write down stairs to get my check on the way out. So I can come back the next morning. Don't sit back. Do all this yelling stuff like you. Do yell about it and complain and make them. But we don't even have the thing yet. Don't you understand? No. Because it's a matter of start whining now. Then you'll get the point. Yeah, that's right. And the colors. They're going to definitely be the same as Dolphin. Yeah, they're going to be a variation on the same team. I don't see anything wrong with that because it's kind of fits in with the stadium. Why? You see, you got all these people who are just belly-y. You can, well, the colors are going to be right. We don't like the teams name. I don't even know for sure what it is. You have to see that bothers. No, this should be the most exciting week. One of the most exciting moments in the history of this entire God for sake. And Yahoo Town. And we still got all these people out. It should be this. It should be that. The colors should be pink with yellow polka dots. Who cares? As long as we got it, right? The stadium is great. The stadium is the best. It is state of the yard. It's comfortable. It's beautiful. It's magnificent. It's impeccable. It's in a great location. You drive right. I mean, I've heard of drive through fast food places. But whoever heard of a drive through stadium. It drive right in there. I live in Carl Spain. This is piece of cake. Exactly. And it is so nice. I mean, you come in from three river stadium. And Pittsburgh. That was a pink and it's not a syrup. This is like, and this is, this is great. You may have a betterness. Okay. All right. I wanted syrup. Okay. And I want it now. We arrived. Okay. We have to the bowl game. We have to the ground. Five is on me. I say, crack. I don't care if my ever get back to the rest of the food. Who put our home team? We know when it's a shame. So it's one, two, three sessions out of the old days. You can't hear me. I'm the guy you love the rip on. I'm on my own. Scalimet. Car at third. Shields at second. Nobody out in field. Drawing way in. Here's the stretch. And a two-odd around a swing. And a fly ball. Well hit the left. He's going back at the fence. And it is. The whole week. All. 1115 at WIOD. Let's go to Hollywood. Hey, Neil Woodenball is baseball, silver. Yeah. You sound pretty excited about it. It's great. Yeah. Speaking of baseball. Tape. That's one four year. What do you do with an elephant with three balls? Send him to Ripley, I guess. 1115 at WIOD. Throw another one high and outside. We have an open line at Broward 5249463. Open Lockup. I'm mad at sale. And you're not going to take it anymore. I don't blame you. Stop. You're going to get a little while to go to Spaniards discovered American. There were people living here when he showed up. While he did was introduced plague, pestilence, et cetera. I bet you he's never even been in Columbus. Well, yeah. I just, I think it makes me crazy when I hear that the Spaniards. Oh, listen. Sir, all this ethnic crap. I mean, forget about it. Okay. Baseball. There will be everybody. There will be angloes and cubans and blacks and whites and grander cripples. They'll be using gulluminer. There will be all kinds of people. Young and olden and between haven't a great time. Can hardly wait. We need to monochempane to get you on those announcer. Yes, sir. And Richard is a douchebag. And no further fucking. Have a great day, sir. Take care. Okay. 1116 on the voice of the Marlon, 610 WIOD. Let's just pretend like we already got it. Kind of a, you're a news whether traffic and Marlon's in dolphin station. And just general fish and around WIOD. They've already got that news whether in traffic up there on the Markey out in front. Let's get Dumbordo to put Marlon station up there and see if we get a little rise out of somebody. Okay. Come on, Dumbordo. We got enough letters in the thing yet. Go on out there and put it up. Could be his last act though. That's my opinion. I'm like this. We're having a great day. Everybody's in a wonderful mood. The phones are blazing. We're actually getting people with IQ bigger than their joc sighs calling in. And George tells me, and not only am I choking on a cheap cigar from Al Goldstein. George tells me that it's pouring cats and dogs again. This is getting old man. It is getting ponderous. God, every stinkin' day. And our weather people, they lie like hell. I'll tell you that this is getting so imponderous. I can't even describe it. Point and beach. Morning Neil. Is it raining by you? No, it's not. It's cloudy, but it's not raining. Well, just wait. I know it happened to me yesterday after you and I got it about three hours after you all did. You got it about three hours after we did, huh? Yeah. Well, that's interesting. Hopefully you got it early. But we wanted. A couple of things. I'm going to change the subject before I say something. I might have to admit it. Okay. Okay. First of all, the dreaded pombies post this morning. There was an article. There was a series of questions and answers about the team. Have they discovered we're getting it yet up there? Yes, we actually did it. And it made the right page too. Good work for the Netscox and his papers for. They're on top of it. And I mentioned that the team colors were probably going to be aqua white and some other as they put it warm color, whatever that is. Like puce. Right. Also that the thing about spring training that they said that high zincah has some land near the orobbys stadium that they're speculating they think you might use it. Well, you mean they would be here? Yeah. That would be incredible. This would be the only team that had spring training in the same area where they play. That would be amazing. Save them for money. Yeah. You don't do it. Wouldn't that be great? But maybe if you want to be real nice if he's got a little change left over. You can build a bigger rena for the hockey team up there and for the heat. That's right. And finally, enclosing my nominations for broadcasters, including yourself. And someone who has not been mentioned lately who will be available in that year. Yeah. You're all great. How does that sound? Very realistic. That would be tremendous. All right. Well, that's about all I have. Thank you, sir. You're great. I'm sorry. 1126 in WOD. In fact, we could, uh, one of our sponsors could be brick oven because they already have the big, uh, early in the big kneel. We have an open line in Palm Beach 655 WOD. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Welcome to the voice of the Marlins, sir. Hey. How you doing? Congratulations on your new job. Yeah. I can't wait to start. We're going to do a mock game tonight just to get practice. Hey. I'm a first time column 21. My brother got me hooked on a show about two months ago. I really enjoy it. I'm going to give my friends a listen to it. They love it. They love the cat noises. They do love it. They love it. How about the show? They love that too. They like that too. And I'm glad to see that young people listen to your show. Millions of J.ins. I'm going to show it. What are the lucky ones? Let me tell you. All this crap about the colors. Who cares? Exactly. Now, here's our kind of call. Here's the guy who's got the right altitude man. The color could be puked and fluorescent orange. I don't care. I'll still be out the go ahead. Wait a minute. Puked and fluorescent orange. That sounds pretty good. I like it myself. Yeah. How about the colors? Hey, that's not that guy with the sign. Yeah. Yeah. You keep ragging on me, huh? No. It's just part of life, sir. It's just part of whatever we're doing here. Just to go with the flow. Hey, you know, that guy that caught about the electronic sign with numbers and all that. Yeah. At least in my part of town. I know that the jerks would be racing to see who could get the biggest number on the screen. Exactly. Well, they're always comparing big numbers in that part of town. So far, they're only up to about a four, I think. No, three. Wow. Okay. So, you know, I'd want to say to keep up the good work and, you know, I'll be watching you soon on TV. Okay. Okay. All right. See ya. Okay. It's a done deal. We're doing it. Now, the question is should we rip off Harry's shoot? I do the games like Harry and Stilaula. His stuff that would be bush league, but it would be a lot of fun, though. All right. Seven-thin stretch. Can you see it? One, two, three. Only one problem I'd have to start drinking heavily, I guess. 28 after 11 at WOD Palm Beach. Look at that. Well, I'm not going to chew them out because they probably can't even hear us. Is it really raining, band again? Like a dead huge from a held George city. So, it's just coming down in buckets. I think it's stopped. Briefly. Okay. Just long enough to give you false sense of security. These weather people in this town. Did you hear the thing they did to teleport yesterday? I think it was in the morning. And one of the guys, great cause by the way. One guy was ripping a traffic patrol. It was absolutely right on target about how they got no clue what's going on. And another guy was ripping our our weather in the morning with Bob Soper that's been recorded from like six years ago on Pourham. You're right, sir. We haven't got any idea what the hell a weather is. We just have like six different cards and we play any mini money and small and pick whichever one whichever color looks good. Look at that the star line even dropped off at star IOD. I shouldn't know. We had a tremendous start and that's going to Peter off. Four Latterdale. Are you doing this? Great. What the hell's tap of they worried about this? Hey, Steven. Get in the damn hockey team. Screw them. That's right. They want everything over there. They're lucky they got like high button shoes over there. See, the toy, see now. What a bunch of greedy bastards. They're crying in your beard too bad. Screw them. You got one thing at a time here. You have one's the last time you were over there. Oh, she's such a Yahoo place. You know, it's strictly a blue collar, a knee androthal kind of what they're also going to do kind of place. What's the bear game? A bear buck game? Football. That was like eight years ago. That's stating of there is two boys. That's a real piece of work. It looks like a block of cement that somebody got out of this time. I'm going to finish it. Yeah. Anyway. What's with this three plane coverage? Where the hell are these planes when they're calling in? You know, it's okay. Had a good point there. Tampa. Tampa. Yeah. One to one. They're giving, they're giving like stuff that's going on the cross town expressway in Tampa and I-4 and 75. They don't know what's going on here. Listen, real in closing, sir. A spirey port on green alligator. He still has and crossed the finish line. And he's now down to 75. They're really their punctured guts out. All right. Take care. You too. The next one. The next one. This is the show delamagnana. The new rehearsal. This is the set up. The next one. The number is stuck. 22 till noon at WIOD where it's a rain in cats and logs. By the way, the lovely Maria Genero of a channel 6 weather is doing a weather this week because of what's his name Mark McKewain is on vacation. On CBS morning news. And she's doing a great job. I have a feeling she may not come back. She's a little bit too good for us. Two balls, two strikes, two outs. You can come one out away from their six-thin roll. Two, three. Little bit. Hey, stuck them out. That's where. That's where. They went their six-thin roll. I can't believe that. There's a drive. Where the drive to find things. It's looking. A ramps. Four, four, four. Shot the ramp. Nice. Four out of the air. Well, you know those are all from the distant past. It's $154 WIOD. Blight and beach. Where's the shame about Tampa, huh? Yeah, that's a rough break. Isn't it? I'm going to lose a lot of sleep over that this weekend. Yeah, they have their nickname, the Redneck Stick down there. The Yahoo's. Big night over there's Crystal in the ABC lounge. That's it. Think that's where your buddy from Lakeland's working now. Guy, hope so. How about a resurrecting his last day for the old people of Tampa? Oh, she's this sounds like a request to me. You know, it's there. I might could be wrong. Maybe I'm prejudging, but it sounds like it's bordering right on the edge of, you know, something I don't know where the hell it is. Wait, don't worry, sir. Huh? Wait, don't worry. Like I said, let's not get care. What is that? Did he get cut off? Good. I think somebody's punishing him. He sounded like he had a real crappy phone. He got cut off. Okay. It's $155 WIOD. We have an open line in Palm Beach, $655. And of course, we know that my good friends in the press like Bill and the boss read it to the hero and my good buddy Tom Jick at the Sun Sentinel are going to be campaigning now. Now that it looks almost definite, we got to team. They're going to be writing big articles saying, Neil Rogers and Hank should be doing those games. Get them on those broadcasts. Right, Tom? Yeah. I'm holding my breath. Be careful and do our... He's back and he's stalking a psycho who wants to make the Chicago Cubs Pented Contenders. Clint Eastwood is dirty, hairy, hairy. How everybody is hiring, curry was Steve Stone and the f***ing copster goodness f***ing beat out of them today. Clint Eastwood gives a whole of fame performance as the legendary Cubs broadcaster. There's action. The pitch! Strike at the... He's through that f***ing ball right past Clarks. Suspense. If f***ing might be... If f***ing cut me, it is off. No grind! romance. Oh, look at the Tomette Prox Steve, holy cow. Clint Eastwood is dirty, hairy, hairy, hairy. Coming to a theater near youth. 107 at W.I.O.D. We're having a little celebration here. We got baseball, we got peanuts in popcorn and cracker jacks and hot dogs and white hots. And whatever else. Okay, probably 50 million gallons of butt. Lotter day of lakes. Yeah, I knew how he'd do it. Great. I had like lots of things I wanted to tell you, but I set on horses along there forgot. I just wanted to say that I've been listening for about a week now every day. So the first time calling I wanted to call yesterday and try to list your spirits a little bit. I didn't get in because I'd do all of it. Get off work around four when you're already done. But I just wanted to say that I want to call this guy and know Greg White. He's a major douchebag. No question about it, sir. If you knew him, you'd call him a douchebag also. But also, yes, it hurt you. Call a guy named Bill Marshall. And you were describing him a little bit about, I don't know. He sounded like a real jerk. Do you know him? I know a guy named Bill Marshall. He sort of fit the description. What do you like? What do you look like? Does he work across the business? Is he a guy? That's him. Huh? That was him. You just turned. Oh, that was him. Yeah. He's nobody important like it. Because I know a guy named Bill Marshall. He's a major douchebag. Well, that's the guy. You're the kind of sending more on. Slyball. You know it. You must know the guy. Yep. You must know the guy. Why don't you listen to for a while. Hope we get baseball. That'd be a great thing. We got it. We got it. Sir, it's a lot. Go to the bank. I'd bet your life savings on it. My roommate said that he saw an article last week that it says that they were going to stop the expansion. Tell your roommate that he had Bill Marshall got a lot in common. I'm a tell him. I'll call him now. I'll do Spag. Randy your douchebag. Okay, sir. Great call. Believe me. For the first time. This was an emotional experience for both of us. I think you're right. I think you're right. Take your bite. Wow. It's getting too hot to handle. And you're all telling you that. I'm going to go with Miami in a braward line. I knew just one thing we have to let Mr. Zingan know. Yeah. No senior citizen day at the ballpark. Uh-huh. No early bird special at the ballpark. Better I do. We can have like a special section for them on the outside. And with you announcing and Wayne Arnold's hot dogs. We'll look at more could you ask. You're like dying and going to heaven. What a day. Yes, sir. Mike Webster, you're still a douchebag no matter what. Okay. Thanks. Boy, see what I mean? There's a classic example. There's a guy yesterday. First of all, he wouldn't have even bothered calling. And if he did call, he would have been all bummed out and he pressed in psychotic. He calls in today. You can just hear the excitement in his vocal cords. You can hear him just practically a feeling the change. There's an open line in the center square that of course is ring as we speak now. Boy, this is just, uh, you could knock me over with a feather duster with a Hoover. One 14. We better do this mobile. Hello. Hey, Neil. Are you doing pretty good. I listen. Yes, concerning the bird Glenn Hill. Yeah. He's going to be on the other radio stations Sunday night. Act, uh, I think about 10 o'clock or something like that. And he promises to tell all the dirty smud about you. Is it like crazy? Did you know that or not? I couldn't give a crap less. Okay. I just wonder because, you know, maybe some of your listeners could, uh, just say what they thought of him. But I probably just ignore it like most of the rest of us, well. Is there a line of dirty smud that we don't know? You're all sure about him, too. Yeah. Okay. I just didn't know what he knew or not. I couldn't give a crap less, sir. And I'm glad that Steve got you to call. Is this a celebrity call? Hello, Neil. Yeah. Do you have been to St. Louis? Have I ever been there? Yeah. Yes. Do you like St. Louis? No. I was born and raised in St. Louis. Which means the line I am not. Yeah, not St. Louis. I thought I'd start with that. I'll wait. Listen. I'm talking about baseball. It's the man with the cap ladies in gentlemen. I don't mean the Marlins cap. I was fortunate enough to grow up in a town that had two major league baseball teams. Yes, they were. They were both the same who was Browns. I mean, you know, they were not really penned winners or whole lot. They had one world series in my memory, which is 1946. I was the little kid. I was seven, eight years old, whatever. But trying to explain the relationship that develops between a community and a major league baseball team. To somebody who has never experienced that is like trying to talk about people and maybe somebody who never lived through it. You just can't do it because there's there's an emotional tie there that is just beyond words. And unlike football, which is once a week every Sunday afternoon or Monday night or whatever, this happens almost on a daily basis. And you can plug in, plug out, get involved with whatever degree you feel is appropriate. And just great. I, you know, and I think the guy who really deserves an awful lot of credit will be, obviously, if he's putting what 125 million dollars on the line. Yeah. It's all seven done. Right. And you can take 125 million bucks, put it in the bank and leave very happily forever after on the interest. So he's really sticking his neck out, eight miles. And when you look at the fact that you and a half ago, we didn't have a snowball chance in hell of having a major league baseball team. And now we're locked. It looks like it's going to happen for sure. That's a big turnaround in a pretty short time frame. Do you hear what we're concerned about, Dad? Do you hear what you doubt it? Boy, you are just worked up like a long cloud. Well, I'm, I'm thrilled. I am happy. I'm happy. I hope that everybody who has had somewhere in their background, the opportunity to share what can happen when you have a major league baseball franchise in your community is as pleased and thrilled and excited about the possibilities I am, because it's just great. It is great. Yeah. It's a best thing that's happened here since the mix. Thank you, Neil. It's mixed 105. But he don't start now. I'm not going to carry it away. Johnny, Jarkle, be in here and knock us off the ear. I know you're a big baseball fan. I was talking to Greg. You've done about it. He's a big baseball fan. I'm a big baseball fan. So I just wanted to share that with you. Thank you, Rick. Okay. Get into the hat. Never got what's here. Wow. Just wound up as tight as a drum as a snare drum, wasn't he? Man. Just on and on. That's the kind of stuff that we strive for. I know. One 18 at WIO do that was the real Ricky Tickey ladies and gentlemen. Man, just flowing it out. Of course he's not a lot of same much over there anymore or so. All these FM guys, you know, when they really have something to say, which is an often, but they come right here to do it. Cutler-ridge. Neil. Yeah. I have first I want to call myself a major douche bag. Uh-huh. Now you're going to prove it to us. Yesterday I called and you cut. I called myself off. Yeah. But first I wanted to hurt. Did it hurt? Oh man. Did it. But this bad boy club. The other day you had a caller. Want to know where the stickers were. The bad boy club. Sounds like a bunch of Yahoo's to me. What about it? What would be wrong with that's what it sounds like. Well, they're not a bunch of Yahoo's. You know, these little low riders and stuff that they go around it. Yeah, they got a little rubble flag on everything. Yeah, and they got another one called Solty Dog. Oh yeah. I wonder if that's any any. I've seen a few of those. Something like Solty, or I don't know. I guess I didn't say that. But, uh, no, I'd say in like with the hair. They're called or after said something about the hair. And now you call it a porcupine tail. Yeah. I got mine off. I had one of those for a while. Exactly. Then you outgrow it. You stop it. It's so child- Exactly. Like if you're about 10 it's okay. Well, I did it for the girls. And they liked that? Oh, they love it. Yeah, but they probably is. They were 10 too. They were? I said the problems. They were like 10 or 11 too. That's not it. No, no, no. But, uh, yeah. And, you know, what do they like about that? It gives me something to grab onto. Is that it? Well, no. Well, that's not a suit with me because they got plenty of grab onto it. I'm sure that. Yeah. I take care of that part. They're just for the look. Uh-huh. You know, it's fine. Maybe they got bad eyesight. I don't know. But, uh, first of all, I mean, uh, last of all. Last in closing. Right. That, uh, I hope we, this team, who will work out. I hope it does. Good as the brave's are doing right now. Yes, sir. And I'm glad to hear that you're following the brave's now. And what do you mean I'm following the brave's now? What do I say that? Well, because now you're always talking good about them. Well, because they're playing great. I, I, I try to be honest. I love the cops, but they suck. Okay. They don't mean I don't love them. And I don't watch them and get, uh, heartburn and, uh, hysterical. But, uh, you got to be honest, sir. One thing I'd like to see is, uh, Harry, Harry. Come over here and do ours. Now you're talking. Now that would be good. Well, let's take up a collection. Okay. And, uh, little things from the archives. I just want to tell you, you know, them do spiked out there. Why are you bouncing there? My teeth are... Okay. And, uh, the enclosing. And closing. Bye. See ya. Ha ha ha. Wow. Talk about a multi-faceted call that just had everything from A to Z from soup to nuts if we can say that. Okay. Twenty-one till two. Let's go to Miami. Hello. Yes, sir. First time calling? Great. And, uh, well, I don't want to smooth you run, but I do have a request. The notebook is fucking, uh, right. I'm trying to record, uh, the cartridge from, uh, Nancy and Ron Reagan from, uh, Frank Sinatra, but every time you play them in the car, I'm idea- You're- every time I play it in the shower? In the car. Oh. And, um, so I can't record our chess one, right? If you can squeeze that out. Well, I do mean Frankie, Frankie, is that the one? Uh, no. Wait, uh, report about Nancy. Yeah, Frankie, thank you. Well, what do you mean, no? Yeah, that's the one. Are you sure? Yeah. Because I got it right now. You do? I'm ready to do it for you, but if it's the wrong one, that's the end of this, you know? I bet you have the right one. Be a- You sure? Have you got your thing going? Uh, it's going. Okay. Thanks a lot. Don't do it again, though. Okay. One time for life for a customer. Sounds good. So, yeah. You think that- is this the one he wants? Bio-requered presents old Louis on an unauthorized new album called Frankie. Frankie, when I'm around there, she just can't say no. That's why the first lady has a dream. Yes, Frank Sinatra is back. And his time he's in the Lincoln bedroom. And the now your end is near. And the so I draw the bedroom curtain. Black Sinatra, the legend, the latch. Around and then see, around and then see. One was napkin while the others and see. This album is so hot, even the riggins are smoking. To be to be to be to be. You'll get bitchcraft. It was a very good rear. And of course. And then you'll go and spoil it all by marrying someone stupid like Ron Reagan. Let me see your moon. And let me send away the garb. You'll get a check out of Frankie Bankie, available now on busybody records and tapes. I did her boy. Where? Well, I loved a little space there at the end because he's taping it. And I don't want to like jump right in there. Who knows what he's playing it on another radio station. We don't want to jump on it. Hi, Alia. How you doing? Great. I'm on a mobile. Yeah. People who drive in Halea. They're too speck that design Halea as an asshole. Yeah. Well, listen, they can't even figure out what the names of the streets are. We told you one. They had to renumber them. Give me a break. Like 49th is 103rd and 102nd is 102nd. I hope I held those. What do this? So much crap is what it is sir. Yeah, sure is. Except for this. I got a solution. We can get this team together here. Yeah. All we got to do is get all these extra airlines. This sheet has a draft and start working them out. Okay. Why don't we get some of those airline pilots? We can call it the Miami pilots. Yeah. Nobody's using that name anymore. That's true. That was it. Okay. I just want to call this designer finally on Tuesday. See you. What? Hey, listen, they were the Seattle pilots. I like pilots better than Mariners. Mariners sound like a bunch of old sea fairing. Cape Cod, crumudgeon like old farts. Those old salty nasty, surly guys with that ricky ticky captain. Did you hear that call by the way? You didn't hear ricky ticky's call. He was wound up like an alarm clock in heat. About the baseball thing. About how he grew up in St. Louis in the 1820s. And, uh, oh man, just on and on and on and on. He got to say more here in three minutes and he gets to sail over there in like five years. Let's go to Pemberg Pines. Hello. Mr. Rogers. Yes sir. We're going south for depreciate with the godfather's given you time. Yeah, we do. Okay. Now we notice a couple of concessions that he made. We'll be named Miami, Mafia. And he will control the concessions. The couple de fruity, too, yeah. Ready to follow. 200 will sleep with the fish. Okay. We got it. Yes. 143 at WIO Day. We have an open-line and broad. 5, 2, 4, Tom Hagan is back. Let's go to North Miami Beach. Neil. Yeah. This is a guy that sent is among beans a few weeks ago. Oh, yeah. I'm sure. I'm sure. But Joey Reynolds. Better for those toads in my backyard. Just to all day in under back taking a long rest. Joey Reynolds's fire report. Uh-huh. This afternoon. Poor thing. WSRF. Oh, today's the day, huh? With special guest Sam Friedman. Sam Fear. Sam Far. Who is Sam Friedman? Who the hell is that? Another. Watched up old fart. Yeah, you go. I am that him right now. That sounds like it. But yeah. Today is the day. It's worth 30s. A big show. Okay. I'll be listening with Bated Breath. I'm sure. I'll get my shirts out just in case. Thanks for the warning, sir. Yes, sir. Okay. Speaking of radio celebrities who get to save very little while, they're popping out all those cornball hits. I'm not sure you've had. Yeah. I had a show. I'll tell you about this thing about Larry King. Before you tell me, the other thing I like about Joey Reynolds the most, though. What? He's dying! Go for it! Anyway, just morning I was driving the work you can't get to see an end up in Colonel Springs at four o'clock. So I was just in the Larry. Why not? The statement was well as he can't get it. See an O' you mean CNN radio? Yeah, I insist. Oh, good. Well, I like to keep been form before going on here. I know that he won't. When I used to work at INZ doing nights, I would drive, go and home to Pembroke Lakes. I would drive up the road to Pembroke Road. We should be like about seriously, like about a mile away. I couldn't hear the station. That's like working at the service. Yeah. Boy, is he going to be a monster over there? Well, anyway, last night Larry had Dave Barrier. That's what I heard, Mr. Historia. Yeah, right. And they were chuckle it up and somebody called from Miami and he had to dump them. And a couple of calls later. Someone called from Fort Bonario to the Demospendil Rogers. Oh, yeah. Larry, what a pony this guy is. Larry goes. The old Rogers is he's still in radio. And I'm going to do it that. Yeah. He says, oh, yeah. He's on, I don't need to. I'm here. He's going to talk to him. He goes, oh, my amy is. I thought he was in Fort Bonario. Larry had the day says, well, Larry is the same market. Is if he didn't know. Yeah. And then he says, if you, I haven't seen him in years. I wouldn't know if I saw him. Well, I'm the only guy who weighs 8,000 pounds in town. So I probably stand out. Well, no. He's the thing. Talk about countertictory. Just before he said that, he said, the last time I saw Neil was a pop of the harness track. And he proceeded to say, I wouldn't know if I saw him. Yeah. So, well, the interesting part of it is I've never seen Larry at pop of the harness track. And of course, he doesn't know anything about the show. Hi, it's Larry King, and they don't come any better than Neil Rogers. What the, about Larry, he may not be consistent, but he's sure full of crap. You know what? Bad for sure. Yeah. I just want to let you know that. Well, listen, he's got a check in a mail for you for this call. Okay. If you want to go play basketball tonight with a bulls, see us on it. I don't know. Yeah. One thing. Don't panic, now. I'm still here. I took a couple calls and I'm sure this morning about baseball came up because of the headlines. And other than you, which I think would be so after that, please, revolutionary, you probably won't get the job. That's right. But somebody suggested, no Allen would not be great. Enough of the fucking. Well, I would be great if Mel were still alive. Are they have to, they have to prep him for 12 weeks before it takes that to this weekend baseball. So if he were still alive, it would be great. Well, good luck. Thank you, Johnny. Bye, Mel. Okay. 147. Oh, that Larry King may not tell you. He is a piece of, uh, and then we'll do it that something. Okay. Let's do our last break of the day here while we're still on a good mood. We'll be right back. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm wondering that, I want to get comfortable about that. I'm curious about why. And boats we could talk about earlier. About what? Bigger's cars and boats. Now we're talking about bridges over the, uh, Causeway not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any of my friends. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Calm down, sir. You can deep-end that. But you're regulated by the United Corps of Engineers. You've got to give. No. Well, it is all bridges over 9 with the blue waterway. If I knew that, I wouldn't have been asking, sir. But that, I said if I knew the answer to the question, I wouldn't have asked it in the first place. Okay. Well, I'm saying, sir, here's that P9 estate Corps of Engineers. Are the ones that regulate bridges over 9 with blue waterways? Over one? 9 with the blue waterway. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be open to the marine traffic. Yes. And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir? I'm telling you that day come up with the times. Well, what is the time? I believe it's at wish hour times, sir. That they are not open to marine traffic. Other than that, they are open to marine traffic. So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months. Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crafters there? That is not a communist bunch of facts. Sounds like some kind of re-entithal facts just tell me, pick a, you got time to see the way. Right, exactly. The boat is going to stop for 5,000 cars. Got it? No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one Jack Hanson is boat. I think that's what they ought to do. Thank you, but I know your law is Mr. Because you should go. That's right. I suppose you want the damn biggest coast to both of it and the heart can do. I want the bridges closed period. I want them closed. I want the bridge tended to go home and watch the MTV and get the hell out of our lives. I want those bridges closed. Let them use the Julia Tuttle, okay? Let them use the Bacarta Closwood. I think they all ought to go out of George Washington and bridge and jump all of bridge tenders. How do you like that, sir? Well, I don't know about you, but you shall like some stupid idiotic tip.
