Well, I got a tune to them, I'd go truck in coast and coast. I like my rig, I like the rub, but it's not what I love most. There's a gal I left in Fresco, a sweet young fine name rose, and the best dang thing about her. She lets me wear her clothes, and well I'm proud to be a country transvest child. And I loved where the girls go all day. All day. Lacing bra, a thrilling blouse, a silk in neck, and Jane, now I'm still a macho tough guy, in a hoopier London stand. Hives more than the big black mustache, and a six pack in my hand. But when I go out for more, I do it well the twist. All worse, strapless evening, and down in a nose gay, all my ribs, as I proud to be a country transvest child. You look, all the girls in your business. I close my lips, tease my heart, sleep in London, now I like the way I'm living. Don't get me by my clothes. I'm all American, he made out of love, and I always get so don't look at me funny, or I'll punch out your lines, and the last thing you remember, there's a trucker in fish net ties. Just a pad to make, country transvest child. And I loved where the girls go all day. All day. Painted lips, padded hips, my shape legs on display. Yes, I passed the base, country transvest child. And I loved where the girls go all day. Stowling me, some of the views, well it's in us all my words. Yes, I proud to be a country transvest child. I get to pan and hold on here, and hope I don't get a run. You know, I hate that. I hate that. You know what you chip your nail, not things like so hard to stare at what you do. I would take him out with nothing. You can put it on the part that you wouldn't have to do it every day. You know what I'm trying to do? I could use a bubble by it. I really could. And I'm going to go to the shop. I am. I was inspired to play that because I see Randy as playing a thing that I cut your music. Why did they have such fanatical fan? She asks, I'm sure you're very concerned about that. Guess include the program director of Kiss Radio. As in Kiss This, the Nashville Network and interviews with Marie Osmond, Mary Gatlin and Genie C. Rally and many more. U-Boy, maybe Randy's going back to Kiss. I'm glad you listened to something. No, no. Oh, wait a minute. Are you here to go? Finally, maybe has returned to the day before. Oh, I don't care what my father says. I want you to hold me. But now, she's got a brand new partner. Who quiet? Gadget see, I'm trying to use the phone. Yes, it's Jennifer Gray and P. We Herman. Together again for the first time in Murdy Dension. And the next ever, Tell Jennifer what, how about this is a... I know. Ouch! Are you steps on my sketch of jerk? I know you're a bit wet, am I? Oh, can we? You've got to be so obnoxious? Abnoxious? Oh, that's the way to get there. No, or then a movie. It's an excuse to release another soundtrack out of the box. That's a funny act that got to rock. A nerdy dancing. Now, showing it a playhouse near you, a rock. Right. T-Rexus, we different, Merrill, one of you, Let's sing different, merrill, one of you. Okay, that's a good point. Come. Shuffling down the street. They got the used piece of muckers. Because they got the old best. They had the old monkey. That's you, don't run the song. They say we smell candy, funky. And they're all stupid, I know. They make money from millions. And I care about heavy. They're just a stay home. Pizza, nice dress, I think. But now lemon. I hide the old monkeys. And here all who's in our hair. This week, they run the TV. Next week on Merrill Care. Yeah, they're right, I can't do this. I'm talking about it. It's the mud. They're morning meal, Raju's show. Okay, that's great. 1118 and WIDEN. You're still there? Yeah. What happened? I don't know. You thought I was a brush palm or something. Or are you? Okay. What could it be? It's close enough. Yeah, what does happen to Stan Major? Whatever happened to him, he's alive in well in plantation and life goes on. Is he working in a station? For Mike Waymer, I got a sign of the autograph here when you're a big star. When you weigh 450 pounds. No, he's heard that last night. The only station you'll see Stan and his probably amicov with their armbrard Boulevard. Mm-hmm. But he's doing okay. I heard you were mentioned on Larry King. Yeah, you didn't hear the tape? Oh, I was, no, I heard it like around 450. But we have it on tape. Do you want to hear it? Yeah. Now will you hold on? Yes. Then you come back and come and I'll put you on hold again. You're probably used to it by now. Hold on a second. Ashford and Simpson. That's not the right thing. Why have done that twice? That's three mistakes. That's for that old bitch that called before. Evergreen life like and a butcher. You're a rider. Oh, he must be jealous. He's jealous, isn't it? I guess. You know what they did to me though? They said anybody hearing Miami he's old money by a Larry King turn your headlifed on. I'll tell you what, I'll look like this old damn town was going through the funeral. Yeah, he's so feel so familiar. Oh, yeah. Yeah, you know the whole story is he said. Yeah, he doesn't make a lot of money and he's been there that market a long time. And he really would rather probably even rather ride on this horses. Oh, he's kind of sad. But he's been jealous the long time. I haven't seen him. And what is this 1990? The last time I saw him was in 1970. Seven. Seven. As long as he's at the back in 1977. And many call me the day then he admitted he was a homeless sector. On a very call me to thank me because I had had Sergeant McLevick on the air. Then I before he had heard Sergeant McLevick. Stem his MATL of it. MATL of it. Since passed on with AIDS. Encourage people who were homeless sectors to come out of the closet. And Neil had heard the show and came out of the closet the next day. On his own radio show. And then called me to thank me for having McLevick on. And then I heard some people like yourself saying he does this. But I feel very sorry for people who are kind of caught in that local web of jealousy. I don't understand. And I heard he weighed like 400 pounds. But I haven't seen him. You know, last time I saw him I'd say weighed 350. Okay, that's it. Now are you a homeless sector, though? Today. Oh, this is Mr. Radio. Oh, my God. We went, you know, wondering, hung on so long. That's Mr. Radio. 21 after 11 at WOD and we have an open line in Broward. 5249463. Maybe pansy would be. I live up to that. We have an open line in Palm Beach. 655. I can't believe it. Now, listen, you always call from Daytona. He wasn't caught from a bokeh. He called from Daytona Beach and lied about it. You make a sick, Mr. Radio. Okay. 6249463. Watch the matter, dear. Oh, grandpa, man can be such a cold. Oh, here, honey. Why don't you try some of this nice hot, loathir Campbell soup? Look, they're Campbell soup. But Grandpa, we just had two lives, two last minutes. No, no, but this is all a different. That's all. It's got the whole awful bit in it. See the little letters? Look, there's an F and a U and just try it, honey. Look, it's completely tasteless. Why would anyone eat this? Why? It'll only be so hungry, that's why. Looth the Campbells. Focus, ho, they cook tastes so vulgar. You'll be tempted to eat it with a pool. No, I won't ask you to shut the hall. I'll say it, but oh, no. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Mmm, bad. Looth the Campbells, ho, they're hungry. Oh, word. Okay, 1126. Wow. We're doing it, you know what? Let's just put that on an endless loop and go home. Let's try tamaract. Neil. Yes, sir. I was in Pompano last night, making my weekly donation. Yeah. And I ended up with a spire report. I think week is my word at Pompano this year. That's W.E.A.K. I've been real week. I haven't even come close this year. No, I just don't know if this screamer eat a banana. Do you remember hitting the tail race, Wayne? I've never been there, but a new hamstring man. Yeah, rocking ham. I've been there many, many of the time. There's a bug boy at Bucky Day. Bucky Day, that's right. That's for dry. Bobby Huntress. Do you remember General Washington? There's a Beckwith. What was his name? What? No, Beckwith. There was a... Ted Wing. Ted Wing, Alex Winger. Uh, where we go, Vincent? Do you know how much the audience hates this when we do it? That's why I like to do it. How about Steve Warren? Called, we see Warren, it's good. He's a bad whole-warrant in family man. They can drive a horse. But you know what Larry King said? I'd rather be riding a harness horse. That's what Larry said. How about, um, Green Mountain Raceway? In Vermont, Longson's closed. Wrong, since Scowheagin. What? Scowheagin down's in Maine. They got those great tracks like Cumberland and Scowbro. Right, they do a 235 mile-up there. Yeah. But I have a sparyport for you. Okay. Alan Finkelson. Mike. Fell off of a golf cart. Yeah. While working in Valley Parking. Might knock some sense into him. No, it knocked money into his pocket. He's on work as compensation. When was this? Uh, it happened last week. I saw him at the track last night. You saw him? Yes. Saw. Yeah. And he was complaining about the fact that he can't go back to work in Valley Parking. Mike's always complained because he never hasn't cashed a ticket in 20 years. No, he hasn't. I can't find the ankle, bro. Card isn't that enough to really make a frost your ass a little bit. How about? How about? How about? How about? How about? How about? Don't know it. What? And find her? Yeah. How about? Yeah. Dr. Jay. Dr. Jay. I just thought I'd sneak him in there. Okay. I would like to take this opportunity to call two of my friends, Oscar and Joey. We'll be playing Rocket for all this afternoon. Yeah. Dooshbex. Okay. And I look forward to seeing you with the track. I'm coming up tonight at the time. I'm coming up tonight at the time. I'm playing. And I'm barrowing. Stay the hell away from me. Okay. Go away. I'm coming up. We're not going to have a break up there. You're a little table. And Schmouse with Alan. The assistant made her D up there and leave me alone. Hey I got a great idea. She's like a kiss that I got to do with see him. And immediately. I just can't pick my nose. Why don't you have a race up there for Camilla's house. Dinner? Well, I'm going to talk to Alan tonight. If it goes tonight is about doing something for Camilla's. Sure. Well, we'll make donations. And go up there and get a night of racing. I got news for her. They could build their whole new building with the live-lapted Pomp and already the season below. We left it pumping though. You bet. What about wheeling down? Good luck. Good bye. See you. Another Hialia call? Hello there. Yes sir. Five hours of sports to call. Alright here we go. In other words you haven't even heard what I'm going to do yet. You're already passing judgment, which is right next to passing gas. Is he going to stay on sports top now or is he going to know? Last time he's on show he never appears there anymore. Well I wouldn't say he'd never appear there but he's not going to be on that show. He's got his own thing. They got their thing and he's got his thing and over the 20s he'll meet. You're going to make him promise not to talk sports. No he's going to talk some sports but he's a well-rounded guy and if you've seen him lately and you're not talking about him. Now he's a fun guy. He can he'll develop a thing. Oh and speaking of Steve you'll never guess who's new best. But let me ask you this question before. I don't want to try to sway you but who'd you rather hear from me to 11 Randy Martin or Hank Goldberg. Stan Major. Okay. Now what is it about Steve? He's new best buddy in the world. Be sides with excitement. Alex Bennett. Yeah. Yeah they met up there and well they share this one contempt. You know anybody who's hostile toward me is Steve's best buddy that's his whole thing in life. For excitement and Bob Cunston Ellis Ruben that's the only guy that he knows that I like and that likes me is non-kent. That is his new motivation for why he's out to get Rick Riley. Oh yeah he's good. You know I'll be honest I punch did I punch him up at all yesterday I think for about 30 seconds on a way home and what was he doing yesterday? Open phone. I don't remember what it was but whatever it was it was so terminal I just punched it out I told you the novel he wears off very fast okay. Now he's grasping at the fact that Rick Riley stole Alex Bennett's job. Yeah oh yeah. I wasn't honest to a nervous breakdown. Well he stole somebody's job over there at FTL he brought in fact he did in the most devious way of all he brought in his own sponsors and he blew somebody out whoever was doing midday because they moved my crowverts up to 10 to 2 so somebody got blown out to make room for him. But he's still making 250 dollars a year. Yeah at least maybe maybe half a million. That's what he said I said how to do and work on a commission. Hey let's say you make 250 dollars a year. Oh god well you can't teach an old dog new trickster. That's true. Have a great life. Bloodloat. 1147. 1147. At Wilding a mobile in Miami hello. Hello New York. Great. I have a couple of fire reports. Okay. I was up on the I 75 and just caught some Steve came yesterday. He was big five to six hour. Yeah. He comes back from the news and he's screaming to me. I guess his producer or whoever he was screaming to me. What are you looking at me that way? You could hear Steve was saying apparently his Mike Cored was being disconnected or something. And he was just yelling. Maybe they're tying Steve cords again. Yeah and he just did all another technical difficulty. It was amazing. Well good luck to him. He needs a real bushly operation. But the guy's got to make a living. He's got a family to support. He's got to go out there and sell those spots and beg everybody to support his sponsors. Yeah. And then I was... I don't mind supporting Steve's spots but I don't think Leather Weinstein is what I'm ready for yet. No not yet. I won't enjoy him supporting those. Well actually any of Steve's sponsors actually. But then I was listening to Rick and Sides and he had a guy talking about pirate and music and Evan called. Who did? Evan? One of the other. Evan. I got to apologize to Evan. He was over at the remote at specs on Wednesday and I didn't recognize him. He's got this funky little go-teen out. He looks so bizarre. Well he's a... Well he's a... Yeah he said even a system manager at a record store and being in the industry he knew quite a bit of what they were talking about. I didn't pay for the beer. I'm glad you found that one, Neil. Isn't that great? I feel a lot better now. Well and I'd like you to say I don't think Hank is going to do five hours of sports. No way. I mean he'll do a... He'll interspersalize sports just like I do on his show but it's not a sports show. Sure he has to get always food topics in and he's big with the women too so... That's what we hear. Yeah. I think it's on your rumor. I think it's on your rumor. Well you have a good day. Only is here to rest your nose for sure. That's true and before I go I'd like to call John and Jim and Duce Ben. Okay. Thank you. Sit on come any better, Hank Goldberg. Turned about. We're in the round of the doors. We listen. Stand for the door. Hello. What's warm? I'll say you and come your arms. And run me. And be with me. You come your arms. Pardon me? Have you been here before? No. First time. What's your name? Three way. Three way that night. Once they get to meet you. They get to learn here. You know, you were here to get to clean up. Oh, I don't know. You work around here. I'm a waiter but I shall am an actor. Oh yeah, you know what's the topic? You probably need to rely. Oh, I'll say. But you know what everything is in news and all that's to pay. You can start relaxing right now. Anyway, I brought something. Ooh, she. And be wait. Not just any she either. Look. Wow. Goldberg. Nice. Pretty good. Come on. Here's the most important part. Be wait for the protest label. protest. I'm those in Georgia. By the city council of San Francisco. Absolutely. You know the protests slogan, don't you? I sure do. Certified safe by the city by the bay. Well, what do you say? John, look at that. I dropped the soap again. Wow, John. You bet your life he will. And with confidence. Because freeway and spikid have come to me. Don't let worry spoil those camps meetings and public showers. Always carry. Protect. The ROC EEC. Keep my mind free. SMB. The ROC EEC. Been down with no apology. I can't be happy to be back. I can't be happy to be back. Don't. Don't know what it's all about. The protests shoot. So they won't send you a re. Protect condoms. The vision of Black Black House and Biden. That's the motivation. Keep in situation safe since 1887. Hollywood. Hey, Neil, what's happening? How you doing? All right, look, please. Well, I wish you had to burst and had to be on a burst even though it was a little bit late. Well, thanks a lot. OK, listen, I got something for you to hear. It's only about a minute long. Can you hear? What is it? Give me a little hint. It's called the rubber saw. The rubber saw. Am I going to have to dump it? No, no, it's clean. OK. All right, hold on. Sometimes, that thing. There we go. OK, we're ready for it. You're a dealer. Keep away. OK, it's 11 out. Wow. I always like those, especially when they're like real far away. In that case, I think maybe a little farther would have better. Hello. Yeah, I got a bigger port for you, Neil. OK. Go on with your time. I mean, beach and early hikies and douchebags. All right. Short and sweet, what do we need? If I had the ability to do it, I take you out here right now. Kick your goddamn teeth in San Francisco. Good morning, Neil. Are you really in the city by the gate of the bay? Yes, I am. Come on, which down a little. OK. I will go and listen to Alex or maybe 20 minutes. Yeah. His guest was Mary Wilson of the Supreme. When he comes back from the news, he was five minutes in this. Good for around with the lives of you. How do you think, guess who he mentioned? Eric, planberg. You come on here. And you bash me. Yeah. I could. I fell over. I mean, even here he's here. Well, Alex likes guys without too much hair. Or talent. I was about the only exception he's ever made. So it's going to be nice and warm for a change here today. Really? Now it's supposed to get up to middle 70s. So is Diane Feinstein coming back to the foothold now? Is she coming back there with her tail between her thing? I haven't even picked up in these days. I know I do. I usually call you sweet water. She came pretty close, I'll tell you. But I have enough of you. Don't care. That would bother me, Emily. Because that would be Wilson, man. You never saw a free training. Wouldn't steal. What a gun. Hey, listen. It's a screwed up state. What can I tell you? It's great here now. Boy, the sun is shining in the, oh, it's just heaven. Everybody's wheeled mellow, kind of laid back to snoring. It's still stronger than heaven. All right, just want to give you comments. I hate from the West Coast. Well, be sure and call Alex and give him our best. And it's very obvious. You two guys are out of work and you want the afternoon shift. Yeah. So they ought to come here and take your shift here. Well, guess what? What? Next year. Finally, I'll see you. Wow, call from San Francisco. That made my day around here. It's the most tasteless thing I've ever heard in my life. And I'm driving the work. I have a show to do. And I'm getting ticked off at you. Call of the, if I had the ability to do it, I take you out here right now. I'm ticking your goddamn teeth in. Well, I could build it. He is probably the key word. Yeah, I'll hold this in my key. I'll tell you what, then. You sure left a, uh, a definite impression, a bowl on my brain. You're nobody. Just somebody love you. I want to hear about that letter box for me. I don't know about it. Just somebody can't. You're my big team. You're my possessed. The world. All it's done. But go once by your hand. And then. And you're growing old. The world's still the same. You'll never change. Okay, here we go. We get to the really good stuff now. Look out. I'm long. Here we go. I've got a nice time. We've got a nice time. You know, your life is shining, right? Before we let that finish. Can I ask a simple question? What the hell were they thinking about when they put that man on a year here? What in God's name possessed them? To put that slime on a year? I just, uh. I don't know, but it is somebody. It's somebody. It's somebody. It's somebody. It's somebody. It's somebody. It's somebody. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Okay, happy whatever it is, Alex. Happy 40th birthday. He's down to 40 now, you know that? A year from Suckus, he's going to be a teenager again. We have an open line in date, 751, Eric Lambert is God, and one in Palm Beach, 655, 9463, W-I-O-D, Pembroke Pines. Now, for Neil Rogers here's Randy Martins, I do Suck with you six ten W-I-O-D. Yeah. That's not working. What about women being wrong here? Oh, I have to stop that. And figure it out. Figure it out. I'll be back. Oh, overwhelming. All right, we get some cards. Got some numbers. We got some empty line. Wow. Oh, no. No. Not me and the mind again. Oh! Okay, let's go to... Daniel. Yes, I want to hear you. Okay. Now listen, I turn on a few keys. Here we go. Like yesterday. And the first color, guess who it was. No, I heard Gilbert. He didn't kill me. Oh, no! Yes, they're sucking up to him saying how great they are, how happy they are to these back now. I want to tell you something. If I always told you about watch out for the cronics, they're a bunch of phony but suckers and they fly around like butterfly. I agree. Like a bumblebee, they flip from one perch to another, I hope, culminating everywhere. Those two are the biggest phonys. They were out with Rick and suds in the beginning doing their little joint at the hip routine on the phone and sucking around with them. And then they came over here and they ruined our Wednesday lunches. And now they're all of a sudden sucking around over there. Yeah, they were a bash Rick and suds two things. They called them Steve King Jr or whatever. Unbelievable. You came said, yes, they said, he told everybody, well, who was listen, one person said, you really, you must have been the one. He said that you really don't like Rick and suds. You just give him positive things. Well, you know, it's really interesting that he makes those things up because I have never, I haven't spoken to Steve since they came here. I've the only time I've spoken to him right here on the air. I've never said that. It's totally untrue and it's another, if he said that, which all I have is your word, it's another one of his lies. Just like just like the thing about the Disney telling us we can't put any colors on it, mention his name. Steve, why do you make up so much BS? Let's, let's send Steve a big shovel. Okay. Okay. When he said, if somebody asked you and you were to answer honestly on scale of one to ten, you being a ten, how Rick and suds are doing. And you were to be totally honest. You would say no more than a one. Oh, yeah. That's why they got a four seven in the last book. What was Steve's last number here? A three five with some very embarrassing demographics? Yeah, I know Steve K is listening. He is totally pouring and that would be the last time I ever listened to that. Now you'll turn it on again. No, I swear I won't. Rick and suds are great. I agree with that. Okay. Okay. But just keep making it up, Steve. Just keep desperately flailing around trying to cause that big controversy because it just ain't happening. I mean, like I said, I wish him all the luck in the world. And his success or lack of it is going to have nothing to do with Rick and suds or this station. I mean, the only thing this station has got to do with it is we've given a more promotion than over there, which is nothing because they haven't got two nickels to rub together at FTO. But that's about it. So we certainly can't blame us for it. We've given him a big send-off. But, geez, you've got to make your own thing. You've got to do your own thing. You can't try to siphon off from the rest of the world forever. You have to stand in your own two feet. Be a man. Like Marlon Brando said, and we still want to know what the hell he knows about it. United States has no quarrel with the Iraqi people. Our quarrel is with Iraq's dictator and with his aggression. Iraq will not be permitted to annex Kuwait. Just the way it's going to be. We like to be Saddam Hussein, and he's here with the heart. Sit back and watch his head and smile. Like the middle of way to arrive. He's right to steal away Kuwait. And be the O' you see, O' you see, O' you see, O' you see, Up to his head and the O' you see, To be on the high light, to be the way. We don't play out of the desert. Shut up, go, go, life with it, and say. I'll be the judge of the nation. The nation is going to pay. Saddam Hussein, gone to blow him away. Saddam Hussein. Double play ball, one. Out of the evening. That's how it was all. So Saddam Hussein, put great. And the clubs get out on the top of the eights. And still the four, but three. Okay, that was the Mexican I just mentioned at OK, here he comes down. Music New talk radio, six ten WIOD presents the New Roger show. To get in touch and talk with Neil, dial 751 WIOD from day.

And then we had the appetizers. And that was funny. I think it would be a lot of food. That would. Yeah. It's a no way. I want to go back and try salad and dessert. Well, try that. When you try dessert, try that mocha crambourly. It's got like a real thick crust on it. In fact, next week, Marvins is going to go out and put some of that crust from the mocha crambourly in somebody's pants. But it's tremendous. But don't tell Rick. I won't. I don't know because I just want him to know that such had the better suggestion. Some other. What are both great? Yeah, but I live for being in plantation. Armadillo was closer. And I was not disappointed at all. From the outside, you'd never in a million years. You would never know was anything there. It's just like that kind of Yahoo, Davey. I think like I need to go get some muffler parts. Right. Right. While you're a poem of your horse up to the Hitchin post. That's right. This I heard Randy mentioned last night that she didn't get a memo about how much was collected for nothing. It's actually set on the air. How much you'd collected. Great. Well, good for her. Yeah, she's getting her peasing keys down. Well, work an extra hard on it because she'll probably be over there pretty soon. So we're doing our best. Oh, and the old little bee fun to have, Hank. Yeah. I don't like to do the radical about Rick and the. I've just been bruising. Yes, I've just been picking little spots. It's realized when a nice guy was. Who said that? The year old. He talked about it. That mean he has some some personal things. Oh, no, in that respect, yeah, but don't let a fool you. But I do agree that he has gotten a little bit less of a homer listening to him on the radio. Can be. While he said it's said it's going to load him as compass. Which direction should he go? Exactly. Where is that ball? Have a great weekend. Thank. Okay. One, fourteen. But the classic standard 10. Ten rock and roll. On 97 GTR. You don't play to men in sisters. Ha ha ha ha. Oh, man, there's some heavy duty stuff in there. And here's one that doesn't even have a label on it. It's probably blank. Get ready with your finger on that button. Fort Loddale Florida. Hello. Hello, Larry. First time caller. Hi. Listening on WIOD610. I mean, my old station. Yeah, your old station. Two two things. I want to get your comments on Neil Rogers, both professionally and personally. What? I've got to tell you this. This is people will never believe this. This cart hasn't even got a label on it. I had no idea what it was. It's in the bottom of the thing. They were all this GTR stuff. And there it is. It's almost like an oldman. And also, how would you go about getting into talk radio? And I'll hang up unless someone called earlier. I haven't heard Neil in years. I have no idea. I remember the time when he came on the ear and came out of the closet. Yeah. And then I left my amy shortly after that. I've not heard him since. He does a kind of shock value. It's not my kind of spit. I'm told he does a shock value. You know, what can I say next to shock you? And that's not my kind of speed. As a workable, I haven't heard him in 13 years. Nashville. Hello. Wow. Boy, thank God we saved that. 119 on a very Larry King intensive Friday. It means I must go. I probably wouldn't 50 dollars tonight, right? It's what it sounds like. Unlabeled old GTR cards. And finally, Michael, I know it's a holiday. And President Bush is vacationing. And Kenny Bunkport main. And join the day off from the White House. But hey, I still want to give him a call. I'd say happy fourth July. After all, it is the nation's birthday. Okay. Well, now, Jerry's still out. I'm sure spray cans may be bad for the ozone. But you're going to take away bars, can't it? The V05. Well, she'll look just like it. You're winter. Oh, wow. We got some wild stuff. A little channel 7 card there. It's incredible. And speaking of wild stuff. Hey, Neil, I done. You'll never guess who's on the phone now. Well, I guess it's pretty heavy duty. Pretty heavy duty. I'm supposed to go. I'm supposed to go. I'm supposed to go. First about your shouting. Okay. We can hear you. I know you're emotional. And you're trying to flex your muscles. I want to do what the beach is. I know how it is. But just relax. Take a deep breath. We got lots of time. Okay. Let's just amelize the entire situation out. Find it exactly. If you guys are as disloyal. Well, I just like to say one thing is so. I didn't call Ian called by himself alone. You're not there. Didn't know about that. Let him know by himself alone. What? Wait a minute. Hold on a second. What line is on it? Quick. She's gone. Oh, she's gone. That was the old bag. She hung up. Oh. Yeah. Go ahead, I'm sorry. Yeah. Well, like I said, I did not call him. I never called Ian called. Yeah. So that's all I'd say. I'm just going to call him. Yeah. I'm just going to call him. Yeah. But once you on with me with Ian a couple of weeks ago, when the news broke that Mr. King was coming back on a year. Yeah. And you were saying, oh boy, we are so extra. And both of us are going to be great. Those guys are okay. But we're all going to. And we're going to show you the same guys that came on with them in the beginning when they first came on to the afternoon and sucking around and calling together. I mean, I don't understand what kind of loyalty you guys have got. Well, I'll be here. No, it's all. It's easy. You know, this is incredible. This is even such a state of the with his mouth that was to the thing down there. The other of you can't believe you. How can you call guys on the year and go on about how great they are and become a little superstar? You're like a radio butterfly. You're like a butterfly. Aren't you embarrassed? I don't know. I've nothing to say. No, no. That's not an answer. Well, no. Calvin, but I don't want to see. What is it? Why? Isn't it Steve? He came before I can start him on. Yeah. And then I was never going to start. I always feel like I didn't do. No, no. You sound like Steve. You're sucking around me. It's not going to work. That doesn't play with me. But we're not discussing me. We know this shows great. Okay. The bottom line is 2 to 6 in the afternoon. You've got your choice. You can let's have some fun with Rick and Sides. Are you going to talk or you can listen to a man making a living on the year. Self-provoting with 85 minute breaks and traffic and the try to figure out how to get out that little room. And if you want that's fine. But I don't understand why one day these guys are great. You're having a great time. And the next day you're like sucking around. Is that what you want to be known for all your life? Is sucking around? I don't understand. Come on. Stand up for yourself. Don't be such a whimp just because he has got you, you know, some kind of an attitude. Why do I do like Steve Kane? I mean that's the same now. What do you like about him? He's fun to listen to. Fun? How about that show Tuesday the four hour funeral for Michael Hanne on air Did you listen to that show? I didn't listen to that one. Why not? Because of Tuesday. Tuesday and I'll listen to that. Oh. Listen to it. Oh. Oh. Oh. Why not? Because up on the wooden board. Oh. And what's going to happen? What's going to happen? Wait. No. I'm not going to have a conversation with you. I'm not trying to sell one way or the other because to each it's own. If whatever makes you happy. What about when Ellis Rubin is going to be on? Is that going to be fun? He'll be fine. What about when Rick's sight him and is it? What you've heard all those guests a minute times if your Steve Kane-Listner. Have a two. Yeah. But I don't remember what they had to say. Oh. The little little relapse. So what I'm saying absence makes the parts grow fonder. Yeah. You might be right. But take it. You're going to have a lot of commercials. I will pay that. Yeah. Great. All the time. Well, why do you want me to just take a have a telephoto collection and take up the money. And you know, maybe you can do a show. Yeah. I'm not doing it. Thank you. You're a waffling Kelvin. I know. Well, I'm unfortunate. I. You should be flustered. Rick Rally is wounded. He's hurt. He's a sensitive emotional basket case already. And you guys are like butterflies. One day they're great. Now Steve's great. And if like some real famous person like John McHugh comes on, he afternoon on QA. And you'll be gone. I'm saying you're great. Watch out. Watch out. Won't you? No. Definitely not. I think the least you can do like Monday is the holidays. Come over here and take your clothes off in the studios. The least you can do to make up for it. Okay. Okay. See you. Alright. Let's try Fort Lauderdale. Hey Neil, how you doing? Okay. I heard a room where I want to know if it's true. Yeah. I heard you were a bag. Is that true? What? A bag? A fancy. Oh, Ian is on the phone. How you doing, yeah? Oh boy, you guys are just out of control. You need to get like a life transplant you too. I want to tell you Rick Rally and Suds call. I'd like to come to your house and beat the crap out of you with a two by four. Coving needs to put you up a little bit. Yeah. You're going to be at least admit that you guys are butterflies. You're in sincere and you're like suck around everybody. Mostly each other. Markets up 30 points. I would never fly away from you, Neil. See you doing the same thing. He was doing. I'm not impressed by that. That's the oldest chronic talk radio tactic in the world. I suck around with the host. I see through that. You're not talking to Alex Bennett now. But it's true. I never spoke to Alex Bennett. Yeah. All right. But if you would have you. Oh, Alex here. The greatest. Can we come down to being your live studio audience. Can we come down and suck around each of your food and ruin your show? Of course, you didn't need any help. No. Okay. Well, you're a police. I don't believe you already because when you preface the statement by saying you don't believe me, it's pretty obvious that you're full of it. Well, because you don't believe me, so I trusted it. Well, what's the pholonial statement? You've seen that. I mean, I'm listening to you and Steve Kain originally. That's how we need Steve Kain before. What does that have to do with Rick and Puss? Well, it's really nothing to do with it. I mean, I don't know if that's nothing against him. I don't really care about him either. But the point is, see, you both are missing the point. If you were just like kind of like casual colors and you were part of the vast audience out there, the passing parade, that would be one thing. But I have a good memory. Okay. And I remember back in the beginning when these guys first came on a station, the two of you always intend them like joined at the thing were always on the phone, just heaving. You're anating all over them and just carrying on. Oh, I mean, you were just, it was just phenomenal. It was mind boggling. And then all of a sudden, the first day Mr. Contrivedigo comes back on here. Oh boy, we're okay. But boy, he's really, and then I ask your paler, what's so great? What do you enjoy? Did you hear this? Oh, no. Well, I can't listen on that day. And I don't know if I heard this, who probably we boring. See, all you're doing is you just, I don't know what you're doing. What are you doing? I don't know. What do you want to be? Trouble makers? Trouble maker? Try to get Rick Rally's blood pressure up and cousin to have some kind of a cardio-vascular accident, sir. We should get a nice car though. Play some good music today, Johnny. What is it? We should get a nice car to go home, you know. Rick. I'm not kicking you out here, but it's time to go on the air. Johnny, dork. There he goes over to the coast. Right. He took a big, you know, breath a big, a thing of helium before I went over there. Okay. It's 82 along the coast. I can hear right now. He's going to be great today. I don't know. I don't know. I want to tell you. No, no, don't try to change the subject. I still have about a minute to go here. I want you to try to explain to these poor guys why you are a turncoat. I mean, Joe Lee. You're like the angus Allen of radio or was it Ethan Allen or Ethan whatever his name was? No, I'm not like, I mean, anything like a Gilbert. I'm not even close. I was in the youth. You're a turncoat. I was in the youth. Rick and Sirs and Steve Kano or Steve B. I've never listened on AM radio. Yeah, well, I just still not responding to our question. Well, I mean, why did I turn on him? Is that what the question was? Yeah. No reason. I said was listening to the end of Steve Kano back. Yeah. Well, that's really it. Did you like the Maracana show? No, that was that day I didn't listen. Are you going to listen when I listen to Rubin is on? Actually, I think I was Rubin's kind of a- Do you like Rick's side, Herman? I don't even know who that is. Oh. I mean, I know you- How about Reverend Unic Polis? I actually like I told him yes. And are you a lady into that? That's kind of- Because I know the British are into that tea in the afternoon. Well, I don't know. Yeah. I think you guys ought to kind of like spend a real clip. Maybe go up to a new Hampshire or something for the weekend together. Wait, wait. Kind of cozy up in front of a warm fire and discuss this under less pressure when you're away from all the immediate pressures of this radio market and kind of get your thing together. You know, I can genuinely, I might be going to the University of Maryland. Oh, promise? I'm going to be depressed there. How about I get a listen to you every day? Well, you can pick up FtL up there, I'm sure. Have a great weekend, Ian. You too, Ian. You're full of it, okay. You're fine, but- Wow. A couple of radio phonies there. They're not fooling any of you folks. You're a lot too sharp for that, right?
