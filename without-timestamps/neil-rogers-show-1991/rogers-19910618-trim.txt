A chicken farmer went out, one ducking windy day. By the crew purested as he went along his way. Well, it once arrived naked in the eye of what the sight he dreaded. Ghost chickens in the sky. The farmer had reached a ten since he was twenty-four. Working for the Colonel for thirty years or more. Two other chickens and sending them to fry. Now they want revenge. Ghost chickens in the sky. Everybody's alive. The pigs are black and shiny, they're as her burning red. They had no meat or feathers. These chickens were dead. They picked the farmer up. And he died by the claw. They cooked a mixture of crisp. And ate them with the saw. Everybody's alive. They're all chicken all the time. I think chicken the scraps adequately. Some of the people call this show today.

Oh, we got a wonderful call in Miami. What's happening now? Okay. I have a little blue hair by report. Yes, sir. The other day, I'm at a Burger King on about 180th street in Collins. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Because I look on a screen here. It says old guy in Miami. I know what he's been asking me where I was from right now. You know, it sounds like an old guy to me. 27 years old guy. Well, that's pretty old. I guess to George. I mean, you're like a couple years older than he is. I didn't even talk to George. Well, that's it. Okay. Anyway, how'd you get on hold? I don't know. I just called up and I was on my mom and hold. Nobody talked to me or anything. When did you call? About 20 minutes ago. And you got on already? Yeah. Good. Okay. So that means I'm at a Burger King. It's 180th street in Collins. And there's an old guy up there. Uh-huh. And he's ordering his food. And he's ordering for like his grandchildren. I guess the entire family. And he's up there and the guy brings him his order. He's like he's yelling. He's complaining or whatever. The guy brings him his order. And he looks at it and he goes, this is not what I ordered. And the Burger King dude looks at him and says, sir, just where it says on the ticket. And he goes, well, I don't know about you, but you sound like some stupid idiotic jerk. I was on the floor. No. Or it's where it got. Are you serious? On the floor in the, like, was. No. Was it him? Was it the bridge tender? I was afraid to ask him. This guy he looked like he was right. Homicidal. That's the word. On Baleau. Homicidal. I would good day now. Thanks, pal. I mean, I wonder if it sounded just like that. I don't know about you, but you sound like some stupid idiotic jerk. I shut up before I beat the crap, Eddie. Twenty after one at WIO, Miami. Yeah. Yeah. Hey, how's going? I was wondering if you were able to see the plateau you're lying over the weekend. I was watching some ball game, and they were showing like Mercury right on top of Uranus. I mean, it were like right next to each other. Right. Right. Well, I don't know. I don't think the weather was that um. Do you think that explains the behavior of the people today perhaps? Well, could have something to do with it. Maybe somebody broke their thermometer and hell and hell. Because I always hear these astrologers, astrologers saying, like Mercury is in Uranus. Right. Right. Which ought to be painful, I would think. Anyway, I was going to give some advice to some people who might have had some trouble with the telescope, like we did. Yeah. Well, there's a small grass reflector on the inside of it, um, whereby the eyepiece. And the thing is we're working, well, we're reaching the rivals from Boston here. Go to school with that for you. Uh-huh. The thing is we're... Oh, you've got a telescope over there. I'm probably like looking through the dorm windows across the way. I know who's right. Right. So what'd you see? Yeah. Well, anyway, we're looking through it. We can't see anything. Come to find out. You have to take a pot. The inside piece right near the eyepiece and there's a small grass reflector there. Uh-huh. And that came loose from the, um, from the glue that was holding it together. And then... Well, you know, it could happen. It could happen. It's similar. It's like an instructional call today because anybody else has the same bad experience. Exactly. You know, it's, uh... I mean, when you're really desperate and you've got it aimed just at the right window. There's always something really hot going on. And then all of a sudden you can't see a damn thing, right? Okay. I see we're coming from. Have a good day. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It was that like a nervous, fair well. Like we finally discovered while you're written. And nobody just runs around with a telescope. Well, we, we had brought it because of the, um, I know. I know. The alignment. You wanted to see a which one was on top. All right. What only happens if we're hunting this, you know? What? What only happens if we're 120 years? Right. That's what a lot of our callers say. Right. Yeah. Boy, who's he kidding? Four Loderdale. He's top of the, I'm up in the company. Oh, no. The old house to go on. Congratulations. Here you're making some serious progress by the end of Rick and Spudio out of the out of this. God for sick and stay. We've been a little bit less. I figured up a little bit. First I got blue there and then I got a question to the answer man. Yeah. I thought out with up on this is a real good one. Now, Gallup is that she cuts off four lanes of traffic to cut into a gas station. Get out of the pumps to fill up her car and old blue here. This is up in, in the company. So now, and she just leaves the car and gear gets out and the car just drives across the parking lot on its own a rat. That's just into a concrete wall. Stop it, hitting that and jump. Yeah. It was kind of, I stopped that. Great. But just stopped the watchers being kind of as it happened. Question for you. I'm planning a phenomenal trip. I'm going out to Vegas for five days over Labor Day. I'll lucky you. That's going to be the spot. Tell me something. What's good to eat out there? I know you've talked about it. And I'm going to keep listening to what he got some suggestions and trying to put some ideas together now. What's good to eat out there? What does that mean? What's good to eat out there? Caesar says a great Italian restaurant and Caesar's palace. I can never think of the name of it. One of the best Italian anywhere. The Rhapsody is a great to continental restaurant and they drop a canna. And if you find a bad restaurant out there, you'll be very surprised. Okay. I'll be listening to that.

Hello. Neil, play a bunch of your cards. We're going to waste that four minutes. Or maybe all the minutes. And don't talk to anybody. How's that? You don't want to do that. Don't you want to hear all these intelligent people? No. Come on. Aren't you getting the bang out of him? No. No. You know what? I went to the Chevrolet. Do you want to do it? Do you want to do it?

I figured out how the catch can win the pen. Oh, geez. I was feeling so good again. I was having a little bit of resurgence inside my body and now you're going to get me depressed. Oh, no. This is true. It's a little bit of a rest of the games with a giant. And the Houston. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And Montreal. Those are the three teams we can beat every now and then. Yeah. That's it. I was up there last week. It really feels. So the, um, sort of comes to take two out of three from the giant. Yeah. So what a fantastic place really feels. A lot of fun. So you know, that's the thing people understand. Even when we get the crap knocked out of us, which is often. It's still fun. And people here can't relate to that. I mean, I mean, I mean, my team, I, the giants were losing it. And actually, that had a great time to say. That is the fabulous. There's a drive. Where are we? My piano. Yeah. This first come where home. See, and we lost the game. But it was exciting. Oh, then to answer it, we had dinner the night of Tuesday at hearing Kerry's restaurant and two tables away. He should be there. But the great man himself. Yeah. He spent a lot of time there. And he was, um, as the evening went on, he was well into his, uh, his, his, his bedwiser. Or more and more. No, yeah. And he becomes redder and redder was an interesting phenomenon. Yeah. And, um, it was just really interesting. By the way, so many, I think it could call yesterday about going up there. They, they don't take reservations unless you have a group of eight, I believe. So if you, if you go there when you're there, anybody else, if you don't think a large group. Uh, we went there around eight o'clock and, and he told us that the front of two are wait, they got us in about an hour and ten minutes. Yeah. They're, they're a, I, I, I would don't want to generalize, but a lot of the really good restaurants, like scoosies up there that we have a tiny restaurant. They don't take reservations and usually have to wait about an hour. Yeah. And it's worth it though. No, you have an hours worth of memorabilia on the walls, all the different photos and the, and After you had another restaurant, I love is the palm down there right on the lake. Sure, boy, that palm is great. Stakes and lobster. Yeah. Great time and until that you have a great time when you go up there. And I guess maybe the giants will, we'll be able to, well, they'll finish 500 at best, but the, like I say, the bottom line is it doesn't really matter if they win or lose. Just having a great time. It's going on and relaxing it for getting your troubles for three hours. You've been getting out of this here. People do it in beginning in 93. Okay. Right. Thank you. There. See him. 142 at Wild.
