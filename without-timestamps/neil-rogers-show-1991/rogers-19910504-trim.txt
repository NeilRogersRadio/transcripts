Yes sir. Oh yeah, I just wanted to congratulate you. Glad to see you're finally understanding the mark is here and you're not acting quite so much like Dhumenter. What the hell are you talking about? Well you're reading tour up, right? My readings are almost always great sir. What are you trying to talk about? My mentor, who's my mentor? Alan Burke. Oh my mentor? Yeah. Yeah, right. What the hell are you talking about? Do you have any idea with a Sponi voice? What are you talking about? I was just talking about that. You don't remember what you got like marbles, kittens in your mouth or what? No, no, I'm not the moth's name. Huh? Okay. What the hell is he talking about? 1053 a WIOD my mentor. Oh, great. We have an overlided Pond Beach 655 WIOD. Here's a piggy port that I'm sure can't be there anymore. Oh hey! Big of a boat. Anyhow. Yeah. The feeding friends you know. And I said when he's finally going to drive, they're pointing their little things at you. When you come over the hill. Yeah, what are the... Don't answer the question. Hey. Yeah. How about some cups, buddy? Yeah, how about them? Hey. Today is this is D Day this weekend, sir. It's the turning point. Oh! Over 500 or under. And down the yonder the hill we go. Hey, yeah, I'm pretty happy to be there. I'm pretty psyched up for today. About what? We had a bunch of players going down to the keys about two o'clock for the whole weekend. Great. We rented a room. Once that we got about 13 guys. Yeah, we got to have a good time. Yeah, we should. What do you like pivot man? No, I bring up the rear. Okay. Good. Well, I hope you have a big weekend. 10 54 a WIOD. We have an open line in D Day 7519463. I hope you don't have any acupend girlfriend. 6559463. I think that's a terrible thing you said, George. That's it. What? What? Talk about an ethnic slur. Cuban women all have big butts. What? What a gross test. Most Cuban women. Yeah, right. How about Cuban guys? I don't think so. We'll talk about that next hour. Anyway, we started to say we had an opening in Dade 1 in Palm Beach. I think I already said that. Let's take a call from beautiful coconut creek. Okay. He's on all the lines now. Crossbring. Hello. Well, Neil, good morning to you. Yes, sir. That's an, uh, no, please, right. No, smooth. No, suckin' up. I'd like to hear the dirty hairy carry tape. Okay. Well, he direct answers. No chance. Two upper lines in Broward 524WIOD. Let's take a mobile in. Howlendale? Yes, Neil. Yes, sir. Thank God that there's only one more week of the natural ending lady. What's your problem with an out-slanding lady, sir? But at least you do have the balls to call us and tell it on the ear. I will give you that credit so far. I mean, I think more of your listeners would rather hear Gilbert. And he's terminal. No, sir. If you want to take a poll on that, it's not even close. Most of our people would rather be dead than hear Gilbert again. Did you notice how much of them already got to beat to the punch? The natural ending lady on sudden is a cup span now. What do you try to say? She can handle it. She's big enough to handle it. Believe me. What do you want to say? I just want to say that. I'll be very happy when he's off next week. But tell us why. Don't just say that. What is your problem with her? Because most of your listeners, I think, don't watch the show. No, follow it. Well, that's their problem. I don't give her that. Most of my listeners aren't cup fans either. Does that mean I'm going to not talk about it? But most of your listeners know what they're talking about when it comes to baseball. That's what you think. Don't fill these. Mitch Williams is number one. Okay. See that proves it. Good luck to you, sir. I know where you're coming from. Thank you. Saw our grapes. 1056, the W.I.O.D. John Cruck is God. Boy, what a big fat slab he is. But always kills the cubs. Just kills it. Everybody kills us. Guys, they hit like 100 against the league. It's 700 against the cubs. They're in Dalton. They can't get arrested. Kills the cubs. Here's a mobile in Miami. Come on. Come on. Turn that radio down. Let's get with it. Let's go. Let's get on the stick. Are you going to speak to us or not? Now they're not going to speak. They're just to play with or not. Oh, but line and date 751 W.I.O.D. Here's a lady in Miami. Hi. I have to tell you I don't have a guiding light. I've walked it. I don't want to thank God for this call. Now let's really get that last guy upset because I'm sure he don't watch that either. Okay. But listen. What are you calling me? The town's flat. Oh, she's a spoiled rich girl. Not the town's flat. She's a sleazebag. She's like, no, she's not. She was a couple of years ago. Now she's all burnt out looking. She looks worn out. Well, she's like a shop worn slut. Well, I think she's cute. I think it's a great story. Well, I'm not saying she's not cute relative. I mean, she's cuteer than Alex. There's no question about that. Even cuteer than Alex. Better. But no, it's getting good now. The thing with the earring under the bed. Oh, excellent. The best. The best. And this kid, a heart. Talk about a temper. Yeah. Boy, he's just ready to go off the deep end. Any second. Facti field is depends three times yesterday when he heard that the farm was near to any more. Somebody bought the farm. Yeah. That's going to be a good one. The whole thing was Samantha's out. Dude, good. I hate her. She makes, oh, she is so mousey and weakly. Just, oh, I mean, so now she had the operation. She got her legs back. I don't know. And she still walks around like, oh, everybody should feel sorry for me. It's a place to go. I got news for you. I'm going to even look at her. She ought to get on the ground and grovel and kisses toes. Am I right? That's true. You bet. She's not up late. She's, he's also a wimp though, too, you know. Yeah. No, how about Blake's up? Aw, I hate her. Oh, and she's great to hate. Yeah. She can tell she's Rogers' daughter. Oh, absolutely. And then what the hell happened to, what's her name all of a sudden? There's also become kind of a corralsy. What's your name? Yeah. What's her name? Rogers X-wife. Oh, my. Blake's mother. Holly. Holly. What's with her all of a sudden? Oh, I think it's great. That's good. She needs that. I think it's much up her image a little bit. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, she and Ross were kind of a boring pair. She's good with this, so Wimpy Doctor, she got it. Yeah. I didn't think he had it in, I mean, huh? No, I didn't think so. Well, I guess he did. But they killed off, or they rode out my favorite character. Josh. No, India. But India from the year. They killed her off? Well, they got rid of her. She came into town, caused some trouble and then broke that. Yeah, because she was kind of, she'll be back. I hope that she was back. She was back. Maybe she can come back and be Roger Thorpe in her next life. Yeah, good. Well, listen, today is going to be the episode of your lifetime, Trust Me. Yeah, no one waiting for it. Okay, take a couple of volume. I will. See you. Bye. Well, that's going to do it again if that board the Orioles fan. Too bad, okay? Cause we like guiding light and not slanting. And by the way, I caught about like three minutes of Bart Simpson Thursday night again. That is the most pathetic stupid show. It's okay for like four year old kids. And I noticed nobody else is talking about it. You notice how the blue is off the pansy now on that thing? What a piece of crap. That's just the fun for the feeble minders. Anyway speaking of feeble mind, Henry Burrow has the 11 o'clock news. We'll come back at 11.05. 2 to 6 this afternoon. Open the phone with old Rick and what is name? Sports top would Jim Manage tonight, fresh out of the shower. No hand gold, review M and FSU baseball, 650 tonight. And two man. So done. Bob Robb Bush. She and her partner tracking down the world's biggest bad guy. So bad. We're gonna do to that. You know Betty, decide when or once we catch him. Well, first I figure out she's that main jibalment to read. And then I was string him off. Yeah, she's a judge and jury in her own kangaroo court. It's hang them on starring Barbara Bush and Clint Eastwood. It looks like he's high tail in the towards the east. Slim, you and Debbie ride on the head and cut him off at literacy pass. Oh, she's got a date with a tall camel and a short roll. I'll be a bush in hang on the high. Hi, hoe Silverhead. Hi. I love my fear. Okay, it's 1107 and Wiodr number two. It's a tremendous Friday. Got the Derby tomorrow. We got Dave Johnson. Any minute, any second sometime. Hopefully. Probably shine. By the way, I have speaking of things that nobody cares about that turns off the audience. I have went through great effort to take to put on cart a couple of the great races. Both from 78 of course, the 78 Derby. And the 78 Belmont, which you could get the Derby of course with Dave Johnson and the Belmont, which the late chick Anderson, the 78 Belmont was the greatest race in the history of any kind of racing and if anybody disagrees, you're full of crap. How's that? For laying it right on a line with the firm than Aladar. Oh, man, that last mile. Or they just raced head and head nose to nose and that long stretch run at Belmont. Or Aladar stuck a nose in the front was the first time he had passed him out on a how long. In any race, just the nose and Velasquez inched over and cut off the room for steamy caught on the whip right handed and caught them went to the left hand and they came neck and neck nose to nose right down to the wire and a firm came back on the inside and wanted. God, anybody who even thinks they like horse racing has to get goose bumps. Yeah, well, we'll get to it later. Fort Lauderdale, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, Neil. Okay. What's up? What can we do for you, sir? Pardon me? I see you're off that speaker phone now or whatever you were on. Yeah, that was working. Good. So how are you doing? I'm doing okay. How are you doing? All right, just enjoying the show. You're on a collar. Well, Alad's pretty exciting. Yeah. Who's going to win the race tomorrow? Don't you care. I don't care. Well, that's good. Good. I like that. No beating around the bush. No pretending to be an expert when you don't know nothing about it, right? Like me. I know nothing. Yeah. Well, just like, you know, we're really enjoying the show. Thank you, sir. Have a great life. You too. Good. He's the first time collar. He didn't pretend he had something to talk about. Didn't try to be a smart ass. That was good. Don't do it again, though. We have an open line at Broward 524Wild in Palm Beach, where they're all busy handicrapping or at least part of that. 655-9463. 655, we don't care who wins. Here's a pig report. He said, are they gone? On a mobile? The collar is a little pig for you anyway, just because they're gone. Starlines open starild. Pemberg Pines. Good deal. Did Chuck say that guy kind of quit it, huh? No, Chuck didn't say anything. Was probably old Henry Burrow said. You know, I don't know. Like, well, I'm glad to see that. That's my call to both. Let me ask you a question. Sure. If they started televising executions when you watch it, and would you videotape it for like replaying at parties later on? I think I would. Yeah. Yeah. I don't know what I think it. I think it'd be a 906 year. I think there's no question about it. I think it would show a little more. Anyway. Yeah. How come there's no national league games? That's not so weird. Very unusual, very bizarre, but we sure needed the night off. Now that we only got like two pictures left. We need every day off we can get that was weird. And where's the old stock game, huh? This year, I don't have any idea. We had a last year. I don't know who gets lucky this year. I don't know. All right. And in this, nobody has this. The war's over no one cares anymore. There's a big rally going on for a freighter something happened. May 18th. Welcome back, freighter something. My company is going to be a major sponsor. I won't say the name. Yeah. So they announce it to me in today. You know, it'll not like, well, I'll show your support and all this stuff. They turn to this big sales mean. We'll get there. There'll be a lot of veterans you can sell this to. Oh, man. Just total. What a smart me, but you're crap. I'm sitting there. I'm ready to jump up and say something. Like, you know, why you turn this to sound unbelievable. That is one of the most disgusting things. I would have stood up right in the middle of meeting and shouted at the top of my lungs. Any other stuff? Yeah. And it did the same thing. I mean, when the worst started day after I didn't work, I mean, I was salesmen. I don't have to. I mean, I took off the whole day, glued to TV. I get this call, you know, why aren't you at work? Why aren't you doing that? What does the work going on? I mean, they can wait another day to be sold. It's just unbelievable how. Well, I hate to say this and there are people being upset by my saying it. And I know they did have 300,000 people for the short-scoff parade in Louisville today. At this time of the year, you can have 300,000 for a cockroach parade in Louisville. I mean, there's 80-bidded people up there. But all of that, you know, I know there are a lot of people who legitimately felt that way, and are very appreciative of all the troops and are glad that most of them are coming home safe and sound all that. But I think that a big percentage of that was just another ego trip in the Americans beating themselves on the chest and saying, We won and we're great and just another and so we're just, you know, back to the usual pathetic little lives. So that wasn't a big flag wave or when it started. I mean, I was kind of going to move in the world here. I didn't know. Yellow Ribbon said he'd be where it go crazy. But I think I was probably more sure where the moon was. So called flag wave or something. Anyway, that also is over. Yes, sir. Long with the U.N. family on a not-slanding. Okay. Okay. 12 minutes after 11 at WIOD, we have what open line in date. One in the Broward, 7519463 and date, 524. WIOD and Broward, if you care and if you don't, up yours. Two in the WIOD. I was just thinking, you know, not that George has told us that the Cuban guys like big butts so much. Now we know why man is so popular. We have an open line in date. County 7519463 751 WIOD. Miami. New. Yes, sir. Hey, have you seen my don, I didn't land in late together? Sir. Come on. Have you ever seen the not-slanding lady? No, I don't want to fear, man. Why not? What do you have against her? What would you like to have against her? Well, we'll talk about that later. Yeah, I bet you would. So what's that story about the Cuban women with big butts? Is there any truth? Well, yeah, I'm not Cuban. I'm the Groward. Well, you know, what's the thing in any way? So neighborhood. Yeah. Well, that's true, you know. It is. Yeah. And what is this about Latin guys out? You know, have a wife to raise their children. Have like a girlfriend or a boyfriend on the outside. Is that also true? Yeah. Yeah. More or less. All right, Neil. Have a great life. All right, you too. Okay. Well, we sure got some interesting answers. And he ran like a maniac. It's 11.16 at WIOD, probably at a day with his boyfriend. A 7519-463. And I want to play this thing. And I don't know whether it's, you know, a couple of minutes. Well, you get upset if we play this race call. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Oh, hi, how you doing? Okay. Um, well, you know, you're not particularly a met fan. No, that's the understander. Yeah. Okay. Well, I am. And the rear is on one play the other night. Yeah. Yeah. Exciting. Hotel. Enjoy that. But I want to find out that there's any truth to the road trade rumor last night. I heard some more on it. I think it was on the channel for news. He said something about Jeffries and, uh, and Magnin for, uh, Bonilla. I know they traded, they traded Jeffries and white good into the Cubs for, uh, Jerry Varshow. Yeah, you wish. What? It is true. Oh, what are you doing Andy? Andy is in here. He's in the toilet of a mediocre season. He knows you guys are fundamentally unsound. Other than a couple of good pictures, you're a crap team. I feel for you. No, but seriously, is it true? No, it's not true. Andy said no one he's the number one met fan in the USA. Hey, guy, that newscaster that sportscaster is a real pinhead. I can't believe he said that. Who was it, segretto? I don't know. He's always just laughing and Joe Black. Who's Black? Oh, a whole lot of people to be honest with. The newscaster, on, in fact, Andy said he lives in dies with them. That's why I'm dying on the hair. He's been saying it a lot lately. Uh, well, all right, can I call my boss a douchebag? Will you guys plan this weekend? Oh, I don't. I'm working. San Francisco, oh, man. Where's the, where's it in San Francisco? Oh, in New York. Wait till you guys go on the road. Somebody told me that they had the answer about like an 800 game road trip. Coming up very soon. And boy, you think you're dying over here now just wait. You know what a good road team you got. Yeah, right. Just like the cops were a 3 and 8 on the road so far we're doing it. Well, how would you the cops? Oh, yeah, we need it. All right, John and Dave, they both do specs. Have a good day. We're locked to you, sir. 1118 at WIOD, one open line in day, 751, one in Palm Beach 6559463 655 WIOD is he stalls around just in the rear case that if it could be our good friend and buddy and what are the great super starcy when you want to have your carts in the right place you don't have them. Well, I'm eye timing in life is always been in the wrong place in the wrong time right Dave. I'm aiming exactly that's everything. I nail. So how you doing Dave? Oh, pretty good today to suns out, but I don't know if people are talking about a muddy track for tomorrow which doesn't excite me. Oh, come on. Why are you starting pretty excited there? You know that I carted up. I got so excited because it's derby day tomorrow and I knew you were going to call us today and I've seen us. I carted up a couple of races here. To me, well, the 78 derby which is a good race, not a great one, but you called them the court. Inside there goes Raymond Arrow and a firm is right there in challenging the clean horses. Yeah, remember Raymond Arrow and Bobby Beard was a hundred years old? You know, that was my first derby arrow recall. I got them all and then I also have. I've the firm going out for the leads and judge at the Cadale radar as the way well on the inside. The late Chicagoson with a bellman I was standing for that's the greatest race in the history of mankind. It might be and just because the series was built on a rivalry of affirmed in Ali Darn who knows we could have another terrific rivalry this year. There are some good horses in this Kentucky derby. You know why Dave Johnson made so much money. He could pedal halivat to Arabians. Okay, man. If you're going to try to tell me we've got a great devout, you could be a could develop it would have to start tomorrow because it hasn't happened yet. Yeah.

Your voice keeps getting like an octave higher each second. You think? Pretty soon you're going to sound like the helium lady. The helium lady? Uh-huh. I'm a converted melee fan. Great. Yeah. I used to ride around with this guy that I work with. And he would force me to listen to it. I was like in his head. Well, anyway, the new architect guy came in to go with all the money. And was fucking up to page. And at the end of the show, we see him in the sack with not page Linda. Oh, who's doing it with everybody? Interesting. And Gary is trying to make up to what's your name with the broken arm and getting a horse and all the stuff. And Claudia says that they're horse and around.

And finally, Claudia brings the senator and Steven in and tells them both that she's really Steven's mother and who is the father. And Anne is out. And so well again. I guess it's going to hit the end. And then Anne's old Anne's boyfriend steals this. Goes through this elaborate scheme to steal this expensive cross from this collection that Summers got. And then she wakes up in the morning with a note and a rose and he's gone across what's worth enough and he's got to pay off his debts. And he's left. She's left there without a cheeseburger. She got nothing. Did you watch it last night? Of course. Of course. Pat Peterson. Pat Peterson had Linda pay him off for the condo. And she's screwed him out of 50 grand and he told her to get lost.

And that's basically it once in a while. It come back a little France in your pants. One-19, it does lower the guys, by the way. Speaking of France in your pants, where's Rick and Spud? Boy, they've been coming in later and later, and later, what's going on with those guys? Something real mysterious. Here's a lady in Davy. Hi, Neil. How you doing? I'm a first time caller, but I wanted to ask you about not planning, but I heard my answer. Well, I answered anything just to get that guy upset the good sly ball that called a couple of calls ago that was attacking our lovely friend and not slanting. That's right. I watched the whole thing until the last 10 minutes. I had to walk my friend home in the dark. Well, do you see the part about how Anne finally went in and said, I want the money. Now you saw that. Yep. And she spilled the beans. And then that was it. And then I walked out the door. Look out, Cheryl. Mike is coming up to her that end of the building. Look out. I think he's desperate. Neil, I want to do. Also, how about these horny guys in the office, huh? I have never. These bordeans, man. I'm trying to. What is it? I've got more than a bump on my chest. Well, that's a good start. You've met me before. Yeah, Alex is put her on a hole. Yeah, she says hold this. OK. And he said, OK. He's game. You know, Dave game, don't you? No. Look at that. He's even got a towel over his shoulder. Oh, that's a t-shirt or something. Oh, boy. He's there. Ripping off his pillow. Ripping his clothes on. Just about. Boy, why don't you go over to the zoo when animals do that? Like his grabbing his crotch, like Rosanne bar and heat in there. What a maniac. We need more guys like him in here. Now, what is it? Well, that was it. I just wanted to call an ask you would happen the last 10 minutes. No, well, you know, you're really interested. I told you, Linda was in a sack at the end. Everybody expected it to be page because this guy was like really. I didn't. I heard you say it was Linda. When she came in, she recognized him because they were old fall on top of each other from years ago, from five years ago. Okay. Linda's just, I mean, she's just on top of everybody. In fact, let's get Linda Ferregate in here. That'll keep my calm for a couple of minutes. She's ready for anything. Yep, she sure is. If it's breathing or even just barely breathing like the senator, she's ready. Just like me. Or of course, she does like to have his little money. She likes that too, so I guess that leaves all our guys. Right. Well, listen, have a great weekend and don't forget Big Finale next week. Big episode. I will miss that one. Okay, we'll do an hour on that just to piss that guy off. All right, let's do two. Okay. All right, Neil. See you. One, twenty two at Wiod to upper lines in Broward. Five, two, four, Pat Peterson is God. Five, two, four at Wiod will be right back. Okay, one, twenty six. Thank goodness. Somebody out there. We appreciate it. We thank you profusely. He's got a memory better than all of us put together. All fall down. Was the name of that movie? The year was 1962. With Warren Bady branded to Will the Angela landsbury Carl Maldon and Eva Marie's saying was also in on the waterfront with Marlon Brando, one of the great movies of our time. The guy in his film guide gives it one stinking lasi star. He's probably right about that. Look at the Broward lines. He also stopped up. Okay, look at that. That is pathetic. We don't care. Five, two, four at Wiod. The Broward, the young man, reveres his narrative well elder brother but determines to shoot him when he causes a girl's death. Another gallery of middle American failures, competently portrayed by a writer and actor is very practiced at this sort of thing. What about how that means? Director John Frankenheimer. The strange era of nostalgic Americana were the familiar is their Freudian grotesque says the New Yorker 1982. That was okay. There are reasons I like it because Brayne had to Will the Wizard. In 2017, a Wiod, we got two lines still open and Broward, 5, 2, 4, Wiod. Let's go to Kendall. Hello. Neil. And don't forget tonight as you heard in the spot, which is why I played that Hannibal lecture. The first movie is on Red Dragon, up your is yes sir. You're the best. I love you got bless you and questions pal. Okay. What open line and date? 751 and the still two and Broward, we reached the end of the road I guess. No more horse racing too much not sliding. I guess that's about it. We got like two, four, five calls and thirty two minutes to go. That'll never fly. So why do we just play the carts again that we have played it like so much? Or did I put away that Bill and Ted Zex? Well, we got to put that once more in only. Huh? Oh yeah, that'll kill a minute. And it'll kill a couple of minutes for me to find it. Oh god. Man, as you get older, it does take a lot longer to find it, you know? The story that rocked bomb each in the world. Uncle Ted did for awesome boxer shorts. Let's cruise our marks and ride with some babes. Excellent. Our money, women, and co-ding. Uncle Ted, dudes, let's use our extra-best names to impress these babes and do the wild things in the compound. No way, Bill. Just wait, Ted. Excellent. The rich, they're powerful. They like to swim naked. Well, you're gonna do Smith and Ted Kennedy in. Bill and Ted's extra-benture are two. The next genatelia. Excellent. Come and zoom into a dude of the U. Pretty next. Perfect. Excellent. The best, the best in history. 129 at WODC. Old Suts is in the building now where it is old Hot 105 T-shirt or whatever the hell it is. 10. Yeah, thanks a lot now. Aren't you gonna car in your phone or phone in your car? Well, we just got it. We just went through the whole thing and the book had only got one. One was he did you see it? Oh, three times. You never saw it. It was bizarre, but it was interesting. The car mold and it's always great. You kind of get fixated on the nose, but after he used to that, he was very good. And Warren, I don't even like Warren, but in that movie he was good. Because he was not the place to kind of Warren Bay that we always doing his hair and stuff like in Champo. And Brandon, the will, of course, speaks for himself, but he's not feeling to weld a thing. Well, I'm 30 at WOD, here's a mobile and plantation. Neil, yes sir. You showed it to his great chicken. It was a good friend of mine and listening to some of those taste brings back a lot of man. Can I tell you a very amazing thing? We're done with amazing to me. Check out how we talked to Dave Johnson today. Yeah. So, this was the WNW West back in 1970. Eight. It was my first year there in this spring of 1978. And just before that particular Belmont, I talked with Chick Anderson on the ear on the phone. And, you know, we talked about the race coming up and we thought we could have went. And then, when did he die? What year was it? Oh, it's been 10 years again. Yeah. So, just like a year or two later, he died. But he was excellent. He was very good. He got that contract to do all in New York. Right. Which was the highlight of his career. Right. And he really, really wanted to. And he had a, he was shaving and had a heart attack or something. Wasn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Just like, Bingo. How old was he? 45. Oh, man. Incredible. That's kind of a world. Very good. And then, of course, we went through this long dry spell. We had to put up with Marshall Cancid in New York for years after Dave Johnson was making too much money. We had to put up with Marshall Cancid. And he got that job because he was like, a little nepotism there, I guess. And he was probably the worst in history next to Ross Morton. And now, thank goodness we got durkin up there doing a tremendous job. Yeah, he's good. Excellent. That movie that's on tonight, the red dragon. Yeah. Not near as good as violence to the land. The book was as good. Yeah. But the movie isn't called. Well, the movie is kind. It's really very bizarre. I don't know how they're going to put that out without really chopping it up. It's going to be interesting to see how they do that. Yeah. Well, you know, they ruin movies anywhere. I don't know. They should do that. This is not going to be much left because there wasn't much there to begin with. Yeah. Well, they figure he's in our chopping everybody up here as well. Chop a little too. OK. Thanks a lot. I see. 132 a WIOD. It opened line on that big famous star line. If you have Bellsauce mobility star IoT. I think we ought to play white, white one, baby, one more time, too. Don't you? Well, God, it's 62 seconds long. What a perfect way to kill a minute. Don't you like that? I thought it was great. I thought it's the best thing I heard Ray Charles doing a long time. Miami. No. Yes sir. How's it going, guys? OK, sir. Listen, I'm leaning. Clear up something. Cuban women do have big butts. Yeah. What's the difference? You've got to have some to compliment that. Yeah. Biggie. Biggie, go. That's about it. You're talking to a guy who knows, believe me. Oh, really? Yeah. I've been around. Anyway, so I'm just trying to say, I have a little controversy here. My wife is going to see this. If you ever met that famous Jewish Cuban movie star, Mama Lushworth? I have a little controversy. So to speak. My wife is going to go see the Tippin' Del tonight. Yeah. And you know what? Your wife must be desperate. You must not have all what you're telling us, sir. It must be something missing in that relationship. We got to ask her. We got to ask her. You want to leave your loan with a baby and I don't think that's there. What are you saying? She's going to see the Tippin' Del's and leave you with a baby? Yeah. Yeah. I think that's going to be a good question. I'm going to do another lesson. I have a feeling, yeah. Anyway, I think you're going to have a feeling too, sir. She's a way of jacking hospital listening right now. So I like to call her a big Jewish bag. And I'm not staying home, darling. Okay. Go on, find some of a big buck Cuban woman out there. Okay, bye. Have a good time. I'm 33 here on the Big Butt Radio. We have an open line on the center square, 524Wild and Broward. I think that's a disgusting, grotesque awful thing to make those terrible generalizations that Cuban women all have gigantic rears. I think that is one of the most vulgar, probably true though. Miami Beach. Yeah. Yes, sir. Did you not have Charles C. Canty on as well last year, Durby Day? Correct. You did. I think the last couple years, Charles C. has been there with Dave, but I guess that orange here that Dave is developing kind of turns around. Dave Johnson is excellent. He is sensational, Durk, and I think now is at the top of his game. He's number one. Dave is right there, number two. But Dave doesn't need to see the thing about Dave. You can see anything because I always kid him about it, but he's made so much money that it's just a tremendous. He's excellent. But in earlier color alluded to racing cliche, fine answers. Yes, sir. And I would rather listen to and down the stretch take, 24 hours a day as opposed to this one. Can I do it for you? You ate it too. The one that I like best. I hear they come spinning out of the turn. Oh, Bill George Jeff, the worst. And in ego the size of Montana. I hate him. I mean, Phil's fault. And he's the job. Phil is doing it. Phil, by the way, is back. And I saw his that the races last night on sports channel from Gulfstream, the closing day. And he is at the peak of his game. I hope he's feeling as good as he sounds. He's going to great job. The great guy. Yeah, he's really, he's improved like 10,000 percent since he started. He calls races in college. We've lost Morton cannot see. Can't understand a word. He's got like, mush in his mouth. The thing with Ross Morton, if he makes a mistake, nobody ever knows because you can't understand what he's saying. He's that food terrible. Man hunter with the very tedious movies. Yeah, all. Yeah, very depressing and very dang. Yeah, dark, dank and depressing. So everybody at tune in. Let me make him forget about the depression. I talk about NBC. My favorite line was Bob Savage circling the field on the rail. That was always one of my favorite lines. Yeah, unfortunately, I haven't been down here long enough. I'm, thank you, sir. The gentleman just probably all these sound. If I thank you, profusely. Appreciate it. Phil and Ted Duckland venture. Who did that? Who did what? Is that ACN? No, that's a rock comedy network that I stole from Rick and Suds. And I'm proud of it. Great. Because like I said, Rick Riley plays those things one or two times. Then he throws the, then he loses it in the middle of the car rack here with all that other crap they threw in there. You never hear it again. So I'm doing a pubic service. I'm keeping their material alive. Although I will let him have the Duane stop back if they want that. I'll find it for him. I want the stop knocking and not planning lady. Yeah, leave her alone, okay? Isn't it nice? Right. And I don't even like not playing. In fact, our new boardup, Mike said he was she come over right now. He'd hop all over. He needs to butcher up a bit. He does. He's sure to. He's hopping all over Alex in the hallway. Listen, have a great weekend. And we'll talk tomorrow. Okay. I'm Gretel, I'm Sunday. And as they say in radio, Peter in the morning and the fever all night. That's what they used to say on the Peter John Show on WSPB in Sarasota. Peter in the morning and fever all night. Anyway, 24 till 2 at WIOD will be right back. Peter, I want to be a party. That was I want to be gay, but it's good to be. Anybody, I'm glad to be. Kids everywhere are playing the tragic new board game. 25 to life. Yes, 25 to life. The game that lets them go from behind the camera to behind bars. I think Joe, I got caught up in the field. Where did it go, Dave? My turn. Busted by no. No. No. Community, no Mr. Gay. Oh, you think let your child start, follow the twisted path around the Hollywood Game Board. On Christian Brando to Adam Rich until someone gets... 25 to 9. And is it enough? Oh no. Hey, here. You got caught holding up a promise to go to jail. You win. 25 to life. You from has been. It's all in batteries, not included. 141 at WIOD. Markets down 9.15 the Dow. Also want to thank that wonderful gentleman of broad in those sound effects because it was that quicker? Just call within the last hour. And he delivered. He brought a whole bunch of these great cassettes with all kinds of puking and farting and stuff out of it. It'll be great. See, I like somebody like that who promises and delivers. How many times has somebody said, I'm going to give it to you and then you fight out they don't? We can all relate to that, right? You're going to get it and you don't get it. And that's depressing and disappointing. It's a big let down. We got it. Cut the ridge. I need a hydrogen. Okay. The boat is standing in crime nearly here in copper. Well, there's got to be one. Even an explosion. This is unbelievable. I think sitting in the place today. Well, thank you. Hello, a very young girl. Gary Bruce, do you? All right. There's somebody actually who leaves that. This is two intriguing. I'm not going to mention the name. Okay. Well, just don't mention that one because we're having a good day so far. No. That was, you know. Okay. It's bringing back so many memories. My grandmother was right across the church around. And I can see the steeple from there from the porch. And just to the grave, it's just flooding back. Floating back. I've been flooding back. Maybe some depends might help. And it's even trying to other things I'm going to do in. I'd like to have you for lunch. I have your liver. Some fresh followings and a nice bottle of kiyaki. Uh-huh. But the next year we got to keep this going. I'm going to take a private picture to be found to the land. I held up a picture. How about my polakek? He could be them. Well, you're going to get pictures. Give me the day. It could get close to it. Yeah. But anyway. In closing. Then your money went into the mall. Okay. And the same to you. Okay. Back at you. Whatever. 143 at WIOD. I don't know what he's talking about. We have an open line in date. 751. WIOD. Let's go to Lantana if we must. Yes, we must. Good afternoon, Neil. Yes, sir. It made a good news viewer. That's right. This call has one of those Spanish women near the end. The big, but I don't like. I'm not going to say that about rearing a big family. It was a terrible line. Okay. I don't like not landing. And I don't like guiding life. Yeah. I'm not a horse racing guy. Right. But you're still out there, sir. But here it comes. That's right. I think listening to you all talk about it has added a little bit of interest to my day. And I hope it's brought your horizons. So to speak. So to speak. And I just wanted to let you have that parting shot. Well, that's great. You're a great American. Sure and obviously have no life. That's right. Thank you. Thank you, Neil. 144 at WIOD. We got the Derby tomorrow. We got baseball, CBS kind at 1255. The Martin say it was planned. That would be nice if we knew. But I guess I'm getting a little picky now, huh? CBS baseball. I don't think most people care which network it's coming from. They like to know who's playing. We got make green tomorrow morning. We got Dave Graveline. If you get up early tomorrow, we're apologizing for that already. We can make us. He used to be one hell of a show with Chuck Meyer. I hope you feel bad about it in the newsroom Chuck. People are killing themselves jumping off tops of tall buildings. People are resorting to incredible tactics now Saturday mornings. That's what they're doing. Those Mr. Graveline is all right. Good voice, no talent. No sense of humor. We got U.N. baseball tonight. Tomorrow night because it's a big three-game series of hurricanes and FSU. We got Mr. Cancie de 4th for the trees Sunday morning. I'm sure we'll analyze the Derby with his great expertise, which he knows nothing. And Yankee baseball Sunday night. We got like his usual whole bunch of sports and cramp. Four-laterdale. Dale. Yes, sir. Who's about to see the one? Yeah, I can tell. Bad radio sir. Wow. Listen, not all flat and women have big butts. Yeah. But it really doesn't matter. As long as the title has to camp or on, and the nails are done in the hair's nice. I mean, seriously. Nails have to be maroon, I think. No, these women, they take their cherry more about their hair and their nails, than everything else. I mean, you know, don't hit the treadmill whatever you do. Exactly. Listen, I think they've been more time prepping their breasts than their hair. They'd be a lot better shape. Seriously. I mean, we're in theory. Yeah. But anyway, Tom, Jackie, you started to say? Well, you know that one tape. You have nothing, make one. But the one about sales, people are Uranus. Yeah. Who won with Uncle Tom? Something like that. I think he is an Uncle Tom to be honest with him. I think he's playing little games with his column now to try to be cute. And I think that's a disservice to the public. And, you know, let me say this to you. The people who care about the ratings on this station, they're making an event because they get him because we give him out on the air. We give him a Mac and really anonymously. But as far as the readers of a newspaper, it was worse than a joke. It was in a disgrace. I mean, we're looking at the markets down 14 and a half. It is plunging, sir. Can you believe that? plunging. Taking a dive. That's right. Yes, sir. But, you know, you're so off-site. I mean, I know you don't care about boxing, but the, uh, fight recently with a George, uh, with four men in that he go, he called it. But the night before it says, are you can watch the laugh or of a fight? Turned out to be one of the better fights. You know, they're to be, you know, and, uh, the guys in joke. But I think one that liked that was that, uh, newspaper critics are apples. That would be a good one. That would be an actual one. We know that. We'll do it on Monday. One more thing. Do ask and you shall receive. We want two more little things. Two more little things. Markets down 15. No, oh, it's dropping man. Who won big? Grab it before it hits the floor. All right. Who does the bokeh song? What is it? The bokeh song? Who does that one? That's a brick and pods. I don't know. Is that what you call that one? That thing is great. I mean, I don't want you to play it. I know you want it. I don't know. I don't see. I don't play there songs. Okay. I might see a lot of the like butt load or something. I can drop it or some of the, uh, Iraq comedy that they're never going to play again. I'll ask him. I'll ask the, I didn't know. Whatever. What is it called? The, it's the bokeh song or whatever. It's like the tamarack on something. I don't know. Tell me about Rick Riley. If you're going to have stuff that's steelable, at least, you know, like he's got F and R and O and, and, and, you know, you can't find anything to steal it. Well, I know something is on mine. He has a good stuff. Yeah. Here's Carl Springs. Hey. Is that close enough? I'm not the bokeh song. It says we don't know. I know how long it is, but just, uh, you can't find it over here. Those guys, uh, all right, listen. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Maybe this will do it. Hold on a second. Yeah. Is that one of my favorites? Well, I really like that. It's like, pitiful. That was the William Shatter one. No, this is, but this beats William Shatter. At least he's got an excuse. He's from outer space. All right. One more thing, man. He's closing. Yes sir. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. Chiefs, man. He is a major. Wait a minute. Don't, don't do it, sir. I'm sorry. There we go. Barbeard for me. That's the old-irm material. But hey, it's to be questioned Friday. You're all right. Please sign. No, no, no. Well, that you will see people. See you. It's William, William. And that's what I like about Velka. A downway he goes on heaven's wall. A downway they say. Helpful. Hold on. Tell me, please. Come on. Is it Velka? How's it going on? That's what I want. He's about Velka. Okay. I'll cue it up. Look at that shirt. Are you spending a night? Look at that. It's like a nice box. Where the hell's Rick Riley? It's funny. Sox came in and said, we're one of those wild Hawaiian. That isn't Hawaiian. It's more like a simulon or something. So anyway, you were saying, we're playing my stuff. BS to you, sir. You know, I have a baseball trading cart. Yeah, BMW. Yeah, those two. We ought to have like an ACN and rock comedy trading cart. We'll get his trades and stuff. No. I want. So white one. I don't hear what you want. Yeah. And oh, when is white? Yeah. You see yesterday. I put on that quick or what? Yesterday I put on the pot smoking thing. And Marvin says, we've heard this enough already. And that was the first time I played it. I got news for it. If Marvin starts dictating what happens on your show like that bag. Get you head on a couple of days ago. Your guys will be history faster than you say. Greg is desperate. It's time. So white. You're the son of my late dad. I'm like about. Okay. You need like a typewriter. We need another machine up here. We need your right. Another other thing that I want. I asked for nothing because I avoid all management people at all costs. Two things that I want. That's all. I want a new mic cord in here so that every time you pick it up and you do like this, it doesn't clean you've had it. That makes all this like got a short knit or some crap. Oh, my cord cost him like five bucks for a long cord. All the way. I think which we had is cord style. But anyway, and then we need the triple that car player of it. That's it. That's all. Well, leave it alone. No. Yeah. For why? Because there's a lot of stuff that's out of it. I've got to have a cassette. That's the desk. Yeah. Why? This guy out there that won't go home already left all those cassettes. Oh, I heard. No, he did. He brought an 8 billion. He's good. They probably won't be here from 2 to 6. Huh? We'll go through those. Oh, what are you going to play him on? I don't know. I can set that. Get there. No, that's no fun. You got to play your own stuff. Get the white one, David. Yeah, I like that.
