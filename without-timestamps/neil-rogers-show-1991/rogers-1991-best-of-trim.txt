Now, the best of Neo with your host, Neo Rogers, a new dog with you. 610 WIOD. I'm now for the Game Show where politicians, questions and answers they came up with are in the past three years in E-Lexing, California. And now, here's your host, Alex. Two more people. This is the training today for final jeopardy is our Raining Champion George Bush. Are you ready to risk all you've earned so far, George? Yeah, I'm going for a bow. Sort of like the over-taxed middle class. Now, I'm right through your history. So, reason George Bush could lose in 1992. Ah, Jesus, 500, 700, and no, no, and bouncing. Quiet? No, I didn't think you were the first time in an hour. Well, it's round play. No, I got the nightmare on the session. Wait, I got it. All right, George, let's see what you got. No, no idea. One more question please. Oh, you mean like, why don't I have any new idea? Hey, just like I've got an audience, just decide to go to find out why. One, the world is working. Come on, let's go. One, this is the whole of the world. This is your new property. Here's the lady in the gables. Hello? Yes, man. Neil? Yes. Your favorite person? My favorite person? Yeah. Orlando, your voice is ch- No, I hope you know I met well with the deal. Neil. Was this Johnny Darcy's, sir? No, this is the animal rights person. The animal rights, you were not to use animal rights personally. That you were the viola lady. Let's check out, do with animal rights. Well, what does that mean animal rights? What does that mean? Just like they human rights or, you know, Well, since when do other animals have rights? Since they feel just like we do. No, that's what they feel that rhymes with veo and Neil. That's what I said, I said. This veo on a squeal. And I think we'll do a lot of issues. Veo, that's everybody going to have a veo Parmesan sandwich for lunch today. Meow. Horrors as a good one. Veo? I guess he took it personally, but anyway. I didn't want to get personally. I can find you. I just want you to know what I took it personally. No, you did not mean what? You're just a canniving bitch trying to tell everybody else what to do. No, no. I don't want to do not care for it. People try to tell me what to help it. I've never tried to tell you what to do. You told me you came right on the other hand. So I've got to change my attitude about this. You told me you must go. Change and everybody helped me. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. No, I didn't. I did. No, I didn't. Did. No, I didn't. No. Yep. Nope. No. See what I mean? It's true. No. Let's move on to something else because I'm not going to change my mind. I like viola. I'm going to keep eating it. I'm going to whatever I like. That's my business and you mind your own goddamn business. That's not what I want. Nothing illegal about buying viola. That's not why I can. I don't want to hear about all the poor baby cows. There are people out there dying on the streets. Sleep at the death of the mama. In your life. Have you ever heard anything like that in your life? Play, childish. You know, they're making difference. But I mean, twice you got it in there. And back at you, bitch. Boy, the most obnoxious, the most disgusting. No wonder she's into baby cow. Certainly nothing human would come close to her. God. That call was worse than the other one. Saladin, pebre pine. Hello there. Hi. I'm a long time list here of you. Well, that's great. I'm 83. I'll be there. I've got to be serious. I received a beautiful beautiful letter. I'm Harry Summerville. From who? Harry Summerville. A community. Oh. And I think I should read this over the air. No. Now everybody who would donate gets that. The rest of them don't want to hear about it. Because they're interested. Isn't that a damn shame? Yeah. It'd be crazy. Yeah, 95% of Mara very close to that lady who called before that to didn't get on the air about there. Yeah. Wasn't she a child? She was a... she was what you called her. Exactly. The first class did. Right. Exactly. Did you have to be subjected? And I am too. I think it's disgusting. There isn't enough money in the free world. That anybody should have to sit here and be subjected to cowardly people like her on the phone. Right. People who sit behind the anonymity of the telephone and act real bold and brave and spew mong all over the poor taco. It's sad. It is. It's sad. It's sad. It's sad. It's sad. It's sad. Well, honey. It's a beautiful letter and you got credit. W-I-O-D and you're odd. I get credit for nothing. I get blame for everything that goes wrong. I got credit for credit. I get credit. Well, I'm not talking about that. I'm talking about here. Well, everything bad that happens. I'm behind it. I'm responsible for it. I'm a part of it. I'm like, just a loose cannon. No, you just stay well. I was William Conrad would say a big loose cannon. You just stay well, honey. I'm 83. And I hope to live another. This is a... No, no, no. Another 110. Why do you sound pretty good for me? You just stay gay. Okay. You're just gay. Thank you. Bye-bye, mom. You're listening to the best of Rogers on news to our radio. 6-10-W-I-O-D. Some words. You're a six-as-head and here again just now in the middle of that traffic report. And, says to me, I thought you agreed. We weren't going to do the music. Now, then we take a little poll on this the other day. In formal poll, I'd like we talk to 4 million people and every one of them said we want the music on the traffic. See, the length of lift issue. We got these big numbers in here between 10 and 2. This particular book and of course I know the books are well full of crap, but nonetheless I'll take credit for it. I mean, it's like stands out. Like it just jumps out at you. Those enormous, enormous. How do you get an example, okay? Let's two-hour-one-horn here for a second. Okay? You probably used to that. Henry's used to tuning his own. Um, we're going to hell over the numbers. Here we are. Day parts. 9am to 10am. The weakest hour of the ringerary shows that 9 to 10 hour. I wonder why. 39. My 10 o'clock we got a 7-7. Then an 8-1-7-9-7-7 and a 2-6. So anyway, what I'm trying to say to you is obviously this audience wants the music behind the thing because it's entertaining. It's amusing. And now, boy Gary says that the traffic of the people are having a fit and they're just to go and nuts in there. But you're crying baby, this is what it is. And I think, you know, there's a certain time to draw the line in the sand and put your foot down and say I'm not going to whip out. And I'm not putting up with that crap. And like I said, if it's okay to have the drum beats behind the Tom Pashton George Michael whatever his name is at the 5-20 on channel 4, it's a little soft music. So about that level behind the traffic to just to kind of spice it up a little bit. Right? That's what I say. I could be wrong. But I think like I said, there's a time to draw the line in the sand and so let's once he starts muscling in here man, then more in trouble. Then it won't stop. Mesh which success. Scroll there traffic, okay? We can do better traffic taking the nut about 10-jow on a hat like they do the ratings. I'm not going to make a big issue out of the thing. I mean, you know, if the people are the guys, it's a traffic watch patrol. And not only that, then I get blamed for a day-grade line getting canned too, okay? That makes it even worse. I'm not going to blame for that. He gets fired because he didn't have my support. I have nothing to say about anything that goes on in his building. Even on this on my own show, I have no control over it. And he's got to mitigate it. Hust by to blame me for cannon grave lines as that takes some real big ones. I tell you that. Must have been sleeping with the elephant's last night in Stole of Perigiri. That's incredible. That I'm believable. He got fired because he didn't have my support all these months. How about the audience's support? Man, it's just unbelievable. No man, he's like a bird drop so big one on one of the upper level management people's car. It's my fault, okay? Because the bird was listening to this show and he came over to the building that gives a message. Up with the music down with the traffic, that's what I say. I mean, I just can't believe it. And it comes in here like all of it. Like this is a bulletin. I mean, we've been doing this for days now, okay? We had the one newscast that we knuckle under. And the audience said, when I put an up with this crap, we want our music. Don't we paid BMI and ask that big bucks every year so we can play music here on both of these important radio stations? So anyway, the music's gone. That's history. It's official now. They're putting their feet down man in clay and stone and granite. Your music has been stolen on the hourly traffic reports, okay? She can all call up Joe Brennan, Mike George Michael, Paxton, whatever his name is, Roberts. And tiny crews and all the others say, hi babies. Hi babies. Now I want to see when Channel 4 takes the drum beats off the news at 520. That's what I want to see, okay? How come they don't whip out a Channel 4? And kiss up to these guys with their inaccurate grotesque copy overrated embarrassing traffic reports. How come, how come that is? George. Uh, oh, excuse me. Oh, it's cheese. This place, I'm Tonya. This is see this is what happens. The book just, that's the first copy of the book. We actually have that the four hours on this show are like skyrocketing, gigantic. Almost enough to give you a little ego, which in this building is impossible. And then man, it's like, okay, let's put that thumb. Do we have under my thumb by the stones? Let's play that instead of the news at noon. We do have, is that in there? Suds brought in a double stone thing, but I have a feeling it's probably long gone. I don't see it. Uh, oh, there it is. No, be there. And that's the man, what a guy. Always like that, so it's a lot. But I bet you that's not on here. Under my thumb, there it is. It is on here. You have to play that lieu of the noon news where playing other my thumb. It's up to George. It's his choice. You're a choice, you're either pot up the news or the cassette deck. One of the other. I quit. Yeah, I mean, this is getting ridiculous. Now, it's like they're just, like somebody just opened up a gigantic, like a big dumpster. And they turned it upside down loaded with elephant droppings and just turned it upside down on our heads in here today. As a way of saying, thanks for the great job you're doing for us. There you go. Man, I feel like I'm covered with it from head to toe. Hmm, kind of interesting. Hey, listen, I'm going to knock a lot of it. They pay me enough. I'll do whatever they want. Let's go. I will. Whatever the hell they want. They want me to play Chinese polka's here for four hours every day. If they just keep the checks coming, no problem at all. Whatever you want, you got it. Disney. He does have it. You can see that. Look at his face. Here's a lady in Miami. Hello. Hi, Niel. How you doing? I'm doing well. I'm going to the track. I've never done this. I said, no, I just did joke. If you go to Pompano, don't sit in the dining room because Rao will put you next to a bunch of a lot of notches people. I think I'm too far away to go to Pompano for them in Miami. No, you're not. Why is that just go up 95? You're going to have to go up 95 and make a left and you're right there. Well, no, when I thought that Hayaleo is close and he is close, but unfortunately, it's not open at this time. So you can go there and see the flamingo is still doing it, but that's it. Can't lose any money there now. Well, that we actually can't get in. But both of them are no good. Okay, so if I was what I would like to come up to Pompano. We need your money. Post time 730, Monday through Saturday nights. We need your money. It's a lot of fun. Well, how long can you, how long? It's from 730 until when? So when do you want to leave? I did a close. The last race is about 1115, 1130. Okay. And if what I would like. But I mean, they don't like lock the door in lock you in. They would like to. I'm sure if they want to hug your money. But you can leave whenever you want. Like I did the other night. I'll give me an idea in terms of how much money I could. I don't want to spend lots of money. I want to bring a visiting guest up there. Right. And I don't know what money. Make reservation in the clubhouse. Call my good personal friend Ralph in the examhouse. Make reservation. Have a nice dinner up there. The food is good. Get the stir friday onion soup. How much did dinner gin with an orange? Well, maybe 1520 bucks. 20 bucks. Okay, so with the two of us that beer around $3.40. Right. How much should if I know absolutely? $2 a raise. You know for fun, you say for about seven eight races that be 15 bucks a piece. So that's like for less than 100 bucks you go have dinner in a good night. Okay. And in terms of the racing since I know nothing about that. That's the beer going to win just that just pick drivers, colors, the horses names and just bet like to show. If I like the way to show everybody, just bet two bucks to show. Then if they come in for a second or third, you can't make sure. Okay. Just pick a horse to show. Okay. Hey, won't get a lot back, but at least it'll give you a little something. Okay. I'll be a good introduction. Yeah. Just go right up 95 to the Atlantic Boulevard in Pompito Beach. You get off there, go left and you go to the to power line and you're right there at the track. And I can do this for the two of us for around $100. Less. I mean, depending I can't control how much you plunge if you get the fever and stucco and not still call me tomorrow. Oh, gee, that was nice. I can't help that. Oh, maybe I'll give anything if I would have been there last night. Man, Jeff Gregory with 90, but on Jeff Gregory, okay. Right. Jeff Gregory is God. Okay. Thank you very much. Okay. Good luck. Bye. She probably got up there and wouldn't like to try effective for $14,000 and I have to hear about it. My any beach. Yeah, hey, Neil. I got a fire report for you. Yes. I went across the street and had food at the wonderful Thai restaurant. You keep talking about. Yeah. And I was sitting at a table with my back to a man and a voice was real familiar. And you made a cross history here. I've already caught the street. I am by the bay. You right. And I heard this voice order a some young guy soup. And I turned around and it was Rick Sanchez. I believe it. He never stopped talking and he finished a whole bowl within 15 minutes and just never stopped. Yeah. Wow. You know, he's real original at Ricky Sanchez. Well, that's like he did the reason that he had to go with it. It's the only place in the area he could walk for lunch. They won't let him drive. Right. And he didn't even have a beer with dinner either. Annabelle, I wrecked your butcher up now. That's it. Thanks for the report. Okay. Thanks, Neil.

Oh, he didn't have his little channel 7 Skycam, did he? No, I think it's because we're kids. I'm sorry. You're so emotional. Yeah, it's funny. Every time a pedestrian walks up the car's way here like in front of channels 7 and I OD. He's six or seven out the window and sings that. He's the best. Really? Why do you tell you that? Well, I didn't really talk to him about it. I wasn't wanting maybe he might be listening. But how do you know that? You're talking about it. Why do you write? He hates me like poison.

Listen, I'm just calling you about I don't know if you remember yesterday as I called about parents. Oh yeah, he had that yellow thing. Right. He had a yellow thing. You know, if you probably worked in the Chinese restaurant. If you decide that you are going to get a bird. Who said I'm getting a bird? Where did that come from? Well, no, because you were talking about yesterday and you were pretty impressed with the way that the birds talked. That's only I'm going to get one. Well, nobody's going to say if you decided that she were going to get. Yeah. You could talk to your buddy, Keith. Okay. See, from the Sunshine Band, is a bird. He's a bird man. He's got like all kinds of birds. Absolutely. Yeah, he told me he's seen a bird or two in his time. I guess so. What he's in. I don't know what he meant by that, but I think I have a pretty good idea. Yeah, because his, I think Rick Reen is his manager or what his manager. Rick Reed. Rick Green. I don't know who that is. I think I'm not sure. I met him back in like 1979 or something like that at cable car. At what? At cable car. It's a cable car. It's a pet store. Oh, a pet store called cable car? Yeah. Why would you name a pet store? I have no idea. But they got a name of flower shop streetland. Right? I don't get it. That's something. You know, it would be like name in a sandwich shop subway. Yeah. Yeah. That's right. Now I understand. Okay. No, I got it. No, but I made him there with Rick, you're a buddy, Bill. I'm a little bit scared. Yeah. And they were there to get. Why do you say my buddy, why do you say that? Well, now that nobody's in this whole mess. Now everybody wants to like link me, but like my good close personal friend. Okay. My scene twice in my life. I'm being. I'm not that I'm trying to distance myself. You do understand. Although my food feed our moving rapidly. Right. Okay. All right. I, as I said, I was being defeated. Of course. Okay. But as I said, you know, I don't have any idea what you're talking about. You started out about getting the bird about Casey and the big bird and the yellow bird. Well, no, when now we're talking about Tanner and dancing your pants and I don't know what's going on. Casey's manager was at the cable car with Bill Tanner. Right. They were getting Casey. Well, don't be given that information. They were at the cable car with Bill Tanner. We're going to Casey the bird. Oh, this is getting worse by the minute. You may be you may have to give a deposition on his whole deal. Oh, that's a crap. Am I going to get one of your, your infamous letters? No, that's for sure. Okay. Well, listen, have a great day and they're happy bird to you. Okay. Thank you. Good bird is a happy bird. Absolutely. Thanks. Bye. That's what the scouting lady would say. I wonder if bird school. Do you think so? For a louder nail. Hey. How are you? All right. I just want to call on voice my opinion that I think the traffic. They think they thought I just down with them. Yeah. What they should. Why are you a cry baby? Exactly. They should be a cry baby. At least have something to stand behind. You know what I'm saying? They're trying to change the world. Right. They're like a bunch of a raimant there. Exactly. They're busy out there looking for Buddha. Right. On the highway. She pulled up to you. Can you just sit? Yeah. Two for the price of one. They didn't say that you could play music. They didn't say you could play anything else. Oh, you mean you should play the puking behind it. No, it's his five minutes. Now, boy Gary said that the news is his five minutes. Now, of course he doesn't realize all the times that certain people I don't want to mention he lane or Lisa's name went over the five minutes. So over the last three years they owe us about six and a half hours. He don't understand that. That's right. Because I've been keeping track. They owe us. They owe you a lot. You bet. They owe me their lives. Okay. And what do they do to respond? They don't need to go. They wouldn't even walk across the street. If this was a real class operation with this book that just came out today. Boy Gary would come in here and whip the three dollars out of his own stupid wallet and say, I'm going to go across and bring you back to the soup. Just as a way of showing that we do appreciate even as minimal as it is. I tried to write it to down. They should all be Pete. Yeah, right. I think for a great day. Good call. Not a good call. Great call. Somebody's got some kaho nice there. Not like certain people I know in this building. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Yeah, I don't know how you can say anything about this. I just hope you enjoyed this with that. About the what? The traffic report. Where's Thursday morning? I'm coming across five 95 traffic is beautiful. And they said there's an accident at five 90 five and a turn by deck. Yeah, there was no accident there. Of course. All of us. He didn't hear this morning. They were talking about the thing on allergy to rally and they had to yell a cop there and it was and then it's heard out there was nothing there either. But that all over the place. We'll break. Yeah, and there's an accident. I mean they told me about that accident three minutes before it happened. Yeah, that's the psyche. Look at that. And he just got you just cut himself off of your phone just died. Okay, and I could have told you that about like three seconds before it happened. There's a lady in four Lodderdale who would go get a soup, but she's not close enough. Yeah, you're right. Yeah, you would do it for us. You found nice. I'm here. Hi. With all this bird talk, I had this flashback. I had two birds like a year ago. Yeah. Not for very long. But two birds are not. Art rack is really doing it today. These two birds when you would hold them on your hands. Yeah. He would like drop down and he would like rub on you. And right here. So like he would look like he was doing this. You know, we had a bird here that's why we had a get rid of it. You were talking before the wood of birds. I don't know. What are you saying? Yeah. Well, it probably sounds like school, but not all the letters are the same. But in three more to me, that bird was so crazy. I hated them. Yeah, I've gotten a few lightweight, two to less couple years. I think you're my distance. There's just no easy and messy. And in a lot of mess, and then they flap around in that cage and they knock all the seeds and they're other dropping all around the living room or wherever you got a minute just to, you know, they're kind of useless. Almost, you had one of nice to appetizers sometime they're not too bad. I guess I had a scooby bird. Yeah. They all scoot and bird. Well, you have a great day. Next time a bird drops something in your hand, I wash it. I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I. You're hand too. And the great life. It's the best of Rogers. And this is news to our great heroes. 610 Wiod. It was a kind of an enormous sense of sight that I had a gay life. And I understood what gay sex was about. That you know, that it was, it was no about, you know, Fagerie at all. It was about violence, just savage renal, a lot of sense. I think one of the, uh, the things that stunned me when the record was released, but suddenly I realized that I found a female at all. Just by thinking honest about the fact that, you know, I, I have, I understand, you know, I understand how gay people feel. I understand an identity. And I know how it feels to be a woman. I know how feels to be a woman because I am a woman. You know, I won't be classified as just a man. In that book I made it clear. Who got the magic far? What the man is where I feel.

In the corner there it's the where the sea guy used to be and they used to be a kosher restaurant. It's been about 100 as a place called a kitchen glove. And I never knew what had a name. And all the punkty kids who can't squeeze in on South Beach at night. I guess the kids who are not fashionable enough to rest. And good looking enough to go down on South Beach. They all go in there and they like jam in there and they're like lined up. And they're like, oh, I don't know what goes on in there. But according to little joy probably will grab as. Hollywood.

Just have an all I'll just find any of Mr. Music. All right. Okay. I have all those green label cassettes in my house. Yeah. How'd you like those? I have a listen to him yet. Good. Don't. I save up all that stuff for my retirement. So in my dottering years. I could listen to this. Oh, listen to all this. Isn't this great? You know. Hey. I'm talking to you. I'm walking on it. Speaking of cable cars. Yes. I've got some of my car. You had an eel in my fish tank. You had an eel in your pants? Yeah. I called you during the trousers. I don't want to talk about eels and people with lizards. And snakes. I just I find that all just. I don't want to tell you. He takes. I don't he want he died. He died. I thought of my cable car. I just will pick one. You bought an eel in cable car and it died? Well, yeah. Now, both Hannah wasn't in there. What do you bought it was he? No. Good. You just have to be real careful with your water. You have to be careful with your eel. Yeah. Because if your eel gets into some bad stuff, man, it can die on you. Hey, listen. Is that right? That's a good lesson for all you punch out there. If your eel gets into any bad thing. Yeah. It can die right on the spot. You need to make a disclaimer right now. You don't mind. About? Every time I get a chance to call you, they let me off or I'm at home sick. And if you don't, you mean they let you off? I have a big job. And right now, obviously, I'm at home. So I called and said, good. And I'm not feeling too good. And I never come to call you. I get what he calls flat. And next day. You get flat. Yeah. I go back and I was like, go your rules. You sick to call. Where you get flat in the next day? Yeah. Because they're looking for you there. Yeah. You sick to call. So I am sick. Thank you very much. You almost stepped on Mick Jagger in the stone. You realize that. I say, I say, you never liked that song. You never liked under my thumb. It could be the best record they ever made. Why did you keep seeing his face? I do. You know. Boy, did I do a good job on that or what? Oh, boy. What do you mean you keep seeing his face? Mick's face. Oh, I don't want to see his face. I like the music. Yeah. No one to see is like we've got something to come. And lips. No, it does not. Maybe in your mind it does. Maybe that's why you're ill-buyed. Yeah. I was really broken up with it. I would imagine you sound like it. Well, while it was real broken up with it. I am. How much was it? Oh, let's see. Let's just turn to a 30 bucks. You went out and spent 30 bucks for a goddamn ill. Yeah, the big mori ill is really cool. It was eating other things in the tank, which I liked. You know, put a couple things in there. You know, they pided out and all that. Mr. Music. Mr. Davis, do you must program the ways that kind of goes? No, it's a distance. It's a one. The food chain. Yeah, that's right. As you need this. Speaking of birds, also, which is your topic I guess. Yeah, that's our topic that I bird talk. I've had two cognitials and I've had them for about five. I don't want to get in your personal life. They're right under cognitials. Yeah. I've got mixed. They're like a... Yeah, I know what they are. Okay. That's about seven years. And I'll be right on the start off with one of those. You know, they're nice. They're not hard to take care of it first. You know, if you like birds enough. What? A cock or two? Peel. Oh. They're not even very expensive. I have a line that is so good, but like I said, tomorrow's payday. Have a great day, Mr. Music. Hey, thank you all. No, go ahead. Call somebody at the... Sure, no problem. Uh, typically, E, and the manual. Who is the last one? The manual. No, thank you. They're all the best people. Amen. Thank you. Feel better. Feel this. I've said WI-O-G. All the music, all the time. Let's say it's a film. I don't care. That'll still those great robberies and they're a singer too, right? Let's change the format to long talk ups and make their lives miserable. Let's make a most they were never born. It's a matter of fact. Let's just take over the coast next door and place some really good music to somebody who wanted to hear something. Not bad. I thought that was pretty good. Here's the payphone and the falls. Nail. Yeah. I'm doing okay. Listen, um, is it related if I say asshole? No. I'm serious. Why? I like to call two people after all. Well, why do you want to do that? Well, because I think they're very close to you and you know the personal. Oh. Boy, you're a boy carry. Yeah. And Mike Disney. Oh. Big jerk asshole. Uh-huh. Okay. I can't believe what they're doing to your radio show. Exactly. They're messing with my life. That's my opinion. I'm Mike Disney. I'm not going to take it anymore. Right. I mean, going there and they pull the cards out. When it comes to coming and pull it out. They tell you what to play. Right. I mean, that card. I mean, they go there and they pull the trousers out. Cut. I was like, oh, no. No. No. You need to be wrong with that card. Right. You know, and then they start talking. You can't play music. I'm going to trash. Right. What will be next? And then we can't have any sample in a studio. You know, I know eating on the ear. And I just really can't. No phone calls. No phone calls. No music. No cards. No microphone. No. No. See the what they're trying to do is they're trying to knock. Don't you understand they're trying to knock my numbers down. I made my bonus again by a while and they don't like that. See, when we originally wrote the contract, the bonus thing was set of the numbers. So high, they thought they were wise guys. They figured no way in the world. He's ever going to break a seven year 20 out of 50. It just isn't done on an AM station. So they put a ridiculous and now I keep breaking it all the time. So you have to pay me these big bucks. And they don't like that. Wow. So they're going to do everything in their power to screw up the show. So everybody stops listening. They want they only want 35 to 100. Basically, they want people over the age of death listening because that's safe. They're traffic reports sucks. Right. And they're such an investment. They think that the audience has an IQ of minus infinity. They do realize. That's why they have to. So real, these are the same jerks that do the traffic reports for life. Right. For Waxy and they're just screwed up on those stages. They're just screwed up on those stages. And it's like, you know, they make believe like it's their WIOD traffic report. Yeah. Like they're fooling somebody. Like the thing with Mike Robertson, Tom Paxkin, and Tom Robertson, my pass. Like he's fool like he's making our chain like we're so stupid that we don't know what's the same guy, right? Listen, by the way, I meant I wanted this awesome mission. I went by way to minute. I didn't want you to have an action. Okay. I don't want to step on this lips. The arm is tongue. Listen. I went in the outback steakhouse over here by the fall. It's open. Yes. And I went by the air. I didn't eat yet. You know, get paid first. Get that walk about Superman. Now what's going to ask you, what is in there? Because I grabbed a gallon of those manys and little chick out manys. Well, you don't have a got the name. When you look in there, you see things that walk about. No, it's just a joke. No, there's, you like cheese soup. Yes. You like onion soup. It all depends what's, it just, it's just onions and spices and all that. Onion and cheese. Oh, it's so good. I'm telling you. Oh, wow. I'm serious. It's creamy and it's real thick and it's, uh, you'll die. You'll wish you had found this years ago. Oh, well, listen. I like to make another version of that, uh, a bayonet or an apunta. Yeah, watch yourself. Okay. No. And it is just, it still is Spanish, but it goes this way. You ready? Angle mocho bayonet or an apunta. Which means I have a lot of chicken and look. Yeah, that's okay. That's all right. And like I set up George, Mark that down. We're going to, you'll be, you'll be a star now. And you can mark this one down too. Yeah. Okay. Right, uh, boy Gary, it's not just an asshole. He's a phenomenon. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. Have a great life. Okay. The best of Rogers continues in minutes. News.
