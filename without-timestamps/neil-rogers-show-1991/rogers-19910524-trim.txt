Yes, sir. Yes. I couldn't warn you that I'm going to talk to you about the figures. About words and boats that you talked about earlier. About what? figures, cars and boats. Now we're talking about bridges over the causeway, not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any of my friends. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Calm down, sir. They could be planned. Daddy. First of all, you're regulated by the United Corps of Engineers. You've got to give. No. Well, it is. All bridges over the Navigable Waterway. See if I knew that I wouldn't have been asking, sir. But that? I said if I knew the answer to the question I wouldn't have asked it in the first place. Okay. Well, I'm saying sir. Here's that P9 estate Corps of Engineers. Are the ones that regulate bridges over Navigable Waterways? Over one? Navigable Waterway. Yes, sir. Okay. Okay. So it's up to them to decide what time the bridges should not be open to. Two. The Marine traffic. Yes. And what time should they not be open to Marine traffic, sir? I'm telling you that they come up with a time. Well, what is the time? I'm relieved. It's at wish hour times, sir. That they are not open to Marine traffic. Other than that, they are open to Marine traffic. So in other words, any slump of the boat can come along and back up traffic for two months. I'm absolutely correct. Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crap is that? That is not a communist bunch of facts. Sounds like some kind of being with all things. This tiny pickle, uh, I'm seriously going to be. It will be also one boat. Right. Exactly. The boat is going to stop for 5,000 cars. Got it? No. I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one Jack-Ansain is boat. I think that's what they ought to do. Thank you, but I know your law is Mr. Because you should go. That's right. I suppose you want that they have bridges closed. To North London to the heart can do. I want the bridges closed period. Okay. I want them closed. I want the bridge tended to go home and watch the MTV and get the hell out of our lives. I want those bridges closed. Let them use the Julia Tuttle, okay? You know, let them use the McCarticle Clausewood. I think they all are going to George Washington and Bridgen jump all of bridge tenders. How do you like that, sir? Well, I don't know about you, but you sound like some stupid idiotic champion. Well, I don't know about you, but you sound like some stupid idiotic champion. I'm stupid idiotic. I'm stupid, stupid, stupid idiotic. I'm stupid idiotic. Miami, hello. Oh, you caught me changing ears. Well, excuse me. Sorry, one of my ears, so I'm going to get you a lane-etter changing noses. Well, I'm one of those closet nearly as I can. I'll see. I drag you out of the closet. Come out. Come out wherever you are. When clients come into my office, I lower the radio. I don't want them to hear what I'm listening to. When your clients come in, you lower it. The radio. That is. Listen, people are talking about the morning show. They're at the radio station, but I think it's more of the best ones. Because, you hear SM in the morning, it's like dead. I used to listen to SM in the morning no more. It is so dead. It is unreal. Yeah. I don't know what's going on. Like, I don't hear anymore Nelson. Would you play enough Nelson? You know, everybody that calls here, today, you want something? I never, this is right my call. It's your first call. Why are you laughing at the box? Me all. It's my first call. I never asked you for anything. It doesn't have to be right now. It can be at your convenience. I'm continuing to listen to it. Well, I'm looking for it. Huh? I'm looking for it. You know, don't strain yourself. I don't want you to strain yourself. What if I found it, my might? Sting your phone? Yeah, if I found Nelson, oh, it's way at a bottom. Don't fall off of now. You're no timer. I got it. You know what it is when you break bombs when you're old. Yeah, I sure do. When you're old and crinkly. I'll be honest with it. They're getting kind of cd anyway. The Nelson's, you know what? Right. I think it's a little cd. I don't think so. I don't know. I don't hear, you know. I got their cd right here. I do too. I have it at home. I have the cd, but I don't have a cd player. So I go to a deal. Oh, thank you. Boy, that dude, boy. That's it. Wow. Wow. It's not like getting emotional experience there. Yeah. It was very simplistic. Okay. Well, have a good weekend. Okay. Well, listen, crank it up and just the blerid and all their faces.

Well, my husband has an unbelievable sticker on his car. Yeah. And we're up in Boka at the town center eating and this guy walks by and he says, What are you doing with that sticker on your car? You said you're jerk and you started calling all these names. Let me ask you a question. How did he know it was your car that had the sticker on it? We're walking to it. You know why I see it? He was just hanging out in the parking lot. Yeah. He was like, I don't know. He was like, you know, one of these people would go to the public. He pushes the car. How old was he about 110? Yeah, but he was angry. Well, they were all angry here. Everybody who came here is really like a dead town. Everybody comes here and see they're like a serial killer or angry or running from something. Anyway, so my husband has been trying to be a lot of brand flakes. Yeah. That's true. But it was really cool because you know, I had just started listening to you and I was like, You know, standing there like, why are you talking about Neil? You know, it was kind of cute. Well, what the hell is it his business in the prison? I know what his business is. That's the point. That's what I would have told him. Mind you, wrong stupid business. You're a fart. You're disgusting. Jerry, I drink ball a crap. I know that they walked a parking lot. They have nothing to do. I want to ask you a question about, Did you hear on the news today about, They're talking about the grace disease that they diagnosed president bushware. No. Well, they diagnosed him with grace disease, Which is the same thing as life has. Right. Okay. Well, they're talking about now that it might be coming from the White House Plumbing. Are you serious? I don't know. They said that if the plumbing's really old, It could be causing like immunological problems, And of course, the enclave has kids under 16. And that's who it hits first. I don't know if it really could surprise that, But they said the plumbing's really old and it could cause they're looking into that. Isn't that weird? That is strange. I know George Washington had a lot of problems with his plumbing. What do people got here? Problems with this plumbing. Yeah. And teeth problems, too. Oh, yeah. Yeah. They kind of wouldn't look all the time. So what are you going to do this weekend, you? I'm working Monday, so I'm not going anywhere this weekend. I'm going to pump it apart tomorrow night for the quarter horses. And that's about it. When they make you work on Monday, they screw up your whole weekend. I want to make it sound like sour grapes, even though it is. Well, I have a great show in you. I think it's like that you don't take yourself seriously. We got to called up about the boat where he was ready to have a heart attack. Yeah. Well, that's the bread. He's one of those old parts from Boca with a boat. Yeah. He says 50,000 cars should stop for the one boat. Right. What he's trying to say is they should stop for a hand because he's the disgusting, grotesque old fart. And he doesn't give a crap about anybody. Well, Neil, I think you're great. And I got to have something positive and sourced for our This, I think, it's you. Thank you. Hang in there. Have a wonderful life. Wasn't she nice? Man. She was great. Although there are those in the audience, they don't like to hear that kind of call. And now for the second. Okay. All right. I'm sorry. They should all be angry and hostile. You're right. Let's take a call from North Miami. Hello. Good day. Good day. Nice talking to you. Well, I got a little spy. I don't know if you're aware of it. But I saw Alan the Dean Berk on the morning down the Junior show recently. What do you mean on the morning down the Junior show? He's no, then have a show. You mean the one on CNBC that's getting canceled was the on that show? Well, I thought that was interesting. Yeah. What's going on? Sounds like we're going to lose you any second, sir. I've been laughing a lot with your show today. Sounds like you're going to hopper than you pulled it out. Then I pulled it out. Right. Well, I would, I'd laugh at that, too, believe me. What about the end by me by Benny King? What about it? Well, yeah. You know, you sound pathetic enough, I just might. Is it was that like the strategy? I'm doesn't know. Well, it works. Okay. I might just do it. He sounds so man, oh, man, depressed and desperate. I think he woke up this morning. Looked around and discovered where he was. I would do it for me. 1243 a WIO D. If we just played all the requests we got that would kill the next hour. And according to, by the way, don't forget we lucked out hurricanes. Kick Portland's last last night, 13 to 1 in a regional. It wasn't last night. It was yesterday afternoon, but it's embarrassing to admit that because we didn't care it. And so they aren't going to play in the losers bracket, which would be another afternoon game we wouldn't carry. So we got real lucky. They won and that means we will carry it because it starts at 630. We'll have the pre game at 620. Speaking of comatose, Joseph Aki will be there with Sunny. Here's a, I wonder, Sunny every now and then reaches over and like kicks Joe. You know, like in a horse and hardest racing, where we now and then the driver reaches out and kicks the horse to try to make him wake him up. When he's making a big move, either way Kevin Wallace want to race at Hazel Park Wednesday night. It's a miracle. Let's go to a lady in Palm Beach, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, man. Hi, Neil. How you doing? Good. How are you? All the ladies are just flinging that closet door open today and coming forward and standing up to be counted. This is true. I'm, I just heard the thing too about a week ago. A week ago. Yeah. Are you serious? Where the hell have you been all our lives? Well, I've been listening to FM. Oh, God. FM is so bad here. Yeah, I know. But, you know, mostly because I've listened to actually, I don't care. I can't stand the radio stations. But, um, well, how's it been so far? Oh, it's been great. Actually, I was going to actually play burp and there's a mall sitting on the hole. I heard it. Well, I have a psychic thing, you know. Oh, God, you kill me. You are killing me. But, um, anyway, I want to make comment about the guy with the boats and stuff. Yeah. I think they should just make the bridges bigger. That's what that's what my dentist said. I think that's all the problems. Yeah. How come, well, in Europe and Palm Beach, right? Yeah. Well, how come we have some bridges like down here. We have the McCartwan on McCarthy's got a bridge on it. Like the Judith Tuddle Causeway. Uh-huh. And they don't have any bridge on it because they build it high enough so that even the tallest of boats, even the Queen Mary can flip under there. I was exactly, well, like the Lake Worth Bridge, don't have to Lake Worth Beach. Yeah. The thing so high, it never goes up. Exactly. And then the one going into Palm Beach, it's so short because it goes up for a little robot. Yeah. You know, it drives me nuts. But anyway, um, I just want to say. Well, you know, we have so many pathetic, uh, geriatric old Farts, so many impotent old Farts here. They wanted to build something in this town that would go up once in a while. Ha ha ha. This is true. This is true. Um, I just wanted to call until you have a great, I think you are. Well, thank you, man. You're just getting compliments all day to the north of the fucking. Okay. Okay. We'll cut it up. Have a great holiday. Okay. So, can I call a couple of people do speck? Sure. Okay. I want to call Bob Bartley a douche bag and Kathy Creel a douche bag. Jim Ferguson a douche bag and especially Dave Hartman a douche bag. Okay. Have a good one. See you. See you. Boy, the closet door is just, uh, working it's way open. Um, and they're all pouring out. When it does pour it out, here's a lady in Miami. Hi, New York. Hi. First time calling. Great. I'm a leader in this spring for eight years, first time calling. I'm a slow, like most people here. I just thought I'd give you a little chuckle. You know that journalist, Mr. Harald, oh? Oh, yeah. They're great journalists. You know, he has to do it. I can hardly wait. Did you say broken six? Oh, geez. Oh, I know. I just thought I'd give you a chuckle. Oh, God. I hate to think what they're going to be doing with those came to today. Have a nice evening to those. Okay, you too. Bye. Who are the one that you just admitted? Okay, you're just, you're just jealous of Al Goldstein. That's what it's all about. We have an open line in Dave County, 7519463, 75 is Laura gone for the day or something. She gone? Because I want to do something with that card. I did that spot. Much to my secret and dismay that I didn't want to do to make Jeff Clark happy since he's such a miserable creep. And I guess we could put it in there. I'll give it to him during the newsbreak. See what we're going to do with it. I don't like putting stuff in there because I don't want to mess up their beautiful cards. Highland Beach. Hey Neil, how you doing? Okay. We think that Abelie was pointing out when he got thrown out of the game the other night. He had a giant blugger on his nose and he kept saying to the, the empire here, jump on this bell. He got him left and before he got thrown out. Which empire is that that's, uh, Ripley, Steve Ripley? He didn't look like he was taking it. And I think he kept telling him, believe it or not. But you see that look of disbelief on his face too, like, what are you saying? Did you see that was really interesting? I think I'm Ripley, but he was here. Yeah. I like Alta Bully. Yeah, I thought he could have done a good job. But he's no gym ass. You and man, this guy, he's a Mr. Rob Rye. He's up and down, pacing that dug up, clapping his hands, waving his cap. He's okay. He's 40 years young. Yeah. He looks about 60 by the way. 60. Neil, uh, live around Boca, a tone. And I don't think I've ever spoke to anybody. He's ever got a book from Warbetron. Yeah. Well, this last trend where I'm going to personally conduct an investigation. I'm hiring Don Corleo and Junior and look at Brotsie. We're going to find out what the hell is going on over. I think Luca passes him out. I think where they put the where they get, in fact, I'd like to talk to somebody who's ever had one and find out where they mail them to because they don't mail them to Beltsville. They mail them to somewhere here. I've never seen one. And then somebody here in some computer place gets their hands on them. And they feed the, they feed it into a computer here. And then it goes up to Beltsville and they do the final, whatever they do with it up there. They don't know. They sit on it and stop it around. But Neil, I got one more question. Now, because I remember when the birch report when I was on INZ at night. Yeah. And we discovered that the birch report, which does there things by phone and also on WS News. I had these gigantic numbers in Arbitron and birch was always like very low. And we discovered that there were a bunch of Cuban high school girls who used to do the research and make the phone calls. Yeah. And like if somebody because naturally my name for many years has been like poison in certain segments of the Cuban community, they would mention my name. They wouldn't put it down or they'd put some other station. Yeah. So these tend to be some very bizarre. In other words, when you're whole livelihood is in the hands of a few very peculiar people, you have to start wondering, you know? Funny name, Arbitron. Yeah. Some got a sinister in it. I got a friend of mine who's going to meet withdrawals major morning. And you're getting a lot of women calling you today. I think that's wonderful. Maybe they could give them some hints. You've been handsome. What? I don't know. I mean, I'm afraid to jog in front of them. I don't know what to do with them. What is this problem? Does it have a life? How do you do this? Guys, it's a good looking guy. He needs to have some encouragement. The lady was a policeman. He said, send him over right now. Okay. She'll take care of him. Oh, she needs to. Yeah. Including Davidson. You know what you are. Okay. See. Lansing's in coming. Just sit on my nose. Just the nose. I don't know he's gone. Hey, listen. He's breathing. That's young enough for you. And listen. Pay no attention to what Fat Ritz says. I think your nose looks fine. Okay. And spot a what this Fat Slop said. He's a good one to talk. Okay. With a shnaz to size of the Brooklyn Bridge. He's a good one to be talking. No, but the fucking. It's the water to two hours. Are you calling to Scarborough Fatt? The music of the sixties. Parsley sage rose Mary and haunting melodies. Timeless lyrics. The music. A generation march too. Amen. But now it's music. You can break the inch too. Oh. Going too. Scarborough. We're fair. Mama. Parsley sage. We're not. Take it out. Yes. Crapco records. Set the storm to the sixties. To the feet of the street. Imagine the music of Judy Collins. And the wrapping of Curtis Sloan. Well, I've looked at life from both sides now. From up and down. And still somehow. It's life's illusion. Check it out. That I recall. I already don't know life at all. Check it out. Check it out. Catch it out. Catch it all. The day the board morning. Incredible. Well record check. Craping on the sixties. From track out. Here's a fat boy's doing Dylan. Hey. Mr. Tamarine. Play your jam for me. In the jingo jango morning.

Do you know what we haven't done today? Oh, well, I'll get to it in a second. We didn't hear any Larry Lujac today. Or that WLS jingle. How now we have a day without that? Right, Ron? Okay. Yeah. It will rise to everybody. I'll send you your books last night after last night's vet camp. Okay. Perfect. Okay. Let's dedicate that to Hugh B. Brooks and all the men's friends. Now, how come I punched up cut number 15 on here? It says it's an error. I don't get it. How the hell is that possible? Did I put the wrong CD in a machine? Is it the wrong CD in a thing here? Let's see. I don't get it. We have a real. We've got another CD problem here. Everything's been going so damn well. It's his error. What's going on with this thing here? Do you hear anything? That's the wrong one. That's the wrong disk. Get a wrong thing. Okay. That explains it. Okay. It's one o'clock. Let's go to Miramar. Hello. Hi, Neil. How you doing? My brother works for arbitron of the theft of them. He's been there for six years. I asked him about a year ago. He ever heard of Neil Rogers. He said, listen to you for about three years. Yeah. He said, no. And I couldn't believe it. Because he calls Miami twice a week. Yeah. Anyway, I just want to call Frank Robinson, a douchebag, and the real fuck. Well, you're right about both, sir. Thank you very much. Okay. Isn't that interesting? Well, there must be something on here. I can cue up. Damn it. I got to do this once. I just can't get through the whole day. Sometimes. Well, there's nothing on this. See, do that to anybody for one here again. This is a bubble gum, see, the green tamarine, Simon says. And then, of course, Cheryl's favorite. Okay. Why don't I in a WIO deal? Let's go to West Palm Beach. Hello. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Well, I was going to start out by talking about a couple of Jack Nicholson movies. But first, for the next 54 seconds, we at IOT will bring you an important message about your toilet. First, I'll punch the ball. If you wish to fly a shiny object, that's okay. Moving along, sir. Let's get with it. Down. You will notice that there's a tap. One ten to WIO deal. We have an over-lighted Palm Beach. We just don't have time for amateur comedy. They call up Eric Lambert, see if it flies by him. Whatever happened to them, by the way. Talk about flashing a pan. Two live Jews. Boy, oh, boy. Somebody took their, uh, moths of balls away, I guess. Or just anyway, it's 655 9463. Boy, look at that. Adams got a big smile out there. It must mean that Cheryl went home for the long holiday weekend. And it isn't harassing him in the hallway anymore. Boy, what a sigh of relief. Really, she's been just a following him up and down a hall she is so hot for that kid. You would have never seen anything like it. The transformation in her and, uh, man, people are talking about all over the building. Seriously. She was fondling him in the production room there for a while. Got a couple of interesting country and western song titles in the mail. Oh, yeah. Don't cut any wood, baby, because I'll be coming home with a load. Haha. Now I feel better. I feel better. Now the show can continue 115 at WIOD. You're not your enemy. OK, he'll be broke special air for you. West Palm Beach. Dale, yes sir. Can we get a little older on these arms? Oh, I'm sorry. You're about 1840. You're an ancient buddy. Yeah, I know. Yeah, it's true. OK, nice hearing from you. Mr. Drogannick. You know that was, don't you? You're a good pal. Mr. Ropa Dope without the rope. What open line and Broward 524WIOD, you're a Palm Beach in a Starline. Dale, yeah. How you doing? I'm doing it. This is what a question. There's a lot of questions today. The reason why I've been home in was to talk to you about Larry Lugieck. Really? And WIOD, and I'm sitting down home listening to these great jingles. Oh, I caught you a couple of weeks ago. It was just that one bit that you played night. Guess what it was? It was a story, Lugieck and all that night. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That brings back unbelievable memories. I, my brother still lives in Chicago and I told him to go through a bunch of old albums. And I came up with one of these animal story albums and he sent it down to me. Well, where the hell is it? Everybody, everybody keeps promise me about that. Oh, no, no. I got the guy who was sending me the Bob Prince stuff. I still haven't seen it. There's another guy with Larry Lugieck animal list story thing, which I haven't seen. That's, that's like I got the volume three. And it was, uh, I think it was like 80's one. Hello, Tommy. Here's a couple of country and western song titles that some people made up. You can put me in jail and throw away the key, but you can't keep my face from breaking out. She smoked during instead of afterwards. Wow. That was exciting. Doesn't that do it for you? Doesn't it? There's that said a ripple of excitement throughout your, uh, discussion. That's interesting. Rose body. It's a sure does. Yeah. I do you guys, because I haven't any kind of remote anywhere in your future or anything. Yes, sir, we're doing another miracle. I'm so glad you asked on Friday June 14th, it's Veterans Day and WID in the Miracle, Salute's All of Veterans. It's going to be, uh, big, big night. I'll bring it there that night. Fifty cents admission for all the P.ons and free admission for all the veterans and their families. And we're looking to pack that place. Find out if we still have an audience. It's Friday June 14th at the Miracle. And we hope it's just tremendous or we'll get out of the business. Sounds great, Neil. I'll see you there and I'll bring it with me. Okay. All right, Neil. Thanks. Mark the day down your calendars now. I'm so glad he reminded me, because you know what a torped denim burger is. He would never, we'd go on for days and days. And then like, if two days before he'd remind me, oh, yeah, I mentioned we're going to be there, right? Friday June 14th. Veterans Day, Big Night at the Miracle. We want to break last year's attendance record. We want to have 4,000 people there. Doing it. And we ought to be able to break last year's record because no Gilbert this time. That should bring out like another 2000 who can't handle him anymore. Like me? Miami. Are you doing Neil? Okay. Listen, I couldn't believe that great sports department could muster up enough, uh, cloud to do the U.S. That has nothing to do with the sports departments here. That has to do with our upper level management that had too many spots on that we didn't want to lose the revenue on. We can't afford to put it on. The sports department you can be sure is always ready at a moment's notice to preempt anything on this station. What I'll aim is sports departments. He's pretty common to us. I think this is a morning death of Bobby Weaver. 118 in WIOD. We have an open line in day. 7 5 1 9 4 6 3 7 5 1 WIOD. Nice hearing from Ed Kaplan. Let's go to a land 10. Hello. How you doing Neil? Okay. Right. First of all, I'd like to say, uh, happy tomorrow day weekend. And the same to you for whatever that means. Thanks very much. Uh, Neil, is it, it's true you used to announce the exposed games down here. The West Palm Exposure Sir. Right. I'm going to go to a game tonight. I hope to have a good time. Will you with air on now? No, not me. Okay. Well, hey, another thing that comes last night. When you can post squeeze off twice. Is what any you're doing? When you can squeeze it twice the one and you're really doing. That's what Mark Racers. Really? I didn't think it was a new manager with pull that up. That one off. Well, he's pulling it off anything off he can get. Sir, he said pull that all the stops. It's now or never. All his predictions are to be so. I don't know if that's the end of how I'm taking a weapon. We start. Well, I think Harrison is in the same coma that Don Zimmer was in. I mean, he just isn't making any moves. I thought they'd for sure pinch run for Sirron there. And Emily did he not pinch run for him. But then he tried to run him on a hit run and he got thrown out by like 75 yards. I was just, uh, me. He had to slide in the first and while. I don't know if this thing or something to run. Get on the thing. Yeah. Yeah, that was great. That belly flop slide into first. That was outstanding. Yes. It was even better when Hojo was picked off base. And then he made it back to first and two pitches later. They tried running and he got thrown out by 5000 pieces. Great. Hey, listen, Neil. And closing. I'd like to call a friend tomorrow. I'm sure you would. Okay. Don Nelson and Volva Connor. You're a tremendous beast back. Okay. Have a nice life. Funny. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Awesome. Have one noticed that people are still having a wrecked. If Vincent driving courses have absolutely no effect. Chirits and constables comes to the warn there.

Have a great life, Bill. Now, we're up to our long-distance dedication. And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether we have kids or pets or neither. It's from a man in Cincinnati, Ohio. And here's what he likes. Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere, and it'll need a lot if you play it. Recently, there was a death in our family. He was a little dog named Snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of us comes to it again. From coming out of the record. Play the record, okay. Please. See, when you come out of those up-tempo, damn numbers, man, is impossible to make those transitions. And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know, they do this to me all the time. I don't know what they're like doing for it, but damn it. If we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand it. He's down on the phone. Okay, I want to, damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a f***ing up-tempo record. Every time I do a damn death dedication. Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. It's a god-lask, damn time. I want somebody who's a f***ing brain to not come out of a damn record that's up-tempo, and I gotta talk about a f***ing jaw dying. Well, it's just imponderous, man. Ponderous, imponderous. Well, hello. Hi there. I'm your new neighbor. I'm entertaining guests, and I've seen you have run out of coffee. Welcome in with, with bulger's coffee, be too good for your guests. Oh, that would be Jeff. It's perfect. How could I ever repay you? Oh, I don't think of something. Well, have a nice party. Hey, you, uh, a mentionew neighbor yet? Oh, I just popped in with a coffee. Bulger's coffee for those budding relationships. Thank you, Scott. 1-38. Isn't it something to hear his voice again? I think we can get a sore throat just from here in it. North Miami Beach. And now what's going on? How you doing, sir? Pretty good at that. You're happy, you're weekend right around the corner. No, I'm not. I gotta be here on Monday. Everybody, we just get screwed over so bad. Are you working Monday, Johnny Dark? Even Johnny Dark has to play that slush on a holiday. Sir, how do you like that? Oh, and he's threatening to boycott. He's so pissed off about it. But he needs a money to bet. Well, we, uh, we, uh, we. I hope Fleetwood Grover's listing Johnny said if he's got to work Monday, he's walking out. And we'll be right behind him by 400 yards. Well, I'm kind of curious. Did you hear anything about that new dice movie? Did I hear, yeah, somebody went down there and saw it at that one theater. Said it was pretty good. It was. You saw it, sir? No, I haven't seen it yet. Oh, well, he said it was good. Of course, that doesn't mean anything. I think he was a relative. Maybe it was Johnny Dark's. Yeah, I doubt it. That's a little too racy for Johnny. So it also going on up there. That's about it. Everybody's bailing out of here. They're closing up the whole place and nailing the board shut on the outside and they'll go in home for a long busmins holiday. Hmm. That's it. Sounds good. Yeah. Okay. Okay, touch it with us. See ya. Four Latterdale. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Well, I got a store for you. Okay, we're ready. We can handle it. Good. Uh, now that the beach lasts Friday, walking down on the beach. It's by A1A and East Los O'Lis in front of the elbow room. A1A, O' the elbow room. A1A, your gay one way. Yes. Yes. You know, right down the butt of the bill, tomorrow. Anyways, right in front of the left, I'm walking along. And what do I see? I see two women and gorgeous women, not roof roofs, but, you know, sunbathing the breasts. And I just want to know with all the morality and everything that these people preach, you know, know new dancing in the bars and surfing alcohol, and Nick Navarro and his stormtroopers. Where the hell are they? And they say, they want that family. I know what they're going to do. You know, and they want that, that it's going to be a family thing. Killspring break. Can't have none of that. Well, we want families out there, uh, new down the beach. That's what we want. The family that new beds together sticks together. Yeah. That's the new motto on the beach. You know, I would be a cup span, but I'm a San Francisco fan. I like to pick and they lose their... Oh, man. You must be, you know, what do you sound depressed? 12 and 20. What is it 12 and 28? There's 16 games under 500? I don't understand it. They got mad Williams and, uh, will Clark and Kevin Mitchell. I mean, they should just be an awesome run-making machine. They have no pitching, but... The best baseball I ever saw was, uh, well, the cups lost. When they had to, once for the penit, like two or three years ago, when they went to seven games and they were just... You think that the cups, you know, one team was out, and they just... Everyone just kept coming back. Didn't go to seven games, or did they go to lost in five games? Giant's wiped his wipe the mat with us. No. Yeah, I didn't go to seven games. We only won one game. No. Yes. I mean, you're the one they played. Oh, so you're talking to a man who lives in dyes with the cups in your suggestion. I don't know what I'm talking about. That we won. We split the two games in Chicago and then the Giant's won three straight in San Francisco. We lost in five games, sir. Oh, well, it was a good anyways. I mean, uh... Well, obviously, we're really into it deeply. Have a great life, pal. Bye. Wow. Talk about people who are confused. I guess it was those boobies he saw on the beach that got to him. We have an open line at Broward, five two four WIOD. Here's a lady in plantation. Hi, Neil. Hi. I'm getting ready for Memorial Day here. I have my potato salad cooking. And I made the hamburgers. And I just wanted to relate to the crepts capital of the world. I've just come back from. The crepts capital? Oh, the crepts? I thought you said the crept capital. Who's a good recall that to write to us? I have never had such an... a smell as when you go through the big Mickey world. You go from right to right and there's all different fibers. Everywhere it does me, Adam High Mines. I guess when it's dark, they just decided to time. I don't understand. I'm missing something somewhere. Creps? Creps? You know, poison was required. Oh, well, listen, let's get laid on a Friday. You want sharp material for me? I don't get it. Well, I don't get it. Yes, that's all I heard while I was up there. Oh, in other words, you're saying all little kids on the rides are having a little car. All the old people. All the old people that were German people there and English people over here. And they... Oh, well, there's nothing worse than a German fart. That's the other way to the worst. That brought worse than all that solar pot. The things are there, that that's not what they serve all that different food. And then you go on one line, I guess everybody thinks, since you can't see on the ride, they can just go ahead and let go. Yeah. Well, I can't see each other, so they have to have some kind of a signal. Oh, I'm telling you, it's over. If you ever go there. Okay. Right in the mouth. Alrighty. I'll borrow that nose clip from Tony Cruz. You have a good weekend. You too. Bye-bye.

You're not going to beltsville, Maryland. I swear to God. What the hell are you going to do there? I've got a job and I'm going to school up there. You got- There's no such place come on. I swear to God. Really? Yes? Well put a good word in for us. Tell them we're still on the air up there. I think they're losing something. You're all calm down when the ratings come out and if they're not good, I mean I've seen the buildings when I've been up there. Yeah. Yeah. Hey. A little gas wing goes a long way. A little Vaseline. I think they already slipped that dust to be honest with you. Well have a great life up there. Give us a call sometime. We like hearing from Beltsville. Oh hey. I'll call. I've been listening here for five years and I'm really going to miss you. Yeah. Well that's our problem. The whole audience moved out of town. We found this covered at the wrong hour.

I mean we've been trying to convince everybody for all these years about what a God forsaken the depressing dank toilet this is. Maybe finally one day they said, you know what he's right. Let's get the hell out of here. They're all gone. They're gone. And I do notice we're getting a hell of a lot more out of town cosplay. We too London and Paris and Beltsville and you name it. We're getting a Cheek to Wagan New York. Miami. Is this the wrong call? I think I just did Miami. Boca and a Sterlide. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Great. What? Sensational. Hey there you go. Fabulous. How's that? What's up? Not much. Just calling in. Say hello. Okay. See how it's how it's going there. Yeah. And other than that that's about it. First time I'm calling in. Well how was it? How was what? The call. How was the experience? Come on. You're with it. I have a big weekend. All right. I like to call a couple of people to do it. That's why why did you just say that at the beginning. Instead of making a fool yourself and pretending that you had a reason for calling and asking how I'm doing. Do you want to say something? Do it. No. You don't. No. Well that's fine. But just do it. Okay. I stand up and be a man. I want to call. So you don't have a big player. A major douchebag. Now you're talking. And later in most of the guys down at ACS. The major major douchebags. Oh. Good job sir. Okay. See you. Have a great life. See you got to put some of these people up a little bit. Laura brings me a fact that says could you call Michael American Express a douchebag? No, I will not call Mike at American Express a douchebag. Oh, yes, I will. Because it says I have some mid 80's cubs your books for you. Look for them in your box by Tuesday. Now if I get that 86 cubs your book, I may not be able to come in on Tuesday. Oh man. The one with that Mike Balucky picture in there. I'm telling you, I can't handle that. Nobody in the world is supposed to look like that. It should be against the law. So thank you so much to people from whoever the hell is in Boca. Let's go to a pump and a hello. Hey Neil. Yeah. You know, I was listening to your car today about that first car. The one. The bus car. You know, everybody's person on here. Yeah. I just get that same problem. I don't know what to do with it. Yeah. Yeah. It just comes out and. Boom. Okay. Well, that's the next one called end of week on. I hope by sure we get that fixed by Monday. So that's a good holiday. Okay. Yes. Yes. I'm wondering that. I want me to talk to you about. Eight figures. About boys and boats we could talk about earlier. About one. Biggers, cars and boats. Now we're talking about bridges over the. Causeway not the ones in your mouth. I don't have any of my friends. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Calm down. It's a good idea. But you're regulated by the United Corps of Engineers. You got to give. No. Well, it is all bridges over Navidbo Waterway. If I knew that, I wouldn't have been asking. But that. I said if I knew the answer to the question, I wouldn't have asked it in the first place. Okay. Well, I'm saying sir. Here's that. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So it's up to them to decide what time. Yeah. The bridges should not be open to the marine traffic. Yes. And what time should they not be open to marine traffic, sir? I'm. I'm telling you that they come up with a. Time. Well, what is the time? I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. I'm going to be. Well, what? What is the time? I believe it's at wish hour times, sir. That they are not open to marine traffic. Other than that, they are open to marine traffic. So in other words, any slump with a boat can come along and back up traffic for two months. I'm absolutely correct sir. Well, what kind of a communist bunch of crafters there? That is not a communist bunch of facts. Sounds like some kind of wind with all things. This is Tommy Pickle. You got time. Beware of shit. I'll be the one. Right. The exact time. The boat is going to stop for 5,000 cars. Got it? No, I think that 50,000 cars ought to stop for one jackass in his boat. I think that's what they ought to do. Thank you better know your law's Mr. because you should go. That's right. I suppose you want the damn biggest close to both sides. They're going to hurt. I want the bridges closed period. Okay. I want them closed. I want the bridge headed to go home and watch the MTV and get the lot of our lives. I want those bridges closed. Let them use the Julia Tuttle. Okay. Let them use the Bacartha Grozberg. I think they all are going to George Washington Bridging Jump all over the Bredge Tenders. How do you like that sir? Well, I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic. Well, I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic. Jump, stupid, stupid, stupid idiotic. Jump, stupid idiotic. Yeah. 1230 in WIOD.
