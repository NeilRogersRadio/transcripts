Whatever you say. So you want to hear a little bit of it? No, I want you to send it to me. I don't want to hear it on the phone. We don't do stuff like that. We don't do it over the phone.

I could get into that. Man. I'm looking. I thought something electrical under the table here was like smoking. And I looked down and there in the waste basket. I see this red glow. It's spreading like a wildfire. Like smokey the bear is going to come in and hose us all in a second. Mobile in Miami. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Hey, he's doing it. Okay. Neil, I listen to CNN this morning. They mentioned that Super Bowl thing. So you've been talking about. Yeah. Some of the people from the NFL said that don't play the game and they play games like that before in the past. Hey, listen. Like I said, the NFL will be the last thing to cancel anything. Okay. Believe me when I tell you that because they believe that national football league is more important than anything. I can't imagine why a channel 10 would do that. You know, say those things get everyone all freaked out. What do they say exactly what they say? I don't know. I didn't listen to a channel 10. I listened to CNN. You know, good thing. I mean, channel 10 just give you a bunch of propaganda. If you want to know what's really going on to them. See, man. Yeah. That's right. One other thing. I saw you with three votes. And what? At the call the remote. Yeah. And I thought to me when you go to the Gulf, see one of the telemen in the head of time to get you a monitor. So you can see what the hell is going on. I already told him that. I mean, that was, you know, it was fun. It was funny. But I mean, I'm sitting here. I'm looking under the intent. I can't see anything. It was kind of like a press trading courseman or CSP. Okay. You know, see, when is that call? The February sometime. We'll let you know. We pushed it back a couple of weeks. We don't want to do them like back to back. Yeah. It's nice over there. Even 11. I was there for. What do you mean? I'm going to love it. Like I've never been to Gulf Street. We can't come to open on the Gulf Street. Well, Gulf Street is like a big time, a beautiful place with a palm trees. It's fabulous. Let me tell you what I did, I didn't want to. I went to the director's buffet. Yeah. It's a morning workout. It was wonderful. 99. You buy it. If you're the philosopher, we'll class us. Can't beat it with a stick. It's going to be a great meeting. Okay. Okay. Now. Okay. Have a great one. 158 at WIDA. Calder's last day is Sunday and Gulfstream opens on Monday. Man, I can't wait for that.

You know, like Saturday, go over to Gulfstream, punch your brains out and then get in the car and zip over to Papadau for another 13. 10 of Gulfstream and 13 more 23 chances to punch your guts. God. Don't forget our big pick. Oh, is this the Heat Guy on six? Hello. Yeah. How you doing? Oh, okay. Yeah. How's everything? He did not Perry. Hey, I'm here. What was that? What do you want him for? Wait, what do you want from him? Rich. He's calling. Just get out of that. Get your nose out of the paper and get on the stick. What is it, sir? I see you shot him. Come and he's been right there. You're just getting old fire. Right. It's hot. I about that. He aren't there. Oh, man. Look at that. There's Ronnie cycling. He's right in the middle of my basket. Look at that. He's a mess. He can go down. He's going to come back. He's off for five days. But we come back. He's going to be back. He's going to be doing it. Yeah. And what are you saying? We're going to get Dolph Shaz on that team to and Johnny Kerr. Ronnie rising. You got it, buddy. I'll be Yankee. It's going to be great. It's going to be wonderful. Okay, sir. You don't care. You know what they say downtown, don't you? Go, sir. He did up. Anyway, we have an open line in Broward. That man is just a bit. He's coming around a little bit. He's like the giant span. You know, he's starting to come around a little bit, which is what I'm afraid of. Corey hasn't called it. Has he? Thank God. Anybody want to hear that song? Oh, man. See Corey, if you weren't such a pain in the ass, we'd play it on his show. If he gave us a copy that we could hear. Five, two, four, WOD. We have an open line in Broward. Palm Beach is just sitting there. Soking in is usually do 65, five, nine, four, six, three. Now let's see, who's going to be doing the news at 11 o'clock? Anybody we know? No, I can't. Or really can. Well, we'll just take pot luck. We'll come back at 11.05. It ain't on the corner. That must mean Marvin. Rick and Sudged it, too. Are you a basketball coach? To get in touch and talk with Neil, dial 751 WOD from Dave. In Broward is 524 WOD. Palm Beach, 655 WOD. A bell-top mobility customers. Make it a free call by dialing star, IOD. The opinion is expressed with... Well, the who's saying things we got. I love it. You know, I love it because I love that coach's pot. You know? But where's that tape we got? The Rogers got. If we can steal from an area who's on permanent vacation, man, he's unbelievable, but a contract he must have. I like that. See what he does. As you go as I'm two weeks and then he does the two weeks again. Because that's the way he does everything. Where's that tape with the Coke spots? I love that. My favorite one is a one with the fortunes. That we used to argue about all the time about who's saying it. God is that. Here it is. Okay. Okay. We'll get to that when we have a moment to hear your law. But at the meantime, here's Kendall. See how are you today? Okay. Sir, hi, you be. Listen, I don't want to get too personal. But I hope you do a better job on saying your diet this time. You're right. No, hey, listen. I'm the first one. But you know something most of us who fight this all our lives, well, you know, pretty weak. Because you have a hard time keeping your word on the fact that you said over the rear that you know more eating on your program and that your system was it forever. That's right. And we really would like to have you around for a long time. I'll leave you another couple of weeks anyway. Anyway, Kelly said in the paper. Kelly. Oh, Jim Kelly. Mr. Lou. How's that the razor blade doing by the way, Jim? Oh, excuse me. He said that it's up to him to make the decision whether he plays or I play. He plays boy. Let's send him letters. Say all of us down here. Remember those great years that you win. We love him. We want him to play. We want him to be a star. Well, this is the make it kind of equal because Kelly will have a break on his knee and Marina will have a break on his knee. Right. Well, Marina has always got a break on his knee. Well, it kind of makes it will make it even like a even higher. He's got like a sore mouth now to understand. He's got a little problem. We'll stick to your diet. And we hope you lose a lot of weight. I'm going to stick it, pal. Okay. See you. Yeah. He's right. No, and as a matter of fact, I got to call yesterday on the show that inspired me to do my thing about light bulb radio. And the guy was right. I mean, when I'm wrong, I'm wrong. Which is most of the time. And he was right. And that's what kind of awakened me to the fact that just a bunch of crap. And this guy is right. Look at Oprah though. See, at least I didn't do that. I mean, Oprah lost all that weight on drinking at the pub. And then she, you know, came on, I never forget. They kept showing that on the news. And she's spinning around and ripping off her little jacket. And she looks like a twiggy and a heap. And look how skinny I am. And you know, here she's on national TV. You know, like setting this great example. And she's talking up how she did this great job. And now she looks like a balloon and he. She looks like a cross between Dave game, Debbie Ellis and the moonman. I mean, she is brutal. She's a cow. And now she's in, oh, don't talk to me about anymore. I just, I don't want to hear about it anymore. Yeah, nice job, honey. And she's got billions of dollars. Not millions, billions with a bee, which is really frightening when you stop and think about it to begin with. I wouldn't you think with her money. I mean, what does she need? What does she want? What the hell do you want, Oprah? Anyway, we have an open-up getting emotional. 751 WildD and Dave. We do have one sitting there. We get very emotional. We have an open line. You know, how we are? Do you know how I'll prep you best in the next way? You will love it, right? I don't like that one, do you? It's all right. It's not going to go bad. Okay, let's take a Miami call. Hello. Hey, do you know how you do it? Okay, pal, how's your day going? Oh, great. That's good. Glent on your extended. Oh, it's thermon, pome, pome. Take him any ass, sir. Nailette. Thermon. And I can't hear the black name of it. I would have to be. Please, who's the best? He's going to, like, glucoprosy. Yeah. Please, who's the best? Okay. And I'd like you to play that song all day. Sounds like you swim with a fish as to be honest with it. Play what song? The dolphin. Miami, go. Miami, go. Come on, Miami, go. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on, man. We're going to go nuts. Right, get everybody in the mood. J.R. Saloon on Saturday. A Rick and Sputter going to be up there. That's the only way we can make Spuds Watch the game is having up in a saloon. Give him a couple of belts. We have an open line of date county 7519463751WOD. The real key to adjacent on not sliding what a torpeous could is that he wears a spenders, which means someday he'll probably get into radio beer program director. He's a jackass. What can I tell you? We'll he'll be perfect. Anyway, now we have two open lines in date. Wow, where are these ladies? We heard the not sliding lady. We have one other lady today. You see, let me tell you a little clue. This is over. The holiday shopping, Hanukkah news, all of parties. It's over. So all the excuses. We know you're out there. We did well in women in this time on the show. We went up a little bit, actually. So we know you're out there. And when we go to those remote, are you amazed by all the women who show up, including many, I want to just make another little plug for a myriad by the way, cuts my hair. She is a knockout. Wouldn't you agree with that? She is beautiful. So if you're horny guys out there, want to get your hair trimmed. And have a good look close to Miriam and cut a lot and give a little elbow while she's trimming your thing. I write across the street that they have a take. She is just gorgeous. She really is. And evidently, nobody got her the message because she keeps like, like, fondling me and stuff like that while she's cutting the hair. Anyway, the market's up about eight and a half points. It's 12 minutes after 11. She does. She's like ready to, I think. It will be right back. Can't believe I forgot to mention that the Friday night tomorrow night, Pompado Park, 10th race. Christmas list, our stable horse is going to be going out of the seven hole in the 10th race, Joe Pavia is still driving. And this time, Kevin Wallace is back because he had a three day suspension. He got sit down for going too fast. I think. And so he's coming back. So he'll be in there with some horse that'll leave out of there in about 26 seconds. It'll open up a nice hole in Joe, drop in the two hole. Get a perfect trip and come out of this rich and wind tomorrow night. We're doing for a win. You hear that Alan? Ross, we're going to talk about, what was the name of that horse again? Have you got the program? Because I got mine here somewhere too. That Jeff Gregory of Peace. Jeff's awesome. Wait, but here he comes. Hit him again, Jeff. Hit it. Here he comes. He's on his hands and easy as crawling to the line. And this is like a day and a half later. Next time they put a horse out there in a track years ago, there was a horse. Dick McCombra. I'm sorry, Dick, you're a great guy. Love you. He had a horse called chicken picker. Seriously, chicken picker. He was like a cheap climber. He came out on track. The horse looked like he wanted to lay down. They bet him down based on the program to like three to five. And he ran just like Jeff's exactly the same way only worse. Jeff's awesome in the 10th race. There he is. Renee, Nate, Don. Renee? It's big holiday in Quebec. You better go back and dump us out, pal. We got your bus ticket right here. Miami. Yeah, yeah. Look, boy, I can get on the same bus. How you doing? Great. Hey, I wanted to tell you something about colder. Yeah. I'll have to go with a friend of mine. He lived there at the track. So it was a pretty good handicap. Yeah. And this one horse goes off. 20 to one. We've been losing all day. That's $200 on the horse. Yeah. You said they can't lose. Yeah. It takes off. Yeah. Why are the ones? Yeah. 18 links ahead of the field. This qualifies. No. Go on into the stretch. Horseballs, jocky falls, every buddy falls. Horse loses. What do you think about that? What do you mean the horse was way ahead of the field in the fell? Tread. He tripped. Last turn. One of his stretch. $4,000. You would have won. Yeah. Well, I don't want to get you to press, but you know what? I would do if I had that situation. Was that? Shit the horse. No. Myself. Yeah. Okay. Had to say something. Somebody's trying to tell us something. To who? To my brother Craig, who's out there listening. Sirius Doosberg. Have a great day, Phil. All right. Okay. Don't do it again. A fool in his money are soon part-hearted. We have an open line in date, 751. Well, we got a lot of that. We're getting heavy duty tomorrow. We're going to go nuts with the dolphin song. We might even play Corey song tomorrow. Do you think so? Should we take a vote on that? All right. Let's do a poll. Should we have a Gilbert on the show or should we have Corey song on that? Should we? Life is much more fun when you're in France. And co-create is you, then? It's the refresh she gets. Let's go. And, Rob, what's the plan to bring? Well, we'll get to the one that I like in a second. This is like a montage of all the different big co-spots that Roger has on her for some reason. Let's go to a mobile in Miami. When is this? Hi, how are you? I'm going to stop. Great. The reason I call is I went to school with Jim Kelly. I suppose a freshman when he was seen here. We lived in the same building. Are you a serial, you mean you M? Yes. The U of M? Yes. Class of 86. That's me. Class is the word, sir, for you M football, believe me. Right. What? What? What's the school there? What's our job at that time? A friend of mine from high school was the back of quarterback there. His first name was Mark. And what I'm telling you that there was nobody in the stand. Yeah, you're right. Not even students. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. That's right. If you're a student, body, if I can use that expression, man, you got problems. Well, you know, if you have to, if you ask the university why that is, it's because it's an off campus facility. Can I ask you a question? Class, you're serious question before you get back to your point. I don't want to divert your attention. How come, how come somebody of the students at UMR so ugly? Is there a special reason for that? Yeah, because a lot of them come down from Connecticut. Oh, yeah. Okay. Bridgeport. Like, every one from the city of Bridgeport. They must know that kids, Joey, that calls Rick and Suts from Connecticut all the time. That was you related to him. Yeah, like he doesn't have Suts. He just got one, like on his neck just one big one. Yeah, right. He is a zit. But anyway, as they say in Rhode Island, he's got zit for brains. Now what is it, sir? Well, you know, remember, you probably do when he had a shoulder separation or he broke his arm or something. Yeah, and he also had that little problem with his foot. Yeah, but he had a arm that's playing for a while. Yeah, that's right. Pretty cool. He was hanging out and he was drinking a few beers. Yeah. And then like he went into the pros and he became this major asshole. All right. Not the mention. He's ugly. Oh, Kelly, you bet. But let me ask you this question. I don't want to get into a whole thing here, but you have quarterbacks. For example, Testiverty has got to nose the size of Rosanne Barzanne's. Cosa has got to nose the size of the Pope's ring. Oh, I mean, talking really ugly people. Steve Walsh is grow test-glookin and can't really play that well either. And the only hope we got his Ericson if we can patch up those holes in this face. He's seriously. If he had like no holes in this face, he'd look great. And he's actually playing great. I can't believe it. He's got like no upper lip. You ever noticed that? No, no, so he a couple of stole it. Oh, yeah, I tried. She's got that triple lip. Yeah. He's got somebody else's lip. And the Craig got a little bit out of shape because before after the game, what all I controversy, a coach told him, keep us stiff up or a lip and he got upset about that. But I don't know what happened to Jimmy was pretty cool, but another thing I wanted to touch up on. So in other words, he's an asshole. That what you're trying to say. Well, yeah. Well, good. Then I hope he starts on Saturday and I hope we just drive him into the ground into the threat and no in turn. 75% of the whole. I'll need lead in in with that. I'll need lead in with that. I'll need lead in with that. satisfactory skills, though. Siphon Sugar trips is brokers are there too. No n appreciate. Americans don't want to be a levar in one day. So he said, fine, maybe I don't employ an ortho or a rép. It's my first time. No, not so much. Frankly speaking. lawyers are there. The first Mark Lawyer in the government has always been kind of going into. I think he's like a low-cost child. He said, hey honey. He's my sixth elle. Wow. Yes, isn't that perfect? Even though he was aware of the movement, for it, it was just one of the events of my lifetime. I'll tell you that when I loved it. Well, I hate the game and I watch it when I got home because I was seriously dolphin in Kansas. Right. And did you watch it the game on TV at all? I watched it. Well, I was saying before, I somebody told me you're taping. I watched parts of it last night and much of the whole thing. I watched the highlights. Okay, one of the highlights was like, Marino, when he was coming on to the field when the score was 16 to 10. So, look at his face. Oh yeah. Pensity. And to be honest. You know something, I got to tell you this and I really mean it. I'm going to try to be a shield for the dolphin. Dan Marino is great as he is. He's never gotten the credit that he deserves in his town. He has done so much. And I know he pissed a lot of us off a few years ago when he held out and we lost the Houston game and he was, you know. But the bottom line is he is so good and so cool and so confident and it's just incredible. What he did Saturday. The last ten in a row and he threatened a fourth quarter in the clutch. You took the words right out of him and it goes back to the game we had to have a month ago against Philadelphia. He is the same thing. When the chips are down, he gets the job done. You know, he didn't have a supporting task for a while. And let me tell you, I'm not a dolphin maniac like certain people. But you've got to give Marino his do. And I really think that if the chips are down this Saturday and we can hang in there, Marino is going to get the job done. If there was anyone, I would rather have Marino now than Montana taking credit. Because Montana is God like super stars all around them. You know, and quite frankly, the rest of the dolphins are 75% of the rest of the team. The mediocre. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't say 75% but he certainly didn't have, you know, bloody young players. He is incredible. That's all I can tell you. Yeah, he's the, just so I'm looking forward to it. Plus, I have a feeling why he's in his going to kick the crap out of the 49ers now. When that be going, no, I hope the 49ers win. I hope we play the 49ers in the Super Bowl. And I hope Steve Young starts. Let's not kick carried away. We don't want to see the 49ers anywhere for about five more years. Okay, I'll buy that. Let's Steve Walsk comes back and starts at center. Have a great day, sir. We're going to kick some as we hope. We hope. See you. Now, you're not going to go away. Are you Allen J. Michael? It's here waiting for you. Okay. Well, you're always waiting for me. Hold on a second. We're going to do a little commercial break. You can understand that I'm sure Allen J. Finkelson is on a line. 23 after 11. We have an open line in date. 7519463. Can he tow it as in the studio? Which means if there are any important papers cover him up and we'll be right back. Okay, 1126. This better be good. Alan, because that a full board of calls and half of them drop. He'll as soon as I said you're on the line. What is it? Neil, this is good. You asked for something the other night. Went upstairs and spoke to the judges. Yep. They're doing something about it. They was like, if you would come with me when you come Friday night for Christmas list race. You bet you'll come upstairs with me. Yep. They're both. Yep. And we'll sit down with them and they'll show it to you and then I believe by Monday when you go back on, you can release it to the public. Great. How's that? Excellent. If you're everything, if you're a fan, the public's supposed to be supported, that's what we want. We appreciate. We know you only want the right thing and so to we. Amen. How's that? That's great. Thank you. And here he comes. Now, wait a minute before you go, I just can't eat. Toby just had to meet the program sheet for the 10th race tomorrow. What is that? What was that? What the hell was that? That was what? Oh, there must be Mickey McNickle who's hiding in Allen's office this morning. Is that it? This is when you appear as Mickey. You're bad. What did I mean? Okay. Hit him. Oh, there he's in the air. Look out. He's another break. Come on Mickey, straighten him out. Now listen, we got Kiwisaki on a reel who'll go out in about 26 and a piece with crazy Kevin Wallace who is your best driver by the way. And the horse that I'm worried about in that Christmas. He's from Michigan. You wanted to tell you and here's another Michigan horse that I'm very worried about that's going to be the horse to beat for Christmas list. Ogden Low Bell out of the tool with Peter Renn. Another Michigan guy. Right, Michael Gorshi, that's a Norris horse. Look out. The horse has a horse as a record of 55 last year at Papeno Park, a lifetime record of 52 and one. He was off for a while. He needed the last start and he could be tough here. So I would say a 2772 perfect a box of beer for our fans tomorrow night. Okay. Now what else have we got tomorrow night? Along with that we got the big trout with free token. There are some other big races tomorrow. Right. Sure. The race secretary said it'll be the best car since the breedest crown. So I'm looking forward to having you and everybody else off. Excellent. Everybody who just will be on. Everybody who got shut out Monday when lights went out. We had a cancel racing. Bring back double the money tomorrow. We'll have a big night tomorrow night. Right. Okay. All in thank you. Thanks. Alan J. Ficklesson from Papero Park where tomorrow night we got the big 610 WOD. Whatever it is with Christmas list in the 10th race. Okay. So bring your a thing out and you're a pass to. We have an open line in Broward 5249463. Now how do you like that? Did I get some action on this? I went right to him and you know me. I mean I lose all the time up there. I just to take it and strike. I don't get upset. But when I see a horse that's 400 lengths behind a field and gasping for oxygen. And that's at the start. That's at the start. Okay. Let's go to Carl Springs. Hey Uncle Neil. How you doing sir? Welcome to the real world. Okay. Welcome to a real not house. Hey listen I have a senior citizen report here. I was at McDonald's. Timbroke Pines. Right. Yeah. And they have the desert that you sunk into this place pretty hard. They were really napkin. How was that? Is that in the glass? Oh Jesus. I saw old bank the United States in the piece of minced meat pie in the glass. The teeth were in the glass. And I said minced this. They were asking for the one you were the sample. I saw a guy take a whole tray. Take a plastic tray and do his car. What's that? Oh he's eating that a little later on. That's for a little bit. What is there sir? There's a little of the other whole closet. That's for he's got a closet full of something I bet. We're on a sandy bags up the Buffalo and have him pick that city's bones clean. What do you think? Oh actually what we're going to do channel four and their state is doing another thing with his color rectal tests where he sent the samples in. Yeah. And I think we ought to set them all up to rich stadium and our slogan for the game can be it's in the bag. Right on. Open them up right next to Jim Kelly just before the game. There you go. Give him a little ether. Have a great day sir. Let's hope we kick some ass. Okay. And let's hope it's not our own. 1130 at WIOD. I mean like I said regardless Saturday what happens. It's been an incredible uplifting year and in this time of course anything could be an improvement. We have an open line in Broward 524 and Palm Beach. We had a call on Palm Beach today. We were not complaining because we're doing great every place else. Old followers back from vacation they're waiting for 1130 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward 5249463 524 WIOD. Why don't have the right carton machine I'm sorry. Miami. Hey Neil. How you doing? I have a few things. You have a few things? Well that school teacher at the game. Yeah she sure was and you know something she's come down a lot. I think the word is getting back to where she's making a jackass out of herself. He really got the word. She only went three times. What happened when Marina threw that type of stuff. I put your head right out of flat on top of the chair and just cut the crap. What is it? And then the other thing that the couple of the things. Number one I think we should take often. Danny's use of what I'm putting on Gilbert. Who is this Mitchell by any chance? No. Okay. No. You don't know Mitchell do you? No I don't. By the way we have a Allen was just on the line. I wonder if they're listening over there. Pompano because Gary sidebell is a great guy. It's a great job announcing the races and it's also lost a couple of pounds. He was getting star-star and looked like Dave game on a bad day. But Mitchell I mean Gary's got some interesting friends. He's got Mitchell from the bizarre and bizarre I think speaks for itself. And Super Dave was hanging around with him up there the night. So Gary I want to tell you something that explains a lot. When you work for Allen and thinklson I guess it's a spreading to your friends. Well I think that's your brain. I'd like to say to you you do every year that you'll wonder for job for the millisauce. My friend who's big big man. He's a big man. He's a big man. He's a big boss. And you do a great job. Couple other things. Number one. I think that. Yeah. Just come down. I'm excited. Let us do the earlier. So you just keep the pressing on. I'm just excited. Okay. Henry Banner said he was thinking about bringing you a drink to the I want to radio act. Yeah. Yeah. Get who is on today show. One eater favorite. Yeah. I know but we don't talk about them. Sir sir we don't really care. Piss on that. 1132 at W. I. Do we have an open line in Dave County 7519463 and one in Palm Beach ought to do something pretty soon. What do you hear sucking around for is there some special reason? What are you looking for information in here? Palm Beach 6559463. This is the walking leak is a matter of fact over here. So maybe he'd fit in on that thing. Keep his game. Yeah. Yes sir how you doing? Good. I've been procrastinating long enough for this. That time should be a little calmer. Well I was just going to say it's funny. Should you took it right out of my mouth. We have a 108,000 $601. We had a couple of checks dribble in here today. So we need another 1,400 to get to 110. Which I think would be just a real nice rounding up total. Listen can I get a T shirt too? If I send in the catribution and enough to cover postage. Yes. What would that come to? 100 bucks. 100 and the tape and the T. Right. Did you follow any of what was happening? Why did my say that long? In other words don't hold my breath. Is that what you try to say? Oh no. Just writing it down. Sound like your breathless at that point. Come out to pump it out of Mars. There will give you a couple of steps. You can make some money. Are you going to have the T shirt there? What? It's just a joke. It's just a little joke. No. You got to send in through the mail. All right. I'll get it out. Or if you come by the where do you live? If you come by the station like when we're open during business hours for 40 bucks they'll sell your T shirt and a tape I've front. You have the T shirt there and the tape? Yeah another setting. That's great. Yeah. That's better than 100 but I'll tell you. Well hey listen. Well well response I got obviously I don't want to squeeze you too hard. Okay if you're part of that expression I mean it sounds like 100 would be asking you too much. And we only expect people to you know give what they can afford. I understand. There's a who's the tiger broadcast of the morning. Ernie Harwell. Ernie Harwell. I've heard this year. The people of WJ by the way managed. You made a very good plan. This was right on top of the story. Did have the wrong call it as though. Jim WGR is in Buffalo. Okay WGR isn't Detroit and you think that a guy who went to the University of Michigan and Arbor would know the difference between WGR the great voice of the great lakes and WGR and I've got for second toilet called Buffalo on the shores of Lake Yeah I heard it first it was Shemba Street Stadium. What is it? Radio management they got ready to go. Right well no he's he's going to be there this year this is going to be a last year unless the fans protest and all of that stuff. I know they got to be going crazy. I hope the people of WGR get our hernia okay. I want to wish them all I want to wish all those two bags up there WGR a happy new year. Yeah. I hope their thing freezes to the tower in the middle of February. Or any herwell is great. As a matter of fact, or any herwell you know that thing I have played by play on a radio that we play sometime. Or any herwell is on it so I'm going to go dig it out. And as you do too. Okay have a great day sir. Or any herwell Hall of Fame broadcast or when the all-time greats even I was getting up there and here's these still as a great job. That would be like WGR and Chicago. This would be an exact parallel. It would be like WGR and Chicago saying, why do you get a little bit too old Harry? We're going to retire you after this season. That really is the first my ass a little bit. Right. It's 1136. We have an open line board. You realize how many weeks now does spring training about five or six something like that? Or are we going to cancel a season because we're going to war? See I don't understand that. I mean there's nothing funny about war and obviously it's a horrendous thing and a lot of people disappointed the yesterdays meeting brought about nothing all of that wasn't too much of a surprise when you know who you're dealing with over there. But I mean just like this show I'm not going to stop here in sitting sob every day because you know I mean that's just the insanity of life that's more we're living than okay. So life has to go on. We have an open line indeed 751 philosophy 751 WIOD. Hit him again Jeff. Come on one more time. Here he goes. Now he's smoking in the stretch. We'll be right back. Must be loaded.

Do you know that some of the troops are listening to that tape over in Saudi Arabia? Plain. Huh? Yeah they'll do it for good. No seriously that's true. It's just in the complimentary one to the Dom and saying it was a deal. Yeah that should do it. Probably it's not. Now we're going to send them Gilbert. I think that may make for last minute. Last minute of Green and instead of Jim Baker yesterday they should add Gilbert over there with Aziz. Just chained to the capital of Kuwait. I think they can get the hell out real quick. Or if not this still sounds like good idea. By the way I loaned it to my douchebag friend from New York. And I would tell I mentioned now I was in the New York. I don't know if anything. I have to start with how it's turned for years. Nothing's good. He really enjoyed it. Well even how it likes this show so tell him that they may butcher him up a little bit. Okay. True.

I get out of there quick if I roll up and find myself in Palm Beach County. I would think I died and went to purgatory. Hi, I'm on my way. Even as we speak to go and speak out for a three. Great. And who haven't seen it? Not yet. On the fan. For a little more. I'm unbelievable. I'm on my way and I'm taking your words for you. You say it's good. Baby is good. It is good.

And we're used to adhere on your Island Dream 610 Wiod. In fact, I have a feeling lots of people in North Bay of Villager used to pay in for it. Star IOD. If you're on Bell South mobility, give us a jingle. Okay. Let's do a little break. Okay, let's do a little short one. Okay, how about cutting the crap 1214 at WIO Day? Look at Palm Beach. Don't you feel lonely up there? Don't you feel like some kind of like rejects from the human race I would? The pilot didn't Palm Beach. We have a lady in Pembroke Pines? Hi Neil. Excuse me. How you doing? Fine, how you? Okay. I just want to tell you that I want a guy from the Tomb of Portsray and has a nice joy to sweat a bit. Great. Thanks, Guy. You know, it's like deep in my blood. Are you a citizen? Definitely. All the way, they're a bridge. And I thought it was very good and very well done. And you're right, Sophie, it was a pit. And when somebody comes on CBS and says Sophia is just a lovely typical Italian young lady. Don't you think the Italian definitely, the Italian decadent? See, I remember Sophia Leran and she in a little abridged her and those are Italian young ladies. I don't think they look like her. I know, leave me. I don't have lips like her. I'm like, Guy. But anyway, I'm also I want to say go dolphin behind the wall the way. Yeah, you bet. My work at tomorrow, we're going to go nuts. We're just standing on free. I know. I just can't wait. I'm going to be full and tense. All week and I've got this weekend off and I'm just in a different TV. But Dave. But anyway, I know the thing I want to mention is that you were talking about women's ride is about two weeks ago. And it was so funny because I've come now for work when I down a German bike, rolled in glades there. And I'm trying to get over to pay my toll as you get on right on the German bike there. And who comes whipping down on a long time to me and I've got my blank runs trying to go over. But you. Really? And you wouldn't give me a chance to get in there to pay my toll. Yeah, I don't want you around. I was just trying to get out of your way. I know. I said he talks about women's ride with women. Well, I happen to be an outstanding driver. I really did. Yeah. So I've been driving one time. But I just had to mention that because of it's such a no ironic. Well, next time I start to do that, just hold up one finger. I'm gave you a couple. I gave you all a challenge. Good. Nearly. Actually, my late. But I love your remote. I was the last for adding in the ones before that. And the fact I'm going to go back to my own collect on the ticket. Great. And I left, you know, I put that on the left. So it's been very exciting. Yeah, for here. For here. Okay, let's do it Saturday. Okay. All the way. Go. Don't go. Don't go. Don't go. Thanks. Bye. Well, 17 at WIOD. We have a see the thing with the turnpike tools. It's such a, I have lost my patience. Not that I have much to begin with. Because every time I get to no matter where I go, if I go to exact change or the change length, there's some idiot in front of me who's asking for directions to Nebraska and got the 116 receipts and the, oh, it's just, it's pathetic. Okay. What are we going to get those little automatic baskets? Okay. And stop with this crap already. Not that I'm anti-social. I don't want to get my hand scratched by the ladies with the 20 inch fingernails with the 12 tubos. But enough is enough already. Just like a good little basket. Because you know what we say about that. Anyway, you want to hear about a fabulous restaurant, actually three. You know, retirement just wasn't my style. So I began working nightstand here as a janitor in this whole office building. Yes. Just to keep busy, I guess. There's a paysable aluminum weight but any, okay, there's the big cheese now. How you doing? And I, hey, where are you? I do and you have it a pretty tough night. Yeah. Good night. Nice. You're going to watch it and watch a game to me. Yeah, but across the street, free pizza beer night over there. I'm pretty tough to eat, but I just don't watch the game with the fellas over at the bar. Oh yeah, well, I'm just going to listen to it on this whole radio here and tennis kind of shaking. I'm going to get a big screen color TV over there. It's best picture. I'm going to have big screen color. Great picture. I heard it here. Why I'd share life to be doing. And you know, I got all my work done. It's all really interesting. You're all done? Yeah, you're supposed to maybe I could. Well, I don't say what? Maybe I got my BMW and the garage. I got a lot of food and they're ready when they're I could pick up the... You can drive anything. No, no, I'll say, well, give my car keys. Why don't you clean out my car? I got a wickets in the back seat. Yeah, but this is something that's running to clean it up with Simon Eisen. I'll be back at about two hours and I'll maybe I'll bring a piece of pizza, okay, Dad? We'll get a listen. Thanks, a lot. I hear my keys and I'll be careful with the scratches of the car. I'll be back at about two hours. Two hours. Yeah, I can do it. I'm going to watch. You're not going to bring, well, you ungrateful. You Esther said you were a worthless second son. Yeah, you can't be my son. Nobody's that ungrateful. You're laughing. I'll take your staying BMW and run that mother right into the damn living. You're worth nothing. You're someone's attention. I can good sorry, you're a real fan of this. Big face. This message brought to you by the National Cursing Foundation. And remember our motto. Go. You're so. That's my opinion. I'm my Disney. Well, 23 a WOD. There is an open line at Brower at 524 WOD. What I want between now and two, I want somebody to call on the Palm Beach line and say, hi, this is Jane. I'm calling from Lakeward. When did I make you feel better? 655 9463 655 WOD. I will not rest all day. Until we get that online aid. 655 WOD. WOD. Have a standing. Nah, not good. Good voice for you. Okay, let's take your call from Miami. Hello. Hold on a second. WOD. I was killed. Come on. Okay. WOD. Hey, it's Jane. Like, where are you doing Jane? Okay, have a great day, Jane. Thanks a lot. I feel better. What is it, sir? Neil. Yeah. How you doing? Great. Hey, baseball. Yeah, right there. I got a little situation here that happened to me last night. I want to tell everybody in radio lands to see what I could do about this. Okay. We're going to start at the previous year, your time and effort in hearing this out. Okay. Last night, coming over from work, I got a flat tire, parked it in a gas station, Redox Palmetto, and I let the attendant know that I was going to be right back. And I was going to change the tire. I didn't have a speaker for you. So what happened was I got back and it wasn't there. They told the car away. This morning I called the towing company and they said, you have my car there. They said, yeah, we sure do have your car there. And it was authorized by the owner to get towed. So I called the owner all pissed off. The owner, what? The owner of the gas station. Oh, I see. You know what I mean? So I called the owner, I told him, hey, you know, I had a flat tire. You know, why are you going to tow a car away? I was going to be right back. You know, I'm going to check. I guess we do that. Excuse me? What kind of a geek would do that? Exactly exactly. So what happened? I called you. I was talking to the owner and he said, wait, wait a second, wait. I didn't call anybody. I didn't call no tow truck to tow anybody's car away. You know, if I'd wait a couple days to see that they could up. They don't pick it up. I don't know if I'm going to destroy just stories ever told. No, no, but listen to this. But listen to this. It gets better. I called the tow company. And I told the tow company, hey, you know, you guys are running a legal business here. You guys can't be doing that. First of all, when a car is on private property, right? When a car is on private property, they can't tow it away unless they get permission from the owner of that property. Yeah. Well, let's say we're going to request it. Well, no, they have a sign receipt. They got the owner has to the sign or we see to tow it to tow that car. That particular car. Right. But he's got an estimate. He's got to ask him to tow it away. And he's got a sign that they can't just come there and do it arbitrarily. No, exactly. And that's exactly what they did when they went at the right. When it's night, they went in, they took the liberty to tow in the car. So what's the upshot, sir? The upshot is I don't know what the hell to do. I've called you sitting at your house is there to give me the runner out of the cops. They're giving me the runner out. I don't know what the hell where is it? Where is the land? Where is this? This is right out the palm head off 58th street. It's a mobile gas station that I left the car there. And if anybody knows anything that I could do, I'd really appreciate it. I have one suggestion you might like it. What's that? Something to think about. Good luck found. All right, thanks. What a pilot craft. Why are they so why are there somebody nasty, surly rotten, disagreeable? This towing thing. That's one of the biggest scams going anywhere. Remember what an in Fort Lauderdale that we're towed everybody's car away and it turned out there was this gigantic scandal and everybody was getting kickbacks? You showed me one of these deals where they give one of these towing places is a contract. And I'll show you one of the great scams in the history of mankind. It is the biggest joke and the biggest rip off and some of the pigs you'll get kickbacks on this stuff. I don't want to go into it. It's depressing, right, Betty? Betty? Yeah, I think we do need a campaign to get rid of dolphin denies. Let's get the dead dog back. How dog bag? How dog, George Lorenz? The WIOD. What was that? That's before my time. Well, that's in the orange pole. They used to have the hound dog, the dolphin mask out on the sideline. We don't need dolphin denies. Yeah, amen. Let's run a campaign to run dolphin denies ass up to Buffalo and stick it in the Lake Eury. Good deal, good deal. Because I guess everybody hates him like poison, huh? Right. How do you use this? Right. And go dolphin. Amen, Betty. Thank you. Have a great life. We're with you. 100%. That's Betty from a steward, by the way. He said anybody wants to look her up. We have an open-minded, drower at 5249 for a bit. She'd off and denies wants to look her up. Stick her on a tower. And one end. Oh, he grabbed it. I can't believe you go ahead. I can handle it. Anyway, let's go to a pompadol. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you doing today? Okay, so far. Okay. I like to just tell you that I agree with you 100% about the honest drivers. I think our sign has to do something good. Think of a sign? Think of a sign. I don't think our sign has to do something about it because it's not there to the public. Some of these people are driving me crazy, you know what? It's good. I've been doing, I've been going there like 12 years. Have you ever seen any weight of it? You still have your pants on? You've been there for 12 years? Wow. Yes, I do. What a lucky guy. Have you ever seen Edward Jones every Wednesday? No. Come on. I saw Raymond Scholar win a race. What's even saw Donald Brader winner race, but I think it's about 10 years ago. I'm serious. I am both. It's just amazing. Well, everybody's got to make a living. You know, they got a little hauss out there and the how about Richard Kent half and 56 and four. Look out. There he goes. You're going up there, half my brilliant. No, I wish I would have been. I might have been. But no, I would have lost some money. I think Mark Metzger had two winners last I didn't. Yeah. Not for me. He's got a Donald Brader school at Vernon Down. He is. You know, Rayne and she led her to life time. She's better and he is. She goes to I once and a while. She actually comes into money. Sue. I had Michelle. Michelle, like I said, Michelle Sue. Michelle, you know, it was so long anyway. I just have one question. Do you have old hardest horses? I did years ago, yeah. I thought you had preferred you. Indeed. Detroit. Yes, sir. Yeah. Well, as matter of fact, I used to go to the Montelia soup kitchen for dinner, so that should be an idea once I got into it. It was fun, but a little expensive. You know, it's an expensive game. Because I think maybe they I had to. Yeah, something like that. Have a nice life film. 12 30 a Wild. We have an open line in Broward 5249463 524 Wild. And there's one on the star line at star i o d star i. How come I never have that cart in their all day? Did I got so much of the Southern cramp going every time I ought to play a card I got like. There it is. There's our favorite. W i d at 12 31. Let's take one in Miami. When is this? It may go. Yes, man. How are you doing? Fine. I've never called this before. Well, isn't this exciting? See how painless it is already? How are you? I'm doing great. How's about you? Pretty good. I saw the godfather. Yeah. And I have a dumb question. Okay. Who is Eli Wallace? Which one is he? He is the old Don do Spag. The guy who's with the cane who's kind of like the snake in the grass, the old man who gets up and runs out when it before they have the big hit. He's in any goes to the assassin to take care of Michael Corleone. Oh yeah. The guy that eats the canolees. Okay. Yeah, one canolee too many. Well, when to go see in the theater. Yeah. And it's soon as Capola's daughter came out. Somebody behind me. It's a couple of guys started you know, laughing instead of about ugly. He was. Yeah. I thought it was so funny. Same thing happened when I saw it the second time because I've got everybody prepared for this I know. So soon as she comes on they all start tutoring and puking and going up their popcorn going nuts. Well, continue doing your favor. Sure. Anything for you. I'm looking around for the Soundtrack department one and it is discontinued. Yeah. So if I send you a tape, did you tape before me? You bet. Thank you. And in fact, remember the guy called asked me that, which is where you got this idea from? Yeah. Never sent me the tape. Really good. So you're first online. Thank you. Okay. Bye. Have a happy. Hi, everybody together. Here we go. I could have been a contender. Not so wrong movie, Marlon. Come on. 1232 a WIO day. We have an open line. That was a great movie on the waterfront with Eva Maurice St. Legia. Legia Cobb onto the greatest actors in the history of film. How come Bill Cosford never talks about Legia Cobb? One of the great actors. He was good in effort. He was the police inspector. Do you see exercises? He was great. Remember the scene where he's going after the priest to keep trying to drum some information. He says, answer the question father paranoia. That's my favorite one of the favorites. Next to of course, the scene where the bar, the priest are in the bar. And they're playing rambling man by the almond brothers in the background. That is a great scene. Even Chuck Meyer, he lost his mustache during that scene. It's fell right off his face like Jerry Colona. Remember Jerry Colona? Dead a alive? Good one for you. Excellent. What was I talking about? Legia Cobb? Dead a alive? Not even Warmani, more Legia Cobb. Very dead. But a great actor. tremendous. Outstanding. On the waterfront. I could have been a contender. That's all I remember. And then it was Marty. What do you want to do, Marty? And what do you want to do? That was like for two hours that's all they said. What do you want to do? Who is in Marty or in his board nine and somebody? A bunch of folks. We have an open line of date counties 751 war 751 9463. Hey, what do you want from me? Okay. I've got the national football. Let me ask you this Chuck. If we were about to play the world series, the pirates and the ace for example, don't you wish? And we were about to go into war. Okay. Play about play ball. My kind of guy. Like I said, that's of course the credibility of our news department ladies and gentlemen. Just got a real good insight into it. 751 of Killa Bastards is our number in date and we'll be right back. Like a consumer problem and Jack Atherton and he does a good job on channel 4. But he's kind of like, doesn't he look like people used to look in the 30s? Not a bad looking guy, but he looks like he's in the wrong deck. He talks like this. Yeah, he's all the time. Does he? But let's put him on joy. What 07 who just declared chapter 11 by the way? Do you know that? Oh yeah. The whole company did. Chapter 11 over a joy. I want to say I guess there's no joy of 107. So he's going to be on track after it. Yeah, it's going to be on for me tonight. And I guess we'll take calls, but we're talking the other day about how the whole consumer action thing is kind of falling down in a lot of places. It's a great way to get stuff done. It's a great kind of featured to watch because you learn stuff and he may be doing a best job. Yeah, TV and he does. Did you see the number they did on by-wise one day last week? Yeah, why? They did a wild number because they've been tried to buy the TV set from the add in the paper precisely. Oh man, and he injected a nice job. Yeah, and followed up on it and just had all this stuff right out there. So he'll be pretty good and as I understand he listens to this station and he's, you know, he's kind of a fan. So it'll be nice. What do you mean by that? Everybody. You know that doctor is why do I keep calling him a doctor? Steve Greenberg on six is he a doctor? Yeah. Oh yeah. Well, I guess is he related to Fred shots? No, but Steve Greenberg listens and that's where he found Jeff at PizzaLawton is why we're getting the fillings out of their teeth and put him on TV to give him some more publicity which they need like hemorrhates. Pretty late. Yeah. Yeah. So Jack should be okay and then I've got this other guy on who has done 50 ways to pave over the earth and you know, we're all pretty involved. It's going to be a good time for it by the way. Exactly. Drive over to Baghdad. Exactly. It's going to be eight lanes no waiting. Yeah, all green line. The new auto bond. And we also have the dead-erolive playoffs again this weekend in preparation for the football. I would pencil in not for this week but like in about 10, 15 days. I put a sawd on Hussein on a list of the real life. I think it'll be real good. Yeah. You see the Iraqi calendar. Yeah. And you saw that the Baghdad weather forecast is for partly cloudy 2000 degrees. Exactly. So yeah, all of those jokes are making the go around. You know, they aren't going to get bombed in the dark ages. You do understand that. Well, you know, you did you hear Rick and saw. I was on with Rick and Suts for an hour yesterday. Yeah, the only reason I preface that is because I said I don't believe there will be a war. I really don't know. I don't. You think Perez the Quayar is going to uh, as I'm going to threaten to unleash all the Mexicans on Iraq. Is that what's going to do it? Well, Perez the Quayar and who's saying don't get along anyway. I guess he's a bash to saying in the past about human rights and they don't get along. But I just think that there's there's time left and some cooler heads will prevail. You know, I think there's one at a time. You must be. I think I'm the only person who believes that but I really do. You see what happens when you're a pirate's fan and you're like to pull against the reds like that. Don't say anything. You're speaking to spring. You realize it's just a few weeks. It's incredible, isn't it? And we didn't have spring training last year to speak off. So it'll be really great. Right. And it seems like only yesterday that the cubs choked against the uh, giants and the pirates choked against the reds. So the day before yesterday when you come to the back. I can't wait. Well, the cubs are going to be great this year. We are. They are. All you have to do is get at least one picture back. Well, you know, Belaki could make a unlucky. He would be like, uh, he could be anything. But that's scary with Bel and Dawson in the same outfit. Yeah. I mean, it is. They dug into Sendo. I hope they never had like a three way collision in the outfield. Nobody else received a sensor again. Yeah. I'm worried about the pirates there. They're too cheap. They've lost. Oh, so spring. So many first baseman out there. They could have gotten and they didn't get anybody. And they're going to they resigned Carmelom Martinez. I saw they were doing a one of those on a satellite. They were interviewing Bobby Benea. I got to be honest with you that he is out of uniform. He is a bright. He's a good looking. He's an intelligent guy, articulate. And in uniform, he looks like Buster Brown in the uniform. It's two sizes two small. It's like a goofball. Yeah. Yeah. It does. It's true. On camera and off the field, he's really a funny guy. Yeah. Yeah. Real perceptive. I hope they keep him. He's you don't go. You see, you've got to have some you've got to sell some tickets. Yeah. See, that's the problem. I wanted to bring up something about about the watch. How about the watch? How does a bush league thing? I know, and basically I agree with that. But, you know, do you realize how many cities had trouble selling out their playoff games last weekend? Philadelphia needed the extra day to sell out for them. Yeah. But wait a minute. Philadelphia needed the extra day because they had the same deal we did. They didn't know until like a couple of days before when it was going to be. Those fans are fanatics and they usually sell it. How go didn't sell out until like an hour to be for a deadline. They had 1200 tickets like exactly. And they just sold out. But they did sell them. Yeah. No, is the argument, well, they're so used to play off that they can't get excited for New Orleans in a wild card game. I don't know. Maybe that's an argument. But the fact is that a lot of cities have had trouble selling out. How many people did soldiers feel C64? Was that on? Yeah. Why is that not used to be a huge stadium? That's in our cake. Well, you know when they built that place was like over 100,000 seats. Yeah. They cut off what I was thinking. Yeah. Oh, they cut off their end. Yeah, they cut off their end. I think Tom's at that problem. All right. He, I feel sorry for him because he's like lost. He had a couple of good moments in that game and against the Saints that's all you need is a couple of good moments. But you know what the giants are going to do then? You think they're going to eat them up? I eat them up. I mean, I mean, all they got to do is show off. And that's it. That could be a real physical fun game to watch though. There is a pretty weak. But if they had hardball, I might have a shot. But do you remember years ago, soldier field was the place, remember when they used to play the college all-star game every year? The NFL champion will play college all-star. It was a charity game in Chicago. And one year that game was lightninged out in the third quarter, they had a huge rainstorm and there was lightning hitting all over the stadium and they canceled that game in the third quarter. It's a little soldier field trivia for you there. Oh. Like I said, Jack, Catherine is going to be like a pressure, pressure, fret there. On, well, we're just killing time deal baseball season. That's all. Well, I thought we were killing time. So I'll do it. No, no. I got, we got a lot of calls here, but I just wanted to give it because Jack, Catherine is, he does a nice job. He may not be rick-senses, but at least the people that who he is and it's a, but you may not let people call in and do their things. What is a purpose of going to be here? Just a shield for his show in Channel 4? Absolutely. What the hell have they done for us? That's all the program. Well, let me point something out to you. I do this thing every year and I don't look for any publicity and I never get it, so I'm not disappointed. But we raised a hundred, we're going to go over 110,000 for Camelasouse. Do you think that's worth like a 10 second blip on a local newscasts? I can't believe that there hasn't been some coverage of it. Zero. Nobody in this town could do zero. What I'm over here ripping the hurricanes after that, and the right away they send a pet to Harrington Jr., whatever his name is over here, I'm right away to my own, yeah. But Ampton, it's just a sad. It really is. Congratulations on that incident, like because well, thank you so much for coming. Well, thank you so much for coming. But look at the, the numbers you went way over last year and you were gone for a while anyway. And I thought it's nice. I think because we did so well, I think another couple of weeks would be deserved right now until baseball star. People should have told you. No, I mean, not, I mean, vacation. Because when I go out for a little while, it starts to sympathy. Do you want to do the spring training circuit this year? Go to some some other games out of town or just going to hang out and fortlaw it down, root on your favorite Yankees. In other words, you're asking, do I go to spring training games? Yeah. I don't go to spring training games. I don't do not interested. How about Mesa Arizona? Is not. How about a Neil Miller? Where's Trip to Mesa? Oh, that would be great. You know, that's a good idea. You know, but who the, I want to go to Mesa Arizona spot. How close is that? There are things. How close is it? 10 miles. Oh, so it's like a suburb. Exactly. Oh, that's not 100,000 people. Great. They got a dog track in Phoenix. They do. Yeah, much else. Don't know if Turf Paradise is still open. No, oh, yeah, it is. One building. Yes, it is. I was opposed. Now it's reopen. Yeah, your paradise is open. Phoenix is nice. Good thinking. We could go to Steve Stone's restaurant out there. Yeah. You could go up to Pinnacle Peak over in Scottsdale. Chomp on some steak. We could talk to all the old yentres and Scottsdale and Sun City. I'm a little bit hungry. Oh, I think. Good idea. All right. Thank you, Chuck. Chuck Meyer will be here with a dead-of-relyte. I'm who's saying on Saturday. Dead-of-relyte Phil Salzburg, ladies and gentlemen, is on a phone from Carl's. Is that a call from Rochester on line three? Hello. Hello, are you in Rochester? Sure, I haven't been down in arms right now. Now, come on. It's pretty good. Are you cereal? Yeah. Are you calling? Emmer's game last night. Are you calling us, collect? Yeah, sure. You're a whole bomb, won't you? Yeah. Okay. Here's a guy at a pay phone inside Don and Bob's in Rochester on Monroe Avenue. You're on Monroe Avenue, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. Yeah, hold on a second. See what I discovered. There is line six this dead. That's good. You hear that click? Because I punched two at once. Hold on a second. Okay. Okay, no. Don't go away. Okay. We have an open line in Broward, one on the star line. Star IOD. Let's tell you, speaking of horse racing golf stream, home of the Florida Dirty believeable. Right, sir? That's true. Yeah. Really unbelievable. Incredible. I would buy you a few white huts. Yeah, sure. I had to play that yesterday. Oh, yeah. Well, what do you eat right now? You haven't lunch? I had lunch. Yeah. I had a bacon cheese burger. Oh, excellent. Oh, those cheese burgers had done in Bob's are the greatest in the world with hot sauce and grilled onion. They're related to the hot. God. Unbelievable. Right here on Monroe Avenue. Right next to Brighton Element. Right next to Brighton, primary school, actually an elementary where I went. I went to school. I went to schoolers. You can you believe that at elementary school there? You went to school? Yeah. Unbelievable. You can look out the window and see where I graduated elementary school. Are you excited? Man. It can't take it. Oh. Oh, listen. Come up here. Messman I want to an emerald game. Yeah, great. Unbelievable. They take kill the thing I'm a stranger. Good. What was the score? Seven. I love it. Unbelievable. It any Chadwick was in goal. I'm more than a thoughtful game sadly. Yeah. I put my phone on that. See the ticket. Now what's the weather like up there? Right this moment? 26 degrees. 26? How much snow on a ground? Not much a few inches. No, I'm talking about the snow. Oh, seriously. You got a few inches and that's not much. No. Really. It was a trick though. No, I'm talking about the snow now. You got like five six inches of snow on a ground? Yeah. And it's 26. Now what's the forecast? You know? Uh, it's supposed to be snow where they heard it's going to be in the mid teens with a game sadly. And this was it's snow flurry's um Friday, 90's it. I'm not sure. Yeah. So about like it is now then. I'm sorry. So it's going to be about like it is now. Yeah. Nice. The bitter windy little snow flurry here in there. Right up our alley. I think maybe Jim Jim Kelly might a lot about what? Yeah, that's thing Jim Kelly might trip over a snowflake. Yeah, I don't think so. Are you a buffalo fan? Huh? You're not a bills fan, are you? Oh, my Oh, is this thing all over 20 years you said you're just crap. Hey, I sat to that crap in the good old days when cookie Gilkrist and Darrell Ammonick and Jackie Kemper, they're when they were in the old AFL. Those were the days in Buffalo in the old stadium. That's right. Those were the days. That's one. That's when men were men and women were thinking about it. Well, listen, have a great time and root for the dolphins. We need your help. I will. Okay. Take care. Call from Don and Bob's man. What the hell more could we want? Right? We hear from Phil Saltman, Hank Goldberg and Don and Bob's like in succession. Are we doing it or what? Not in Palm Beach, though. And I don't really care anymore. I'll be honest with you. They've turned me off in Palm Beach County. You know, you can give me all this crap. Oh, everybody up here in Palm Beach. Yeah. Oh, a bunch of deadheads. Okay. All right. Now they could redeem. If somebody will call on the Palm Beach line say like this is a Jenny in Jupiter would be good. 655 Wild Jenny. Jenny. Oh, it's zoomed far. Okay. I want somebody to call on the Palm Beach line. Jenny from Jupiter. Come on, Jenny. We need ladies in Palm Beach. 655. Not Wild. Now Jenny. No. Who is this is Frank? Frank from Palm Beach. Yes, sir. My call speaking. Right. In a mobile in Palm Beach. Yeah. Wow. I just came from the stadium. I got tickets for braves and exposes and the reds are coming to town. Yeah. It's like great. It's only one a month and a half away. Yes, sir. We're going to be doing our spring thing. I'm called. Be flying. I am ready. Listen. I got the bad news, though. I got the next week's sports illustrated. Yeah. And Dan marinos on the cover. Oh, geez. Are they what they try to give us the canary? Every time. Every time. I wish they'd cut that crap out. They must be bent on a bill, huh? Well, you heard it here first and I'm not too happy about it. But I could like to know. Don't tell Danny about it. Okay. Keep it a secret. Okay. But okay. Bye. Hank by the way tonight's got the I owed cheese when he was I didn't have time because we spoke during the break. I should ask him about Dave Barry. Did you notice in Hank's promo Hank was like floundering you try to find something to say about Dave Barry? Hank you read it just said that twerp. Dave Barry. See, the reason Dave Barry's going to be on because he writes for the Harold and Hank's agency handles there and Hank's great and all of that. But he probably feel sorry for Dave because he's so short. Anyway, boy, we got some good. We're going to go over 100 9000 to the we're already over 100 9. Today, just incredible. So please, if you haven't got your best in the old tape yet, get that 20 bucks check or more in a mail this weekend. Like today tomorrow and over the weekend. And then Monday and Tuesday, we can open up a gigantic amount of mail and really go way over the top. It's been just unreal. Speaking of unreal, Elaine had tourists. Okay, how about the little loan board? Here's a guy made $20 million in one year and blew every dime of it. What a guy. Not too many people could do that. Well, a lot of people create. He had those bitnaught. Earth a kid. It's like the rest of it. Who was it that earth a kid bit on the lift? Do you remember that story years ago? No. She's with some famous person and earth a kid meant she bit him on the lift. Kind of like the scene in the godfather three where he bites the guys ear off. I like that. I haven't seen it yet. I think it's interesting when people like bite bought body parts. Yeah, depending on course on what part it is. Who was it? Yeah, Trump pretty player got hit and the lip with a brick. Remember that owl? Elhert. Yeah, he did. The sound hurt. You bet. You bet your sweet ass. So I just stopped by to tell you. It's been about 10 comments. Yes. Bill Cossford has great taste and radio, but movies. No, it's nothing. Well, first of all, I like Billy's friend of mine is good guy when I see a good guy. But totally bogus. He doesn't live in this town. He lives in Jersey almost all year. He's never here. He's either a film festival or in Jersey. Oh, really? Secondly, he knows nothing about movies. Thirdly, he writes these reviews based on pseudo intellectual crap, not on what the average viewer would see. So the best thing into with Cossford is the fewer stars he gives the faster go went out and see it. Well, I took his advice. His top 10 list. Redic crybaby last night. Oh, man. Wow. That's why I stopped by. Now, I'm curious. How many minutes did you last before you put it in the part off position? Part two is on tonight. If I can make it through. Part two. I couldn't make it through last night. I just couldn't make it. Oh, I'll hold things. So in other words, you know, you don't keep that. You're going to watch old thing no matter how bad it is. It was blockbuster. Sure. You know, it went up in two nights. But I was, wow. What a movie. The worst with the pig tails and the stupid gross. Like hatchet face. Yeah. No wonder he liked it. He likes all these bizarre and gremlins too. He's into the crap. Camp. Yeah. What it is. Yeah. Like can't be like the midnight thing like the events that we'll throwing the Rocky Horror picture show. Exactly. Can't. Exactly. Well, I think because if you look at the people at the customer hangs around would like George, what's his name? The movie guy, George Capewell and all these silly people. I think is the up there. They're camp crowd. And somebody out of the center to the camp. No, I haven't really watched Johnny depot. I can. Good. I know I show one morning. I do run waxing. We have a great time in all these teenage girls were calling in and getting your hormones were just exploding. I imagine. I told him the wife's in there. Yeah, he's good. Look at him. He was like right over on the other side. Yeah. Well, like I've said, he is a good looking guy. But the interesting thing about Johnny depot is that he is, um, remember the, not the news picture in Rolling Stone. But once before they had a centerfold of Johnny depot, he looked like a woman with an earring and like a straight. He looked bizarre. Well, he has like got a pretty face. No, I don't mean that. But I mean, he looks like different people don't worry. He's an actor. Because he won't out make up. He, on a different day depending on how he gets out of the sack. And I guess who with when Ona or somebody else, he just has these bizarre things. Well, he's that's what's bizarre. Because I told you I saw him in that interview. And he doesn't say two words. He's like this James Dean real quiet. What the day you were working him on the air? I wasn't ripping him. What I wasn't. What? No, I like you. What the comparison was is he such a great actor. I can't see this guy doing what he does. Well, that's why they call it acting. There are a lot of people in show visitor. How about Marlon Brando? When's the last time you saw him say anything? He's like a humming him in Michael and the chicken. But he still kind of plays those same roles. He doesn't get animated by Johnny. Johnny Depp was singing in this movie and I mean, he's just in a content. Just totally out of character. But what a movie. Come on. I'm really curious what all the big deal is about James Dean. You know, over the year goes to show you that the world is so much cramped. Well, memory, you know, it's it's out of James Dean first of all. Wasn't all like great look in number one. Number two, he smelled real bad. It was a lousy dry. And number three, he was a slob. If you read, I mean, he was just a, oh, yeah, a good dry real. And matter of fact, what we're going to do to save a lot of blood. Oh, seriously, what we're going to do is when we have this last minute meeting and they will have one. We're going to send Ted Kennedy and, uh, there he is James Dean Jr. Overdo what you need to drive. So I'm who's saying to the meeting exactly. And that would be good. Because we're a lot of bridges. Ted doesn't want any warming. You know, I hate to say this all my life. I've been a Democrat. I don't hate to say that, but I have been and I've been watching this week. Like, someone to see span Ted Kennedy and some of the other, I can't think of the moment of some of who they are. And the, and the Biden, of course, who can't remember what his real name is and where he went to school. But, uh, or who's speechy stole last week. And they're just infuriating. I mean, what the hell do they think this is? Like, we're going to, let's have a debate for about 20 or 30 days. And we're the hell, they've been the last five or six months. Okay. And we got like 4,500,000 people over there in the middle of the sand. And they're like, oh, gee, I don't think it's way to a little while okay. And you can't do anything with that. I'm not going to go into it. I'm like, it. Well, I didn't want to yesterday either, but these news conferences kept interrupting things. So we lost the flow. Just went with it in your right. Not the time to do it. It's not like they can't hear. Yeah. They don't understand. Well, then they're too busy doing something, making vails. And then that's Ted's to read about the two live crew albums and all the stuff that they have on sale over there. Over where in Saudi Arabia, but they like, thank you. You're that sheriff Nick, man, get on the first plane, baby. What the bizarre part is is they black out the cleavage and they black out all the women and all of that. So that's another thing. I mentioned this a few days ago. No, this does bother me a lot. I mentioned it during the holidays during Hanukkah and Christmas school. These Saudi Arabian assholes, I mean, we're over there to protect them. So I'm could probably wipe them out about 30 seconds because there are a bunch of Indian cathols and all the shiks who got all the money in the rest of Marlequin the dark ages. And here we go. We put all our people. You know, the rest of the world is standing behind us and hey, we're all behind you. But you said, oh, you're beautiful. Right. And we're all over there and we're putting our hands on the line. And they're going to tell us, oh, you can't celebrate to this. You can't, they're out there in the middle of the desert. What the hell is it there business? Is that a British? They're kissing our feet. They ought to be bringing mususes and crosses out there during the holidays. Do everybody celebrate. You're right. What a bunch of as a courtesy. In addition to which all is $50 billion windfall that they got from gushing up all these oil prices. They're just sitting back, wow, well, here's about $10 billion for right now. And, you know, we'll see what happens. See how well you do. But they were going to pull two life crews out of them off the shelves because somebody seriously just told them what it meant. What they were saying in the album. Yeah. They blacked out the cover. But they didn't know what the album was saying. So everybody was buying it. And they say, oh, the oil means that. Yeah. So they're going to Well, in Saudi back to Saudi Arabia, they still think like mother is a member of family. Let us sit and sit over there. You mean sheriff, Nick? Exactly. 114 to WIOD. And let's talk about our good friends at Papadau Park. Now I know you'll be out there tomorrow night. In fact, the lights went out Monday night because we heard the rumor Rick and Spuds were coming out. We didn't want to lose any money. So we cancel a race in the morning. How much did you guys lose of color Friday? Not too much. Totally the one race. I know when to stop. Okay. Probably not again sooner. I wanted help. And I got it. I didn't have a phone. I had five winners in panning. But he was picking him like crazy. Well, let's always say, shit. Listen, I told you I walked out next to a guy who won 140 bucks on one race in any left. And he had to tell me about it all the way out to my car. Yeah. Screw him. Anyway, we don't like wise guys who went and talk about it. Tomorrow night in Papadau Park are 610 WIOD. Papadau Hardest van Rick. Because I may in the paper address it at a future date. Oh, she's why don't we want to say to you to make you understand. Stop being a hothead. Stop being forget about Tom Jika. He hates you like poison. He doesn't like your show or even if he did like it, it would make a difference because he's got a personal thing with you like a few going. What do you care? Why do you care? The odd. See, that's another thing. Yesterday, I came to this realization. The audience doesn't care about all this other silly crap that was going on. So why should I, you know, get sucked into a bunch of crap that nobody cares about it. And the same thing with what you're talking about. Nobody cares. And you're away sting your energy. Life is too short to waste your energy. Okay. You're not going to manipulate him. And the more you start sticking your nose in and make it a big deal. But the more hard head of he is going to be in, the more you're going to have like a big thing. Is that what you want? No, not at all. Then for you know, something going. What? By mentioning it now? Go I'm not. I mean, it's it's common knowledge that you guys like hate each other like poison. But I don't hate him. That's the problem. What do you stop it? Yes, well, hate you don't like him. You just like him a lot. You think he's a jackass? Well, exactly. Okay. Well, I don't like you said it that way. 21 after one, we have an open line on a star line where somebody probably Tom was on star line just drove off the road. Sorry, Tom. You're okay. I like Tom. He's full of crap sometimes, but I like him. I'm not going to pick up things with him because he doesn't like you. I don't do that. I like Tom a lot. Even though he's usually full of crap. Kendall. I hate you. How are you doing? Okay. I'll share him. Make the world with this a frimp. There's a listen. I'm like, at least. Listen. There's room with you on Lucky. Well, that's not it. Where is it? I'm least. Yeah. Excellent. Okay. Thank you, sir. 21 after one. It's WOD. By the way, I forgot to announce we just went over another hedge. We just jumped another hurdle. 109,000. 176 Dolars for a criminal sounds. 109 plus. Boy, we're going to do 110. Unbelievable. I just switched to Dallas. Two days. The 15. Well, I picked that because I know it was a major date. I wanted to tack along for the publicity. I think we got a better chance of making 110 by Tuesday than Saddam has a scene next Wednesday. What was it appropriate, date? I think that's why they're based in their talk. Isn't that? I'm thinking doing like a movie on Eddle so far for the heat stars. And I'm NBC. I think this week in Dark Ages. For Darkshadows. A lady in Carl Springs probably your wife, hello. How are you doing? Good. How are you? Great. At the listening, there's no way possible that we can afford to get rid of. Fast and steady. Yeah. Am I going to be caught in the middle of this now? I don't even pay any attention to dolphin Danny. I mean, I mean, I go there and I build up my own enthusiasm because I'm enthusiasm. Excuse the die heart thing and there's far few and in between. Well, that's true. You know, we can't afford to lose one of them. I don't know about the die part, but the other part is I'm a single mom and my little boy wanted to go to this game real bad to play off game. Yeah. And I took off work early, went down to the stadium, but two tickets, parking ticket, and I'll tell you it was we had a bad. Oh, yeah. I thought you were going to give me some story that you couldn't get there or something. I'm glad you were there. It was one of the greatest experiences of anything that has ever happened in this town. I realize it's only a game in its force, but even so it was one of the most positive things that's ever happened in this city. Absolutely. Absolutely. My little boy has to put up with jet fans at school. I mean, I think it's the only bath in fan there. But well, tell him that if you ask any friends in school or jet fans, if they're smaller than he is beat the crap that you're right. I hear you. Listen, do you know how much it comes to a good old game at rich stadium? Other than a playoff. Somebody showed me some tickets they had. It was 30, but well, it was a playoff game. There was 30 bucks, but that could be like an enzo. I have no idea. It was 30 bucks. Okay. I already want to go to heaven. Okay. Thank you, Nanks. There we have it in enthusiastic dolphin person. That's what we want tomorrow. I'm just letting it all hang out. I really mean it. I mean the dolphin. Oh, we might even play Cory. Now you're going to put him on again. I'm glad you're in here now. I mean, I don't want to chance guys you take the task and sound like Tom Jickie and heat. Oh, what the hell is it with you and Cory? You got a little something going there. What is the deal? A kid. Cory is on a pain in his hands. He's a pain in the ass. Take a pull on Cory and stick him on it. He's half a year. Run him up. Yeah, it's like it. Oh, thank you. He won the bat. He called yesterday. Remember I was asking about dolphin enthusiasm because on the bat line. I wonder, do you think a fat rich game in the bat line number? Who gave him that number on the bat line? Got me. I mean, sure. I don't even know it. I do. And here it is. Oh, I'm serious. What's the deal with more people could be like dolphin Danny and and Cory? We'd be fine. If more people were like Cory and dolphin Danny, we would tell us that I'm with saying he's got a pretty good point. We say, okay, we surrender. Here's how this is life little bulls. I sure return to surrender. You know, tell him this is like the ultimate fan dolphin's underfront bulls. See, Cory has nothing to do. So he wants to be like a task. And even at the remote and calmer, Gilbert is starting to really, I mean, all the other most Gilbert puts on a show and we kind of keep him on a leash and he's okay. We're starting to get out of my mirror. Cory is kind of our Gilbert. He gets on people's nerves. Oh. I see. I got it. Do you get your card from Africa? I showed it. Hands up. It's a fouly. Yeah. It was a fun to follow. It was fun to find. It's fun to try. He was an animal he saw. Spying on to fire. Get it down. I'm starting to sound like him now. I wasn't even put on an act. That was just a scary market. Markets up 21 points. Look at that. How come is it? We're getting closer to war. How come the markets going up? Boy, yesterday's lucky. You got it. Well, it was going way up. When the talks were still going on because they all thought something then as soon as he came out and said, no way, Jose, right in the old cramp. Well, I need to come more of those talks. I'll put a bunch of money in it. Yeah. If they'd like to think I don't. When the number starts with the minus in other words, when they pay you to take the stock, 126 to Wild, where Cory will be on it to a clock with Rick and start. I need to make him the idiot on the corner. Isn't he? Instead of Marvin. I mean, Marvin doesn't have to put on. We're not doing it. I think it out long. He's pretty funny though. What? Well, I just noticed that's been on there for days. I know. And it's no longer applicable, okay? No. Well, what was the word that Bush used yesterday? Oh, man. He did a number on a word. Obfuscation. Obfuscate. Well, how the way he said it? It's obfuscated. But he said, oh, obfuscate. They're trying to obfuscate. I said, I've heard of watergate, but obfuscate. That must be a new was scandal. Obfuscate. You better watch how you say that. No, seriously. He said that. I know. And here I'm sitting there and everybody's watching him. It's a serious thing. And a world is like spinning on a cradle like a hang by a threat. And a president comes on and says obfuscate. The other day they're going to have a super world. From the damn quail school. What? You think they're going to have a super bowl if we have a war? I don't understand the question. Maybe they ought to do that like on the fort. Why wouldn't they have a super bowl if we went to war? The war could go on for days or weeks or months? Do you want to every serious? Why? Do you want a serious answer? Because who's going to want to celebrate with the loss of lives that we have if it goes on? It's not a tie to super bowl. It's a celebration. Let me ask you this question. Was Vietnam a war? And went on for years, everybody got used to it. No, they didn't get used to it. With the longer it went on the more they protest until they finally come to the frame. But my point is why were at war? Like Korea? With Korea war? Yeah. Did we stop all this sporting events and everything else? We had super bowl then. We stopped super bowl. Baseball? Did we stop the world's war? I was in the live. No, we did. Yes you were. What do you mean you weren't alive then? It's 51. I mean I was born in 51. Oh okay. Boy, I wasn't socially conscious at that time. So what are you just waiting for? So what else is exactly? I think you're full of it to be honest with you. Well thank you. I just I don't see the connection. I mean the fact that there's things going on I don't think we'll have one. I think the American people would cry out if we tried to have one. It's taking you have a super bowl of celebrate when we're losing our people over in the. Well if that's the case then why aren't you on the air every day talking about World War 3 and about the Middle East? No, I'm not going to do it about it. Exactly. Exactly. I mean that's the part of human events. It's ongoing. It's happening. But if there is nothing that's going to change and I think that if we all become more, but you're what do you mean it's too close? Super bowl worth February. All right. So let's call the White House and say start in Vade on the 28. Exactly. That's what I said. Or Super bowl on the port. I'll see if Baker and Aziz could have come to agreement that fast yesterday. We'd have this whole thing live. Well let's us go over there. You first never mind. I think that little shrimp in Israel is going to take care of everything to be on. Shotcast some good point yesterday. Did you listen? It's a shock. Shamiya. Well he said he reiterated them with you. Have you ever seen him in Bob Mayer together by the way? It's a shock. Shamiya. Who? Now what is it Chuck Meyer? Yeah. Who's got what's his name from Channel 4 on? On Sunday. Yeah. Oh yeah. What? Saturn. He doesn't think it's going to happen. He said that here before. Is that where you heard it? Yeah. No, what I just said. Yeah. He also said that the guy they picked up was not the Gainesville murder or two that they had a money. I was wondering. So I didn't Chuck Meyer in here anymore. Anyway it's one twenty. That's just a little joke. That's just a high right. Well I saw through that. All right. Let's take a call or two these people are probably foaming at the mouth. Miami. No. Yes sir. How are you doing? Do you think we should cancel a Super Bowl? Hell no. Okay. I don't think I think people need something to get their mind. Exactly. I mean what are we going to do? Sit around wearing black and be in mourning all of that. I was played over there. I don't know. Yeah, let's play it in the bag day. Yeah. The desert bowl. Yeah. There you go. I don't know. I probably have that last year. Look it's taking me a long time to find you. I moved two years ago and I came back and used to be on Zeta. Yeah. And used to have that guy with Yiddet. I used to call up on them. If you remember, make fun of his lap on the night. The bird. Yeah. Yeah. He was always phony. So you're here now, huh? I'm here. I've been here for over two years. Okay. Now let me let me tell you a question. And let me answer you an answer. Yeah. The reason that you weren't able to find me is because this station has no concept of what promotion means. And so our big word is that news weather and traffic which every other AM station in the history of radio is also had. And they don't tell you that Reniri and Rodgers and Rick and Suds and Hank Goldberg are on the air in the sports people. I just keep us secret. Do you want to go to Red Chat? So you have to go out there and kind of fiddle around and you find us. Yeah. And I'm glad I did. Right there in the Red Chat. It's written you're the middle one. Yeah. You'll love this. So anyway. Don't deal. Yeah. Let me give you a little bit of a cup tidbit information. All right. All right. Now we're talking about great first basement. Yeah. You've got a brother named Kevin. Yeah. He's going to be the new third basement starting this season. Are you serious? Yeah. The typical Pacific Coast League last year. This is name Kevin. Kevin Grace. That's right. The Pacific Coast League last year. This is name Kevin. Kevin Grace. That's right. The Pacific Coast League. That's right. And before the game we can say Grace. That's right. The Pacific Coast League. He batted 285, 26 home runs and he was a gold glove. Because I always wondered you know he's Grace slick. Great. First one all right. Come on. See. It's one thing. It is. There's a lot of failures. So. The round one. There's a bunch of the home out of the year. I want to wave love to have with you. And so we'll get lucky. Yeah. What about you? You like to send the one time I feel? Yes sir. Doug DeSendo should be our center of fielder. Stick that you're all moulting in the desert. No, all of you just hit a home run. What happened at the wake Smith? I thought they were going to trade whitesmith because he had a terrible year this past year and he seems like lost out there like the land of the lost. But maybe you'll make a big comeback. Maybe it was the sophomore jinx. The sentence was like a backman kind of guy. He just sends oh is a great fielder. He's a clutch hitter. He slaps that ball around and he's good. He's like a great. You don't want to now it fell in Dawson. You don't smash an into make a pizza out of him. That's true. Well great talk to you again and go clubs and go to Austin. They need to play a five man line and do anything against Buffalo. You're a great American sir. Let's send you up there to do a little pass for us. Little blitzing this week. Well blitzing definitely. Okay. Have a nice one. See you. Little blitz, Creegan Buffalo. That's what we need. Stick that Jim Kelly in the desert and don't give my math. Maybe give him a razor blade. 132 a Wiod. We have an open line. Look at that boy. We are sizzling today. This is incredible. You are going to have a show this afternoon. What's the story with Marvin? Is he all aired out now since his 40 week vacation aired out? Is he here even today? Is he out on the road again? With Charles Corral. All George is hoping. Huh. George, let me make your day. That he's here. He's going to be out. He is? No. He's going to be here. George Hates. George says. Well how can you blame him? He's going to sit through eight hours of prayer. I know. That's a fate worse than watching. We'll be with Johnny Depp. What's up with the private baby? Oh, who? garbage. What's up, Johnny? How come it is? Now, Johnny Depp he made private baby and falls in the middle of the. It's a burger. Yeah. Cis or hands. Yeah. How come he can't like just be himself on there. Just take some clothes off or something. I mean, why is he going to be all dolled up like some goofball? That's right. Short. What is that? Who deal? He's going to be a goofball. Lining when he was on our show and he had a leather jacket on. He just come from a some bar with Greg Alman, who was calling around on his hands and he's throwing up and couldn't make the show. God give cry baby thumbs down. But I think he's doing it. Greg Alman couldn't make the show. He was like, he had only sheer pictures. He was scribbling on. Oh, he was going to be on your, it's a, well, they, they were out together all night. And somebody arranged to bring them in. I mean, this was like at 6 30 in a morning. They, he was on. Do 10 Johnny Depp. And you booked Greg Alman at 6 30. No, he didn't book you. I do five. That's you. God. Yeah, yeah, but Greg somehow will fill out of the trucker. So yeah, exactly. Years ago. Yes. I'll 134 at Wild and we'll be. It's time, Jick, a listen to by the way. We'll be right back. The 205, the staff, they only got the idiot on the corner on the sheep, but not on the show. Hey, if you can't be on the show, at least be on a sheep. You missed the party. That's what they say in Davy. Oh, yeah, they had a little party last night. And of course, my luck, I started my nutrients system yesterday. Oh, I had to do. I had to do my blood sugar was much lower this morning. I feel much better. I really do. I mean, like a measurable difference because I was starting to become like a Dave gaming and feeling it. Please part of it and a stress from that horse that's still running out there. And Alan, think of some calls. They're going to look and they've looked into that. They're going to take care. I just don't want to get into a whole thing about that again. I don't mind losing. I really don't because I'm used to it. Most of the time. But when all the horses start going this way and mine is going that way, that does bother me a little bit. We'll call me quick. I'll give you some money for me. We have an open line in Dave, 751 WKYT. So I mentioned the party and you started talking about horses. Five one. Well, I figured probably a lot of horses asses there last night. Well, anybody show up? I heard it wasn't much. So it wasn't the name you brought up with when I was I was talking to last night. Oh, was she? Yeah. Oh, man. Plastic. Plots.
