I'm a cut man. Highfly ball, the sense of cut is where? Cut man. And a button man. As they think the incentives has collapsed, evening of the series by the store at 6 to 1. And once a gambler of 500 marks, it's 29 and 29, a chance to go over by winning the finale on the stroke trip here to the final game of the series. I trust you, Arthur. One in seven Americans suffers from a terrible affliction and while others find it funny, to those who have it, it's no laughing matter. It's called frequent burping syndrome. It's terrible. I'll be on a date or a business meeting. And... And... Excuse me. See what happens? Frequent burping syndrome. It can ruin your life. But it doesn't have to. Now there's a clinic that can help. Trained specialists sensitive to the needs of compulsive belchers. A special place known as burp inders. Gosh. Burp inders saved my life. Joanne and I were in love. I really wanted to ask her to marry me, but I just knew that when the moment of truth came, I'd let out with a big ripper. Burp inders. No shame, no guilt. No more tummy rumbling, smelly belches. No more stopping in mid-sittance to uncorporca big cheesy blaster. Just caring professionals. And the help you need. Don't wait. Here's the number to call. I'd buy five, two eight, seven, seven. That's five, five, five. Burp inders. Call today and stop being so gross. Okay. I'm thinking about giving away maybe like $20 million on a shoulder day. Okay. The first person who calls. It's Tera. Ha ha ha ha ha. Ten o' wait. Wiod. It's a great Thursday. The birds are doing it. The sun is shining. Man are we doing it. I said I'm thinking about it and some going to do it. And I got to tell you this right off the bat. Not to be sucking around because you know how I feel. I've mixed feelings about the whole sports on beyond. Here at 610, your sports up not just station. But last night, sunny Hirsch and Joseph Gack. He hadn't even hanked. But especially sunny and Joe Routin, California. Such a great job covering all the goings on at the baseball. I mean, he's always just tremendous. It was spying tingly. And I have a right from the horse's mouth that Mr. Heisinger. Mr. Aseeky. No, heisinger. Was it whatever the hell his name is. Wayne was listening to Wiod. He just pended that radio last night on because that's only place he could find out what was going on. And we got it. I mean, the National League says unanimous were on favor. Any marketing. Yeah, my mean, Denver is fine. But we want to bleed a little more money out of the whole deal. Okay. So let's piss everybody off. But it's done. There's like maybe one chance in a billion that we're not going to get major league baseball here in the course no in this town. Anyway, in a front page of the Sun Sentinel, I know this is going to get Stan Worthheimer crazy. Are you out there, Stan? Is he on the phone yet? You know he's going to call. Mr. Casino gambling. Casino gambling group pushes 92 vote. Wouldn't that George was saying earlier? And he's not even much of a sports fan to say the best. But can you imagine Major League baseball and Casino gambling? All in this God forsaken talk could like transform this from a sleepy, dying over here place overnight in a couple of years anyway. I don't think it's going to happen. But in addition to which there's a conflict there because I have a feeling that will be one of the excuses that will be used. Another one is if they need new ones, you know, about the mob's going to come in and a crime and all is in disrupt our early bird dinners. But now of course they'll be saying, well, you know, we got a major league baseball time. They don't want that kind of atmosphere. We don't want like a Las Vegas ambiance and lots of gambling because God don't. Unless we how about if we had Pete Rose's manager? That might not be too bad, huh? But anyway, it's his Casino gambling group pushes 92 vote. They're going to try again one more time. I hope that I wish they just put on the ball at every two years. And just keep jamming it down the throats of the people these kneeanderthals in the state to lay finally. I just got so tired of resisting it. Okay, go ahead. Just don't try to drag us in there. And you know, the amazing part of it is the very old farts and the pseudo right wing religionists to whether one's who claimed to be against it. Maybe the first ones in there. They'd be online for 10 miles in every direction. Just like when you go to Vegas and you see all these other backtests having your convention out there and all these other pseudo religious groups. They're all out there doing it. Doing anything they can get away with. So I'm sure that Stan Warthheim or Mr. Casino gambling is going to be a year we get up now. You're a great guy, Stan. You're a wonderful guy. A little ponderous, a little one dimensional. Tomorrow nights are a big baseball fever night. Flag day. Big night at the Miracle tomorrow night. We hope everybody comes out to any more about that later on. A game is at seven. I'll be there at six fat rich. It'll be there and Rick and Suds have been kind enough once again or Dumb enough to adornate their presence. They're they're just incredible. They just keep coming back for more punishment. No matter how much they're abused and maligned by the sales staff and set out on lost missions. They just keep doing their thing. And then Saturday, of course, Saturday morning, I think down to Benson camera. So we got lots of stuff coming up. We also have the WIOD slash coast frequency flyer. Which is our little in-house news paper. I got to tell you something. This thing is started out as like two pages. Now it's bigger than the Wall Street Journal. I mean, this thing is just gigantic. It's mammoth. Almost as big as our staff. You know, as you leave through, I'll get into some of the names here. There are people mentioned in here who are now working at this station. But you know, 75 people work at in research. A Georgian to happy body says they pay him like 30 cents an hour. And the nail is assing that chair like eight hours a day several days a week. So Marvin, go out and play professional jackass. And we're here at all these other people. They must all be unpaid aren't they? Like the interns. See that? That's the way they like to do it. A Cox broadcast. And we have 400 employees. But 380 of more interns. So they don't get paid. Okay. We have an open line at Broward 524 and Palm Beach. We had a little thing on there. What are they? Line checkers? Line checkers? Come on Steve. Go sell some more spots. Speak it upon. Be twice in here this. Patty wheat owner of the 17 store. Patty's place. Only sexy things retail lingerie chain. Now has another problem. Can't raise her sign in North Palm Beach. The county that made Rocks and Pulitzer and William Kennedy Smith household names. Voted last night. Not to allow Ms. Wheat to hang a sign outside her newest store. The same sign found outside the other 16 locations. It includes the words Patty's place and the script beneath reading. Only sexy things. Tuesday's vote brings to a head. The monthlong controversy surrounding Ms. Wheat's new store. And it made before the new store opened at 767 North Lake Boulevard. Let me say it again. 767 North Lake Boulevard. The Palm Beach post refused Ms. Wheat's grant opening add as to suggested. Patty's place quickly attempted to purchase radio commercials on Palm Beach radio stations. WIRK at WRMF. Again, the grand opening ads were turned down. Finally, only WIRK accepted a sanitized version of the radio spot. Meanwhile, Miami radio personality and first amendment defender. Neo Rogers of WIOD. Sheer devoted portions of his May 17th show to the controversy Palm Beach. A listeners called into report and read massage parlour ads in the same. Sanitized Palm Beach post newspaper owned by those phones at Cox Enterprises. Ms. Wheat has battled fiercely against those who would seek to regulate or banish the marketing and sale of legal products. She'll appear at the July 9th town council meeting with her attorney at a bunch of whips and chains. In a related development, listen, it gets even better. You're going to love this. West Palm Beach refused to allow an occupational license for the Backdoor bookstore because of assumptions based on the store name. Zoning officials finally visited the bookstore at the owner's insistence and realized the gain lesbian bookstore is located in the back of the building and is most easily accessible via its backdoor. The Backdoor bookstore now has its license. Wow. That's Palm Beach. So that's why we're taking that stupid line out. Okay, we're sick and tired of all your right wing knee-andethills. We got enough of those down here in Dayton, Broward. We don't need the just this hole. It's just like a never-ending cacophony of repressive knee-andethall old farts from cemetery villageets and Yahoo's. And phony Yahoo Rednex. They remind me of the people up in Nashville. Oh, the Bible says the Bible says in the meantime they're doing everything that moves. They're cousin, they're sister, they're brother, both at the same time. That's their motto up there in Nashville, incest is best. And yet in the meantime the Bible says we're all going to rotten hell. Well, I got news for it. The Bible's right. It's going to be pretty damn crowded down there. I'll tell you that. It's going to be like dying and go to Tennessee. 1028 at W.I.O.D. Let's go to Kendall. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. Did you happen to get the, uh, salvation locker room last night from the ball? Well, I told you about the balls. I told you weeks and weeks ago it's a year of Michael Jordan and the balls and all these Laker fans and all these other Celtic fans. I don't know what they're talking about. This sounds like the I hate the bird guy to me. Is this the I hate the bird guy? No, I don't hate the bird. Now you said doesn't he sound just like the guy I hate you come on you are. I'm at the second time car. Okay. You sound just like the guy we did. That's a compliment. If you missed the Neil Roger, you know, I'm not going to be a little bit more. I'm not going to be a little bit more. I'm not going to be a little bit more. Okay. You sound just like the guy we did. That's a compliment. If you missed the Neil Roger show yesterday on 16 Wild you missed this. This is the bird. Yeah. Bird, how you doing? Okay. This is do me a favor play anything because I can't stand listening to you. You sound like a douchebag. Do I? Do me a favor play anything. Well, can I ask you a question before you go? Oh, God, you sound so stupid. I hate to talk to you. Yeah, go ahead. Why did you call me? I didn't call you. I just said, you're not to say anything. Just play something. Oh, God, can't stand it. Well, then why are you listening? I play something already. Why won't you answer me? I can't stand it. You won't see he won't talk to me. Well, I don't know about you but you sound like some stupid idiotic. I'm stupid idiotic. Pop it out. In hell. Yes, sir. Since Mr. Huzzingi and Sisson call on the team after a search. Why don't we call him Miami-Jufe. We sure got him down here. Ah-ha-ha-ha! There we go. Ah-ha-ha! Yeah, okay. So you mentioned Nashville. You get an Asheville young who won a full right away. Oh, that's right. It's Thursday. It's almost time for the sheets here. Hello, again. I'm Mikhail Iszir Snook. And now we're proudly present. A very special episode of... ...Rust of Peace Theatre. In this story, we take Margaret Mitchell's classic tale of the old South. And transported to a Caribbean milieu. It's a three-part series entitled, Gongja with the win. As we join the episode one mum, Ah-ha-ha-ra, a very aromatic roster ferry in name, Rage Jackson, is forced to choose between playing in a Jamaican steel drum band or regrettably spending another year on the bench of the California Angels. Well mum, quite a dilemma for our new being friend, eh? He with the Wuppy Goldberg hair? Ha-ha-ha! So once you slice a mango and join us for... ...Gongja with the win. On Raster Peace Theatre, I'm the white devil. Mikhail Iszir Snook. Anyway, it's 1042 at WOD. At the big sheet sale, I was talking about only moments ago. She said a little small one. You can wrap your parrot or parrot keyed in. It's called a birdsheet. 18 to 11 at WOD. It's interesting about that phone. It's 6 and 8. Maybe those are the numbers in the double today. You think so? 1054. Let's go to South Miami. Hello. Oh, no. Yes sir. Listen, you're talking about these old puke stuff in Palm Beach and every place. My father and I do bar signing it, you know, private parties and stuff. Well, this we did a party in a church. And you want to talk about hypocrites. You can talk about the Catholics. Because I had to go to the bathroom. So I put all the bar bottles underneath the bar and went to the bathroom. When I came back, they, I mean, these people, they couldn't get enough booze. You know, when I come back, I mean, you know, like 10 people around the bar behind the bar. They're picking up bottles and just free and pouring. And they're saying, oh, she's the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, You know, cranberry. You know, tomato juice. Can I make a bloody merry? Yeah. These people are unbelievably. Body is the word for it sir. And they're just, I mean, it's that tip on Neil Mike Disney syndrome. Oh, my god. They all got liver like, liver like a rock. Any. It's, they go. I'm telling you. It's unbelievable. And you know, we have all of these rainy days all through the summer here. So what it's pouring outside, they're all poured inside. That's my own. I'm like Disney. Another thing I got to tell you is a store cable. Oh, I mean, this, this is, I mean, I mean, I thought this was America. Not a story cable. Please. I see if you have a store cable, it's more like Siberia. Well, store cable, I got the bill. And I put it on the bottom of my bird cage. Mm-hmm. And oh, in other words, it's like a bird sheet now. Yeah, kind of sort of. And after the day is done, then I'll mail the bill back to him. Come and come pick their box up. The cable satellite came back by yesterday. And they are offering. They're, they're, they're very, they're good people. Cable satellite came by and for 1395. Yeah, but I heard the quality sucks though. Somebody called and raven about that and, uh, heard that, There's no stereo in the pictures like upside down. So don't get to excited. Check it out first before you go getting sucked in again. Um, what I did was I went ahead and ordered this. And I was able to satellite. And it's 1395 for all the basic channel. Plus you get free showtime for life. Yeah. And free sports package for life. Now this is what they're offering. It's 1395 plus tax comes to 1479. Mm-hmm. And so I'm going to go ahead and try it. If, you know, the bill goes up to $14.80. I'm going to have to put the bill under the bird cage again. You know, for the birds have something. Well, even if it is a crappy service, at least, your canceling store will piss them off, which is a definite step in the right direction. Oh, store is. He works. They're the all-time worst and Jim Bozo over there. I'll live up to his name. Oh, and you call him to complain about it. And it's, you know, everybody over there is like walk and talk and wreck them. Yeah. Some believeable. Mm-hmm. So anyways, I think that's where I'm getting baseball. And you got a good show. And good luck to us all. Thank you very much. Thank you, sir. New from a makers of America's funniest home video. Bob's taking his back. Feeling sorry for the senior citizens. It's America's funniest home accident. I'll get it. No, I feel. Oh, oh. Help.

It's more than just boo-boos bloopers and practical jokes. It's real life. Oh, oh. How cute. I'm falling in a cage, you know. So the next time you see an old fart ball, don't help them up. Catch them on your camcorder. For America's buddy, you know, how old maximum? Hey, my pickup a great camcorder. It bends his camera the Saturday during the big tensile. I'll be there, love him to two. I'll segue into that. And we have some exciting news, now. Now, let me just kind of move around a little bit. See if this works before I get too carried away. Thanks to Mitch Ween, our illustrious chief engineer. I got a sucker-rong as he signs the checks. Isn't that surprised you all the different people you were assigned to pay checks? The burdo signs a checks, too. See, he's been here long enough. The deal is if you've been here more than like six months, you can sign everybody's check. We have a new microad, how do you like that? A yellow one. Once they once tied up Joseph Gackie in this, by the way. Sunny once tied him up at a baseball game because he was just making a terminal. And just stuck him under third base. We have two open lines in day, 751, WIOD. I have yet to get to our big. What do we call this thing? This is the frequency flyer. You know, anything that's called the flyer, you know, goes in a circular file right away. And here at WIOD, can you imagine him out of time and effort that goes in? And they might have, how would you like, how many of these do you think they make up about a hundred? 200? Well, with all the new people we got working here, I'd say about 300. You go through all the pages of this thing page after page about our company picnic and about this. And that would you know, some of it's okay. And every other page has got a whole list of please welcome this one and welcome that one. I'll see you at Gordon in research department. And Todd Goddard also in research and George Sarkees in research. And Mike Saskin in food marketing. And we got like 7 billion people who work here. Now here's the page they like the best because these are all the interns. Well, I don't think they're all interns. Mike isn't an intern. He's a part-time board-off, right? Would you think he's the only one of these guys gets paid? Wouldn't you think he'd afford to wash his underwear? Oh, that was Mike Grayson, by the way. I didn't know his last name. Now we know it. Now he's out of the closet. Mike Grayson from FIU. Ha ha ha. Mike Grayson, though, washes underwear. He dropped his pants in here yesterday. It was the most disgusting thing we have ever seen in our lives in the underwear, too. Currently working as part-time board-off at WIOD is a major in broadcast production at the 10s FIU. And he even speaks English. How do you like that? Ha ha. Joey, ever like Alex? So, well, let's get back to Alex. Alex Rodriguez, we know Alex with a long hair in the ponytail. We need to haircut. Melissa Mandel from FIU, majoring in print. Who's Melissa? George, who the hell is Melissa Mandel? Marketing intern? Do I know her? Have I seen her? No? How come Marie and Heather aren't on his list? They're probably not going to stick around after Adam, a pinned him in the wall yesterday. Joey, ever, also, like Alex from about her college, Adam Kirchner, who was in here only Moe brings in the male, very obedient. He gives me anything I want. A 10s University of Miami? See, I know nobody's perfect. He's a good guy, but he attends you of him as major as communications. Oh, God! Get serious, Adam. Ok, no one is always laughing. Graduates, the end of this month. Well, congratulations, Adam. Ok, and just to get a real job. Wendy March will be joining our staff of interns June 12. She's a law student at UM. Honest to God, it just goes on and on and on. We got like 50 billion people here, and they're always crying and We're all like we're making money, no matter how much we do, we can't make any money There's AM and so expensive. That's my opinion. I'm like Disney. Yeah. Well, maybe if you cut like 60 of the deadheads off the payroll, we might have some money around here for everybody like George overworked and desperately underpaid. And got a good attitude and spite of it. Most of the time. He wants an award as Saladis. We have an open line of date, County 751 WIOD, here's a lady in Fort Loderdale, who says, Hi, Neil. Hi. My name is Kimberly. I mentioned I want to remotes over at, I guess it's the bizarre for on 31st Avenue and I want to something. Yes, man.

The ROC ECC. Bend down with no apology. I can't be tied to the record. I can't be tied to the record. Don't. Don't. Know what it's all about. The ProTech's shoot. The building wants to see you. All right. We'll take condoms. The division of black flag housing garden. That's the old division. Keep in situation safe since 1887. The WLWD, we have an open line of brown, which is like ugly sitting there all alone. 6, 5, 2, 4, WLD, Pemberg Pines. Neal. Yes sir. That's a new tape isn't it? No. That's a new one? Ancheon. Never heard that one. Old. It's been a long time since you played that one. Yeah, but weak. I can't remember. Anyway, I got the lead sunrise pig. Don't have anything better to do report. It's on your neighborhood. That's on your reason. You know how you get on. The fog raps and sunrise. How you get on the sagrassial? You don't have a little intersection there. I had a blanket light there. There's sitting there to see if you roll through the stop. Oh, Jesus. What? That's just a desperate you're right. This is seven dollars ticket this morning. It's a may and I, you know, like, Grindelett accident there. What is the S.F.H.P? Sunrise. Sunrise, poli. Ooh, that isn't my neighbor that lives like butter block from me. Is it? There was a young guy in a blonde hair, another girl there. A young guy with a blonde girl? Yeah. Good cop. What were you like, pick her up on sunrise? I was just like, wow. How about rolling on true man? Who's he kidding? And you have to look one way you look at no prize. I was, can you get back any cup ask the questions? Well, you have any questions? Like, no, just give me the ticket. Yeah. Far where you are just rolled on a window and shot. I'm dying on the hair. That would do it. Hey, and I got one prediction. Yeah. Well, this is fancy stuff here. Yes, sir? You know who's going to end up in Tampa Bay Saint Petersburg? Houston Astros. No way. Yeah. I don't change. No way, Jose Houston. I think it's going to be the pirates. Craig Bezier. They can't avoid him at E.D. It's going to be there. Eric Yelding. A Yelding. And a cast of students. Casted Yelding. Mark my words. He asked Rose. One more question out there. In a rainout game like the parking yesterday, does anything you do in that game count? No sir. So the home run, Andy had no sir. Why is it's right? Washed away. Wow. Washed out with the tide. I'd say that I would. Like Natalie Wood. What does my kitty said? Oh, right. What he made doesn't make any sense. It's not. In other words, the game has to go five innings to be a game of record. So if they played like eight innings. And the game was complete like they had gigantic tornadoes and thunderstorms. They had to like replay the whole game later time. The statistics would all count. But if it's less than an official game, then it wouldn't count. Well, learn something every day. There you go. Ask the experts here when it comes to baseball. I know my ball. Okay. I have a great thing. Singular. 1031 1131. Well, it's 1031 in Chicago. It's good enough for me. Oh boy. I knew every time you leave the house in a morning, I think boy, I forgot something. Not every time. I forgot to set my VCR. I mean, the first 20 minutes of the co-game today is not going to be on that tape. They could be behind like 17 to nothing by the time I get home. And it was pitching for us today. Is it Scanlon? I guess. And I'm going to say it again. Jim Sien makes me sick. Poor Mike Polakia. I guess he don't like his new haircut. He's seven and four. He got bombed one game. He's been our best. One more game. Does anybody have to staff the game he lost to the dice? Should be eight and three at worst. At worst if we scored him any runs. Back to the ballpen, Mike. We got all our Yahoo's. We got less line cast. We're going to ruin him again. Now he's finally pitching good from the bullpen. We're going to ruin him. But we're going to ruin him. But we don't want to talk about the cubs. 1132 at WIOD Miami. Nail just called the recon firm. A little spary point that I heard. He heard you be going to Chicago on the 11th. Yes sir. 11th of July. Unbelievable. We might be flying together. Well on midway. Scary thought. Are you around the midway? That's right. Well that's great. Oh, the cow. Yeah. Only you're probably paying for it. That's right. Well we're not. Actually I'm not. Good thing. We're not there for a trachio. Great. Well we're going to be up there. We're leaving right after the show on that Thursday. 11th. We got a Houston game Thursday night. And then Friday morning we do our show at Murphy's Bleachers. And then we rush across the street for the next. We got four game series this time. It's going to be great. Especially against the cream puff team like Houston. We should win at least three. Does this mean I'm going to get to see Uncle Meal in Chicago? Could be unbelievable. Uncle Meal. How's it going? By the way, Mike. How's it going? If you come to Murphy's Bleachers when we're doing a show they're trying to get in. Yeah. There'll be a nasty, surly guy standing there at the doorway saying you cannot come in here under any circumstances. So that's my opinion. So how do I do like Disney? How do I get through? You don't. How do we get in? It would be Disney. Always my name. You can't get in. Just tackle them and take them over to the show. It's taken me there with Steve Stone. Who can busy? We'll have to be knocked for that. See you. Take care. 1133 at WIOD. We have an open line in date. Counties 751 9463 751 Lagrangna Ranch is God in the kitchen anyway. Here's a lady in sunny Isles. Hi. Hi. Next Wednesday I'm leaving for Las Vegas for 10 days. Wow. Are we going to run into you there? I'm dying over here. Just Mike. Oh, I hope so. Because I go on vacation next Thursday. Right. And I'm hitting all the high spots on my vacation. Well, higher low. I hope you have a great time. Yeah. But were you going to stay? We're staying at the Flamingo Hills. Not bad. Oh, okay. Because I thought that was being kind of cheap. No. Are you serious? That's a great spot. Oh, all right. You've never been there. I was in Las Vegas all maybe 18 years ago. When you were like a little child. Oh, very little. Well, not that little. I was walking into the hotel and Joe name it was behind me. And it was the day of hot pants. That style for girls. Yeah. And all of a sudden it was hot pants and boots and tight. And I hear someone's voice say, oh, those are really nice boots. And I turn around and it was Joe name us. Are you serious? There he is. Did he ask you if you could come out and play? Well, sort of. Because he talks baby talk. You don't know that. Oh, I hate the way he talks. Play. I love to get him and Bob Kuzi together. Between the two of them, they both have such incredible defective speech. It would just drive you nuts. And Tom Brokow. Yeah. But Tom loves the president though. 18 years later, I'm going back to Vegas with my husband. We're going for a convention. We're going to have a booth out there for four days. But it's also going to be our anniversary next Thursday. So I need it a really great restaurant. Happy anniversary. Where is where? Where's it going to be? You're going to be in Vegas, you mean? Yep. Oh, you got to go to the Rhapsody. Oh, OK. That's like the best one that you can do. Well, it's, uh, I wouldn't say it's the best one. But it's just a great, the atmosphere is great. And the, uh, May 2 days about 100 years old. And he makes the bananas faster, right? Be sure and get the bananas faster for dessert. Well, let me write this down. OK. And the major days about 700 years old mentioned Neil Rogers at W.I.O.D. in Miami. And also, oh, yeah. When is he coming back? Wow. Tell him I'm coming back when I can eat a meal again. He's not there 600 pounds. Well, I die at every day of my life so that when I go away, I can eat like an animal. Yeah. You'll love that. Um, and then there's that great in the top of can, right? Yeah. OK. And there's that great Italian restaurant and Caesar's that I can ever think of the name of. But somebody will call in or remind me that's supposed to be just phenomenal if you love a tattoo. Oh, I do. OK. And we also want to try and see the palace station that you've been talking about. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Casino. OK. No. I mean, it's not like a fancy place from the outside. It looks kind of like a country in Western Yahoo place. Oh. It's nice. And the buffet upstairs is really great. Brand new. It's tremendous. Now, do people get dressed up out there or? No. Just for the shows, but not for anything else. They're dressed up. You'll see cowboys and, you know, just I mean, anything between sloppy and the dress up. OK. That's very important to a jappy little girl from Miami Beach. Yeah. Well, you don't have to worry about impressing anybody. OK. Just because they're all too busy. Not going to pay any attention to anywhere. They're all too busy losing their money. I have to do. I'm a well, I have to 10 days there. I hope I still have a house to come home to. Yeah. That's why you don't take any expensive clothing. You'll be tempted to sell it or to get back. I'll have a great time. Thank you. I hope we see you out there. OK. Bye. Mr. Rogers can say what he wishes on the air. I can listen or not. Listen. It's open 42 at WOD. Now Jeff had pizza loft.

And he even puts him on his chest. You know, and now he's now he's bragging that he's done. Yeah, macho man. He's about as macho as Truman Capote and a bad day. I was doing. So yeah. And it's closing. I'd like to say the guys that Jane and G shop. They're all bunches. Ders bag. OK. And you have a nice day sir. See you. 1143. By the way, I'm at Papadau Park last night having our usual Wednesday night. Good time with fat rich. And Susan blood comes in there and the our little private room. I didn't know that Alan Fickles and allowed people like Susan blood to come in there and bug us all though she was on her best behavior because she wanted to get ripped on the ear again. I also did promise the very nice lady who was the cashier and the sulky cafeteria to mention that the food is sensational even better than the dining room during the, it really is. It's great. And she has my picture up on the thing on the cash register so she won't make them a stick again. It's fantastic. The only problem was I was sitting there watching most of the quarter horse races waiting for the Simalcast from the metal lands had the first half of the double no problem abdicated with the great Jack Moiseev. I had an $80 billion double with Moiseev in the second half. And he's deleting all the way from the half mile all the way around and the only horse I had to be Michael a chance with the three horse sitting in the pocket they're sitting second. As they come into the stretch I've got a $50 trillion double going on this and I'm screaming Come on Jack, come on Moiseev. And I hear a voice from very close by me like in my table. Come on my chance and it's that big fat rich. Needless to say Michael the chance comes out and just it just noses me out at the wire. So we'll be serving parts of fat rich is body at the miracle game tomorrow and I don't be enough to go around for everybody. 1144 at WIOD Miami. Hello. Anyhow you doing okay sir.
