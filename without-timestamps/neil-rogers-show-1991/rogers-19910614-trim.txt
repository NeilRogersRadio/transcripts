We take a trip to whiskeyville. So this is Jimmy Mad Dog whiskey, frontier, dumb little kid. Jimmy Mad Dog whiskey's father, Doggy Daddy whiskey. One of the DJ's boy lessons, because he was doing a lot of stupid things. So one summer's day, he gave him $5. He said, now, go out on the town and buy $5 worth of what's what? Jimmy Mad Dog whiskey didn't even think to ask him what what was. And just took the $5 and took off. Soon he came to the apartment store. He walked in. He says, excuse me, sir. He says, I liked to buy $5 worth of what's what? And I said, what? He said, what's what? He said, listen, kid, if you don't know what you want, just get out of here. So he left. Walked into a pharmacy. Excuse me, Mr. pharmacist. I liked to buy $5 worth of what's what? He said, what? He said, listen, little kid. If you don't know what you want, just get the heck out of here. So he left with a grocery store. Excuse me, Mr. Grocer. But I got $5, I was, you know, I want to buy $5 worth of what's what? I said, what? He said, what's what? I said, oh, this dumb little kid. He says, I'm going to have some fun with this little kid. He says, hey, little boy, why don't you go across the street there? There's a brothel across the street. So go over there. They probably got what's what? And so Jimmy Maddug, whiskey, frontier dumb little kid. Thinks his $5, he walks across the street to the brothel. Now, I decided to door. Woman opens the door and completely naked. And Jimmy Maddug, whiskey never saw a woman's private parts before. He says, what's that? And she said, what's what? He said, that's great. Give me five dollars, no. 10, oh, wait. That Wild, your news, whether traffic sports and screwed up station today's the last day on the Palm Beach line. Look at that. There's a call on there already. They must be getting nervous. Starting Monday, 1,800, 9, 4, 4, 4, W, I, D, toll free. For all of Florida outside of Dayton, Broward. Anybody outside 305? Not exciting? Man, I'm getting excited about it. And another edition of, what, eh, today? What if Ed McMan were vice president? Welcome back to my line. I'm Ted Coffle. President Bush. Yes. Which nations do you see as our most favorite trading partners during the next decade? Well, that'd be the Chinese. Chinese. The Japanese. Japanese. Perhaps the Russian. Oh, the Russian. It's not a joke. And I'm not getting on. Well, vice president, like man. Yes, sir. You planned to run for president in 1996, despite the cold reception of your fellow party members. How cold was it? I suck on it out. Yes. President Bush, getting back to the 92 election, many people feel a better running mate for 92 would be general Norman Schwarzka. Well, also, the general receives four stars. Yes, Ed, Ed, I might give him a fan. Who will you affect? Why not give me a fan? Join us next time when we last want to have Jay Leno with a surgeon general. Oh, yeah, sure. Go ahead.

Oh, the police, please, forget about Paul Castro. Nobody gives two flying crabs about him. OK, forget about him. Well, you know, this man since the day he came to town, it's all he talks about as Neil Rogers this and he, he just liked the people on light bulb radio. If they talk about me enough, they're going to get some attention. Somebody might listen, forget about him. OK. Well, you know, I mean, desperate. Desk it. Yeah. It's for worthy cause. Desk it. It's on the blowout of zero. OK, so for cubicles. Yeah. Baby's born with cubicle care. Yeah. Well, you know, I figured, you know, you, how much do you pay you to make this call? No, I didn't pay me. 50 bucks. I heard you. I heard you. You heard it on the radio. You were listening to she. Yeah. Oh, boy, you really need metal helps. So I said, I figured, man, you could take them. Sir, have a great weekend. Wait, can I call somebody to do this? You're right. I have to do it fast, because you're digging a whole deeper than the Grand Canyon, sir. Well, I'd like to call my friend Diego.

Just being the last day. Yeah. You're starting a new thing on Monday, right? Starting a new 1-800-944-W-I-D on Monday for everybody outside Dayton, Brown, outside the 305-A-R-A-Code. Well, somebody else in Palm Beach County starting something new Monday. Well, is it a great? Uh, boom, tell me that PBR is going to be relaying the light bulb. Yeah. Well, we're really excited about that. Yeah. I mean, the thing that we can hear you all the way up to Orlando, Jane don't need to really transmit her up in zero. And now light bulb needs PBR and Palm Beach. And Jane, I was also got a really thing in North Broward somewhere. Oh, they still have that one? I think, yeah. But the one that's got a zero isn't even on the same frequency. You've got to tune up. Well, neither is light bulb going to be there. They're going to be all over the dial. They're going to be all over the dial. And low-powered five-watt radio stations. So what we're going to do, we're going to put a relay. Okay. Have a great day, sir. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. It's... I know.

Well, well, we still have a, uh, decided with him because morning, yet or not. I'm sitting here, maybe sitting in my air conditioner. What do you mean for the air conditioning man to come?

Hey, hey, you're going to be out to the miracle place. Uh, tonight. Yeah. Is it possible to get near you? What does that mean? What does that mean is it, you know, I've been with you since the war. I have not given up since the war. I like you show. I'm listening to you show. I'm a driver. I'll listen to you show every day. I can very rarely get to call. Well, that's what we do out there. We have a table set up and we sign our stupid pictures and write little dumb things on there and give out bumper stickers and we can say, it's going to be that that's what it's all about. That's what it's, uh, that's what we're there for. Uh, I was listening to you yet with yesterday. I believe it's yesterday. Where you told the gentleman, he could take a orange and uh, what in a certain place? Uh-huh. Sir, take a gigantic orange, okay. Peter, and stick it up your ass. Stick it up your ass. Stick it up your ass. Stick it up your ass. That was great. He was great. He's still working on it. He's still working on it. He's still, he's still peeling it. He must have a bigger, he must be a California orange. Uh-huh. Well, he got confused. He got uh, something a little bit bigger. Uh-huh. Great fruit. No, I don't think it was a pumpkin. Pumpkin. That's what he needed. Um, I'm out of material. Okay. I'd like to say that Donald, my good friend that, uh, to Russia, but it's a douche bag. Okay. And uh- Say goodbye. I like a buy. Say goodbye. Goodbye. Oh, man. Woo! 10, 30 on Yahoo Radio. We're doing it, boy. We're picking it. Uh, coral geobals. Hello. Uh, can I stop the nail please? Well, who do you think this is? Neil? No, this is George. What's happening, Neil? What's up? This is Tony and coral geobals. Hey, Tony. Uh, let me press this my club. I say, and I'm Hispanic, you know. Uh-huh. Um, and. Well, I don't want to frost you a little bit. I can idea for a name for the, the baseball team. Tony? Yeah. How do you host? 10, 33 at WIOD. We have autopsy line in date 751. I'm telling you, there might this got to be something in the water in this town. Because it's not like isolated. It's like the whole town gets it. Like we'll get like 10 in a row and it all would be just like that. Two-op lines it, Broward. Hey, listen, we're going to hit the carts real heavy today. I got a whole pile of stuff here. Let's, um, let's break one of these out and see how these, how these were on the machine. There's a whole bunch of these. This is how we're trying New York. The recent he way, front on by global warming has had various disasters. This just hit from Hollywood. Michael Jackson has melted officials at the scene reporting all of the classic, next to a whimpering chimpanzee. Now because all the things plastic are in danger of melting, fire officials are now installing extra smoke alarms on the set of live with regis and catholic. I'm Tom Roach. Say cool, everyone. Miami Lakes. You're missed the Rogers. Yeah. Once for all, what is your stand on life goes? Stand on this sir. We have an open line in date, 751 WIOD, West Palm Beach. Hey, New York, how you doing? Okay. Palm Beach Post is playing. Oh, I got to tell you, I'm going to take a nap. Palm Beach Post. Well, we thought like the last couple of days, it's always here about as the damn Palm Beach Post. Get rid of it. Don't do it again, sir. Okay. Don't even put it into your bird cage. Just as some close and Steve came here. Oh, that's even worse. I don't care. Nobody cares. Nobody cares about a little 251 station with a bunch of little amateur hour people playing radio. It's in with dead air with a bunch of, it's just pathetic. It's embarrassing. I'm sorry. Don't do it again. Now you know why we're taking that line away. See those people up in Palm Beach, their idea. They really believe that they're the hub of the market and the rest of the world revolves around them. They're kind of like the sun and the rest of us are on Uranus. And they really believe that. So they think when they talk about talk radio, oh, Jeno, you hear what the leaf is following in today? You hear what, whoever I don't even know else is on Mike Miller. Who nobody here cares? It'll be like somebody from some little station on the edge of a long island calling it a WABC. Oh, you hear what? I had a rock and fused it today. Nobody cares. Nobody ever heard of them. Okay? Nobody cares. So that's another good reason to be getting rid of, even when it line does ring at least. Most of the time I assume it will not be from Palm Beach, which can only be a big improvement. Palm Beach. Hello, Leo. Yes, ma'am. Will we be able to hear you anymore? Why not? Well, you said you were going to taking it out. Especially during this call, I'm putting it away, believe me. Oh. What do you mean? Well, I thought you said we weren't going to be able to hear you. I didn't. That's not at all what I said. I said we're taking the Palm Beach phone. I want to speak to you, Lord. This is Marley from Channel 7. I'm taking the what? Who is that? Marley from Channel 7, calling Lord assessive data with the Harold? We're taking this phone line out. Replacing it with a 1-800 number. But that doesn't have nothing to do with the reception on the radio. Oh, you'll be on Monday. You bet. Okay. Now I'll be on Monday Tuesday and for a couple more days. And I'm going on vacation. Oh. And then I'll be on on tape and I'll still do it. I've been listening. I listen to you all the time. Well, bless you. And I miss you. You're not going to miss me. I'm not going to be gone. I'm going to be here every day. All right. Did you? You've got it now? Yes. Okay. Bye. Oh, help. Help. The water in the White House. For a while, it was suspect. Then it was tested and found to be pure. In fact, the purest water on the planet. Introducing. Robin to spray. 100% refreshing. And let's taste. It's good. It's good. And rate my lips. No side effects. Listen to what your fellow Americans are saying. About clean, pure, capital springs. Last week, thirsty. Did the prudent thing? Try capital springs. It's good. So good. Made my eyes bogged out. Try the other bottle of water. Bad. Capital springs. Good. Why capital springs? Because research shows 68% of Americans will swallow anything that comes out of the White House. 100% pure? No side effects. Capital springs. The trickle down treat for your thirst. Capital springs. What's purest age to all? Drink this. 1107 at WIOD. We have an open line on the star. I'm starting to kind of like go wake up. Maybe they're in the same thing. Maybe it just went around town. Is that possible? Maybe they all woke up at 2.30 also. And watched the weather channel. Pop it out. Pop it out. I'm going to just cut them off. I like misfire there. Well, too bad. Call us back. You probably have nothing to say anyway. Coconut Creek. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil? Yeah. How are you doing? I'm doing okay. Listen. You were wrapping yesterday about that. Stir-way to heaven. You know, gig. Yeah. That's in fact. Get ready. And can I have another reclown? Jesus. Or the docks, too. Yeah. What do you mean another request? You know that target. Have a vote. Why don't you just list out. Why don't you just list out about 400 of them? Yeah, that Larry King. He says, low me $50. Is that low me $50 or low me $50? Go on. Slow me $50. Well, I'll have to listen to it again as a matter of fact. Low me $50. You just talk about no life. Yeah. Well, get a hold of yourself, sir. No life at all. Man. Member of Pines. Neil. Yeah. The ultimate of ultimate scumbag pig reports you could imagine. Yeah. I know you don't read the slum sentence, but this one you have to pick up and get. Club Nick. As you do. To my bread that is unleaven. Yeah. Club Nick. How are you ready? Did you? Mm-hmm. What do you think of this guy $52,000? The tax is here's money. Yeah. Is this guy on Belieu? You know, something sir. We can sit here. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And you know something isn't going to do a bit of good. He's still there. He can run from now until the cows come home and he'll still win overwhelmingly every time they love them. You know what? The order they are in Broward, the more they love them, the more right wing they are, the more they love them. He's just an institution that he's just like the emperor. You know, the one quote that I love the best. And that's why they had to spend all that money because the emperor had no clothes. The one quote I love the best in this is the finance director Michael Woodruff told a reporter. The allowance is to be used for whatever an employee wants it for. I'll probably spend it on clothes for me in my wife. So just think about that, you know. We're only just spent $500 for him in his wife. I like that the $500 for me in my wife, huh? All right. All right. All right. Even for a good time and really for next couple of days, right? But he's doing it again. Uncle Neal. I got to tell you. If he isn't the skum, it's the pigs of pigs. And all you BSL pigs out there listening, I know you love Neal. You got the skum bag boss. Neal enjoy yourself and regularly and have a good time. Long me $50. Our illustrious news department, a bunch of big fat slabs in there are sitting around trying to figure out a great way to disrupt the show again. Now that the war is over. And we have another space shuttle landing. Coming up, which I know everybody in this audience is sitting right on the edge of their seat waiting for that. Yeah. Can't wait. I mean, we only have a space shuttle landing like about every half an hour now, right? Like it's a real big novelty. And the only reason they want to have it on the air is in the rear unlikely chance the sucker is going to crash. You know that. Because that's the mentality of news people, exploiting human tragedy. They only wish they'd have been at that golf tournament yesterday with a hidden microphone, listening to the groaning and morning of those people as they were getting shocked from the sky. They would have loved it. And so coming up in 22 minutes and 55 seconds, but who's counting at 1137. We have the landing of the space shuttle interrupting this important prestigious highly rated meaningful show. Now this show is about the only thing that gives any continuity to the lives of giants of people all throughout this God forsaken wasteland in which we live. And I will grant you the calls here today have been like about a minus six on a scale of 4,000. But who the hell cares? So we wind up again getting a screwed because this isn't your micro-nery neo-roggies reconcered tank Goldberg station. This is your news weather and ponderous boring traffic and crap station. So every time the president farts, we have to interrupt the programs where everybody in the audience can get a good whiff. Okay, that's basically what this radio station thinks you people listen for. Okay. Now quite frankly, I could sit here and just, you know, how we don't have a lot of time to screw around with that thing. We got like a lot of stuff on here. We're going to get every spot in. Okay. I don't care if we have to play him back to back for half an hour. We're not losing any revenue because of some stupid bogus decision by some big fat pirates fan in the newsroom that we're going to put on this stupid space shuttle landing. Here's a lady in Miramar. Hi Neo. Do you want to hear about the space shuttle land? No, not at all. I guarantee there is, is there anybody out there watching the hero land? Oh yeah, well him no matter what I'd say he'd say the opposite. Yeah. How are you? I'm okay. I'm pissed. I'm sick of this. I mean, if there was something meaningful going on naturally, we want to be a first with a news. You, you know, put it right on, of course. Well, I have something very meaningful. But let's get serious with the space shuttle landing for the four millionth time. Oh, God. I'm sorry. Neo, I have to tell you, I'm involved with medical sales. And I cover both the Hollywood and Hollywood. Well, get me some doggy downers over here right away. Well, I think it's very frustrating to be driving around and you have to make appointments with physicians. And we have these, Helen Dale drivers that really, and honestly, I have, this is the only gripe I have with them that they really shouldn't be driving. Uh-huh. Um, I was at a stoplight yesterday. The light turned green. I beat the horn a couple times. Well, I didn't turn green. The, the, the, the person in the car in front of you did. You did that or a dark shade of purple could have been dead for 30 years. Well, it was ridiculous. I, you know, I blew horn, you know, once and I'm waiting in life still green. And traffic is going on the side of me. And I'm behind him. And I'm waiting and I'm waiting and he didn't move. And it's, it's annoying. And it goes on every day, every, every day. I'm on the road. I never ending source of consternation. Well, I really think that they should take a look at, restricting licenses of, of, of individuals over the age of 70. Uh, I don't think that all of them have. Get them off the road. Get them off the road. Absolutely. It's, it's, it's, it's. Except my mother, my mother can go to the store once in a while. But other than that, get all arrested, off the road. And we're during rush hour, you know, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's. Well, there's that juicy fruit spot again. Oh, boy. Did you see that spot? No, I have it. Well, it'll cheer you up a little bit. Well, uh-oh. I think Sunny Rosenberg's on the phone right now. Good luck. Thank you. See ya. I feel better now that juicy fruit spot just came on. Oh, boy. We have an open line in day, 751. Who the hell, carrot? Is there, let's go through and find out. Hope sound. Yeah, now. Do you want to hear the space shuttle land? No, sir. All right, hold on a second. Uh, lady in Pembroke park. Do you want to hear it? No. Okay, hold on. Uh, Miami. You want to hear it? Miami. Hello. Hello. You want to hear the space shuttle land? Hello. Okay. Do you want to hear it? No. Okay. Uh, he's thinking about it. Lady in Hollywood. You want to hear it? No, I don't know. Okay. Starline. You want to hear it? No, no, no, no, no. Okay. Starline. You want to hear it? No, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Uh, oh, balaki. You want to hear it? No, no, no, no, no. Okay. That's eight out of eight. We just took our own goddamn telepool here. And there is nobody anywhere in this audience. And it's a watch near the stupid space shuttle land. Okay. Is there anybody out there watching here at? Uh, yeah. He's the one. Right now it's 22 till noon at WIOD time for that space shuttle landing. Thank you, Neil. This is Elaine Hatcher in the 610 WIOD News Center. This space shuttle Columbia is preparing to land at Edward's Air Force Base. And just about a minute, we now join Mutuals, Joe Walson, carrying around for live coverage of the shuttle landing. The sharp contrast against the clicks now just a few feet off the landing. It's coming in just a few feet now from touchdown. Looking very good. Very steady. Low's edging down. Tires just a few feet off. And there's the puffs of white smoke. Right now. Touch the rear. Oh! Tires of the shuttle. Come back to earth. Low's now easing down very, very gently. Very slowly. And they are down. Those gear touch them. This is Elaine Hatcher in the 610 WIOD News Center. There you have it a perfect landing for the shuttle Columbia. We've now returned to the Neil Rogers show. All right. Good job. It's 20 till noon. And I'll see. We went in the 38. That was the most incipit minute and 40 seconds in the history of radio. I hope that somebody sends the time capsule to the Smithsonian Institute of Broadcasting and that was the most incredible waste of time. We couldn't have read that off the wire on the news. Okay. 20 till 12. Let's go to deer field. Hi Neil. How are you doing? Yes sir. Yeah. This is Dave from deer field. Yeah Dave. I've been holding on the first time. Call a long time listener. Yeah. Not then said. Well, I've just, I've got so much stuff going on here. Dave, it's don't feel like we're not happy to have you. We're delighted to have you. Well it's nice talking to you. I didn't listen to your show since the war started. And I just happened to hear the landing too and it was a waste of time. Yeah. You know, they ought to put you on the spot. They do what made you wait for next two minutes for nothing. I know. Eric, Tom is the wheels are tight. They're a little puff of smoke. There it is. Oh boy. Look at that. So what we're going to be doing. We're going to take like three four hours every day because I know people are into these landing. You ever drive by the airport and see like the people that sit the rubber knickers who sit around. Yeah. On the tops of their cars watching the planes land. And of course, a lot of those people would pretend that they're going to be a little bit busy with the plane. And they're going to be a little bit busy with the plane. And they're going to be a little bit busy with the plane. Yeah. That's true. This is long as nobody knows on it. Thank you, Sunny Jr. Hey, my bus told me to call you because a friend of mine that I work with. He's a major douchebag. And I just wanted to relay that to you. Well, who is he? His name is Brad. Oh, yeah. Serious douchebag. Yes, he is. Well, you did a great job, sir. Thank you. Nice talking to you. Have a good life. We got a good salad here from Sunny's right now. 1144. We have an open line in the Sterline. Sterio D. And let's go to Opalaka. Hello. You're Rogers Radio. 16 W.I.A. I do it. Okay. Well, you're that crushing numbing tone of depression. Slipping of the Elaine's voice there when it landed. Oh, I'm shurning. Yeah. Well, as he was depressed, it didn't crash because all those people are the same. They're all a bunch of sadistic bastards. Yeah. I hope the pirates go on a street. And lose the next 45 in a row just to get even. They make me sick. And I'll say it again. I've never seen Chuck Byron Bob Ville together. Yeah. Wow. See you. Yeah. You'll be up there. Is that triple? What triple? ABC or double layer? What kind of baseball is it up there? Popped up. D cup. I don't know. I really don't know. That's why I ask you. Hey. It's just triple A. One A. A. And two A is better in three A's like next to the pros, right? Three A's about like if your foot's a size of a walrus. How do the time pack? 1153. I have got these things just they fall into the door. I have no idea where this came from. This is screening procedures for phone calls on talk shows on WIOD. Another intercepted memo that just I found it on the floor out in the hallway during the break in credible. Did you read this yet? Oh, man. I'll save the best part for later. But let's go to page 4. Sequencing callers. Let me get to the best part. Remember, no old sounding callers get on a year unless they qualify. In other words, if they got a lot of money, they want to send us some of it. Callers should be appraised just before going on the year. Pef them up. Get them ready. Oh. Whip them into shade. Pef them up, George. Come on. Get with it. In those rare instances when calls are few and far between go back and check on the few calls that are on hold. Sure them that they'll be on the year soon. Like sometime between now and next to Lewis. The first call of the hour sets the temp for the rest of the hour. It should be the best possible caller. The first call after each break is also important. I'll get picked the best one to go with it. Which one? Was Palm Beach? Yes, this is Tapy. Oh yeah. You're all picked up. All right. Whip a bit of shape, George. Listen, the next time they have a landing, what you got to do is get a gentleman's salary to do a free landing show. Yeah. That way you're hanging onto the audience and they can do two hours before the plane landed. While they're still drafting. Speaking of Joe, is he still in California? Beats mean. I can't believe they sent him out. They're just a good announcement on the year. I got to tell you something. This radio station, I hate to say this. We lose more money on this sports department. They fleece them out of more bogus trips out of more. Although they did do a great job tonight. I mean that was good. But I mean just it's most of the time. They go on all these bogus. They're basketball games in Hawaii. Yeah. They didn't call a lot of springs and plays that. They haven't been invented yet. I mean they probably spend jillians a dollar every year on the crap for the sports department. Here, they're just a shocking mind bog. He's only going to gain probably about five minutes ahead of everybody else when they make the announcement anyway. Well, he could be in the studio. We want to be on top of it. He sure is he pubbing the hallway right now. I spoke to a lane just before that space shuttle. They went a little screaming match and all she says, I want to be on top of it. And the judge came running out in the hall. So makes these decisions. That Disney? Now Disney, he's not even here today. He's on another, he's on another busman's holiday. Him too? Oh yeah. I know there's six day vacation. Well, I can say is Disney's a douche bag. Okay. And I'm out of material. See you. 11.56. Now let's see. We only got time for one or two calls before the top of the hour. What do you do then? It says don't ever feel obligated to take the calls in the order in which they come. Finally, remember, this is showbiz. You're ultimately the person who can make or break a good talent, George. Give him or her the absolute best selection of callers. And we all win. Right? Uh-huh. It's 11.56. Boy, I feel a lot better. Maybe I don't think I had anything to do with it. But I guess we all felt that way the first hour or an hour and a half. Till that space shuttle landing, that's what got me awake. Think of my juices flowing. High allia. Anya? Yeah. Pleasure to speak to you sir. Likewise. George came on the line there to time pet me up, but I don't think it would have didn't work. It's obvious. What will do the best you call me? Yeah, that would do it. You know what the part of it that did it for me? Which one? That was what did it. I landed at post-notes. When she would they put it lanes nose on that runway, man. People were going nuts. They made a people from CNN were in shock. Anya, not a request or anything. But I want to hear the Frank Sinatra and Anti Reagan bit. Okay. As they say in junior high school sir, you got it. And I believe you're got. Yep. And I want to call my sister Carmen and my brother Ray. Psychotic neurotic douchebag. Okay, those are the best kind. See you. All right. Well, you want to hear Frankie packing. Now, where the hell am I going to find that? Is it back on that thing there now? Is it on that thing up there? Could be. It might be. It is. Wait. I'll help there. Sir, I got news for you. I hope you got a lot of hernia insurance. Bio-records presents old blue eyes on an unauthorized new album called Frankie Packer. Frankie. I'm around there. She just can't say no. That's why the first lady has a dream. Yes, Frank Sinatra is back. And this time he's in the Lincoln bedroom. And the now your end is near. And the so I draw the bedroom curtain. Black Sinatra. The legend. The latch. Around hands and hands. And the secret. And the seat. One was naped while the others and seat. This album is so hot. Even the riggins are smoking. To be do-be-do. Be-do-be. You'll get bitchcraft. It was a very good rear. And of course. And then you'll go and spoil it all by marrying someone stupid like run-ragging. Let me see your moon. And let me send away the guard. You'll get a check out of Frankie Packer. Available now on busy body record tapes. I did her body wave. From 59 to WID. Well, must have been a exciting night for Mike last night. You see how comedy looks today. Relax. Just not the usual hyper over emotional overstimulated jackass that usually is. Very calm. Like you finally got lucky. Check his hand George. I do. I do. I do. I do. Sometimes I feel the light. With my fingers in my head. It's so tough to feel the light. You've met me forever. We are the only free. We are the only free. We are the only free. We are the only free. Don't let your life pass you by. We are the only free. We are the only free. Yeah. Twelve, six. I do. Remember, no old sounding callers on the air. Unless they qualify. You know something? I didn't realize it. But Steve Zimmerman, our brilliant engineer with the shiny head. Steve has already put the new thing on here. And it's we got a little card on there that temporarily. Hello. Oh, Neil. Now you don't qualify. He sounded young. Two old. Two old sir. And also he violated the beat. No speaker phone. Your bad lines. You hear how muffled that was. No. No way sir. Not on it. Not according to our new procedures. Their point must be articulated and they concise manner. No multi part questions. Long rambling questions or long preambles. You know what I'm saying? So probably an easy way. An easy way to determine if they qualify for that part of our criteria would be to ask them much of question. Exactly. No callers over. Now here's an interesting one. No callers over 65 unless they vehemently disagree with a host or guest. That sounds like the contrived kind of thing they do on the light bulb. Or express an absolutely outrageous opinion. There's between the age of 25 and 64 are optimal. Callers under 18 must be extraordinarily articulate. Never air more than one caller 18. What? Never air more than one caller under 18 in a row. Who the hell is he thinking he's kiddin'? Now how do we know how old they are? In other words, you have to guess that. We don't ask him how old they are, do we? He's not even listening to me. I mean, I'm paying the... Is it like, what? Do you screen him? How do we know how old they are? We don't ask him how old they are. We might ask him their shoe size, but we don't ask him. So what is this stupid thing about the ages? Oh man, I'm tarn it. God almighty. I don't want to go into it. Let's go to a Miami and a Starline. Hello. I want to monitor this. This is the paper they wasted on the show. I want to dedicate this call to your news, Crucence, and it's so interesting in the space. So I'm in my truck. I'm applying a brakes. I got 60 pounds of pressure on my engine. My temperatures are 125 degrees in the engine. My air conditioning on maximum. The station is on 610 and I'm in drive over drive. All right. Okay. Good job. Bye now. Thanks. Okay. She said she'll bring her nose out to you sir. The old one. Cross brings. What do I have to offer the show? Okay. Let me go back to the beginning. What is your question or comments sir? I got your offer right here. Okay. Mike said it'll be right over. I hate to laugh at sad things. Did you see that that them golfers think I hit by the light? Oh come on. Now that's growth test. You're laughing at that? I know. It's just, there's side to picture. They're just like, that must hurt like hell. I don't like that. Oh yeah. You think you make a lot of money Neil. Did you see what Sean Connery got for one minute of work? Yeah, a million bucks. Half million. No, a million. No, half million. Wrong. Wrong. You're wrong. I read it in the paper this morning. It must be right. It said a million dollars. Half million. All right. We're going to argue about this whole day. Anywhere. You're wrong. Can you play this this shuttle again? I missed it the first time. You want to hear the best part? Yeah. Okay. Touch down. All right. We're going to do this. 1235 at WIOD. We have an open line in Broward. We're smoking today. Boy, we got off to kind of like a screw start in that first hour. But now that we got our underwear changed, man, we're doing it. We're cooking. We're smoking. Still, cigar. Two. Thanks, by the way. It's a way to gain for some fresh ones. Our last box man. Stale is Grandma's garden. No. That's a chicken. Jeopardy. On your host. Alex. For a beef. We move on now to double jeopardy. Hany, you had the low score at the end of the last round. Choose a category please. Extra terrestrial is for 200. It makes strange noises in the chicken coop late at night. Yes, bonus. Right for do. No. Cajun. No. What is a poultry guy? Poetree guy. Hany and you still have control of the board. To beck or not to beck for 600. He was the star of the Omen. Bonus. Correct. We'll return with my only chicken jeopardy where category we have. Chokee in the pattern. We need to do it. Well 40. Rejecting techniques. Remember to disconnect immediately. Don't give it color time to respond. This is how to blow off the color. Thank you. I'll pass along your comment. Click. Number two. I'm sorry. There's no more time to start. I'll pass your comment along. Click. Three. I'm sorry. We can't use your call today. But we appreciate your interest. Click. Meet tough. But be polite whenever possible. Scratch that last part of that out. Miami. You don't know. I'm really pissed off. How can you call yourself an American if you're not even worried about our space shuttle landing OK on the field? Yes. What is that? I mean, can you really call yourself an American? No. So why? You know, you'd rather talk about guiding light or some stupid bull crap. So pop around TV. And listen to the space shuttle land. Yes. The importance of our space program here in the United States and you're not even worried about our, you know, getting here in good condition. What is that? Right. You know, I'm really surprised. As much support as you can for us to the war. Yeah. But as important as a space program, you don't really don't care. Do you know what I think living proof of our space program is sir? What? This call. 1243 a WIOD. More space at this place. We have an open line in date. 751. Let's go to Davy. Hello. Yeah. I'm off to have to have ready. So you know what the space shuttle landing is to me? The example of the ignorant American public. You know that this waste or money. You can ask a thousand people give them. Give me one example of what we've got out of space shuttle program. It'll be like, I don't know. You know, I don't know. What have we got out of this? It's a waste of money to me. And, you know, I think that's a way to, you know, like, we don't know, we already know what's killing our planet. Nobody does this shit, you know? Well, I've taught 43. How come that isn't done here in the rules? We already know what's killing our planet. Nobody does this shit. You know what's killing our planet. Nobody does this shit. Nobody does this shit. Let's go to a, you're right about the last part, sir. They don't. 524Wild, we have an open line on the center square and Broward on the, Paul Lindline. Miami Beach. Yes, Neil. First time cooler the name is Carmen. And I'm off, I'm all pepped up for a parmen or a carmine. Yeah, it's Carmen. Carmen Miranda? No, no, no. It's Italian. But one on the feast is Saint Carmel. They took the yellow off and added an end. But it's been kind of difficult here in the, in the south of Florida. But I am the father of six children. So there's no problem there. Neil, I have a favorite ask of you. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here. Okay. Have you written on 95 lately going to earth in date counting? Yeah. There's a massive amount of potables. I've run two tires already. I'd like to see you as our night in shining armor to get something done. No chance. This show is not involved in social activism. You're not even a judge. You're just here to entertain on. And one of the questions. I will give you the number that guy that's all concerned about the astronauts. Yes. Okay. This is based good at. And Neil, I was wondering, how come you never, you never mentioned, time you're cruise. I'm not mentioning it. Listen, it's great hearing you want to show. You can't help me and keep up the good works there. Okay. Okay. That one's slip through the screening process badly. Okay. Maybe when we have a little time later on on the show, we can analyze how that particular call. Slip through our intensive exhaustive screening process. Let's make sure we don't happen again. Let's go to Miami on the starline. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. Be very pissed off. Be very busy. No one else be busy. Okay. Boy, they're doing it. They're inhaling the helium this hour. Tell you that. Miami. Did it. Did that guy say there's a bunch of pot on 95. He wanted you to help with? Yeah. Oh. He was smoking it. Listen, I got the Metro bus schedule for Chuck Meyer. If he's interested, when they, you know, the partner, leaving. Well, we're going to be covering every arrivals of matter. And we're going to get the mini bus schedule too. Exactly. I have IOD mini breaks with the mini bus landings. And for George the four little words are on page two of the memory. Got to turn it over. Okay. But wait a minute. You're on hold, weren't you? Yes. I heard it. But it didn't get on the second. You made the cut. Not the second time. No. No. Well, sorry. I wanted to wait back. See you. Once the next take off of the shuttle. You posted the least update. 1252. 1252 will have another. I'll see you. How about a draft show for the shuttle? Good. Good. Good. So draft the action out. Draft the sea later. 1247 a WIOD. We have an open line of date. 75519463751 WIOD for Lauderdale. I'm happy because George told me so. Okay. That's number one. Number two. I don't come from a baseball town. A magic question. When you buy a season ticket they give you a break. Of course. Well, because you know football, these are 28 months, when you go to the 16. Well, that's because there's only a limited number of games. They got to give you a break in baseball. Probably not much. You all can't protect it. They give you a. No. You don't know. Minimal. Minimal. We're going to do it anyway. I think. You're right. All right. We'll be there. You got it. See you. You got it. Here's a mobile and pop-in-o. Hello. Yeah, I mean, yeah. Yeah. That's up in the screen, man. That's pretty good. Good stuff. Hey, did you happen to catch that locker room interview after that basketball game the other night with your little buddy, Costa? No. That was the most incredible thing I've ever ever. You mean, one where he said about Michael Jordan's mother and father and it was his wife? Yeah. Yeah. I couldn't believe it. I could have me. He looked like a durable for Christ's sake. Yeah, guys. He's like four and a half feet tall, rock around the locker room. And he does. And he does have his nose up all the super-jocks but. So I guess the kind of food. No, no problem. His little is he is running around. Stickin' his nose. Everybody's business. But I couldn't believe that when he said, you know, here's Michael Jordan sitting with his mother. And Michael says, that's my wife. And he looks at her. And she says, oh, it must be the hat. I mean, let's install the bitch twice. Yeah, right. But it's believable. I could have believed it. The craziest thing I was all. But anyway, I'm pulling up in front of the grandstand right now. Going into a little bit of betting on the corners tonight. And I didn't know what you cut that thing. And I just thought I'd give you a yellow. Say hi. We caught it. All right. Good luck to you, sir. You'll need it. Yeah. There comes the bunny. Well, listen, we got no put light and browned. Five, two, four, W, Y, would be. There just you a lot of ridiculous personal questions. It gets your name in a phone number. You'll always probably have some problems at home. It's 107. Let's go to the Starlight and Dearfield. Neil. Yeah. Yeah. That's for some color. Great. Where's the asterisk? Oh, there it is. Yeah. That doesn't know what that means. He said I should be happy, you know? There's only one asterisk. This one? Yeah. Everybody's got one. That's the only wonder. Wonder. But yeah, I was watching the ambition the other night. Effective. Effective Oprah calls put a big asterisk next to her name. Very. There you go. But I was watching the ambition the other night. Now finally figured out who she is. Yeah. She's buddy Ryan and drag. Yeah. That's what I figured about. Ryan's been signed on in the whole time, and it's buddy Ryan and drag. Look real close. You'll see the way. Yeah. He does wear nice sweaters too. How about the name South Florida grades for the team? one way to Wild. No more names. See, that's another thing that should be on this thing screen about. Every caller asks him if they have a name for the team and if they even begin to say, yes, hang up on him. Some days I feel myself. This is on Brookjie in New York, the blistering effects of global warming continues to take their toll around the country in Falco, North Dakota, a screening of the movie backdrop caused the two adjacent movie screens to also catch fire. For obvious reasons, the A15 showing of stone coal was canceled. This is Tom Brookjie, Taco Lossier Hotbox. Once 16, at Wild, did you just a great day isn't it's not raining is it? We don't know. What kind of thing is there anything on there? Nothing. It's great going to be a great night at the ballpark, we're night at the pump at the park, we're night for the Irish. South Beach. Hey, now. Yeah, it's deadly. Deadly? Yeah, deadly from South Beach. From what? South Beach, how you doing? Oh, South Beach. Yeah, it's raining down here. It's raining on South Beach. Yeah. I'll be there, and Billy. Hey, check this out. Yeah. You need to go to Massachusetts, South Beach, man. For what? There's the best pizza down there. You mean an all-in-road? All-in-road. All-teen and all-teen and 17. Yeah, I've been there. No. You gotta go there. They take food stamps too. They save them or they take them. They take them. They steal them? Huh? Well, you got some Billy? No, do you? Yeah, I got a bunch of them. I ripped them off from some old ladies. Hey, let me ask you a question. See a Billy? Why don't so many people talk to me? Say, too. Like who? Oh, no, it's time to answer my calls. Paul, you're cursing you out. Because they have no taste, Billy. Oh, yeah. There are a bunch of slime balls. All right, Billy. Yeah. Say goodbye. All right. 117 at WIO, deobviously well-screened caller. We have an open line in dates. I got a good idea. Since we usually try to break all the rules that they set down and these things immediately, I see the problems that got all these damn lines. Let up. Do I have these people? Well, let's try four. Hello. Yeah. I hope my father say you're right. Let's go to four-laradale. Hello. Okay. Okay. This will work out. We're going to dump all these calls. Okay. Sorry. I apologize. We had all lines that I don't want to do that. Well, I'm sorry. I want to try to break through. Well, not says. What was the one sheet? It said, um, call us under eight. No, no, get out.
