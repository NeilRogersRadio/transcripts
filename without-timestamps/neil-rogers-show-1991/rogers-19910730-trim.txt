Boca on the award line. Hello. Neil. Yes. In honor of P.E. Bring back the lightning round. Yeah. Bring back this, sir. We need the license, OK? What open line it, Broward? Two of them. 524Wild. Maybe that the cloud cover is covering up and Broward again. Maybe they can't hear us. Or maybe Greg's talking about how depressed he is in Sioux, Sidel, or wants to quit and Steve hates him like poison and everybody in Broward's list. I don't know. Hey kids. If you thought P.E.E was fun. Turn in this Saturday morning for Arnie's Playhouse. Drop your eyes, get out of bed. Bang bang bang bang the big ice in its time. Not Arnie's Playhouse.

Two lines open and brown. Five, two, four. And that we were all filled up there for a second or two. But that don't last long. They're just to not with us anymore. See, they hate rick and suds. And they hate me too. But they don't have the gumption to call in here and say that. Because they're not listening anymore. 1,800, 9,44, Wiod, our toll free Florida line. Miami. Meal. Yes sir. Listen, maybe you can tell me if this room was true. Yeah. That was a shrubin is going to serve soda to get them off. No, I don't want to get into Ellis personal life.

No, it's going to be something gross. Oh, no, no, no. Everybody's in musician today. Everybody's a comedian. This is one of show starts taking a turn for the Worsh. Oh, no, it's not gross. Okay. You sure? Yeah. I know. Okay. That's it. That's it. I like you watch movies. Every time I see you, I feel like baby, baby, baby, baby. Hey, I see you. Hi. Great job. Oh. Hello. Thank you. I'm your friend. Welcome. Hey, hello. How are you, how are you? Thank you. How are you? That's good. I'm fine. Hi. I'm fine. You're fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine. Thank you. I'm fine. I'm fine. It's fine. I know you apologize for what happened yesterday. Well, you hung up on me. I called back and the guy answers and said I said the slang word for... You didn't say any slang word. You said a disgusting four letter, grow test war that begins with S&Ns with T. Uh-huh, right, right. So would you accept my apology? No. This is a radio show. This is a kind of a pornographic, uh, pay-ways, p-house or something. I didn't know that. But, uh, how you're married, you have to be a little more careful when you're on the radio, because we live in a fascist world where everybody's so concerned about words, okay? Yeah, I know. I will. I've listened to you about a handful of times, and I've heard of them. Don't worry about a handful, too. That's so very serious, soda. Or a half a handful. Well, that means just it's pathetic. It's tragic. It's embarrassing. And I wasn't pretending to be fascist. We only think of repressive country and everybody's so stupid. They're too busy worried about what the William Kennedy Smith trial to take time out to worry about these things. Oh, I know. What does it start? I don't know. But I recently was- And also all of you who don't have a satellite dish. Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. Because it's going to be on court TV, and none of your cable companies are giving you court TV, and it's got forsaken state yet. And only those of us with satellite dishes can watch it on F312 every day, every minute of the juicy trial. We ought to charge admission for people to come watch it. We ought to rent out the Jorabi state. Am I better? I could pack that baby. Ten bucks ahead? So anyway, what are you saying? Oh, well, I originally called you about the lobster season yesterday. Oh, this is not the microny ratio. I'm not interested in lobster, so that's what you're interested in. Not interested in fishing or golf or lobster's. What about beefball? What about it? Well, you told the game that they eat the ball and they miss them. You're- Have an open line and a bowered by the way 524Wild. What is it? Hold on a second. Yep, it's working. I'm just checking. Okay. Well, you're team one by the guy missing the ball. I'm not into baseball, but I know you are. Well, last year, I don't know what the opposing team was, but the Dawson's won a game like that. They're opposing team kick. Yeah. Well, you don't want to go back to last year. What does that mean? Oh, nothing. I had a thrill over it. That it was pretty hard to handle. You know, the thrilling game that they won by them missing the last field, Daw. Is they missed? We- Is that have to do with dropping a fly ball? I don't know. I heard something on your show yesterday about the winning, you know, the guy posting the baseball game. Posting the baseball game. Oh, whatever. I think your sports knowledge, man, is full of- Right. You're right. Like what you said yesterday? Exactly. Right. Well, hey, I told my husband- The comedy version was anyway. I wanted to call you up when nobody was lighting up your lines, yes. Yeah. But I got a break that was. Yeah. I get home and wait on the line for an hour. We had a great conversation. You wait on the line? Yeah. And then you got the news going. And then I get, you know, shut off because of the- The- In a word. In a- The- In a word? Hey. I-I got recommended by my brother-in-law by saying that word. To a little kid by accident. And I just got that. I got recommended by your brother. Do you have any idea what you're talking about or you just do- Do you do ask it like every morning at about 10? No. I have two children. I'm lucky there be a way. Do you have two children? Yes. Get a child rest on the phone, George, and trace this call immediately. Okay. Well. Have a great day. You too. See you. Don't ever, ever darken this phone again. Hey, Billy. Blow my finger. Tonight on ABC, it's America's most heavily armed singing sensation. The cartridge family. I'm sleeping. There's a prowler in my bedroom. So I'll spring up in my bed and I'll pump him full of land. I think I'll shoot you. No. Seven day waiting period for this family. Is your late-yes, Rubin? I've decided to up my feed to 20%. It comes as I give it 10 will be fine. Then with Danny Falls for a rather much-ill looking woman, it's LA Law Susan Day to the rescue. Here's off my brother. You A.C. D.C. Miss Fettler. Thank you. Like a prox, you'll love the cartridge family. It's domestic violence and it's musical-fast. The champion of all the zombies, the Swiss. We're a bigger happy. We're a bigger happy. The cartridge family tonight on ABC, following the final episode of The Brady Boo. 1126, a good old W.I.O.D. where we unveil our big new sign out there, man. I bet you there'd be like millions of people just flocking by crowding the cause way to see that on Friday. This Sunday night, it's history's funniest home video. We have a classic clip on the Lincoln family that they call getting ready. How do you have a baby? We'll be late for the theater. So we're late. What are they going to do? Shoot me. Watch as your skateboard is Harry Houdini runs into a little trouble in home. Harry, turn it down. We're right there. Harry, it's always stuff. I'm not there. And we'll go all the way back to the Revolutionary War to check out this hilarious video set in by a Mr. Patrick Henry. Give me liberty. Give me death. Give me death. Give me liberty. Give me death. Yes, it's history's funniest home videos. Sunday night, it's 830. Catch it now. Before it's history. Hello. Hi. Yes, are we having a problem on the phone today? No. Can you hear me? Just barely. You can barely hear me? Just barely. Now you're here full of it. Come on. Okay, listen. I have a question. A couple days ago, you are on the air. And somebody started talking about these two books. And I don't remember which one. Well, I'm always called the plumber. And the other one was called something else. You're on the electrician. No. Send the, you see, do you want to listen? Sorry. Send of the father. Send to the father. Yeah. I meant to write it down. I was remembering and I'm striped home. And I got him on the spot. Which one was better? I didn't read the plumber. No. I had lunch with Gordon Litty, but I had not read the plumber. Are you going to waste your time and read it? Yeah. Really? I can find it. Huh. And everything was on this pee we stuff? Yeah. The show's not that good. Anyway, it's no great loss. Really? pee we? pee we's play house. I'm afraid I don't catch it. It's not a good, I'd babysit for my neighbors kids. It's not a good show anyway. So who cares? It's a good show. It's a good show. Well, it's something for people to get all excited about, okay? I guess so. And you suppose it would have been Dan rather than we really figured it out into it. And if it would have been Dan rather dressed up as pee we then we really could have been. Would that have been great? Great. Oh, that was it. Well, that believed me. Read them both. Read them both. Kill a lot of good time for you. Do you have no other words, you? No. No. Some wise guy who smarter than we are all calling. Have a great day. You did. Cool springs. I knew I had done. Great. Listen, I just got back in California. I was in San Francisco. Yes. And I had a video accident. I turned on and there was Alex Demont on the team. On the tube? What an ugly. Oh, what? Yes, ugly. Okay. And he had a radio. What did you say the first time in ugly? Ugly soccer. Oh, soccer. Okay. Well, my ears are plugged up. Okay. Now you're trying to take advantage of me. I don't know why I asked you to repeat it. It would have only made it worse, but could have been interesting. He had an audience. Yeah. Well, at least he's got an audience. So kids more than I can say. Well, I only got a bunch of deadheads out there. Oh, boy. We'll love you. She'll love it. Yeah, a bunch of spastices. What we got. Some pastiques. Listen, a couple things. I've lost them. I'm quick on P. We. I just want to know one thing. We lay off a P. We already for crying out loud. She's lay off the P. We. I just want to know how many crimes were committed while there's police and we're in that theater. There were probably rapes and murders and arson's and drug deals probably within a 30 foot radius of where they were up. Picking people. I know you're being, I mean, I'm not. I'm serious. No, I'm not. You are too. And it's, I'm dead serious. But nobody cares because in this country. We have a bunch of hypocrites and everybody's worried about who's touching below the waste. It's all the biggest bunch of crap I've ever heard in my life. It really, really. One of they just leave everybody alone for crying out loud. And I got to tell you, I've never seen it. We've got to touch yourself, police and the sidewalk police and across the street police. And, oh, yesterday I'm driving the store on sunrise in plantation. And there's the most pathetic motorcycle pig sitting on a corner of Navajo and sunrise under a palm tree waiting for somebody to do something naughty and not nice. I mean, just a pile of crap. Just sitting there with a surly redneck look on his face. Game a break. Well, you go do something constructive. Go sit with Peel your skin. Get out of here. We broke down Sunday night on the turnpike. And luckily, I had a mobile phone. Yeah. But I got to tell you, we were there in an hour and I won't leave from came far. I could tell you how high my blood sugar is right now sir. You would probably have a stroke right on the phone just from hearing the number. My head is swimming. I feel like Marlene a Dietrich on a bad day. Well, I got that problem. I feel like Mark Spitz. Yeah, give me some of that coke that'll do it. Give me a little sugar. That'll do it, George. Well, why do they do this to me? Why don't they stop? I'm telling you before 2 o'clock. I will find out the name of the person responsible for bringing that slime ball back you with the food and sicken him on me with that crap that I don't want. I've screamed I've yelled I've hollered. I don't want it. I can't eat it. I've been sick. The stress the food and they just keep insisting. I'm going to sue this place. I really am. I'm getting a good crooked lawyer and I'm going to sue the pants off of them. For food malpractice. Listen, one other thing. Soon as they pay me off. Yeah. How come when you go to a movie theater? And you sit behind or in front of these older people? I don't know what it is, but it's moving. Yeah. It's like you would swear this. I've never seen a front of older people. I said to be in front of young people. Okay. Because I'm going to peek back there. They're in the movie with you and then they're together. And they don't know what it is, but it's moving. And then of course you got to find out what it is. What is it now? Why is it the older people they're together? Okay. But they keep describing the movie to each other as if the other ones not. Because they don't care about anybody else. Don't you understand that, sonny? It's their time. Don't bother them that they only ones there's like on the road. The same thing. Get out of their way. It's their time. Look at that. Look at that. I'm watching MTV now. So you have to excuse me. I'm just being a pervert on the radio. And I enjoy every second of it. Okay. And if it offends anybody up your is okay. I'm tired of all you phony's out there with your closet lives. You make me sick. Right? Sir? Sir? Yeah. Yeah. I'm not listening anything. I'm saying. This is an conversation. This is like, I don't know what it is. Listen, I take look at troll. Do you take anything? I take look at troll also, sir. Okay. But unfortunately, when you haven't taken any and I'm not, I should need before noon any how. Do you understand? Yeah. And I've been having a problem and it took me four days to get my sugar down to where it ought to be. This morning, not too bad at level. I felt great. It felt sensational. You know how it is when your blood sugar gets real high. Yeah. And you feel like you're dying over there. And that's, and then the guy brings the food. They bring him back here. Oh, here's some goofball got a bunch of food. This guy could be like an axe murderer. I know. And he just wandered back here. I'm telling you, this place, if they never get their act together and hear and stop worrying about how much show the building is. If they'd ever, you know, run a real radio station. This could be a fun place to be. It really could have once upon a time it was for a couple of days. I can't remember when. And it's tough because. God. What is wrong with them? They got like 8,000 people here and nobody takes any responsibility. It's like they're all just shuffling around in the hallway. Like, where, what's going on? Where are we going? And what's, you know, like they're lost. Like the land of the lost. Why doesn't somebody assert himself or itself in this place? And say, no, we don't just open up those adrapes by the way, George. There's a lot of commotion out there in the hallway. I think we're going to find out who brought that asshole back here. Well, you have a great day, sir. And what? Did you bring that person back here? Stephanie and Gwen? No, they did not do it. But they did eat some of the food. Well, I'm not blaming him for that. Have a great day, sir. An open line at Broward. 5, 2, 4, pissed. I am. I'm just smoking. The smoke has come out of my ears. This is Combrochia, I knew it. President Bush has pulled a surprise news conference. We suspect that he may have changed his mind on the Supreme Court nominee. We now join that news conference already in progress. I'm mind about the previous nominee. So instead, I've decided to nominate three women to the Supreme Court. Right girls, you mean it's a free score? Hey, this court for white and out. He's left it to the white and out. Everybody's hanging out. Let's name the hero. Now we're getting down. And you can't turn it off. No, you just have to wait. We're too busy singing. There's no time to measure strength. We're right down in the Senate. Now we're in the black steps and the things. Probably not. Let it lay. It's me. Look real good. Now we may come on. That's your turn. You have flat. Yeah. Well, Diana, I've got the things that they've been beat with. Don't you give me. I just give you some of the things. How did you add to the band? No, you went down right back. This is our ball job. I'll soon be. Another IOD emergency staff meeting ladies and gentlemen to address the serious problem of these Mel contents, these miscreants, these sliballs that muscle their way to the building, mysteriously with arm loads, butt loads and truck loads of food. WOD, dear field. It's the wonderful day in the name of the good. Can you say master bait? Sure you can. How's it going Neil? I am Tonya. Man, the whole world is so riled up by this. It's just incredible. Isn't it wild? I think it's about time for somebody to take this into hand and get a hold of it. That's right. You fork it. That's going to be cool. You know, thanks for your show today. I've released a lot of stress from me. I know. I'm sure that's great. The meantime, I'm going to have another stroke here on the air. People are taking up office pools right now all over town to see what time it happens. Yeah. Well, anyway, Neil, you're the greatest. That's a good one. See ya. And offer the circuit. Open line and Broward. 524WIOD. My head is swimming. I feel like a good tune in early. On a way across the English channel as in what channel are you on? Hey, open line and Broward. 524WIOD. Let's get some women on this phone. Let's get some living and breathing people. WIOD. Hi. You don't sound like a woman? I'm a must-be-see. Would you like to dress up like one? I do occasionally. Okay. Listen, I want to change in beer with people. I don't think beer will be a pee-we would say. Oh, even more pee-we would do real. More pee-we would do real. Look, guys in there, whacking it. What do you leave them alone? What's this about pee-we? Oh, this is about one of them. No, but I mean, what is it about? What do you want to remind me of? It's like the thing I touched myself. It's like the song. Like these little punky kids that are listening to Power Night. They just invented that. You know, they just discovered it. Wait a minute. It's a long time ago. Kids, okay? I didn't have to sing a song about it. I think even though the crack addicts are running rampant and throwing elephant turns through the windows in waterdale. Yes? Janking people's arteries and chains from their necks. Yes? I think it's just great to nicknivore. Took the time to go in and bust that lady for having sex her own bedroom. I want you to buy me. Yeah. And I think if he gets Rick Sanchez for his press agent, he could probably make the next Supreme Court nomination. Yes, sir. Good stop, opaque. Right. You got it, pal. Heinrich Himmler lives. I hope these people wake up before they are going to wake up on morning and realize that when they get that news Supreme Court just as confirmed, I'd be right wing. That'll really cap it all off. I don't think they could get any further than the right. They're going to make a round circuit. Right. The right one. Look, those around comes around. You got it. Keep your pass beforehand. I'm going to try. See you. And your trench coat. 1242 at WIOD. That's our motto for this week. Keep your passport in one hand and your trench coat in the other. Can't get in too much trouble that way. It's the Pillsbury Du Bois. He looks more like the Pillsbury Du Bois. Yeah. I'll say that. Poppin' steel. What a day. Do you want to start at one? Oh, man. You got a lot of cars. Yeah, one AM. How come they're giving the time on the channel for news now at five o'clock? And it'll do this. It's five minutes after eight. It was actually five o'clock. But he can't read the clock to well. Really? Why are they giving the time? Yeah, I can't see that. Just another chance to screw up. Well, let's not a people call it in rip you to your face. All right. You're back. Yeah. Rip and behind the back. Really? And so what if you are divorced? I mean, I exactly. I don't understand what the first of all. It's nice to see. Nobody can do it. Nobody's damn business number one. Secondly, most of you idiots. If you're not divorced, you're not divorced. Now you will be by the end of the week. And what's the big deal about it? Like it's somebody's business out there. And all of a sudden, you used to be an ice guy. Right. You know, you got a divorce? Yeah. Fifteen. Oh, man. Next thing, you'll be walking around with a trench coat. Fort Lauderdale. Neo. Yeah. How you doing, buddy? I'll loan it to you. Good. I won't think about the big deal. Or we turn to the blue Laguna's coming any day in a theater near you. What? Neil. Awesome hats. Thank you so much. I thought that was food for just a second. Oh, sir. I want to tell you, you almost just were part of a radio accident. Wow. The young lady from Florida just came by and she had a bag. Yeah. And I thought there was more food in it. And I was just about ready to have a cardiac arrest. We were going to make a cardiac arrest. I want to get off the TV home instead of a turn minute. What? I want to get off TV home in a turn minute. Who is on him? Oh, these are floorless pizza heads. What does that mean? Okay. Go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. We're very confused. People in South Florida suck. Yes, we know that. And last week, this my first time, I'll be able to call some class week. Some guys. Yeah. Some guy called up and he was a bitch and already about to have for the Miami Marlin. And they weren't even out yet. I know. You just have looking for some of the bits about it. I know it. And the amazing thing to me, the one legitimate gripe they've got all through the years. I hear all these belly aches about the stadium and the parking. The one legitimate gripe that they have, which we talked about the other day about the price for the exhibition games being ridiculous. And you would think that we were communists. Now, because we said that. I mean, that's a little bit right. No. It's a beautiful stadium. We got a great team and the support all of this. But for a crappy exhibition game, those prices are ridiculous. And we have the audacity to say that. Now we're bad guys. Okay. I don't understand the time of guys because we're oh yeah. Are you serious? Do you boy? I went on and on. I'm don't boy. I know. I did too. It's ridiculous. What it is. And people are just looking for it. I'm behind the dolphins as much as anybody. But right now you got to, you know, call it as it is. He don't care about the dolphins. Who? You. I love my dolphins. I love my dolphins. Cheerleaders. Well. That's part of the packet. Yeah. Let's get to the meat of the man. I don't have to crap. All right. They're all divorced. Relatively speaking. How? He wouldn't know Dan Moreno from Marinara sauce. Go ahead. How does make a good marinara sauce? Yeah. He doesn't care. Yeah. Now, what's he changes lipstone? Sure. Call her on the line. Yeah. That Joker look with those lips has got to go Danny. What is it, sir? Relatively speaking. How quick will the marlins be? Will they improve faster than heat? Well, being a new prey to that. He probably is. Yeah. Oh, definitely. Good. Definitely. Because it's a different whole different ball game. You know, baseball is different at basketball. They'll be competitive within your lifetime. Not mine. Yeah. Good. Thanks for the call. Yeah. Okay. We'll call you again. Neil. You're a great American. I know. See you. Okay. He's doing all of my lines. Boy. Boy. I see. I got all screwed up right off the bat this morning. Because it's Tuesday.

Save your money honey. Oh, trust me. What a let down. Yeah. I mean, I thought I was so excited when I saw it the other day. You know, so I said, oh, I gotta go get what? Don't do it. Forget it. You'll be a bin for a small disappointment. Oh, well, I don't save my money to eat them. Okay. Thank you, Neil. Have a nice day. Bye. 146 at Wiod the end is in sight. We can see blight at the end of the tunnel. 751 Wiod at open line and date and one in Broward rhymes with coward. 524 9463. Let's pom beach. I know. How you doing? How you doing? I'm going to tell you where I'm from. What is it? I'm at the time of the story. You're ready? Yeah. You know, it's about the folks that are cemetery village. Hello. I'm here. I'm at least an answer. I'm listening. Okay. You know, once a week, the organ on the bus and they go do their shopping. Uh-huh. The public for windings or wherever it is. Yeah. On a recent trip. They all have gone in and done their shopping. They're about. They all got on the bus ready to go. Yeah. And the manager steps aboard the bus and says, okay. So, one of them plays a summoning the bus steal from food. So, I'm not going to embarrass everyone. And I want that person when you get back to just leave it on the seat. And we're not going to call the police on anything. You know how many times I've heard this story, sir? Is that good? About they all got up and got off the bus and every seat there was stuff left behind. I'm not the filthy shopping basket. Right. That's great. A tisket of task is leaving it in my basket. Okay, but you haven't heard this one. Okay. As TV was being right out in handcuffs. Okay. One fifty two a WIOD boy. They got that beat scene on MTV again right now. And I don't have time to be bothered with this thing and show. Okay. Look at those. This is the one that I was watching yesterday about the same time. No. Different cast of characters. Not bad. Anyway, let's go to Miami Beach. Hello. Are you doing? Okay. A bunch is more entertaining than a race. Yeah. That's good. Okay. Box this. Hi Johnny. Have a nice day over the coast. Pepper fine. Hello. What's up Neil. How are you? Great. I want to talk to you about Las Vegas. Yeah. I lived up there for two years and I tell you, I always hear you say what a great time. It is. I hated it out there. Why is that? Nothing to do. I mean, it's a drinking gamble. You gamble out there. Are you going to blow up? Or you get out of here. Nothing to do. But drinking gamble. Go away. What? What else besides that? I was there for two. I made great money. I was a fortune throughout there. Yeah. But I made great money. But I don't drink. Okay. So there must be something else to do out there beside drink. Well, you told me one thing since you've been out there so many times. Tell me one of the sites. Go about the big name entertainment. How about the shows? How about the food? What? I mean, if you live out there, how often can you go? You know, those tickets are tickets. I'll go. But you don't understand. The point is that at least you have the option. When you live somewhere, you have a series of options. People live in New York City. They don't go to a Broadway show every day of the week. But once in a while, when there's something they want to see, it's there and they go in a short. I don't understand it. But at least out here, I mean, at least you don't want to tell where you can do. You can do the football thing. We've got baseball. We've got basketball. I mean, there's no sports out there. I mean, no sports out there at all. They're all on the big screen and the sports. But I'm going to see whatever they have you want. But that's not the same thing as watching on the bigger. Yes, sure. So your life is more than just a ball game. Okay. It will be great when we have baseball, because baseball is just about every night in the summertime. That's great. We're just the good stuff out there. We've got lots of deserts right now. Well, you're the only person I have ever spoken to in my life who gave me the song. I'm talking about, I'm talking about people who lived there. I'm not talking about people who visited there. No, I can't understand it. I mean, it's a hot... In addition to which this is supposed to be a tourist town. Okay. That's not what it's all about. It's having things for people to do. What do you think you guys, you could eat the people go out there and retire and gamble. I mean, the end up spending the living in the alley. Oh, sir. Go have a go have a Hershey animal. Will you get out of my life? They go and spend every nickel. I'm talking about tourist places, places for people to go places and do things. Dumbbell, no wonder you're here. God, almighty. If you didn't like it there, I'm happy for you, okay? North Miami Beach. Yes, sir. Me cohere on this jungle, underway. Only in English, okay, on the show. Only in English. Let's try Miami on the storyline. Hello. Mr. Rogers, watch your bullet pressure there. I know. These people are nuts today. I think from Vegas, that man is the biggest dip spit I have ever spoken to in my life. Anyway, there's nothing to do there. Yeah, that's exciting here. We're going to sit around and wait for the Marlins for year and a half. Okay, it'll be great when the meantime. I had to go live at the morning or someplace like that. Oh, God. Anyway, I spoke to you earlier this year. I'm not one of your scum-sucking fan wagons, jumping cubs fans. I'm a doctor fan. I like to thank your cubs for beating up on the braze. It was an exciting series. Yeah. I'll try to help you out tonight, but you guys are going to have to get some hits. You know, you have three hits and two games. We're hitting the job. We're hitting our way out of a paper bag. It's a hit. We almost got no hit three times in the past six days. But keep it up and it's good luck. And I'd like to see you guys beat up on the rest. Quite the other guy. Well, we're going to try it. Thank you, sir. We're going to take our bats. I'll tell you that. All right. See you. Not necessarily for the game. 156 at WIOD Miami. Rick and son starts. Okay. Thanks. Miramar. Yeah. You haven't gotten my head over blockbuster and I love it. Go Marlin, Dennis and Joe. You're major douchebags. Okay. Good job. Right to the point. He got it all in. He touched all the bases and how to do you. Miami Beach on the Starline. Hello. Yes, sir. Neil. Yeah. You got a minute to talk. Sometimes I'm off the air. About a day fundraiser for a canal south. What do you mean about a fund? Raise your for a canal south. I was introduced to something last night that would be, I think, very interesting to you and to me, I was to raise money for a canal south. We regard to what? Doing what? Racing money. But I mean, what is it? Well, maybe you could tidy with your, uh, into the year. If I need you always to, uh, to raise money. Okay. Hold on a second. Sure. Why did these people call me on the air with stuff? Why don't they talk to me if that? Why do they talk to boy Kurt? I think I'm losing it. North Miami. Whatever happened to Ron St. John's junior. Good question. And then he couldn't have had a big smash hit in 1945. Yeah. Call it got to be this or that he actually sang on the record. Wow. And novelty vocal by the man himself. Okay. Call up Stugolts. They'll be right over to compare notes with you. Well, that's going to do it for us. And none too soon. Let me tell you that boys and girls carry your trench coats. Even on a sunny day. That's the message we learned today. Rick and puddle. I'm sorry. Duboy and puddle. Be a long after the two o'clock news for four exciting hours. Joseph Gackie and Sunny Hershey will be here on Sports Talk to do their usual two day evening.
