What's you know that in itself is no big deal There's not much there. It's okay a lot of shforkers in there now. Oh speaking that Yeah, they destroyed a lot of neighborhood in that city too. You'll be pleased to know our pull on Saturday or over the weekend at least got a tremendous response A tumultor a 1643 votes around it as I speak now. That's one of our highest ever Some non alien polls. I mean the alien polls. They had like 20 trillion votes, but that was a different story different that was something important wasn't it low now Which group of people to destroy neighborhood the fastest was a poor question Friday and over the weekend you ponded that and you're molded over You talked it over with your friends you took surveys among your peer group and they said Africa and Americans 810 49.2% said Africa and Americans destroy neighborhood Fast you and anybody on the face of the earth basically Rednecks or white trash or trailer trash whatever code words you like to use 2203 they came in a distant second 13 and a half percent Haitians followed with 142 8.6% Cubans with 132 and of course George wants to make sure you understand worldie talking about toothless dark skin humans 8% orthodox Jews well actually you said you didn't say the toothless, but I put that into the protect you Orthodox Jews 100 6% Oh Puerto Rican 75 I guess they didn't see that piece on central park That was on a game yesterday on MSNBC You know must be the MS Puerto Rican 75 or 1.5% to make in 63 month you point 8% You guys yes 39 2.3% Mexican 38 2.3% Nikoragwood's 22 1.3% I'll be forget to accept it about Nikoragwood's wonderful people there And how great they are to sell your house to the best of the neighborhood You know I'm thinking of myself probably the reason that Karadwood's did so well is because do you know any Nikoragwood No, do you know any Nikoragwood? No George's chicken is said feverously no the girl does he really want Miguel is the one remember his roommate Or he's got an Ecaragron roommate from Fomosa Yeah He's always had going around singing hang-down your head But anyway Tom do we so I know and I guess that's the reason that most of us can't really pass a reasonable opinion about Nikoragwood Because most people don't live or maybe it happens to be that they're wonderful neighborhoods And they're very have great ethics and standards and they keep the place clean and they don't think of the joy And don't throw all our garbage out on the goddamn sidewalks and don't destroy the property values in the hood etc. Maybe that's possible So let's give a better food without to our Nikoragwood friend Some of them have a bad complex as we know 22 only 1.3% Yeah Some of them maybe kind of what distant kind of wan Well it's picking a sunny Rosenberg You're right No but politically See I got to mention his name here today because he's obviously out there squeezing his bag right now And on the same petty day there's gonna be something else to do that grizzled old fart Your dead sonny you're as good as dead your finito you're done baby They said get out of here you silly old person you go away Take your goddamn outhouse gang with you So done by not does me anything anybody else out there That's okay So I might I'll just suffer along.

What is it called? It's called headlines And headlines and headlines and something Yeah Headline doesn't celebrate He's over The thing about the Brady Bunch They must have shown that piece for a thousand times And I didn't even like that show I didn't even watch the guy named Brady Bunch But Robert Reed What about Robert Reed? I'm sorry I'm just a little bit scared I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm just kidding I'm just kidding And I'm just kidding Yeah From the Brady freakin Bunch We go way further back And Robert Reed Everybody grew up on the Muppets and Sesame Street Everybody grew up on the Muppets Maybe that's why they look like that Here's Alan Who says I agree with George Which he corrected his spelling and actually spelled it right? Phil Harmon was one of the most talented actors of the 80s 90s Perhaps longer If you don't want Jesus calling you to your show Why do you insist on keeping them on your list? No hard feelings He's just trying to win the front of the you team Love the show Alan Well first of all I did put Phil Harmon on list tonight Yes And number two I mean And the G-Jesus Frank Sinophthors only for G- And I don't like him Don't get me wrong I wouldn't vote for him I couldn't think of as a paper sack But we're talking about people who died like let's say in the last 40-50 years Right? Okay Do you have to be a G-Jesus like Frank Sinophthors That bad taste And how about Elvis? How about Elvis? It helps No but how about Elvis? What anybody did hit that? I'm catering to G-Jesus by putting Elvis on list No just thought And how about John Lennon? People who use it was 60s music 60s and 70s John Wayne John Wayne died after John Lennon died He died after John Kennedy died He died after Martin Luther Kool died But he died died But he died the point How about Robert Ried?

Here's a call from Tallahassee, hello. Hey Neil. Yes sir. A couple of names. John Boulouche. Jessica Savage. Jessica Savage. No. Got the whole drug thing there. No. John Boulouche. I mean, you're going to put a still hardman on there. How about John Boulouche? Uh huh. Well, there you go. Okay. John Boulouche. And Bob Lacher's career. How about that? That's not a bad idea. Okay. Anyway, we're off with the tiger stuck to there. Good list. John Boulouche. Okay. See, now you started with a fulfillment thing that I'm going to have, but how about you, the redner? How about her? She's dead. Yeah. Tradget, sad. Yeah. Yeah. I wanted to write. Funny. Funnyer than John Boulouche. To me, different stuff. The thing you have to lose. He was funny. It was always the same thing. She was very funny. And then I was always the same dude. Don't hit it over. Why do you have to? Don't apologize. Don't apologize. The guy's busy him now as opposed to where Roseanne Roseanna Dana, which we have right here in town. Yeah. But he wouldn't get a lot of votes. No, she would not. He get Dean Waters vote. That's about it. See, the idea that Steve Allen has compared to Phil Hartman. It's ludicrous. I saw those old clips. There were, whatever. I guess it's dated. Must have been funny at the time. Steve Allen's stuff. Steve Allen's stuff. Steve Allen's stuff. Steve Allen's stuff. Steve Allen's stuff. That stuff back then was the best television in history. And speaking of television, you see this thing about Tvo last night on No 60 minutes? No. You didn't? No. Oh, you were really good in that. And the heads of the networks are just crap at in their pants now because Tvo and I forget what the other one is called. You know, where you had the little box on the TV set. With the hard drive inside. And it records all the shows you want, whatever you want them to. Right. And the it can edit out the commercials. And you can also, if you're watching the show live, you can pause it and go take a phone call for 10 minutes and come back and pick it up wherever you left off and see the rest of it without rewinding or fast forward Tvo. And so now the networks are frantically trying to figure out how the how they're going to sell commercial time and most people are once they get those which they will when they admit that. They're going to be like dancing to the commercials and not watching them. Oh, yeah. Puba Booth. Tvo. Let's see John Boulouche. Default. A Dvo. 560. 560. 560 on the AT&T line. Mobile and Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Yes sir. How about Charles Schultz? That's a good one. I think he's affected us more than any. I think he affected us more than John Boulouche. Definitely more than John Boulouche. Yeah. Good one. Thank you. Yep. You got it. I agree with him. Charles Schultz. Huh? Sure. He was still working. We're not asking what he's still working. I did that lunch. Hey, I didn't pay. It's still working. He didn't work it over here. The question is, Jackie, it's still working. Exactly. What? Your question is, what? Which public figures death affected you the most? We have four. We have people listening now. I would say from 15 to 80. If they were not going to be new anymore, their death would have a less. How about Henry Ford? How about Charles? Isn't he? He made a new anymore. If they were done making whatever it was that was the... How about Wayne Boulouche? Who cares? He's still holding it. You don't see what I'm saying. If their career was already years over, what difference does their death make? They're not doing what they were doing. They're still working. They're still working. They're not doing what they were doing. They're still working. They're still working. They're still working. They're still working when they died. That's not the point. Charles Schurtz wasn't really still working. He was like, when all this was fired. Like, food ridden to an old fat. How do you like that? That's good ridden to fat or bad rubbish with bad tacky outfits and things. And they guess it would be right. And you have a point. How about another double-seasoned reveal that's come on. Come on. People can get monoclas, marry, or lawns, and Elvis to come over for once today. And we can feed them all those home entice. Thanks again to our good friends, which I threw the cards away by getting them up. And their intentions were very good, but I'm just not doing that anymore. And nobody, not one person in the audience will, maybe one. But nobody else believes me. You'll see. I got the inspiration now, baby. No more fat for this kid. What's the point? We play TV was that other product. We play TV and Tvo. Those are the two brands that they are available now. I mean, you can go out of them. They said they're like between 400 and 800 bucks. And the only knock on them, the one guy said it takes like six hours to install it. Especially if you have like satellite dishes in the whole, but even if you have a satellite dish like 20 or 30 of them like I do, and a cable and all the other, you can still hook it through there. And it downloads the schedules. Downloads all the information from the sky from the satellites. And so you can let's say you wanted to watch, you know, nothing but wrestling shows. You wanted to take them on your hard drive. And you could like punch up wrestling by, you know, category. And they'll show you all the wrestling shows that around that day, that week, whatever. And you can tape them for that day or for the whole next month or whatever. Whatever you want. Or just pick up the ones you want to tape. Can't wait because I'm like touching around with the VCR. This is a hard drive. Exactly. And so the commercials baby, it's going to be just a matter of time before that. And they're talking about, well, you see like some of the shows, like whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, whatever, when they picked out. And in the background in the hospital, there was like a soda machine, a generic one. And they said, well, you know, one month it could be a coke machine or a Pepsi wants to out. Better, it could be a Pepsi machine. They do it movies all the time. Maybe that's how the sponsors are going to have to get in there some livable pitch. Because people are going to be avoiding commercials on television like the plague. Here's a mobile and Hollywood. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. This is live two for you. Okay. One is Brian Jones. Brian Jones. I'm Jones. Rolling Stones. Yeah. Okay. Well, I guess, I'm popular. Okay. And I don't believe no one's mentioned steeper queen yet. Steve McQuestee the Queen. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Okay. We put those on the list. No. Brian Jones. Steve McQueen. How about some other Queen? How about Paul Lind? Sure. Correct. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. Charlie. How about the Charlie Weaver? How about the Gornie Weaver? How about I mean, leave it out obvious. How about Rick Weaver? Huh? I mean, I'd say there's a guy. I just, I just, I think getting the blue, the, all the, the, the place election. He's right. Yeah. He did a great job here. He wasn't a very pleasant guy. And he smelled real bad. But he, he gets nothing. I mean, he almost like chopped liver. He just vanished and like nobody other than Hank worked with him. He was fine by me. Treated a little people. Okay. Okay. Well, there you go. No, he wasn't, I'll say it again. He was a real eagle maniac. And I remember Bill Carter in his wife and the Rick in his wife. And I, we once went to dinner. And I'll, Rick talked about the whole dinner was himself. I mean, there's a whole meal was consumed with Rick. We were talking about Rick Weaver, which it wasn't very great company. But, but anyway, there's a guy died. Not that he's a bit was a big celebrity. Or in the category that kind of people were talking about. But just goes to show you in his town. If you could make any marks. Yeah, like even a mark on the ground would like whatever you got. Like if you have a like a chicken farm, if you'd like to leave a little pecker track behind or whatever you leave, you know. It's a miracle because they forget they blow you off here like nothing, you know. Just like that Bob Gordon called me on there. Remember that? Anybody know who that is? No. But I remember who it was because he had a great looking son that I heard at W.S. News. That's why I remember that. Or the good news is a stake in check after the hockey game after leaving a game flying out there to make room for stake in check Saturday night. They got white people working in the drive through a game. Some of them anyway. Oh, I feel better. Don't you feel relieved about that? The home would yell at me. It's coming. Yeah. It's structured. And it came a sweep. It's the apocalyptic music event of a summer. It's the great boode in concert. And if you make it out alive, you'll be grateful too. It's the big grateful you're not dead to us. During the grateful year of bunch of fans. Good-lage men playing psychedelic rock songs about peace and love while a new generation of angry and fans. You totally missed the point right in the parking lot because their pissed off and the boomers were taking all the dooms. Ultimately forcing the local authorities to cancel the show to prevent further injuries and lots of lines. It's the big grateful you're not dead to her. Coming soon to event you near to you.

Here's a mobile and Merlin, Merlin, hello. Hey, I knew I'd go today. Okay. Hey, I was just thinking you forgot why. I'll open a statue, but it affected me with Stanley Kubrick. Stanley Kubrick? Clockwork orange, you know, full full metal jack. Yeah, I know Clockwork orange. I'm trying to. 2001. Right now. I think I was going to want to space the, uh, innocent space space, space, space, space, and it's two, two, two, two, two, two, three. Space, two, two, two, three. I was two, yeah. And then you don't think that the North was in that one. Yeah, but actually, we're at Clock Clockwork Orange, to me, was the one to go because that's kind of how about Malcolm McDonnell? Oh, try the white. Okay, everything. I know he's not that. I just was checking, you know, testing him for his knowledge. What is it? What is it? What did Grayberry's dad do? But he's quite. Keith Herring is some artist. It's a blabbering guy with a polyethel in it who the hell Keith Herring is, okay? I don't even like pickled herring. I sure's all not going to be a concert with Keith Herring. Anyway, Stanley Kubrick, you know, was a great guy. And it was, uh, we're not putting him on list. Would you put him on list? No, I'm not asking you. He has not belong on this list. An addition to what James Dean is just so, like I said, he made three movies. And it's all hyped anyway. And anybody out there who's affected by life and James Dean must be some faggot, okay? And us fags have put a lot more important names on it. Like how about Freddie Mercury? How about it? This is named a long and a list. Since they did so well musically, huh? You were going to be a big song in an answer. So we're going to the audience about my taste, suck like crazy and Queen, right? Right. Right. All you had a sexual relationship with him. He didn't put that quickly in on there. You put in Kirk or Bane in the same category with Freddie Mercury. What do you mean was doing stuff actively as in the roundabout? That's a point. That is a point. A point. Because if they if they're retired, if it's over, then they're not going to affect your life when they die. Come on, he asked for one's the last time that Queen came out with a CD. I don't know. But everybody has all this stuff. For example, John Wayne, I grew up thinking he was dead. So when they told me that he died, I didn't care. I grew up hoping that he'd be dead, okay? And eventually, you died? Yeah. So what goes around comes around. Now I'm not going to, uh, not even look pretty on the list. Freddie Mercury? Yeah. No. I just was testing it. Now you can't see it. So I put in every dead singer on the goddamn list. I mean Jim Morrison, John Lenin of course has to be on lift echoes without saying. But Jim Morrison didn't represent something that anybody like John Lenin did, other than maybe like drugs. Oh, here we go. Oh, and there's the cheerleaders on there with their pompom's Trent Lott, son CNN right now. Discussion? Yeah. Our runs are, you're so big. I will bless them a soul with wrongly some Marie. Now we got a fervor of the family tree. I'll stand in the grave and I'm about to throw up. I can't get his ass. I'll back it get dug up on home. Oh, yeah. Oh, I'm a little rattle in the house fell off. So cold in the grave I got a nasty cow. I can't get pops pop in that. But a cup I'd love to say. I'll back it get dug up on home. Oh, yeah. Well, I'll break his jaw and give him two black ass. The nose will swell to his original side. I'll play tears again till he's all gone. I'll bend him over while a chair puts off so too. Me, your favorite, but you love me. Bring a back hold to the same material. There's a lot of love and pity by the god of beat up. But I can't. Oh, let us forget dug up. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. Yeah. It is some body's dignity. 16 to 0 to 560. Everybody in their brother, not only in the opinion of who should be on list, but how we ought to do to list and it's amazing. We're going to have like 50,000 votes on this thing. They say, uh, it says hand bishop, but affected white water. It helps eating ass. That's pretty interesting. Right still eating ass is what I'm hearing. Oh, there's going to be a baby. What if he ever got into Diane Maggames? Here's Chris Folly, Merlin Monroe, Lucy, Chris Folly, no. Merlin Monroe's on the list. Lucy, a ball. I love Lucy. Rock Hudson. I think rock Hudson belongs. I don't know if there's a very a fags out there. No, it's not that there is big, but the fact that, uh, now see you're again, you're missing. You're just not getting it. Why can't I communicate with you people out there? And this one in here. I get it. Which public figures death affected you the most? Right. He died. The fact he died from AIDS was the first, uh, personality, public figure who died from it, even when we lied through his teeth, to law was too late and could lie anymore. Do you know who the first or just, well, tell me who was. I don't know. I was a, he was the first. He was the first. Well known person who, uh, anybody even knew head AIDS. It looked like Robert Reed. They died, they lied about that. And they found after long after his death or months after his death, they found it on his death certificate. And that's it. He lied. He tried. And he lied. Yeah. And I had Brady Bunch thing on, um, MSNBC, uh, Florence, heavier sentence going on with her thing, a Western oil that she's care. That's another thing. You know, she's always got that, uh, jug of Western oil. Just in case it's a, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You know for no. Just to keep it handy in case. But anyway, and she's going out of a well, you know, he was such a private person who was nobody's business. Well, I have mixed feelings about that. Plus the fact that he was a real, like a, on top of that. Do you ever see that thing? Yes, I did. How can you miss in the way that he was, uh, been system on the script, being entirely accurate, looking up things in the dictionary. I mean, we saw a silly show. He took himself way too seriously. And then, of course, when they give him a chance to do those stupid shows, the variety shows, and he was on their singing and missing and dancing, that was okay. So we're not putting Robbery on a list. Okay. We'll put Rock Hudson on there for us, take a list. Okay. How about Judy Garland? So I'm aware. I mean, we agreed on her music. She was the best. But no. I'm allies of Manelli. She's not dead yet, but many of us are. I don't want to say hoping. There would be bad. That would be bad for a monocone like me to say that about lies of Manelli. That notorious bag hang. That would be very bad. Can't stand that bitch. Here's what it says. What about Jesus? There you go. Oh, yeah. What would Jesus do about this list? Now, we all put sloppy dresses on there, okay? Here's an interesting fact from Keith and four Myers, who says, how about my pet dog or cat? He says, I don't let publicity determine the severity of affected my life. Can you imagine that an affected losing tiny or your big dog would have a new versus the death of Hacks and has been to because of the notoriety. We're wealth and the drank and drug themselves to this. Maybe I'm a court-art instead of a bitch, but now you got a good point, there Keith. But that's not what we're talking about. Nothing did when Lucille bald died. The effect was as much as when snuggles died or something like that. That's not the point. Or like when your father died and you know, you wrote you out of the will or something like that. I mean, there are people I'm waiting to see there were a bit you're waiting to paper every day and I keep checking. Still not there, dammit. By the way, Keith and four Myers says, PS is raining here so we'll be able to catch you from noon at two PSS. Schroach is definitely bringing that property by the way. Thank you, Keith and four Myers. Here's another one that says, mother, Theresa should be on your list. She died at almost the same time as Princess Diana, but the world paid attention only to death of Diana. Mother Theresa was one of the few great non-Materialistic humanitarians in the world since they've been keeping her skin. I guess you're figuring about the fact that she caused all that misery and suffering just like the Pope going around preaching all that okay at crap and making people a lot of unwanted babies and speaking out against the use of a contraceptives and settlement so on and a Bosch and things like that. Just like most people in the hierarchy of the Catholic Church and in a flitor of pain and suffering and a rickled up old bitch on top of it, they showed her for about 15 seconds that we can and all the rest of the time we had to see Diana who allegedly was young and glamorous. Well, they got the young part right. Was she beautiful? No, she glamorous? No. No. She was just another plastic bitch from that rural family. Just another money grab and bitch. Here's one that says, George is right, only those people who died in their prime preferably from some violent calls for a massive drug overdose. There you go. That's a good idea. Now we'll get Kurt Cobain on there. No, don't, don't do it. What do you got there, Beast? I didn't mention what a great job the Beast did here last money and actually said good things about me on the year over the weekend which we heard. Thanks, Beast. It says, how about Joe to measure your Andy Kaufman? No. How about Ralph S. Kaufman? The George S. Kaufman, whatever his name was. Ralph Kaufman's a harness driver. How about George S. Kaufman? How about Penn and Surf? How about George M. Cohan? Right. How about the Eddie Cohen? Nothing to say, Marty Cohen. How about Andy? How about him? Can't be right. No more praying. Joe, the man, do you want to say how that have you gone? He belongs to an elistice. Sure, why not? Oh, Marilyn Monroe could be on there. Although I don't believe that you already actually touched her, you know? Oh, probably a couple times. No, no, no, no, no. I'll say that. That's like a Justin Pinkerbell there, like in Whitney Spears. You don't really believe that, do you? No, he heard it. That she was Charlton Joe. Oh, really? Yeah. I have a great line for that, but we need the job. Here's one from Harris who says, this is a baby woman, the death of Michael Landon, and the Nasdaq, sure. I feel like there's someone. Yeah, the Nasdaq, that's my favorite. Yeah, whoever Nasdaq is, he's dead. Down another 14 right now. Michael Landon now, what a quote. And he described probably saw the thing. Also on MSNBC this weekend, legends and headlines is whatever the thing is. The same six shows they have over and over again. Michael Landon was good. Little Joe. Yeah, I look pretty good to his matter, fact. Little Joe. Little, no, he was not a Joe. Sure he was. Once he, Michael Landon was a Joe. That's one little house on the prayer. You've never heard the word Jesus in the church. It was always God, this God. But he was playing a priest in that one show. He always was the last, it was not us. The one they did before that. So he had the collar on, who was playing a priest. He was connecting. Michael Landon wasn't Jewish, trust me. I don't trust you when it comes to the church. Okay, if any Jews out there, George comes here says trust me. Don't do it. Not a good idea. I love this. Just like when I get on the train and the Amsterdam, ahead of for a colon and the German police commander say, trust us, I say no, I don't think so. Just those are Israelis. They don't trust them. I tell them if you're on that. Okay, Michael Landon's not going on. But he was, you know, he was significant. You know, he had not a lot of work lately, even for a code act, but he was pretty good. He had a big hair. He was good looking. He was very good looking guy. Not that he would know, but he was, he was no John Schroeder, but he's not dead yet. So, John Schroeder, who's that? From the dukes of hazard, was that a night? Did I say Schroeder? Yeah, you think it was a room show? No, I'm thinking of her Charles Schroeder. Show's going to the dogs. Linus. But anyway, did I say Mc Schroeder? Yeah, Mc Schroeder is a really good guy. Let's hope that he dies so we can talk about him. I think his sits was finally cleared up. His tits is I didn't know he was Jewish, is he Jewish too? What task did Michael Landon was Orthodox? Okay, anybody out there know that Michael Landon was Jewish? I don't believe that. Dinosaur was Jewish. How about her? She dead? Done a sure? Yes, she did. I think so. See, you say, Ian, you're sure, really? What? You never saw that? Yeah, yeah. That was what she was famous. Oh, couldn't sing a lot of a paper sack. See, you say she couldn't sing a note, but she was okay until they did this as your life without February. I've told this before her name was Rose Fanny Shore, or something like that. And when it came out on there that she was Jewish, she had a look on her post like, oh, where do I hide the tits of, you know? Man, where do I hide the Mazuza? Here's my milk. He left upon the heat. Okay, good. Nice talk of Dia. That's not like Bob Gordon. Here's more water Dia, hello. Okay, how you doing? Pretty good. I'm like, before I get to my Michael Landon was Jewish, he had some Polish, his real name was a Polish name. Paul. Was he? I don't remember. I wonder how he was about him. Is after he got diagnosed, I think he had pancreatic cancer, which is like a death sentence. Right. He came on Johnny Carson. I don't know if you were to show the clip on that on the show. I'm talking about an MSNBC. They showed that. I mean, whatever actually, what a setup up the guy. That takes some balls. He went out with players. That's right. He had low press conference. Then he came on Carson one last time. And he died. You know, I mean, you know. Sorry. Yeah. This one, I don't know if anybody's mentioned it. It just, what had happened, it hit me much harder than I would have expected. And I think it goes to prove how good of a job he did and what he did. And that was when Harry Carrey died. I felt just so sad. You know something, I have now George W. I'm a great majority. I'm not a sports nerd, but I'm a carry. I'm putting on a list because you know something. You know what I can't. I thought somebody's other day, when I got my satellite dish, I started watching the cubs. Because I don't care about the cubs because they're Harry Carrey. And then after he died, I stopped watching the cubs. I don't care about the cubs anymore than I used to before. But I watched mostly for Harry because he made it exciting and entertaining. I was in college at Michigan State, actually. When he first started broadcasting for the cubs, it was on the cable. Hey, new. Fuck you. Right. We had nothing to do during the summer up there. It was barely 80s or a regular session. It was at least the top of every afternoon. I just started to eat and just like if you was your friend. And when he died, how about Mel Allen? See, that's before my time. But I'm not knocking it. But I could have not burned. Prince. How about Bill and you? Okay, you're going again. How about Boston and you and you go before I die. What did Brooks? But you understand what I'm saying. These guys were good at what they did. These sportscasters. You really felt like they were your friend. And when I went to Cooperstown and you have Harry bottle cat. Cop bottle glasses there. Right. You know, you just said, oh, it makes you feel sad. So it's kind of strange. But yeah, you're right. I'm putting him on the list. Well, that's good. I wanted to what was one other thing. If I can't opt to stop it. You said you wanted to the hockey game Saturday? Briefly, yeah. Yeah. I didn't go. I went to the hockey game. I was still going. I flew out of there. Even though I was going home while we watched the rest. But that was a disgusting performance by Louis Terrible. I went Friday. Which was an exciting game for two periods. But the Saturday game I had on the TV. And it was a seven o'clock start. And I think this tells you that one of the things that's wrong with NHL. I also put on at seven thirty. I don't know if you were aware of this. Was Michigan State University of Michigan, reporting in the CCHA final. No. So it started to half hour later. It was one that's small-dish on Fox Sports Detroit. It started to half hour later. But it ended in real time about five minutes after the Panthers game. Because they don't have all the PS. They don't have all the music in between everything. Right. They don't have all these commercial press. And hockey games is no and now worth a crap. I don't see that. We allowed blurring music just driving the people. Not to making you deaf. And so you can't hear the people are talking to you. This game was three times more exciting than Toronto. Right. I'm sure that. And in addition to what you mentioned, and I wasn't going to bring it up. But it's really an nauseating, but typical to me that they had standing with only Friday because Mario was here. Right. There's the best player in the world. But Mario is nearly as there's a difference between being the best and the most exciting. And Pablo Burri, like I've said now, since he's come here, is the most exciting player who plays the game today anywhere in the world. And he is so much on fire now, it's unbelievable. And yet they will not pack the place. And nobody comes to see him play. So the idea that the hype, once again, the hype wins over. And I got standing alone. They've only started out there because Mario was in town. But Pablo and they can see 41 times a year. Forget about it. Anytime he touches the puck, I mean you don't know. Not gonna out that I'm saying I'm going to see him because the rest of it is pathetic. But Jesus Christ, I mean there's no comparison. And they don't appreciate what they got. But I just thought it was interesting how much quicker the game went and how much more exciting it was without all that crap. Yeah. Well, today, it took me the can't speed it up like a baseball game. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. I agree. Okay. Like one of those four all baseball games. Five to end. It won't be long. I've got a lot of guillotine sucking this morning. They're up there at the in Vira and guillotine. Oh yeah, well, I'm sure you know starting this year. It's going to be a better team and the fans will slowly start coming back. Man, why are you such a suckhold, guillotine? Why are you in the people on that morning show such little suckholds? Huh? Except for Joe that let the Tory have a deal. They didn't even, David J. Neal, I score in their Schwarz, Schwarz boy. I guess it must have been his question. I got it erupted in the press conference last week because he wrote a skating commentary about the Tory and his interpret behavior in commentary. And I score on their David, you sure got that Michael Russo beat that little top of crap. A compland? I don't know, but man, but I trust you, Arthur. I love the Hillard. I want a boat, a train, a train, free out to the ball. Ten eight. Three out to the crowd. Five in the evening, Jack. Two Jack. Five on the catch fire. Just back, go, wait, screw. Look what falls up. Call me if there is. Go with me to the shenanigans. Fall right. What? Two, three, five, go. Five, zero, four, go. Right. Yeah. I'm glad I called in because that's going to be my vote. So I'm sitting here doing this survey that I, in generally, when I take a poll, I got some idea what my vote's going to be. And I'm looking through this list here and to be honest with you, I'm pretty damn unimpressed. Huh? I'm not saying it's not a good list as far as the choices, but I'm talking about me personal. Was I all broken up with our Charles Schwarz guy? No, because that all we comics. I mean, I'm not that I never read peanuts. And peanuts was okay, but no difference to me. Jerry Garcia. Am I a deadhead? No. I don't think so. I would be cut dead were one of those times. I'll tell you that. Although I do like Jerry Garcia. We wouldn't have no fish for it. We wouldn't have no cherry Garcia if it wasn't for the grateful dead. Frank Sinatra, Jackie. We're looking up and down this list now. Looking for John Lennon. Eh? That was sad. Gun down and like that. JFK. What have been my vote except for the fact of this guy called in Harry Curry? Plus the fact that was 38 years ago. Although there's there again, there's a difference. So we can argue, go into the finite about, you know, whether the guy was in the prime of his life, and the guy was still a present in Harry Curry was a dottering old guy who kept having these strokes and falling down. So you know, that's part of it too. We'll be doing that on our next survey, which one of these died the most gruesome death that made you like, you know, pick your guts up. Does that impact it more if they died, you know, tragically suddenly if they were sick for a long time and you knew it was coming. Well, and they have like figure, like in figure skating, they get points for that, you know. Style points. Here's a mobile at North Miami Beach, hello. Hey, yes sir. Somebody that's like a grandfather or an uncle that died, comfortable old to Charles Corral. Oh. Hey, we, you know, I've known it's expected to make the list. No. He was a great guy. Yeah, he was okay. And the Frank Vapha. Hey, he was okay. He was in the thanks, man. Okay, see you on the cockamoon unit. Anybody ever check out Moons unit? 560, 560, 560, 560, what the hell just thrown on there? Oh my god. Oh. Oh. Facts are just pouring. Oh, is the Rochester Donna bombs thing. Can't you miss the beginning of the show? What was that? She keeps moving. It's just on the... Yeah. Your favorite. Queen, Freddie Mercury. I know who it is, but I mean, what are we going to do? I'll explain what's between. Oh, I see. Michael Land and his name was Eugene Maurice Orwood. I told you he was Jewish. Eugene Maurice Orwood's. Oh, Gordon Farris tells New York what a javelin throwing scholarship to the University of Southern something. It doesn't say what. There's no, say, camping or university of Southern, but that ends there. Well, I'm sure there's more of this coming, whether good stuff started. Thank you very much. Are we ever going to get this pool going? Huh? Would that have get a call in Eric who better get it up into pool too? Because I like to have some votes on here before we lean for the day. Five, six, seven, oh, five. But we have the host still take some other ideas. We're probably say, uh, no, to most of them because we don't want to get Eric or schooled up there. We've got plenty of names. Which public figures death affected you the most? Damn it. JFK, Bobby Kennedy, Martin Luther King, John Lennon, Elvis, Princess Diana, how about the Lindwood baby? Dale Earnhardt, John Wayne. How could you say John Wayne doesn't belong in a list? That is so ridiculous. Not going to have affected anyone. Did you die? It'll be like in the last three. Jerry Garcia, JFK, Jr. Frank Sinatra, Jackie, Phil Hartman, John Bolusian. I don't think he belongs on that list. Probably not. What the hell? OK, put him on there anyway. We're scaled. Yeah. Well, we had a lot of people like the animal house. Right? Blues brothers. Blues brothers? How about the aqua? Oh, he's still alive. Charles Schultz, Marilyn Monroe, rock Hudson, Jordan, as you and Harry Carey. He died. Yeah. Here's open park, hello. Hello, I'm Neil. Yesterday Dave K. But I got four names for you there, enough to please. You know, Dick, Dick, Jamie, dying, extra area for all. Uh huh. The honor book. OK, great. 560, 560, pound 560 on the AT&T. The movement movement and Verizon wireless one. That was pretty good. One that good? Here's the lady mobile and lady, hello. I need a one of my that affected me the most with four good Marshall. Really? Yeah, that's a good Marshall. All of our right is we know it or not. How about a regular Marshall? Yeah. How about Peter Marshall? I don't know about that. From the Hollywood Square. I think he's still alive. Yeah, probably. OK, thanks. Thanks. What you say? Third good Marshall, is he going on a list? No. No. No. You talking about. Well, I mean, she's being honest with the affected her. She shed a tear to. She sat down and ball like a baby. And that's just the way that she just sounded how it affected her. She won't think about many of you people out there. And this is very important. Some pearls of wisdom from the fatta will fag on a radio. And that is that many people, especially in this country think that there is like some kind of a uh predictability. There's a former like people are supposed to behave or react in a certain way. It's like the poor question. You believe in God is there at all of that crap. Do you believe in heaven and hell? All of this garbage. And when you know, and people may come up with some odd ball things and who do I'm I to say that if you thought that when Ish Kabibble died that was like, or like, uh, Hermione Gingold, maybe like Hermione Gingold. George is looking like who that was at. No, I'm not going to be a business. Someone was you. Who used to be on cruise show. That's book of life. I'll give you a whole life story. Come on, again, Gingold Hans Conrad. Panama and quiz Mike Stokey. I bet she's dead. Oh, no, not Mike Stokey. Jesus. Oh, Christ, there's so much of that going around. So, you know, different strokes for different folks, different strokes. How about Marie Stoke? Who? I have no penis. Where did the I know this for sure. This place is a sh**er. I've done better dives than this. But someone turned on the f**king light. Yeah, strange things I have done. Or should I say that I have ordered it to be done. Like cooling round with people's meatchaps with a gun. But things goes for fun. Hey, it passed but time away. But look at time to pass away. So, though I may be gone, I'm not forgotten. I'll just keep them closed. And smell kind of rotten. I'm just real worm who's afraid of things in this box. It's so delicious. It's so delicious. It's so delicious. Which is to get some food. I hate when that happens. Well, this thing's here at the long feed on it. There is self food. I don't really love that. Okay, it's 15 at 5. Here's the info on Hermione Gingold. How do you like that? Tied May 24, 1987. A cardiac problem said pneumonia. She was 90 years old. She was best remembered from her role in Gigi. And of course, notable TV gets appearances. Hermione Gingold. Anybody know who that is? No. Just mean vocablion who ever fact me this. Anyway, Michael Lange went to the University of Southern California when a javlin throwing scholarship at the USC, but eventually launched this scholarship due to a torn ligament which also led it in his athletic career. How you liked that? He could have been athlete. He was the only actor so far. Oh, they're hockey and banging again down there. They're banging on it. I'm whether that's Frankie trying to bang his well or the box. Michael Lange was the only actor so far to have three consecutive shows on TV. Each of which ran for five years or more. Which they pointed out in that very moving piece on MSNVS. He should be on our list, shouldn't he? Yeah, I think so. Let's get Michael Lange in on there. Maybe it's a big story. I'm sorry, but he really got to be on there. I'm not sure. I think they're cost nothing. Huh? Yeah, put Michael Lange in on there. I bet you get to a few vote. Anyway, each of which ran for five years in marble, and answered, I think 59 to 73. Little house on the Prairie Rhymes with Mary. And highway to heaven. That's why we had the Getschkees go collar on the priest. I believe. And toured at Hillside Memorial Park, Culver City, California. toured. Turd. You toured. Right. So there you go, Michael Lange. And he was a good guy. Never stole a freight train. His idea was to portray the put television programs on without sex or violence, which, of course, a lot of us. We could do without the violence part. But out to sex part well, we're not too happy about that. That's when John Shroud, I mean, John Shnider said. I got to get me credit for one thing. I didn't watch that show. Dooks have had it. Did not watch that show. Much as I loved John and Shnider. Couldn't I could not handle it. Couldn't do. Yeah. Please. Is that what I'm saying? Even Daisy wasn't good enough. I mean, I like what I would like to get to pick him. They could just once. But I mean, you've got to admit, he was a good looking guy. John Shnider. Yeah, sure. Whatever. He was a very, he looked like a dump. Like what he was on that show, a local. A hic. A mugwamp. John Shnider was a very, very good looking man. And you know who played Michael Andon and the movie that they did on him? John Shnider. Very good. Good guess. For you to sit in that chair and to be talking about John Shnider being a mugwamp and whatever you would have all those other adjectives. John Shnider looked about as good as you can look. It don't get too much better than that. Okay. Trust me. I think from someone I trust. Who knows about such things. He was no Daisy. Shane. Here's Miami. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. Hey. What about Jim Hansen? Yeah. I've heard you mentioned that before, but it's over the people off the year, but I didn't want to repeat it. All right. Come on. Okay. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

What tells his name? Mr. Green jeans? Not Mr. Green jeans. Well, what was that show? I have to take a look. Captain Kangaroo was an obcation. obcation. Is he dead? I don't think so. Okay. Thank God. Because he would have to be on the list. He would. Just like to get a rough chuck would have to be on the street. Oh, no. Mr. Green jeans. Yes. Yeah. And I think money rather. Now, how about Mr. Lera? What's in that plain backpack? What did you call Mr. What? Mr. McNack? Mr. McNack? Mr. McNack? Yeah. Mr. McNack. There you go. I think it was a silly start to do with the bankfights there at the hockey game Saturday. Yeah. It's a chanted boy. Yeah. Saw a couple guys trying to, you know, rub their hands up and down on it. So there you go. Buffalo Bob and Jim Henson. They're on the list for you. Painting the S. People. Keep persisting. But Buffalo Bob definitely. Well, now as we perfect this thing, you know, we'll find some really important dead people. Who just, who's death's just traumatized you. Maybe you want to sit on the curb side and cry for days. How about Claire Bell? Who? How about Dayton Allen? Well, I'm not Dayton who? You don't know who Dayton Allen was? No. That was his famous line. Why not? Well, the finger. He was with a finger up in there. Not this one. But yeah, from the Steve Allen show, which you don't seem to have too much fun. Memory resistance is before your time. How about Jackie Greason? What about him? He should be big down here. Sure. Arthur Godfrey. That anti-Semitism. That also. Get into the street after freaking out through Godfrey. We all watched the huddle. The huddle. They call Heinrich Himmler Street on the way on the beach. Can you, I still can't get over the thing. We'll take that name off of there. Arthur Godfrey Road. Is the FBI building still the J. Edgar Hoover building? The gay Edgar Hoover now. Hey, how about him? How about the death of J. Edgar Hoover? You're gay. 567.0560. Pound 560 on EA. This is good stuff today. Good. Good battle on our hands. Princess Diana is in second place. Oh, no. Behind whom? John Lennon. Oh, has seven. Much, you know, I can live with that. He didn't. Diana's got six. JFK 5. The Leron Hart's got four. John Belushi's got three. So I guess that he did belong in the list. Phil Hartman's got a pair. Harry carried with two one of which is mine. Frank Sinatra two. Martin Luther Coolds got two. How come he's only got two? Charles Schulz has got one. How could JFK be on here again? Oh, JFK. Oh, no. Junior's beating senior. JFK Junior's got five votes and seniors only got one. I could have told you that would happen. JFK Junior was about as important as a fruit fly. Oh, no. He was the crown prince. He was a king. He was a Bocleva, which I'm sure tasted a lot better. He was a good looking man. He know he was not. He wasn't even that. But they all kept saying. Over and over again. The media. Senior was a good looking man. Bobby was a good looking man. John Henry was a pile driving. I never saw we got something to buy on the ball club. Uh, Jordan as you got one buffalo. Bob's already got one. We just put him on there. John Wayne with one. Jerry Garcia was one. Nobody else has any including poor little Michael and don't have any. How about if they're death because they thought he was you positively. If you wouldn't have said he was Jewish, what? What if their death actually cheered you up? Does that warrant of vote? No. You mean like JFK Junior? Oh. I was thinking more along lines of break at you. Oh. He's not dead yet. But boy, I can just I can see that. I don't want him to take it personal, you know. But I can just see you dancing. Oh, this might be Eddie and the where's it? What's Miami is getting around? Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes. I don't. No, I'm here. Good. John. The dying thing was to go on around. How about Mort Boss week? Yeah, Mort Downey Junior, but I don't think he belongs unless to you. No, the opposite. Oh, okay. Like maybe what George just said about people you were kind of happy about. Exactly. Anyway, I was at the game. Tyler United section 102. Right. I was hearing the guy squeeze it. The bag. Yeah. Was that something? Right. And when Toronto tied the game, I thought someone next to me is kind of. The only guy in the vicinity copy with the other. Maybe Jacket. Uh-huh. Get that with you. That was me. Then I didn't see the rest of the game. No, after the third after Burr got to third goal, we flew a lot of there. I said, let's go. Get to get the whole lot of this place. But they came back. They came back. I saw that. But I mean, they missed the bus. They didn't even show up. And they still won the game, which you'd tell you a lot. Well, like the paper said, the final score was leaves five and burr eight three, you know. Right. No Robbie. Well, that must be it. Well, I don't know. No, it was no Peter. Well, I wasn't done it. Yeah, no Peter. Okay. What's that? Cool. Good question. Yeah. I'll talk about John Wayne today. Uh-huh. I'm an asshole. Oh, he's talking about Dennis Leary. 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T. And for, right, that's pretty long, you know. What's that under? That's just under plain old asshole. Yes. Put it to see. Oh, yeah. It's under plain old asshole. I'm not going to play it. But I figured it'd be much more to taste. Give that guy a little taste. The discount. Where's work? Okay. So I'd like to see. Just a little bit of an off-the-bed is that. What does that mean? About the weather speed. About the way our American parks be. Number time keeps you a lot of the weather speed. You know what I mean? About that special feeling. I think it keeps you a big out of my, uh, into the lane. Not a lot. I think that's it. I have to go ahead. Keep your big out of my bike. That's what they say in the locker room. So what are you doing there in the dark? 560-50560. And maybe he was listening to FPL. He was doing something with a light bulb. 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line. Quirdon Cheechio. What about Robert De Nero? He's still alive. How about some like famous, uh, really, uh, how about a hungry boggard? What about him? He's dead. He died before most of us were born. Yeah, as a matter of fact. I never thought he would sell that much of a big deal, you know? Oh, well, you got it. No, you saw King Newton. King Newton was great. He was great at that. And my African queen to an extent. Johnny Mathis records. George likes the African queen. Now we're not doing the music stuff. Now we're doing dead people, okay? And he's still alive. George likes the African queen. Johnny Mathis. Do you fudge back him? Don't get him. Not misleading. Street to start with begging please. Barathees come in. How big you? You got a patch. If you're alone. You're a rich guy for you. Oh, Princess I don't know. Princess I don't know. He's really going to a tunnel. Hello, all. I think he's just sitting there. I've heard of it today because it's not an alight. Who's are? John 1116, Princess Diana 15. JFK 8, Dale Earnhardt 7, JFK Junior 7. Can you believe that? JFK Junior has got seven votes. That's the army junior. Martin Luther King's five. John Malushi five. Phil Hartman with full hair. It carried with four. Got my vote. It might be. It could be. He's dead. But boy did he make it. If he was like one in a booting. There'll never be another one. Fracks and after Elvis each have three. Well, thank the Lord Elvis only has three. That makes me feel much better about life in general. John Wayne with a pair. Bobby Kennedy with the two. Jerry Garcia and Joe to measure each have a pair. Charles Schultz and Michael and then Jim Henson each have one. Buffalo Bob has only one. Buffalo Bob has got only one. Vote. What is wrong with you people out there. But here's a great fact. It says. Couple you mentioned that you mentioned the past. Elizabeth Montgomery William Conrad. Love them both. Both. Not just good actor and actress, but really super people tremendous people. And it says, here's a test for your listeners. Listen very carefully. All you people out there turn up the radio and just sit down. Listen. Here's a test for your listeners. If you really think of famous person as bigger lost than a loved one, something is very, very wrong to which I say. Amen. Right. That's why I'll let Fony bull crap with the TV manipulating the public with the JFK Jr and the playing crash in Diana and a car crash. Well, what the hell did she ever do? What did she represent? Especially the people in this country. How come all of us? Oh yeah, now she's on top. This must be bogus. Now she's in a lead. Put the ties in the lead. Yeah. She has moved ahead with 17 votes. This is going on. I'm not joking. That's what it says on there. This has to be today's bogus. You know, every time we do one of these kind of polls, there's one bogus. One just to piss me off. She represents silly people worshiping royalty. Right. She represents a snobbery and snoozeiness and silliness and a tremendous waste of money and a bunch of crap. The opposite of everything. And then that's just her. But also the, what's his name from the big department store that the, the the father-in-law? The Arabs? Yeah. What's that was his name? Adobe. Adobe. How do you do this? How do you do this? Something like the Al-Falal. Adobe. Yeah. Whatever his name was. Adobe. Yeah. If I had, there was, yeah, whatever his name was. Some laundry head. Anyway, here's what it says. The seven challenge you asked you now. It's, well, I mean, that's, first of all, they won't celebrities number one, but I mean, I can understand that before they won't. There, there no, oh, oh, oh, bad. That was bad. How about the school teacher? She still did. Clear another one. Please add these to the list. Speaking of dead people. Sam Kineson. And Stan Major's career. Very good. Oh. Now, here's what I'm going to have to censor. This is a little bit emotional. It says, one reason I love Michael Lannon was that Tom Jickah hated him. Jickah made him at some convention LA and asked him stupid questions to which Lannon ripped that fat schmock. It says with an F. Oh, Hugh Jazz. Ever since at a specialist senses death, Tom asshole Jickah's Tartistly Lannon, Lannon memory. I want to wish Tom Jickah could make your list. I would pee on his picture. It says piss. I pee on his picture every Sunday in the paper. And if I ever met him in person, I'd kick him in his ass. Tom Jickah is the problem in the South Florida can't get rid of. Signed Mrs. Jickah. Oh. There you go, Tom. They love you, baby. And they love he even better when you were asked. They have bogus one of his princess Diane. I can see the width of their coming in now. You're not full of loss, okay. But if you want to make you feel better. Here's Papa, no, hello. Hey, Neil. Yes, sir. Hi. I got to get my vote in for this guy. Not a little Williams. I was feeling you can disagree with me. Okay. Okay. Wait a minute. How can I disagree with you when you're giving me your personal opinion? This guy had a great influence on my life and music background. And that's Bob Marley. Yeah. Well, he made, he's on the list of dead people made a ton of money last year. If I can find that thing, if I didn't ship it, can it? He made millions last year. Three million dollars he's been dead for years. Yeah. Any died like at the peak of his career. I think that, you know, everything after that as far as Roya goes to sitting the same. Yeah, I'm on. Okay, man. Okay. Thanks. Happy your circus. I think I must have shmit can't bear list of it. That was quick. That's why there's just too many facts that's coming in here. And including one about Don and Bob's in Brighton, New York closing. Right next to the elementary school, I went to school. Don and Bob's closes. If I close on a chapter in so many of our lives. And did we get a lot of calls about that? No. Did we get a lot of response? No. No. Now I'll tell you one thing, even though I'm on this new strict, no eating thing. I'm going to have a white hot here soon. These next to a couple of days before I get out of here on vacation. I'm going to have on me a white hot or something that looks like one. 5605060, pound 560, where's the girl? On the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Here's Tamarack, hello. How you doing? Pretty good. Got some names to the list. Okay. Go chat and in Johnny most. Johnny most. We was wrong. I'm scared. I'm scared. Come down. I'm going to fix all the ball back. Come down. He was good. About 150 years old for Christ's sake. Who is the first one? Before Johnny most? Tell Shannon. All of them are Shannon. But it's suicide. Blow his face out. And now? He's going. Yeah. 5605050. I'll tell you who must also be on the cusp like in the bubbling under has got to be done. Deloise. He's got to be getting real close. Dangerous. That's about another half a pound. That's it. Here's the lady a mobile in four-laterdale. Hello. Hi. Yes, ma'am. Hi, Neil. I've got. I've listened to you forever. I love you. I've never called you before. Great. But I think you're awesome. Thank you. And I have a suggestion. How about Kurt Cobain? Maybe for your young girl listeners? Yeah. I guess we'll put him on there. I guess he must be on there. Okay, cool. Oh, well, he was pretty smart me, but I'll put him on there anyway. Thanks. Thanks a lot. All right. I'll go ahead there. Let's put Kurt Cobain on there. Huh? Make sure it's happy. Only because. I've got a little bit of drugs. That's why you're a drug addict. And it's one of those drugs. You know, he's like buying and selling. I love you. He's a good deal. He's coming up. What? He was also cut off right at the height of what he was doing. He was cutting it with the razor blade. Although we all believe that Kurt did it. Kurt needs a cock. She shot him. Yeah. That was music. Yeah. He was still a smart me scumbag though. Sure, yeah, but what he wanted was from Seattle. Pretend again, so were the candidates. They were smart me scumbags. They were like, yeah, just they were like, well, dignified smart me scumbags. They did it like more intellectual or a smart me. Like Ted David says about Wastley, intellectual law's biggest. The candidates were like intellectual thieves as opposed to like the mobsters were like more common. Because I guess they were tagging. Where's the candidates were Irish? Look at that's the difference between the Irish show mobsters in the Italian is that the Irish were like a little more dignified like, you know, pure man. If we lose the old man, 560, 50560, pound, 560 on the 18th, tea and Verizon Wireless line. What about Mollon Brando? He's not dead yet, but he's also got to be in the 100 bubbling under. Another three quarters of a pound. That's it. That's it. That's it. So we need to be careful. Dom Delawies, Marlon Brando. In a case, I missed it. The reason why talking about said people, John Phillips is this. He's pushing up paddies with Mama Cat. 60, 20. Come on, let's do it. I know that great the purity we had on that was we haven't been able to find years. Or something. Yeah, it was an ACN thing. And I, if I knew what the name of it was, I'd find it because I bet you anything anything it's back there but California's falling or something in the San Francisco Bay. I think you know I find it in there. How about Scott McHensey? Is he still alive? How about McHensey Phillips? Yes she's alive. She's Kim. She became... let's see what we were. California prunes. Not shit that's the only one. And by the way if anybody gives your prunes God. Get up there, dad. Right. Stick them back at him. You'll be shimitin' for days. Pack it in and hold it. Listen to the sounds of John John Paulie's play. You think they're both in the Indian they're like JFK. Good afford a better play. JFK, I've got to find the five. The five were so good. She's been driving that boat. Oh, I ... A very definitely head to B Teocomboon. Now pedzy goes into a zip bandize the day that good days from what they call the luckily 인베 he's first. Yeah the The third is Flatter 4. The third is Flatter 4. The third is Flatter 4. The third is Flatter 4. He's going. Yeah. 255. 60 WDQAM. Biography for William Conrad possessed a malifluent Bellaton voice. William Conrad was also the narrator of radio program escape. He was the original Marshall Mat Dylan on Gunsburg radio show. Born September 27, 1920, died for more than 1994, so we died at the age of 74. Not bad, not... I was fat. Fat. Jake and the fat man, cannon. Short live Neural Wolf. He lost the world who had a mad Joan to James Arnes on TV. He also re-insuspected comic huts as narrator of the Rocky and Bolvian Colt TV cartoons. Did you know that? No. I didn't know that either. That's right. Now I remember the voice. There. If I had to pick, maybe one day we'll do it. Although it's very difficult to deal with these punks out there. But if you had to pick the best TV show of all time, which how do you do that? Like picking the best meal of your life. The Rocky and Bolvian Colt, that's got to be right up there. Great. Yes. Tangle. There were no bad episodes. Everyone was like, and of course, another one of those shows that supposedly was for kids, definitely was for adults. Definitely, all the stuff on over the kid. Like most of my stuff goes over most of your head. It was the same thing. You know, sailing way over their head. William Conrad, good man. But you see what? You're missing the essence of this. The essence of Emerald. You know, I ever smelled it. Yeah, that's the essence of him. Well, when he dies, that's going to be, I don't think I'll be here. I'm hoping, though. But anyway, what, what, what, what's public figures death affected you the most in other words, like, brought you to tears, maybe? Now, when JFK died that brought me to tears, but I didn't vote for him. I voted for Harry Kerry. Did I cry when Harry Kerry died? No, no. I said to him, don't you have died. I'm not going to put that in here because nobody in the sod and so is who that is. All right. Thank you, by the way, whoever, effectively, here's that letter I was talking about from Dolores Tesla in Bointon Beach in the hardest morning. What did he hear this? The headings says, water saving toilet, question mark. What genius came up with the water saving toilet? The average bowl takes two or three flushes to clear and then almost have a boardwash handy to finish the job. In 50 years of marriage, three kids in ten households, they never had a problem until his ingenious invention signed to Loris Tesla in Bointon Beach. Whether that one is full of crap. Do you have one? No, a water saving toilet. No, I'll, I will pay to this. I do have one toilet that requires if you have like floaters, not in your eyes, but in your bowl. My toilet, the one in my bathroom, that requires like sometimes a couple of flushes. Sometimes I flush more than once. The other, the another bathroom, it's a little more suction. Now they, they do have, I know that sounds like very non-cuz medic, but they do have for household use now. They'd like the toilets we have here where they fill with those. No, no, but they haven't like that look better. They don't look like they belong in some kind of like airport bathroom or something. They work. And they don't waste all that water, right? Because it doesn't have to refill it. It doesn't work that way. It doesn't have a tank. It uses high pressure. Well, whatever it uses, right out of the way. Right? Yeah, right out of the ground. Here's what it says. You've got to hear your sea. How about you, Morris? I've been to people who are hosts in Jerry. What do you think? Yeah, you will. Well, I mean, okay. And I don't know. I'm just getting tired of adding more than the list because Eric is taking it. I've also put on Jim Morris and I'm there. Okay, Eric. You're not doing anything anyway. All the time that you spend put more stuff on there is less time eating. Now, what do you laugh about it? But it's too. I want to save his life. He's the great Eric is the best. Our website is Spectacular. It's one of the best in the world. He does this to pennies job for us. Making about six bucks a week doing it. I'm sure you can type with one hand. Again, a great line. But, well, seriously, lose some weight. Come on. I'm doing it today. And by the way, this is good stuff. This is a card. What is it? Champion light, which is like getting right without the sugar. I'm not saying it's delicious or like fruit punch, right? It's okay. It's pretty good. It's got zero or everything. So, thanks a lot there. I'll feed you all any whatever your name is. Bob, wait for your Buffalo Bob's real name. Do you know what his real name is? Absolutely. You will. You better strap yourself in and put in Jewish, probably. No. He wasn't Jewish. Everybody is Jewish. The pulp is Jewish. Billy Graham is Jewish. Was a beanie, doesn't he? Yeah. Buffalo Bob Smith born Richard Schmetz. Was his real name. How you like that? He knew he's Schmidt. Born of ever 27, 1917 in Buffalo, New York, which I didn't know that, but he's probably what they call the Buffalo Bob. Where you go with that? They didn't call him like you, the Cabob. Date of depth, July 30, 1919, in Hendersonville, North Carolina, Kansas, where he lived to 81, not too bad. Buffalo Bob Smith, sometimes credit his Robert E. Smith. It's how he do the time, it's how he do the time. And also dead, as you said, but we're not putting them on list because it's ridiculous. Ah, Hugh Brandham. Better known as Mr. Green jeans and Captain Kangaroo. Mr. Green jeans. He died. He died when he died. April 19, 1987, 14 years ago. And it kind of, I just looked at one and there on us, and just looked right on through. So a lot of dead people, we're going to name them all here today. Here's Miami, hello. Miami? Yes sir. Hello, Neil. It's okay. You know what happened? He heard this one, but I thought you'd hear it. Making mangle. How much did that before? You mentioned it. I don't think he had too many sympathy votes now after the way he did it around for that delivery. Yeah, but you know those are the old days where people play where you really really really really. Right, that's right. But they stayed on the same team for more than five minutes and they weren't making 80 trillion dollars. You're right. You know, that's true. And also Michael Landon, by the way, I looked it up for you. Eugene. Oh, what is the name was Oralwood? Oh, it's yeah. Yeah, something to you. Thanks a lot. Okay, thank you. How much he was Jewish? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, I'm sorry. This is the second one for all these sports. It's all going on the tour that I was the first one to predict that five years ago. I tell you, maybe more than that. I told you, escalating salaries out of control. Owners who just won't put their feet down and say, no. All these owners demanding more and more millions and millions from the public for stadiums and arenas for more sky boxes and millions and women and ticket prices just out of, just up for the sky. They have outright that public and they've pissed off the public. So, way to think the new format will be the other 20 hours. another sports is basically dead and also the XFL out through themselves because the NCAA's are on XFL last night's the most waiting in the history of any sports even the hockey game and lowest ever. Nice gone there XFL. So we can also I guess we can put them in a column of bed also. Now Diana's bogus to just keep that in mind about this video what's on the list. Princess Diana's got 30 John or 33 John Lner with 30 John F Kennedy 27 JFK Junior 23. They learn her 18. They learn how probably have more but you know, pissed those people off. Still Hartman 13 Harry Kerry and John Blue Sheet have seven. Jim Henson has six Martin Luther King with six. Martin Luther King has only got six. Where's all our brothers and sisters out there? Other busy women neighborhood just forgot. Buffalo Bob Smith with six. He's moving on up there to the east side. You'll see John Wayne with five Franks and after all this. How do you like that Mr. Naysayer. John Wayne, Franks and after Elvis Presley five a piece. So he's tied with two pretty damn big names. You blew up baby. It's out at the bottom. Well I mean it's not a lot. That's what he'd be one of the bottom three. No, he's not a bottom that's Ricky Martin. During our C and Bobby Kennedy Chaffer Kurt Cobain just got on there. He's already got three. I told you belonged on there. Charles Schultz, Michael and Joe to measure which have a pair of Maryland when Rose got one. Jackie. He told his sheet on prolonged on the list. Who was that that sucked me into doing that early in the show Jackie freaking. Oh, I'm all right. Some put some RT-Farty Faggot. Probably wanted Jackie. Yeah. There's another one on the glide. Oh, she was. I mean. And I helped him say there was very nice. Yeah, she talked like a retard. But she knew friends. Probably who was the money. That was, you know, probably who. She was a who. Yeah, she was a she was an absolute hunter. No question about it. She would they dignified her. Like I said, those people they did it like a, you know, with dignity, the Kennedy's the whole plan. Because she got more money. Just like the guy that's Skakele guy that offered a little girl. They did it with dignity. And then again, the rapist up there. And I want to make a look at that here. I didn't finish the list here. Dan, I re-footed. I get those back, my son, ladies. Jackie and also guess what is done. Oh, Jim Morrison's got one. He just got on there. Rock Hudson has. I bet your door is day was listening to the show on the internet. She probably vote for rock. How about if we just put the rock on that might do it? Here's a call from broker. Hello. I need a house going pretty good. Yeah, this show is probably one of the best shows I've heard in the long time. There you go. It's great. While this town likes dead people, you know, there's a lot of that going around here. That's true. Listen, George might be able to relate to this. This might be stretching it a bit. But two icons of the late 60s and early 1970s, Jimmy Hendrix and Bruce Lee affected a lot of people. Yeah, Bruce Lee. Somebody mentioned Bruce Lee. I mean, why do I come on the list? No, of course not. Bruce Lee. Well, the thing is is Sun died about, you know, the same right? Just wanted to move these in. Right. We got to have a two for them both. Come for man. He invented that. He created the whole idea. And they screwed up. How about the old guy that was on there with the pimply face. He wrote Ralph Machio. What was named it those movies, Marida? The Papoli. The world's name of those movies. The karate kid. Yeah, what about him? Oh, I know. He's probably dead. No, he's not dead. No. How about Ralph Machio's a zits. They probably dead right now when you think we go and sit here. They made it. Who's that? Ralph Machio. I think I married weighs like 10 years old. Seriously, when he was in those movies, he was already married and had like six kids. He was like 14. He was an early bloomer. Here's a mobile area where a rumor blomer is mobile or a four-laterdale. Hello. Mobile and four-laterdale. Oh, please don't tell me either. Gone because if they're gone, that means they're good because I got into the break now anyway. I must be by lucky day. Five, six, seven, five, sixty, pound five, sixty. Pat Marida still alive. Yeah. I know. I heard you look with Obi-Wan Kenobi as well. I heard you ever seen the two of him together? He's that. Is he really? Obi-Wan? Oh, how about the Mark Hamill? He's still alive, but boy, he sure came close. He's gorgeous. He was a scarf. I'm probably and like a skirt too, I imagine. Little pansy. But anyway, he's got a new face though now. Remember, Papa's got a brand new bag. Mark's got a brand new twist. He's the old one was better and a face too. A bride. It's the one to two hours. Never watched his hair or she'd have a cat, Kobe. His name was Kirk. Now he's pushing up their Kobe. Why have been rule from his chin? Do in heroin, Kobe. No matter what time and now it's Kirk they ain't got Kobe. He got high, except goodbye, then he died. Kobe. Made a million and an hour never took a shower, Kobe. He's a number one hit and haven't big much hit. Kobe. He only held his chin and shake runs with my thing. Kobe. Alright, so with your pills without don't take Kirk's way out, Kobe. He got high, sick, big, big, big, big, big, big. Oh, Kobe. Why don't you say five, six, you double your QAM? He's going. Yeah. So he's moving up already. We were right up on the east side to be up there with George Jefferson pretty soon. What else is named George Jefferson? Sherman, Sherman, Sherman, Hemsley. Thanks, Sherman, thanks. Kirk Kobe and his nine votes already. He just got it. It was like two seconds ago. So I told you you should have been on it. Nine, nine. He was a drug addict. He was a bad person. He was a bad role model. We're not asking about role models. We have a lot of drug addicts up there in this audience. Even the drug addicts have to have a role model. That's why George was a show sometime. Even the people we asked have to have a role model. Right, right? Five, six, seven, five, six, six. You know, I was showing somebody over the weekend that I'm telling you, everybody who seems that just instant ping in their pants. I mean, that looked white as well. If you could package that in cellar baby, you could be tear tomorrow worth a billion dollars. That look of disgust and in credulity on white lottery else, push. He's talking about eating ass. And of course, he tries to cover it up. Uh-huh. That car side, but she tries to go. Uh-huh. And he looks like he looks like he did just cut it off. That's what I'm looking at his face with a hatchet. Here's lady in Pepper Pine, so. Yeah, sir. I know. I might have one more person for your list. Okay. My husband and my personal, all-time people was worried over. And the possibility. Yeah, he was, I mean, he was great. I guess in the 60s and stuff. And then later on, he kind of made it come back. And then he had a, I think he had a heart attack. And so, all the more we're headed to our committee. Thanks. Thanks a lot. Bye. You want to know how he decode the honor, but you know, I won't put him on there. Because we have a group of four overs and fetishes down there. He'll have an expensive day in a pale-reventy significance. So unfortunately, I mean, I'm sure he could do very, very well, but so well that it would really like a skill. Oh, you got to make sense going to our consumers. Yeah. I'd to cover up our drugs we're doing here today. Isn't even a corporate in the building. How's my, how's my tragic, uh, PD doing in there? How's he doing there? Just woke up on going to be doing that song. Muff the tragic. So anyway, it's, uh, five minutes. He's okay. He's a good guy. He means well. He's harmless. And I'm not going to discover what he kind of does. He only does he, he like goes out in the hallway. He looks around kind of like a fireman, you know, in many ways. And he likes put, he likes to put out little fires. You know, he experiences little fires. He's been over here. Scored score. He puts it out. There's a little fire over there. Scored score. Oh, it's a fight, Greg. Scored score. It puts it out. Put that little fires. He's like a human fire extinguisher. Muff. Here's Miami. Hello. Hey, no, how you doing? Pretty good. Two new names for your lives. Okay. George Wallace and Bear Bride. Not right. Hi. Hey. I'm right. And Chris takes pretty hot to me. Okay. To, Christie, Brentley. David, Brentley. How about David, Brentley? Oh, he's still on. How much are you? Okay. I'm a Douglas Edwards. How about John Chancellor? Is he dead? We can't, I can't get the answer to that. John Chancellor and Vc. No, John Cameron's ways. He must be dead. He's definitely dead. Right? How about Ben Grower? We should have a special lady just for poker Brian for the game showed that people. I bet you don't think that you don't think he'll go on his favor. John Charles daily is probably in the running. Bob, that should go if he killed gallons right up there with Jack Ruby. How about interview come out, do I think? Five, six, seven, oh, five, sixty pound, five, sixty on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. This is a, this is a hoot. It's a hoot in the two. And I bet you would get like 50,000 of votes on this by tomorrow. If you watch, here's some of you. Real one. Just a lady in plantation. Hello. Yes, man. Hi. How are you doing? How are you doing? How are you doing? How are you doing? I'm a little disappointed that people think celebrities and singers. Although we miss them and they, you know, they entertain us. I have really made that much of a effect in our lives. I did ask them the questions so you can play me for that, but I do. No, there is one thing I've played for, but I'll tell you a little later, if you can get mad at me. But I just have the people out there to know. I don't remember JFK, but I do read a lot. And if JFK hadn't died and if Bob he hadn't died. And again, if country, I don't think we wouldn't have gotten Nixon. We wouldn't have had watergate. We probably would have had run over a great, certainly wouldn't have had forward. And I just thought that affected our lives. That's why we, I don't think the right wing, the religious right would have a hold on this country. If those people hadn't died. But what I'm disappointed about with you is that you put curf called in on there, but the woman who said they're good martial, I mean he's one of the finest people that ever walked there. If he was on the Supreme Court now, it wouldn't be like it was. You know, during that last episode. I don't disagree with her. I mean he was a great man and he's still trying to take a bite. But he wouldn't have gotten five votes. Right. And I'll hear what I mean. I cried when he died. And I want to tell you something, I thought John Schneider and person. Yeah. I never thought he was good looking. You know, maybe we have different tastes. In person, you know, sometimes you see somebody say, oh God, they must have a lot to make about that. Yeah. He is a hundred times better looking in person than I'm taking. Oh my God. So you think he's good looking. Oh my, he has still blue eyes. I have some blue eyes. Oh, how long was this that you saw him? It was about ten years. But his complexion and he's got he's just he's a presence. Yeah. I worked for an airline. What were the bolonum? Huh? I said put a bolonum. Yeah. I'm a blonde and I never went for blondes. But he was, I'll tell you when I saw him. He was, he's very good looking. Okay. But anyway, Kirk Tobaine's okay. But those other people really made a difference in our lives more. How about Penny Marshall? Penny Marshall? Have a great day. So yeah. Bye. It was, it was just a joke. Just a joke, little joke. What was that show? The Vernon's squirming? What was that awful? The interesting thing they did in the beginning about there with the song. Shalamil. Shalamil is a lot more. Oh my God. See, see, one thing about those people in New York, they don't realize that most of the country is going. Okay. So all of the New York East up don't be talking to you. It's never this year. We're talking about this year. Is there a walkie anyway? I don't know. But I mean, shalamil and shalamas will come on. Penny Marshall. Oh. Oh. I'm going to say, how about you, partial? Don't baby, complain with these titties. On 16 at five, 60, WQAM. Here's the fact that I just unload the compute on this from Lee and for Myers toest, so it's verification done at Bob's. I was just there two weeks ago. The one that closed yesterday is the restaurant on Monterele Waffin, who that was a satellite, satellite of the one at the lake. It is not done to original or the one at C. Breeze. They're both still open. How about that hot sauce? Has anyone suggested the shuttle astronauts for you? They're still they have but you know they're not celebrities. Like they were said until after the I think blew up. But anyway I don't know how how can you say the one on a maneuvering was only a satellite? I do understand the one at C. Breeze was maybe the first one and maybe the most popular. But the one on a maneuvering was like the headquarters of my life. That was it right there. Just blocks away from where we lived on a greener road. For whatever it all I was. Right there by the corner of a Monroe and wouldn't have been watching Brighton. Anybody out there know about Brighton? New York? No. No. What do I'll do people know? Too many people from New York City. New York City ain't nothing. Well used to be once upon a time. Used to be great. Now they got Rudy Julian and now they got the goddamn English stopper in there and they got all those Puerto Ricans messing up central park again. Yeah MSNBC yesterday they were showing like surveillance videos of robberies in 7-11 and all that stuff. And then they showed the videos that people took with the mosaic and everything on the jack morsale. You know the checker board thing so you don't actually get jack morsale. I've not done Jewish harness driver. What is it? When they don't actually show you the dirty parts. Yeah. Now they really didn't need any because there were so many people watching and grabbing. They didn't need any of that. They need to cover anything up. But it was a pretty disgusting was a bunch of animals in Barbarians their central park and believe me. I don't want to sit. Okay let's go to a mobile and Melbourne. Hello. Hey no how you doing? Are you sure? What about some like you have a tag of this toe when you do Bob Hope? Bob Hope. He's not dead. I will. He could be.

Oh hey it's my old friend Samadavis Jr. Hey Samadavis. We're all we're looking at the time. You know most my kids committed suicide because they said it was abusive father. Well I'm glad they're all up in now because it's weapon time. Yet remember about. Oh would you like to swing on a star? Be chicken heads with a crowbar. Oh god go got a tea time in 20 minutes. Oh. Can we apologize for the back quality that bitten our DCST but whoever we've done that had the pot opens or like head back and with some sort of light real tinny like it's kind of too a goddamn maybe like an orange juice can something like that. Because we don't want those technical sort of like that one spot that we're playing 80 times today here in a station that's got all the puking and popping and all those bits in there. Wow pretty embarrassing like a real radio station. Thank god we're working here. West Palm Beach hello. You know yes. How you doing? All right. I can be kind of at two.

His name is John Phillips to the Mama's and Papa. No no we are. No I know that. It's girlfriend. Okay thank you. So that was the inspiration to go home show today that's why he's done it but he ain't on the list and he ain't on the list. Hey everybody crying say we're a Papa now first of you was a one town of the drug addict and had somebody else's liver that he stuck a lot in nine years right. And why is that music so much? He wants to mess the beginning of the show. Sure I got my thumb right on it baby. We started out with Monday Monday which I thought was very appropriate. Oh you bet. What is this man talking about? Like I need to start it. So everybody thinks I need instructions which is fine. That's okay. Everybody's a program director. Everybody's an expert. Everybody's a poor take care of everybody knows their pool. Papa no big chillout. I left to take your poll on Colmyo and Hank called me to read this while he's gone about gambling. I've not permitted myself to even taste certain prices knowing that I can never become addicted to something if this black queen. Okay great. Here's a mobile in Miami. Hello. Mobile in Miami.

We're going to be auctioning off some rocks to lock from Bob Molly at the end of the show today. So we're lying up out here in the corner. We also got some good weed that they could teach in. Exactly. 560, 560, 560, 560, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Mobile in Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Oh yes sir. Neal I got one. I can't believe no one was right up the same. Okay.

You know what's what is it? We're too fat. And I keep telling you people about that and of course I talk of good game and I'm not doing anything about it.

We got three hours there between two and six that there's nobody doing live stuff out here except during the updates which is only a couple minutes out of the hour. Or man is just on. That's when you get your drill in your hammer and you start banging and it cannot get into an all-as-crap. There are a lot of things that would make sense here.

Yeah. 5607.560 why are so many people saying Bruce Lee even you two that I mean the beginning of the show what was it. Yeah. I was just a little kid. But I was going to affect you. It didn't affect me. Most of the people in the list I had no bearing on that. But why are all of anybody you could think of why would that affect you? Why would I have any impact? I knew that Bruce Lee and this kid both died the dude with their karate movie. We were trying to hear of a genre that I enjoy very much to this day. The martial arts movie. Well what about Ralph Machio? Even if he is his dead head. 5607.560. 560. 560. 560. And the AT&T and Verizon wireless line. I'll give you the update in a second here.

I won't be able to do it. Couldn't do it. Well she's got experience you know because she had her dog put away. Was it your dog? No well now it's her dog. See history is at times time. The passage of time it's just amazing how people change their tune you know. Yeah my dog became her dog and the story about how it picked up some poison in the backyard and was forming at the mouth and the vet could do it. It turned into a while she just got tired of it and was a real nuisance and she had to put this leap. This was the dog that was 10 years older than the time that could have either lived like 15, 18, 20, but she decided. So she had her dog put this leap. So she's the voice of experience just like she decided that my calendar there on the wall of the twins. That was that was bad then but was like last year's calendar. Narodic repetition interfere interfere interfere continue if she's on the enter and benefit interfere on. Yeah. My junior hot age. I'm the father's telly and I'm dead.
