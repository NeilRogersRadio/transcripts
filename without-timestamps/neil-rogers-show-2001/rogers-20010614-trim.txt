What you got to do is take a table below. I'm going to play a lot of stuff this week. I'll tell you that. Kids are out of school and they'd write. You can be a local. I'm just going to be going to the most. Kids in there are school yesterday with senior script. I was going to show you guys that they were trying to show us my music. The guy in the beach cops said this was the best behavior. The greatest group of kids. What is that? Why is it that Chris want to open the mic when we started to show that tapping in banging again? Do I hear her? Are you people crazy or what we're doing to God name radio show here? You asshole? I think it's downstairs. Yeah. And we're hearing it all the way up here on the third floor. He's right under our feet. He's probably that the Bob removes. He's an asshole. And the rumor going about building is that the reason that we can't stream the audio on the internet the way that Eric was doing it before getting all those videos of people listening is this just a rumor is that the certain assholes around here are like a dick with us. You know what I'm saying? They've dittled with our internet connection. Which is why now there's only like five people listening right now. Supposed that they're already be like two three hundred by now only five. And probably don't even like maybe ten by the end of the day because they can't get on it because it's dicked up. They much rather have you listen to qm.com or sound like it's coming through a stranger and we have the the meteorological thing the weather in the background while the commercial breaks are on. Which only they could do around here. I've got our Bob remote you idiot. So anyway, what we're seeing is for a break day. And they count yesterday and they showed the kids on the beach. And the beach police said it was the most best behaved and hottest wooden group or whatever they said. That's what they said. Yeah you enjoyed that. Hopefully you must have news last the news last night. So it's big and a young people we had our polyester. They have a drinking age and of course a miracle occurred. We had eight hundred and seventy three hosts on your rungies.com. Should the drinking age be 18 19 20 or 21 or band booze all together. Which we got a lot of band booze all about there. We just just put a hell of it. Just want to be wise guys. 18 wins hands down. What do you like that? On a rate of 173 over over half over 50 percent. And we lines that. 442.5 percent said the drinking age ought to be 18. 277. So now keep it 21 because we're all anyway. The agarity of that all of people over 21 are the ones who voted for that. 31.6 percent. Band booze all together. 62.7 percent. Age 19. 61 people said it ought to be 19. 32 people said it ought to be 20. 22. A minister will number the. There of course is between 18 and 21 18 wins hands down. So that we don't have to make criminals how the young people are quoted the president's daughters. Those drunken slots. That's right. Alright, they're embarrassing. And I think there's a goal in opportunity. If we had a re-eliter, do we have a leader? No. That's going to be our poll today because I want to give you chance to. You know, for a semicolon time, while you bushworkers out there. Want to give them an a high by the way. The good news is that now those kids have always had north by me middle school. Now that's cool, huh, and date, they won't have to like just, you know, catch a little listen here and there like in between low jobs, north day, middle school, north day, middle school. So I very happy. There's that all those kids from north day, middle school because we know you're all out there. And it was a good idea, listen to the show and said, listen, the crap that the chicken class, because most of what they're teaching is, you wish to time anyway. When you agree that they're going to get much better education on this show than ah, you bet. So our good buddy Adam and sales just missed the plane across the 95 by about what he says 75 inches last night. It started up by like about a half a mile. Then by the time you get to hear this morning, it's like, you know, it's like people go fishing. Who kissed the big one, you know, the middle, the Newton, you know. missed the plane crash, but just a matter of feed he said, and he just delighted to expect this will be here. Also, my different Jake Finder got the proper parking license. I said, hey, you know, if you're going to talk about 18 year old, they may not be able to drink it, but they shouldn't have been a parking park and floods their guts out. I said, hey, did you? I told them that they can drink and give me a dirty look. I said, oh, I can't do that. That's not what they have good idea. But they can sure come here and plunge their brains out and learn about horse racing and all of the good stuff that goes on like in the featured track last night. We're walling Hennessey's horse arm row, russia broke about 15 times and there was no inquiry and no this qualification and it became a official luck instantly right after the race. And they left them out. Nice going there, walling. As if he had one of the prices lately already anyway. The judges were playing poker, I guess you can last night. Maybe in a sound sleep. There's a horse that broke like four times during the race, no inquiry, no line. Not that it's all great, sign a nice guy, we did okay. I just mentioned that in passing. Dick. Here's our poll question today. And the name is, asnar. Okay, asnar. W. Prime Minister, not president Anne Zarf. Oh, man. You know something he is the definitive Goeisher cup. If you look up in the dictionary, Goeisher cup, he has pictures right next to it. So here, and there's still a hawking down there on the wall. There's still bangin' away. Not probably going until two o'clock today. Probably it's just probably Bob removed down there, banging on a pipe for four hours. Just to get even because he's a prick. He's a Yahoo prick. Which of these best describes president Bush? Will you be a five choice in today? Because we want to be fair on this show. Want to give all you bush lovers or a chance. Which of these best describes well president and take? Be wilder, confident, strong leader. Dumb or Alfred E. Newman. What are you talking about? What's the difference between Dumb and Alfred E. Newman? Well, I think Alfred E. Newman takes it to a new level, don't you? What, me worry? As in? Who am I? Yeah, kind of like that. What do you say, you sh'go? It's a 10 18. It's 5.16. But you're not a good star for Alfred Zarf. I'm a TV host, so far. This would be a pretty bad 19 votes for a full immediately. Which of these best describes president and GW Bush? Dumb? Seven. Alfred E. Newman. Six. Be wilder. Be wilder. Five. Strong leader. One. There you go. And confident. Yes. Zero. No confidence. But strong leader. One out of 19. Not too good. I mean, always got his finger on a button. His hands around the other. Strangely, the environment in the air that we breathe and the one that's the one in him, we're not even showing highlights of his phone party that I've been before. The phone party? What channel is this? 360, maybe it's coming up. It's coming. Charge work? I hope that was just a teaser. A little piece. The phone party? All right. 360 on your best small dish. And let me tell you again, you better get off for vision. Because if you don't have it, you're going to be like the Wolfway and in the dust. The best and investment in the history of my life. 565. 565. 560. On the 18 and 10. For as a wireless long. Got a couple of calls here. I think we'll play like all requests to freeze. I mean, the plane crash is very unfortunate because you know, people get hurt real bad and dying stuff like that. But other than that. You want to say it? Here's Hollywood. Hello. Hey, Mr. Rogers. How are you? Hey, I got one question. One question. Okay. The request is 100 years of gone by. That's a total of things forever. I'm sure you're looking to kill that. Exactly. Good. How can I say great choice? And also couldn't there be a referendum for the people to vote on the on the age drinking and if they voted 18 once the state has to go to 18. But who's going to put that on the ballot? Who's going to let us decide things like that? Well, couldn't all be like the bars, restaurants, night clubs, all get a petition together. Get it? Never. I'm going to happen. I'll never let us do it. Never going to happen. Okay. Bye-bye. I mean, I mean, I make all all the sense in the world like we would be elected. People decide. We had our survey here yesterday that people decided to drinking age out of the 18. It's as an honest ridiculous. Crank to driving age up to 18 and make the drinking age 18. Going to military 18 while they all these things, right? It feels wrong with that. And of course, blow a John's mouth to another story. Middle school kids are doing that now, so that's so different deal. After that, I'll have to lower the age for that, haven't I? Huh? You know, this one, Rurvis, they were about that. I've actually done a lot of conversations about that. Not, no big-they can't discuss that. When Sally comes home from school, and I can't discuss it. Hey Sally, are you like a hot many, or like to be in the school? Or like to. I think you don't have like a separate class with, huh? But all your kids out during dayd-county, we just hear, I'll just be on the safe side, okay? Don't be doing no dangerous crap. Somebody looks dangerous if it smells bad. Don't get near it. That's my suggestion, too. Make sure you take a real good close examination of it before you get too close. This thing that a couple people fast me is that they're shenan, They're website, I would question and instruct anyway. They're real good, like in a case of like a major emergency, like when you're blowing up the world, something like that, they're right there to show us all the end of the blood and the guts. But other than that, no wonder nobody watches it. But they have the, in fact, if you check out CNN weather, that's a classic example of how stupid they are. And even over a year, when I'm over there, I'm CNN international, and they show the weather forecast for cities around the world. They're not even close, they're not with intended views. If they tell you it's going to be raining in 45, the sun is shining at 68. They just, so they did this thing, and I have no idea where who compiled this or where it came from. Maybe somebody would be kind enough to let me know since two people bothered, facking with this. America is most 100, thrilling, flicks. I mentioned this the other day, and they got psycho number one. The godfather is way down there at number 11. Dracula, which ought to be in the top five, that's way down at number 85, 85, Dracula, which actually a lot of people probably wouldn't vote for number one. That was thrilling, that was scary. That was really done. Yeah, they got psycho and jaws number two. Yeah, jaws. That was really thrilling. In fact, also on the list, they got the number 31. They must be at that, well, what's his name? The godfather is on his list. Number 11. There's a lot of people who are there, and they're here. The godfather is on his list. Number 11. There's a lot of people who are there. They're the godfather. They're the godfather. They're the godfather. They're the godfather. They're the godfather. They're the godfather. Number 11. Did Richard hadn't called you by the way? Yes. He did? Yes. And he said, that's a talk about it all the year. What does that mean? He said, don't say this on the year, but it gave me message. What do you mean by that? He said, hi George, this is Richard Adam. Don't say any of this on the year. Do you have a big thing? Why do I have some kind of a problem now? No. Oh. But at least I got him to call you tonight. Yeah. Yeah. Why is he upset? No. Oh good. Don't be upset, Richard. I'm making your famous baby. He loves the attention. Richard is like an overgrown child. He walking those offices. He's got all these old, tube boxes and he's a collect soul crab. He's a great guy. He's just trying to get a whole just to art a grab a holder him. He's invasive at a looser. He's slippery. Like most attorneys. He's slippery as an eel. Just probably a Dracula is number 85. And I know where to go. Some of the crap that's on his list. Some of the most ridiculous. Where's it about? As number 43. Didn't you find that drilling? I mean, it was a good movie. It's a classic. Is it a thriller? Oh, no. There must be a lot of these people who have to be on drugs. But other swine, monkeys try to 50. Raging bull, number 51. Was that drilling? The raging bull was like the Rascal House of Motion Pictures. Rocky 52. You. Yeah, Rocky was pretty throwing one up. And dog day after you don't know 79, I was like, well, it's thought again, by the way. But I was going to get a drilling. It was Ted. What's the definition of drilling? I'll try to get my excited or get you. I'll try to get you. Trilber is like a, uh, chilling horror. You know, like, good night as you are seat biting your nose. Like, kind of saying, I wasn't doing that. So, uh, you know, get out of here. Didn't know what was going to happen. Surprising. I just went, I got them seeing it again. It was still drilling. And it's John Voix still hanging out with a few of the machines he pennies. If he were, if he were a quick to deliver a rocket to the team, what was his name? What was his name? What was his name? Ratsville might have been okay. What does that name? I don't know. Where'd you go? You don't know. Dr. Hoppin. That was his name was Ratsville, wasn't it? I forgot. And he died in the bus. Though that was the other guy. That's been hoppin. Are we talking about the same movie? Oh, don't. I'm thinking of you don't think about the John Voix. John Voix was in dog bathing. See, he was stopping right away. So, what was the name of that movie? When John Voix and Dustin Hoppin were they got on the bus, and they came to the end, and they were coming to Florida, and Dustin Hoppin cooked before they got here. Did I see that movie? Of course you saw that everybody saw that. Wouldn't my camping. The dog dancing always would help a chino. Right, in Florida. And Frado. Who was Mr. Ratsville? It was his mark. Not done. I'm Chris Ratton, who was that screaming queen. Yeah. And that was not true. That was not true. I was a rich, adicoc, adicoc. Yeah, I liked that. That was not true. I was talking about the heat. Yeah, that was good. Maybe it'll be pretty soon the anniversary of Ratton. I guess the guy will call him. Tell the cops. There's that two-hole of the sexuals in here. There's some time over here. Yeah. Now, what was the name of Chris Ratton? Oh, I forgot. Those were those. Now Frado was the Indian, right? Yeah. And more than any Frado. Is he still alive? The active, I played Frado. The Alpistino character was funny. Oh, there are no people dead. Listen to these testimonials from people who said, I'm a real pain in the ass. But nevertheless, so we didn't get him to call that was nice. Also, we got some bad news. What was the guy's name Danny? You want to hear this? One of our real loyal listeners passed away. And we want to send condolences to his friends and family. And we can't afford to lose any better guarantee of that. Can we? We can't afford to lose nobody. Also, Brandon Miami is the one on the other guy who is out of control on the Facts machine. He's a good guy, but now we got to America's greatest movies. Well, we're going to be more famous. Okay? I'll save this for you. Okay. I'll call like a slow day. We won't have any of those. No, you want to have any of those this summer? Now, we're going to get those out of the way the next week. But anyway, Brad and Miami is also a good guy. But it's quite a fast. And the guy says the first and only x-rated movie ever when the Oscar was Midnight Cowboy and he's right. You are. That's so ridiculous. Right. That was good movie. I want to say it was like a troller. Why did I keep forgetting to see that? Is it because you don't say it? Well, that might be it. Oh. Oh, ghosty cruising. Not saw it. You did see that? I didn't know it was about Fag Hall. Man, it was too late. Oh, geez. It's too late. I'll write even joking. So that very discomforting. Yeah. And also very contrived and very grotesque and very stereotypical. And nasty. I see people who fit that stereotype. Carlos? Oh. Oh. No. I'm not being taken on. Again. 10. Forty. It's always nice to have someone to ride with. Although he really doesn't say much. He'd have worked from the car, mother. Oh, god. How many of you four, 11 and five, 60 WCM. Towards making out like a band in the other room, Kevin and Paul kinds of three stuff. Morton's stay constant over some of the stuff this morning. And some certificates, too, for three meals with my name on it. George has got it in this pocket right now. Have a great time, George. And Jones, whoever else is going. The Indian has to cheat in the autumn if the winner was going to be colder not. Not when you know in the answer, the chief replies that the winner was going to be colder than the members in the village were to collect wood and be prepared for a cold winner. Being in goodly, you'll let him want to the next form both called an action or weather service and act. Is this winner going to be cold? The man in the home responded, this winner is going to be quite cold in the evening. So the chief went back to speed up his people. He told them to collect even more wood as to be prepared. Which later we called the National Weather Service again. Is it going to be a very cold winner? Yes, the man replied it's going to be a very cold winner. So the chief goes back to his people who are going to go find every scrap of wood in the forest. Two weeks later we called the National Weather Service again. Are you absolutely sure that the winner is going to be very cold? Absolutely. We made a study of the weather man replies. The Indians are collecting wood like crazy. Not bad. I had a give it about a 1.5 on the Richard scale on the scale 87. 140. By the way, like I said, say that list of actors in the movies for like a slow day. There's no calls on it. There's nobody here. All right. The people in data are all gone. Thank God. And the people in the bird like red and the age of their sheep. They're happily in the airport. We understand. This is surprised me. 5.670. 5.6. If there's any interest in bottoming one more day. I just mentioned this in passing. 5.670. 5.660. 5.660. On the 18th. Hey, listen, I know that's a minute. Today, I don't play in anybody. The day that the kids get out of school, anybody with more than 50 cents is long gone. And more power to do you have a great time. 140. What's in our pool? Because they come in from the outer, you know, the outer limits. Which of these best describes El Presidente President Bush? We have you five great choices here. Be wilder just leading into most of the earth. It's pretty tight. Be wilder 37. Dom 36. Afro-Denumen 33. Who am I? Strong leader 24 and confident 10. Only 10 say confident, but strong leader 24. Uh huh. I sure believe that. I'm buying that. Here's a call from Papito. Hello. Uncle Neil. Yes sir. I'm miss you when you go on your trip. Easy for you to say. Well, I just came back from Italy and France. Really? Wanted to give you a quick review of that. And I want to also show you a little bit on the bar business and 18. You all just got like that. Okay. You're going to find in the bar business that a lot of the clubs nowadays, they don't want to deal with the 18. 19 and 20 year olds. It's just not worth the aggravations, not worth hiring extra security and things like that. So the guy that said earlier, if there's some where you can play, so we'll wrap around them or whatever. There's a few bars that want to dance clubs like Atlantis or somebody's other places that want to go after the younger crowd. But for most, it's just not worth it. They don't go out and bite dinners and stuff like that. So that's a big reason. Okay. So now regarding Italy, I, uh, flew to Paris. I took the train down to Tolus. Played rugby for a week in Tolus and everything was put nice down there. And it took the train to Italy and I went to the Vatican, went to the city and chapel, walked around the city. Oh, I see. Stay down to the M.A. as you'll now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I went to the mountains of Trevi. Um, it was a, uh, being Italian. I was able to speak the language a little bit. So I got around a bit. And I took the train back up to Paris. I got on to say something that even the M.A. is me. It's going to be a few. The people in France were actually pretty decent. Uh, I heard the belief, but, uh, if you start by saying asking them nicely if they speak English, or you want them to, you don't speak French. Um, I guess the country, the tourism board in France has said to these, uh, to the citizens. You got to be nice to the people because tourism is one of our biggest, uh, um, they're not to done that like in the last couple of years. Yeah. I heard that before myself. And I mean, when I went to Toulouse, which is obviously down by Spain, it's totally different area from Paris. People will different. But even when I was in Paris, I was asking directions out again on the Metro people. People were nice to me. I was amazed. I was absolutely amazed. So I'm going to miss you when you go on vacation. And Amsterdam is definitely on my agenda. I've heard that you're going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. I'm going to be a good one. Then they came a little bit deep into my room and you saw the one. Yeah, we don't have stir dams for a weekend. And they never had been there. They never had been there. Oh my God. Yeah, up next major trips can be back to Australia in 2012. Okay. Hey, with me out, you got a lot of time Toni. See, guys, so that's God from doing a few places. Actually we have like summer if that's people. I'm sure that there's some high rates people. I just have an TM yet. 560, 560, 560, 560, on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless Line. Midnight Cowboy, John Hoyt, to an limbo rocket, the T-room with Shishi pennies and Westland. I guess maybe that was where he was bringing Ratso, was to Westland and that probably was coming in and just couldn't quite make an adjam and it's snowy bus. Was this illness that drove the most attention at bus? Here's Miami, huh? You mentioned the movie, cruising? Are you saying that it's all that snow that's up to happen? No, I saw one on Instagram, I said it's an old research of all kinds of crap happened. Most of the research from the R-true. Most of the R-true, yeah, it's not a single R-true. But if I take it from the 150-true, I'll be people being certified, I do that, they can be treated in a serious type. Well, I would guarantee it, and more than 50% of gay people don't, I didn't involve them whatever was increasing, but have a good time doing it, okay? She had Westland sweetheart. 5,6,7,5,6,5. In fact, we could do a story about the colors, couldn't we? And the facts were wrong. And it would be true. I would say just off the top of my head, I would have just taken about this before, so matter of fact, from the light of the call to the bus, stereotypes, I would say that 75% of the colors are pure on an elevated crap, okay? I'm not just on this show, don't feel bad. All shows. And by our calls are great compared to the calls on the sports shows. Oh God, there was an old soccer call, Hank, was it not the one about the heck family in New Jersey. That was a better call. Something about the ones that call about horse racing, because unfortunately, the only ones that we have care about horse racing are harness racing are old-farts like me. And the rent, anybody out of these are 100, doesn't care about that. And this guy was going on, I was screaming at the radio, screaming at the top of my lungs. Oh, about some race here that he had bell-mont, was Jerry Bailey, and he did a bad ride, and Hank's thinking about which race that was, this call that was the death now of top radio. The death now, even Joey Reynolds would have been embarrassed by that call. So please, don't feel, don't take it personal on this show, but just an all shows in general, 75% of the colors are crap, which is why we try and this show to go through it like a billion calls, you know, because any of my kid a few good ones. And on the fact machine, I would say the opposite. I would say, no, no, it's about 50% of the stuff that comes in is either in form of an average, and using some good, as Joey would say, fresh new comedy, or, yeah, and then of course, the other 50% are chronic cranks, and, oh, it's just beautiful. People who hate me, hate your, both of you above, but wouldn't miss it for a second. People who are hallucinating, who have no lives at all. And I'll say it for the eight minutes, because I read the more I say this, the more I believe it. If Tim McTray would have had a fax machine, that building would be in one piece, and 160,000 people would be alive today, or now dead. Trust me what I tell you. The fax machine is the greatest outlet for human frustration and psychosis in history, that's the catalephone. No, no, even above the gankas, see the telephone, even though it's anonymous, there's a voice. But the fax machine is totally anonymous. All right, there was another story about another epitaphile. Most in somewhere heard, I'd like trying to get a 50 year old boy up for sex, that they named on the internet. All you epitaphiles out there, I hate to break the news, but every time you're talking about, like a 13 or 14 or 50 year old boy or girl on the internet, it's a cop. That's what's going to stop my just messing that in past, and all you maniacs out there. Well, I'd better stop, all you Peter files. Yeah, well, listen, when I was talking about those young girls given the head in middle class school yesterday, George was like hanging on the tour clock on the edge of the seat. What time did they get out of class? And he's really pissed off that since we're in day counted at school, it's out now. Just in time, by the way, I mentioned that in passing. All you want to read was a few. Like when you saw that, who were you just good thing you didn't see that? The phone party? No, no, not the phone. The phone. The phone. Yeah, the newspaper. Yeah, that was last night. I'm Miami Beach, where they all were having a great time and walking around like naked. Just about. That would have taken me back. You'd have to look at the cop-up for the fact that there's all this old sexual and an adult school. I was bought by a huge one that bought everybody down, sort of speak. And anybody believe in that? No. He was just like, our imitating life. And that how goes the other way around? He said, don't call me art. Anyway, so I'm going to know three of five, 60 WCOM. That does here. A French woman, Catholic, Bishop, by trial for covering up for a pedophile priest. Oh, not another pedophile priest. Oh, my God. There's a fact in the church. Admitted to a court yesterday that he focused more on helping the vegan clerics than eating the victims of their families. PRPCOM, Bishop of Bayouli, Zeus. That's the other thing about the French, their language is disgusting. Which is just hate, ooh, Nick. Didn't even like that. Didn't even do this. I think I'm off for a Schmidt. Spoke on the first day of his trial in the Northwest and town of Cayenne. For family that turned in a priest later jailed for 18 years. For the rape of one boy in sexual abuse of television between 18 and 1989 and 1996. The can, 66, that he confronted father of an abyssey, rhymes with sitting in January of 1997 After running a one of his case, but still the follow-up of the other cases, the priest admitted to during their talk. The failure to investigate what had happened to other victims was a lack of vigilance on our parts of the bishop, visibly annoyed about having to discuss sexual acts in court. Instead of informing the police because, said he sent this down and retreat and then had him seek satientry killed. He transferred this edu in nearby persons of September 1998, but the priest was arrested on pedophilia charges a few days later. What a surprise, what a shot! The can is the first French bishop to face prosecution for a failure to inform on a pedophile priest. Although similar cases have arisen in other countries as victim to the sexual abuse by clerics, increasingly blamed the church hierarchy. There you go. So not only are the pedophile priest yet victim to now, but those who stood by and kind of assisted by their violence and federal and so on, they just kind of moved him around so that they can most other kids farther away. There are God going to the spy and were too to which we say, all right, long overdue, even though we know. There's no fact in the church. On and on this show, we know that. Now, it's just a plot.

rationalization if it was your kids out there that got busted for uh fake ID and underrated drinking like a couple times within six weeks nobody would be saying oh gee everybody's doing it they'd be kneeling their eyes to the wall isn't that interesting? do people like we're gonna bring morality and decency back as in bio being the law? oh no no they break the law but it's a good thing because everybody's examining that law and it's not a good idea which I do agree at any good idea but guess what they're not there not to be in a position to be breaking it how do you like that? don't confuse

and let me tell you this is 25 and 30 year olds are like assholes too yeah yeah have a great day okay so we just don't like kids in this country that's basically a little above down to because this country so immature anyway even the adults are mature that the kids are like five year olds that's why we have a drinking problem and a drunk problem all these other things and you go to other places and guess what they don't have that big problem drink it as you can and like somebody verified yesterday I was why did 19 are they running around drunk on young street are they like killing children in the street oh no no big problem that I see so it has to do with the people that's what it has to do with when you continue to repress and repress and treat people like five year olds they generally behave like five year olds that's why the gun thing is the way that it is guns inherently in and of themselves aren't even were bad but the fact is that when you're responsible juvenile people have guns and access to gun they start killing each other what kind of stuff how do you like that how do you like that oh here's more friends from ringing the James who the last couple of years but by the way thanks very much but no thanks been fact to me about shit rich and how about to buy it this price and sell it that price I'm not I'm not playing the market my friend but thank you so much this is a good guy send us a lot of faches not interested I'm not if I want to do my gambling I've been pretty little a very low level gambling a palm at a park when a few bucks here lose a few bucks there I'm not in gambling anymore unless I go to Vegas I'm two old and two people the start gambling away all my life savings so I give it to somebody I can trust like mature that's right so it was just for me but this guy says long long term it should be okay shit rich long long term like in other words if you love long enough you're my kid you're my kid you're my he back with don't hold your breath something like that 270 votes on at Pelso Far take a peek at this I'll present it to you in very poorly which of these best describes president Bush dumb 74 the world is 73 Alfredi Newman 65 a lot of people I don't even know who Alfredi Newman is any of he still got 65 of those votes including mine strong leader 34 confidence now that you mentioned it never seen it to him together I didn't know he could play the banjo though I said we have one president played the sexist phone I would go in a fifth banjo he's picking it 560 70 50 60 when you liked that there's sitting over there it did one of the big conferences in Europe and all of a sudden he pulls those little banjo and said trying to get kind of like a distraction you I thought it takes the type of guitar out of here from the scene how to dumb you see I'm kind of like a little distraction after you Newman plays the video banjo 560 50 50 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon where it was why he's got the years for it maybe it's like Ross Broder we can fill in here's ladies for a lot of their hello yes man yes I don't know if anyone is in the what's up with hot-twan yes but that will use the Jamaican version it's a broken English where it's really broken French but yeah I'm a mistake for broken English which how to make and take part in speaking part which is broken English oh my god how a verse now you do not know because it's like a comfort zone for most Jamaican or wherever we're talking English in school we're speaking English right when the time is appropriate uh-huh and uh-huh when is that like alternate Sunday if like I'm speaking to you now I say but when you're among your own people you'd be speaking uh-huh right what's Ross oh well that's a cartridge no what is it you like if you that's a lot you're gonna certainly I could tell you I'll see you too what I would say that now but use Ross for the curtains Ross you that's where maybe the next Jamaican university Ross you Ross did.

more like a woman wrote educated thing which we got really I was talking like baby talk, you know, I just bought my car with mine. Yeah. Like my friend would talk like a butt plug private school kid and told you to start talking with his mom. Guys, this is what the British did to the afford your make-hones and all those people over the West Indies, man. That's what they did to them. But I keep in their thumb on. All those brits. I could do like a long time ago. We're bringing right hunting to show about the silly brits. You can do like, you know, do hours and hours about them. Those constipated brits. Those silly quits. Here's a mobile and time or I'll come on. Hello, yes sir. The graduation photographs. Anyone that out there that had been to a graduation or parents were able to take photographs freely. Right. Those that the parents go up, they try to stop the kids. Have them pose on stage with the friend's folder in front of the people who were politely seated while trying to watch the graduation. Yeah. And by the time that one parent is done with what they want to do on stage, the agents are out of order with the people that are hitting their clothes. And it's much better if you're not to have parents out taking photographs. And again, the call probably just doesn't want to pay the $10 to the side for the contract, it would be on stage. Hey, he's probably just a cheap skid. That's right. That's right. What is it? Probably a waspard. How did you get that? Thank you very much. When you say a waspard line that cheap guy that was made a big son there, we can't find a friend of the hero from date anyway. Well, I was making a big son of that. Oh, that was our friend from the movie was that talked to receive like David Brian. And they agreed. She had no she had them. Five six she had an old 560 pound, five 60 on the 18. And I can't stand that that just drives me nuts that affect him. He will talk like this. She talked to their team. Man, like Dave old Brian, how you all rated by the way, we'll take the books you're any day. Any day the week, we'll take the books you're over him and also that the David boy and God, all might not only a bad hero piece, but Colonel Colma inducing. How come they couldn't have made books? They made a main man on the radio. We'll be wrong with that. They just don't like him as that. I don't like guys with orange here. Oh, that guy's doing not that fat anymore. Still got on here. Here's my money. Hello. Yes sir. Hey, you know. Yeah, I went to a graduation ceremony yesterday. My son graduated from South West. No congratulations, you know. So proud. Yeah, they got his. The next thing was that FIU, the basketball arena. Right. And it was really great. And the parents were just crazy as club. Aaron Burrcing. The kids were 10 times showed their manners. What? The 10 times more than the parents did. Right. And they had to have all kinds of security there. There was a guy a professional taking the picture when the kids went up and shook the hand with the pencil. And then when they came off the stage, they stand on the flag and the sort of stage flag. They got the picture taken again. But the parents were acting like fools. And that's why they're doing this. I get little things same thing. Yeah, because it came back for our kids. I'll get into fishbikes and balls and I can like a bunch of people. I had to do it. There was a piece of white trash in behind me and she was effin' Cuban this and effin' Cuban that. And I was so embarrassed at the parents. And the kids are at the kids were excellent. They were professional. Everything was fine. It's been a long time because when you have to call out a thousand kids names, it takes a long time. Sure. And they're trying to speed it along so they had another graduation coming in after that. But that's why I had read the article on the paper a little bit better. The broader counties do in the same thing. In fact, some schools in broad would even allow cameras and video tapes. Oh, right. So I mean, the people that had kids, they sat in their seat. They took the picture from the seats. There I am. Hey, that's right. What's wrong with that? Why do they have to have like a special? See, all these people think that they're the only ones on the planet. Hey, everybody's sitting there with their 400-power zoom land. What do they have to do with cellophoto right in and they're right there? Just zoom in on it. Zoom in on it. Exactly. All right. OK, thanks a lot. All right, but. OK, here's the fact that they said, OK, here's the real Schmidt. The word Pet Pran. Are you listening to this? Are you not going to try to kind of guide them back full again? This is very important stuff. Who is that? Some of the bubbleclots. Oh, probably that fat arrow can be between the spaghetti sandwiches. He does eat sandwiches, but like with spaghetti meatballs, I'm just what I'm here. Yeah. Well, what he does is he takes 20 or 30 cans of beef or only. And shrimp, for your already, whatever else they got on it, like, wrap you only. And he eats it up in a microwave and then like, maybe he makes sandwiches out of it. He puts it on bread. Just kind of like that stuff will get them out of the crab. I mean, that could stuff that I haven't come in here. That's Flothy Joe's. Oh, I saw a man with spots this morning on the news. And it says right on there for Flothy Joe's. That's what Flothy Joe's are. That's something from South Orange, New Jersey, some regional crap. Anymore, you're going to get off that bad full mile talk about Pet Pran. Who's that? Hey, how gross. Yeah, that was Eric. Oh, we got 11 people that's down there, Eric. We've had probably 15,000 if we had this thing working right before. We don't care. Don't worry about it. And don't talk to Elvis thing. OK? I'll show you mine. It's time for the Little League World Series. And if you're kids a little bigger, make sure he has the right equipment. Keep trying. What's that you're paying us? A drinking. Ah. Sure, he has a bad end of. But when he steps up to the plate and grabs himself, he needs something to drip. He needs new, jot sucks. Just with a pair of jot sucks in his own race. Give your little leader that literally ball. If he can chew like a pro and he's looking for a good ball, if he can chew like a pro and spit like a pro, make sure he can scratch his crotch like a pro with you, jot sucks. OK, that's the funny we've played there because that's going to be my full question tomorrow for all the men in our audience who have sons. Are you embarrassed by the fact that your son has a much larger penis than you do? Huh? And especially for your son as well. You know, six to seven. Five six, seven, years old. Five six, seven, oh, five, sixty, pound, five, sixty on the 18th. And Verizon Marvel's son, just asking and passing. So when I hear the arrest of the story, it says also the, and now they have the bottom table, please don't much of what this came from I'll be in deep due to, but there's nowhere in the facts where you would know it. So I guess it's probably just as well because then I would be, wouldn't I be tempted. Huh? I never do it. If they say don't say it, I don't say it. Maybe it came from the Jamaica LMPC. Oh, and that's what it says on top from the Jamaican embassy and also which is West Plot right there on top. It says the Jamaicans have three levels of cursing. Bemma Klot is considered like the mildest like you jerk. Bemma Klot. Yeah, like Todd Jack. Bemma Klot. A blood plot is really his blood plot. Cot means clots. Somebody clots. They were talking about that grotesque stuff. Blood plot is a bit stronger, so I'm going to screw you. Blood plot. Last plot is the strongest and most likely to get you into a fight like calling somebody another effort or something like that. All of these things. Last plot. So very forms of clots. Yeah. There we are. Krissik. As in loin. Well, they're not snapping brushes. Do you make one the case you have an honest? All those I know just for. Yeah, well they can afford to. I mean, they're telling those expensive drugs. 560, 560 pound, 560 on the AT&T and Verizon. Yeah, blah blah blah. Wireless line. Here's why I'm panning, hello. How about the blood, co-sure, co-sure plot? How about the blood, co-sure plot? How about the blood, co-ma? You know, when are you leading? When do you last day? Soon. When? What do you mean? I want to hear the whole show I just wanted to sort it. A video part? I want to talk. I want to just make sure I hear your whole show. Well, you keep us been for a couple of days because it's going to be very soon. Any day now? Listen, put your ear right to it. Okay. And the radio too. Yesterday, soon guy called about the fact that you worked 20 hours a week and that kind of announced you. Right. You're last full. I hope that. But when you're contract is up and you want to issue this side to come back, I hope you work the rest weeks and you actually have all and get normally. Because you deserve. I do. Right. If you guys are three times the money that you can just for talking to assholes like him, you're right. I think I know when I was driving home. I could believe that. Yeah. But if it's nobody in this market, it's in close to you. Right. So anyway, you need to work less and play on or have more vacation time. Oh, right. There you go. Okay. Put your ear on it. And the radio too. Yeah. It's just astonishing to me. This time it's got more of those kind of people like that pump that call yesterday. You okay with that? You were 20 hours. You making all that money and you only would like you to make it. Yeah. You making it. You're making too much money. You sound like a jealous pump to me. That kind of call yesterday. Like a jealous pump. I was just booked me by the way up there in an hour. That's what I've played for. I'm not having a pump. Maybe in the pond would be even better. 5. 5. 6. 7. 5. Just warm and radio up for that big horticune game from Omaha. And those great steak houses out there. There a bit of Omaha. I mean, even though I see I was skeptical. I did the Kings games five years on radio. One you on TV. The RTV. We didn't take it on the hall. Because I guess they didn't like about greasy out there. I came like that. Or it's just between the blind. But anyway. 5 years in a row. We went out there. We thought I guess that was the lucky charm. That's a lot of phrase you said. Maybe it was those drug dealers we had out there for the team. But anyway. First year we went out to that Omaha. That's going to be like a real star deep place. You know, so they really burnt first of all. They got X-star been the race track, which is, you know, not the most beautiful track in the world. But they say they pump a lot of money through their all those damn farmers. They come in there. They're pumping it. And that was okay. And then of course the steak houses all brother. Those were Mr. Sees and Kinniglio's. I'm trying to think all the things all the other joints. Those were good places. And the people there. Lovely. Just beautiful. Just all smooth hard bodies. I'm talking about smooth hard bodies. Yeah. And the men too. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, 5, 60, only 18. To the kind of people like the, you know, you just want to reach out and grab. You know, you get smashed in the mouth. You want to reach out and grab a handful. You know what I mean? Grab a mouthful. Here's plantation. Hello. We are. You're a boss. You boy. Tell me now. All right. Here you go. Yeah. That was it. We got to Jamaica and go to the day, baby. Yeah. I know that church applies to me about one or clock. You know I'm a smell of cancer. Oh, brother. Ha ha ha ha. Oh. Cleo Junior. I'm calling him now. Call it like three reads in. Uh huh. It's Clemen Cleo. I want to like to make cool guy's names. I don't know about what like Joe. Joe Mama. Brian. Brian. That's a good Jamaican name. No, not sure. I mean like we know names like offer coolers and they charge you to like those offer cooler names. They have letters and thought club names. Uh like Anthony and Thomas. Oh, Anthony. And that's why I forgot to read the stingwish. Very extinguished. And the women that all talked down there and know and told us, you know, very, very condescending and very imperialistic kind of imperialist because they're British. And they're British were the most imperialistic back to the old time, right? They're a bunch of blood clots, blood clots, then British. Ross clon. You have you ever meet the queen? If you ever meet the old Liz, just walk right up to and say, Ross clon. And she'll do her little curchew whatever is her. We're supposed to curchew and then I'll get bitch. You know, the way we won't think of the queen was like the queen of unedilums. Who's just a figurehead queen Beatrice. She's a fan lady. She's great. She got a great sense of humor. She was out there in parties with the natives and the natives. She's at the person. But that freaking queen Elizabeth, you know, who are things or stuff don't stink. And the book that I read, the, what that was an name of that book by Chiddi, you know, I'm talking about the real family, Chiddi. Yeah, very good. It was Chiddi Kelly. But I read that, I don't know, few four years ago, back in those days, I was very fast and boggier, it's going to be after die croaked. She died over there. And that book was astonishing. And when Queen Elizabeth was young girl, she used to respect visitors to the world palace to curchie to her. Even though she was just like a little girl, just a punk. And the George, the god of the Elisabeth, was still working. Because she was going to be queen someday. Well, I'm a queen right now when people come in here, I don't respect they out of curchie to me. All of us is Todd Dreck. Next, you might have, last time, Todd Dreck comes in here. You tell them curchie me for the queen, okay? Or else, else he's out. After the rest of what is enough, you said about him off the ear. It's, it's not fit for, you know, how he's got that thing. You know, how he's got that piggy, let me story. About one from this morning. About the young. I forgot about the Jeff Cohen story. I'm not a story, but it's worth mentioning on the ear because George will be making the appearance of Pistol off the bar in IP between 6 and 8 PM. And just by coincidence, Rick and Susa later. Because they left him so much, they want to be there to give him all support for George's appearance. And the good news is that Pistol off doesn't sped it one dime to chief channel for this appearance. Are they? No. And the only deal is they per day agreed to provide pizza for us number of people and that said, but I've been at the Jeffwood and Waste his money on that thing. What do you mean? No, of course not. He called us more into like, beggar, forgive us. And we said, we'll think about it. And Wastplot by the way. What don't forget, when you go to Pistol off, down the way you get a great meal, they get a free Wastplot. And an analphing pencil vibrated. Yeah. Or you can imagine the combination you can do with those. I think first you use the vibrated and then the Wastplot. And it's not worth it. Yeah, you'll need it. Or just maybe a washcloth. Here's for a modern deal, huh? Hey, what's up there? Yes sir. Now you're kind of saying it too far. You have a slow-down blood clot. Blood clot. Blood clot, man. Rast clot. Rast clot. Exactly. Great. I like it. When you get to say it. Oh, bumble got Rast clot. I feel so Jamaica now. Maybe I went up on so Saturday. And then when you sit, you're like, which is a movie of blood clot. Oh, Rast clot. All right. Stay how to clear my mind. I'll write it. I don't like that. I don't know. I don't know. Jamaica and David this show. Thank God for that. We draw our supply with Dryup. So why don't we go over to your team. My drugs again for a few months. Yeah, I get another one of those taxes this morning. Very amusing. Very humorous. All these people just hyperventilating and all these and just imagine all this wild crap. Two guy may have heard from the hot case sex guy in a while. He's probably getting all worked up now. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60. The guy would know life in Opeena. Spongebob, 5, 60 on the AT&T and Verizon Rast clot line. Mung. Yeah, he's right. You have to drag a Rast clot. Here's a mobile in Western Hill. Hello. Hello. How are you? All right. I've been listening to you for 10 years. I think you have to reference it. Yes, I am. I want to let you know my daughter's life school graduation was last night as the National Parliament. Right. And you are absolutely right. The acoustic felt terrible there. They're deafening. They're deafening. It's absolutely ridiculous. You couldn't understand what the thing said. Right. And then there's just a reddit. And you just be with someone. No photographs or videos during the graduation as well. And that was what I just wanted to mention. Earlier this week, you were talking and you made a comparison of how these goody with Frodo. And you're the characters on how to do it. And the one character you forgot to mention was the most important one with this Collegal. Oh, my God. Terrible look on. How could I forget that? Right. That was the one you did. But anyway, I want to let you a great comment. And I look forward to your game. Okay. Thanks a lot. I'm here. Now I should mention on Monday, September 10th, that's the day I'll be coming back. I just mentioned that in passing month. Because these people were with the finger. They weren't spending a single solitary dime for like a billboard and then the guy was a paper for like a, uh, I come in. People out on street corners like animals, boys people. Heading out leaflets. The overtakes Monday, September 10th from vacation. They'll be back. Or salespeople could do that. They're not doing anything. Yeah, well, they do that instead of running around crying. Those things are bad. They're killing me. They're coming at Todd's record. I'll push you. But Chapel, okay. Stop running around crying like El Martino when they got father. Okay, you idiot. Rumor has it around the building. He was in their whining with screw-annas this morning. Oh, gee. It's a good time. It's a good time. Call up your body over there to agency guy. Moving it, talking back on. What do you think? Oh. What's that guy's name? He said don't lift off to him. 26 past noon at 5. 60 WQAM on our Jamaica. Thursday. How's it? Monday. It's Blood Dog Day. I just got a tip on how to use some of these in a certain way. Oh, really? Like if it's really good, what you're smoking? Yeah. He said this is some good blood clot. Yeah, man. Alright. Hey, we're going to be smoking that on the ear tomorrow. And on our website. Hello. Hey, tell me. Get the over. I'm demon, man. What's that man? Be true, in to you. I don't know. You're the hippie, no good. On this go back to jail. Ah, ah, ah, ah. Now, we pay that other smooth man who checked your money. Oh, no. Let me tell you something, girl. You could have given that money to me. I'd do that, babe. And I am out of the intent. If you were that stupid, I would take the right chicken bones and touch her up the spirit of death, too long. I'm glad you're being so fine. Help me experience the benefit of your credit card reading and help subsidize the ever growing telemarketing industry that cater to the unimportant Negro for only 690-9 a second. I will tell you what you want to hear and less than you already know. Oh, no. To good place. So to the very bone at your local check-ashing store. And I'll 1-800. Hmm. Hmm. I'm kind of sure it's how you like American charges. Remember they would be Jamaican. How they get one. They go. Oh, what a surprise. Do they like your Charlie, should I grab one? No, God. A surprise. Things like that. Stand on three corners in the hall or across the intercession. No, be fun. Your typical Jamaican considers the American black will be ungrateful and not happy for what they've got. Shiflus. Free loading. You don't know what you got money. Dangerous, that's cool. Yeah. Well, I think that's someone actually. 5-6-7-0-5-60. 5-6-60 on the X-Turb. We'll be making those generalizations. But that's a lot of fine black folks out there. And like you keep saying, you keep working on the Oma�y Sunday OV-1. 5-5-5-60. 5-6-70-5-60. 5-6-60 on the 18-T and Verizon Wireless Line. Oh, God. You have an 89 votes. You know, I guess I said, you have a 91 votes already. This could be a record breaker today. But I'm out morning at 10 o'clock. We could have like 80 trillion votes on here. Two-by-the-bottom can hear us on our website. And by the way, if you're having problem hearing us on a website, call up your or your or your explainer too. Not. Just a little joke. We just did joke. Do not call George. He'll trace the call. He'll have some look at Brassie coming to your house and be you to a bloody Pope. We can't scream in, okay? And probably thanks to the rumors that we're hearing inside are being true. Probably somebody in engineering here at Scrooves around. And cut us off from our source that we were screaming on it. But that's okay because this gives our fellow more time to eat. And that's what I'm talking about. He's happy about that. Try to 91 votes. What do you want? What are these best describes present and bush? We've got again, which of these best describes El Presidente? You will read 112. Dumb 102. Alfredi Newman 91 out. See because of the time, I'll release the open mad magazine. That's still probably. Yes. Even though that guy died. Dumb Martin died and also Gaines was that his name? William Gaines. But didn't really like the dark. Dumb Martin died. Spire is his spy, I'll ask her. He was a different one. What do you mean? Dumb Martin didn't just spy with first spy. He did the people was really big feet. Oh. Who did spy versus spy? I forget. Oh. But anyway, they still publish mad magazine. But I don't think it's as an anasy. He used to be one of the sort kids growing up on everyone who was the musk. And Alfredi Newman was like, he was like, right next to how he's doing. In fact, you ever seen him tune together? Oh, I rest my chest. It used to be good. Yeah. No, it's sweet. Oh. That's because all those people died. Because the publisher William Gaines. He died. He's dead. Anyway, which of these best describes President Bush? Beholded 112. Dumb 102. Alfredi Newman 91. Strong leader 53 in confident 33. confident 33. confident 33. That's only 8.4%. And when he asked Strong leader in confident together, only a 22%. Which means 78% say he's a bosom. And of course, you know what bosom did he retired.
