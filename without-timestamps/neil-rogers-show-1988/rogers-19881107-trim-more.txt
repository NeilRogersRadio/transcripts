Okay, can you believe this that we're actually over here? It seems like only yesterday. We were depressed and morbid and suicidal. And here we are in this beautiful, collatial studio and everybody is so friendly and nice. It's weird. Isn't it weird? And it's incredible. Anyway, good morning to 10.05 at 6.10 Wild. And this is our inaugural day, Bue, and which is always an exciting event. Let me just make sure I got everything technically straightened up. Because you know we come from a very up front and up type technical situation at the other place. Which we'll be talking about at length. Oh, good. Good. I just want them to get ready and get the machines rolling. I want to know what we're doing here. It was talking about this morning. The mystery picker. Did you hear him talking about that all morning? Launching the mystery picker. And I thought Mike just in a couple of days. We haven't even officially started yet. And we've influenced that man. Okay, now we got a mobile call. Look at that phone call. Not sure. We haven't given the numbers out. We want to thank Jane from Eats and Tree. It's been over tons of food. We have it open in yet because we know that there's a big. This is going to be our first and hopefully our only real controversy with the management here is about the food in the studio because the engineers and management are really uptight about this beautiful, palatial new studio. And I can understand that. I can relate to what I think we're going to do. We're going to turn this into a lunchroom. We can be real need. Trust me. If they've heard us before, they know that we can eat more and leave no trace. Oh, yeah. We're a little hands at this. And the Johnny Jesus bringing pizza at 11. So I don't know what we're going to do with that. But we're going to have to confront the food in the studio. We have to do a real quick. Okay, we got this mobile on one. Let's see if I can do this right. Okay. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm the inaugural caller. Yes, sir. You're number one, sir. I can't buy my dad. I am going to catch myself. You want a beaker. Are you honored? I've only talked to you once before. You want to write, go home and write this in your diary. I'm telling you. This is like the most impressive moment of your life. So where are you right now? You're in your car. I'm actually driving a dress one. I'm going to wait to downtown Miami with a 45 minutes delay that clearance that was only going to be 50. Well, you don't clear it. He's out of my way. I'm not even a sports voice of a stock for the, you're on this sports voice. That's correct. Now you're not going to start with sports. I'm just going to start with sports stock for an hour there. You're not going to do it. It's a good time. I'm not going to get into anything that's really that controversial. Yeah. I'm going to be a sports. You can be a part of fans. That's correct. But not for like five minutes for 30 years, okay? Time up. What are you talking to? Dad. Yeah, please, guys. He wasn't a man. He said, I'm sorry. I didn't. Which to the meds, what kind of a call is this to start? I'm a comes fan in a bud mail. I just want to congratulate you on a turn immediately from a good call or into a new fast. I don't want to do it. I got you. I got you going to do it. Yeah, you really do. You got my adrenaline going. Oh, good. I just didn't have a wonderful life. I got a lot of important calls here. I just did that. But I wanted to congratulate you. I wanted to be your Niagara caller. And remember me the gunner. Okay, sir. It's a pleasure. I said, yeah, lots of luck. And I hope you have a lot of fun on this station. Okay. Have a wonderful life. Okay. Those are the points. I'm going nuts. We've even got stem on my mobile phone. Hello. I'm going to run call. It's stem on on eight. Oh, stem is on eight. This is who? Well, as long as there's a voice there, that's all I care about how you do it. It's great. It's great to hear your voice again. The other is exciting. It takes me back almost two years. But you're going to have to when we're on AM on a real and, you know, in a real part of the day when people are awake and alive. And we get all these mobile callers and the people under the age of 100. It's frightening, isn't it, sir? I'm real happy for you. Now, they don't have to tell your house. Exactly. Are you going to try to get stem to job there? No. Well, I never thought I'd hear you on AM again. I'm going to glad to hear you. Okay. Well, have a wonderful day, sir. And thanks for your very perspicacious call. Now, what does this stem is on my mobile phone? The reason I want to get this quick is because I'm paying that car. Hello. Yeah. There he is on my car phone. Yeah. What's going on? Nothing wants to drive into work. Well, congratulations. It's about time. What? I said it's about time. It did something constructive with your life. Of course. Welcome to AM. Thank you so much. You know, I'm going to bring out the old stuff now or what? We've got some real good stuff coming up. In fact, we have some shockers coming later in the hours. So get your real-to-real going and whatever else. All right. Make sure somebody's listening, too. Okay. Get off my phone now. Will you please? All right. I'll go now. Bye. I'll take a break. I'll short that call. Exactly. Because I was paying for it. Okay. Just want to make sure I'm doing all these things. Right. This is pretty simple. You know what? It really is. Well, everything here. Well, now he's controlling him in there. Why are you having trouble hearing him? A little bit. Wait a minute. See, I can crank the monitor level up there. And the overhead you'll be able to hear him. All right. It's a little, uh, any other complaints? That's it. So far. Okay. All right. Now we're going to do break at 10. But this is exciting. You know, because everything is on the screen. This is almost like a real professional radio station. Instead of like having the log, you know, falling on the floor and in between the layers of pizza. He will use to happen is like you'd get all those layers of mong on the log and you couldn't read it anymore. You didn't know what spot was coming up. It was kind of exciting. Separate phone volume control. Yeah. I mean, like in here. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what you. Okay. Well, the work on this. Okay. Well, this is the first day. First hour. We're going to do a break now. Is this our first inaugural break on the new Roger show and WIOD? Okay. It's 10 10 on 6 10. WIOD. Hi. Okay. It's 10 14. And I'm going to play something here. The horrendous stuff. The quality is not what you call real exciting. But this is AM. Oh yeah. Well, I was driving down on 95 the other night. Somebody nearly cut me right off the road. How to sign it wasn't going to do any good to get man. So we're going to song about him instead. It goes like this. We're going to be more than asshole. Or did you work it your whole life? Either way it worked out fine. Cause you're an asshole tonight. Yes, you're an A. That's that. That's a totally. And don't keep trying to play me on me. You deserve all the credit. You're an asshole tonight. We're an asshole yesterday. You're an asshole tonight. You're an asshole tonight. The girl I've got to feel it. You're being asshole the rest of your life. And I was talking to you, your mother. Yes, the other night. I told her I passed your asshole. She said yes. I think you're right. And all your friends are asshole. As you know that you're whole life. Cause somebody told me you've got an asshole for life. Or you more than asshole. Or did you work it your whole life? Either way it worked out fine. Cause you're an asshole. And you're an asshole. It takes us back to those wonderful glory days. And then do something for you. The glory day. 10 17 on 6 10 W I O D. The Neo Roger show and of course Uncle Steve will be along the same to know. And I think the search and black's per bush which is really going to be exciting. So they said that bush is going to get about 15% of the black vote, which I think shows you how incompetent the dococus campaign is. I mean that's almost impossible. Okay, now one thing that I have a bad habit of doing I take these mobile colors ahead and I always pay for it. Hello. Yeah, so you mobile? No, not. Oh, I'm on the rock. Oh, that's a wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to be your first girl. That was on one. Now, my under wrong. That's your mistake. I mistake. Oh, you told him that you were mobile, huh? I don't know. Yeah, I did not. I bought, I bought, yeah. Okay. In other words, you just told a little fib to get on right away, right? Oh, okay. Go ahead. I know. I understand. I just wanted to be your first lady. Yeah, okay. You would be too trust me. In more ways than one. That is correct. Yeah, right. You try that up louder in here and here a bit. Okay. Now, wait a minute. Talk. Okay. Come on. Wait a minute. Maybe I'm doing something wrong. Oh, wait a minute. The telephone level there. Go ahead. All right. Oh, you're just going to have a home game. Get your buttons working. Okay. You just mind your own buttons. Okay. I'll take care of my buttons. And you were about yours. Okay. So what's going on? First of all, have you birthday? Thank you. It was a lot of fun. We had a very quiet day. And I want to thank Raynap at Rick oven Pizza for a little party for us. It was great. Great. Great. Loads of luck. Where you are right now. You can sleep in our later in the morning. Yeah, you know, that getting up at 430. That was hell. You need to get up at 6. Just to listen to you. Yeah. It was hell. That's right. I'm a lady. Go ahead. Wait a minute. I'm the girl that called you. Did you do anything about electrocuting your turn right? Yes. No. I didn't have any turn lights. It turned out we just like the wood. It's a whole long story. And I don't want to put the audience in a coma. No, okay. Well, let Mike talk about it tomorrow. Yeah. I heard that. I want to know what that is. Yeah. The next three picker. The point. I had to bring an accran to get that finger out of his nose. Yeah. That it was disgusting. This is play that music. Yeah. We're going to do. We got a lot of good stuff here. Didn't that bring back memories? Yeah. Of course. I'm better to. Yeah. Well, it was one. You got it. Well, listen, have a wonderful day. Our first Delady caller. And don't ever lie to my producer. I'm good. It's just a joke. Relax. Okay. Have a nice one. We got another break to do now. This is good. You realize something. We haven't done anything yet. No, no, no, no. And on his first day, Steve was right. There's like a honeymoon period. Yeah. And everybody. Oh, you're so wonderful. Yeah. All the butt likers are calling in. I want to. We don't want anybody over 100. Okay. We got to get rid of some of these old farts. It's called WIOD. We don't want them on this show. We want them to listen and sit back and relax. But we don't want to hear their voices because it's bad. It's bad for the sales department. It sounds like bad demographics. We want those young pinheads to come back. Don't we? Yeah. Except for the struggling lady. Oh, yeah. He's a lot. Any time. Okay. Now, let me give the numbers. All of the phones are going nuts here, bud. It would be nice if I gave the numbers. They'd count a 751 WIOD for Lauderdale and Broward 524WIOD. I feel like Sandy now. All these numbers got managed to listen to her. Give those numbers. Which is also good because that takes like a whole break. A Bokendell Ray 278 WIOD and a Palm Beach is 655 WIOD. It's 1021 on 610 WIOD. It's the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station. Okay, and they will. I'm sure that 1025 on 610 WIOD. Then you'll run your show. That brought a tear to my eye. That Steve came to me. It really did. Wasn't that a lot of BN motion? You know, when your full of it comes out, you say, it doesn't know that's the way we feel. Okay, let's say now you're sure this is a mobile. Right? Okay. Positive. Hello. Hey. It's now on a congratulatory. Where is Steve? He's absolutely my grandson. And I wanted to tell him not to be birthday. Oh, you got the quietest engine in your car that I've ever heard in my life, you know? Really? Can you blow your horn for us? Yes, two of your horn one time. Come on. Well, let's see. Give us a little tooth. A cookie. There you go. Yeah, that's it. Boy, I can't believe it. Well, listen, have a wonderful day. And don't ever call a show again. Okay. Before they are really giving you a line of BS today, aren't they? They're really giving a kiss. So don't ever say for sure. Say, so they say or something like that. Miami. Hello. I do know. Pretty good. Well, listen to these phones. This is great, isn't it? It is actually. Sound like you're in the same county almost to the same planet. No, I'm from Miami. Great. I was great here in your voice. You got to tell myself, corn, months, and just kneel just to hear your voice. Well, thank God for them. Maybe I should have stayed off another couple of weeks. Could have picked up murderous chains. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. We're glad to be here. That wasn't bad. And that was pretty good, you know. Oh, that was embellished. Yeah. When I called the place where you used to work, yeah, I was awakened. I was woken up and I called the station and I listened to a Dave in the Ford. Yeah. And I said, what happened? And he said, oh, well, they were driving the work and the spaceship took him off. I just really didn't know what happened. The spaceship? Yeah. Space ship. I like that. I had nothing to say. I understand. About that particular show. Really? But I'm glad to hear you. And I'd like to look. And I'd like to say by the way, thank you very much. You're great American. And we appreciate it. Thank you. Bye-bye. Now the bird. I want to admit that one thing I'm confused about. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I got to get, um, figure out where I am. Okay. All times. No, seriously. Because then when you punch the off, it's kind of stupid. If you punch the wrong bank. And then like, you hear that click like he hung up there. And it sounds like real bush league. Or used to that. A 1027 on W.I.O.D. Because I didn't expect on the first day. I really didn't know we'd have this confrontation. I thought that would take at least a few days. And then we do it our way. Okay. But when I'm telling you by the time we leave here, there won't be a scrap. It will never know that there was any food in here. Believe me. Sharon's worried. She's afraid she's going to gain all this weight with us here. And then she looks a little bit of macho. She could put on a couple of pounds. No, seriously. You could put on a couple of pounds. Nobody would ever know the difference. Now I do want to say this. Okay. Because we have a lot. See, there's so much insanity going on here. Because we've got all the phones ringing like crazy. It's that honeymoon period. A couple of weeks will be back up for calls. And then everybody is so enthusiastic in the building. And the food is coming in. And it's one of those things that happens on your first day back after that long rest. Which is very awesome for three days. Five. No, but that means three. Probably a three work days. One night. It was real nice. It was great. Although it seems to me that I was here for a couple of days. Wasn't I? You were here Friday. And I want to thank Steve. By the way, Steve was very cordial in friendly. We'll see how long that last. But he was. He was great. Yeah. And we'll whip him into shape. We'll get, you know, we'll get rid of the baseball card stuff. And I'll let boring crap that he's going to have it doing. And we'll force him to do a real show every day. Wow. Right. I mean, we're not doing one today. This is like this requires no effort whatsoever. Yeah. But we'll whip him into shape. And, you know, force him to be at his best. Which is when he's dangerous. But the thing that astonishes me is that there are people at the place where we used to work. Can we mention Zeta? See, I have to ask everything. There's one thing about Bill Y's here is our operations manager. No matter what I say to him, you know, and I clear everything with him. Okay. Everything. I should go, you know, is it okay if we do this or play it? Of course. What's wrong with that? As what he always says, every time he says that. Exactly. I mean, like when we played the George Carlin record in the next hour, you know, he's not going to have any problem with that. Just a joke Bill relax. You can say Zeta 4. Okay. So when you say Zeta 4, and we used to be there and we were there for you. And a lot of people are wondering, why would they take the number? Well, they didn't do anything because I went to them and I said, bye. Like Chef Crowley on it. Have you ever seen Chef Crowley who pedals the kitchen stuff on TV? And he goes, bye bye. Like that. Like him a little like that. And they said, boy, your wrist is a lot limber today than it was a year ago. And I said, that's for working for you people. Okay. Because you've intimidated you for a rest. You've hassled you. You've done everything it was to make us miserable as a reward for getting you these great numbers. Yeah. And what they tried to tell us, and I know people are not going to believe this. And we won't mention Tim's name because he's defensive. He has one. It doesn't want to be has. So we'll just say upper level managed good over there. Fine. It was brain dead. Okay. Is that a nice way to put it in that? And they came to me and they said, well, it's nice that you number one. But we wouldn't have rather have you been number three. And I said, I don't know how to be number three. How to help you be number three. Okay. And they said as far as creativity is concerned, forget it. Yeah, we don't want any. We just don't want it. We just want a nice save showing. That's what they've got. Okay. So we're going to do in ones. It's nice and it's safe. And they've taken an AM and they've gone back to that all news format, which was a terminal loser about three years ago. Remember, it was why they changed it. And they blew out Stan and Jay and everything else. They're all of the talk virtually. And they put the all news back, which has the oldest demographic of any format in a country number one. And number two, it's failed here. Yeah. But it was very successful years ago. And then it just ran out of gas. But you know, market for. You got it, myth. They got that tree doctor. The tree doctor is tough. You're like, in fact, if Ernie is listening this morning, you'd go get me up against that tree surgeon. Oh, you got it. He got it. And he made me. Trust me, that whole place is out of the limits. But the amazing thing. And you're going to be surprised to hear me say this because I know you're a venomous person. But no, seriously. I don't have any hostile feelings. It's like I'm so relieved to be out of there. And away from those doodle birds. I just don't, I'm numb. You know what I'm saying? I thought after we left, I thought I was going to be just come on here and attack them and rip and tear and go crazy. And I just don't have the feeling to do it because I'm just, I just am numb. I guess that's the best way to put it. I'm almost at the loss for work. Well, do you remember what I said to you when I left? I said the last day we realized that there's absolutely no need to wish them anything bad. Well, we don't have that. Well, we don't have that. Because you're going to take care of it. They'll all take care of it. So you're going to do a real good. We wish them all the best. We do. Well, we don't wish them to take a bad all the best because day did a great job with us and he's a good guy and we still consider him a friend and all of that all though. But anyway, he has he's a great guy and he did a lot of creative stuff for us and I wish him the best. But again, they haven't told him much either from what he tells me really. I don't want to put him in a precarious position. But they're just like kind of playing at fast and loose like maybe you'll be on and maybe you won't. And we're conducting a nationwide search. Those nationwide searches that they conduct over there, man. They produce them in a most incredible. And the history like that moring zoo. Do you remember that? I remember that. I remember that. I remember that zoo never saw such a bunch of bird brains as that. I think they were in the field play and off. That was incredible. So anyway, we're not going to mention the name of the upper level. You know, it's amazing that they've got the goal. They've got the goal. They've got the goal to be calling here and telling us not to talk about. Man, it's like they think we're still working there. Yeah. Have you ever heard anything like that in your life? Well, they're trying, I guess. But they're still trying to intimidate us into hassle. And they're still lost and give us a rough time and they can go to hell. They can go to hell is what they can do as far as I'm concerned because they tried. It was like crap. Like garbage. Like subhuman mong is how they treated us and they just couldn't handle the success. Remember back on AM my slogan to describe their philosophy. Mess with success. Well, some people can't. They can never handle the successful day parts. They've always got a medal with them. And the other parts where they're doing ones. I don't want to mention any specific individuals over there. But the parts of the day were they're doing like ones in a 1.2, which is like not even being on the air almost. Hey, they love those people. Because they don't make any waves and they don't see anything and there's no controversy. And that's what it's all about. I still wonder what that mystery picker was all about. I wrote even wrote that down, which I really write any little notes or anything. But the mystery picker when Reneri kept saying that over and over. And I thought boy, we really got him nailed into a corner. No one. This is good. Now I've heard you packers listening and this is a little inside thing. And he is. By the way, font size, the group that did the boys want sex in the morning and the penis envy and the other things. And we, I don't have them. I really don't. And we'd like some nice virgin copies if you find the expression of that material. And I'm sure that rich packers, the guy who's got it. Okay, I'm positive that he's going to have that stuff. Or he'll know where we can get it. And he is listening. And if he doesn't come up with the next couple of days, we're going to rip the crap out. All right. Let me take a quick corner because I'm sitting here rambling. And we ought to go to homestead. Hello. How do you know? I do in Bud. Yeah. I bird how you're doing. Hey, listen, you're going to have a field day in the parking lot here. Have manners of Julian cars. You can rip off more stuff here in one day than you put in a year at the other place. I'll go to congratulate you on moving because it's a much bigger parking lot. Spencer and I over a week and had a few drinks. We're talking about how clean him and off the island. All right. Now you're talking about. But we need to get a hold of Spencer. Do they have a, a way to have. Do they have a car washing here? Is there a place that comes around to wash as the cars here? Well, they do. Oh, channel seven has a lot of one to go over there. The far real out to go over there. Channel seven. You know, when we had the press conference here at last week, Did they make in? You remember we had the press conference last Tuesday and channel seven didn't show up because they figured it was too far. Yeah, it's a long way. It was a hell of a long truck for them. So what's going on, Hannah? What I really like to know is he's at Pomona Square in the last 10. Oh, that's a little Johnny Palo. You know that two foot magic. Come on. A serious, come on, Hap. All right. Well, I want to congratulate happy birthday Neil. I'm glad you people were back. Okay. Well, I have the security looking for you. Happy birthday. Bye. Well, it's a great call. I'm happy. 1035 on 610 Wild and I want to thank Rain Ampugin and nice people at the brick oven. Pits a rear as Ernie would say for our nice little party that we had on the Saturday night. Oh, you know, that's another thing Steve was saying the other day that they a time to live spots. They have to be exactly sick. Well, they can whistle a dark tune on that. It's not seriously. You know, whatever it is, it is. But anyway, brick oven has been with us for a long time and they've been voted to number one pizza two years in row by soft for a magazine. The pizza is great. That's great salad that they bring the Eddie Pasto salad on the pizza crust. Garlic slices with cheese. I never even knew they had those. And they were out of this world, of course. And they have that lunch and special that they serve every day to four for just 295. You get a garden salad. The slice of pizza, garlic bread and a soft drink for only 295. So the prices are very, very modest. The baked ZD by the ways out of this world. We dive into about 15 pounds of that. And we invite you to stop by anytime for a quick and a great lunch or dinner at brick oven pizza. It's unique. It's totally different. And it's delicious. What more can you ask for that? Well, you can get the big meal. And the big meal or the bigger. Bigger. Which is really full of baloney. The bigger. It's all waiting for you to brick oven. Patriot is 7100 Hollywood Boulevard in Pembroke Pines. Okay. It's 1039 to WION. Today I screwed up by the way. I'd supposed to do a little intro for the news there and Henry Burrell. And Henry being the pro that he is. He threw something through the window. He made me know. He's a great guy. He looks incredible, doesn't he? Yeah. He's been in the past. How much did he say? 37 or 55, and he looks so incredible amount. And he really looks good. Anyway, we're going to take some calls now for serious because we've been doddling around. A lot of you have waited. We've been lost a couple of people, which I get very agitated about that. But I do want to say this. If you call and you tell my producer that you're on a mobile phone, we're not going to believe it anymore anyway. Okay. Even if you're in the middle of traffic, if you're lying on a highway. And we hear sounds of like mufflers. We're not going to believe it anymore because we just been let down a pant too many times. Okay. Alright, Hollywood. Hello. Hollywood is gone. I hear that disgusting sound. Kendall. Hi. Mr. Rogers. Yes. I am so glad to hear you and I am a, I am a, I am a guest. Wow. I can't believe this. This sounds like a familiar voice. Yes. And most of all, I want to wish you had to vote the Ellen's reminiscing about eight years ago. Yeah. And you have no idea what you really have done to come on this nation. WRB should consider that more important to get number one that this folks so hope. Well, you can say that again. I agree with you wholeheartedly. If you don't tell them that, well, I came in as morning. I said, you folks are so damn fortunate. You have no idea. And they said, well, we'll see. Okay. Now, and listen, you don't have to say anything but anyone because you have a talent. Can you have intelligence, educate people they can. You have been doing for last eight years. I sure have. And I feel that you don't have to stoop down to the level because they lost what they had the best. That is correct. Myself, I like to thank you for all the help that you have given us in last eight years. And I also like to thank you for playing in same song. Yeah. And if you're fits in this town, doesn't it? Yeah. And if you have any idea that they're starting to stop you from doing it, then he's doing something wrong because you're not doing anything illegal. It doesn't want to listen to that. He can drive his radio. Well, that's true of anybody. Anybody doesn't want to like what we're doing. It doesn't want to listen. They can go whistle in a dark place. Okay. Have a wonderful day. And moving right along to see now. I'm torn because I see veggie is on there in Boca. Oh, and we haven't taken a Boca long. But I'm going to take him out of order because I'm so excited to see his name on a screen. Veggie. Hey, are you doing the old? Pretty good. What's up, pal? Oh, my son. Just be well. I just can't believe it there. Yeah, I can't either. You know, that's a real radio station and the people there have been really nice to us. And we'll see how long that lasts, okay? Yeah, or this is what I'm doing. I'm really happy that he switched because number one, I don't have to deal with the operators for the correct call. Right. Yeah, we got a Boca line. We got a Palm Beach line like a real radio station. Okay? Unbelievable. Unbelievable is right. I just realized that just beginning to sink in. You know? Right there. You know, I get your whole show now. I don't have to only catch the last half of that. Yeah, my audience, you know, we did real good numbers in the morning. We had great demographics. Although they were the wrong ones. But the morning drive was just not our crowd. Okay. They weren't awake yet and they just couldn't call. It was fun. But, uh, too early. And plus, you know, I just noticed, you know, I even have to deal with the right anymore. Really? What do you mean by that? I don't think you have a good breakfast. Yes. Oh, yeah, we do. Wrong. Don't worry. Trust me, Veggie. Yeah. Back there. Soon as we punched you up, he started glowing a little for wrestling. You know what I'm saying? It's an alley problem. It's not going on. Now it's going like blinking, practically, that it hears your edge there. Trust me. Okay. Okay. All right. So listen, uh, the alerts. Nice talk and see it. And have a great life. Yeah, you should. I'm glad I told you that you don't have button there. Now listen, I want to know that the lay has been on all along. Trust me, because I can when we go into the break, I hear it post a post a quarter or whatever they have. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't. I don't think so. I don't. Why? Now you are. Do we have been on delay? What are you getting all been out of shape? Well, they come out of delay to do that. Yeah, we come out of delay. We're in because Henry, you can't relate to that kind of stuff. Okay. Okay, Henry's whole life has been in delay. So he's not going to listen. Okay. Listen, have a great day. Yeah, you can. Oh, bye. No, he's a great guy. Really is. It was amazing. Like old home week when we walked in here last two day, but I press conference because I look around here all these people that I've worked with over the years. In fact, it looked like we're just coming back to a people who escaped from a concentration camp or something. I was like to said that to get earnings a tie now. I know. It was so weird because I was walking down the hall Tuesday and they came up to me and they said, Glenn, this is Rick Weaver. And I went, wow. Mr. Weaver. He's a. Weaver. Mr. And after yesterday's game, I would stay away from a few days. Good idea. They just can't do anything in New England. You know, it must be something about the air up there or the atmosphere. They just stink up there. Well, I can't say that, okay. They really do their pathetic when they play up there. But that's where it goes. Okay, 1044 Wild and one thing that I must say I'm proud of. It doesn't mean a lot. But when I leave a station, even when we went from AM to FM, I don't have any problem given a right call at us. That's right. I don't know why that is. I never made a mistake. And I remember one night, this is a true story. One night, I was a W. News years ago. And I said, it's 1025 at WBTA. And I don't know where that came from from the TV in the horror. Or I worked like 25 years ago. And I said, WBTA. And it just slipped out. It poured it out. That's weird. You sure you didn't dream that. Well, I probably was thinking about the TV downs or something like that. Okay, now we got a lot of stuff that we have to play today because it is the first day. And I want you to understand that there are a whole group of people. It's like work. I think tested today. Right. There are a whole group of people out there not near Rogers listeners. And I heard those people calling Steve last week who allegedly never listen to my show and have no idea who I am alleged. And they're going to give us a chance this morning. Okay? Yeah, I heard that too. I'm going to listen once in a video like it. You know, that got stuff. But Sandy, you know, we're Sandy. But Sandy, you're going to be, you know, we're going to be all alone. Sandy is all alone. Right now, as we speak. Okay, where we go next to coconut. Am I doing this wrong? Because I have a feeling. I have a feeling that I keep going to line one over and over and over again. I just, I don't know why. We did bokeh for the first time. I took the veggie out of order. Yeah. Oh, Cooper City on four. We got to get that on. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. What's up? How you doing? How come you're not? How old are you, sir? I'm 19. And you're not in school or working today? No, I got a school. I got a BC thing. Oh, you go to BC. See, now you're talking. I call it a few weeks ago to bring your breakfast, remember? Yeah. And what happened? Well, it's like Thanksgiving. I'm going to bring it. Oh, never he called us and gave us two months. Well, that's right. Yes, good to get this notice. And of course, by Thanksgiving, we'll have their resistance worn down here. You won't have to worry about bringing food in, okay? I can still bring it in. Absolutely. That's good. I just found the old building and you changed space. You know, we're like the next day. That is correct. Where is this place? Where are we? Yeah. Now, where are you? We're in Cooper City. Yeah. Well, that's not far from you now. We're in the 79 Street Coswin North Bay Village. You know where that is? Are you familiar with Miami? Right next to Channel 7. Right next to Channel 7. Oh, I know. In fact, all the former employees of Channel 7 were lined up out there, picketing this morning when I came to work. We're excited. Just a joke. Don't get up tight over there. Channel 7, Bob Soper won't even come over here and do the weather. Now, do I get to meet Bob Soper, by the way? Yes, so he'll probably be in here any minute. This is great. No. Back on the phone. Oh, he does all of those on the phone. Are you sure? He just hangs out with the net. It's a good line because it sounds like he's right here in the building when he comes in. And he says, I might get your finger on it there. I'm sure that he's sitting right there looking at him. You've got to be kidding me. So what do you think, Pat? What is your first name, by the way? So we have like a handle on you. Marshall. Marshall? Yeah. We don't usually do names on a show, but in your case, we'll make an exception. Okay. I feel honored. You do. You should be honored. Okay. And we'll be looking for that breakfast. Okay. Nothing that not like McDonald's or anything. Okay. Now I'm going to be home quick. All right. Fine. That's fine. Okay. Well, let the Reneri tasted first. See how it is. Okay. Okay. Thanks a lot. Take it easy. Bye. Well, that was incredible, wasn't it? Hmm. See, my problem is I'm not reading any of the stuff you're typing on the screen. That's a problem. Well, I'm kind of independent. You know what they say. We just do our own thing and to help with everybody else. I am so tempted to play that that 2D fruity Alice. Wow. I don't, I don't think it'll back us up. It's 2.5 minutes long. Yeah. And on the first day, I want to make sure we hit the breaks on time. We do it. So they get a false sense of security. Like we're going to do things on time. Well, I'd like it closer to a clock. We will do it. It's top of the hour news on time. We will do that. Yeah. But other than that, can you believe that not let me do the news here? It is shocking. I said it is. Because you did said kind of a new trend for news in the market. In fact, I heard you said it this morning talking over music, fumbling through the news. I don't imagine anything. Maybe it was shocking. Well, the original is always the best. And I do want to say this because man, man is so defensive. Peter bulge your better known as Rose is a great guy. He thinks I'm going to rip him over here or not. I have no reason to rip him. He's tasted music as suspect. But other than that, he's a good guy. We got a lot of great 90% of the time. And he treated me very fairly. And he and I kind of had it all worked out that we were going to leave in a nice way. And then of course, others, we don't want to mention any names, kind of let the cat out of the bag. It became, you know, imminent that we just had to get the hell out of there. Yeah. To protect all concern. But I have not, I have no bad feelings about him. And he's so damn defensive. I told him that. Now, his music, that's another story. And at the so-called classic crock that they play over there, that's, what can I say? It's about a one three, whether we're there, whether we're not there, one three, one five, somewhere in there. And you just can't win with a one three. No. Oh, wants to talk to the pig. Let's get that call on right away. Hello. Yes. Is it real? Yes. I can't believe the way you abuse people. I know. It's terrible, isn't it? It certainly is. I do think that you're at a decent station, as you say. You're calling this a decent station. The first day you went to INZ, you said the same thing about them. They were a decent station. The first day I went there, that's correct. But you don't have a decent thing to say about anybody. Which, of course, leads us to ask the one logical question. You know what the question is? I have many ideas. Why? Why? Well, it seems to me, since you listened to Diane's, even though briefly, obviously. Right. And you probably listened on Zeta, although probably, you never listened on Zeta. And now you're listening here today, you know. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Don't don't get hyper. You didn't even hear Alan. And you were gone. Oh, I see. So in other words, instead of, what, turning the dial once you had the radio accident, you felt compelled to call and chew me out. Well, really, I wanted to speak to someone who has charge of the off. Oh, so in other words, you didn't want to speak to me. Right. Good. Okay. Oh, they're healthy. She's going to be out there every day, getting sexual excitement from the side of my voice. You're not full on anybody, okay? And we don't really want to talk to old bags like you, anyhow. And I think you should turn your radio down a bit. I think you made disturb your neighbors. Yeah. She's got it up so loud. Well, she's getting those good vibrations, okay? Even Brian Wilson never talked about vibrations like those. Okay. We're going to take our break on time, because we want to be really on our best behavior on the first day. Yeah. It's a good time. We feel like it. It's 10.51 on 6.10 WIOD. It's a good time for the great taste. Neil, this is noodles. Reminding you that it's always a good time for the great taste. You have to be good to get to a old friend's voice back on here. Now did the laugh make it over? The bird laugh? My laugh? Yeah. That did make it over. Oh, it's on a table. I haven't dubbed it yet. Oh, is that okay? Well, it's just I saw it. I spent hours and I want to think about the way it was here yesterday for hours and hours. A super guy helping me figure that little room out and dumping all the stuff just incredible. Just like the other place, you know. All that help from the engineers. Anyway, it's 10.55 on 6.10 WIOD. Let's get in some calls here. We've got a former cranker from the Gable. Hello. Yeah. When I told Binky of the switch, I had to tell you he was so excited to crack all over his cage. Binky. Paul Harvey. Yeah. Can't believe this. I'm going to show you how to do the thing. Oh, I guess I couldn't get away with it. Are you going to straighten yourself on? I was always trying to tell us. I'm going to go by my real name. Wow. So it's like performed now. Wow. I'm going to try not to think all over you. It's nice hearing from easy keel. They call them Zique for sure. Zique. But happy birthday. I guess you're birthday was Saturday, right? Thank you so much. Yeah. I was really, really nice one and quiet. And thanks for all the cards and that stuff. And congratulations. It's just so weird. It's going to take some getting used to because I'll have to. I'll, uh, you know, I felt guilty every time I call I have to. From all the grief he used to give me. Yeah. I think that's when you started turning on me. Yeah. When you started calling this station, that's when I turned on you. Now when you start calling Zeta again, you're going to be really up a creek without a. Without a nose to pick. I can agree that will not happen. Do you know who the mystery picker is by any chance sir? I don't know how that keeps bugging me. But it seems like strange that we're near. It's like, first he starts and do Spag last week. Yeah. When he only in here and now he's doing the mystery picker. The only thing that I can think of didn't he and Sandy work together for a while. They sure a long time. Yeah. Yeah. Is she the mystery picker? Sandy. What if he's something if Sandy turned out to be the mystery picker? No, what if this here's Johnny G. Oh, I would have peaked. Yeah. Well, what's your name from the beat? Oh, a jack from the beat. Jack, well, you tell all lovely lady. Yeah. I've never heard of, but you think you'll call your show? I sure hope not. Hmm. Well, it's been a leak. Yeah. Well, it's still. And I know. Yeah. That's something. That's the real name. Greg said you called you by first name this morning so I was really excited. What? What did he say? I went to the library. Whatever. I just caught the end of it. Something about a meal of the excited to hear that. Let me just say something to the entire audience. Okay. We were talking about this during a break. When we were on AM a year and a half ago, the FM people were all sending us material and doing bits for us. And a love does. And they'd tickling all over us. Then when we went on against him and beat the crap out of them, then all of a sudden we were bad guys. We were the enemy and they make it all these nasty comments. Now we're back on AM with a good guy. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. Good evening. No, sure. I never stole a freight train at his correct. I wasn't sure. I have a wonderful day. I'm really, really, really, really, really, really. Yeah. What are we going to hear from Ed? Oh, I've forgotten about Ed. Listen, I have untaved not that Ed. But do you remember the other Ed? Yeah, there wasn't another Ed. The Ed went on for hours and hours threatening to do the bits that we had on a cassette that I played. Remember all of a sudden? Yeah. We have the cassette. Got it. I feel that Ed's going to make it come back. Listen, have a wonderful day in the Coliseum again in a couple of months. Okay. Like around like around you, who is? I think you guys have really brought up the sales. We're depend on the government because we're so excited to do that. Okay. And I'm sure that some of the management people are doing the same thing. Bye bye. Okay. And then nothing when you found his name out, Phil, amazing. And all this right on. Now, Johnny, Jesus here. We want to thank you profusely and you realize now you guys are responsible. There's food in the studio. And I see we have an open eats and treats. We thank him very much. The pizza, however, will get open. So I don't know how we're going to do this. But we do have a lot of newspapers and we'll make sure to cover everything. Oh, yeah. We've got napkins here. Which doesn't have an nervous breakdown. Ed, they'll be mine. People don't start getting hostile in everything. Yeah. Yeah. That's great. What do we got here? We have the gourmet deluxe. Cormet deluxe. Yeah. And by the way, brain app is listing. We've got great, great, things you got great pizza by the way. Okay. Great. Break oven. You're not going to have to. Headed with the right. I don't know where it delivery up. You're a delivery thing. You're in a totally different area. We're not a sit down. That's right. And he also thinks Flores has great pizza. Which also is not a competitor with you because it's in a different area. Okay. It's right up the street here. You know, gourmet special. Right. Which is a sundry tomato. Right. Okay. Thanks a million. You're having a class at this. Well, for a long time, you bet. Okay. Thanks a lot. We got to get out of here. Make way for the news coming up at the top of the yard. And we'll come back and really do some stuff. Okay. We really take some good crank calls and some of the people that found us by accident on 610 WIOD. WIOD. Right. And the fourth one. We're here. Tom Todd with Steve K. The Saturday 2 on news. You hear that? Did you close that pot? Is that cart blank? That's incredible. Anyway, it's 11.05 on 610 WIOD. That cart pot is that open? Wait a minute. Let's try this one. Yeah. Get my regards to the Neil Rogers. Tell him that I've never heard of a smother your program in my life. Okay. That other one is either unqueued or somebody bulked it as that possible. A little sabotage there. Okay. Listen, what we're going to do. And we don't want to eat on here because it's disgusting and grow test. And we thank Johnny G's and we have eaten just a little bit during the news. Okay. And we don't. We don't want to make gutterless sounds on here. Okay. Oh, God is that good. Want some pizza there? No. You can't handle it. What? Oh, he's got something with his teeth. Like when he eats, they fall out or something like that. But anyway, we're going to invite because we don't want to really, we bent the rule just a little bit. We know they're having a nervous breakdown all over the building. But we went, want to invite some of the people in the building who may be listening. There are two incredible pies from Johnny G's. And if you folks will come in here and get them on here, then there won't be any traces left. Okay. No, seriously. Because we've eaten all we need during the news. And if somebody will come in and get these and take them into the cafeteria and then it will be clean and the rumble clear out of here before King gets here. What are you laughing about that? They take this very seriously. May that alone us? Really, really? No. He'll just eat the leftovers. Okay. But you want to take these into the cafeteria? So we get the evidence. And you have fun to weigh down or to because it's really good. Okay. Okay. We have a car phone. I was just legit. This is legit. Hello. That's what they all say. Mobile. Yes, sir. This is what you're bound to. I'm heading down. Sequest full of art and boing beats. Boy. I'm out of plastic and got a wish you and the bird. The best. The luck. I'm out of plastic.

Just to just Wild, D Miami, 33141. Okay. Oh, here's one from inside. And it says, if you ever eat in that studio, again, oh, my God, from John Harper, are you serial and W snooze? They're upset. About what? You, will you read that? I don't. Wouldn't dare read that. You're then incredible. That's incredible. Frightening. Oh, oh, my God. And, cow and no, from Jack. You know, wait a minute. Is this a joke? Somebody has sent us. Listen, this is a major coup, which we'll do after the break. Uh, well, the break isn't until 12. Great. Oh, we got time. Seriously, somebody sent us a yummy of a memo. This is like a little CIA work. Something here. And it's all the enicle of this, because you work there, right? And W snooze and every five memories of that place. It says to all on air talent from Johnny Harper, The New Rogers and W I O D. Yeah. Should I read it? Well, of course. Well, I just wanted a little encouragement because everybody is Salivating at the mouth. Cool. Needless to say, the situation involving the Rogers Joining W I O D is very disturbing to us all. Oh, by laughing. Oh, sorry. He gets paid by the cackle, by the way. So if you wonder why he gets so carried away, it will be necessary for our on air to be out of the world. So if you're going to be ready for our on air talent to make certain changes in our programming in order to combat this unfortunate situation. Oh, we're so dramatic organs. It's very serious. By the way, thank you, Janet Cowen, some of you nice know that. I'm a team of the engineer and I thank her for welcoming us. Anyway, this goes on. Sandy. And as much as you are on opposite Neil, you must do more creative counter programming to attract listeners who dislike Neil. Doesn't he understand the listeners who dislike Neil? The ones who are here every day. John, John was my first board up when I came to town here at KAT. He was my board up. And now he's like the, what does he? Like the chief CEO of Jefferson pilot or something. I mean, the man is incredible. At least once a week, you should have a cooking show and invite college to share favorite recipes. That'll do this would not be a restaurant show. The gardening show would also be of interest. Did do a show about color rectal cancer. See, this is all. This is all a big joke. Okay, it's all a put on. It's good, though. Although, you know what I'm worried about? I think it may be. He's a little. I'm not so sure it's a put on. Ow, you must be more aggressive opposite Steve. Our consultants say that political discussions are popular. You should have more local politicians on daddy. For sales offices indicated he's willing to be a semi regular guest. You should also try to get more sports oriented. Talk up the heat. Maybe you can get some dog trainers on. Oh, no. Yes. Debbie, you should, I got it. Let's take the break. I want to be on time. You're going to love the one for Debbie Ellis. When you hear this, it's going to make you your teeth. He'll immediately like, oh, I got past 11 on 610 WIOD. Okay, 11 15 on 610 WIOD. Then he'll run your show. I feel like I'm talking about like it's 78 RPM. Calm down. No, it's, but we got so much to get in. I don't know. We can't get it all in today. And then Kane's going to come in at two and kick us out of here and we just got all enough stuff to get in. Is it okay if I eat while we, uh, yes. Absolutely. That'll make the people feel right at home. Anyway, it continues. It says Debbie, you should just blow your brains out on the air. We could promo this for several weeks. This could bring over some of Rick Weaver's listeners. Before you do this, however, please arrange a smooth transition with Joey Reynolds. He'll be replacing it. Oh, geez. I got a, oh, come on now. Where is it? Hmm. There it is. That's good. One, just like all times. And you know something I have a surprise for you. This is the extended version. Okay, let's go. Listen. You're going to freak out just wait a while. Here we go. There we go. There we go. There's a lot of fun. Yeah. I got an honor. Isn't that great? He's a talented dude. Fort stock at six. Okay, that's enough. Anyway, the last sentence says if we all pull together on this, we can severely damage WIOD's recent moves. Better yet. Let's just shut down the transmitter. What a comedian I've done, Harper. Isn't he a panic? That's what he's doing. That's a funny thing I've read in a long time, John. We don't know who my life paycheck is. We don't know who's responsible, but it was very, yeah, thanks very much. Okay, it's 11, 18 on WIOD, boy. Why? Almost. Boy, I just got a little, where are we? Okay. Hopefully not there. Coconut Grove. Hello, how are you? Great birthday first. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you. Good listener from the Grove. Cheese. I've been on here since dry. Just heard the most horrific news from Henry at 10 30 this morning when it came on with a sound bite for the lead on for the news. Was that about the bodies on the causeway? He said two pull a bit. He has exactly what he said. Two bullet riddle bodies were found alongside the Julia's. Total. Total causeway. Yeah, the guy's shocked. He said Mike the Carcass and George Bush. Yeah.

This is rookie job. Could have gave me just a ticket and say, you know, going down the road. But it's telling me that they can took me in all this kind of stuff. Yeah. So, make long story short. May I want or what? No, go ahead, sir. I'm just confused. I've got no idea what to happen. Long story short. It's police with a guy who is through. Hello. Go ahead, sir.

They're going to get his own car. You know that one car you got with KCK. It's coming up. Yeah. KCK. That's coming up. It's all coming up. If you'd ever get off the phone, sir, it's all coming up. Okay. Okay. But have a good day. Bye. Did he say KC's coming up? KC K. Oh, that's what he just said. Red sky was incredible. I had to put him away for at least a couple of months. Okay. It's 11 24 at 610 WIOD. Repreased. What's getting hard doing tonight? And crying minds want to know. That's why inspiring minds lead to Miami Herald.

Available at supermarket checkout counters everywhere. And we're final manure is friend. Okay. It's 11 28 on 610 WIOD. Now can you hear that? No. You can't hear it. Oh, what's it? The Miami Herald. If you were in cans, you could hear it. Yeah. I don't want to hear it. Oh, you got cans. No, no, that's alright. If you don't want to. Oh, I didn't know you had it. No, I don't want you to hear it. If you don't want them, don't wear them. I like not. This is like the old days. Yeah, yeah. Well, in fact, I'll take them off too then I can't hear anything. Yeah. We want to thank Alex Schreer and Tony Romans by the way. They've sent over just unions of ribs and stuff like that. You're going to have some ribs, Nick? No. He doesn't eat. Okay. I mean, are we in with a wrong crowd or what? I get the feeling that all of people here are on these massive diets, or they just don't eat or they're anorexic or something like that. To be say something. He says, I don't eat. Are we just need red meat? Oh, that's excellent. Good thinking. All of those ribs are delicious. I don't know. I can't. Okay. How about the cake? Can he cake? He said, yeah. He said, it'll come in and clean out the stuff. Whatever's left for meats and treats. Yeah. Cookies and stuff. Okay. Now, were you listening to Reneri this morning? Can you tell us who the mystery picker is by the chance? Does he know the answer to that? Okay. He's going to give me an answer on here too. This is frightening. Hank Goldberg. Oh, he's hanging. He takes a picture. He takes the football team. He said, they're going to win. That's what it is. So Hank is a classic picker. Yeah. The mystery picker. That's what it is. Okay. Let's go to four-laterdina. I've got to do this right. I'm going to freak out. It says, line six. Hello. Oh, it's me. I've been on for an hour. But I'm going to show you in four-laterdina. I did one right. Thank you. You got it. Hey, Neil. How's it been? Great. I tell you this is fantastic. We get you back over here. We're not even just getting on him. It's great. Back on him. I called you the last day of the show when you're on him. About a year ago. He gave you the report on a couple of things. We talked about odds with him. Yeah. We talked about Breck. I've had a lot of odds with him. I've been doing a lot of Brecky on the meantime. That's correct. I figured you had that. Especially over there at Zeta 4. That was hard on you. And it wasn't right either. I could feel it. I can hear it in the way you spoke and the way you said it. Well, we'll say this to you. For a few months, we had a lot of fun. We were loose. We had a good time. And then they started the people up there in Portland, and started back and done on everything. And blah, blah, blah, blah. You can't do this. You can't say that. And it just, no matter what the hell we did. You couldn't say, hello, he couldn't say goodbye. And if we play a funny bit on the air right away, the next day, somebody from Portland would come in and time to hear it. And you got to pull it out. And you can't do this. And you can't talk about sex. And by the time we got through, there was nothing. There were mornings. We would sit there and look at each other. I wonder, what the hell are we going to talk about? You know, they've taken everything else away. Right. And we were still kicking everybody's butt. Yeah. Well, that's that's that you that you can't mess with success. Because you guys are the best, you know. Well, I'm still happy to know that the old birds in there. How you doing here? He's sitting here. Glad to be here. Can you believe they won't let me do the news here, sir? You know, I heard that earlier when I was listening, I said, I'm not going to be the same newscast. You know, we're going to teach you a Henry and April to do, you know, eat while doing the news a little bit. To make some better, well, sounds and mess up the names in Brian. It'll be just the same. Good. I want to, I always throw this in every time you go to a new station. I always have to bring this up. And one of them is my wife, lift town with a banana. Yeah. I know that would work on this WIOD for the people that would enjoy that. And the second thing I want to ask you, as far as, I don't know you can't tell us what you're going to be making. But, uh, no, I don't discuss now. I know that. Because it gets a lot of people really upset. Right. But if we looked at this simply looked at numbers and say in the long run, obviously your numbers are going to be a bit higher than Cains. And if we judge the number at what his point is, or what he makes, that we kind of have the same ball part. And I don't discuss it at all. Okay. It's really bushly in the one here. Tell people what you're making. No. I get into a big thing about him. Let me just put it this way. Okay. They made me an offer that I would have had to be out of my mind to refuse. That's good enough. That's an extra question. That takes care of you. That's all matters. Because you're number one. You've got to. I'm going to get out of here. But I just wanted to call and say, excellent show. And see what you can do about my wife lift town with a banana. Okay. Have a great day. Talk to you, man. Bye-bye. Okay. No. I don't have that on carton here yet. We do have it. After about four hours yesterday. I said to Mitch, I think I'm going to like pack up the stuff and call it a day and you know put the rest of the stuff away. But look at that carousel. It's already filling up. Yeah. It's cute carousel too, by the way. It's really cute little carousel. Thanks a lot, Mitch. For the cute little carousel. I like it. And another thing we're going to have to have. Jay America. And a lot of those other people, the four listeners. Uh huh. And who were they got the guys? It did the whole bunch of stuff they did. Bye-bye. Yeah. As I've gotten here by the way. Oh good. That's some Miami City cops I believe. You have what they had a name. Yes, they did have a name. KJ and the losers. Exactly. We're going to have to have them do a lot of stuff for us because obviously we don't we can't use the ACM material. You believe I can't we have no intent. I really can't. I have a lot of long crap. Long term. I can't j in the losers. Okay, we have a spy report in Palm Beach. Hello. Oh. Now I know it's you because I punched up the one that says Palm Beach and if you're not in Palm Beach, man, I'm giving up right now. All right. Palm Beach. Yeah. Hey. Got to be worth a great show. Thank you. I got about 45 seconds. Okay. Last week, Thursday. Alice was babbling on about the election and the negative campaigning and all of a sudden that a clear blue sky. He says I'm putting Rogers on notice. Yeah. I heard about that. What does that mean? Yeah. He said he's put Rogers on notice and I'm not going to put up with this stuff this time. Okay. Well, listen, I'm glad you inspired me because right after the news break got something special for Alice. Okay. Right. Frost me. Do it. Okay. I want to say you two. Yeah. Told you to hold this. I knew it would work out. I knew it would work out. Good time out perfectly. Okay. April 4th. I'm going to W. W. W. We'll do news update and we'll come back at 11. 34. Okay. Now you think Alice is going to be upset about that? Ha ha. I mean, what is that about putting us on notice? What does that mean? I notice for what? He's like going to take it anymore. He's not going to take it anymore. Not going to take it anymore. What? Now, the last time that I was on a midday, Alice was also on a midday and I had a nine and he had a two five or something like that in the ratings and then he ran off into the afternoon. And I will say this. He did pick up a lot of stands audience once a major went off the air. But he's got those ancient demographics. Okay. That's a problem that whole station. Ancient demographics. Well, what is he worried about? I saw on the program schedule that Kane is going to have Jack Sturty in here in a week or two. Well, we can ask Jack Sturty about it. See what the story is. Okay. All right. So I'm 41 at Wild. The New Year Roger show here on a Monday. We're just delighted. We want to thank Tony Romas and Johnny G's and the E.C. Three and God only knows what else. Now that Palm Beach line is not live. Is it? Is it out? Now that's embarrassing. Okay. We're all a people we used to have from Palm Beach who would call and have to pay for it and show us not because we never Palm Beach line. Now we're into a 55 Wild. I get very anxious. There are all lines on it. And Paul E lines are on the athletic. It's it. We're into aesthetics. We like it to look good. We don't care who's on there. Exactly. We probably won't even talk to him. Okay. But we want somebody on a damn line. All right. Okay. Now let's go to Fort Lauderdale on six. I don't know how it is when I punch one up. It's not the one that I punch. This is exciting. Over and over again. Okay. I think they're having a little fun with us in there. I think they're like twisting them around like, what does that show with Link Martin Dale? Where they do is a TikTok dough. You know where they switch the categories and they move all around. Okay. A Fort Lauderdale. Hello. This is your first time I have a damn some people laying out of the hairdo before. I think you should announce that you're a fairy. Oh yeah. Ferry. And that's what we fly to. Okay. We have our own airlines. I believe it. Okay. I have a nice day. What a call. Yeah. Boy. I'm very sorry. He's a very nice listener to it. 1140 to 18-0 and a W-I-O-D. And let's go to see what they like to do is throw that in there. What they don't realize it gets another like two points every time. Because it brings all the queens out of the closet. Not in my not saying that in any relationship to anything that we played in the last couple of minutes. Okay. Or said. Or said. Okay. Boca. Hello. Hello. Hi. I know. I'm a little bit late. Thank you so much sir. And I would say. How are your wings today? Go ahead. I'm just kidding. Fine. I'm going to die from the clown college's on, uh, well, he's going to go out. I don't like to say I have to be birthday to my friend Tracy, but, uh, I'm going to say Tracy. It's against, uh, I know I'll but go ahead. Also, uh, I'd like to give you a little fire report of the upcoming format change that's data for. Yeah. This is a little preview. Yeah. He's right. I have to go shopping. John, from my water. He needs some coffee. I can see it. That said. You got it. That's your big good for about a one two shouldn't it? Well, they speak Spanish. So we'll be covered. What that is? Uh huh. Uh huh. And why do you keep wait a minute. Sir, you're a great caller, but you have this. It's like it's like the before and the after and he started out. Uh huh. And now he's doing. Uh huh. You notice that? I'm pushing up a little. You're going to have to work on this. You're going to have to get out of your system. Okay. After that last call. Yeah. Right. Anyway, uh I wouldn't know. Would you be playing blow fly? No. No. Remember that? Oh, we don't have it. No. No. They burned that into the backyard. They burned that into the Rick Edwards Memorial Field out there. I think that's true. Yeah. They did. They had a little burning session. Well, listen. It's right here from your Syria. A wonderful caller and work on it. Okay. All right. Thank you. Okay. Good luck to you. I'm going to read a house. Wait a minute. He was on six. I do miss. I think I just disconnected the caller and polka. Oh, God. Oh, I'm really, you know, what? What everybody's got to understand. It's the first day. I just don't understand that I keep pressing off. Okay. Let's move along. Okay. Because the nothing that irritates me more listening. Then here in some douchebag on here, who just can't get the technical stuff down. I'm just fumbling around and munk it. I just press on and good luck to you. Okay. This is a mobile and Palm Beach. Deal. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Hey. This is the boat doctor. How are you? The boat doctor. This is you remember related to the tree doctor. No, we had this matter. In fact, he stole my name. We had your picture on the bulletin board. Is A to four with more Ghana. No, but that picture, Neil. On the bulletin board. Yeah. I'm sure that's the boat doctor. Now I've got something new for this new holiday season, which I am imposing in a cart. A birthday card for Neil. Uh-huh. So that'll be sent out shortly. So take a look. Now, can you give us any hint? No, no, no. I'm sure that's a fake. I'll take you as seen it because I dropped him off. What it is? I don't want to go to my say, Mike. What are you going to keep it a little secret? And you'll have it by the end of the week. Okay, sir. Let me ask you a question. Have you heard of the mystery picker? Yes. Okay. For a nominal fee, I'll tell you who it is. Okay. Because I do know who it is. All right. Now, which nostril is that involved, sir? The writer the left. Okay. So for what I'm calling about, I have both Uncle Banzai Album. Ah! And I was honored if you would take him in a tape off him. Boy, I would be great. How are you going to get him here? Are you going to mail him to us? Bo doctor? He was in a car phone and we just lost. He'll take care of it. Right. How are we? Trust me. I didn't touch anything. Okay, the day has happened. I was car fawning you and I'm sure he's still listening. And the thing to do either to mail him to us or he can drive all the way down here. If he's a fool and bring him here. But that's a long, schleph from Palm Beach. Nobody's that crazy. All right. But if he mail them to us, you know, puts him in one of those mailers, record mailers, and we'll take good care of him and we'll double off and we'll say you'll send him back. Yeah. True. Okay. 11.46 in WIOD. Steve this afternoon is going to have a fist fight in the studio. We're going to have blacks for bush and blacks for new caucus. And then we're going to have some blacks who say to how with both of them. Okay. So we're going to like spread it all around. That didn't you say last week that blacks for bush is the same as Jews for Hitler. Exactly. Something like that. Great. Now, Nick tells us he's voting for bush. I'm going to get really hysteria. You're not voting for bush. Are you? He says no. He says to how with both of them, right? He's going to vote for New Caucus because he never stole a freight train. Okay. The signs he needs to vote desperately. Yeah. I want to say this and I realize that in fact, we're going to be on the air during voting tomorrow. Do you realize that? We're going to make a big impact in Florida where bush is only about 172 points ahead. But that that's Senate race man. If we can't do better in County Mack and Bill and McCay, Buddy McCay, that's got to be two of the worst e-haws that I've ever seen in my life. Talk about rednecks. Where did Barrow say they were in Lakeland today? Yeah. Hang in there. You want to know they're probably at the ABC. I think it's X, Y, Z, you know. Unbelievable. Okay. We're going to go to Palm Beach again. Man, he's got like a Palm Beach fetish. But you know something it's good because that's an easy one for me to get because it's his Palm Beach on a line. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes sir. Congratulations. Are you mobile sir? I'll be damned. Hey, that's great. Yeah. Get the hello. Hey, listen. Yeah. You were talking about trying to be number three. Yeah. What you got to do is set on Rob and the Creaton Woodhouse. He always comes in sir. On a C'mon, be nice sir. Bobby Woodhouse, never met a horse he didn't like. Yeah, but he only runs a five to two when he comes in first. Well, what are you betting on him for sir? It sounds like sour grapes to me. Nice. In fact, tomorrow is Tuesday that means a car will be open and Rob. That's what you're going to be giving you our pick for the day. Okay. Speaking of the mystery picker. He's the wonderful lady. Who's that? The mystery picker. Oh, yeah, is she? Yeah. He's about one percent. I thought she was Hank Goldberg. Hank Goldberg. These guys people are all confused. You know, I heard him talk of the mystery picker and it was a woman. Yeah. Now, Nick says the mystery picker is Hank. We don't know. We don't know what it is. Hey, Neil, congratulations to a hell of a job. Thank you sir. You're a wonderful American and have a great day and stay off the roads. Will you please? Yeah, get out of here. Okay. Now, obviously it's going to take a few days to sort this mystery picker thing out. I know that's to me that was the heaviest thing that I heard all morning was that mystery picker man. I went nuts. There's obviously a lot to this because it was reminiscing that the day we came in here and back for that press conference, five o'clock and it were three grown men that were yanking on his level. I tried to pull it out of his nose. Most embarrassing scene I have ever seen in my life. And I got into this where they did it just before five. Just in the nicotine, they got it out of there and then he came in and started smoking and came when Craig. Oh, that was incredible. Yeah, I mean, one thing I got to say, the atmosphere in this building, it's like a real radio station. The people are friendly, but you do sense there is just a little undercurrent of tension. You know what I'm saying? In other words, most of the people are really nice and friendly, but there's certain rivalries that exist in the building, okay? Rival. Like for example, Steve and the sports department are just a little bit at odds. Okay. Because I noticed when Sunny left this morning at his deep in voodoo doll, he was sticking up into the building. I imagine, but I just have because we don't want it to be too seropy. Okay. We don't work well in that kind of way. I don't think you're not worried about it. Everybody loves each other and just tickles all over each other. We like like every once in a couple of weeks, a little blood bath out in the hall is good. Okay. So 11 to 50, 10 till nude on 610 Wiod. Here's what 55 in Wiod. Then he'll round your show this jar. inaugural show in Wiod. We want to thank everybody for being so wonderful. Wonderful. And syrupy and the cooperative and everything. And we want to thank mother and cookies. The food is coming in here, man. You think that we were having a lot of fun raser for the community. By the way, I noticed that they were in more power to him because it's my favorite charity in town. I noticed that the morning show and I was listening to coming to work was raising money for the Camilla's house. Yeah. I heard that too. Wasn't that interesting? Wasn't it a station that we're like, they were playing all of our cards? Yeah. But that's okay because like I said, Dave's a great guy. I wish him all the luck. But mother, M's cookies is in over an incredible batch of chocolate chip cookies. And they've got M and M's at them. Yeah, my favorite. It is. It's too bad. I can't eat all that sugary sweet stuff. Yeah. But anyway, we want to thank Lou. No, Laurie. Laurie. Laurie would be surprised if her name turned to Lou. Laurie, Joey Lee and Cindy. And mother, M's cookies. And they have a digital beeper. Wow. Is there a number? Should I give that or should I give their address? Do you address? I give. 85, 20 Southwest, 130, third Avenue. Avenue Road. Uh-huh. In Miami. Avenue Road. That 85, 20 Southwest, 133. Avenue Road. In Miami. Or that is bizarre. No wonder they got a digital beeper. I think we thank them very much. Let's take a call from the water. Hello. Yeah. It stems from. Hey, how you doing? Good. Congratulations on the move to the I.O.G. Thank you. How come you're not in school today? I was fortunate enough to have a two-fake. Oh, great. That's a good excuse always, isn't it? But that one. But it's true this time. Um, what? Okay. Listen. Here's a good idea for you. Take a piece of string. Tie it around about like four of your teeth. And tie it to the door knob. And then run like a bat on a hill. I try that one. It works great. Um, happy blade birthday. Thank you. And Greg, congratulations for the move to. All right. Thank you. You sound very similar to STEM. No. He does not. I'm better than STEM. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, it's not going to get any idea. Yeah. I get into the thing. Because STEM is very sensitive. He's been under a lot of direct and a lot of pressure. And we want to make sure that, you know, we take all the pressure off. No, he has the same sort of speed. No, he doesn't. You don't sound anything like him, do you? No, STEM's a literate. Well, that's true. This is very true. And we've been working on him diligently about that. Doesn't seem to help. There's no sense. There's no feeling. Yes. Everybody calling up and saying, the first I could be the first, you know, collar under 19. Yeah, now you're like what? 14? Yeah. Are you? Yeah. Now this is Adam? Yeah. See? I'm a sharpest amongst of all today, right, Adam? Yeah. Yeah. My sure am. And with faces, okay? Yeah. Now, what are you going to send your picture over with STEM? Just a joke, Adam. You're only for one hundred years old. It's just a little joke, right? Yeah. Okay. Listen, have a wonderful day. I hope you get your two straight now. I think good luck with the show. Thank you. Bye. Isn't that great? That was the mysterious STEM's mysterious brother. Uh-huh. Oh, there are people from here. My amy. Hello. Great. Welcome to AM. Thank you so much sir. Welcome back to AM. Listen, I want to clarify you on the mystery picker. If you would put me on a hold, I will tell you with a mystery picker. He's I don't want to do it. I mean, no. Am I stepping on something here that's like really a big secret? Because I'm just joking about it. But is it really a big deal? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. You know, if you put me on hold with the bird, I will tell the bird. Now, we'll just dump it out. Why? I just go ahead and I'll dump it. I won't let it on the other. Really? Okay. I dumped that. Did that work? Okay. Okay. I can get for that meal. You make me hungry over the airway. Yeah. Well, I'll say to some cookies. Okay. We'll say to whatever's left. We'll say to some of the crust from the pizza from Johnny G's. That's right. And we'll say to some of the bones from a Tony Rome is okay. In fact, well, even saying to some of the bones from the Juliettele is not a good thing. Okay. Well, that's the best. It's our first day. I mean, what do you expect? Like a big operation here on the first day? No, but this is classified stuff. Okay. Is there real appreciate it? Well, how do you know? How do you know this? Because I got the inside track bird. I'll be doing. He probably saw the telltale markings of that fingernail. That's how you tell the mystery. Picker every time. Okay. Listen, Pat, you're a great guy. I appreciate it. Thanks a lot. Okay. Also, I want to thank the people that the mother Cookies who set us and I'm not sure. I don't understand it because it says WIOD on the top of the record. It's a 45 and on one side, it says never again or old to Zeta 4 by Laurie Hanan. And on the other side, it says lonely DJ or old to Joey. Wow. So I'm going to have to listen to that. He's probably going to get a mom. We'll be viewed them here tomorrow exclusively on the Neo Roger show. Okay. April 4th of his back with the news coming up at noon. And then we'll be back at 12.5 to more hours to go. We'll be along at 2 as always here on 610 WIOD. WIOD, Miami 4th of Lyria, Tom Toss with Steve Kane, the saffron unit 2 on New Scott Radio 610 WIOD. He's been done. To get in touch and talk, call 751 WIOD in date. 524 WIOD in Broward or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect. The opinions expressed by the host guest or callers are not necessarily those of the station. Now, here's Neo Rogers on New stock radio 610 WIOD. 1260 WIOD and did you say the ribs are gone? Gone. That clean. It was incredible. Yeah. See, that's one thing about you in a radio station. What was that? Did you just hear that? What was that? That was like a line. What was that, Nick? Was that I imagine that? Did you just hear a line disconnecting? No, I didn't hear him. Okay, must be losing my mind. Okay, I swear to you, this phone thing is bizarre. It's going to take me a couple of days. But anyway, being in a radio station, no matter how much food comes in, you can always be confident if you lay it out in the cafeteria within 20 minutes. It's gone. We're not complaining about that. That's what we want. Yeah. That's the idea. We're going to feed these people by the time six months goes by. Instead of all these anorexic looking people on diets, walking around here, they're going to be walking through, going to make me look like Nicky Mouse. Okay. That's the idea. See, I don't know about. A little meat on the bones of these people for crying out loud. I don't know about mother Rogers, but my mother always taught me never to let food go to waste. Exactly. Always use it. He's like candy. Yeah. We're going to be eating that corn. We're going to waste. We're going to want to want to discuss things as somebody's people. From mother M. You watch it because coming in. He's eating on the air. It's the most disgusting thing. I can't remember. Yeah. Let me tell you something. That's worth at least two points in the book. Okay. Tell you, budding broadcasters out there. Just get food brought in and just make a slow body yourself and that'll do it. Hey, your fans. We ever discovered. You're hanging around my house in the mirror. I want to talk to you about what you need to do. Doesn't turn out. I want to put it this way. Yeah. Wasn't you who did the push-ins put the same's upon the cushion for Prince of the dashboard upside down. Okay. What? Wasn't you? You broke a bill. Been messing with my daughter Jill. If it was, you'd better leave this town. Well, you're going to say it. Yes. So as I did the push-in put this thing. Yeah. Yeah. But since I miss you with your daughter, I've been trouble passing water. So I guess we're keeping all the rails. What are you doing? Come on. Come on. Ah. Okay. It's been a chapter 12 of WIOD. And until we go back to the phones down. See how many of these seconds grew up. We got that clown college collar on sick. Should I get him on now? Yeah. Sure. Well, sometimes do these out of order and next going to get start getting hysterical about that. But just, he doesn't carry. He's easy to get along with. Are you there? Yeah, I'm here, you're doing. I'm not bad. Are you? Everybody loves a clown. That's what they say. Yeah. That's what Gary Lewis said. Look what it did for him. That's only going to job with a circus. Are you cereal doing one? I'm working with a Clyde BD8. Call me. Hey. McMark. Fantastic. Now this is the, I mean, for the benefit of the audience, this is the young guy who went to clown college over on a west coast in Venice. Was it Venice? Yeah. Venice. And he wanted to be a clown and here he is. He got a job and everybody can go see him where. It starts in the land and I don't know if I can come back down in five, five, five, five, five, four, again, because they bought the land. They used to use and they're going to make them all out of it. Wow. But they might come into my end. I don't know. I don't know. I've got the schedule. Yep. Let's great. In other words, you're going to be on the road all the time. Got it. Up down the east coast. Well, that's what you always wanted to do. I've got the right to go. Thank you. Congratulations to both of you. Can't believe you followed us over here. Okay, why not? Listen, listen, listen. I want to give you a little assignment before you go heading off to Delayon to ready play Cells. And this is true for every one of our listeners because word of mouth is what it's all about. Now, I guarantee there are a lot of people. A lot of our pinheads out there don't know where we are yet, okay? All right. So you have to spread the word, like go out with sandwich boards and walk up and down, Lincoln Road Mall stuff like that. Okay, dude. Okay. Good luck to you. Take care of me at the clowns. Great. So you can see what I look like. Okay. Take care of your liking. Okay. In fact, if you come by the station sometime the next few months, we'll have a picture of you in the mystery picker together. Okay. So watch out for that big clown nose because good luck to you. Thank you. Okay. What's that exciting? Yeah. The mystery picker. Boy, I heard that. I thought man, this renearies just falling right into the whole thing, you know? Perfectly. Okay. Let's go to a pop-in-o. Hello. Neil. Yes, sir. A horrible, horrible story, more horrible than horrible. How horrible is it, sir? More horrible than all of Friday the 13th movies with enough leftover for the Chinese Army. Okay. You may remember, I made a call into the Steve Kancho last Friday. That's horrible, sir. And I brought up a mystery sight image name who I refer on the air. Now you're really getting horrible. Listen, I refer to him as a scum-sucking maggots, similar in quality to reptile excrement. Do you remember the call? No. Yeah. Of course I remember. You'll never fully end. You will never believe what happened on Friday evening. What's in? I showed up at the playoff to see the fights. Uh-huh. Steve Kain was there. With Rick. With Rick. Uh-huh. He's in a male bonding thing, not feeling what I'm saying. It was he Rick and his lovely wife, Laurie. I've been into that male bonding thing for a long time, but Steve's just getting into it. Okay. Yeah. This gets worse. Yes, sir. The scum-sucking maggots was with him. Yeah. I didn't do it myself to him. He remembers me and he said, I want you to come over and say hello to Rick. I said, no thank you. He said, you gotta come over. He's a great guy. Yeah. I resisted initially. I want to tell you that I did. And I told you you'd be a hypocrite if you ever did this. That's right. I did resist. But he offered to buy me a drink so I went. It gets worse. Okay. I spent the night with Rick's side of him and Steve came. What? What? I sat at the same table. I looked across and Rick's side of him and said you're a scum-sucking maggot. Yeah. But you know what? At the end of the night, I can't believe I'm saying this. He's not that bad of guy. Oh my god. Neil. Steve had some very nice things to say about you. Yeah. And what about Rick? I haven't had nothing bad to say. Oh, I say. You didn't have anything good to say. But he's not having anything bad to say. Well, he's a hell of a guy and I appreciate the call sir. But don't ever call this show again. Okay. You copped out. Here's a guy who was accusing me. Remember what he said? He intimidated me. He said if you ever say anything nice about this guy or try to be a Sprayant. I will never speak to you again. And here's the guy right away. He's sucking up to him because he bought him a drink. Sir, I think you're qualified to be in a business now. Okay. And official WLOD free loader. You know, I'm trying to do the horrible story. It was horrendous. It was, what do you say? Horrible. It was. 1213 at 610 WIOD. Some people have no shame. Take representative. How do you know? He's more with Neil Rogers. You're a stock radio 60. WIOD. 1217 at WIOD. These are incredible. These headphones. These are the worst. They're bad. Woo. I just gave you mine. So I could wear these. No wonder cane doesn't wear these. I mean, he's our like, barely. It sounds like you're in a like in the Arabian desert. Forget those. Okay. So you hang on to those. You're sound wonderful. Yeah. Perfect. Well, those I bought myself. You don't think those cheap skates over there. Bobby headphones do. No. But these are horrendous. Man, he sounds like you're way off like way down a hall somewhere. Like a channel 7. Now, do we really have a wick for one? I don't think so. Coming up, I don't mean like live. But on tape. Are you serious? To a set every day or just a Monday. Every day. What's he do? He talked just a minute. Mr. Weaver to you. Okay. Just to remember that Mr. Weaver to you. I met him. Coming up in just a few minutes. Well, listen, I know just like he had all those dinners with AJ. Do we at the S I. I. This man has got the most incredible imagination. Yeah. Hey, Jay, remember all those great lunches we used to have at the S and that. Who the hell are you? They were dinners. Oh, dinners. Great. Okay. Let's go to him. I'm getting choked up from all the staff. Okay. From that candy was delicious. But my god. How much food can you eat? It's everywhere. Hollywood. Hello. Yeah. Hi. Welcome. Welcome. Oh, my god. It's Steve. Listen. I heard on your last broadcast. You're going to have your presentation with Bill Carter. How is he doing? I don't know. I haven't seen Bill in a few days. I thought you said you're going to go to the caller with him or something. I didn't. I never heard from him. And he, I think he's gone through change of life for something. I don't know what's going on with Bill. But last few days have been getting these strange vibes. And again, my home number to Bob Lasseter. And since then, I've been just a little bit lary. And I think he just needs a little rest. He said a rough year. Oh, true. Yeah. Well, I'm not making that up either. I'm not joking or just something something in the air there. I don't know what it was. See what happened is I forgot his wife's birthday again. And he made some little last time we spoke with you about a week ago. He made some little cost to comment about how a Mary Ellen's birthday, which just passed. And I just, you know, I've had all this stuff going on. And I forgot. And I have a feeling that he just, the harbored some hostility about that. I could be wrong, but you know me. I'm very sensitive. Yeah. Well, so it's Bill. I recall. Yeah. Extremely so. Yeah. If anybody had any idea what's been going under our lives in the last month. Yeah. The last few weeks have been pretty hectic. You can imagine. Well, well, so I just sort of call up and wish you well. And the only one thing I hope you don't get mad at me now, but you might have to say this. I wish you the left Ed McMan wherever you was. Oh, just Ed McMan. Yeah. What I mean, my cackling friend. Right. Why do you say that? Yeah. Why? Well, because he doesn't get treated anything except a non, a not needed support. I mean, I like it. Maybe I shouldn't say that, but that's my true feeling. Now, sir, you know, I'm right here. You can talk directly to me. You don't have to talk to me. He didn't even like his Danny's trying to boycott you. He doesn't recognize you like red China. No, well, no, I wouldn't go that far, but you know, I mean, I've no Neil. I have no, I have no ready for a long time. He doesn't. He didn't did real well before you came along. I think you're more or less a detriment. That's just why. I'd debt your man. Yeah. Don't you think that's a little strong or word to use in that sentence? No, I'll tell you why because I've heard you try to do news and you can't pronounce half the stuff you tried to do. But sir, that would have Steve. Yeah. Have a nice day. Okay. What does that happen to you? Well, Steve is a nice guy. He's very emotional and very high. He's a good girl. And he just gets all been out of shape about my newshure. Yes. Now, this man has parlayed himself into a nice career. He sits here and he cackles and he eats and gets paid pretty nicely now for it now. And leave him alone. Maybe it's jealousy. That could be it. He would like to come in and cackle. Yeah. See, everybody thinks they can do it. And Steve, like I said, is a good guy. But he's a little too nervous to cackle. He's got that nervous kind of quaggle in the voice jealousy. Okay. You get so emotional about these people. Why would you just consider the source? Okay. Just a basket case. So be all right. Very good. Let's go to basketball. Hi, Alia. Hello. How are you guys doing? Great. I don't know what that guy just doesn't leave the bird alone. Are you? You said to have that thing on take with your lady. You're struggling with every once in a while. You know, when the people come out like that, you know, just put the need when they're struggling. They need to bring out something for they bring that out. Yeah. He brought out something. All right. Listen, does this mean now that that maybe we'll get a few people back on to come in and visit you like maybe Tony and Hank and come out and talk to you in that time. I don't know. I don't think Tony will be coming in because Tony works at magic now. So I don't think that he'll be coming in here. I would like to. But I really kind of doubt it. But Hank and come in anytime. Hank's a good friend and a great guy. It's quite a what Steve says. And you know, by the way, Bill Cosford, I should thank Bill Road. A really nice piece in the hero. Yesterday a big article. You didn't see it? No, I didn't. Oh, you wrote a great article about talk radio mostly about me. Oh, you know, the lead team for that now. What's that? No, not that the news is going to go deep six. Stay don't care. That's the same that that people are going out to. Yep. That's true. Harold's got it all locked up now. I'll let the sex and filth and guts. You got rid of Pearl Harvey, huh? Yeah, Paul Harvey. By the way, I'm sure that there are a lot of people bringing a Swiss board right now. Where's Paul Harvey? Oh, I'm sorry. Paul went buy buy. He took his 18th century right wing propaganda when pipeline. He's not on W.I.O.D. anymore. And that's the way it goes. Okay. We don't have time on this show for Paul Harvey. Okay. You know, he used to disrespect him and Carter so much. He was, but when Reagan died, I mean, you know, all of a sudden you can't say anything bad about the president. Yeah, well, Paul is a right wing douchebag. And he liked manipulates the news, you know, accordingly. But he's gone and all those sandy patent listeners who twisted over to here, Paul. Go back over to W's news and take, you know, have a nice life. Take a life. It's standing. Is right out to baby it? Any day. Oh, wow. How old are you keep us in touch and let us know what to do it? Okay. And matter fact, they're going to be filming. It's a live part five. I've just told you, Clark, you're so sensitive. It's just a joke. That was low. No, it's just a little joke. They're doing just fine. And it's going to be a boy. And his name is going to be Christopher something or other, but it's going to be great. Listen, you have to. And we hope it doesn't look like Stan. You have to hang around and have a little talk with the Gaki because a Jim Mandatee, he said yesterday, that he takes it all and stride and then he doesn't let much of that stuff bother him, but Joe is still young and the business and everything. His skin hasn't puffed in the net. Yeah, Joe's a little sensitive, but in fact, he was suicidal. He was here yesterday when I was taping and he was watching the dolphin game. And he was a semi-assuicide. I met Mandatee. He's an ice guy. The shape looks like he could play tomorrow. Yeah, you could go out and, uh, all the way to the little interaction. Everybody around here, pretty good. You know, okay, listen, have a great day. Okay, 2024, WIOD. Rick Weaver and one man's opinion is up next. Dolphin Tettelies and the first shall be last. I'm ready. From 29 at WIOD and our first day is going so well. And this is like a piece of cake. As they say on the tables, like a piece of cake. That could we say the wonderful island dreams. So we'll see that. You can't get a real, sirly when you're saying that. Do they really? Okay, but if you say the wonderful island of Dung, like we used to say, we want somewhere else. Then they say, hey, that's more like it or the men's dementia. Yeah, they like that. See, that's what we used to be someplace else. Now they will be here. It's like, hey, it's great. Okay, let's go to Del Rey. Hello. Hi, Leo. Yes, sir. How are you? Great. Welcome to AM. Yeah. I listen to you from like your second day when you went over to F-Bam and I never called. And I was in Colorado last week when I went on this happen. You changed? Yeah. And my wife called me hysterical crying. And I thought, so what was your client about it? I think the phone I thought, gee, someone in the family's dead. You know, so she tells me, it's finally come down. It was just Leo. You know, you had made your move. I just wanted to call you because I never did in case you disappeared again. I wanted to tell you, good luck on AM. Don't go anywhere. Okay. Now, is your wife okay now? Yes, you've come. Okay. You've got to be okay, sir. Yeah. Fine. Fine. You're going to be okay, sir. Yeah. Fine. Fine. Just wanted to call and say hello and good luck. Good luck to you, sir. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. What? What was he? Wow. Okay. Let's go to Palm Beach again. Shall we? West Palm? We're taking those seems. Are we taking all calls from Palm Beach County? It's incredible. Palm Beach, hello. No, how are you doing? Great. Sounds good too, guys. Sounds like he's right in the building. You and the bird are great Americans, Neil. Are you sure you're not calling from Bill Wise's office, sir? Hi. I asked my name myself. I called in on a fake hate call, figuring you're giving up on the mobile call, figuring I get put on first in the guidance call for it. No. Uh, they're a little too sharp in the other room for that, sir. Yeah. I couple things. That's great. We've wrapped her 50 years on the rules committee and the least penalized team. One year and all of a sudden the officials are bent on over backwards. The hurt the dolphins now. Is that, is that, is that what Rick was crying on? I was really saying they're so penalized this year because the officials are bent and all for backwards. Not to give the dolphins a break because she was on the rules committee. The venue on the rules committee for years for crying. I wanted to admit that they're a bunch of stiffs down there. But sir, why don't you understand, you know, when you have to do those games, when you have to, uh, you know, preside over like a debacle like yesterday, yeah, you'd be upset to you'd be like pulling off our galsawks one after another, okay? But the big question is, is, what's worse, the play on the field of the play by playing the booth? No, no, you're not going to say that. You know, one thing I've consistently said about Rick, regardless of anything I've ever said, he's one of the best. Well, he's not objective, obviously. Who wants him to be objective? When I supported team, I mean, like, when I was a pirate span, all those years and Bob Prince was you now, so he was as partisan as could be. Or like, if you're a Cub span, Harry carries great because he's for the home team. But that list, that little little sound, but he just did was really ridiculous. Very inconsistent. Well, if you say so, we didn't listen to it because we were in here, but we were in here too, but we were in here, so we were looking for a schmoozing, okay? Whatever you say, I'll go along with it. Just to make you happy. Try to call your kin, Nick. He's been suffering with these miserable teams the last few years. Now that it can handle it. Try to call your Friday when you and Jecker were trying to figure out why cane hangs around with the treating, that he does outside of work. Because cane obviously is a pretty sharp guy. Is a good talk show host. I think it's a great moment. Why is somebody who's a good talk show host? Pretty sharp guy. I mean, I'm not knocking Steve, but what makes you assume that because somebody is good the about a bunch of days, all I can I hear on the air. He sounds like you pretty sharp got a good personality's quick. And I agree with him to some degree, but his philosophy seems to change. I think the answer to him hanging around with Mr. Ciderman is he does. Mr. Ciderman. Boy, that's a mislead. He's here to use. Yes. Yeah, that's loose. I definitely lose wrong phrase. They're Ciderman in general. Yeah. And I think somebody has as long as they help him with his stick and his bank account. Yeah, I'm not like that. If somebody to me is a virulent right wing douchebag, I'm just not going to hang around with that person because it just cuts across my grain. You know what I'm saying? Obviously it takes more than buying you a drink to get you going to another table and change your philosophy. I'm trying out a good meal. Maybe that's another stir. And the people that I heard that you seemed that they had his friends like Mr. Hill there and they kept the day that the other station. You were far better off with the individuals you hang around with away from the microphone. Well, see I have a rich full life unlike Steve who has this his shows his whole life sir. It's just a little joke. It's about that promo that he did. Are you following me? Sir, I'm going to draw you a diagram. Okay, listen, have a wonderful day to get out of your system. Keep up the good work. Because Rick we've responding on the window and saying your number one. Well, we've either the wet or man needs a replacement. Okay, you're lucky. Wow. Hostel and the sterile. Sure, what? Okay, I should give the numbers out. The phones have been going nuts, but I know we have a lot of young pinheads out there who want to call through our old AM listers and they're just at a loss. They have no idea what's going on. And then makes two of us. A date County 751 WIOD Broward 524 WIOD Book and Del Ray 278 WIOD. Thank you, and these numbers out of the room and in Palm Beach 655 WIOD 1234 and April 4th, I'm back with a quick WIOD news update. We're up to our long distance dedication. And this one is about kids and pets and a situation that we can all understand, whether we have kids or pets or neither. It's from a man and Cincinnati Ohio and here's what he likes. Dear Casey, this may seem to be a strange dedication request, but I'm quite sincere and it'll need a lot if you play it. Recently, there was a death in our family. He was a little dog made a little dog. He was a little dog. He was a little dog. He was a little dog named Snuckles, but he was most certainly a part of his company again. From coming out of the record. Play the record, okay? Please. See, when you come out of those up-tempo, damn numbers, man, is impossible to make those transitions. And then you got to go into somebody dying. You know, they do this to me all a time. I don't know what they hell they do it for, but damn it if we can't come out of a slow record, I don't understand that. I'm not on the phone. Okay, I want to damn concerted effort to come out of a record that isn't a thing up-tempo record every time I do a damn death dedication. Now, make it, and I also want to know what happened to the pictures I was supposed to see this week. It's a god last damn time. I want somebody who's a fucking brain to not come out of a damn record that is, that's up-tempo, and I got to talk about a control dying. Well, it's a ponderous man. Ponderous. Ponderous. Ponderous. Well, you can say that again. Okay, I think so. What a WIOD that he arrangers Monday show and everything is just zippin' right along. This has been too easy, hasn't it? Okay, don't forget sports talk at 610 tonight. Live from Tony Romas in David. Really? Well, you're going to have some guts to go to the team after that dolphins gaming yesterday with the Rick Leaver and Joseph Gackie and then at 8 o'clock tonight. Rush Lindbott, Tom Snyder, and Larry King. What's the question? At 11 o'clock tonight. Yeah. Okay, let's continue. Let's go back to Miami. Hello. And there. Yeah. Yeah. I'm not canola, you know, when you used to always say how Rick Leaver never takes a shower. I know. I never said he never took a shower. I said that there was something about his feet. I'm not sure exactly what it was. But I said that the, the little tap dance after some of the games, and that as a result, some of his feet were like, what do they call that? Eximple or something? I don't know. I thought they were like that. And you said, don't you understand? We have to be nice to these people. Now we can't come over here and talk about the Rick's feet. I'm not going to back away. I mean, when his main topic, but it was the mystery picker. What is that? Okay. Okay. I want one other thing. I like grandma. But like he never talks. And when he does, he never, he just says a couple words. That's the idea. He gave a very spirit. That's a idea of a problem with that sir. I don't understand. The station could save like 5,600 a week. How do you know, how do you know he's making 5,600 a week? He could be making more than that or less. Yeah, but are you jealous or would you like to get paid by the cackle? But he doesn't even answer the phone. He doesn't do anything. He does nothing exactly. And that's the way he likes it. Okay. We can't. You know, this is not way to come. I can't. Okay. What's that? Because there's food in here. You missed the pizza. And the two Steve and the ribs from Tony Romas. That's right. But there's some cookies from mother-m's cookies here. And there's all of these. And the stuff from eats and treats. Okay. See, we don't mess around. But watch him though, because he's got to watch his way. He's gotten just a little on the puffy side. I wouldn't say fat, but he's got a lot of food. I like it. No, what you gained in law, Stino, when you get to be his oldest. You are, I don't know anybody is old as you are. Have the cookies right here. Do you like some of those? I should cookie. They want some. I'm going to show them, so these are delicious. And you missed the ribs, but they disappeared like Grant took old. They put them down in the cafeteria, and they just swooped him up. Go with that eating until Wednesday night, there didn't you just save my appetite? Yeah. By the way, Glenn invited to that chill. Well, who else going to be there Tom Jika you mean Steve? Oh, I'll count. At the depot. We're going to meet at the depot 7 o'clock. Okay. And the audience can come watch a seat. If you move quickly, it's good stuff. Well, phedian out Steve. This isn't like, yeah, concert had a great column. The name always does. Thank God for Bill. In fact, we're going to have them on the show. One of these days, if he ever comes back to town. A little bit. But he did. Oh, yeah, that little part about how he's become a very comfortable with any subject. And what the hell is that all about? Well, I would speculate. But yeah, perhaps we'd better pass on that. Although, maybe when you have Jack Sturney on in a few days, he can answer the question for you. I can't answer all questions. Oh, there you go. I have a couple of minutes. I'll answer them. OK, 1244. It's 16 to one. Air steam is getting ready for his contract debate today, too. And let's go to Kendall and I shall wait. Well, I'm finally getting the hang of this thing on a phone. Great. Right? Finally. Took a little while. I'm a little slow, but the sooner or later. OK, Kendall, hello. Oh, my God. Yes, sir. I'm on the air. These phones sound so damn good. You know what? Hmm, God, that sound better. You sound better on the end than you did on that. Yeah, FM was really a loser. Wasn't it? Yeah, we had big numbers, but we just didn't have the right audience for the management over there. Yeah, we were getting a early morning, huh? Yes, some lightweight air waves. Yeah. A couple of things. I tried, like, like, hell, when you're on FM to get through to you to ask you a question. OK, what's the question, sir? The question was, I guess probably about a month ago, all of a sudden, cable was playing over and over again, this movie about explorers and these kids and river Phoenix. Oh, forget it. Well, the question that I had was, and it's an old question already, but it's still probably qualifies as a decent one. What was all the talk prior to that all last year or what have you, the summer, about this guy River Phoenix? That's good. What was all the talk by who you didn't hear me talk about him? I learned what was the one that was talking about him constantly. He's got, like, a river. He thinks River Phoenix, I guess, looks like a girl. OK. That must be it. Now you guys are all. That's what they're talking about. He's got this female feed spinach. He's very big in the feed-be-cates. And I think he thinks that somewhere along the line, the two of them are related. Like, you don't see him in the same room. They must be the same. That is correct. In fact, if you stripped them, both start naked of all their clothing, there'd be a lot of similar body parts. I don't think. I think we were talking about his name, River. And it's an old rainbow. No, there were some people who had, in fact, back when we were on AM. You had this thing about River Phoenix constantly. And we kept playing stand by me, which I'm going to have to put on cart. Everyone over again. Phoenix, it was Jeff Stryker. I mean, well, now you're getting a little... Yeah, now you're getting a little bit closer to the truth. In fact, Stryker's going to be on with Steve, one of these days soon. And I might just hang around for 20 or 30 minutes. See what's going on. Listen, when you went to FM, in fact, I think when you were still at AM, before you went to FM, you lost or it was taken from you, if I had a peanut. Oh, yeah. We're getting Uncle Bonsai. No, not if I had a peanut, it's called peanuts. And the way you say that, sir, it sounds so, you know, debasing and disgusting. It's like something River Phoenix would say. Oh, it's envy in the day of an album. What you have to get from Jerry the Boat Doctor. No, no, Uncle Bonsai was at the guy, the Boat Doctor. Yeah, yeah. He's sending it to his or bring it by or putting it on a boat and sending it down the intercostal or something. And in a couple of days, we'll have it for you. Jerry floats around all the counties. You can probably have a lot of listeners who load around all the counties. Okay, if you know what I mean? I can probably expect him to drop in with that album. But that's right. Is that you have that cut on cart now? No, you lost it. Are you listening to me? Sir, that's what we're waiting. We need the Boys Want Sex in the morning. Gotcha. Piness and the Internet. One other one on there that we used to play, which I can't think of at the moment, but when he brings him in, we'll double him. Fantastic. Get out of stick, Jerry. Well, good job. Okay, sir. Thank you for the inside call and have a wonderful day. Quite many. Oh, bye. Who the hell was that? No idea. Good guy, but I mean, they sounded like a little in to me. Well, man, who's he? There he is. Now that you're on the same station as Jimmy Johnson. And you still think it looks like how he did it on a bad day? Oh, are you sexually attracted to him now? Neither one, sir. Is this Mr. Bluster? No, okay. I think that was the second call if I'm not mistaken. Of course he looks like how he did it on a bad day. I wish he'd get a new wig, okay? Come on. It's still one WIOD and our next call is in Miami. Hello. Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. Great to see you on the new station. Well, good. It's good to see you, too. Listen. In fact, as I look through the speaker, I can almost get the feeling. I could reach out and touch you. Yeah, you wish. Yeah. Maybe. I think you would. Okay. Well, that sounds pretty interesting, sir. How long would you like to talk about a half an hour? Well, I don't know. Maybe you want to spend a half hour jet striker. Okay. Whatever you say, pal. Listen, when are you going to boat some time to talking about what happened last year with that clown and girl gable? Oh, no. We can't discuss anything even remotely related to that. Okay, sir. We want to do what we have any dessert, too. Okay. I just was wondering because I heard you mentioned that. The day will come someday, way ahead of road, but not now. Yeah, right. There's an interesting article in the Sunday hurled in the local section concerning that class. I saw it. But like I said, sir, we can't discuss it. Great. I like to do a little experiment. How long is your time to line? Seven seconds? Yeah. Okay. I'd like to do the first person to introduce. Okay. Have a nice day. I mean, is it worth it? Is it worth injecting myself to a lot? So people are so easily amused. Incredible. Okay, 1249. It's 11 before 1 in WIOD. And we're going to do the melting pot now because I just can't wait. Good. And those of you who see, we have a whole new opportunity to turn people out of the great fun to do a melting pot because we have a whole, I don't want to say a whole new audience because a lot of these people are like carryover from other places gone by. But I'm guaranteed we have a lot of people who never even heard of the melting pot. They have three locations. They're in West Palm. They're on Sunset Drive down in South Miami and they're on Sample Road in Orol Springs. And when it comes to fondue, you can't touch the melting pot. In fact, not only just fondue, but when it comes to having a good relaxing enjoyable dinner with friends having a nice bottle of wine, great service, very moderate prices, nice atmosphere. Then the melting pot is the place. Any night, seven nights of the week, beginning at 5 o'clock, 430 on Sunday down in Kendall. And whether you choose the cheese, the cheddar cheese or a Swiss cheese fondue or the beef chicken, seafood or vegetarian main course or the white chocolate with emaretto or chocolate fondue dessert. The food is always sensational. It's kind of fun because you cook it right at your own table. And as I said, it's always a real treat at the melting pot. You try to watch. You're going to be hooked. You go back time and time again. You'll find them at 344 South Military Trail in West Palm. 9, 8, 35 Sunset Drive in South Miami. Just up the road from the birds house. Right. The local road in Carl Springs, just to my west of the university, just a couple of blocks east of Pine Island Road. You tell a local meal center by a forefandt, fantastic fondue of the melting pot. Here's a tip for travelers. Now you've been a girl in money every time you fly. Red of car. Red of car. Red of car. Bob Silver. Henry Burrell. All part of South Florida's morning show every week they right here. Now, back to Neil Rogers on Newstalk Radio 6th and WIOD. This is the most disgusting program. I urge everyone to complain to this station. Okay, it's 1253 at WIOD that he eroges your show. Steve is in a building. He'll be a logger too. Wow. I know you're excited about that. Let's take our next call from Hollywood. Hello. Well, Neil. Yes, sir. Have a question for you and then a question for the bird. Okay. I first I want to say happy birthday. Thank you. Thanks. And I know Sally fits very nicely that did she blow out your candles? Next question, sir. Okay. Because when it's my birthday, she can certainly blow mine. But anyway. Candles. Oh, yeah. Okay, sir. Yes, sir. You probably didn't know this all that time. I'm one of the people that listened to what. One Zeta, but I never really called in. Is that one where? Was it? On Zeta 4? Oh, yeah. I remember that. Yeah, I saw that. And you guys were always talking about Joey as one of the main major competitors or something like that. Yeah. You gave him a lot of scare time. But actually the way I saw it, your main competitor was some guy called Zippo in the morning. Zippo. Yeah. I don't understand. There was like there's a guy on AM 12 9 D AM. They called Zippo in the morning. I used to switch. 12 9 D AM. What is that? What's all of that? WPP. Wait a minute. Yeah, WPP. The big P.P. on your radio. Yeah. Palm Beach Gold. Oh, yeah. Yeah. That's a heavyweight for you. Zippo in the morning. Where's this guy, Colin from anyway? They played the real classic. Are you in Jupiter, sir? No, I think he's on your reign. It's okay. 255 on WIOD. Well, that was an incredible call. Wasn't it? I'm Zippo. Analyzing that in my mind. Okay. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. How you doing? I feel like I'm an old friend of the Washington cell-off. Well, it sounds like you're getting older by the minute, pal. Well, I'm waiting on the line all this time. That'll do it. Yeah. I have a question for you. How come we're not coming to Palm Beach? It's your truck. How come I'm not coming to Palm Beach? Because they didn't buy my show again. I may sound petty, but it's like two or the last three years. When I was still over on Zeta, we had the number one show in the morning. We had the best demographics by far of anybody. And they played politics over there with their advertising. And as a result, I just made up my mind. I don't need them. Okay. And I'm just don't need them. Opening night, we looked where we heard you had a reservation. Yeah, I did. That's right. When I discovered what the politics were going on, I said, how would them? And that's the way I feel. That's still fun, track. Well, great. I mean, I'm looking at it and they're getting like 2,200 people on a week night and 2,400 people. They can't afford to alienate their friends. You know, but the problem over there is they have never learned who their real friends are. And they're going to pay for it. I'm great. I don't get me wrong. I love harness racing and it's a great. I feel it's a great sacrifice that I make because I'd love to go there a couple of times. A week, but I don't need them. I know. I can use that money for better purposes. Okay. Time to stop the train there now. You're not missing anything. Anyhow. Yeah, you know, those 340 and 280 and 260 who need that. Okay. We're going to have to read dolphins. Take a start when the show is off. There you go. Can't get the dolphins. At least we've filled up the stadium, right? Yeah. Well, we're saying I listen to Captain Dave this morning. Yeah. But that's all over there. And now you left him stranded. Yeah. And now he doesn't know what to do. Well, they're kind of in limbo. And it's, you know, Pete Bolger intended we were going to be there. We'd probably still be on the air over there. We threw this week if things were to kind of go to the whole. But the upper level management again, not to mention any specific names to him. But the upper level management had a blurred it out to the newspapers and put it out in public. And as a result, we just, you know, we just all decided to be better to go our separate ways a little bit sooner. But I don't know what they're going to do. I really don't. Everything could bring Captain Dave ever with it. Well, you know, it's hard enough to get two people hired. But to get a station to hire three is pretty tough, especially for a midday show. If we had been on in the morning again somewhere, would have been different. Because, you know, three people really takes to do a morning show. But to do a midday show, pretty hard to sell that. And now he doesn't talk about you guys. Well, Neil, we're here. Are you doing that? Yeah. Okay. Really. Yeah. Neil, we're there. He'd be pulling his hair out. Okay. You have no idea. But I tell you, I tell people it's like being let off death row. Like subhuman garbage. And he just never stopped harassing and pulling bits out and not out to death. And by popping, you know, and blaming us for the failures of the rest of the day, which to me is incredible. Yeah. But to bring me in and sit me down and say, well, you got to be more positive about the rest of the day. And I said to them, I said, look, I could pay each one of my listeners 50 bucks of peace. And if they don't like the music you're playing the rest of the day, they're not going to listen to it. Okay. So instead of looking at themselves in a lot of that obscure, marginal, non-edity music that they seem insistent upon playing and say, maybe we need to change that. They kept pointing the finger at us while you're not, you know, not selling the rest of the day. Well, who the hell could sell it? Well, you can't even move from the numbers then they should be delivered. Yeah. Well, good luck to them. Okay. They're going to get there. Okay. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. Why these people sound like they're on a really emotional trip here today, aren't they? Okay. Speaking of elderly, let's go to Lake Hora, Philo. Lake Hora. Oh, they're the poorest kids, most probably worse Angah doesn't pay the fact that they're lower than half of their kids and they might sell money early on. Was they a rich kid here in the World? In the World thriving of my kids. Oh, well. I guess that, it was an localsment. It's not that They obviously deserve to be like a boomerah in Scotland. So are you going to average used to having I could win in a normal life. place out there where they take these surgically removed these themented things from your brain okay they just reach in there and they lift them right out we got our work cut out for us. I favor it. Go we're up for it. We're left out fast. See she should have said. You're my favorite fat fat. I suppose just any old fat. Okay you miserable bitch. Okay listen that's about it for this hour we got only one hour to go can you believe this we just sat down here at a food came in and everybody said a great mood and Rick changed his socks and everything it's incredible and who is the mystery picker by the way Steve has got to reveal the identity of the mystery picker on the cane show this afternoon. Stick around now April's back with the news and we'll come back in 105 here on 610 WIOD. This is Neil Rogers. To get a touch and talk call 751 WIOD in day 524 WIOD in Rullard or 655 and 278 WIOD in the Palm Beach. Other areas may call collect the opinions expressed by the host guest or callers. I'm not necessarily those of the station now here's Neil Rogers. New sock radio 610 WIOD. Okay so what were we saying about those gunless wonders in Portland main? Oh we're back. Five minutes after one WIOD Steve is in a building he'll be along at two and in the meantime we're going to get in a lot of calls this time but we also have a couple of must play things that we're going to do. Right. Right. That's right. But first deep throat. Hello. Do you? Stroke. Are you really there? I think so. Five hours we get through and you've only been on the air for four. By the way, at Palm Beach line it really takes me off his open again. 655 WIOD for you. Steve's up in the Palm Beach is. Where are you all farce up there in the Palm Beach is? Go ahead sir. Get to do this on my time. Yeah go ahead. This is a clear Neil. By the way, Neil have you worked there. Thank you. Congratulations. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I was right. By the way, I saw the the things they have the bell keys on. That's a nice big thing. I think that's my business but idea of a thousand points of light. I really liked it. By the way, have a version copy of Uncle Bronset right. You may use it if you want. Are you serious? I swear to God if I played it one time. Really? Not all the cuts. I will bring it by the morphe really want. Excellent. That's fantastic. Unless you've already got it on the sort of being sent them will bring it. Well no, if you come by first believe me, it'll that'll be great. We can have some people do it while we're on the air. Okay. People just like the other place. They got people walking up and down the hallway. They are doing nothing. You know, we don't know who they are. Hey, how are you? I really, this isn't like 273. I'm probably going to have a little talk about like worse than 273. Hey, let me tell you it's great over here. This is like there's some real living and breathing people here and fuel me even speaking. I said, all the talk. Everyone's putting you down about Rick Weaver. I have to say I've listened to Neil since he was on AM and he was stationed at my voice and he's followed you. You've always played this consistency. You've always coined attention to faculty and never changes. He's a great announcer. There's no question about it. I mean, as far as he's socks or whatever, that's another story. What is a great announcer? Absolutely. But I do have something to tell you that you might not like. Uh-huh. Okay. I'm Saturday and I live. I started mording down a junior. Yeah. Okay. He was with the church ladies. This is true story. I'm Saturday and I was trying to river for being, you know, how crimping property is. And he was saying what she really needed was more down. He's junior junior. And he pointed to his crotch and that's for real. I'm not making this up. Are you serious? Are you serious? Junior junior once again, they've ripped off your line. Yeah. That board, man. He just got to never original thought. He's not. And also the same night. I watched the Jack Anderson special on the JFK assassination. And I finally put it in the middle. Oh, my glad you mentioned that, man. That was now Glenn had mentioned he sought on, uh, grass week. Well, I'm waiting. Yeah. No, it wasn't great. It was horrendous. The piece of crap I've ever seen was like that UFO show with Mike Feral. And it's like amateur in a head Marina Oswald on there. All of these, uh, these independent shows that they're putting together. Man, it's incredible. But the information was good. It was just was hot pod together for the. It was. I want, I want, when you calm down, listen to me. Johnny Roselli died in 1976. He got hit. Okay. That's 12 years ago. Now, if he gave all this information to Jack Anderson before he died, how come it took Jack 12 years to make these great revelations? Because Johnny was only just surface, so to speak. What? You just surface, you know, the old drum meal. Yeah, the body just threw up. I got you. Okay. Now, but seriously, I mean, I put it together when Dan Quill, compared himself to JFK. He wasn't that far up based. Because at this point in time, nobody knows the whereabouts of either of their brain. Yeah. Okay. Okay, throw. Thanks a lot. Have a wonderful day. And thanks for the record in advance. Oh, my. I told you. I thought that was a weird, uh, terrible. But there were a couple things I did learn. But it was awful. And anybody who has, I mean, this doesn't include you. But anybody who's been a student of the JFK assassination, you know, didn't learn anything from that show. I mean, that's all old material. Right. I'm not a student. No. Interesting. But I have not, um, I haven't studied it. Mm-hmm. But like on the edges on the fringes, something like it was pathetic. And then at the end of the show, there is, they were going out. And they showed all these pictures of a JFK running around and his bathing suit and his gym shorts. What was that supposed to be? Was that kind of like the beginning of a JFK skin flicker, something? What was that about? That'll probably be coming up next month with Jacket. And the way Jack delivered that show, the way he read the lines in it. But the way that was so pathetic, you know, real-est. Come on, Jack. It was like he was doing his, an imitation of his old boss, Drew Pearson. Wow. You don't remember Drew Pearson before. Right. I read a way before he was like Jack Anderson's boss. Well, like, well, Anderson was kind of shaking. Yeah. He was shaking it. I kind of a show I've been shaking too. Okay, let's go to Fort Laterdale. Hello. Nobody there. What is shame? I know that must probably be one of the best calls of the day. Got a mobile in Miami. Hello. Hi Neil, how are you? Great. There you're. You're going to do any sports announcing now that you're on IOT. I don't know, but, um, if I would answer yes, I'm sure there will be a lot of historical people in the building. But, um, let's put it this way. The possibility is open, OK? Would you like to do it? Yes. Because, you know, I don't know. You know, one of your new new listeners don't know how good you are at this stuff. or at the start. Well, probably they don't, but they will. And secondly, we'll put it on. I read almost every book you can read on the jab case thing when it first happened. Yeah. And you're absolutely right. There's nothing to do. Everybody has bought for years. It was the cube and the slash moth here. There's not, I mean, it was, it was one of the most boring shows I ever saw. Yeah. And he did have David Chimon. I don't know if you read that book or not. The one that I've been touting. Oh, yeah. You what? What's the name of that book? Contracts, Contracts, Contracts, right, Donna Marica. Yeah. The mafia assassination of JFK is the subheading. Is that a new book? Yeah. It's within the last year or so last year. I haven't read that. Try read everything ten years ago. Now the book is sensational. Okay. It's excellent. And he did have David Chimon. You want to run a couple of times. But other than that, man, there was nothing new on there. The interview with Marina. I think even a five year old kid could have done a better interview with Marina Oswald. It was pathetic. No, it really was. And if he read everything like I had, it's right after half of it. And then you knew how pathetic the war commission report was. Yeah. Oh, yeah. The theory has been coming out for years. It's like you say it is nothing new. It's like it's like it's tomato. How did you like tomato? How did you like Jerry Ford's performance? He's a bright guy, isn't he? Right. I didn't like the like the use. I know it's hard to do. I don't want to use the quote after it's the takes of place of all these. I mean, it was damage risk. You're terrible. You're right. I like to see you do some sports announcing because you're the best baseball and outs right over her. Thank you, sir. Take care. You're great immersion. Thanks a lot. All right. This has been a real-enirvating day, hasn't it? Uh-huh. Now they did take the razor blade, though, the sports department. Yeah. They did take the razor blades on a both sports department and this studio before we came on here. I think there's something symbolic about that. Anyway, 12 minutes after one at 610 WIOD, we'll come right back. Okay, easy. The highest is going down in half an hour. Tell us where. And when as you off the roof, it's at the door. Save your own high, busy talk. It's at the start. Give him this a big throw drop within Zinexon. It works on contact. So he'll get caught for a leap. You know, like a car syrup. Only fast. Show you. See? Here you see. No, talk. Well, such, I don't know nothing. Vicks throw drops with instant action because faster relief is better relief. Use his directed.

After a year of AM Drive at Guy Janet Classic Rocker WZTM, a controversial personality from the Neil Rogers as across the street. For mid days at News Talk WIODAM. Zeta General Manager Tim. You know I don't know. He would leave that he calls on you. And he thinks we're not going to mention his name on the old Tim Williams. Because he's got young children, what the hell is that after the with any stuff? And he's not a few big figure. Well, he's the general manager of two major market radio stations. He's a shocking that may be. And he thinks we're not going to mention his name on the air. But anyway, it's in print here. print here so I guess as a general manager Tim Lewis cited just philosophical differences but Rogers was a tad more direct calling Zeta management subhuman douchef. Oh right. So how does he really feel? And the end okay. Okay, and that great is nice. All those go easy on Bill Wise. Why would we have to go easy on Bill Bill? Is the greatest guy in the world? Anything we want to play. He said hey what's wrong with that? That's a team. Okay. Now who said? I hate to think of what he wants us to play. Okay. Who said that? We have to go. Who said that? We have to go. Who said that? You're pal. Rich Pankk. Oh that's called the ultimate groupie. And she's written. No, we're not going to do it. I refuse to go easy on Bill. Why is that? You want to rip him now? I'm not going to rip him but go ahead. I want to rip him. I'm spiked. I want to call him. He's like spiked. Spiked wise. Yeah. Sounds like a baseball player doesn't it? Spiked wise for Atlanta or the Red Sun? Oh. Okay. That's fine. Sounds good. Okay. One for each for each. Steve is in a building and he's going to have a usual butt bath here from 26 to 16 to 17. All right. And he promises us that. Well, that's a whole new guy. So the one of the local TV stays looked like Channel 4 to me. Channel 4. I write. Hey, listen. I know Channel 4 when I see him. Say hello to Anna as squeaked for us. Okay. Come on. I got a lot of friends over there at Channel 4. Okay. John, hand-rich. The week for the weatherman and Michael Puteney. And all my good friends over there. How did I leave Tony? How could I leave Tony? I don't need. I got a lot of buddies over there at Channel 4. At least I hope still. Anyway, I was starting to say about Steve. He promises that Rick will not be gone until at least the last hour today. Is that true? What's that? Always going to be on tomorrow? Oh, great. For all four hours tomorrow. And the Steve and the Rick are going to tell us about their male bonding tomorrow. Right here at here. It's going to be really exciting. Okay. 60.02. And let's take a call. This is our first call from Plantation. We need to be a hate call. Hello. Yeah, Neil. Plantation Larry. How are you? Pretty good. How are you doing? Very good. I want to wish you a lot of luck at WIOD. Thank you. And it's funny. I started picking up on FM. Mr. First time I heard John AFM. Are you serious? I'm just a little bit of a real fluer ready. And now that's good. Well, listen, you're starting a little boring today. Larry, so you've been in Florida long enough. How long have you been here? We're doing my third year in yesterday. Oh, three years. Man, after another couple of years, you'll learn to read your videos. You're still on the honeymoon. Don't believe all that crap Steve says about how he loves Miami. What a great town is. Is it a bush-leg douchebag town? It's like 50 years behind the time. So once you get used to what you'll fit right in, okay? Okay. And no one on the real land is all. All right. Here. It sounds like you're working on Larry. Okay. Did you wish it landed moving? No. It didn't shave it. Now. Good movie. You don't want to say it? Not not into John Lennon. You know, he's a pretty ugly guy. Well, I wish you a lot of luck at your two Glenn. And thanks. Okay. I'll be listening to you. Thanks a lot, Larry. I'll buy all of that Brian F.D. Now he must have needed contact to something. Because he was evidently obsessed with, I don't think it was with John Lennon. I think it was with the Lenin sisters. Is that what it was? I don't know. I don't think they got the story screwed up. Okay. Miami. Hello. You're doing pretty good. Pretty good. What's up, dude? This time, A.M. Caller. All right. Now listen, one of the things we have to do, we can just like we did a couple of years ago. We got to get all those F.M. Doosh bags back over to A.M. You know, I said all that stuff about A.M. being dead. And it was hovering. You know, it was an intensive care. But now we've given it a little transfusion. So now A.M is back to the place to be. I think it was the first time I've ever put my radio to A.M. Fantastic. How old are you, sir? I'm 18. 18. Perfect demographic. You got an IQ of over two. You sound like an articulate guy. Are you a good looking, sir? Uh, yeah, sir. Okay. Good. That's just what we want on this show. Well, listen, I'm only going to work my buddy John. Great. How's got how old is John? Oh, how old are you? 22. 22. Now he's a new A.M. Mr. also? Yeah. Great. Look at that, too. Right there on the first day. We'll go to the all-time at F.M. Fantastic. Yeah, we'll give it up that station for Suckers, right, sir? Yeah. Okay. Anyway, we're here with John and work, and we got a back going. It's going to play guns and roses on half. Uh, tomorrow. Hi. I don't have it here. I would play it right now. Uh, or if I had time we'd run next to an A.G.T.R. But they're busy busting the walls with a scoping. I'll make it. 20 bucks in this meal. Tomorrow, okay? Trust me. I won't let you down. All right. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Bye-bye. I was at incredible or what? Now, TV's here. Yeah, this must be a slow news day, is that it? Because they found those two bodies on the Julia-Tetal Cosway. And I think there's a tie-in between them coming over here. Uh, huh. Have they had to come to this? How you doing? I don't have it anyway. So what you mean? Okay. So anyway, Channel 4 is here. So those of you still sat there, they watched the local news. Those of you can't afford to satellite dish. Please, please, please, go right ahead. Take all the food you want, because believe me, we want to get it out of here before you know who comes and get sauce on historical. Okay. 147, and let's go to Fort Waterdale. Hello. Hello. How you doing? I'm going to say do Spag for Channel 4. Do Spag do Spag. Okay. Subhuman, Mung Brain do Spag. That's three times they got it on tape. They're rolling. Now you will be on the tube. Figure out, do you know if you're riding a harmer in the queen yet? No, but I guess the brissel on this morning. Or not, or is it? You know, I did not know until this morning that hermins in one room and McBeans and a Nauir. And they don't want much to do it. They don't want much to do it. They don't want much to do it. They don't want much to do it. Yeah, you know, I didn't know this. And I said, where's Skip? You know, and he says, well, he's in his room. I hope he doesn't come over here. You know, I mean, it was like, yeah, everybody's very friendly. Here's here. But it's all nice. The keep them in separate rooms like our news people are like in a totally separate part of the building. We can't see them or feel them. So or feel them. That's correct. You saw them. Believe me, sir. You wouldn't want to either. Okay. How you're girlfriend, Patty Murray. Patty doing, she's a little emotional today. But she'll be all right. She understands. Now I think I hope. I talked. Yeah, we met your little chat with Pat. We'll chat with her last week. Well, how are you in here one day for a few minutes? That's a real question everybody really wants to know is after I'm really ripping WOD. When they call. Exactly. Call them and everything. That's right. Now I'll send you over there. I get this to big box. Not well, that's part of it. Believe me. Everybody's got a price. But now they change the management. The assignment is long going on. I can't believe. And he was the one that really does screwing in, you know, the case of calmer and Sandy and the boy's his name, Maggiuri Sullivan. I don't know. People are really got a bad deal here and the current management will agree with that. They're not going to lie about it. They have no disagreement. So who do we take now? Bill wise is he the Bill wise and Mike Disney and brother Walt and all of these people are great. Well, good. So far. Well, I listen to Herman McQueen in the morning. So I turn over from them to here. So it works out good. Excellent. You're great American. Sure. And have a wonderful time. Okay. Thank you. Well, we had more tinkling today than in a long time. Everyone has been incredible. Steve said it's the honeymoon, right? Fault Sure. And a couple more days. It's casting me while Alan's back. We're still up. Said and we're as fall. Oh, god. I'm telling you, listen, Nick, we get any of those geriatric voices on here. You know what I'm saying? Like deep six. I'm doing basically drop dead and get rid of my right unless it's struggling. If it's the struggling lady, you'll get to recognize her the one that says, you're struggling. You're struggling. She's fine. I like her. I'm certain that. Okay. Let's take our last break here and make way. Can't is going to be a longer two with another one of those contract controversies. He's already got the guest warming up in the other studio with gloves on. It's 149 at 610 WIOD. Bruce Hoffman at 610 WIOD. Okay. 153 WIOD. Did I screw up there? Is there any other thing? I'll do that every time. Okay. I'll do that every time. That's fine. We're just a little inside stuff. I find it fascinating. We're commenting on this during the break that channel four, which is not really that far, but they're like downtown, you know? Yeah. And they came out here with a camera crew and everything. And channel seven, which is right back. Do or it. I'm sure they're listening as I speak right now. Okay. Our good friends over there at your hometown station. Channel seven hasn't come by. So like evidently this isn't a big enough news story. And Nick is writing a note on here. It says TV seven never comes here. Really? Do you think I thought it had something to do with me parking in that spot this morning? Yeah. They said Edman, Anson, on it. Yeah. I thought that was at the one they told away. That's Sally in the trunk. Yeah. The one that he still gives me fits. You do know that don't I know. Okay. Anyway, six minutes till two, we're almost at the end of the line. And let's get calls in here before we run out of time. Because these people we've made them wait a long time today. I don't know why for sure. But they better get used to it. And all you hand heads out there now. Listen, all you old AM listeners, you've got to spread the word. Okay. Because it's going to take a little time. We're going to get back to those days when we had some fun on the air. And we've had a good time today. I mean, this hasn't been, I mean, people have tuned it. So, well, what's this all about? You know, what does he do? Well, if you listen to day, you wouldn't find out because this is our first day back after a long, free day lay off. And it just, the way it is, okay. South Miami, hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you on air? Yeah, I think so. Sounds like us. Okay. I just wanted to welcome you to IoG. Thank you. And I listened to you for years. And you've been great. Keep up the good work. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you, Art-Susher. Thanks for the tinkler. I just want to ask you one question. Yep. Are you going to vote on an amendment 10? No. Vote no on amendment 10. What is too low in these fakers, these doctors, man? Wanted their way? Vote no, please. Okay, because we are all confused here and we just didn't know how to go. Cross me what I tell you, no on 10. Okay. I know what Claude Peppa says. Yeah, no on 10. Oh, put me a phone. Hold on a gimp for the amendment. Put. Put. Try to me. It's a bad deal. And even many of the doctors privately, they would never admit it publicly, but privately, they admit that that cap is ridiculous in its way too low and forget it. Okay. And not that I'm in love with the lawyers either, but let's take it a case. The doctors are just on their minds. Lauderdale by the C. Hello. Angry graduation is a family. I think if anybody is looking for you, I suggest they don't call WIO's. Your WCCA is I just did. No, what are they saying? Well, what they are saying is, and the receptionist, who sounds like a very nice person, indicated to me that she doesn't know where you went. Yeah. I think it was kind of fun. I wanted to see if they were going to play the game straight and say, obviously, he's no longer here. And the SC is a little bit, it's WIO. You're on a date that you didn't do it. Isn't that something? Talk about paranoia. That's fine. Well, it's paranoia, but I don't think it's too classic. No, it's not classic. And not only that, but I came to an AM station. I was on their FM. I came to an AM station that really isn't competing. I mean, people who listen to WIO of D are not going to be classic rock listeners. And I'm in a different time period. I'm not an morning drive. I'm on a midday, which so in no way shape or former, we competing with their FM. I had a stand in a still don't have the, they still don't have the honor to tell people, you know exactly where I am. Yeah, well, what do you mean there? That's tough. If they would have treated us like human beings, we might still be there. OK? Well, I can understand that, but we're glad that you're with IOD. And the week, we wish you all the luck and incidentally. Ah, yeah. You finally talked to me and you did it without hanging up on. OK. I have a seat in the back door, but, or you know, who this is, but you're a head of side talk to you. Thanks a lot. How about that? How about any of you who that was? I wasn't a chronic one. I don't know who it was. And he sounded OK. He sure did. Maybe he had, you know, was putting on a good ant for us. On his best behavior or something like that. Oh, wait a minute. Nick knows who it was. It says that was Bob in. Ah. Ah. Was it really? Ah. That wasn't the Bob. I know. I see. That's something we got to cure over here. Because he has, he has attacked all the stations, but this one, he's in fact more than all the other ones together. And we have got to do something about that. Bob from the Hopping. But he was on his best behavior. He was doing every call us again. OK, Bob? Lighthouse point. Hello. I want to speak to the bird. I don't call speak to no G. I want to speak to the bird. OK, so go ahead. How do you talk to the bird? Next to that G. Oh, thank you, my cat. Some birds. Oh, sir. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. I suppose to consider the source, right? Yeah. That's what your buddies from David. Yeah, right. So anyway, I guess I could call the club. I was gone today. Oh, thank you. Perfect. We only got about a minute or two left here. And I want to say this has been the audience has been really magnified. Like the last call, or they've been very nice to have. Absolutely. We just didn't have too much of that. Although I'm sure we'll have more and more days to come and realize. But every one of those is worth a couple of points. But tomorrow's election day, we don't want to sway you. We don't want to have any influence. We hope that those of you who are for New Caucus will go out in both seven or eight times. Although it isn't, you know, it's going to be, do I dare say it? It's going to be a Bush landslide. I hate to say that. And especially in the electoral college, it's going to be a landslide. You shouldn't take that for granted, though. And those of you who are going to have the courage to vote for New Caucus in Florida, which I think that's about three of us. We don't need you to. Okay, by all these redneck Yahoo's. I mean, there's nothing we can do about that. This is a New Interfile Redneck State. All we can do is get out there and vote. And of course, there are a lot of other important things to vote for too. That grave, that great race between Buddy McCann County and Mac, which is like choosing between death by hanging or the electric chair. And I guess, yeah, you just got to go with Maccay because he's the less malignant of the two. Barely. But boy, talk about our articulate. I mean, if that's the best of this state can produce for the United States Senate, what is that? Okay. And no one am in 10. And basically, you all know the rest. Okay. So, at a meantime, we thank you very much in the, you've been marvelous. And we thank the management here for making it so easy and for letting you sneak a little bit of food in and nobody got hostile or hysterical. I do see them lined up at the door now, though. I have a feeling that we're going to hear a little bit about that. But what you got to that, okay? We would feel like culture shock if we didn't get a little bit. At the end of the show. Okay, stay tuned for Steve. He's next with another one of his great contrived debates. Thanks for do caucus, blacks, for bush, and blacks who just don't give a damn about either one of them. Have a great day. And we'll see you tomorrow morning and 10 after Mike Reneri right here on 610WIOD.
