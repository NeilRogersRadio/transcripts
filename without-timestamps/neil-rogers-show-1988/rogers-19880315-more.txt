dropping the bucket. That was kind of fun, because we just did two seafood places back to back. It's a ten minutes after seven. Yeah, we just spotted him between them. Oh. Okay, like I said, see if you haven't said anything. Nobody would know in the difference. Of course, because our listeners are all about your morons, right? You're all about your dodo birds. You see what's going on out here? Just like before, there's a dog chill out there. Oh, yeah. And he's leading him straight. Not you follow him now. Come on, guys. Just leave him to the Santa Maria house over there. Almost little puppies are getting led to slaughter. I can't believe it. He put it from the SPCA is listening. You don't be here right away. And save a puffer Christ, okay? My God, I can't believe what's going on here today. Who the hell needs these damn colors? Just thinking town man, these people are going through this for 12. God for second years. You don't want to try what all these. Okay, let's try one. Okay, just for hell. Let's see if they can redeem themselves. You know, like a call in these games, whether you know, like they play hard to get. You could have a four. I'm serious during times when I've had my highest numbers. Like when I used to be on a night, there were periods of time when you think that nobody was listening. Because the people here are unfriendly, surely nasty and hostile, okay? But I think you're wrong, because I've run into people on the street. And they say they hear you say that. And they say most of us are in our cars. Hey, I don't give it to you. Last season. I don't give it to them, but they're excuses. Okay. And they're going to laugh. I hell of a lot more. What I have to say, then the subhuman douche bags on his phone. Okay. Now that's a good. All right. Now let me prove a point. Is this a subhuman douche bag or what? Hello. Hello. My name. Yes. Okay. That's all. Let me. I'm just going to say something. Yeah. What do you think of these with Dave County? What is my beef with Dave County? Who said anything about Dave County? Well, you didn't say no along. I was an effect that it's dead. And that it's crime written and infested that it's like a festering sewer. I have no beef with Dave County. I think you're wrong. Where do you live? I live on the beach. Oh, my. Am I am a beach? Yeah. The beach. Oh, my god. You've got to be pulling my leg. Aren't you? Are you yanking my chain? No. Come on. Get cereal. I'm going to get cereal. Get cereal with me, honey. You live on Miami Beach and you try to pedal us a song at a dance that's livable and it's a civilized place. It's a barbaric wasteland. I am pissed off at you. Good. I want to know what your beef is about people over 30. I was just a joke. Okay. That they have no sense of humor. Do you have any sense of humor? When's the last time you laugh? Probably the same time you had a good BM. Okay, get on it. Now see people on the beach. Okay. If they just get a case of ex-lacks over there, the beach would solve a lot of their problems. I watched a little bit of this movie last night on cable project ex. Yeah. And I said to big Dave, they have a special version of that for Hallendale and the beach is called Project ex-lacks. I mean, what the hell is her story? I'm pissed off at you. I mean, anybody lives on a beach deserves what they get. See like a festering sewer over there. Who the hell is she kidding? Well, call me Mr. exception as Glenn would say, Oh, you love that art. I have a good time. Have a good time. The women are Foxy and see what a wise idea it was. Take the uncalled. Yeah. I'm going to be doing a remote from the sea girl tomorrow. Okay. It's 713. Speaking of Foxy lady, here's Jimmy Hendrix on Zeta 4. I mean, he did not die from drugs, but we don't play Foxy lady doing. We do. Well, I don't want to play any Jimmy Hendrix. He's another one of those screamers like Springsteen and Joe Cocker, the same thing. Scream. That's some music, man. And yesterday rose played, We're all fit London by Warren Zivan. That's a great song. We're who was the London. It's like a novelty record. Okay. It's like something you'd expect to hear on tragic 102.7. On Halloween. On Halloween. Exactly. You said that that was perfect. It's about time you did something. We should play vehicle today by the eyes of March. Oh, isn't that cute? That's a great record. Let's not and say we did. Okay. All right. Good idea. We do have an open line in Broward at 7.7.9. 3.600. I just mentioned that. Just in Dine. Oh, it's hard to believe. 7.7. 3.600. Now maybe Dennis and Gary would you would like you to take number six next because it's collect. Okay. Are you called collect? Yes. Where are you called from? Boca. Boca. Okay. Let's run up a good bill here. All right. We did. Good. I hope so. Now I'm live and so. I can't even talk because I'm listening to you. You're seven seconds. What is it? I know. I know. I know. I'm a four and a half second delay. I'm a crack and I can't even listen. Yeah. And then you get here the second time. I'm not exciting. Now I forgot what I was going to say. Really? Yes. Well, I'm not going to cut you short because you can't collect. I want to run up a nice good bill on this. Okay. What's new, Neil?

Are you listening to anything that I'm saying this morning? I said these management people here are the cheapest people go. I wasn't talking about you and right away you're defensive and certainly in paranoid. Oh, I'm not. Yes, you are. God, all right. Because they say I can't collect an ACV yesterday except the charges. You are cheap. I don't want to talk to you. God. May as well was hopeless. It was a hopeless case. It was a hopeless case. It was a hopeless case. It won't have a conversation. She wants to just gig along a radio. Yeah. You can relate to that. Yes. I can. 7. 16. I can't. I just can't believe these people this morning. Like out of the clear blue. Like out of nowhere. And that's what this town is all about. Yesterday was borderline. Yesterday was okay. It wasn't. We got started. Slow but then it was then it picked up. It was all right. But this morning you can just from the from the get go as I say. I don't know who it is that says that. But from look at that. There's another look at that. It's the dog. The dogs are coming this way. That's good. That's good. Come right in here, man. You wouldn't be the only dogs in this building. I'll tell you that. 7. 16 on Zeta 4 and we'll take a call from Miami.

Let's give those numbers out just in case in date County, 6203600. And in Broward, 7793600. We're zipping right through the calls today. You notice how many people have responded to the fact that we're like borderline music intensive today. Right on the edge. Mm-hmm. Just the way I like it. Right on the verge, okay? So it's up to the audience. You know, let them decide. But you, as Army, can train you to do things in six months that you could never do by yourself in six years. Please, matter, hooking up a sophisticated telecommunications satellite system. Oh, right! The U.S. Army can train you to do the same thing in 20 weeks or less. Call your local recruiter for all of the day. Send light systems all hooked up and ready to go general. That's good boy. Now I know I'm going to get HBO show time and cinema action.

Mm-hmm. They like it. But much too nice on this show to the people. Okay, much, much, much too nice. It's about time to get back to the old business and just to let them have what they deserve in his time. Oh, they love it. Because they know that they deserve the punishment. Basically, this town is like a sword. It's like the end of the world. Like I've said before, if you took away the good weather, what the hell would you have left here? Even the red necks would get out. Wow. And now, yeah, exactly. That's exactly what they all would like to tailor a missionator somewhere. Where? 26 after 6. Ha ha ha. Powered, hello. Hey. Yeah. Yeah.

Twenty seven after seven on Zeta 4. By the way, Captain David, the next break there that lives potting scratch there's absolutely no copy for that. So forget it. Well, can't you kind of add a limit? No. We have nothing. When you have no address and you have no copy and you have no information, I really kind of doubted. Well, I could like after you're done talking about it. I could come in and at the end and say, look for such and such in the yellow pages. Look for this in yellow pages. Okay. Seven twenty eight on Zeta 4 and the date counting good morning. Okay. So I'd want to know. Nobody can really figure you out, right? I know. Whatever you're saying. Okay. If that's what you say, I don't know why you say it. But I am from Dave, Johnny. I'm overduty.

You sensitive and paranoid too? I'm not sensitive and paranoid, but yeah. How could you be calling collect if you live on the beat? Wait a minute, where are you calling from? Right now I'm calling from Boca, but I live on the Palpino. Oh, Papa Nobeets. That's even worse. What? Oh, my God. Talk about Blue here. Yeah, that's is that way, but that's only during the season. I mean. See, when I was a little kid growing up, I thought that only Superman and Captain Marvel had Blue here. And that's until I moved to South Florida. It's true. Well, it's, I don't know. You make it sound like everyone on the beat is all old and it's not the right way. I didn't say that, and I said I have the greatest sympathy for anybody out of the age of 100 who lives on a beat. Oh, you did say that. Yes, I did. That was my mistake for it. That's because we were trying to call on your pissed pants. Okay. Well, you see, you have to get all the pieces of the puzzle to put it together before you start rushing to judgment. Oh, I'm sorry. No, this is a list. This is the first time that ever listened to your show. Are you serious? I'm serious. And we motivated you to call on the very first time. Yeah. Isn't that exciting? Yeah, you got me really mad.

You know, play about 40 in a row. And that'd be great. It's different. I like it. Especially because the music is so good. I realize that's just by accident. Must be lucky. You know, really when you stop and think of it, how hard is it to program good music? I hate to keep getting into that over and over again. But isn't really all it hard? Some people seem to have heard. I'm happy to notice. Oh, God. I can't believe you said that. Well, but I'm sure glad you did. Anyway, hey, listen, what they all can I say. You know, I know from nothing. All I know is a bunch of old-rowed orbs and records. And I'm a dottering old man. And I don't know all these good like ACDC and Queen.

It's right in the other end of the building. Oh, is it? Yeah. Well, the reason I say is because they did a real real, uh, innovative thing that's bringing you over to FM and they did. I'll tell you, come on home from work in the morning. It's a real jewelry listening to you because you just, you bite me out. Great. Uh, early enjoy your show too. Uh, I found a mine line. It was telling me about a place called the Rascal house. Yeah. Don't ever go there, sir. No? Don't ever go there. Why, sir? Because you'll just be, uh, you'll be overwhelmed by the barbarians online, sir. And that is a really bad thing. What, uh, what was he, what was he telling you about it? He just said they had really good corn leaf there. And it was, it was young. The whippersers were like 70 and older. But yeah, if, if you're willing to eat in a barbaric atmosphere with a bunch of hundred year old people standing online for an hour and a half falling down from heat prostration, and I would suggest that's definitely the place for you. You're just there, you're just there. I'm serious. I'm serious. Well, what would be a good place? A good place for what? Just someplace to go. It's not real crowded. Just something good. You know, something has good food in the decent atmosphere. Yeah, how about McDonald's, sir? It's, uh, what is it? All over the estate. There's hundreds. Well, 745, I can't believe that call. Can you? That's a good food. The guy who loads up the machine is in the building. And I was wondering if you want me to get you some of those. Yeah, one of those great, real-parmary Johnson, which is for the scalloped potatoes and the can. Yeah, I love the one of the can. It says in their own juice. I like those mouse meat parmesan myself. Those are my favorite. 745 on Zeta 4 that he arrangers Tuesday morning show and these calls today on a scale of infinity have been minus. A oral geobals. Hello. Good morning, Neil. Yes, sir.

What, what would I do with the jimcom or poster? For a guy who's six four, he carries a water gun, believe me. Believe me, jimcom or is about as exciting as a dead frog in heat? I'm really, really. Yeah. Listen, one thing I heard Lee Fowley yesterday. He was pretty good. He was okay. When he does the funny show, he's decent. Now when he does those polls. Yeah. I'll take you to the police.

Yeah. AQH. Q this. Did you talk to him about that we started at 10 of six? No, he doesn't want that. He just assumed give that 10 minutes up in exchange for the other 10 minutes. But that's not what happened. Did you know that? Well, no, I figured as long as we were here, why did he not give us, give ourselves a break. Okay. I hear he wants us to do like 10 minutes starting at two in the afternoon and then we leave again. And then you're going to do four to six. Four to six. Did you get the memo on that? Yeah.

Hey, well, we started rally against the FCC. Yeah. Yeah. That's a bit of an idea. What an original idea that is, sir. Hey. I mean, it works for Howard. Oh, yeah. Howard really did the wonders with the FCC. Yeah. How was it? Do you spag, okay? I wanted you to get him phone with him and tell him that in person. I begleited to him that. Oh, we call him up because they won't put us on with Howard. He's afraid to talk to me. That's why because his friend Mitch up there keeps screaming out the calls. Don't tell him that it's you. Yeah. Who are we going to tell him it is, sir? Divine. Hey. I, for all you know, I could have been anybody. And you got me on. What does that mean? That means that just caught him up.

Well, this guy, I'm telling you to consider yourself special. Yeah, that figure is, yeah, that answers a lot of questions. Yeah. Yeah, that sounds like something. Why are you dragging on us, Neil? On who? On the grill. I can't say on the air. All right, Neil. All right, Neil. Okay, guys. Take care of yourself. We'll get that out of here. I can't find Howard's number. Maybe I threw it out and discussed it. Yeah. Our last attempt to get a hold of the highway. I'm wasting the time. It was a waste of time, because I do Spagmitch wouldn't put us through. But you do have any other interesting numbers there? No, I'm not going to call you any of these people. None of those people are. Wonder what this is. Oh, God. I don't have a tape in here. Really? Oh, no. You won't need to take for this. Just keep your finger on the button. Look, the gates opening by itself. Wow. Why it's off? Boy, the technology and I have. It's just... There's nothing else.

Michael Mitchell said that Jackson was suffering from a sore throat and that ticket holders will get refunds. Monday night show originally had been scheduled for Saturday, then postponed because Jackson had a cold. Oh, poor Mikey, huh? Yeah, he did perform on Sunday night at the arena. I wonder if any of that ties in with the untimely passing of John Holmes. A wine country high school has hauled a 10 year tradition of giving commemorative wine glasses at the senior ball because of a campaign against drug and alcohol abuse. Students at Livermore, California will get bud vases instead. Hey, bud, but the plan may backfire.

Clear and cold tonight down to the 40s tonight and believe it or not, it's 53 degrees this morning at Zeta 4. 7.53. 7.55 on Zeta 4. Got a question for you. Got several questions for you. Have you ever been turned down for a loan? Yes. Have you ever been denied a credit card? Are you unable to get financing for new car or home or both? Well, once. Have you ever been told that the bad credit rating will stay with you for seven years? Well, I was told I had bad breath. Well, that happens to be true, but it's not necessarily true about that bad credit rating. In fact, if you've had bad credit, okay? Okay. Got some good news. Good. I found our real tape and now we can start being funny. Okay. Now the show starts. We've got to see the reason we didn't really do much of a show this morning. We haven't really taped to do the promo for tomorrow. Okay. And now that we have a real tape man from now here on until 10 past 10, it ought to be phenomenal. Okay. It ought to be sensational. So not the good callers can start calling in and kept the napkin stop feeding back at a mic in there. We'll get to do a show now. Yeah. And now we got to do a real show. Not a pain in the butt. Okay. Let's start with Pembroke Pines. That should be a good starter. Hello. Oh, yeah. That's what a man has been always says to me. They see you're the last smart ass wherever we're going to hire. And I pull out my message that I got really used. Yeah. I pull out that message I got from John Donovan at WABC in New York yesterday. And they say, oh, we're just kidding. We're just kidding. Have another hot dog meal. You know, come on. Are you really fond of this? Well, that's good. Have an nice day. Good. Get some rest. Come on. Yeah. Really enjoy it. Thanks a lot, pal. I want to turn on my recorder and try to catch a rest of the shows when I get it. I want to wake up later on this. Good. Thank you. Okay. What's that? You talk about your while, okay? And I call you the next time of down there. You bet you. Let's talk until you have a good one now. Bye bye. Good guy. 28 past eight on Zeta 4. We have an open line in the Broward. 7 7 9 36 hundred. See the thing that I don't understand. We got all these people want me to call them. Mung brain and douche bag and moron. What is that all about? I love it. Another would say believe that honesty is the best policy. I don't know. I don't see any food in this man's hands. Do you not even going to identify him by turning around? He was supposed to come in here this morning with his honorable feast. He was supposed to have this place just hopping with the... What about what? What did that have to do with anything? That was a celebration. That was before the book came out. Oh, and that. You know, isn't that interesting? Like he had the hot dog vendor here for the book? We didn't... I can understand. I can understand if they brought Joey Hotdogs when the book came out that would fit. Okay? It would be like an editorial comment. Are you making enough noise in there and you think? My God. Listen to that. Here. Let's do it in stereo. There you go. So I didn't know that was our celebration. Oh, the hotdogs. After the fact. I didn't know. Oh, he could have stopped by Tom Thumming. Got us a little. Something. Good name. Pigs and knuckles. Like some of those pickle eggs. Anything. But they just don't care here. This is your... We don't give a damn station. The... And here's a lot of people. We don't give a damn hoop. Right? Here's some traffic. Okay. Go ahead. We care about those folks out on the highway. We sure do. We care about all your poor bastards out there driving. But that's the way it goes. So commercial... Most of these are, bro. Commercial Boulevard approaching old Dixie Highway. There was an accident earlier. They cleared it up with the traffic still real bad. Eastbound. How unusual. And Shouthbound, I-95, is backed up from an earlier accident from Oakland, all the way to Cyprus Creek Boulevard. Mm-hmm. And... The Turnpike, North and South, um, bound lanes of the Turnpike, New Orleans, Beach Boulevard, and the Hollywood Boulevard, toll booths. Most of those lanes are going to be closed today, because they're repaving it. Oh, yeah. He's speaking of WABC. It just dawned on me. Maybe the guy was calling me for a reference on somebody that we all know. Yeah. That was it. Yeah. That was it. Because they would never hire me anyway. They've been messing with my mind for about five years up there. And they're never going to hire me. Because I, you know, won't, I won't stand in line. The land online. The look of relief on that man's face. Oh, yeah. It's just incredible. Well, it could be a job offer. You never know. Okay, just... But it also could not, seriously, it could be a reference on this guy. And I-I just want to put it- How do I put it, delicately, if they're calling me for a reference on him? I wouldn't be buying a house. I wouldn't be running a duplex. I wouldn't be moving to Fire Island to Fireham, okay? 831 on set of four. We have a caller in Miami. Buenos dias. You're morning, Neil. First time calling. Great. I really enjoy your show of wine. Thank you, sir. I'm a little nervous here. That's the idea. Well, I was wondering if... You could help me with a particular problem I have. I doubt it, but go ahead and give it a shot. All right. I'm going to turn on this child show. Okay. And it's pedigree with papers in the home of yours. He's only six months old. And we can't keep him out. We're trying to find a home spot. And it costs you about 300 bucks. And we're going to give him a length. But we want to give him more weight. If somebody is going to give him a good home. But, well, you scared of some of the people out there. You know, with these oldies, uh, said to me, I'm retrules and uh, brave, uh, dog burning. Yeah, we got a house right up on a corner here. I think I'll take him off your hands. Oh, really? Yeah. Well, we'll be right on my way. I don't think that burn him up. I might slice him up a little bit. Oh, it's got. Well, that's what we don't need. Uh, and I was gonna make it. Maybe you guys are with it. In fact, in fact, if the house on a corner right outside our gate here, they give no meaning to the expression hot dog. Yeah. Well, I was wondering if you could help us a lot. Uh, what do you do? What do you mean, help it? Otherwise, we're going to do not pick giveaways on the air. Next, what we do. Next, what we do is we'll be doing lost and found animals on a show. So I mean, your intentions are great, but you really think that we're going to give away the dog? How would we do that, for example? In other words, you give us the number to captain Dave Off the air, and if somebody wanted to dog, they would call him and he would give them the number? Something like that. Well, I would be good if he was in the studio. I have a, there's got no idea where to hell you went this time. Wait, it's a good thing I got this apple. No, I'm going to do it if it'll ever come back. Let's just see how much time we can kill before he comes back, okay? I think I got this apple. This is our little celebration. Listen, I just want to tell you that. I'm definitely going to my strong words and my vocabulary now. I think I'm realising that those people out there do have a lot of mong brains out there. Yeah, I mean, say that again. But anyway, speaking among brains, where did this guy go all of a sudden? Did he go into an eating frenzy or something? The minute he saw bulge, your company would know food. He went to the machine diving out there to the machine. You can bet your life on that. You can bet on it. You'll come back. You'll be eating when he walks back in. Okay, listen, hold on. No, don't go away. Hold on, will you? Okay, I'm going to put you on hold. Don't go running off now. I'm really upset. Okay, hold on. Thank you. Okay, now that's online too. 26 till nine on Zeta 4. If we can remember that long, it'll be great. Seriously, this, he may be trying to set a new record now for being out of the studio longest time. That is a lot of duties. Like what? Where, I think that's one of the interesting, everybody else has got all these damn questions today. That's one of the most fascinating questions. Where does he go and what the hell does he do? Where is he? He's busy at the machine. First of all, it's time for a break. That's number one. There he goes. He's putting a hair, a frantic hair. There he is. He just came back from a roux, I think. Okay, now listen, there's a guy on two who would like to give you his phone number. No, thanks. Well, that's beside the point. You're going to take the guy's number on two and he's got some stupid dog that he wants to give away. Ah. I'll come on now. The guy's a good guy. Or nearly we don't do this because it's really it's juvenile and it's embarrassing and disgusting, which means it fits the station perfectly. This is like what they do when I OD is. Yeah, we're going to do lost dogs and cats and art varks. Hey, that's Apple sounds really delicious. I don't think so. I don't think so. I don't think that an Apple on top of the postage. You have to be the answer to my problem. Hi, James. So anyway, if you take his number, if you'd be kind enough online to just write it down if anybody wants is interested in the dolog. Are you going to do it sometime this week or what? Yeah. Okay. 836 on Zeta 4 and I think while he's taking care of all that business, like BTO is that fine, and we just play that little while to come about that. We'll take a little break and then we'll come back right after. He's paying no attention. He's paying absolutely no attention. He's an all. Think in the number like you ask him to. What was that number again? Okay, we're going to take a break now and then what is he? You want me to take the phone call or. Okay, well, it's just forget to break okay. No, okay. No, let's forget it. No, let's forget it because I know you can't walk you to banana and chew it. I'm at the same time. I get through a little foggle in there. Yeah, water fees related to Jimmy Carter by the chance or Chuck Doodle. That was nice. That was a little bit interesting. Well, we'll bring him back again a little bit later on. Okay, Mr. Green jeans in Miami. Hello. Yeah, man. Okay. We have a good time. I think I had a great time in Vegas. I'm going up to the public next weekend. Fantan, listen, did you hear my restaurant that I recommended? No, what is it? Okay, I'm serious. Did I get tagging food? Yeah. Okay, now there's a place. It's not on a strip, but it's very close. It's on Sahara Drive. And it's called Romeo's. It's a very elegant Italian restaurant. I'm telling you the food is so tremendous. And the service is phenomenal. And you'll love it. It's called Romeo's restaurant. It's a 2800 West Sahara. 2000 West Sahara. I'm telling you, it's really it's. And you don't have the problem like you do in the restaurants on a strip where it's all jammed up and crowded. And you know, that gets real old after a while. And it's all in about it. Listen, about that guy that called it had that Chao Chao? Yeah. I'm kind of interested because he I got this big ol' labitor. And he likes to eat them like for breakfast. You know, kind of Chao Chao would be just a cow. You know? Yeah. Like puppy Chao. And something like that. So, you know, I'll take the number for that. Okay, great. And, um, obviously, yeah, the leisurelet work, pants with really big pockets. Yeah. Because those things are Monday. He says, you know, you know, you're talking about how much you like to stones. You said, I really feel deeply for the stones. Yeah, that could be it. Yeah. You know, you might have something there, sir. Yeah. However, federal law prohibits us from expanding on this conversation. Okay. Have a nice day. Bye bye. And take good care of Lassie. Will you please? Eight forty four on Zeta four in your doggy dog station.
