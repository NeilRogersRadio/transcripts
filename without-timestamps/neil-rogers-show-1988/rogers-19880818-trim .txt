Oh, that's good. It's the Gaf King. Let's go G-O-F-F. P-K-O-F-F-The Gaf King. Are you locations in the Bay Area? Five. Wow. But we don't have time to get them to the Bay Area. And Atlanta, I think there's two ways to go. Now it's your turn. Well, speaking of food, it appears slicing pizza has an occupation. That has to be correct. This is shocking. Don't you think this is shocking? Uh, hazard others in the one posed by sharp blades and a letter to the New England Journal of Medicine. They always keep up on stuff like this. A doctor describes a case of what he calls pizza cutters, paul. The doctor? Are you suffering from this? The doctor says a weakness of the hand muscles comes from pressing the handle of a roller blade pizza cutter into the palm. Among other things. Now, don't you think this is what Wendy was suffering from this morning instead? Pizza cutters, paul. He's exactly. Uh, his prescription for relief is simple. Don't do it. Exactly. Stop. Use another kind of cutting. And everything will be fine. And what was that again? You go to the doctor and say, every time when you go in, yeah, at all, a little, uh, Hiny Youngman joke. He going to the doctor, you say, don't care. It hurts what I do. The doctor says, well, don't do it. And see, in this case, it turned out to be fact unbelievable. It's 923 now. And what are we going to play the music? We want to play this next. We'll play Tainted Love for you right after this. Great. Neil Rogers, the rock and roll monster. Is eight or four? Boy, that sounded great. Saw Saw with Tainted Love for you this morning that we just got today. That of course is from January 82. And is the record that's meant the longest time of any single in the history of Billboard starts, 43 weeks on the chart. And it only went incredibly to number eight. Captain Dave. Only went to number eight. And, um, there it is. They're from Britain. Saw Saw. As we mentioned earlier, the song that was chosen by Rolling Stones, the number one single for the past 20 years was that is factoring the stolen runs. That's a good song. That's one of the shows. And that's why one of my favorite oldies of all that's coming out in the next edition, the top 100 singles of the past 20 years. Wow. We have another first time caller this morning. This person's in Hollywood. Hello. Hello. You're a first time caller. Yeah, I think I'm your youngest loyal zatal listener too. I want to have a contest. How old are you? I'm 20. Is that, is that? No, no, we hear from teenagers. Oh, yeah. Oh, sure. And then also people love to put their kids on the phone. We've had some of that this week. Three year olds and eight year olds, you know, and oh, shock. Yeah. Oh, well, well, I can say that I like to say it a lot. Well, why do you think it's unusual that your age is decreasing? I don't know. I don't want to people that are 20 years old that are listening to Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob. Yeah, I know. I know. And our research shows that a lot of women also in your age group, 18 to 24, listen to gloves and joy and stuff like that. That's Serpy Sackern music for some odd reason. You know, some of your girlfriends doing that? Yeah. Yeah, a lot of them that are like, in their 20s. Yeah, why is that? So you know what that makes people think about, you know, the stereotypical thought is that your airheads. You know, when you hear any content, all you want to hear is like, mindless music, you know? Not me. I like to say that before you guys came along, though, I listened to Waxi. Uh-huh. Boy, those guys aren't they? I know. What you're not, you know. They're awful. You every minute you hear that cow going back. And I listened to them a couple of weeks ago when I was on vacation. Mm-hmm. And they talk and talk and talk and talk and they never say one thing ever. No. Never. Just babble and talk like for hours. And nothing has ever said. Have you noticed that? Incredible. Well, I'm glad to see your an exception. You figured it out, you're listening. That's great. You should be congratulated. I love you though. It's great. Oh, great. Well, I'm so glad you called and spoke to us this morning. Well, wait a minute. Don't kick me out. Oh, I'm not. I'm not. I was wondering, what are you guys going to have a pink soy weekend when you're going to have, you know, like you do, the Beatles? Really? I don't know. I ask her right after the Archie's week. Yeah. Johnny said right after we do the Archies for a weekend. Yeah. Now, I'll suggest it to our Prawn Director Rose Fulcher. Yeah. Do you guys know Jack Leaverman? Sure. Yeah. You see a Joker what? I think so. Don't you? Yeah. I used to work for him. What? What a gas, right? Wow. When you were a teenager. Yeah, I did, but then recently, not too long ago, I worked for him. Yeah. It's so, oh, like good. So, what do you do now? Oh, I am, I am, sir, of whom. Oh, well, somebody has to do that. You know, it's important. It's important, really. It's important, really. It's important, really. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. It's important. I do said, Kevin Dave. Oh, no, Captain Dave. So, you have to say it correctly. You know, I kind of have to court a sort of mumble that. That's the Dave. I kind of have to mumble. You know, we got this letter today. Someone, a photo of us. And it's addressed to Mr. Bird, Neil Orgland. Yeah. And that's something. Well, I'm serious when, very sincere when I tell you, I'm glad to have you as a listener. Okay, no. All right. I'm going to share it. Should I do you want to? You want to freeze at us? I want to say to sure that you know what I drove around for a half an hour trying to find this place one day just to get a license plate. Finally, one of my friends had an extra one and they gave it to me. You couldn't find us? No, well, you guys were going to be at some, oh. Anna, some, I don't know what it was. I don't drink, but I was going to go there just for the license plate. Oh, yeah. Well, hmm. I have to think about it, okay? Mary, I don't know what to tell you. I don't have any shirts with me right now. Yeah, right. I'll be over there in about five minutes. I'm hoping to watch. I honestly don't have one, but if I did, what kind would you like? You want one that just says, I love data for on it. Oh, a Zeta four shirt. Well, we do have those. We do have Zeta. What would I say? Well, I was thinking about the unbelievable shirts. Oh, no. I don't have our pictures. I don't think we want a regular Zeta's shirt. Okay. What should I tell her, Captain? If I know you don't want to deal with this, this show's just growl. You're with it. Did it really? Yes. Oh, okay. Sorry. See you later. Okay. Bye. Hey, I didn't realize that. Well, this calls for you. Hello? Yeah. Yeah, talk to Captain Dave. Look, this is a rock and roll station here. Now, don't play this computer early 80s battle. That was a problem. Yeah, we got rid of it was dead. Now, who would you rather talk to get me to the last lady or this caller? I think that is interesting. That is a little bit of touching go to it. Okay. You know, he's out of his mind, but it's really showing. She's showing for a t-shirt. She's groveling for that. Okay, well, then you talk to him. You deal with it. No, don't get sirling all that. Just that phone calls love about three minutes too long. That's all. So what can we do for you? Wait, well, look, you got to play. You know, I have to admit it is a step in the right direction. At least it's not one of those, one of those tunes. They just play over and over again. So, you know, the legs fall off of it. Now, we told you why we played this record. It was a pretty long period of that much. That's number one, but also we played it because it was, it had the longest longevity of any record on billboard. We thought it was just shows the stupidity of the American people. Well, I don't judge the American people. We reflect the American people. Oh, Danny, didn't want to go work for why 100 or something. Unlike why 100. Ah, shoot them. You deserve that, Jack. Is that it? It's called good. It's going on pretty long time, you know. Kind of grinding. You guys could do. You know, there's a certain band that, at all the rock stations, are too wimpy to play and you guys could break new ground there. What is there we go? Living color. Imagine if you put Jimmy Hendrix in Led Zeppelin. And you had a singer like, good, it's ready. God, you'd have culture clash. That's the total. They can play three styles. Who is it? Is that the group living color? Yeah. Living color. Well, I have to check it out and produce it. Yeah, well, maybe we'll check it out sometime. All right. OK. Later on. Now, what was your rather here? Tainted love, which was a smash, or what was the name of that? Living color. Yeah. I don't like it. I'm really concerned. I'm going to stick with the hits. It was only on the chart for 43 weeks, but I guess no, to be right. There was a reason that we played that. I still like. Criticized. What a bad that we didn't have the long version. Yeah, we'll work. Please, everyone. So you got to please yourself. That's right. That's right, baby. Well, this show, this has been a battle like I have never been through. It's 9.36 will do this. And then we'll continue to slug it out. Today a new Gondris Grill featuring blocks from Steve Wood, the who and the Rascals. Tomorrow, Friday, it's all requests led Zeppelin on Gondris Grill at noon. Here on Zeta 4. Now, Johnny tells us there are a lot of this. This is an old one. Today is the last. That's a little bit sad. Yeah. OK, start over. This show has been, I have never been amazing through anything like this in my entire life. Because you're in a different studio. No. Not just that, but we had like somebody who screwed up the spots to the spot. Lots are all screwed up. Just everything. Every thing. Normal now, but we've earlier this morning. It was a lot. You people have no idea what a nightmare we have been through today. Put the show together for you. And if we're in here tomorrow, I'm going to say it again in public. And I'm sticking with it. I don't care. Nobody's take this personally. If we're in here again tomorrow, it's going to be all music. I'm not doing a show here again because they promised me. Well, we do 16 at a row. That. Yeah. We'll do 16 at a row tomorrow. Well, they're 16 billion in a row tomorrow. Promise me we would be back in our studio. So we could do the show. Now, what's it look like? And there's a time. It's come along. They worked till two in the morning. I'm moonsheds. So they're definitely working on it. There are a lot of set up spots in here. So some of them. Yeah, it's right. We've got to give them incentive. Or they won't get a ready. You know how people are. If we don't say anything, it won't be ready. They've got to fix that noise in the one with the buzz. Oh, I like this. My kids. Great. But I mean, you can we hear that other one again? Yeah. Oh, yeah. There's the radio. You can hear the AM. Oh, good. We need it. I think we can get the current temperature for it. There's another first time caller. Hi. Hello. Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing? How come you never call? Because I listen on and off. I find this show. I don't want to sound, you know, for radical. But listening to Neil in the morning is like listening to what down it junior in the morning. I mean, it just it wakes me up too fast. And everybody complains, but everybody wouldn't miss a word. Yes, that's right. Got to see what is going to come out of this man's mouth next. Yes. What could he possibly say next? They will you love to hate him. Yes. And I have a couple of requests. Oh, I'm thank you for playing. Tainted love. I had never heard the full thing before. Where they go and to where the door was going. It necred. It is excellent. I don't know what's happened to them. They should have been with him. I know that was the only one. You're right. They should. This is a long shot. I've never seen a guy in Neil's files. Somewhere to see had magic count by the folks. I don't believe so. I've never seen that. Nobody has it. It's a beautiful for. Nobody seems to have it. Now, Johnny has it at home. How about if we haven't bring it in. We'll play it for you tomorrow. That would be great. Oh, I am always frustrated with any of the three major stations. And you know who you are. When you play the golden slumber is metley by the Beatles. I know you guys hate dead air. But all three of you major people have been guilty of omitting the her Majesty's pretty nice girl bit. I'm not sure what about ten seconds a day. But still. That's excellent. Uh-huh. I'd love to hear it. Okay. Now what time do you get up in the morning? Oh, usually about six thirty. Okay. We'll play magic town for you tomorrow about then. Okay. Maybe you can wake up to it. It's like six thirty five four. Okay. Thanks for calling. Bye bye. North Miami. Hello. Now they're there. I know they're there. Get the one and six. Okay. Hi. Hello. Yes. Yeah. Well, I like that song. Did you? Did you? Yeah. Did you remember it? Yeah. From when I was in seventh grade. I remember everybody loved it back then. I really liked it back then. I haven't heard it since I was in the middle. That's why we played it. That was the two reasons we played it because nobody plays it. And because it was the longest record in history on Billboard. Well, I'm 17 now. I must have been like 10 months. Yeah. It was really, I liked it. But I was running if you could play rock music. Do you have rock music? Ah, boy. I don't know. I just don't know. You know, we're not in our usual situation. I don't know. I'll see if we can check it out for you. You know, if I'm one in this. Oh, is that great? Yeah. That's a great song. Great record. Yeah. Well, let's show you look up rock music in the book. Oh, they didn't do anything. But it's on. Okay. We'll see if we can do it for you. Maybe tomorrow. Well, how about some more music from that age? From that period. Yeah. And what we'll see what we can do. Okay. Thank you. Good to hear from you. Okay. Bye bye. So we'll show you. We got a plantation now. Hello. I'm in a San Francisco. I'm in the hospital. He'll jump in the chair. What? I can't believe that. Yeah. You know, we're doing a lot of reminiscing this week. A lot of playing stuff in the past. And that one went back further than anything. I think. Boy, was that a great call? That one went hard. There's always somebody out there tapin isn't we're in it. Yeah. It is. Right? Yeah. Now, this call is Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Hi. How are you? Good. I think I really redundant now. But I call to say I have a vote for Candid Love. She likes Candid Love. Very much. Yeah. When they're great to hear it again. It was. You get like you say. Never. Never. And I remember it. And I remember liking it then. I was putting my makeup on. I started dancing. It was great. Yeah. Good. Yeah. That's how you played it. What is it? Yeah. It wasn't too bad. Yeah. Well, great. Yeah. I haven't spoken to you all such a long time. Yeah. It's been nothing but different voices this whole week. Yeah. The last time I called you to bring back to Miss Dante. It was during their formula. All the formula. Now, did you. That was that was last Christmas. Yeah. I hadn't moved yet. And I called up and you got it right. Yeah. Yeah. What an amazing that works so well. So if you know something, I have to tell you then I started taking the pill. And now it's not right anymore. Yeah. You know, I read something someplace. There's variables that you, you know, I don't know how you'd figure them in. And now I read somewhere that said that the reason American women's breasts are large are now. Then they've ever been as because of birth control pills. I did read that. So what you're saying is that's true, right? Yeah. It could be. But then again, you have to be like a downside to it too. Uh-oh. I think there's a lot of physically fit women who do aerobics and run. And I know that that tends to streamline you. I see. That's my drift. Yeah. I don't know why I'm so nervous talking to you today. I don't know neither. It's just me and it's my suit. Yeah. I've been a little surly today, but I'm not surly at you. You know, this is true. You put your foot down today. Oh, you bet. You have to do it in this person. It's like Neil says. And this business, you have to do it because if you know just as well as you know, you know that if I don't, it won't be ready. Well, I have to say, I don't think it's just that business. I think it's the little axioms of life. Yeah. You have to do it. Yeah. There are situations when people that push you and you got to push back, because you're going to get pushed down. Yeah. That's absolutely correct. Yeah. And if I don't threaten, you know, they won't get it done. There'll be like no reason. They'll have no reason to get it done. They won't carry, you know. But if they know and I will stick to this, I'm going to tell you that if it's not done, it's going to be all music tomorrow. I don't care. You know? What's okay if you bring more things out of, I don't know. I don't want to stay out of the closet. Oh, it'll be great. It'll be like painted love. It would be lots of fun. All it'll be great music. Trust me. I'm really, I do. I have every bit of confidence in the three of you's case to music. Yeah. And remember, we got Johnny Darkier. So it could be, it could be mind-boggling, you know? Oh, my God. So I remember him from like when I was there. Yeah, I just turned 33. Oh, I'm a girl from the QA and FUN days. Oh, my God. There's little like radios, there's little M radios that like plugged in the wall. And I had it by my bed. And I used to like put my ear right to it because we, you know, it was just everybody was always complaining about that kind of music back then. And I remember, switching back and forth between QA and FUN. And I was very, very, very remember all of this weird stuff that you guys have been talking. And so if I remember, surf, may you just like put it all the way to the end. Yeah, remember the station closest to your glove compartment. Nice said that it was like the, there was only a, a, a beginning of the second. That's correct. But I remember there was something called magic bus, and two. But yeah, but that was like an underground station. Recently, I went, when I was 17, they interviewed me on the air. About what? Well, my girlfriend and I used to call up, was a board in 17 and we graduated early. And we made herself, I was dirty down here. And she was Amara's name. Oh, my God. I used to call them up really late at night and talk to them about music in life and, you know, philosophy. I remember her. You, and I, Johnny says he remembers her. I'm John M. That I had this massive crush on. And we went down there. We got to get out and thrift shop specials. And he was in Goldland, and I was in Black Velvet. And we had like little beauty marks that we painted on ourselves and gloves and gloves and the whole mind yard. And we went down there and they interviewed us. Uh-huh. And I, we did this in the daytime. And I remember when we left my house, my father, which is about how to baby. Uh-huh. It's like breaking out. But it was, it was real fun, yeah. Now, do you know that the magic bus became club 94? I do. I know. It's unfortunate things are to happen. I guess it's what happens when you get all. Yes. That's, and we got to run, but we're going to play an all-f.t.t.t. F. you in jingle for you. Oh, thank you. Have a great time. Bye-bye. You're with WFU in 790. Where do music starts? Let's dance for it. I had less note. Amazing that she remembers, isn't it? I've got a problem here. What? I just, um, and at first I thought it was me. But I cannot find any news. I've done it all. And I walked over to the AM side. I've got a lot of people who are going to be in the same problem too. The only thing that you're finding is like 75% of it is Republican convention stuff. And as far as like the type of news we do, the bizarre, the bold. Yeah. The daring type of news. Okay. Do you have one story you can do? I've got like one. Okay. And I'll do, you do one. I'll look for another one. Okay. I'll do one. You do one, all right? There's absolutely nothing happened in today. I guess I got something I can do here. How do you say today? Just relax. It's on fire. It's on fire. No, no, no. Oh, no. Don't be here with us for the news, Candace. I'm closing for you. Ed, will you stay with us during the news? I certainly will. Okay. Let's get going, Candace. This is going to be a great news, Candace. Ah, in the middle of the bed. I can't wait to see what that. Well, in case you lost count, convention manager say about 50,000 balloon. I say 150,000 balloons will rain down after bushes, except in speech. They claim it'll be a world record for an indoor balloon drop. I think it will be, right? I think so after you didn't, you didn't have like a birthday party once, it was like 25,000. Cedar Point theme amusement park in San Duskill, Ohio is building what is built as the largest, fastest roller coaster in the world. That's a good story. Well, they magnum XL 200. It will go 70 plus miles per hour. Whoa. It will peak at 210 feet. Now after that, it's 156 foot hill. And 80 foot hill, two tunnels and smaller hills. Take you two and a half minutes and it should be ready for the 1989 season. Now, I see now, I guess I missed that one. That's a good story. It's a great story. It's a good one. And for the third time, I'll announce the birthdays today. Shelley Winner's is 66. Rosalind Carter, 61. Movie director Roman Polanski, 55, who's still not allowed in this country. That's right. I know. Robert Dredford is 51. Martin Mals 45. Actor dancer Patrick Swazie, 34. And Malco and half-tune. Yes. Malco and Jamal Warner. Theo is 18. And I've been a dare has been laid down. The gauntlet has been thrown down before me. I'm going to watch the concert. So you're a selfie? For the first time tonight. In this great ad. And it's the first time you've ever been with this during the newscast. And you're a selfie. I'm just learning how to move. I'm just learning how to move. I just need drugs to class here. You're a lonely tonight. You're a living on my... What? It's a great honor. Ed, would you like to go on that roller coaster? What kind of roller coaster is it going about a hundred and twenty-nine times? I think that guy that's really a problem is that you're going to build a great board. I think you want to build him. You know? Theo and all of the things together kept in days. Finally, I'm in the ad. You put me and you've churned me up. I think he's busy eating six hot dogs. I guess he can't go on the line too well. I'll never doubt meals opinion about things like that. I'm still searching. Here comes the snow. Here comes the snow. He'll be back Monday. Here comes the weather now. I think about much. Here we go. 30% chance of afternoon thunderstorms. Hi today, 92. 20% tonight. Looking pretty good. But then we do have a 50-50 chance again starting tomorrow. Right now, it's 81, my friend. It's 9-50. You want to know. Theo, watch us on the radio. He brings you all sorts of topics to listen to on your show. I need to ride high. Before six to laugh to 10. Hey, this is classic rock every day. You have a problem. It's so full of misinformation. You're not going to go to 10. 30. What's it? Before six to after 10. Maybe 10 o'clock in 30 seconds. 9. 57 means we have this. This has been the longest show we have been since we've been. I agree. This has been a battle royal. Mongo sleepy. I feel like a wrestler. I feel like there's been great till they made up for. Collars have been fine. Ed was wonderful. All they're doing the news with Ed was historic. Didn't make any sense at all. But that's natural. Now tomorrow is our last show. Neil will be back Monday. And the Peter Boulder is in the building. And I say again, if we are not in our old regular Neil Rogers studio tomorrow. Don't get it. It is going to be music intensive. Music intensive. I'm they shouldn't have put this through this anyway. And we've overcome. We made it sound good. You know, when Greg goes on vacation, Noodles play music all week. He's a disc Jackie. Sell down backwards. And does this mean that I have to raid the closet and bring in Just stack each side. He better be prepared. I want you prepared. I don't want you to have that contingency plan. Maybe we should maybe we'll do it anyway. Because it's Friday. Maybe you know, if we are in the studio, maybe we'll do some of that. We'll play to music this morning. We'll play all music tomorrow. Now for back in the regular studio, we'll do a regular show. If we want song and one bit, one song. Maybe something like that. Maybe something like that. What am I playing for?
