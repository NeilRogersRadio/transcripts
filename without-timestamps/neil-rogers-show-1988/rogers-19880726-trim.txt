Tell me, is it a Met's 3 to 2 cartonels? Me, the Pirates 5. One to Met's are still by default two games ahead. Giants beat the Dodgers 3 to 1. American League, it was Yankee's 3 Milwaukee 2. Twins 5 to 104 Chicago 6 Seattle 5. Boston 1 to 12 for the Royal Red Sox 2. Tuckers nothing and California 2 Oakland 1. So he treats a half game behind New York. Boston's only a game and a half back. That's it. That's the snowboard from your friends at Zeta 4. Here are those numbers now. They had about 6 to 0, 3600. That's 6 to 0, 3600 and a Broward 7, 7, 7, 9, 3600. No major delays on the traffic. 7, 7, 9, 3600. No major delays as Dan would say on the traffic. And where the hell's our food already, huh? I'm full now. Oh, you're full because you ate five bags of popcorn. Well, let's see, he doesn't care about us now. Well, it'd be nice to be just not like that huge bowl of fruits. See, that's really too much. You know, I mean, fat rich is a great guy. But those enormous bowls are fruit that he brings in here. The ones that you have to get on a high chair just to reach the top of the bowl. Too much. Too much. Putting instead, that'd be me. Putting. A big bowl of pudding. Wouldn't that be good? Boy, he is into sugar today. He's really sugar-intentioned. Sugar is shocker-intentioned. No. But like a nice ripe candle, would be so good right now, wouldn't it? Or some watermelon, watermelon? Or a pizza pizza. To put it after eight months, I'd afford a way your mind. My meatbeach, Carol City, O'Jus and Dukakis. What a name, you know? That's the only thing he's really other than the short and he's got no personality. Other than that, that name is just not going to help. See, I'm telling you, this is the big thing. The big thing with Dukakis is, is Boklava. You don't remember me. Well, I don't remember you. You give us free Boklava to everybody. Oh, she's going to have a hell of a time beating him, you know? Great cuisine is on the ballot for a healthy run. Here comes who? Rose is here. All rose and maybe Rose has got that book that we need to be reading. Okay, while we're sitting here, twiddling our thumbs. Two minutes past Davis. Ah, there it is. He's got it. Well, that's good. Good job, Rose. Just drop it off and go home. Okay, we have a call from a P-Rine next. Till-o. Hello. Yes. How are you? I'm in Wendy. Wendy, Wendy. I found a call. It was a revelation for a wholesome father. Who did you policy from around school? Everyone was at university, which was apparent on visits and we died in 2019. I... ...re alguned at the School of Student Union. Yeah. You're not just me. I see, you're a gentleman. Right. If there's one thing right there. What was that like from you? I don't fucking know. I've watched a lot of Yeah, well, a lot of people in Miami who are experts are taking a dive, but that's another story. No, no, we're not talking about that. I know, I know. Just a joke. It's just a little joke. Oh yeah. Don't get up tight. But anyway, her name's Brenda Williams, and she's favorite to make you a bit clean. And we got Edward Morris. She's also, I'm Miami. She's gonna make you a bit clean too. Rain. And that's how I'm going to be proud of it. Yeah, you got it. Yeah, well, you know, let's say something for you on the show sport. Right. And for amateur radio, we have a lot of that in this part of the show. Well, we're talking about, we're talking about what we're talking about. Right. I was wondering if my proud co-spotters would have ever seen it. Well, they deserve it. Nothing in the damn hell. Well, what is back there? They were the volleyball and Polo. Yeah, yeah. I'm just saying I'm there to the co-spotters. He means got rich and who is. There's got rich. No relation to you. Of course. Of course. Right. Okay, Wendy. Well, words well spoken and have a wonderful day. That was good. Okay, don't ever call the show. That was nice. That was nice, but she's showing for a husband or somebody. And we don't want her to do that. Okay, cut it out, Wendy. You're a great American and we love you. But cut that crap out. So where's the book? How come he's dilly dialing out there in the hallway? Thank you, water in the plant. Well, because we've only got about 26 minutes and then all these other bureaucrats will be in and I'll want their copy of the book and we won't be able to look at it. I want to see it now. Soon. I want to see those hours. Okay, we wanted to discuss it intensively on the ear. Okay, nurse ratchet. Right. I want my cigarette. My cigarette. No. I want my cigarettes. That's one of the great scenes in the history of life to be honest. I'm still trying to get that music from somebody. And I love when Jack Nicholson just smashes his hands through the glass and grabs the curtain of cigarettes. And the guy is still screaming. We're not at that point. He's beyond being pacified. He wants it now. I don't know a lot of people like that. Anyway, it's 805 and we can kind of like take a very leisurely hour. I guess he's not going to bring the book in here now. He's busy acting allu for something. I don't know what the hell he's doing. He's just acting really bizarre. Like, well, you better wait till he get off the ear before I'm going to get you see out of his mind. Like I'm going to sit around and just move in there for an hour. I want to see that 10 o'clock hour too. Although in all fairness, we didn't start that classic gold mine till June. Really? Am I right? No, I think it was in May. No, you're nuts. I can't. I'm June.

Well, why do you route eating your fourth bag of popcorn? We did mention it. We don't have the promo card in here so you might want to do this. We'll see there's been some corrections. I remember that bizarre copy that you had to read. Well, that group that is going to be performing great full dead music. What is tonight? It's four pieces jam, not four pieces of jam. As we had been second last week. Four pieces of jam. I wonder who the illiterate people are who type up those three by five cards for us? You could be any of the same people who type up some of the copy? I don't know. You think? They'll be a free rose to the first 94 women tonight. Yeah, we have, we're going to be giving Rosa away the first time. Well, I'm going to show up at my morning. He's going to be dragging a little bit. So you want to write that number just right at now and you go. Write down what number you're feeling. Oh, yeah. And then I'll tell you what mine was. And this is June we're talking about.

Yeah, that's like a monocity. It's like a tropical hut. He's got these ceiling fans being manually drawn by, but we did there is a wild fan cheese. They see in there. Yeah, a little bit. Just a little trickle somewhere in the movie. A little bit hot. That's right. So anyway, that's the way it goes. 809. See if I was making a million dollars a year, I'd still wouldn't have two nickels to rub together. So don't get too carried away. Well, you don't see that book yet, by the way. Yes, I'm anywhere near here at this morning, Hanson. What is that? You don't know how to budget. You need to put every day, put like a dollar away. It's not like my mother now. I had the end of the movie. You got to save like crazy, like mad. For what? Today's Tuesday. Yeah, I'll be there. Are you going to? Yeah. Later on, like about 435 o'clock. I'll be there.

But you can eat it over there. Yeah, she can make it over there on Tuesday. Great. And we can invite Bruce Williams. Ten minutes after right, we have a call from Cooper City, which is a real rarity on this show. Hello. Okay. Hey, turk how is it? Oh, I'm pretty good. I went over to Cooper City, Bandia today. And there's a bunch of freshmen that are coming into our school next year with a new show. You're kidding, sir. I was wondering if you can call them all douche bags. Well, I think that we don't have to just pick on a freshman. I think we can say about 95% safely of Cooper City High is douche bags, okay? Okay. Our douche bags is a case may be. Okay. At least you've saved us that 5%. Yeah. Well, it used to be about 10% but you know how things change, right? Oh, yeah. Very drastic. Those fickle kids. Okay. So choking on popcorn, huh? Yeah. Chocon on popcorn, right? Something. Okay. So what's 10 to food do you guys expecting today? Well, we're expecting anything that's edible. It doesn't choke us to that. Like a pizza would be real nice, you know? I don't expect red from the pizza hot to do that again. Like you did the other day. But if he just happened to be in a generous mood or somebody out there. Oh, boy, that would just hit the spot. So great. Oh, gosh. You know? Oh, I think my sister wants to say hi to you. Really? Oh, she's trying to make me a trick. Okay. Here she is. Okay. Wow. Hi. How you doing? Hi. When you have to. Well, we're just sitting here, uh, taking our way through life, you know? Uh, making a living without working too hard. Uh, huh. Why you up so early this morning? Why good work. Oh, do you? Yeah. I work at a big house. Are you cereal? Yeah. And what do you do there? You're like an instructor? Yeah, I'm a counselor. Fantastic. Well, you sound awfully young to be a counselor. Well, well, you're 12. And you're a counselor? Yeah. Well, that's what I like. You know, in fact, when college professors are like 10 and 11, then we know that society's been perfected, right? Okay. Well, listen, you guys have a great day. Okay, you too. And we'll talk you later. Okay. Oh, boy. 62036, 10877936, 108. We just got a call. And, uh, guys, going to send us a copy of that cook who's in this music that Montevoni, that they play when they're given the first time. I thought you said to God, he's going to send us a pizza from Johnny G. Listen, this is better. Wouldn't that be great? Johnny G's right now with the, um, dried whatever that is. Sundry. Sundry to make those pickled eggs on it. Mm. Mm. Wow, that would be so good right now. And the other one is really even better. You know what? The asparagus and the sausage, whatever it is? I don't know what's wrong with me, but I didn't come in here to eat. I don't know. Uh, we got a job to do. I came in here to eat. I don't know. I said, I don't know what's wrong with me. I just, are you out of your mind? I can't hear what I'm thinking about. We had a sheet in here yesterday with a menu for the next 25 years on this show. And you're talking, you're trying to change your images at it. Trying to protest. I just want the audience to know that in his own quiet way. When that food comes in here. There's a certain bird that will, uh, more than you can imagine, okay? Just pours it away. Love. You know, nobody said you were fat. That's not the point. There are a lot of people who are skinny. Who just pig out like it's going out of style. Now you know, I weigh once a month. I mean, I tell you that I weigh once a month. I check my weight. And we were not familiar with that. You didn't know that? You're astonishing now. And it like stays the same forever. And I hate to be the one to tell you this. You're going to get very upset. But see, the thing is though, you have to get on the scale. Oh, well, you didn't tell me that. That's why it stays the same. Oh, oh. You just don't look at it. Well, he just stands over it and looks at it. But he doesn't step on it. And he just doesn't understand it. Just always isn't the same position. I weighed the early this month, couple of weeks ago. And I lost two and a half pounds. Isn't that great? And you're right. I do wolf that food. I'm going to come to the end. Weird isn't it? Yeah, I'm not as weird. Huh? You know, like my English roommate, they measure things in stone, stone, like your seven stone. Oh, it's, uh, my Jagger's birthday today, by the way, stick to stones. We haven't. We got him. Oh, I haven't done that yet. I was going to cue this up and I'm going to tell you. Darling, while we talk to Jimmy on a mobile phone, we'll do that. Jimmy. Good morning, Neil. How are you doing? I do. We have an update on stems of potential. Well, about the reason I asked is I was flipping through the valley yesterday. Oh, I caught Mr. Ego. Yeah. And so probably the first time in history, he wasn't slicing stone into million pieces, which led me to believe where we might find them, coming on in the morning there, possibly. In the morning, in the morning before, uh, 16. Oh, midday. Good day, right. I'm out today. Uh, I wouldn't be surprised. I think a big complimentary. I wouldn't be surprised. Well, wouldn't that be something? Now, what's Mr. Ego going to say if that should happen? Yeah. We've been very contemplating. I'm going to swallow all those words. And all those illegal tapes that he played on here and behaving like a baby, you know? You were actually complimenting spirit. And I know he had a great potential. Well, I do know this. The only thing I could tell you is I don't know that Paul Lyle, even with his ego and everything, he's going to be history pretty soon over there. So somebody's going to be doing that. Oh, sounds like he was sort of heading him a little before he comes to visit. Petting him a little bit. I don't think Stan would like that. I like that. Well, what keep you posted? Well, it sounds like an interesting potential. That's a, all I can dig up. He's not listening to a word that I'm saying. It's 815 on Zeta Floor. Now that's how a lot of people from New York are. You know, they just talk and they don't listen. 620 3600 and Dave 779 3600 and Broward. So when you learn to step on people. I just found out. I've never taken a break. Stone is 14 pounds. Oh, well, let me figure that out. So you probably weigh about 10 stone. That's right. Like 146. I think Mick J. I can weighs more than that. I think just as lips alone way more than that. No, too. He's 45 today. 45. Is this his birthday today? Yes, it is. He's Jagger. Happy birthday, man. And two egg. I'm using T.A. Miami Beach. Fort Pierce, Fort Myers. Fort Drum. Fort Drum. One of my favorite. Fort Drum. Yeah. And the favorite places on the turnpoints. Yeah. I always stop at Fort Drum. I don't have to do that. What's in Fort Drum, by the way? Is anybody know? Is there anything there? No. It's like a little tiny circle off the edge of the turnpoints. Yeah. So anyway, T.A. 59. Here's the Major League snowboard for the last time this morning. The most sick and tired of him. Like that big wall was over in Tampa. Mm-hmm. And what's the thing? The mayor of sunrise. The ex mayor of the general. Oh, he's on the mellow. He's got he wanted to be as he was. He was just until the Rogers of sunrise. Okay. Well, I'll tell you if you'll pick my garbage up for me. John, no problem. I'll give you some pointers. You can use my lines. Okay, you can say do sprang. When you're in sunrise, boy, it fits in. Believe me. A lot of do spags in sunrise. That we need Oregon headline music here if you don't mind. Oh, geez. After yesterday, if you're last night, you think I'm going to fight it. That was sitting right here. Uh, never mind. I'll get it. I'll fight it. Oh, I have this. Just dolled a little bit. Oh. And the poster is falling. Well, well. I don't know. You can't do it until we find your organ music. Well, you had it. You played it. Did you look in the machines? You could see you've been playing it this morning. I have not played it this morning. Wow. Yes, the organs? I did play it today. Yeah, sure you did. I think you've been fantasizing. Well, too possible. Yesterday, I was thinking, we played a lot yesterday. We played it so much that it's like. I know I heard it this morning. You heard it this morning? I swear I heard it this morning. It's just organ music. Yeah, we didn't play it this morning. Uh, I think you did. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And then then then then then then then then then then then then. Well, I don't know. This is why you play the time tunnel. Kind of. Yeah. I don't know. The bird forever. The bird forever. That's a great idea. That was nice. You know, I remember the day when boy you could put your hand on a cart just. Well, they played a certain whole play upside down. You know, we got no place. I wasn't blaming you. I was just saying I remember those days. Somebody stole our organ card. Yeah, where's our organ? Somebody stole our organ ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, that's crazy. Guys, this is ridiculous. We don't have time to fart around with us all day. You've got all mighty. We got to find that organ before it's too late. Oh, now what is this to introduce, Captain Dave? What are we getting this organ out for food and now it's fine? Oh, okay. Are you, did you find it? Yeah. Well, it's worth it. Well, worth it. Did you find it? Well, it's worth it. Well, worth it. Jandar C. came back here and said that the boys from pizza hut were on their way. Are you serious, guys? I can't believe it. I was even embarrassed to suggest it because they were so nice to combine do that the other day. This early in the morning. That was worth an organ introduction. Okay. You're right. See, I thought it might have been an inquisitive decision. Yeah, it was. Oh. Okay. Watch out for that. I know five on Zeta 4 and we'll continue with these calls because the calls have been really staggering. They haven't. That's seriously. They've run the game. We've had everything from Ted Bundy to what? Yeah, Ted Bundy did call it. To garbage bags. To garbage bags. And I think they kind of fit together. Don't pay. Yeah, I think I got to take Ted Bundy and put his parts in garbage bags. Okay. Well, listen, if you didn't know it before, I'm sure you know by now what a real pain in the brain it is and how expensive it can be to get car insurance. Especially if you have a few tickets or drive a high performance car or drive like Ted Bundy. Unless you get your insurance from A.O.K. auto insurance with orifices all over Brown County and Alabama brand new orifice in Miami. Well, hello. Don't forget about that great plan. They've got an A.O.K. under which you may not even be charged. Additional premiums for the first five tickets on your license. But you have to call them or stop by one of their orifices to see if you qualify. So pick up that phone right now and dial 411 for Brown information and ask for the A.O.K. auto insurance office near you and for Lottonale, Pompano, Margate, Davy, Hollywood, Dearfield, BJ and the city of choice. Hallendale. Hmm. And now with their new Miami location, just call 411 for day county information for that orifice. And as we've been telling you the guys at A.O.K are going to save you a ton of money too because they can ensure you would state required PIP for a poultry puny, Pucilimonious 35 bucks.

Something to that was proud of. A.O.K. Uh, ranked hands 60% today with a high near 90 partly cloudy tonight. We'll go about 75. 76 at Zeta 4. 908. Keep going. Okay. That was good to get time. How did I do that? I don't understand how I did that. Your psychic. I see what happens is at the beginning of the day. I look ahead and I, you know, what do you call that thing? Um, piece of paper. You know, I'm not a piece of paper. The pink marker. Oh, you mark them with you. Highlight. Highlight. Highlight. Highlight. And so what I look ahead, I kind of like program it in my brain. Okay. You do. That amazing. Even it's after nine on your luck outstation. What does this a steward is doing an article for David magazine? And he wanted enough you could answer some questions. Steward. Are you good morning? And what is this about? I just thought we were all these super numbers that you're getting on the O and and they're going straight up. I got no one went and went and went and went and went. And that it's about time someone did a positive article on the O Rogers and your fantastic morning show team. Well, let me just point a few more. You know, a lawyer, a loving listener is opposed to that. Tell us the right. The end of the hall. A paranoia media. Yeah. I did. I was just going to try to tell you that the numbers I've got are the only things that are going straight up. Just a little joke there, Stewart. Very profound. Very little. I was like to do that actually. I did talk to Rose and I got about 19 out my 20 questions were I have nothing to say or no comment. Really? No. What kind of questions were these? Well, I can give you one, which you might set the tone of the interview. Neil, why are you so peeing play on it to about your life apart from the radio show? I know. He's told them that 30 are damn business. I have nothing to say. Well, let's see. What's the answer to him? He'll watch his life and that's one of the questions. Why do you do it? Why not? Why do you sort of set yourself up and request? Why not? Okay. There's a lot of glass in your mouth. He has one of these questions. He doesn't want all these people. They don't want any answers. But it's a problem. You like to have all this kind of hearing. Yeah. How about now? Is that better? That is part of it. I was going to say the closets two crowded already. Okay. There's not room for me in here anymore. That's nice. Okay. Stored. This on a scale of zero. Well, maybe we should do it off the hair. But I didn't want to give you a deal. Warsaw. You know, it would throw at you and get your instant reaction to frequently. If I chron it, they'll ask when they're in Fort Wayne, Fort London, Nelson, Central, Old Fort. F.F. F.F.

Is that a bulletin that they're little on the limpersed. It's almost people don't know what David magazine is. Correct. That's correct. Unless they hang out at the coper places like that. And by the way, it's not the coper down there on Bird Road. Every time I say the coper that poor guy down there listens. They get the stuff set and hysterical because that's, uh, as straight as an arrow. Okay. The coper on Bird Road down there by Tropical Park. And, uh, everybody in there is as straight as, um, well, not everybody's like, as Lee B. Lee. But it always has been that way. Why, hasn't it? That one. No, no, no, no. I don't think about that one. I don't know what I know about that place. And the coper up in, uh, Fort Lauderdale. Got only knows what's going on. But it is still open. It last report, I think. And, uh, all those have backstreeties closed forever. I just want to mention that. Yeah, I was on the way to musicians exchange and downtown Fort Lauderdale. And it was like Saturday night out empty empty empty. Yeah. That's part of the new, uh, death and desertion plan in Fort Lauderdale. Yeah. And it fits right in, of course, with the new project. That's going to be a geriatric nursing home in the parlor. So they call it the D&D plan and bingo parlor, probably. The death and desertion desertion desertion. This D&D. And today, of course, is dead Tuesday. So it's right there. So I'm going to clock. Walking dead. This is a special day for you.

And it says here in parentheses, that's the beer out of San Francisco. Hmm. And if you, uh, you get a, if you have a dead t-shirt on, you get a dollar admission for dollars without. So you had to put some of this stuff in the rack. Okay. I'm going to have to come in early tomorrow morning and do that. Once in a great while, I get inspired and I do that. Yeah. I'm like, this is a mess. I know this is a mess. Well, they've, they've jammed a whole bunch of extra stuff over here now. And it's just, yes, he we cleaned it up just about three weeks ago. So, mess. Oh, no. What do you say to three of us like meet it? What is tonight down a few anchors steam talk about old times? This man out of his mind. Yeah, we'll see you there, Captain. Yeah. Wait for us. Okay. Yeah, wait. We might be a little bit late, but you hang out there. Wait. No matter how long it takes. 13 past nine on Zeta 4 or 6 to 0, 368, 7, 7, 9, 3600 and Broward. And the Tom Jick has said something about an island. What do we say? Or the chosen island. And chosen island. Yeah. Yeah. People seek it out. And I guess if you look in here that would certainly be the indication. Mm-hmm. And I'd be honest with you. I'm going to lay it right out on the line like the like Stewart said, painfully honest, I don't know why there are more people listening the rest of the day. The music is pretty damn good. I mean, there's, so there are some cuts that I don't like. I don't like or you don't like, but that's subjective. I mean, you know, we don't program the station to one person, but there's a lot of great music. And especially when you compare it to the crap that's being played a most of the stations in town, I don't understand these numbers. I really don't. Um, I, I wonder if people didn't sample the station back when we first came over here. And they were playing a lot of obscure music. It's not that way anymore. You know, like, maybe I see what's an ampoule. You just listen to the music the rest of the day. Yeah, they heard it then. They heard records they didn't know. So they never came back. And I think they're trying more now to play familiar music. At least it sounds like. Mm-hmm. See what I'm saying? You should sample it again. People should try it again. I did. What do you think? Yeah. Well, they better, you know, they better do better. We're going to go find out where they live and beat them over the head with a wet noodle or something. Okay. Oh. Oh, one. There was something I wanted to say. A noodle, flat, you know, you said noodle. And that's something in his brain. Oh, good. Yeah, you know, whenever I say noodles, he's so nice. Not to have to reach way up here anymore when they redo this room again, you know? It's a good time. Noodle for the great taste. Who could this be? Neil, this is noodles. It might be that it's always a good time for the great taste. Oh, like a year ago. I was like that breathless sound. Yeah. That noodle. That kind of funny. Oh, I've got an incredible story about him, by the way. Noodles. About a TV ad that they did. Yeah, he refused. Oh, yeah. I heard that story. Can we tell that on the air? It's not even worth it. It's too long of a story. But the bottom line is he refused to do this routine with you. Because he was going to get his hair wet. That's correct. All the sharp viewers to do it. Yeah. And just got into a big snit and screaming match. And they had the general manager on a phone with it. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. Mm-hmm. That sounds to me. Oh, wow. He just, um, being the second banana and not making this much money, it would does, would kind of like, uh, turn you apoplectic, I guess. Why is that? The guy used to be, uh, what did he used to do? He used to program the cards for Ricky Tickie. Yeah, correct. I do the trick, but that's another story. No, I didn't. I'm just joking. Okay. Just a little joke. Coming to town on the 30th of this month. The on. Play the whole thing. Why not? I'm going to make it a ring. What a wreck it. What a real crime change. It could be word love. Hmm. Tell you how a sharp gunster is this morning came in. He said, where's this pizza from the radio shack? Oh, we're going to check pizza. Oh, get out of here. We should take it away from, you know, it is so the pineapple one with the hand. I'm serious. You ought to broaden your horizon. You're wasting your time over there. Well, I'm sure it's very good. What is on that one? It's not hiding. Just plain sausage. How pedestrian. I'm not. You are not. Well, I'm telling you, these are a trim. Now, do you remember the day you were doing the same thing with Johnny G's? You were sitting there and you were eating whatever it was. And then I had the other stuff over here. And when you tasted the one with the sun right in tomatoes, your eyeballs were rolling around like a pinball machine. Oh. And they haven't stopped since. Am I right? You loved it. You kind of try new things. Gee. That's what we've been telling you. Our program director. Hmm. There's bacon or something on this. Yeah. I'm telling you, listen, what doesn't stop. You must have the pineapple. I'm telling you. Okay. I'm going to do it. Not really fighting you on this. Okay. Believe me, you'll thank me. You'll write me in your will for recommending that to you. Trust me. Okay. All right. There he goes. Oh, that's the old one. Now you're still messing around with that. Oh, you can't. She needs to. All right. All right. I allowed to finish. Well, you can finish. I guess finished that and have a little a sure bit or something. And cleanse your palate. Okay. I'll probably. I'll just see that. Hmm. You've just seen the face of God. The progress of American dialogue the past 20 years is Jerry Ruben is chanting for 18 years ago about revolution and all. And in the other room, you guys are arguing about what slice of pe凈. And I think it's like a perfect fail. At least we haven't sold out like Jerry Ruben. Okay. We haven't become an establishment like he is. Oh, I know. Do you brag he is? I think that says something about something. I have been saving all morning that's going to shock you beyond your wildest dreams. It is a clipping from the star July 19, 1988. And it says, look alike. Johnny Depp and Debbie Osmond. Is it darling Debbie or Depp in drag? Wow. Now this is shocking. And the letter, this is a letter the editor it says. When I saw Johnny Depp dressed as a woman, I was shocked. He looks like Donnie Osmond's wife, Debbie. BJ involved him or rights. Okay. The editor rights back. We thought he looked like Victoria Principal. And this is Johnny Depp in drag on the left. You're going to go nuts. Wow. Wow. With a wig on. Oh my god. On the left. Yeah. Wow. So anyway, that Johnny continues to just dazzle us. You know, we got to let it the other day that he had been married for a while and nobody knew about it. And just all kinds of stuff going on. 930 on Zeta 4. Let's take a call from Fort Latterdale. Hello. How you doing? Oh, good. I wanted to ask you something about the snowboard. About the one? The snowboard. The snowboard? The snowboard? The snowboard? Oh, the snowboard? Yeah. Okay. I'm sorry. If I don't hear my favorite team scores, it's safe to have some that they did not play. I would think so. Yeah. Like, which team were we talking about? Cincinnati. Didn't play. Oh, okay. And also I wanted to do that. What about Sarah? Let me just turn it yesterday was Monday. Yes. And a lot of teams have the day off on Monday. And other comes as a great shock. But very often there's like a limited schedule on Monday. Oh, okay. I was turning my radio dial the other day. So what? Well, it's not so happened to land on the leaf fowler show. And you were talking about originality earlier. And what was he saying? Mung brain? Now he was explaining about how if you looked up a word in a dictionary. You probably had certain person's face. Oh, no. Yeah. So I thought you'd be interested in hearing that. Well, you're an official Zeta Spina. Wow. Oh, no. Oh, yes. Will be sending you your thing in the mail, okay? Okay. Okay. Have a good day. You too. I'm 30 one. You say to four. What's that? Yeah. That's what I'm saying originated. But in terms of talk show from this area, I'm the only one that says that. Okay. So don't let Lee off the hook because we've been getting sorry. I'm a course at him ripping off material for a week's now. Okay. That's true. What is that interesting? Are we totally shines us now? We don't hear from him anymore. Now that he's a big superstar in West Palm Beach. Huh? A Betty still listens. Now listen, if you think that one is good, you're enjoying the pineapple? Very good. Yes, it is. If you think that one is good, wait till your next piece. With a sun ripened tomatoes? Oh, I didn't know I had that. Oh, look forward to it. Oh. Pineapple is delicious on this. Very, very. It really is. It's not surprising. It's shocking. I don't think I've ever had it on pizza. So when I go back to Waikiki in a couple of weeks, two and a half weeks, you realize it's only two and a half weeks. Now you're going to be on vacation next week. That's correct. And where are you going? Um, a way. Yeah, I'd rather not say. Oh, that's okay. A few places. I think a few places. But you're going away. Yeah. Yes, I am. That's good because we all need a change of scenery. Yeah. Friday. You can't live in a tropical jungle forever. You have to break your way on through the. I do. You're all the heavy, um, undergrowth and underbrush. Um, underarms. I'll do that. So you're going away for, and what are we doing here? Does anybody know? I think you guys are going to be broadcasting out of the other studio. But we're going to be in there. I think so. And then the week after that, you'll be back. Mm-hmm. And then the week after that, I'll be gone. There you go. Yeah. I'll be back August 8th. I think it is. Yeah. And then the 11th is my last show in a way for another 10 days. So you'll be here just. You do have on on Calico Avenue, the main dragon, why can't you. They do have a great pizza place where they have all kinds of toppings, including the pineapple pizza. Mm-hmm. It sounds like well, and it sounded, uh, grotesque to me before, but now that I've tasted it for the first time, it is, it's tremendous. It is beyond description. And again, my thanks to Red, who's a super guy at the pizza hut over on 180, 6, 103rd wherever they are up here in Northeastern. Mm-hmm. I'll be going to do is even whisper it and they come rushing over here. They cook these special because you realize to be cooking pizzas at 830 and 9 o'clock in the morning. Obviously, they're not even thinking about being open. Yeah. I hope it will. And they do this just for us and we're very grateful and we can't say enough great things about them. Okay. In fact, some things get better than more you do them. You know what I'm saying? And I've been working at that for years, but it just doesn't work out. So why stop when you've got a great thing going. I'm talking about the phenomenal sale of Florida's leading mobile phone company, ABC, cellular. Unbelievable. It's a touchy portable phone. And you get the top of the line, any C car phone, absolutely free along with it. And the response has been so great that ABC is going to do it for you again this week. And there's more. They will give you four hours. That's right. It's total of 240 minutes of free airtime on cellular one with this deal. And when you finance with ABC's low-easy monthly payments, you don't have to pay a penny until next year. So that's got to be the best deal ever on the best pair of mobile phones anywhere. You pick up your phone and call ABC cellular right now in date call 621-6000. That's 621-6000 in Broward call 722-422. That's 722-42. And you don't need a course to teach them that. And that's really simple. That's what kids need to know. Guns are dangerous. Don't touch them. Because with a kid, you know, you start teaching them how they work in this land. All of a sudden, you get, it's, it's, it's said very well. And this article, it peaks their curiosity. It was there the ones who's business is stimulated. The more people are interested in guns. So I feel about it. How do you feel about it? Boyne Beach, you're on WIOD. Hello. Yeah, hi Steve. I just want to say that I mean, whoever thought of this law, I mean, it's absolutely horrendous. You're absolutely right. I couldn't agree with you more. Yeah, it's disgusting. But again, something not at a character with the NRA. Definitely not. You know? I mean, anybody who wants to teach, you know, 6 and 7-year-old kids, you know. I mean, I know when I was little, I just go for my friend's house as father of the deputy. And the first thing I do is just stare at that gun case, you know. And I know when I, I don't know how to gun now. And I'm 22 because I know, you know, what can happen when you have a gun? Well, the very dangerous, anybody that has kids in the house should either not have a gun in the house or have it hidden so far away that a kid could never get to it and she keep it unloaded. Kids don't need to know about guns. They really don't. All it, all it, my mind keeps shorting on and off. Is that, you don't know why? It did it twice. All right, anyway, it's probably the NRA fiddling with our lines here or something like that. But anyway, it's good to have you support. Now I'm hoping that a lot of people who are opposed to this will speak out and not permit this to become part of our school curriculum. I mean, our kids have a ton of time learning reading, writing, and arithmetic, which are the things they're there in school for. What is this man doing? You have any idea? I was born 16 things at one time. Sorry. 16 at least. Well, why don't you try just 14? Why'd you try one? I'm trying. Boy, this man is just out of his mind. I think it's that, you know what happens when you eat a lot of sugar in a very short period of time? You like those sugar shockers? You feel like you're vibrating. Exactly. It's so terrible today. It's so enormous piece of chocolate mousse cake that he ate. There was so much sugar concentrated in there that Dave, it like affected his brains. He's like a hypoglycemic, whatever. Do you feel like you're vibrating? I'm just speaking of vibrating. Here he comes ladies and gentlemen, but I'm at the Maccas. He's in suspended animation today. Rose Folder just came wheeling in very slowly. I mean, never so slow. It's watching for those dogs. Just barely moving. But anyway, he wants to fit in with the town. And I think he's finally took him a little while, but he finally figured out what it's all about. Nine minutes past nine on Zeta 4, and we have Jay America standing by line 5, Jay. Are you doing? All right. How are you doing? Great. Boyd tell you your stuff is getting so good that it's frightening. I love you. Thank you very much. Thanks for playing on that month. I mean, it's like, I don't believe you play it on this. We don't either. We don't either. Please, Kate. It's very much. We just don't, I don't know. I'm having a ball going. Great. Well, it's tremendous. I don't know why you're wasting your time with this. You guys are the dude guys. Give me a good time every morning. If I can return at least a minute of it. That's, you know. Good. Well, that's enough for us. Appreciate it. That's great. I see it. Give you a buzzer. I'm going to chance to call it as a motorbike. I know. We're very, really hear from you. But we have, we have most of the time just to order. And we do want to thank you for the bagels, too. Even the ones who give me a headache. I get them right down the road from you, too. It's a big time. I rest on the other side. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, the rest of us like them, Jay. No, I like them, too. I just did. I can't eat them, but I love them. Well, I see if I can get a, Why are you taking for me? Yeah, or some chocolate mousse cake would be good. I would be hungry. Yeah, something like that would be great. You know, not too big. Just, uh, you know, for four or five folks. Fantastic. Well, listen, thanks, Emelian Jay, and keep up the great work. Thank you, buddy. See you later. It's 10 past nine on Zeta 4. Now, see, okay, and there now, he's just, uh, wandering around like a lost child. Isn't he? I'm all thrilled because this might even require organ music. Uh, you know, maybe not. Well, I know I didn't put that away. So the number of carts is dramatically. tremendously. Yeah. Look at that. Oh, my God. What an improvement. A real story. Yeah. Well, see, it helps when you don't have 85 stacks of carts all over the place. We just reached. Take number two of all the morning show promos and Bill. What does that mean? That means we have yesterday's promos. Is that in a rack somewhere to one that we were playing yesterday, which is an old one, but was really worth playing again? Three months ago. Yeah. There he is. He didn't, he didn't worry, it's a spenders today. I thought, I must be losing my eyesight. I thought I saw he's suspended rose in the rosemobile. Have you got it? Mm-hmm. Well, he's not going to play it. He's just got it. I don't know if you're not going to kind of funnel it for a little while. I just went big boy. What's that? I wanted to tell you what happened to me over the weekend. I had a picnic. We did a call. We did a deal with all my friends. You know what happened? I'm afraid to ask. I was so quick. Mm-hmm. And my friends all looked at me and they started yelling. You're framing your framing. I said, I'm not too big, this is. I was so close. I wasn't bullied. I was like, I'm just being with you in the call. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Oh, good. Like, that's a news bulletin, right? That was good. Providence after you guys see he's like hard to predict. Some days we have to dump him and he disappears immediately. Another day he's great. He's not chronic though. He calls about once every two, three weeks. Yeah. Unlike some of those other people. Okay. Like, ducking. Okay. Let's go to Fort Lauderdale because that's always where our best calls come from. That's how. I went up, Neil. Not too much, pal. Ah, that much. Well, bunch of guys working on teach yourself and Fort Lauderdale, featuring we tried to reach you for a few more. Yeah. Yeah. Because with this theory, it's morning and you got a good show, man. Okay. Thanks a lot when you see Arnold, thank him for that 40 action. Okay. What a maniac. 913 on Zeta 4, 620, 3600 and Dade. This, you notice when he first called, he didn't have the accent. That's your main spot. In other words, he acquired it during the call. Okay. So it's a very dangerous thing that you better watch out for. This has been a group of some of the most incredible calls in the history of broadcasting. One right after another. But even the worst of these calls compared to that thing that I heard yesterday, he couldn't hear it because he was on the air here. And there's always, you're like me, you're like, oh, I mean, there is no way in your wildest nightmares that you can imagine how bad and how embarrassing that was. Oh, just giving no meaning to the word desperate. What are you guys talking about? Mr. Eko, show you today. You know, your buddy that used to work with? I love those stories. He tells, by the way, when he used to work with Mr. Eko, that's her great. I'm not really having a whole lot of stories about Steve. But they're great. See each other too much. Or weren't you lucky? He speaks very highly of you captain. Yeah, he was all right. You know, we got a long while, you know? Mm-hmm. We did. I never listened to a show because I was too busy in the other room. Yeah, like most of the audience. Kind of like this one. I didn't listen to this show because I'm too busy in this room. I'd 14 on Tata 4 and we have another mobile call in Dave County. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. You don't have a recording? Oh, no. Oh, not a yes. Here's a guy, a yenta in a car. Ha ha ha ha ha ha. I've been building this new pizza store up in the Gubernacini. Yeah, it's for last two months and I've seen his red Corvette go around 10 30 down Palm Avenue. Uh-huh. And I thought it was you. It is. It is you. And I was going to be opening this new chain about next two weeks. And I don't even know where you guys radio station. It's a thin any pizza. Well, let's go and I'll pick it up on the way home. I said no in the Dreson Center. The one? No in the Dreson Center. The Dreson Center. Yeah, it's sterling in the 170. Oh, yeah. Okay, the pizza chain in there called all star. All star pizza. Right. And I was in here. Uh-huh. We're going to chance stop buying this house. Okay. When are you going to be open soon? Now that we gave you the free plug. When are you opening? Two weeks. Two weeks. And two weeks. Okay. I'll stop by. Okay. I'll open up the truck. No problem. So you're late. That was an all about other than he was looking for a nice free back. Well, is it? That was the extent of it. Well, they're just an awful lot of people out there. You know, when do you think people would be busy? Let's do the show from the gate. And we'll just describe all the cars that we see go by. Oh, that'd be neat. When the weather gets nice. Or up on the corner, how would that be? Up on the corner. Yeah. Yeah. That would be great. Now, who'd be? I'm going to describe some of the garbage that they're throwing in the canal. Oh, yeah. Some of the fish that they're pouring out of there that look like something from the prehistoric game. You know, that road, we call it dead dog, galley. Dead man dog. Yeah. People always toss their trash there. Right. Idiot. I was on my way home. He just pulled over on the side of the road and dumped this whole thing a lumber in the middle of the road. Yeah. And split. Well, exactly. In fact, we're going to be giving the exact location that for people who were frustrated about where to dump their garbage in line with our show yesterday. So tune in the bar. Well, we'll be giving you. It's just a joke. Okay. It's just a joke. Take you serious. He was like so far out of it today. So I had too much show. Look at, yeah. Look at what he did with that plate. It looks like he looked a bit like a bit. Boy, boy, we should have had Johnny Dark here. At least he would have eaten half of it. Anyway, we would have had a probably a fist fight. But what a guy's out of the way. What a bit exciting. Well, he's bigger than he is. Especially in the public. 9.6. We have a quintessence call here. I mentioned that earlier, and somebody's going to tell us whether they're still around. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. You know, because it's weather, you know, I got cut off work work and construction. So I was heading up U of Slon and turn off. There's a quintessence right down there. Well, I'll be damned. Yeah, you'll be damned. It's been there a long time, you know. Yeah, apparently. And supposedly really good, but I've never ever eaten there, which is astonishing, but they just never got around to it. Yeah. Of course, the fact that it's cold here. You know, it's like listening on the market. I've been very tired and certain. You left my hold. Yeah, you know, well, well, I have to turn down the radio around for a start getting dizzy. You know, I got you found coming from one year and then two seconds later, coming from the other year. Yeah. Good. Now you can feel just like Captain Dave. How's that? Okay. Have a great day, sir. Okay. 917 on Zeta 4. These calls today, man. This is what life is all about. This is what life in Florida is all about. And that's why there's so many of us try to get the hell out. Does this guy bring in pizza? No. Not for us. Huge. No, it's probably for Jam Michael. Okay. One of those leather cases. No, he doesn't. Not today. No, he does not. Well, no way to second. Does he? Or you just making this up? You know, it might be a nice little snack after all. Oh, God. This man after that 42 pound pizza chocolate moves cake that he ate with that enormous. Oh, my God. That that piece of chocolate on top that round there was his biggest mouth, Rush mail. Okay. And he just inhaled it. Well, as long as you burn it off, it's okay. I hear the door opening now. Okay. Did the guy come into building? That's it. Jam life room. Oh. What a big disappointment then. He's in engineers are so sensitive, you know. No, they used to. Just because they're brain dead. Anyway, it's the 918. I never forget when he first started working here. And we had a few problems back then. Yeah. You were chewing out on the air and he was in here in his face was beat red. And he looked at me. Now, now he likes it. He's a serious. I don't worry about it. Now he's used to it. Now he understands our sense of, yeah. You're right. No, you're right. And he gives like a high sign and says your number one. Yeah. Yeah. Now he is used to it. He likes it. Anyway, it's 18 after nine. And you'll notice by the way, I just mentioned in passing what a great job. We did a clearing this thing out here. So it doesn't go through all our stuff away later. And filling up the racks. And I think we did a idea. You're yes. Yolven job. Yes. Exactly. Perfect. You think that Yolven and Yolven are like kind of related? Mm-hmm. Now you're sure that. No. Are you sure that? Not. I think I want to make good beat out of two minutes, right? Okay. That's your intro. It's 919 on Zincill. Oh, close. The closer the windows. Okay. I mean, put him in a kind of like feel like padded cell. You know, given the feeling of one before we haven't committed to it. So then you'll feel right at home. So anyway, it's 920 on Zeta 4. I want to beat. And giant tires. And Margate. Now, 24 WZT might be a bit. Anyway, tomorrow morning, Fat Rich brings in the fruit or narrowly brings in those big bulls or fruit. And I was thinking, you know, they're great. It's delicious and we're very grateful. But last night, my mother's house after listening to that excruciating, grow, test two hours. She had cantolope for dessert. Okay. And it was so good. And I was thinking maybe instead of having that bull with all that different, I don't know, I'm not really sure what some of that stuff is in there. But like can't open watermelon sounds good to me. Okay. Because watermelon has, is all water. There's virtually no calories. And if it's good water, melon is delicious, you know, sweet and juicy. And of course, they take out the pits first. I just want to be great to have seedless watermelon. I think they're, I think they're new, uh, new kind. I think there is. I'm sure they're working on it because we have seedless oranges. Yeah. Yeah. Take a saw on CNN and see what's in real managers. I eat them. You know, it's like it's good fiber. You just chew them up. I don't eat the seeds. You know, they have sunflower seeds in a bag and watermelon seeds in a bag. Why can't you just chew them up and not have to worry about it? You don't have to worry about spit. No, no, no, no. That's what I do. You know, call me crazy. Yeah. Please. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha ha. Now that watermelon flavored gum that they have, um, um, now do you eat the seeds in that? Captain Dave. I remember when, uh, you see a pregnant lady. They always used to say, what'd you do? So all of a watermelon. I can appreciate people that like to eat good things quality food for better health. But when he was mixing her gerbal juice earlier, I thought it was one of most disgusting. Sure, 26 past nine on Zeta 4. We have a long distance call from West Palm Beach, Chelo. How you doing? Okay. Listen, I just have to tell you last year. I was living in Brooklyn. Oh, my God. And I listened to 92 K Rock Howard Stern. Howard Stern. And he is the absolute biggest dish dog ever met because he's just not as funny as you. He makes nothing to it all. He's at all. All he got is about three or four words that he says every day about a hundred times. Did you know that he was in New York now last time I heard you talk about him was quite a while ago. Yeah. All right. So yes, this is long distance. And I know you hate West Palm and Jesus. No, I don't. We love Palm Beach County. We love the people. We just ate the town. You're well at up. Why, though? No, I just kept it. I was going to raise my amy. I lived on Kendall Drive till I was 18 years old. Yeah. And I moved up here on a moory lag. You know. Well, great. Yeah. But the people up there are so relaxed that most of them are like in a more choreo. Yeah. Yeah. I know what you're saying. But you know, I'm like, I don't have to drive down 95. Yeah. Oh, no. There's something to be said for living in a ghost town. I agree with you. Yeah. Well, it's not a ghost town. I mean, I work in a ghost town. I work in Jupiter. Oh, yeah. I work in the great restaurant in Jupiter. But I live in West Palm and it's pretty, you know, there's a lot of restaurants. What restaurant is it? Do you want to tell us? Charlie's crab. Charlie's crab. Yeah. Very popular. We have restaurants in Detroit. Is that like singular? Like there's just one. No, there's a lot of them. Okay. As a matter of fact, we just open a new one and fortlaw to deal right next to shooters. Wow. Wow. I'll see this. You're looking at a chance. I'm learning. I know. I know. I know. Yeah. Great restaurant. What did she say? Well, what happened? Yeah. What did she say? Well, what happened? She said stuff. That's okay. You said like that's not close. I wasn't really sure. But I think I talked to her. You did. You spoke all the way. It's your right. Okay. Listen. Have a great day. It's nice hearing for you. I want to know what happened to all your mom that used to play before. Your mom is coming up behind the news in 20 minutes. I'm sorry. It's coming up again in the next newscast. I and Glenn, you have a great laugh. I just have to tell you that. Thanks a lot. And how come you don't move down to Fort Lauderdale and work at the new restaurant? Well, because I'm working in Jupiter. And I don't know. Because there's no room for transfer now. Managing this new place. We actually just opened four months ago. Okay. I will transfer down. Think about it. Well, tell you that. I think about it. You guys are great. Okay. She's been listening to Howard too long. Oh, this is a monocard. Here we go. Now if you listen to this guy's voice and you listen to that tape of when he is exactly the same. Are these jingles mono by the way? Who's got it? No. We got it. Who's got the spirit? We got the spirit. W-A-B-T-E-A. Even though it was an AM station, that rakesklar boy. The jingles aren't stereo. Tell me the tickets are down in Florida. Yeah. I've got some months to go. And they have this guy Neil Rogers on the radio. Yeah. Really bad. Nothing. It's fine. But bike, twisted and all that. Well, they're not that good. And all that. This is kind of Florida. Who's just like, is it entirely ripped off my whole show? Yeah. And has gone on a year. Any place tapes of the show and talks about it? Yeah. My cousin tells me about it. This is Florida. Where is Florida? He just, at least he blatantly does a rip me off. He at least goes on the air and says, I'm ripping the guy off. And in Miami. And we're all in here. He just stands up. I want you to talk about my hair. And it's like, how do people in Miami know about me? Well, they do need me. What's the guy's name? Are you Rogers, right? Yeah. And you call him to be in the Howard? I said, let's not say that. Yeah. He used to be a pretty interesting looking guy. But now he's like, kind of a shadow of his, and he always kind of looks to one side. Uh-huh. No, seriously. He always goes, let's see. The right side of his face is not, is okay. Well, when they catch him from the other side boy, it's like, David Johnson and drag. I'm glad to hear you. And he's really, really, another gig. What is all of that? Okay. He is just full of it today, isn't he? And he called me yesterday, and let me know that I left my chicken soup in his office. And that was very nice of him. Is it still there? Oh, no. What was the reason that he called? What? Oh, yeah. It's a shame that I'm not going to have time to hang around and talk to him today. But, um, what? Oh, tomorrow. Yeah. Let's see tomorrow's what Thursday? Uh-huh. Oh, yeah. We get all that food up there today. It'll probably be taking out cussells around for the show. Now, we'll get to him. That's all right. He's just a little over-enthusiastic and emotional, you know? So anyway, it's 936. What? That's a guy called yesterday from David Magazine and wants to do this. Oh, which is fine. And although David just did a thing a couple of months ago, but that's all right, cus. Since they, what? Yeah, but not the right ones. Anyway, if you don't know it by now, I'm sure that, uh, why do y'all know? I don't have to tell you unless you're an absolute douchebag. What a pain it is and how expensive it can be to get car insurance. We're going to be alone. Yeah. No, it is. Some of those soup from that favorite place or his and he puts him in there and it was great. How did you know? Yeah. It is pretty tasty. Now that you mentioned it, I had some last Monday. Anyway, uh, we want to thank Michael very much and he came by and he measured the dogs for collars and Jay Michaels vet is going to come by and give him all the shots. Oh, I thought you were going to say Michael's a shot. I thought you were going to say, measure Jay Michaels for collars. I thought you were going to say, measure Jay Michaels for collars. Now he's a little late for that, but. Now we're going to be nice, right? Cause we all love each other here and this is one big happy family. And we all embrace and do a little horror in the parking lot before the day begins each morning and that's the way to ought to be, right? You'll see the dogs. I was thinking this when I left here yesterday. The dogs are exactly what this place needs. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, they had a little morale and happiness as opposed to the usual desperation and the depression and more bidity that goes on in the hallway and everybody, oh, what do I meant by that? You know, that kind of stuff. The dogs, you know, had a little revolving under the kind of feeling, you know, that we need around this place. They're perfect. But you mean to balance out the more bidity? Exactly. I was that that just came out. Is that the declamal beehlers that doesn't look like it? That's another one. The point, point man. Point man, Junior. We wanted to mention that there may be a second. There may be a second Elton John Show added. Oh, really? So detail. We're getting all these wild stories. They yesterday, the guy called and said they only have to take its resoul. And then later on, I heard that that was a lot of baloney and they well, been sold out within like 14 seconds. Yeah. And it's pretty hard to believe that they weren't also real, real fast. You know, at any price. I know. Because I pay thousands, you know, and hopefully we'll have some freebies. It's 18, they'll 10, 9, 42. We will have some, won't we? He hopes so. We got a Mr. and Thusi is more or more. I hope so. We got a call from Luxembourg here on the, No, no, we don't. Are you cereal? You still look at this? Yeah, genius. Feeding the pooches out there now. Ladies and gentlemen, this could be one of the regular features on the show. Feeding time. I don't mean for the dogs. I mean, kind of like for the audience. And for us, well, that's already become a part of the show. Where are those sweets, by the way, Rose? Don't hold them back. Now, it's almost the end of the show. We think that you ought to bring them in here and let us at least. They were brought for us. Let's at least take a little peek, okay? We can control ourselves. Now, I sent him a tape a couple of weeks ago. So I guess he got it. Maybe that's what he's calling about. Oh, when you take care of that, I have some very important calls here. Like, do you want to talk to him? Well, he wants to talk to me. Yeah. Oh, and he said, I guess he just want to say hi. Oh, that's great. Hello. Hello. Hello. Neil. Always the second time as a chairman of this land. How you doing? We're doing great, sir. I don't want to be one of the tainted eggs that you're the pool. By the way, Gary Lawrence, 1943 this morning, boy, pretty late. Yes, sir. Go ahead, I'm sorry. I just had a comment for once of this. I kind of felt that was. Either that or I thought you were calling from one of those distant planets. You know, like Uranus? You're an obstacle to that over here. Yeah. Why do you people are also refined, you know? So damn bloody refined. Well, you can say that. Yeah. Easy for us to say that. Easy for us to say that. What are you saying? You're like, stop, ready to tap on. Oh, yeah, they're great. We're going to couple of the headlines. Want to hear them? Sure. Yeah, they're just full of stars like you. You know, the queen mother gets up and takes the walk from color pictures. But inside you. Well, in his big news, when the queen mother gets up. Yeah. Well, here, a couple of headlines. I love it. It's a 3000 year old fellow. Oh, God, I like that one. It's a bit of an improvement. Fact. Don't take that box out of here. Wait a minute. We're having a little fist fight with our program director here. He was taking our dessert away. What a lunatic. He can't pick and choose what I'm going to eat. Bring it back in here. Okay. There's something that looked great. Okay. Excuse me for interrupting Nick. But I'm famous for that. Yeah. I got a function. I want to get it together with a bit of a god. You've got a mental picture of that. Yeah, sure do. Yeah. It's kind of like the hunchback of Notre Dame. Yeah. You still want that sweet. You just want hungry off the road. Oh, yeah. Well, listen. We've just had stories about dog food with eyeballs and some very appetizing stuff. So at this point, there's not much you can do to us now, Nick. Yes. Well, this is three of those things. That's my college. There's been working with a dog dog with a paper said is suffering from work related stress. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I can relate to that. Madam two swords, you know, Madam two swords. Yes, I do the wax museum. Yeah. They, um, they're just putting a model of Michael Jackson. I've been made a mistake because it's thanks to the long-term equity model. The, if it's dated two years out of five, it's been, it's been, it's 86. It's just a very, like, it does. Well, that's all right. They can like take the pieces off and paste it back together. And that's what he does with his. Yeah. Squeeze the nose of the bed. Yeah. That's it. It's just like, I was, they think, they bring things from the first time. And you know, it's just my endless end of my life. We love that stuff. And see, that's what we're always following you folks. And that's what America has become now. Like that's what all the newscaster about is a green monsters and slaves and wild queens and stuff like that. That's what it's in one. Yeah. You ought to say this. I think that they're just saying, you know, if we just put your story stories and then nobody will really worry about the world of Middle East and everything. Okay. That's correct. And nobody cares about those serious things anyway. So that's why there's so lot of papers. Maybe you could send us one of those. We would love to have it. We like those. I'll send you the words to the punch. Yeah. That would be great. I see those sometimes, you know, I'm the guy who does the dyslexic news here on the show. Remember that you're never going to forgive me for that, right? It's not forgive. It's just, I'm never going to forgive. Well, he was just shocked in your perspicastic. Exactly. Yeah. No, he don't have to be sorry. You were right on the show. Well, we liked it. If you roll another truth, we thought it was a funny line. Okay. Well, listen, Nick, it's great hearing from you. We don't want you to rob some gigantic bill over there because you're probably going on somebody else's. Oh, great. Okay. Well, listen, say hi to the Queen for us. I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I said, I have a draft back. Okay. Teller, when I'm finished. Okay. See you later. He's an honest person.

What's somebody brings to you? He's like directing our lives. Okay. He's so intensive. He's running around like protecting me. It's okay when the sponsors come in here and fill my gut with 50 pounds of food. But, you know, somebody else from outside brings stuff in a right away. He's like protecting. Get the food back in here, Bulger. Now you know, tomorrow we're signing off at 940. Okay? No, if you eat any of that, you're going to be vibrating. You're nuts, you're nuts about time.

Yeah, I know from a horrible ban show. Well, it certainly was wonderful seeing Stuart in here and don't ever come back in the station again. Anyway, a 620, 3600 and 8779, 3600 in Broward. And you notice what good timing that was man. I clicked him like, um, yeah, he worked really good. So anyway, enclosing the show out today. If there's no reporters around you, I'm going to tell us your name is, right? That's where it is. It's kind of funny, isn't it? Maybe that's the way it looks to you. What do you live? Can't tell you right here. You get things all wrong, son. It is what you want to tell us. That's got nothing to do with this. You're going to tell us what we want to know sooner later. Where we going? George Street. That's where the jail is. Why do you ask that? Because I want to know. Yeah, there's a jail there. Are reporters? What? They're going to be reporters. What is this thing with reporters? And what's just all about? Your reporters put your name in it. Don't say. Well, you did the reporters all lined up. You get them from all the papers. We haven't been there and I'll tell you all about it. Okay, that was about last under Junior there, which I can't believe it. Anyway, it's 935 on Zeta 4 and this last hour certainly has really shocked people from coast to coast in this industry. Hasn't it now when he gave the punch line of that just did you cut his mic off? Right at the last word. Yes. The timing was just phenomenal. Okay. We have a talking meal. We have a great sponsor too. I did not tell you we were going to do this on the phone story. Did I say that on the air? I said, well, do it on the phone. And I would have been so much less painful. And so much less embarrassing and degrading and humiliating. And right away, this maven, see, this douchebag behind me with the suspenders. Or wherever he just disappeared, he's still back there. I can see him with my peripheral vision from all that. No, I, I, what I did was I bought a can of Alpo and I have an extra eye in my back now just to watch out behind me at all times. And, you know, he keeps arranging my life. He keeps setting up all these little cute things and things that I have no idea what they was going on. That's going to stop real soon. When I start calling in sick four days out of every five, and the one's like the Johnny Carson show and he shows up one day a week then he might get the clue. 936 on Zeta 4, it will come right back. And we all go home. Exactly. We go home, I take a nap and wait for the phone to ring and wake me up and stuff like that. Exactly. We go home. If that douchebag calls me again today before 1 o'clock, he's going to live to regret it. I think the three of us have gone out to lunch one time and nine and a half months. Yeah, I was the sponsor. Couple of ways to go. Yeah, that's the only time we've all gone to lunch. Correct. No, you're forgetting that breakfast. Oh, yeah. That was that that's different. That was a memorable occasion. Wasn't it? Watching the watching all the horses at Carter's rainfall on the track. That was till you're right. But it was different. Yeah, horses and it was a horses-assin, all the net. 21 till 10 on Zeta 4 and our next call is from unincorporated date county. Hello. You just great sir. Hey, you got ready to your bug yet? The California. When you're out in California. Oh, yeah. The bug is gone, sir. I think I got it. Do you really? I've been trying to pass it around. I'm glad you caught it. I don't want to lie that you caught it. Somebody's got a grab it. Oh, I heard you're talking about Johnny Depth and him cross-thrussing or something. Why? We have a picture. I don't know. Something's fruity in the mouth. He's in Steven Tyler. Dude, like, looks like a lady. Yeah. In fact, I've never seen the two of them together. Yeah, there's something weird about that. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, we'll think about it. While we come up with the answer, we'll let you know. But I'm not tempting fate anymore today. Trust me. We only got 20 minutes to go. And after that last exciting episode in Escapade, I'm just not pushing my luck. Okay. I'll stew. Make copies of that cassette and be able to sell him. I made a tape for it. Yeah, I really like those piercing questions. You know? That was funny. And they should've been, um, Phil Ross and the cutesy journalism he got into there for a minute. What the, how was he talking about? Hey, and that one is starting with that crap about T-dances, then I knew. That one's by favorite part. Then I knew it was all over. No, I like that part better than any of the others. I mean, when you come right down to it, what the hell is a T-dance? Okay. Do we really want to talk about that? Oh, seriously. What does that mean? Well, I know, and you know, but, uh, I don't, don't we? 20 minutes before 10. We don't want to talk about that. And, uh, see, that all depends on the names on there. People that haven't been born yet. And I know who the hell they are. Plantation.
