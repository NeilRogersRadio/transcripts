And we already did the thing for Ganges Grill when you were paying any attention. So we're all cut off. Is that great? Moveless. That's it. I'm just delighted that you did that man because that's what we needed to wake this audience up. A good cranch. The message says, you may want to read that for you. Read it out loud. And who it's from? Who is that? You can't guess. It's just Aussie. I don't understand. Phone number looks very familiar. How about that? Does it look like a maybe South Miami number? Friends. Friends coming out? Friends. Yeah. What does that mean? Five to nine. Five point nine. Who's Aussie? Oh, I know who that is. That's fruit cake. Aussie. Why thought it was the sixth one. Now it's a five nine. Oh, we've got that. That'll help me get it out pretty quickly. I don't know one. It's like when your horse is too light. So front you say, okay, and the race now. What in God's name is that? Oh, my God. Are you out of your mind? Hmm. Thank you, Rebela. And crazy cookies and Huckle dare. Hmm. You believe this? Thank you. This is incredible. This is so good. And the cheese bread. Unbelievable. Indescribable. Great. Thank you. Our friends at postabilities, man. They out did themselves today. This is just. What can I say? How could he possibly have the number when it's not even in a computer yet? Oh, they gave us some Huckle bears. Oh, cute. Okay, dump the bleeps, the beeps. I don't think it's necessary. Now see if you get off the phone there, Mr. Yette, we could call you. Now maybe you took the phone off the hook, huh? Thanks, Ron. He must have call waiting. Oh, he has at least two lines. He probably ten lines. Oh, yeah. He's got more lines than we do. Yes, he does. Doesn't matter if I. How are we going to eat this? I can't eat this. We have to take that home. Yeah. I, uh, later. Oh, they're in. Look at that. He is shining. Great. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. Does he look like he's shining? Uh-huh. Or flaming something like that. Yeah. Okay, it's a 10 o'clock concert of four. I need a. Yeah. I hope you beat me in the ring. You're better than I am. Even the competition agrees. The Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is the best morning show in South Florida. I think I could get the ninth year on an AM station as a year old in my book. You're like, stay calm as the quiet. You've got no problem with me. I'm not even the other morning shows. Listen to the Neil Rogers show on Saita Fort. How'd you beat me in the ring? You're better than I am. Okay. I think we have to take care of this little problem here before we go on. Oh, good. This is the one that was busy before. Right? Mm-hmm. Well, it's ringing now. They follow show. Yeah. Is this Aussie? Yeah. All right. Come on, hold on. It's a radio show. We can't hold on for you, Aussie. What's he going to do? Go get here right now? Aussie. Hello. Yes, Aussie. How can I help you? Now, what is this in sippin message that we have here? They haven't even put their numbers into the computers in Bugsville yet. Well, they've... Now, Mark Hune came over to my house yesterday. Yeah, Benny did. And we discussed this in length. Mm-hmm. And the six point one is Peter Boulders, I cue. It's not the other. I think you got that backwards. I think it's Mark Hune's IQ. And I think you got the number backwards too, by the way. Peter Boulder, well, could be, I don't know. Yeah, I think a one-six. Did you have it? That's what I got. You had a psychic, was this a psychic reading on you? It's called the monitor reading. Monitor reading. Like when you're looking the screen, wait to stand, he says. There are no numbers in there yet, baby. Well, go to your computer and somebody give me some instruction. They're not in there till tomorrow. See, he makes talking about you. You don't think they haven't done yet? No, they don't do them until the night before. Right. That's better than that. No, I don't know better than that. That's the way they feed them in there. They do them in there the evening before, late afternoon. Really? Yeah. Why wouldn't they be ahead of that one step ahead? They're not. Why do you think they would hold them back? You think they're holding them back for, for, who's being naughty and nice? Well, yeah, they hold it back for like a third day. Hmm. Make it all look synchronized, you know, for today. Yeah, here's synchronicity and great cut by the police. Well, do you have any problem with that number? With what? No, that would be nice. It's not going to happen, but that would be real nice. Oh, really? Not possible. Why is that not possible? Because we'd have to do like a nine share in January. Are you out of your mind? Well, okay. Well, you don't have faith in yourself. How could anybody else have faith? Exactly. Okay. I think you'll do a 15. Okay. Great. I see. Is that a place all over the U of M campus? Do you really? Yeah. We're big on campus. If they took the survey at Cooper City High in U of M. We'd have a 28 share. I think so. They have data things all over there. And I put our left notes on everybody's uh, when she'll think you listen to Neil. I've been on a spray painting on there. You know, I like that. And that makes us a lot of friends when you do that.
