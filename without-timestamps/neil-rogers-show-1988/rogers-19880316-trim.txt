94.9 Z4, South Florida's classic rock. The Neo Roger show is next 60-03600 in date 7-7-93600 in Broward. The king of talk radio is here ladies and gentlemen. It's time for the Neo Roger show. Good morning. What a gruesome sounding he told that was, wasn't it? It's like he's got a cold. That was gruesome. I'm the one that's got the cold. By the way, I'm just sitting here to run the board today, OK? It's all I'm going to do. Something I did the same thing. I didn't do that. I just discovered I didn't do it this machine is screwed up. Oh no. Because I pressed the play button. I know that. I'm not that stupid. Not that much under the weather. Did the same thing two days in a row. You mean equipment that we're using? Yeah, it's good. You know our friend Mal function. Yeah, good old male. I saw Mal function at the junction the other day. That was incredible. It's 552 on Z4. And now from beautiful downtown, Carroll City, the home of the Centauriess sidewalk cafe and the Zeta for Commissary, it's the Neil Rogers show. Neil's guest today are Glenn, the bird hill, Captain Dave Caprita, the mighty Rogers archflares, Dennis Rose Folger, and you, the South Florida telephone audience. Today's special guests will be Stan Major. And Joey, I'm too old for this Reynolds. Today's show is brought to you by the National Bag Boy Foundation where keeping your supermarkets beautiful is our number one concern. And by the Chub Group, a serious molestance. So pick up your phones and hold on to your bagels. As you don't want to miss this one. Hey, Neil. I understand the Chub Group are going to be on Oprah today, by the way. So, you know what I'm going to be talking about. If I'm going to tell you, if she doesn't look like Elsey the Borden cow, then nobody does. OK, I mean, seriously, she has gotten so gruesome. If they would put a ring around her nose, I'm telling you, they would put her in the circus or something. She is incredible. She made $27 million last year. I think what does that tell you about this country? Do you think it's enough? Probably not. Why doesn't she just get to hell off with her already? It is yesterday she had street people and hustlers and teenage prostitutes. And every day, she's got another one of these wacko, these perverse, bizarre, depressing, morbid. And the country just loves it, man. And what does that tell you about America's housewives? Because they're the ones that basically watch it. Eat it up. They love it. Now, ordinarily, I don't watch, but I was trying to listen to a show on AM. And I got news for you. I just, I had a shut it off. I couldn't, I couldn't handle the pain. Because I really felt sorry for my good friend. I love those people of Callstand and say, well, you know, Neil likes you too, Stan, who got no concept of the fact that were best of friends. I was the best man and made of honor both at his secret wedding. When they eloped the last Thursday night. And they're just some of these. They're, you know, there's a real interesting psychological thing into some of those guys. It's like jury witchner's gun. Stan represents the same things to some of those guys that the gun represents to witchner in his crowd. There he does. It's a macho thing, man. Oh, Stan Lee, Stan Lee. I like to. And now, of course, that he's gotten married. That's kind of like sealed the whole thing for them. Yeah. Because now they know that he's doing it. I mean, he was doing it before, but that's beside the point. But now they know. And that just relieves the hell out of the way. Now, they're, all those people are listening to this show, but a lot of them would never admit it. They couldn't handle that because it would be a blow if you'd point that expression to their thing. It's a 55 on Zeta 4 on a Wednesday morning. And now yesterday, I really am beginning to have doubts. Up until yesterday, I thought we were really not going to have done everything was great. But yesterday, in the first hour and a half of the show, it was almost like on his show. I noticed he came back yesterday from four days away. And really was not even up to believe that the phones are going to be just solid. And people are going to be just falling all over each other. But if Colin said, welcome back and congratulations at Hope Yada Wonderful Time. He still doesn't understand where he is. It's not the nature of this town. This is just basically your unfriendly town. Cold, like this morning. And the car, the thermostat for outside, said 41 degrees. Really? A thermometer, whatever the hell it is. I don't know. I'll get those things confused. The monitor. And where they go. 41 degrees. And you're outside your room. And I'm, you know, I guess I did wear a jacket, mommy. OK, I wore a jacket this morning. So I don't panic. OK, I do have this cold, but I don't feel that bad. And I didn't think I was going to be able to talk, but it doesn't sound that bad to me. Yeah, I said all stuff up. But I feel you got it, too. No, I feel great. I think the one that's been spreading it around is the one who isn't in the room at the moment. You know, he? Who would that be? I don't know. The one that's kind of floating around a building somewhere. Anyway, it's 5.56 on Zeta 4. When I started to say, is the first hour and a half, I really wonder, maybe we should come in about 7.30 and go to 11. That was great. Because I'm not so sure that in the early hours, man, there's anybody out there. Another book shows, yeah, like there's 22,000 or something people listening in this hour. average quarter hour. I don't believe it. I just don't believe it. I don't think, and all this balloon, it went around in the car and they're all getting ready to do this. You know, that's the lame excuse. I don't believe it. I don't know where those people came from. No, first hour and a half. I've never heard from such a show. Because remember the day we were given away something good? What did I give away a CD? Yeah. It was a good one too. LeBamba? You think no, no. No, it was another. It was a real good one before. Oh, is this springsteen, wasn't it? Yeah, was the new springsteen album that I got by mistake from IC Columbia CD Club. Yeah. And we gave it away. And we had difficulty filling the lines to give that away. It's six o'clock in the morning. So I have a feeling that this first hour and a half man's like, it's like, dress rehearsal. Yeah, remember when you used to give things away or they show you used to always do it early? Yeah, get it over with that. Get it over with that. That'll get him to the phone sometime. That cover of that TV guy. Yeah, we're going to talk about that. That's a save it for when people are listening. But I have a TV guy and a show that's going off the air and Oless makes the front cover. God. And these guys looked like they just crawled out from a sewer somewhere. Maybe they should have been, they should have been in the Lame Misarab. They crawled out from the sewers of Paris or something like that. Certainly not from beautiful Miami under a palm tree. And here's these a grotesque, especially Philip Michael Thomas and done what's his name with that scruffy. You know, that leads me to ask a question that nobody will respond to, okay? But you see guys walking around. Since Miami Vice was popular, which it hasn't been in a long time. But when it was, once a young guy's walk around with that Richard Nixon growth on their face, you know? I'll all odd Don Johnson thinking that it's cool to look like a slab. Like they haven't like Rob Lo is doing in that new movie of his. Oh yeah. Now for him to be doing that is sinful, okay? That's criminal. Oh, yes. I can understand if you look like Caldebegin with, you know, cover it all up, okay? Grow just like a hair ball all over your head. Guess what? I'm sorry when you said Rob Lo it just flashed in my mind. Who are you? Rob Lo flashed? I had dinner last night. I'll pay to watch them. At Joe Stonecraft. Did you really? I was out on the beach. Oh, yeah. But I bet it was lively, huh? It looks, well, in this, you know, around Joe's, it is lively. And it does look better down there on South Beach. They fixed it up a little bit. This isn't a change to lots since we worked on it. Yes, it has, I saw. I'll tell you one thing. It's changed a lot since I worked on there, which was in 76 and 7 at the cat. And it's changed for the worst. I ran into someone that worked with you at the camera. I realized that the famous was still open then. And he kneels on Altman Road, which is a good place. And it was fun. There were things happening. Well, they painted it and fixed it up. Oh, yeah. And it's so trash on the shoulder. Illegal aliens looked much better with that painted background. And now you can identify them a lot easier. Oh, cap-deve. You know, the, remember the police? The seating already felt that is mouth is full. The police department, the police department, is now an empty parking lot. And I've been done with several times. And they got a handle at Mark Kuhn become, no, seriously. The mayor of Miami Beach. She could turn into a gigantic parking lot. And it worked too much. Anyway, Matt Dylan was there. Big deal. I know what that reminds me of. It reminds me of that picture. I got it on a mail. The guy called yesterday. By the way, at six o'clock, the UZTA, Miami Beach, Fort Lodderdale, and the Palm Beach is. And here's this, what is this? No, seriously, what is it that our listeners are thinking about? OK, since the picture of Jim Palmer's Jockey that was a nice one. And in some magazine, OK, first of all, Jim Palmer's about as exciting as a frog's, yeah, I was always saying, yeah, frogs' puppet, thank you so much. I almost said something else to begin with an F. I'm in an team. But I guess we shouldn't say that. But I think that's something you find in a magazine all the time. And they're billboards of this and a guy is ugly. And he's a pain in the ass. And I'm saying most people in America are tired. I'll sing Jim Palmer, Prancer out in his jockey shorts. He's not in the least bit interested. I don't think women are interested. I don't think, go ahead. What, what did he write? Hey, Neil, simply smooth. And it's got an arrow torn just by his parts. He talked about desperate. It's like the guys out there are obsessed with River Phoenix. Some kids are saying, bang. And if you're going to fantasize about something, and you're going to get a vicarious thrill from the way somebody else looks at least, big somebody good. Why would anybody pull that add out of a magazine and send me Jim Palmer and his underwear? Man, I, in fact, the more close he puts on a happier it makes me. OK, let's give those numbers out, because we do have a couple of Broward lines. Let's date County, of course, is a sluff in this morning. And that's the way General Lee goes. And if there's anybody out there wants to explain to me, why it is that young guys have done the Don Johnson thing on their face. I'd love to hear that, because this, in fact, if there are people out there who are sick and tired of Miami fights who have just handed up to their ears, a realized that it has virtually no relationship to what's going on here other than the drugs, of course. But other than that, the show has got no relationship. So what's going on here? So I am told, I have never watched it. Would dry no shock to somebody. I have. But I have no desire to watch it. I've tried a couple of times. And after like five minutes, I just clicked the channel. I can't get into it. You don't like that oblique type of story line. No. You have trouble with it. No, I don't. I just can't handle it. Really? Well, just doesn't go any more. Captain Dave. I'd like it to go somewhere. Has been on the show. Well, that's very good. And that expression is to express anistic type of scenery. Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm. You know, everything's all like all. Tom Springs, California. Yeah. Kind of like a central. He played a terrorist on the show. Good. You're a serious part to me. OK, let's give the numbers out. And we'll give about two minutes to get the lines all that up. And then we'll go music intensive. Because like I said, I'm beginning to have my doubts about what's going on in this town. OK? Well, could be that our kind of talk is pass A already. Because these people all share. It's very possible. Well, very possible. I'm serious. I'm not joking. I don't really. All those young pinheads have kind of disappeared. You know, it's getting too many women calling. Too many. No, seriously. I'm glad they have the ladies call and spite of what that one woman said last week. But too many. Is that possible? Huh? They have too many. Exactly. Too many. I also too many old people, like, you know, 31, 32, too many. Six, so. Six, so, three on Zeta for here, the numbers. And this is your chance to speak now for ever hold your own in Dave County 620 3600. That 620 3600 and a Broward 779 3600. And you better get with it this morning. Or this show is going to be history. Call now or else. We don't want to threaten the audience doing. Call now. Let's see. Look at this. Three lines. There to go. Four, five. Look at this. That's so bad. That's probably nobody on it. Rose went out of his way to help us out this morning, says if Neil is sick, and he gave us the list of songs we could play with. What a guy. On other words, if I wasn't here, he's picking the music. Well, it doesn't say if you weren't here, just as if Neil is sick. Oh, I see. Well, I'm sick. Look at that. We can't even get the third day line lit. How do you like that? Well, why should today? Oh, there it goes. Oh, okay. Well, there are little slow this morning. I'm telling you, this is your only hour in the morning. There's nobody awake at this hour. Just a punishment for us at a song. It's not. The only show in America that ends at 10 after 10 in the morning, all right? That's that I'm bitter or anything. If you believe that, you'll believe anything. So that's why I showed up here this morning. I would not allow them the management type people to say, oh, Jay, that Roger's is out sick again, man. He's been out so much. I just won't do that. I'm going to be here if they have to bring me in on my deathbed. If they have to wheel me in on a rollaway. I heard coming in, listening to Arlene said that. What's she? She said, what's the name? Is going to be in town to bar? Who's going to be in town to bar? Portland, Maine. Oh, is he really? Gilbert's. Who cares about that? Is he audience? And the audience cares about that? What kind of a show are they running over there? One at stake. What is he going to be here for the funeral of the AM? We're in a black arm band for wins. OK, it's 605. Do a quick weather. We've got a very busy day today. Trust me. We do. Merit trust me. Sunny and cool with highs around 66 this afternoon and low tonight. 49. Jay and I didn't even see this in the first break. I'm just losing. Oh, God. Well, currently, officially, it's 44 degrees. All right. Now, what did you break yesterday? My bones, coffee cup. And what do you think I got to talk about now? That's very depressing. There's that was one of our favorite things. Although I will say that the food at bones is a little bit better than the coffee cups. Coffee cups are great because they have that combed spun molasses kind of look. Don't they? Yeah. The dark brown molasses kind of cornpone, whatever the hell it is. When the folks at bones, family restaurant showed up here at 9 o'clock in the morning, you should have seen the vultures at Zeta attack. Delicious barbecue ribs beef and pork beans and coleslaw. It says here at Zeta, but of course there were a lot of wins, vultures who were also over there. Anyway, bones can really cook the meanest barbecue in town. They've been doing it for over 58 years with the same family recipes and care going at every dish. And although barbecue is the bones trademark, they also have delicious seafood sandwiches, chicken, cutrediners, and all the fixings too. And be sure to save room for dessert. They make all their desserts, buns, cornfritors, and creamy coleslaw right there on the premises. So you check out bones real soon. It is absolutely out of this world stop by for lunch or dinner at 3,500 north federal highway in Boca that's a mile and a half north of Glades Road. And tonight and every Wednesday night is fish fry night. All white fish fillets better dip and served with French fries, coleslaw and homemade tartar sauce. All you can eat fish just 6.95 tonight and every Wednesday night at bones in Boca. The new Roger show on Zeta 4. It's so late. On a Wednesday morning and another we hear that voice. We've got good news for you. And that is lead Gillette. It's been away for a while. Lee will be back on Monday Monday afternoon on Zeta and we're very excited about that because he's a super guy in a great talent. And we need him here desperately. Trust me. So we're very pleased with that. Everybody who's a lead Gillette fan, I'll be looking for a Monday. Okay. Okay. We're going to go to the phones now. Are to excited? Look at those lines. Very sizzling. Hollywood. Hello. Yeah. How are you doing? Well, I don't even know. I don't even know. To be cropped at a moment for you. Yeah, sure you have. Okay. Tell the audience another fib sir. That is not a fib. Yeah. I know. And we'll lose a broad on that night. That's what Richard Nixon said too. I'm not a cropped. No. I'm 23 years old. That's what Jimmy Carter said. I'm not a moron. That's what Ronald Reagan said. I'm not a scene I'll old fart. You know sir. They don't like to be called broad. Yeah. That's a heard. You mean. Wait a minute sir sir. Let me say this to you. Kimba is not a broad okay. True. She's a very nice, very nice. He's got a nice bit like you know, holding for three hours. And kind of this. Well I guess that depends on what was what was what was being held. I guess is what counts with that. What is sir? Yeah. I brought this new toy yesterday. Did you really? What'd you do by one of those adult stores? No. Where I go. I go there too. I bet. I could tell. I could show you. So recording running right some of the tapes. Yeah. Okay. I'm something that I want to put off for you. Do we have that thing? Is that thing running captain day? Sure is. Well we got our take up real today. That's good. We got our fight up. I'll put this on you. All right. Now this isn't something dirty. It's okay. Well you never know with you guys. Oh, me young guy that that enjoy your show. Uh-huh. And I feel that you might write this. Okay. Go ahead sir. It's only a four-hour show now. Here with my name. Here with me. Here with me. My name. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. What do you think, you know? That's great. I like that. I can do it once more with it too. Okay. Why don't you? I don't know. Oh, there's another one. Here is number one. It's good. I like the level on these two don't you? Yeah. Yeah. That was great. That's fantastic. I don't know what to say. Anything that moves you. You know, just put it all together. I'm really moving right now. I'm really moving right now. I believe it. Yeah. Okay. Hold on a second. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on for what? Because I can put it in something else. No, no, why don't you put it all together. Are you putting this on a cassette? No, it's it's sampling keyboard. Oh, it's not a keyboard. Oh, I see. I see. Okay. This is the last one. Oh, come on. It's gotta be. These other people are waiting. You're going to have. How do you know that for sure? You know that. I'm going to. I don't want to hear about your organs, sir. I thought it was a keyboard. I don't want to hear about your organs, sir. I thought it was a keyboard. I don't know. I don't know. I mean, it's two more things. I don't want you to. Oh, these guys. Two. Two more. Real quick. Now come on. Move it. Okay. Two more. Six, twelve. Well. Well, we're going. That was good. That was a dynamite. In closing. You're the best one of the years. Guys, you're hope so. Boy. You're the best song to go. Yeah, that was good. Okay. Let's have a headache. That didn't look too good. That was Hollywood. Twelve minutes past six on say to four. There's an open line in the Broward. Please fill it up real fast. Don't you think that's amazing? That was astonishing. That technology has gotten so far. That's good. That it sounded like he was sitting there saying, Neil is the best talk show. It was devastating. I'm blown away by that to be honest. Joe. Joe in Tamorack, hello. I'm a man at gas oven terminal. I know. Was he good or what? He was a great call. Anyway, how are you, Neil? I'll tell you how bad the show was yesterday. He was better than 95% of yesterday's call. So what does that tell you? I could believe that. I know. Listen. I don't know what was going on in this town, boy, but something was to had a wild Monday. Anyway, why did I call? I told him. I told him. I don't know. I don't know. But you know, this one was right. I'm up with this hour. Good. Is that interesting? Yeah. That's a good start. Now what did you want to talk to us about? That would be the second question. All right. The one thing basically I was listening yesterday. I'm going to go to the day before. And there's some dead air on your station when you're on. That's not unusual. Yeah. One thing is I heard what was on before the delay. I don't know if that usually happens or not. I like I could hear the guys say hello kneel. And then there was dead air in the four-ounce second-liter herd on the radio. Do you want to mean? No. No. Is it something that I believed? No. No. There was nothing bad. I heard the guys say I could hear the bad boy. But the way you went on. I'm just saying that there was any dead air. And someone said something bad to put you to go on. Great. But you literally had to chill down. But if you go to a still dead air, because you can't hear the delay before. Well maybe the delay went out for a minute or so. That's possible. Yeah. Okay. Because I think I heard the one with time before, but it was no big deal. I just heard the guys say I kneel. And then I heard it on the radio. But it was like, oh, it's not even that kind of thing. Really here. I had that full of time. I had that full of way. Maybe the one with an iconic. Yeah. Well, we have these a little technical. The fugally is every now and then, you know? Yeah. Wow. But we got it all put together with rubber bands and crazy glue. It's okay. What are the things? Do you an accent make a request? Oh, my God. What are the questions to say something to some guys? Guys, Sean, I know. Doesn't want to listen to your show. Can you come with do you speak? Sean, who is obviously a subhuman douchebag? Better get with it. Because everybody in this town listens to the show. If they got an IQ over two. So what does that tell you about Sean, right? I mean, when you old points, you really hit rock bottom Sean. Okay. Good luck to you, Bill. Okay. Federal law prohibits us from the transmission of personal messages on the air, by the way. It's 6.15 on Zeta 4 and you see, what do they do when they make requests? Like that show on Waxi on a weekend where they do that every night. I love her. Only her. Some crap like that every night. Oh, I'm so in love with Rob and I want to say Rob, I love every part of your body. Yeah, you can get a life. Exactly. They put all that crap on there. And audience is listening from music. They don't give a damn if she loves Rob's nose or whatever it is she loves. Although I guess if she wanted to get graphic, they could probably get about an 80 share. Yeah. Anyway, moving right along, where we gone. Six and four lotter than boys. He got those numbers today or what? Hello. Yes, sir. I don't care what you guys think. You guys have a lot of listeners out here. And this early in the morning, you think? I don't know. Some people have to be in work pretty early like me. Too early in the morning. I'd like you to talk about 730 maybe and coming in about 830 and working to about 10 or 10 30 that would be good. Yeah, this is too much. Yeah, this is too much. Yeah, I don't care. I've listened to your show. I'll return to start on this FM and I'll always look you. Well, that's great. Boy, that's loyalty. Yep, man. I'm only 20 years old. I'm a pinhead. Great. Well, we're looking for young pinheads today. And now we've had too many old farts in the middle-aged misspits. We need more young pinheads. You got it. Okay. Have a great day. See you later. See, that's our kind of call right there. He was the definitive call. Now, who is this maniac who's driving all over the parking lot with his lights off? Did you see that? No, I didn't. That's something to get him. He was like, sip it all over the park. You won't see him there. You might as well save the energy. He just went that way. He went that way. But whoever it had was, he came whipping him here with his lights off and any parked in front of any back down, whipped around on the side and he's all over the place. Mm. I have no idea. What do you think? Look how tiny the box to me. We're just now. Did you miss it, too? Now, he's not out there. He's on the side. You guys keep looking like it. I hate to see you guys like on LA Law or something. One of those in anybody. Like, that's not a cop show. What is it? It's a lawyer. I know that. I know. I know. It's a lawyer. I don't want to watch a lawyer show. I thought it was a cop. Lawyers in love by Jackson Brown. That's what it is. That's what it is. I'm not interested in this. Not slandings on the Maranite. Okay. We're missing out on what? It's like a really beautiful sunrise right now. You know, I came out of a sick bed to come out of. Yeah, it's more. You do realize it. What is your feeling about the show today? What do you want to show? Yeah. It's a lot better already than yesterday. That's true. Yesterday probably was the worst show. I've ever had anything to do with. And 29 years have been in radio. Except that other day. What is he doing now? Did you crack yourself up? Captain De. I'm splurting. He just splurred it and orange all over the board. That's being like the tea lady. He splurred it orange juice into the board. Have you had a good time? Look at that. There's a little picture of Anita Brian growing out of the board now. I can't believe it. Whatever happened to Anita anyway. She's still squeezing fruit. They know. 16. What's that? Remember that story about about two years ago. She was found dancing in a disco with some gay guy. What? Green? 16 on Zeta 4. Let's move around. Thank you very much. This is the Dynamite. Six is the one that's flashing, but we'll surprise them. Hello. Are you surprised? I'm calling for vodka. Oh, you come from Boca. That's why I put punch to right up. You're on right now, beer. Oh, thank you. Isn't that nice of me? Yeah, the glass. I'm not. I'm not. I knew you were calling on the studio. I'm so sure. I'd like to be locked up with these colors for five hours going to South America. Oh, El Paso. And anywhere. I listen to you every morning. Great. Yeah, so I love your show. And I just get a kick out of it. And when I hear some of these colors, I just have to call you and tell you. Well, that's nice of you. I would like to be locked up with them for five and a half hours going to South America. And there's no where to go to get out of their way. I would jump personally. I like to go with this. Definitely do that. Thank you for talking with me. OK, have a nice one now. Bye, bye. Bye, boy. Oh, nice. A story is they would say on one show in town, a story. It's 619 on Zeta IV. We have an open-line and a brow at 7.7. 936. We're not going to rip standing. He just got married. He's got a new family. And he's on top of the world. It's only two beds that his audience lets him down day after day. It's a bitter disappointment. It's a bitter pill to swallow. That his audience is such a bunch of unfeeling, uncarrying mung brains. You know, taking care of your long these days, sure seems complicated. Big trucks, fancy service contracts, dangerous chemicals. You know, it'll seem so unnecessary. Especially now, when you can call on something as easy and natural as Kim though. Come on, let's go. Each week, the Kim dog will personally inspect your lawns. For weeds and crabgrass, he'll spray liquid formula number one. And for those patches where grass just don't seem to grow, your Kim dog will apply a special layer of formula number two. Oh, boy. Watch your step. That's all natural fertiliser. So if your lawns look and kind of shabby, unleash the Kim dog. For may not be the best, but we sure got a leg up on the competition. Oh, not a mash. Kim dog. Kim dog. Kim dog. 20 after six on Zeta 4 and we'll come back. That fit together with what you said before, by the way. It all worked. All went together. It all pieced together. Oh, hi. Go back right after this. Zeta 4 starts. And I guess I'll see you this Sunday at Metro Zoo, but I really like your shirt. But did you get a free moment with soup? Was that a one? No, I paid for it. Richard, I pay for everything. It's 24 past six. Now, what does this one is mama? What does that mean? What does that mean, Captain Dave? Hello. And I'm a comic mama. I'll have a comic mama. I knew it wasn't my mama. Right. And I'm a comic mama. She will never call this show and bear us me. What's that? Hello, you put that to your post. Good. You do it. Yeah. I just want to say hello. You got it out of your says. Not poop pack. Puppac. Puppac. Well, of course, anybody from Hamtramic wouldn't know the Puppac. Puppac. That's correct. OK. OK. I just wanted to say hello. Well, I was very nice of you. OK. OK. I'll see you in Poland, OK? You better believe it. Bye, bye, bye. It's I'll see in Warsaw, New York, which is an upstate New York, by the way. I just thought I'd mention it this morning, because I knew that would get a rise out of you. I'm so glad you did. 20. This thing that they've got me writing the messages on this board with. Yeah. It takes forever to erase it. So bear with me. There are no problem at all. I'll just punch him up. And you just, you know, pretend you're doing something useful. 25 past six. Here's the one. On Zeta 4, it's an erogish show on a Wednesday morning. The Eos under the weather and couldn't be with us this morning. It's auto. It's not great. He puts like two in date. That's helpful, isn't it? That's really very specific. I like that. I like that. Line two in date. In Neil? Yeah. I just wanted to ask you a question. How can I get young people like myself to listen to your program? I mean, I've been to over backwards, try to get all my friends listen to your program, but I mean, how can you get young people listen to show? Who do you think listens to this show? Oh, well, I mean, they don't really call into the show. Oh, I see. How can they get them to call in? Yeah. Probably like light a fire under or might be an answer. Yeah. Well, I mean, some of them like, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, I guess I, what do you mean by young, wait a minute. So what do you mean by young? Well, mid to late 20s. Oh, mid to late 20s. Forget it. Now, those people are hopeless. They're going through like midlife crisis at early age. Well, some of them have like chemical problems. They're going through, uh, yuppy dependency crisis or whatever they call it. Yeah. So how's my treat? Life is great, sir. If I didn't have this cold, it would be so good you can't believe it. Everything is wonderful. I got my house. You did. I got my house and everything is great. I know you're excited about that, sir. I have one for me. I'm excited. Yeah, he wants young people like him to call in. No, one of they can't go to a coma after 30 seconds on the phone. 26 past six on Zeta 4. Now he had good intentions. He just was a bad caller. 6 to 0, 3600. That's the number in Dave County. We do have a line free there if you want to rush quickly to the phone. And if not, that doesn't bother us at all, okay? And they're not. So that's, uh, just like I said, I'm waiting for Captain Dave who's allegedly writing things on a board and they're paying less than no attention. Uh, I don't know what to do. I, that's too much hassle using that grease pan. Why is that a work find before you never had any problem with it before? Because that's not what they give you. They'll give you with the board. That's another one. This isn't the right thing. No, that's what I'm saying. Well, I just punch him up. Don't worry about it. Okay. It's not a big deal. Why don't you just say on the air six, wouldn't that be easier? Because it sounds tacky. Oh, it does not sound tacky. It sounds like we're letting them on it behind the scenes like on the inside. They love them. They do. Okay, it's true. Let me get off mic then. Yeah. Number five's a collect collection. Oh, okay. From Jim, I do a Jim. Hey, oh. Oh, oh. Collect from where? Uh, the collection of a pompton of Beijing. I believe that. How can you call collect from. That's it. Oh, I just want to put it on. I just want to put it on. I'm from Tennessee, New Mexico. I'm not calling collect from Santa Fe New Mexico. I got to say this. This is the first caller we've ever had in the show. It doesn't aware of you. I'm trying to say that. Well, I was wondering if the beginning of the show used to the conversation was past day. And I was wondering if it really is. I don't know. I'm not sure. You know, this town goes in streaks and cycles. And I was wondering last night as I was lying there with the fever. I was wondering to myself, where do we go from here? I mean, if this is out now, we certainly are going to go back to heavy issues. Of course not. Because nobody wants to talk about that. Yeah, we'll go west over to Naples, maybe. Oh, to Naples. That's a real fun town. Oh, you're going to jump around with the Indians a little bit. Or maybe to Venice. That's a real worry town. I like Venice. It was a Gondola. Or the average age is 112. Venice Florida is not. Not Italy. Oh, I don't know if I was in Bunker or... Yeah. So how can I expect you to know from Venice, right? The world's conversation reached past day. I think with this call. Well, I don't know what you're going to say. Do I have to say something that you're going to talk to me? No, what I'm going to do is move on to the next caller. I think you so much forward joining us on WZTA. Your homegrown station. That's 28 past six on Zeta 4. We have an open line in Broward now. 7, 7, 9, 3600. I will say this at least they're calling this morning. Yesterday morning, I think we could have given away $100 bills. And it was just something in the air yesterday that it wasn't happening. By the way, is that our new slogan? Your homegrown station? Yeah. It's that homegrown cornpone down home home spun station. I'll work on that. And of course, all of us are from out of town, but that's just by coincidental. Channel 7. And like, are those people from Australia? Yeah. Your home town station? Exactly. I couldn't have said it better myself. And it looks like a crew from another state. They run spots on this show. You are aware of that, aren't you? I mean, it's one thing to live in a little bit. It's another thing to go on and on. Is it all we love them? Carry on. They run L.A. Things like Sally gives me fits and things like that. They run L.A. They run L.A. We love channels. Johnny Carson. They, yeah, they run L.A. Law. They said, police show. Yeah. They run cars. Kind of like not slanting is that airline show. Yeah. Oh, that's right. He's not giving me anything. He's a, um, what? Yes. He's even, he's even slow when he just does it off my, Miami Beach, hello. Yeah, thanks a lot. You're welcome. Hey, listen, I never would have cold in just to tell you this. The sense you brought it up, I thought I might as well go ahead and confirm it. Okay, sir. Please, it content. Please, starting this morning, you'll pick up a lot of listeners just because with all of you guys doing the same thing and went down, it really stinks. You get that constantly by people who are rockers like myself. Wait, wait a minute, wait a minute. Wait a minute, hold on a second. With all you guys doing the same thing, what does that mean? You turn on the radio and anything before 10 in the morning. All you hear is this crap. I got a zap you guys constantly. He's, he's, wait a minute, wait a minute, sir. Is what crap? First of all, this isn't the music show. This is a talk show. That's why I'm telling you since you brought it up, this is, has to say it stinks. Go to some rock and roll, pick up the rockers and stay with it. Pick up the rockers. Let me ask you a dumb question, okay? But yeah, since GTR is rockin' and rolling, playing all music in a morning, right? Wait a minute, wait a minute, can I finish? But they're not? I haven't heard it. I mean, I'm zapping between all of you guys trying to find a decent song in the morning. I didn't say they were playing decent music, but they're playing a lot of music. All right, since they're doing that and we're beating them already in the ratings by pretty good margin, why should we go and do what they're doing? Well, like I said, you brought it up. This is passe. And I just thought I'd go ahead and, if you'd be the idea, you know, that you, you're at least on the right track. Okay. Are you calm from GTR? Nice calm from sheer, I think. This probably is going like that. Yeah, I just moved down here from Tampa. All from Tampa. I'm born and raised here, but I just moved back down. Yeah. And it's hard to find some good music in the morning. Now, would you listen to in Tampa, Q 105? Oh, come on, give me a break. I said I'm a rocker buddy. Oh, I'm sorry. That's, that's a bubble. But you can insult me here when I, at least give you the distance. This is a Y and F listener. A Y and F. Yeah. Yeah, but that's all we got there. You know, well, so in other words, if we did play music, we still wouldn't play the music that you want to hear that's a problem. Oh, no, wait a minute. I'm not telling you what to play. What do you want to hear, AC DC and rush? Come on, buddy. I'm 26. I guess I'm using good rock at all. Like forner. I'll come on. That's not rock. See, that's what I mean. See anything that I would play. You know, I'll tell you. Elton John, you don't want to hear that. You can't use it. Go on. You wouldn't get that. Give me, give me, who's getting zapped? We're beating the crap out, everybody. Sir, what are you talking about? This guy just comes in from Tampa and he's a programming expert. Oh, no. The crap, well, you talking about reading. I don't know about reading. Don't know about reading. There's a rocker. Listen to the radius and this crap stinks. Well, what give me some group list? Give me some, yeah. Yeah. Austin, which is amazing. It seems to me you've listened more than one day, but that's okay. Well, I listened to the show. No, I know you just call it way out of hold for half an hour to go. Yeah, that was another point, but I wasn't going to bring it up. Okay, that's all right. But I want to hear some of the groups that you want us to play. Because if I said the music that I would play, you wouldn't listen to anyway. Well, you guys take good news. It's going to rest a day. I'll leave that to you. But, you know, as far as I'm concerned, the stones, the hood, Tom petty, pink Floyd. We play all that. Yeah, we play all that stuff. Yeah, right. That's what I'm saying. I'm saying it's going to be a good music. Just, just it's going to morning. I've got to drive in. I want to have to work and I'd rather hear music. Okay, we'll take a poll on it, okay? Yeah, great. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What? And he hangs up to top it off. In other words, he thinks that because he calls in the show his one call. Yeah. We're going to change the format this morning and we're going to go music intensive for the rest of the year, right? Well, we are. He's done his call. Are we just suggesting? I mean, is this guy out of his mind or what? Oh, he doesn't like for it. That's why I'm playing on him. Good. We'll be too poppy for him if you understand him. I'm saying that. Because they say in Turkey, yeah. It's a six thirty seven. I'd say the four. All right, though. The time at the sound of these eight or four ball. We'll be exactly a six thirty seven. This Sunday, March 20th. It's a set of fours. They always we go music intensive just in honor of that last caller, right? I mean, I want you to stop at think about that. Okay. The guy has just come down here. He knows nothing about this market. He's listening to the show, obviously. He calls in. He holds on for like 20 minutes at least to get on the year. And he thinks that because of his one call, we're going to change the format of the entire show, right? Oh, it was just a small request. Yeah, we just a minimal request. Why the hell can't we just to comply, right? So I'm going to take a poll this morning. I'll leave. Follow. How you doing, Lee? And I've already got his vote down for music. Okay. So this is our talk or music. Would there be another choice that I'm leaving out like maybe in the off position or something? Or dead air. Yeah, dead air. I bet you we can get higher numbers with dead air than Joey gets. Just the sound of that clock ticking. Just the sound of the clock working on the wall. Twenty-four seven, Boatai. I shouldn't be trying to sing with this voice. Should I or with any voice? But be that as a man. He was a good call. He just, a little confused too many mushrooms. I think up there in Tampa. Probably exposed to the Bob last that I'll show. I don't have to rot anybody's brain. It's understandable. Yeah. You say that. Okay. Let's go to number four. Call number four and oral springs. You say what? All spring. This is it. Well, I got to say I think we should go for an intensive and honor that guy. Yeah. That's why I played for him. I had a queueed up anyway. When I mentioned that he went into apoplectic fits. So I played it in perfect. I think it sounded great. I do too. There's nothing wrong with for another great. I just want to say I was driving home from Orlando the other night. I'm going to be here. The girl on WR on that. Oh, my god. Is she a trouxist or what? Yeah. And she's doing all this stick all night long. You don't have to do it. I figured out she's channeling. Yeah. You're doing the channel from my food and stuff. Yeah, but she didn't do it from another life. She does it from another day. She's Oprah Winfrey during a day. And she's whatever that is at night man. She is grotesque. Also on the subject of Don Johnson. Yeah. I mean, you know, Don Johnson, here's a guy that doesn't get along with anybody. That's right. The flat level. Yeah. People were. And then Stan gets himself all upset. And I know him well enough. He wasn't joking. He was upset because nobody from the Miami Vice show called him yesterday to congratulate him on his word. No. These are realizes when this serious is over. None of these people will ever work again. You'll never see any else. Yeah. Yeah. Michael Tads. No, I'm never get another job. They couldn't get a job at publics. Okay. And they're all too ugly to work at Windix. You know that. Oh, no, the worst. And the better one is even worse than Don Johnson is DJ. Oh, yeah. Because he calls Jay Michael yesterday and blamed you for stands ratings going down. What the hell do I have to do? I give Stan more promotion and the whole radio station does. What the hell is he talking about? And then he called Stan yesterday from the mobile phone and everybody. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. Hey, buddy. I got to do this for it. That guy adds about as much of that show as as the stuff we could scrape off the ground out here in a parking lot. Yeah. And mom, there's one thing that you all have to watch. And I was more it was great. You've got to watch the video tape of Beverly Phillips walking all the way. I'm glad you saw. I'm glad you mentioned that boy. So that last night. In fact, what we're going to be doing is we're going to have Beverly walking the straight way. And then we're going to be walking the straight way on the air a little bit of a show. And it's going to be we're all going to walk along with Beverly and point to our nose, man. That was the most embarrassing thing I have ever seen in my life. She wouldn't drunk. No, not at all. She was just a little uncorporated. I think. One time. What do you think of she weighs about 480? I would say she and Oprah ought to have a runoff. A runoff election. Okay. I'm good morning. You too. Yeah. I'm glad he brought that up. I forgot about it. She was not having a good time. Is it as good as she was having a good time, but not not finding her nose? Was it as much fun as that picture the Harold runs over? She looked even worse if you could believe that. She looked like she was in her night count or something. It was Bruce and man. The ghost of a circus pastor something. She was in her night count. It could be. 644. And I'd like to do a strip search on her. This sounds frightening. Let me say it again. How'd you like to do a strip search on her? 644. 644 on Zeta 4. And why do I feel like all alone now all of a sudden? Why? I don't know. It seems like everybody else is kind of like going in one direction. I'm going in another. You know what I mean? So anyway. What did you guys said about vice? Don't start nitpicking. You just need to look at it. Okay. You may not like this. He doesn't believe they're not going to get another job. He's just trying to be in fact. In the fact that the show sucks, which it does. It's going off the air and you take everything so literally. When you're going to lighten up a little bit already for crying it like yesterday. The guy made some ragdun him a little bit and he went into a dizzy. I mean, that's things literally. I want you mean by that lighten. No, right. See what I mean. He guys totally psychotic. That's what happens when he work at gloves 94 to long boys and girls. You become a total basket case. I think he's right. That's a very dark. Everybody should know. Yeah. Okay. Where do we go next captain basket? Number six and four. Waterdale. Four. Waterdale. Honey. Stick with the talk. Oh, a vote for talk. Wait a minute. That even stood up the last call. Didn't really vote. Okay. Is that it? Oh, no. Okay. I was requested to call in this morning by when you're last call. There's yesterday. Which one was that? One of one of the who me versus the tape. All this said. Good morning. Wow. Okay. I got this for out of you. He heard the end of the show. We finally got to the bit. And we congratulate you on nine consecutive days of mong. That was. Really. You come up with that much. It's really not. Don't know if you have a copy of this album. But. Yeah. I'll tell you. This ad has set new lows in broadcast history. Really have. It's been phenomenal. You don't know about the four or cut you played. Yeah. I think this morning a different cut would have been more apropos. Which which one would that be? All the dice. Yeah. All the dice would be good. That's cute. As it's that kind of morning itself. You can say it again. It's a great cut. There's a big thing in here that don't. But I heard you say that you know you can play it the first one you can definitely play it. It really goes for. You have to Dave. Yeah. And they say to bomb. Um-huh. Like. Some of the others are just a couple on there. Be handed. Keep your finger. You're facing one of the things you play. Yeah. Listen. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And thank you. Well listen. It's great hearing from you. Ed in stereo. Thank you. I beg your pardon. You can't take it. Oh. Okay. That's that's what they say on the beach. Have a great day. I'd be for graduation again. Okay. Our great American. Okay. There's an in stereo. I just can't believe the way that fit in there. Can you? Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And I was wondering if the Pope smokes dope. Well. And I tell you. You know you better quit while you're head baby. Some flashbacks. Yeah. Some blasts from the past. They're all these in moldings. Remember three with a bullet this week on Zeta 4. Okay. Where we going next captain, Monk? I got number two. My enemy. Number two in Miami. Hello. Are you doing to the knee? Pretty good. There's a lot of number two in Miami. Number two in Miami. Yes. There's a lot of mung in Miami. Yep. About your Miami Beach caller from Tampa. Oh yeah. We're going to uneven the scales here. Keep talking. Was he on the beach? That's where he calls for me. Moots from Tampa to Miami Beach. Oh my god. No. No wonder he's in a foul mood. Yes. He can't get enough acid on the beach over there. What is that? What is that? What is that beep on your phone? It's a recorded line. A recorded line. For what? For what? Hmm. Are you a cop? What is a bit program that you have? This must be a CIA agent or something. Who knows? No. Just a normal one. Okay. Normal agent. Well, listen. It's great hearing from me. I got your vote down. We don't want to stay on this line too long because we may be being traced. That's we are. Okay. Good luck to you, pal. You too. Okay. I don't get real nervous about that. We may find out our number. Hmm. We don't want that. No. We don't want anybody to find out our number. It's kind of like the J. Michael show. It's a 12 minutes before 7 on Zeta. We can get another call in before the news break. If Captain Dave decides, say you don't have to come too close to the mic. Five and four. Okay. Thanks a lot. Four. Hello. What's that? Can you imagine how we knew where that was? Are you in the Fort Lauderdale? Yes. Boy, that's great. He's not a target today, isn't it? Well, I'm not talking about the work. And I'm on my right floor. I believe that, yeah. Ready, man? We must have been a long night for you. Yeah, go ahead, sir. Hey, you know, Newer is the great talk. I'm the great talk. Oh, this is that same guy as we had before. Get on it. We were your police. I think I was junior. Was that the same thing? Was that guy junior? Junior? Yeah. I think so. Junior? I wonder if he's related to Walt Whitman. Oh, well. As in Whitman's sampler, it's 11-B-4-7. It's a little too esoteric for the soft-forward audience. Ah, y'all. And look at this, we have a story about our buddy, Don Johnson. Hey, pal. Well, whatever happens with Miami, Vice Don Johnson will keep busy. He's producing a pilot for NBC. He's recording an R&B pop album for CBS. And Vice fans, by the way, may also be asking what happens before too long. The seasons ending episode will be a cliffhanger. Boy, you talk about optimistic. Yeah, it really is. And before you go, can you do one short thing for me? What's that thing? Just say, freeze major Miami Vice for under arrest. Absolutely, I'm not going to do that. At Don Johnson. What a sense of humor. Some high-level Hollywood types are pushing for legislation aimed at protecting black and white film classics against colorization. LA lobbyists headed up by Bertland Caster and Jimmy Stewart made the rounds of Capitol Hill yesterday seeking support. They say the colorization trend is nothing more than a wave for modern moguls, like Ted Turner, to make a fast buck. They say riders and directors should have moral rights over what can be done to their works. Today is Jerry Lewis's birthday. I know you're excited now. I know why you're here. Jerry is 62 today. And smoking up a star. The movie director Bernardo Bertalucci, who's up for an Oscar for the last emperor, is 48 today, Eric Astrada. Oh my god, how old is she today? She's 39 today. And Nancy Wilson, of heart, is 34 today. So happy birthday. It's going to be a sunny and cool day. Heiser out 66 in South Florida, low to night, 49. Believe it or not, it's 43 degrees. It's cold. Stay home, kids. Stay home, forget it. Yeah, good. Lord 43 on Zeta 4, it's 651. Hey, come on. Stop to South making up. Before you break the law. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah. The Supreme Court of the United States is now in session. Just as Sandra Dayokana with this opinion. Baby, baby, I'm aware of what you do. Behind the bed and door. Now we're telling you what's wrong or wrong. Each night when you turn out the light. So next time you happen to the sad. Make sure you stay on your bed. Turn on. Don't worry about you. Don't turn off. So we're rehearsing you. Stop just up making up. Before you break the law. We both exist to free. You have no privacy. Don't turn over. Don't turn over. By the way, this is shocking. I know, but Mayor Bob Cox of Fort Lauderdale is just introduced legislation that if past would make it illegal for us to say his last name on a year. That's better. That's better. Incredible. In fact, one of the jucks in town would really be in trouble. 655. And I guess he couldn't even do the singular. I guess I would be even worse. 655 on Zeta for where we going now. Yes. No, we already did five. You can't be as good. Three in my end. Miami. Hello. Hey, don't. Pretty good. I'm only calling because I thought you might be interested in knowing the results of radio survey in a PC state. OK, we're listening with baited breaths, sir. OK. Well, we pulled off three campuses and they found out that PCC is too crazy about you. Great. In fact, by far, you have ordered the least favorite radio personnel. Excellent. We liked that. I thought you would. And you might also be interested in knowing that Joey Reynolds was also. Why don't I want to win you? But he was also rated one of the most favorite radio personalities. So. Great. Configured it out. Well, that says a lot about BCC that because Joey doesn't have any listeners. And they must all be in what concentrated in one place. Well, must be like an epidemic. Must be like an epidemic over there, huh? Yeah. So who came out on top, sir? Uh, I don't even know. Oh, yeah. OK, only new who came out on bottom. Oh, I don't even know. I just don't. You're named. That's all I got it. Yeah, that's said. OK, but you're listening archipel. That's right. OK, good luck to you, sir. OK, BCC. I always knew they sucked it with their anyway, right? I don't believe it. No, it's not true. But they still suck. OK, 6.57 on ZF4. That's how we ran on ZF4. That's how we ran on ZF4. That's how we ran on ZF4. Oh, come on. Do you believe that call? No, he wasn't. No, first there was no Paul Taken. I don't believe. Well, you know, it might have been like his girlfriend. Are you questioning the veracity of that last young man who called the show? Are you suggesting that he's full of it? Is that what you're saying? Yes, sir. I would agree. 6. 6.57 on ZF4. And our next call is in day from Latter Hill. Number four. OK, how you doing, Dave? Yeah, I'm coming out. Yes, sir. Are you doing this morning? You feel better? You don't go to BCC, do you? No, don't go to beer can't call it. OK, that's correct. I'm going to avoid it. We're going to shut them down by the end of the day, by the way. I don't go. Great, sir. Good. Well, you sound awake in a live and little bit too much. Oh, good. What you doing? So, we've been to the sea for two last nights, all three of you? Yeah. Yeah, that works well. That's right, nightly. I'm not. I'm going to ask you a couple questions. Number one, sir. Number one. OK, I know you have the window in your studio there, right? Right. And you look at everybody coming in and out, right? Right. OK, now, how is, how, where is Captain Dave sitting? Is he sitting across from you and a booth or something? No, actually, he's straight up above the ceiling. We have a glass window. You know, like in Vegas and Casinos? Right. How they have a glass floor? And he looked at what we looked up and kept the day was not. Right. Now, he's to our left. There's a window to our left. OK. So he's on another side of a glass. That's like he's here home on the phone, right? That is, that's correct because we have a Mickey Mouse phone system with a speaker phone, which is one of the most embarrassing phone setups for any talk show in the history of radio. Well, what's this Mickey Mouse phone? That's correct, sir. Oh, stand. Are you there? Yes. Oh, oh. Moller. And it's like, Glenn sits across the thing over here, yeah. Across the thing. On the other side of the board, we got it all fixed in your mind now. Yes, yes, yes, you know, you know, you have that mental texture when I'm listening to the show. Yeah, exactly. Right. And the other question is, somebody told me that they got a menu from the melting pot. Yeah. And the prices are expensive. It's not that true. They're going to like $18 for the entrepreneurs. Oh, get out of here $18. They're like, I haven't gotten a menu or anything. But I mean, is it reasonable? It's very modest. OK, like $8.95.95. Anybody who told you it was $18 for the entree is living in a dream world. They must be from BC shit. Very good captain, Mike. OK, y'all have a good day now. Bye-bye. Good question. Yeah, those were good questions. It took a lot of misinformation being spread out through a knee in the hinterland. WC2, maybe beat Ford Lodderdale in the palm. Good morning. It's the Neil Roger show on Cedar 4. And Neil's out of the weather couldn't be here today. Robert Q. Lewis sitting in. I remember him. Yeah. So do I. He's forgetting real little real old. Because nobody in this audience knows Robert Q. Lewis from John L. Lewis. Seven o'clock at the sound of the automatic bang. Oh, wow. What a talker. I'm pretty excited. Under the weather and everything. And he still hits those talk ups, man. When they write my old bit, he could talk him up like nobody's business. Oh, that was Ricky Tickie. No, no. No, this is going to be something about that cap. And you know something, he's still going to be wearing that cap when they put him in a ground. You know, still going to be wearing that blue cap. I wondered if we should buy a cap for Ed. What do you think about that? You know, was by the inimitable and never forgetable group David Peel and the Lower East Side. Yeah. I think you're right. I think he needs to shield his brain from any more damage from the whatever just from the sun. Something must have done it. It's a minute past seven on say to four, this be the New Rogers Show on say to four. And what are we doing? I'll keep you see. I keep waiting for him. We're all of us. The show is like how to sink. It is. Well, it wouldn't be so terrible if you would say something, but you just. It's a number one in Miami. Okay. That's see that would help. Okay. It's time for number one in Miami. Everybody together now. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you? Is Stan here? Yeah. Hello, Bernie. I just want to agree with the. Hold your. Your last day, color and then the last color. The color about the, some Tampa. Yeah. He's about five points below. Hope he would do. I would give him about six and a half. Okay. That's better. The top show. Just talk show in the morning. The best thing to hear. I'm. Since I don't know when. Yeah, see this guy thinks that when he turns on FM, it's automatically got to be music. And I don't know if that's got to be music that he likes. I can't help it. Most people early in the morning don't want to hear heavy metal or whatever the hell you want. You're going to take play, you know. Yeah. I'm going to take burst it up all the way and blow the ass of my mouth. Exactly. Great idea. Very good idea. I couldn't have said it better myself. Yeah. Well, that's bad. Okay. Well, you did yourself. Proud sir. Yeah. First time ever called any radio station. Wow. I've been trying to call last few days. And not regularly. Like you're not pushing the rebound over and over. Just every 5 or 10 minutes. Always busy. Yeah. I'm going to stay with you. Well, it's tough show to get through on some days. That's what I mean. Yes, yes, today would have been a good day to call. Yes, yes, yes. I was out of it. Yeah. And so is everybody else. So we're we. Well, thanks a lot, pal. It's a good suggestion. I hope the mung brain was listening. Yeah. Okay. Good luck to you. I'm feeling better. Thanks a lot. Okay. Two minutes past seven on Zeta 4 and open line and date at 6 to 0. 3600. What is it? See the next call. See what he did. I can't see it from here. I can't see it from here. In sunrise. How to help my supposed to see that from here. Oh, in other words, it's from tinkiers to everys to change. Is that what it is? I can't. On if it's from sunrise. Now I know why he left the room. Hello. It's not that bad. No, it's a person under 100 in sunrise. How to how to do it. 100 is right. Dave. I beg your pardon. This is Dave. Okay, Dave. I'm in sunrise. I'm living in breathing part of sunrise. Well, that's great. I didn't know there was such a place. Just go to the McDonald's and sunset strip and you'll be okay. I've been in there. They don't even have a drive through in there. Do they do they? Well, that's the one. There's another one up. Up the other way from that one. You're talking about the one down by university and sunset strip. Yeah, which one are you talking? Oh, you're talking about the one on the back road. There, yeah. Yeah, they have the. Anyway. I'm floating in this same area. Can a stoga? Is that can a stoda or can a stoga? Yeah, similar area. Mm-hmm. Um, I wonder if you ever went to Joel's front yard steakhouse? No, I didn't even go to Joel's backyard steakhouse. Now, what are you getting all surrely about? The birds getting all testy because we're doing more upstate New York trivia again. What is your problem? No to understand upstate New York is where it's happening. I'm not saying. I just had to. I just had to. Don't don't apologize. Don't apologize. Don't apologize. I just curious how long this is going to go. All this man knows is steak and shake and lakeland. That's about all hundred years. That's where he's that called. The other reason I call is no changes. No changes. Okay. No more music and intensity and all. In other words, you don't think for that one caller, we ought to change the whole format. He would, you know, I said, I'll take a poll. He got very testy and hung up as if he was trying to say, like, his one call should have been enough. We should change the whole thing because he said so. Mm-hmm. So what we really ought to do is talk to six people who are each going to have a different opinion. And then we'll be like sitting here at limbo because we won't know what they'll do. I thought we laid that all to rest long ago. Oh, we did, but I like to... I like to... Like a bad point. Keeps coming back, you're right. Yeah. Well, listen, thanks for the call and have a great day. And anybody from Upstate New York is wonderful in our book. It's 10 extra points. Okay, take care of Neil. You too. Bye, Bert. You said bye bye. I didn't see my point. Well, come on. Now you don't have to be silly. Just because he's not from Lakeland. The whole world can't be from Lakeland. Well, see, I was disappointed because he only asked about two places. You know, if you'd eaten it like two places. Oh, I saw the social media that I'm telling you. Many, many more. Yeah. Well, time would have permitted. I'm sure we could have done it. I may be with the next upstate New York collar calls. We'll do that. Just to make you happy. I appreciate it. Five minutes after seven and the weather. It's colder than a witches ear. Sunny and cool. High today will be about 66. And tonight's all again 49. Oh, this is, uh, the Lord. This is not permissible, okay? Okay. It's no, uh, say, permission. I'll key something like that. No, it's permittado. Exactly. And also, in a row. It's a 43 degrees this morning on Zeta 4 at 706. S.S. and Show de la mañana con New Rahers. S.S. Su cerebro. See, I asked for a quote. We got to get that Latin audience back on a show. We got to really work very diligently to do that. But they're over on radio, swave. Is that where they are? Radio, mom be. They're not here. I know that. I think they're radio, mom. Pretty tragic. I don't understand that. They're like 800,000 Latinos in Dave County. And maybe once, uh, an ablumule here from somebody. Okay. Once in a great while. We should broadcast live from like, I, Ocho one day or something. You know, we, we'd be live to start. Okay. Where were we going to go next, Captain Dave? Um, oh, there was a 10 past seven. A BCC student. On Zeta 4 was, um, one of the lets you know that she's a big fan of yours. Great. That she hung up. And it was, uh, and there was no pull. Okay. I think they could his climate of pull out their BCC. Uh, number two from Hollywood. Okay. Let's go to Hollywood. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Are you doing? Okay. I wanted to tell you something. I want to make a decent December. I hope you might not get back in March if you off the air. Oh, right. But uh, you're still on the air. We're still on the air, sir. Listen, maybe if you go away for about two years, you know, you never know. Just can't take it. I know. I like to know why you don't, because get you off the air. I know it's terrible. You know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's, but regular music on the morning. Um, regular music. Like what, what is regular music, sir? Oh, regular rock and roll. I want to hear you. Like they're playing on all these other stations. I want to hear this pop and pop and pop and pop and all these. Well, it's now 30 minutes. How long have you been listening to the show, sir? I've been listening to this for a specific day. Really? You're the one. Yeah, I'm the one. Uh-huh. Okay. I don't, you know, don't get me wrong. You're a nice guy. Don't get me wrong. I heard you on A and about a week ago. On A and about a week ago. Yeah. I'm a, oh, yeah. I remember him. And uh, you, you sound better on the A and. Oh, I do. I know. Do I throw my voice on A and some? A little bit. Oh, okay. But how about if I talk like this? What, what am I? Well, I'd make you feel better, sir. I might have to do the get you out the air. Uh, sir. The chances of you getting this show off the year on a scale of zero. I see like the, the reason the show is stay on the air or go off is because of ratings. You know, I hate to explain that to you and that other mung brain who call. And like when they were doing music in the morning here, they had about a 0.7. Okay. Yeah. And the last trend that came out, we're doing a 4.1. Okay. So which would you rather have? Would you rather have the 0.7 to satisfy a couple of mung brains like you? 0.10. About a 1? 0.10. What does that mean? It means very low. What does that mean? 0.1. All I know. All I know now that see there is the depth of expression. You're going to be one. Great. I'm going to show you my face. Oh, great. You're going to show us your face. I'm going to tell you on that call with that attitude. Who cares? Okay. So what about it? What about it? Maybe if I go to the zoo, you won't go on F and no more. Oh, really? Here's a threat from a macho. There's coming to the zoo. Yeah. Well, we don't want to see that, sir. We don't want to see that. No, we don't want to see that. No, we don't want to see that. Don't go to the zoo. Okay, Joey, see you later, babe. Who the hell is he kidding, right? They certainly jackasses out there who can't turn their radio dials. You know who got this? And of course, it's all a joke anyway. I'm saying. Yeah. It's all like one of those little setup deals. Oh, sure. Oh, sure. They won't give up over there. Well, I don't think they understand a man is down to a one three. And it's not going to do any good. I heard they've put now put billboards up and stuff. Is that true? Are they spending more money to promote a guy who can't break a one three? Remember the expression throwing bad money after good. Exactly. And this fits right in. We have a couple of traffic problems. Amazing. How does it fit in it perfectly? A bad roll over on 95 North at state radiative four of all places. This is causing backups five miles. Backed all the way up to Sheridan. Sounds pretty exciting to me. And Al says you can take 441 the term by core federal highway will be better. And he also said, um, it's a good data. Have your heater on in your car. Yeah. I think it out. Man, and Al has got more good advice. That he is incredible. I've been, I missed his advice like a couple days. Oh, stand. 713 on Zeta 4 on veiled threat radio. Well, we've had some great calls. And we got with a poll at BCC and this guy don't go to the zoo. I'm going to show you my ass. But the guy from Tampa. He was in. I forgot about what changed the format immediately or sooner. These guys from out of town come right in. They know what they do. They're only like what 40 stations in a market. And they can't find another one. You know what it reminds me of. It reminds me of the old winds see the old people and a lot of the young people are not that much difference. Oh, I know. Because the old people wanted the all news. Remember that? Oh, can we want the news back? Get him off. Now they never shut it off for a year. Uh, then I was over there doing mid days. Doing nine shares in the mid day. They never shut it off. But they all right to the bitter end. And we want the news back. And you're right. It's the same thing. They had no ratings. Yeah. Mid day. But all these people call it new. Now here they had no ratings doing music. Yeah. But all the people calling up now. But the music is always to be a public service to make a couple of mung brains out there happy. Right. And the music back on it is it's the same thing where we gone captain, Dush. Uh, five is unincorporated. Brower. Oh, that sounds pretty exciting. Hello. I knew. I didn't know there was an unincorporated. Yeah. This is unincorporated. I never heard of late. Mm-hmm. I would like. I could be better. I know. I'm just calling the let you know. I'm sick too. And scratchy voices. Which afterwards forward. Do. What would happen if you called in sick for the morning show? Who would do it? Uh, these other two mung brains here would do it. They would. Now this is happened before. Or man before. I don't get all pissed about her. I'm about to die from Tampa. I just feel like him. It's like I listen to the show. Now I really like it. I'm right. Yeah. Well, you know, people who want the same thing over and over and over again. How many times can you listen to Brown Sugar by the stones? Yeah. It's true. It's different. I like your show in the morning. I like it a lot better than listening to music. Yeah, me too. I'm looking for a while and then making educated decisions. Right. Okay. We'll have a good day. Hope you feel better. You too. Same to you, man. Okay. Bye. Boy boy. 715 on Zeta 4. And going back to that jackass. I call the couple of calls back. It's just astonishing to me. These young, uh, druggy, uh, A.O.R. listeners, you know, that if you don't do exactly what it is that they want to hear. They get all testy and put on this macho routine. I got to take care of us man. You won't be on FM no more. What a, what a total jackass, you know? The thing that amazes me is like if I go to a grocery store and I buy something that tastes terrible. You don't keep going back. But he can't shut it off because he's got his dial stuck on Zeta man and Zeta's going to program directly to him 24 hours a day or else. Oh good. Just like those wins, I'm Tonya's on every station or something like that. Like there are a group of people who think that the station owes them something. And they're going to cater to them 24 hours. Basically the people are either too stoned or too lazy to change the station. Oh, it's that is. Yeah, because you got to like reach over either a bunch of button or turn the dial. And that requires a certain amount of coordination and a certain amount of energy. Hmm. That I think so many people are lacking. 716 on Zeta and our next cool is, uh, Carol City. Like I said, it is Carol City. Hello. Yes sir. Okay. Now this isn't Carol City. Now this is one of those lines again. Can you tell by the sound of this line? No, let's kiss a cold up from the eye. I got a new phone. Yeah, you got a new phone. I'm telling you, you marked my words. Okay, go ahead. Just remember what I said. Go ahead sir. Hmm. Let's see what happens. That's a number in the cold. You fool. Yeah. Yeah. Because I'll get to my breeze out there. Some of your boys. Oh boy. This is going to be quite a confrontation of the zoo, huh? Simon and Garf Uncle might even show up. This is Carol City. Okay. All right. Thanks so much. Yeah. Now get rid of that fake phone. Will you please? I feel a lot better now. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to rest a lot more sound now. So 17 past 7 on Zeta. And we'll move right along Captain Dave as soon as you want to tell us. Don't keep it big secret now. 26 is Hollywood High. Hollywood High. One of our very fitting. And I was just Hollywood. Hollywood Hills High. Yes. Why should I know him? Yeah. How you doing? All right. How are you? Yeah. I was told about the guy called him from Orlando. Yeah. Well, I'm not from Orlando. I've been living down here for the past nine years. Right. And you got a great show in all, but it could do a little bit more music. Yeah. Yeah. I like to see every morning. And it's got a great show. But I don't know. But. However, however. All the other channels they do, they do all they do. Just play talks. I mean they're following your right along. First of all, let me say this to you. All right. I can name you instantly. A half dozen stations that are playing basically about the same music. I want to five and power 96. And then there's magic and wax. And there's Y100. And there's a GTR. How's the seven are? What's the two guys all day for the four man anyway? Right. Oh, rock and roll. So like that. Yeah. I don't know. I just listen to this. I'd like to. So that morning, you know. Yeah. Okay. All right. Well, thanks a lot. Okay. See you later. Yeah. I want to discipline. Do it. No. Yes, we do. Oh, good. I screwed that. I screwed that. I screwed that. And I started again. Sure. I can't believe you. We can do this setup again. What was I saying? We don't want to discipline. Do it. Wow. Wow. Okay. Okay. Just hold it right there. Okay. That's the new. Okay. That's the new. Okay. That's the new format on Zeta 4. I know music. What? Blue music. WGL you. Yeah. He sniffed blue. Blue music. I used to know people that did this. They'd like to make a record skip over and over for hours while they were sniffing glue. It was like something that they used to do up in the morning. He hung around with the hell of a crowd. He really did. Well, they do that up in the panhand. I'll be what the hell else do they have to do. That's who that is a good point up in Milton. Yeah. For a while. You didn't say Milton. Now, was it lapages? Glur was an airplane. That's the question. The plate lapages doesn't have any toxins in it. Oh, it doesn't. You have to have something like airplane or willows. Everything about like like Lloyd Bridges and airplane kind of right? Mm-hmm. He agreed. Okay. Well, listen. It's 20 past seven on Zeta 4. We're going to ponder that for a second. We're going to be playing a lot more music in the next hour. Here's Elvis and stuck on you. On Zeta 4. Okay. Certainly won't. It's a 720-3. On Zeta 4. Already? Something I was just going to do. And it just slipped away from me like you wouldn't believe. Something really important. And I was good. Oh, I know what it was. It just came back to me. Wow. How this sounds good. We'll bubble gum them to death. How's that? Great. It's just gummed to death in Miami. What a way to go. Hahaha. Okay. We'll open that up again a little bit. 23 after seven. I think I said that. We're going to take another call now. See, that's one thing I like about this town. And this town I think leads the nation in this along with the Herod��게issentasusted." Of course, it's forever going to be away. So we separate that. Not light. Straight. Shotgun. W reaching a shine. There's the은�� Maj奈kee. R伊 claiming in the land of my youth. tourists in Missouri loves company. You see the new radio station? Didn't see the new radio station in town. Ritmo 98. Yeah. A name for copies. Cuppies. Now what did that used to be? That rhythm 98. Ritmo 98. What does that mean, Captain? Here's Geno Latino. That'd be Ritmo. Here's Geno Latino. On Ritmo. It's on. They're going to listen, Mode, you think? On Ritmo. Ritmo. I'm not going to mind. The arbitrends, now this is an old story. This is in the Harold day. Yeah. Only catching up with things. You got the trends in there. The arbitrends, through much rolling average, the radio stations use as a tool to gauge their standings between quarterly arbitrends are out. Although they are not used to set ad rates as the arbitrends are, they do reflect trends that tend to be born out in the arbitrends. The most startling figures in the November through January survey of total audiences age 12 and older. In the Miami Fort Lottodale Hollywood radio market show the apparent toppling of former leader WINZ in English language news talk format. It fell slightly from the fall 87 arbitrends and landed at the bottom. I wonder if that's just a coincidence. Someone there seems like someone told us. This was going to happen. WIOD rose enough to cleanse the top spot. WNWS was in between. Isn't that interesting? What does it say does it say anything about us here? Do they just leave us out? No, we're mentioned, but you're not mentioned specifically. But like GTR and then we follow in the cheese number three. Right GTR is number one AOR. We're number two. Oh, they don't do anything about day parts. So we can't rip them because they didn't do anything about any day parts. No. They were fair. You know, it's a usual crap article you'd expect to read in the Harold. By someone who doesn't have a name, I'll be, oh, Lord Dase, Acevedo. That is the new radio record. I wonder if that person's related to Derek Acevedo, who's a jocky occulter. I'm sure. I'm sure she is. Lord Dase. She's the Gino Latino on Ritmo. Lord at Lord A is or Lord eyes or whatever name is is the new radio reporter in the Harold. It's not going to be so. We invite you to listen more to Ritmo. Okay. 726 on Zayn 4. Next call is from mobile on 4. Mobile. Hello. Yes sir. A couple of things. First I want to thank you for my ability to rip control of the phone and the radio back to myself and my kids. Listen to music. I drove into school. Now I listen to your show. It's more entertaining to me. Even though they're gripe. I mean, they can find music on all these other stations. What the hell do they want from our lives anyway? I think they want control of my radio and have to, to make more of them to get a sack until I find you on our family. Exactly. The second thing I wanted to give them advice to burn is when it was done at 100 times the saying is good money after bad. Oh. Yeah, that's true. Yeah, that's true. Like kind of going to the track, same difference. Yeah, yeah, there you go. Good luck. Have a good show. Enjoy it. Thanks a lot. Bye boy. Now today it's 27 after 7 by the way. But today is the day for all the malcontents to call in. If you're listening to the show, you can't turn it off, but you can't stand it. And you wish that the music was here, the same wonderful music that you're 20 hours the rest of the day on Zeta. We want to hear from you. Like we're Wolf and London by Warren Zivan. Little little lady, got mutilated late last night. Yeah. What a great line. 727 on Zeta 4. Oh, you know what? What? Guns are going to be at shooters tomorrow. I'll be gosh darn on the intro coast. For St. Patrick's Day is going to be broadcast in live from there. Maybe that guy will show up and give him a piece of his mind too. He says here he has lots of crazy contest for ticket CDs and cassettes. And it says bring us your rendition of Mr. Potato Head or you can make one at shooters. And I guess, guns is going to judge the Mr. Don't look at me like that. Well, now this sounds right to me. Yeah. You think it's like if anybody should know. Yeah. It's like because it's Irish. It's an Irish celebration. They want you to bring a potato. I can't think of anybody more. And shotguns. Either. Why do I have to be saying patties day everybody adds tomorrow. I'm Irish. And we're going to do something special. We're going to play four hours of you two tomorrow. Or is an idea. Organ grinder music. And we could play like Mall of Contire by Chroma Carton. Give Ireland back to the Irish. Yeah. You can play that by Chroma Carton. You can blow up a car out in the parking lot. And we could send a case of Irish spring to Rick Weaver. Great. Perfect. Speaking of Jeff Gunser by the way, Gunser's grilled a day of blocks from this is at noon. Rod Stewart speaking of Hayes people. We look like they haven't bathed in centuries. The police and Leonard Skinner. The police. Yeah. Uh-huh. And I see tomorrow we're back to two out of three again. Four-in-or-dire straits and Jeff Road dull. Do you realize what we just did a minute ago? What do we do? We just prepped for our show tomorrow morning. We have it all planned out what we're going to do. Yeah. You two for four hours. And if you believe that boy, the next time you hear you two on issue, it'll be a cold day in Brazil. In Dublin. In Brazil. Hmm. Cold day in Rio. Our next call is uh... Is probably in Miami. I bet. Hello. Okay. On time call at first time was there. I bet. We wanted to do that. On Sunday instead having an A and radio toss. Won't have an A and radio personality's toss. Yeah. I think it's going to run standard. You know, I really would both have a sort of depot warm. You know what I mean? I wish we could have thought of that sooner. But how about rusty nail? Yeah. It's great. I'm all for it. Of course, somebody probably get, what is that you get when you get the nail? You know, the blood poisoning. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can't let it go. I'm so on for the nail. Okay. Good idea. Too bad we didn't think of that sooner. Yeah. That is a good idea. Could have tossed Mr. Eagle around a little bit. Hmm. Paul Lyle. Jeff Charles. Arlene Roy. No, nobody can move that. Seven thirty on Zeta Four. And we do have one open line in Broward now at seven seven nine thirty six hundred our poll question today is how many mug brains does it take to make Miami? That's our question. In our next call is from is color number one in date county. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. Hey, how you doing? Okay. I got an answer to it. I think about ten. One to stay here and nine to come from boat and turn upside down. I didn't hear the, I missed you. I missed the first part. How many one? I said how many mug brains. Oh, I got you. Okay. All right. That's cool. You have a do you have your green cards or that's the question. Oh, no. Oh, no. You call me trace. That's right. You don't have to, you know. Yeah, obviously. Yeah. That word that word that you said a moment ago in a moment of frustration. Please don't say it again. That's all I would ask. Oh, that's right. That's okay. People feel so comfortable when they get on this show. They just don't know. Amazing. And they vernacular. Yeah. Captain David, no about that. Yeah. He's been on to a blurt that one out every now and then. Good points. Excellent. Come back. I think you're doing a great job. Thank you. As far as that, Perkola's mug brain, that called before. I think it's just nothing but frustration. And just keep up the good work. Okay. Red mommies rhythm and Spanish also. Okay. Well, listen, I'm delighted to know that. And, uh, Mo, Mo. I just made you day. Mo luck to him, right? Yeah. Mo luck to him for red momm. Okay. All right. Thanks a lot. What a good corner there. He had some pretty juicy things to say. 732. Too bad we could let him all go in the air. What was that? Oh, that's the alabura trying to get through again. Trying to get through from the twilight zone. Boy, the airplane engine was the sounding kind of. Yeah. Sounded a little bit funky to me there. Yeah. Sounded like that pilot on an airline that's Stan was ripping yesterday. Which one was that arrow Mexico? He was just ever plactic about the guy said he landed on one wheel. And then kind of straightened it out. And then he said he took the whole runway to take off from Mexico City. And Stan had a problem with that. And then Stan put that money in his luggage and couldn't understand why this. No, he did admit that it was his fault. Yeah. You just don't put cash and travelers checks in your luggage. Mm-hmm. Genuinely when you traveling, you were like a sports jacket or something. And you put it in your jacket pocket. That's a hang on to it for your life. You know where it is. Kind of like when you're gambling in Atlantic City. Yeah. And while it for dirt, you really do. I'm talking to you. That's a desperate place. 733 on say to four. Already. And he's getting testier. There's an eight line five and a broad. Hello. Yes sir. I can morning. How are you? Oh, I'm doing okay. New Pauls New York. New Pauls. Do you ever hear of it? That's like down in the Catskills isn't it? That's actually 18 up by the Grand of Hotel. Yeah. It was, I think, the drug capital of the east in the early 70s. I've got a good luck to him. Isn't that also where the mafia head of one of their meetings in that area? I don't know. I couldn't tell you. Oh yeah. I think that's. I got a bit of information for you. Okay. And now you're a big baseball fan. That's correct. And we're a baseball player. 10 will you. A vaguely. Yeah. He just checked out of the bat to talk to me with my amy. If the undergoing a cardio cast of the nation. Wow. Are you serious? And my very good relative performed it on him. And he's fine and he's out and he's doing well. Well, that's good. I just hope he quit shooting pigeons though, you know. He's got to stop doing that. Just thought I would share that with you. You do know that that when he played with the Red Sox all those years, one of the things that he did do in Deer himself to the fans used to shoot pigeons at Fenway Park. If I know you like to bring a little more of you to the morning, you've performed the part where he opened the morning. No. I just find it sometimes hard getting through this show, but getting up at the morning is no problem. Oh, okay. I just hear your throat. 10 to some morning. In a 10? What? Say that again. I woke up in a 10th this morning. As in like oxygen 10? No, no exactly. Did he hear what you said? He can't. I can't. One of the famous, I was Rubin shows. Oh, no. You've got to be kidding me. I can't take this. I'm already under the weather. You have to be. I was Rubin just picked up a new defendant. A four young fellow from the Army. I thought maybe it might be Willie Darden. Well, that's a dead issue. Okay. Have a good day. Thank you, too. I got about 40% of that call, but the end was good. I like the end. It isn't really another Ellis Rubin show. It does. Mr. Eagle. Oh, God. He's not in heaven. No shame at all. Thank God. But as I said before, you know, Paul died for what? Well, that is not listed. But Paul Is doing midday shows exactly what you used to do. It's like the old Neil. Today, at 10 a.m. on IOD, the top of his do lie detectors tell the truth. Very controversial. Yeah. Let's hook Paul up to one of those. The case you with the outcome is. By the way, speaking of Paul Lyle. It's been too long since we've lost track of our little friend out there in radio land, you know? 735. Hi. I'm so glad you called. I'm a guy in the tell you about the state that I had with this guy in Gary. Oh, yeah. He's a senior and I'm a junior. You got the 1982 he has a girlfriend. Those kids very senior call I have ever shown in embaixo, and they didn't say, things are going to have different would got so that because you know, honestly, you met that thing. And then up there that you never see you. I was suppose you should be in the and when you asked, right that is, you get the worst language for me. Have you learned any English language? After all you know, the learned language boundaries, and you know, a single dish, everything. Anyway, it kind of seemed like an interests for those in a school band. It's really moved. You know, I love it when a guy can move. And with his last one, somebody will smile and then when everyone left the stadium, he stood there and he looked at me and then he said, he really liked me a lot and just my lips. I'm going to die. I'm going to die tomorrow and I'll tell you about another fabulous date. You know, Amy is kind of like Michael Jackson in reverse, because Michael likes guys when they can't move. It's a... And you think tomorrow she's going to have a special St. Patty's version. I would think so, but I promise she goes out with Sean tomorrow. 737 on Zeta 4 will be right back. Miss Naomi Steenstein of Ciasid Long Island has a problem. Look at this face! I got more bad lines than a new Simon play. She needs the soothing moisturizing comfort of new oil of Oivey. Oivey! Blended from the finest chicken schmolts and choplitter. Oil of Oivey is the kosher cleanser designed to soften skin that's mussel tough. How wonderful! My face feels like every cell just married a dentist with a big breakfast. So when your skin's as dry as last year's mutter, don't pass over the blue and white box that makes your skins smell like a lot. I've made! No oil of Oivey is real good. Neil wakes me up in the morning. Neil wakes me up with a smile. We're the smile dad. Drinking my coffee, a bunch of nametong night. We're too full on the dark. Get ready to go to school with Neil. We're too full on the dial. I'm tired of working my whole with a doll. Neil wakes me up with a say to fall on my dial. Oh, really? Neil Neil Neil. Neil Neil Neil Neil. Okay, that's enough at I'd crash. 741. I'm sorry to fool. I was enjoying it. This show today brings back memories. But I'll tell you, just like those old days on AM a few months ago, when after having been on air for six, seven, eight months, and I would come on here at the beginning of the show and say, all the people who want the news about all news in midday, flash those lines and then they would all immediately just find up like crazy. All seven of those lines. And we got the same thing today. Let's see, March 12th. That was five months. Four days ago was five months. That's correct. And we've been here on Zeta and they're still doing the same thing. Yeah. Those music intensive, vannuckleheads. You know, I was so amazed how, uh, stand the other day, you know, did the news on AM. What an original idea. He did to give him the news back. Remember that day he did the news? Oh, you're talking about a few weeks ago. Yeah. That was pretty original. I was kind of like screenless Thursday. Mm-hmm. Now, do you remember one day last summer when you did the news? Yeah, very vividly with a teletype in the background. All those great stories. Yeah. Yeah. We could do that now. Yeah, we could do the news now. That would teach some of those young, long kids a thing or two, huh? I'm going to go get the teletype. Oh, no, I got the news right here. No, I sure don't. Everything we need, right? 742. This is a radio for idiots, including us. We don't want to know the news. And it is too, too depressing. True. Okay, where do we go Captain Dave? Uh, number five Hollywood. Okay, Hollywood. Hello. It's real quiet. Hello. Yeah. Yeah, no, it was Daisy. Oh, see, he was closed. That's pretty damn close. Look it on. You got off going there. You get on Sterling Road there and it can be David on one side and Hollywood on the other, right? Yeah, that's true. That is true. Yeah. I always tell you, if you're calling a Neil Sandman, they don't like the show and you know, you're so great. And they don't like the switch station. Yeah, see, that's the thing I've never been able to figure out. These people, it's like a dog sitting out and barking at the moon, you know, trying to get it to go away. And it's the same thing with these people. We're not going anywhere. The show is going to be here and we're doing great. You're right. You're doing great. You know, your son's the best show they have in the morning. Anyone wants some music with the station. There's so many, there's so many stations playing music. That's the point. I could understand it if every station on FM was doing talk. Where the only ones doing talk, I mean, Joey, got only knows what it is he's doing. That's not talking. But where the only ones doing it, why what is their problems? See, they can't adjust to new things. That's true. I think that FM is going to be a jukebox all day. Uh, no, no. Talk to the good, too. Listen, if I, uh, you're racking on the French stadiums. You're right. I had one of them driving the front of me. Drum 45 miles now and just surprised to stop the move. Road for no reason. Yeah, we're going to deport all of French canacons this week. I do open my job. The English stadium. Yeah. These French stadiums, that's why we might family move out of there. There are horses of a different color. Yeah, tell me. Like a horses' ass of a different color. Okay, listen, it's good here and from you. Oh, thank you, Neil. See you later. 744 on Zeta 4, I'm a chocan and puke and a little bit here. Yeah. That's that Stan Major disease. It's all over the building. Yeah, the other side only started doing it when he came back from his honeymoon. Have you noticed that? That you never did it while he was doing it. Now, and now that he's back in the building, it's like in the vents like Legionnaires disease. Yeah, some great adventure stories to tell about. Did he really? He was in the H room when I was leaving. It's, uh, let's see, we got an open line in Brower, which is really frightening 779, 3600. There was a rumor by the way, yesterday that was called in to be off the aired. You remember that? A rumor. And I'm not going to repeat it yet, but it's going to be interesting to see if some people show up here at the studio today. Okay. Oh. You know, which rumor I'm talking about? I told you, don't repeat it on the air, but I... No, I'm not sure. It's just good as that rumor that we got the last week. Some people are supposed to show up here. Which one is he talking? I don't know. I don't know. What? Anybody that was absolutely untrue that, uh? Oh, yeah, from the world. Well, you're talking about a Marlon Bailey rumor. Oh, she is. Marlon has a vivid imagination. That's the best I can say for Marlon, okay? Get's everybody out for plugged in. You mean something he said didn't happen? I know that that is frightening. I know. Are Marlon? I know. It's the staggering. It boggles once mine. Doesn't it? Now the other one I don't know. I don't know this other one you're talking about. By the way, have you ever seen Beverly Phillips and Oprah together? It's really something to think about. Okay, where's our next call captain? Three, my, my me Beach. My me Beach, how do you pressing? Hello. Hey, how you doing? Okay, are you depressed? No, not in the least. Well, that's good. Listen, I want to give you a call. I'm a very novice to the Miami area. And I turned on your show at the suggestion someone I was right? Because I'm from Orlando. You're from Orlando. Yeah. What a Mickey Mouse town at is. Absolutely. Absolutely. But I want to tell you that that guy that's dead from the neck up that called you really insense because I've never called I've ever, a radio show. Yeah. I want to tell you guys you're the best thing I've ever heard in my life. Thank you. That guy can go do something where the sun's on. And can stick it where the moon don't shine. Absolutely. Yeah, it's just keep on doing what you're doing. It's terrific. Thank you. And welcome to Slotterhouse 5. How's the J. Boyle Boyle? See you later. All right. There's a bad guy who catches on real quick. Real quick. Yeah. Like a normal person. A great caller. Well, that's because he's from Orlando. The people are a little more laid back. They're not as uptight and unfriendly and hysterical as you mean. You mean here. Orlando, like the one, the city right next to Lakeland. Tony Orlando. Now, the one right and doing. You know, doing? Do-one. Here's doing by the four seasons on Zeta 4. Okay. 747. I wonder if that doesn't do any damage. Does it call? Digital, isn't it? I don't think it does anything. It can just keep going forever. That beam can just stay there. We got to find out for like four to half hours. Like, let's put it on there. Let's see how long it'll keep going. Wouldn't that be fun? Well, I bet you Dennis Folder come whipping in here like a bad out of hell, you know? What are you guys doing? What the hell you doing there? We're doing a radio station. I heard him on the air again yesterday. Is he still doing that? Yeah. Don't forget, Legion, let returns Monday, none too soon, by the way. Well, they have to know it on Zeta 4. I bet Peter's happy. The only reason I'm coughing on the years. I just want the management people to know that I'm under tremendous duress. Okay, and I still come in here out of my sick bed because God only knows the crap that I would get, you know? He just got a little cold. He's staying home again. And I only just staying out too. You know how they get. You know, this management types, right? The ones that take off for days and weeks at a time. Although, you've seen ones that come in late and leave early, you know that kind. Okay, let's move along to line six. Always got a night in North Lauderdale. How you doing, Mike? How are you? Okay. I've heard. Hi. I have a great idea better than telling these two to change the station. And what does that, Mike? They get a stereo rate and all the records they want. Can play their own music. Yeah. They're own commercial. Yeah, somebody suggested that that they go out and, you know, put some music on cassette. I know I do that. I take a lot of my favorite stuff and I'd dump from CD or even the turn table on to cassette. And those days when I want to hear good music, I'll put a cassette in. Exactly. And if they want to hear talk and they don't like to talk on the radio, they can talk to them so. That is a good idea. They can tape it on the same on the other side of the cassette. And they can tape one end of the conversation. And they can have a two-way conversation with themselves. That's a very good idea. Yeah. You didn't get what that guy was talking about. I think the bird said he got like 40% of the what that guy was talking about. Yeah. Yeah. He asked you if you were found as hard when you woke up in the morning. Oh, I didn't hear that. Yeah. He said he woke up in a tent. Yeah. Oh, that's really cute. Yeah. I think that's a swishful thinking on his dad. Yeah. See, that was a, I was afraid that's what he meant. No, I didn't. I was out a little under the weather day. You got to understand. I'm just vegetating. I just let it go. In fact, I feel right at home in this town. I'm just vegetating. Well, listen, it's good here in front of me. And that's an excellent suggestion. All right, take care. And the answer is yes, by the way. Okay, it's not lately. Oh, okay. Let's see. We have one line open and Broward 7.7.9. 3600. And I guess we might as well get this over. Might as well. NBC led the week's neolson's despite preemptions for college basketball. The networked with the top five slots. Cosby was number one, even with the repeat episode. Wow. Still. What does that say about a number one? Next was cheers. By the by a different world. Night court and golden girl. Night court. Oh, God. To silly for me. Erin's way in new NBC series, starring Merlin Olson as the patron of an, uh, homage family, trying to cope in California, made it today, view at number 10, the best showing of the crop of new series getting spring trial. That little Joe, boy, I tell you, see. Great. This fog is ready to see more reality programming. That's what television executives call talk and information shows. Philip Corvo, the executive director of the National Association of Television Programming Executives, says reality shows are being offered for syndication this fall. Now, these will include shows like USA today, which will be a TV version of the newspaper. Oh, that would be colorfully. I guess it'll be in color. And another one called the Howard Co. Cell show. Oh. I'll get the shakes just thinking of this thing and about it. Yeah. Late night with David Letterman is going to London in May. Producer said the show will run from May 3rd to the sixth at the Victoria Palace Theatre. And Britain's have been, uh, able to catch Letterman once a week since last year. Well, but we'll have to wait to see the London version. Have you seen Edmort Downey Jr Show? I have one question about that. Now, seriously, I've one question. Worts it all about. Purdue the Robert Morton says they plan to do basically the same program over in London that they do in New York. And only difference will be the audience. Oh, basically. Sunny and cool today hides around 66, Lodonite 49. And it's currently 43 degrees. I'm saying a four this morning. Are you sure about that? Well, no, I don't think you can get through, but you can give it a shot because it is called. I'll be happy to go out and check this during the break, you know, like outside. Oh, yeah. You're right. Every time it's called, there's people dial a temperature. Anyway, I'll check it out. But they just turn the radio on. It's cold, trust me. And let us dial it up. Yeah. But last time I checked it was 43, I'll go check it again. But the last check, 43 on Zeta 4. It's 752. Okay, 755 on Zeta 4. Why did it seem to me like we went away for about a half an hour at that time? Should've seen that. Yeah, you seem anxious to get back on. Oh, I was. Yeah, this is going to make your day what you're about to do. So just go right ahead. Have a good time. Enjoy yourself. What is it that I was about to do? Well, go ahead. You see, was I right, guys? Is he testier? No. Alan and Mark came all the way over here from Cooper City, okay? From Cooper City High. They brave the cold weather. And your testier, right? You're upset. Why do you get upset? I'm so worried. I didn't say one thing. You are upset, you're surly. What did that mean about what I'm about to do? What is it about to do? Go ahead. See, I'm feeling a little under the weather. So Alan can't get too close to me this morning, okay? Which is probably just as well. I agree. Because it would be kind of embarrassing for both of us to Right, Alan? Let me do it. Good question. What's it? Are you taking drugs on the air or something? What is it? These are Los Angeles, okay? For my throat. Is that okay? Yeah, I just seen it get any more. Anything of this little man, just to pass it in your his nose. And he's ready for it. Anyway, Alan Mark are here and they're just going to kind of hang out. I said, okay, they're not going to do it. I mean, did you want to talk Alan? Right here. Hey, Darren. See, that's very simple. I like how he even waved. He could like sit on my lap and do the rest of the show with me. I could be like the ventriloquist. I could pull the strings and he could make noises. I'd like to watch that. And then my bitch would. Yeah. When do we start out? Anyway, what can I say? 756, if there's anybody out there wants to say hello to Alan and Mark. That's perfectly okay. Look what they brought for us this morning. Not strawberry preserved. Too bad we don't have anything to put that on. That was my first, isn't that exactly what I said? But that's good. They brought a not what he would you call his place man. Is that cute? But that's good not to bring anything to put it on. They went to McDonald's, which explains the state of mind that the man, I'm going to fold this up on the caroling before we. We were going to denies. Oh, you were going to go to denies. Like I said, I think you made the right choice guys. 757, not keep your clothes on Alan. Would you please because, oh, God, he's taken his clothes off. Okay, moving right along. Where do we go, Captain Dave? Next comes the shirt. Miami one. Okay, I'm serious. We could have a serious problem in here this morning. You do realize that there you may have to take over the show. What would that place take this close off? I mean, I'm just a mortal human being. Okay, I mean, Mark's and I skyd a one him to get feel rejected or anything. But you know, Alan is just like Mr. What is the word? What? Mr. Wonderful. Mr. Wonderful. Mr. Something. Yeah, I guess I made a wise choice, but I'm saying it on here. Okay, 757, where are we going? I got confused. What is Miami? Miami, how are you doing? Good, how are you? Great. I was listening yesterday. I did it every day. Yes, sir. And Scott, would you say Scott called? Scott called from La Bell yesterday. Right. And I was stuck in my car and it couldn't call you right then. But around the car, you can tell you about a place in La Bell. If he does come down, you should tell him to go to Floan, Ellos. Oh, it sounds like a winger to me. I don't know. I really don't know. Actually very seriously. There's a book and uh, wait wait wait wait wait wait. Hold on a second, sir. Did I hear you sniffling? Yeah, he's got a cold. And he doesn't even know it. Did my right? Doesn't it sound like he's got a cold? I think it might be myologist. Oh, thanks a lot. Okay, go ahead, sir. Because I was thinking of he's already gone a cold and it wouldn't make any difference if he said I'm my life. Go ahead, I'm sorry. That's okay. There's a publication. I think it's called the underground guide to Floan of eating or cooking or something. And it's, oh yeah. It takes you through all of Floan. That's just a little bit. Lessie Cooper publishes that. Yeah. Like, um, Mama loads and games though and Floan L is in La Belle. Wow. Is has their entry in or they have the world best baked pie. You can go in there at 8 o'clock in the morning and they have them sitting on the back counter. It's a real neat little place, you know, it's just an, it's like a little kind of drugstore and and uh, did you hear that? Can you get drugs there while you eat pie? Wow. But no, seriously, if he does come down, you should have them. I mean, every morning, fresh baked pies at 8 o'clock in the morning. You can get a hot pot and you can get them cold. Let me ask you why do I have to wait till he comes down here. Why do I want to? Would you want to dry it to the bell? No, he can go there and get him. I'm not going to La Belle for pie. Yeah, I'm saying next time he comes down. I might go to La Belle for a Scott, but I'm not going to La Belle. I said, I'm coming down. Not the next time he goes down. Okay, well, I get, I miss a new stand. No, not a little bit. I wonder if Flover herself is there baking or Ella's? Yeah. Yeah. Sounds like it. I bet you they are. I bet you're Flover now I put a lot of work into those pies. Yes, yes. Yes, yes. They're really kind of baking in their oven. I believe that. I was also, I was on all those things to that last little bit that you played. Got the woman from Siocic and he particular reason that she's from Siocic. I don't know. Yes. I've lived in Siocic for 10 years and I never ran into anybody like that. Yeah, well, she's done here now. See all the people like her who were from Siocic came here. Ah, that's the problem. I must have lost my accent. Okay. All right, well, just wanted to turn you onto a slow and ill. The next time you talk to Scott, talk to bring some pie. Okay, I sure will, boy. See you later. Boy boy, pie pie. It's 8 o'clock on Zeta 4. Hey, Neil. Yeah. I hope you beat me in the ring. You're better than I am. Even the competition agrees, the Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is the best morning show in South Florida. I don't get the nice year on an AM station as a hero in my book. Do you like same time as the quietest? You got no problem with me. Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on Zeta 4. Let me ask you a question. Can you hear that like out in the hall? Hear what? What's on the ear? What's on the ear? I'm asking them. Oh, no, you can't hear about it. You can just barely hear a little tiny bit of it, I got you. Now, can I announce it today or am I not supposed to say anything about why you're not in school? Don't say it. Oh, they're all in the market. Well, he was sniffling, wasn't he? Yeah, yeah, what's your excuse? I feel a little bit on the market. Yeah, you look a little pale, yeah. I think about 75% of the senior class. 75% of the senior class caught it. Listen, he's confident, choking and pew the. That must have all listened to Stanias doing caught it. That's like it. Yeah, you seem to be a little bit in a blue funk now. Me? Yeah. I'm just sitting here, minding my own business. Not bothering anybody. I noticed. What are you looking for trouble? No, we're just looking to have a wonderful time here. Well, great. And if Alan will cooperate, I'm sure a good time could be head by all. Anyway, where are we going here, Captain Dave? Um, um, a melting pot call from the floor. Four. Four. Yeah. What the hell does that mean? Hello. Yeah. Let me say it again. Hello. Oh, that's me. Hold on a minute, sir. You're the wrong call. I'm sorry. Would you try to straighten out your act in their place? Number two. Is he doing mushrooms again? An error one. Number two. Okay. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. Are you doing Neil? Okay. How are you doing? All right. Called you earlier. We're not on a recorded line this time. Oh, great. You called once before on the show today? No beeps allowed though right now. Wait a minute. Let me ask you again. You called early around this show today? Can you disconnect me? Yeah. Not a lot. These people understand. Once a king, always a king, but once a night's enough. Okay. We don't take second calls in the same show, okay? Wasn't that cute? Yeah, that was. What is he? What are they mumbling about? I give you a second. No, no. What are you telling them now?

She was calling from BCC. All right. Okay, go find some chairs out. And what was that, sir? That she goes to Brock Community College. Right. They'd appalled. Oh, really?

And the number one disjoc is morning man. Where, her piece of McQueen. Oh, my God. What if when I always write? Yeah, well, that's good. BCC is out for us, man. We don't want anybody over there listening. Okay. I never heard of that call. I was in two of a sudden talking about it this morning. Yeah, one of our bunch of mong brains. Those are basically a bunch of kids that can't get into school anywhere else. So they go to Broward Community College. I mean, next to anyone get to, uh, what is shared with more of a college or whatever it is. That is correct. They can't even get into vassar those kids. Yeah. All right. You know how I did morning? You too. I said, well, I'll break right. Audio, so we've had their, as they say at Windixie. It's 804 on Zeta 4. You'll have to excuse us because the bird is going as molting. What am I doing? You ought to open up a restaurant, call it the molting pot. What am I doing? When that be cute, I'm sitting here. Why are you getting defensive? And surely it's just a joke. It's just a joke. I'm not attacking you. Relax. You're getting his paranoid as he was yesterday. What is it? You're turned today? No, when was I parents? Oh, my God. Don't you remember yesterday when he was just foaming at the mouth? Because the one guy was ragging on him for coming in late. I just told you to go to him. What is that? You know, these guys are like talking incestantly now back here. We're on the radio. This is just a radio show. You're both sitting on the same chair. Well, I started to say something in you attack me. Now listen, if Alan's parents are listening to the show now, it's I'm sure that he's, you know, enjoyed all these years. Hey, Ron baby. But I'm taking Alan home with me today when the show ends, okay? What are you laughing about? I'm not joking. You're going, right? Anyway, moving right away. But he's not convey. He didn't say no, did he? Did he say no? He didn't say anything. Didn't say anything. So in other words, he's still there still hope where there's life. Anywhere you want to do the weather because Harrison is eating. What is that? That's Teresa's and Kibramran. I'm going to try to get a job at QBA. Hey, good. Hey, maybe you could be on radio.

You like it to be very calm and very peaceful, very quiet. The reason I had to leave Joe's last night because I could not handle the Kia. The Kia?

Is he going to? 10 minutes after you deliver pizza? Mm-hmm. Well, that's pretty interesting. We are on the air, by the way, but that's okay. Now, Tara was going to be here with us today, which I'm sure you would have been in a much better frame of mind if she was shown up. She's shining. She's shining. She's shining this. So now you're really depressed, right? That kind of like compounds the problem. That's correct. Is that called adding insult to injury? Yes, it is. Is that like good after bad? Yeah. Bad after he four good? Whatever. Spring ahead and fall back. Yeah. That's true. Alan had a pretty interesting. Now, what would you please try to control yourself back here? I know that you're just in an orgasmic state. Anyway, you were at the movie last night. The dollar movie. Now, where was this? How will a boulevard? On Hollywood Boulevard? Yeah. And? Yeah. Not to be careful with your choice. How will a boulevard in hiatus? Oh, yeah, I know where them is. Yeah. That said, well, they have, I thought they got rid of the dollar movie there. No, they got it back just for us. High school students. All I thought it was for the old farts from century village. Um, no, they just like try to get us in accidents and stuff and get in our way and drive like 15 miles an hour and how it will both are. Okay, now what happened? You were leaving the movie and something happened. What happened? Oh, you know what? Good until that story on here? You want me to take a walk? Oh, you said word, that's all. You cleared it up a little bit. All right, so I walk out the back door of the movie theater. And I figured no one else would come out of the door. So, and I have to call, you know, relieve that call of nature. So, I start relieving. And then someone walks out one door. So, I start walking one way. Yeah, right behind me, and you can see it in their life. And then I figured, well, I can understand that. I can understand that. It's a great one. Now that you mentioned it. It's a long way out. Yeah, the Sterlap and two. Um, and then people walk out the other door. So, people are inside of me. Some of them were crying. I'm really the one. They were jealous. Um, and then I'm relieving myself. So, so, so walking out into Parklight. So, and I heard them come inside this walk the way. Oh, I'm not, I can't, that's the end of that story. Okay, I can't believe he said that. Can you? I just cannot believe he said that. I know. So, everybody has lost their job. And I don't know what else going on here today. Well, I thought that these, this was the future of America here. Didn't you? Didn't you think that Cooper City was the future of America? I was. Yeah, you're going to college, huh? Were they, uh, doing the, uh, dorms and colleges? No problem. It's a 12 minute, I mean, like on the floor. 12 past eight on say to four, where are we going next? See, because basically the only reason you're going college is for you to drink a lot of beer. You're down. Where are we going? Uh, five. Are you, if you got a lot to join now or what? Nova high school Stacy. On Nova high school, Stacy, hello. Hi. Hi. Are you okay? Oh, my just started saying that you have a really great film. Good. Now you're not playing. I'm going to BCC, are you? No way. That's good. BCC is out on this show. Don't I know you? Do you know, uh, Alan? So I don't. He said he would like to know you. How old are you, Stacy? I'm 15. 15. Uh, six to 60. Yeah, he said six to 60 is his age bracket. So I guess you're right in there, Stacy. Um, I just don't even know that I love those little clips that you do. Yeah. Yeah. So I go to school and I tell everyone about them. Well, well, why do you have to tell everybody, isn't everybody at school listening to the show? Yeah, the thing on everyone, like I listen to them the way to school. Mm-hmm. Not everyone's like, it's right. It's cool. But people don't get right to school. So I'm good at the radio on the way. They missed that part of the show. Right. Yeah. Like, tell them all about that. So in other words, you're kind of like a, a, a correspondence. You're not really going to have to rely on your number to respond and write your testimony. Right. Right. So to speak. And my brother dying to school was, certainly lacking, all the way together. How old is your brother? About 18. 18. Mm-hmm. What is his name? What is his name? Uh-huh. Arik. Yeah. Alright. It's a good name. I like it. He's right. What are your favorite names? Why you laughing nervously? Great. I was on hold for like 20 minutes. Okay, not like when your brother drives you to school, does he go over 70 or 80 or? No. No. About 60? No. 58? He did a speed limit. Okay. Sure, Stacy. I know she's laughing nervously again. Well, listen, give Erica a big kiss for us. Okay. And we'll see you later. I thank you. Bye. At Stacy from Nova High, she was pretty nice. Wasn't she? Yeah. She was very accommodating. It's a good deal better. It's a 14. What is he doing back here? He's doing stuff with clothing. I'm telling you, it's going to be a very good thing. I got this cold. It's kind of like suppressing me at this point. We're looking for the Santa Rea house. We don't know what it was. I'm sure the bird would be glad to give you directions. Maybe you could have get there just in time for lunch if you don't. I'm saying. Oh, do you really? Well, we don't want to get into that. It's 814 on Zeta 4. And it's kind of interesting how they come in here kind of like taking over. Yeah. I have a good idea. Because I'm not feeling that good. Why don't we like, like, Mark sit down there and Alec gets it done here. We'll just leave. Yeah. I like that idea. I like that idea. Yeah. You know what happened. Talking about filling the old pants up. I mean, you realize how petrified it would be if we actually went ahead and did that. Oh, I know. Speaking of El Pantso, look at who's coming in here now. He's in general. He'll have a real program director's rose fold. I'm sure he would love Allen and Mark. Yeah. Hey, this could be a new show for you. Yeah. We'll suggest it. Rose. Yeah. The Allen and Mark show on Zeta 4. And they could play all that Russian Argentine. AC DC. Little Queen. See to me. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's take another call captain among six and Miramar. It does sound really tacky doing it this way. Doesn't have a lot of candy. We've got these big highfalutin computers in here that don't work. We ought to let people know why we're doing it. We can't even get a grease pencil that works. That's how desperate we are here. He's the party. They're because somebody stole my pen. Somebody stole his pen. What does that tell you about this joint? Maybe he can't keep anything intact here. Everybody rips off everything in his joint. Miramar. Hello. More and now. Hi. Are you doing? Okay. Hope you feel about it. I'm just getting over to morning myself. I'm just pretty sick. Listen. Have you ever heard of the Bigger Sons? Yes, I have. On the beach in France, flying forward by about 1965. I used to play that stuff on the air many years ago. Really do you have any copies of that? I don't know. I was going to send you a tape of it. I was sorting through my mom's old records and stuff. And I found these two. One was entitled the Bigger Sons fight back. And the other one was entitled Breakfast with the Bigger Sons. Yeah, they're great. I'm going to send you a copy. If you're interested, I will. Yeah. I'd love to have them. Okay. I'm not trying to put a plug for any political or anybody in the race right now. But just that curiosity, who might you be looking at the support? Okay. You say that over the air. Home out of looking. Be looking at the support? The services. Dale Murphy. I would say. Yeah. He's my favorite athletic supporter. Now, seriously. I don't like, I mean, it's just a joke. It really is a joke. And there are people all excited about the caucus. They don't know anything about the guy. And it's pathetic. And you know, Jesse Jackson's getting people voting for him, which means I guess it's OK to be a black bigot. But if you're a white racist, that it's not OK. And of course, Bush, I mean, what is there to say about the guy? Guys, it's a total douchebag. And a whim. Well, he doesn't even make good beers. So what can you say? This is correct. Listen, one favorite I like to ask of you. I have a friend. Every time I go over his house, he has his answer, machine. And if you saw him, it's incredible. Just like three companies, he's too gorgeous. He's a girl, putting with him. And every time I go over, he likes me to make different messages for him on the machine. I mean, what was wondering if you would make a message for him? I'd be delighted. OK, his name is Tim. If you could say something like, well, Tim, Jenna and Melissa aren't here. Something like that. What was the second name? Jenna. Jenna. Tim, Jenna and... Is that like in Bruce, Jenna? Correct. Did you ever hear that name before? Mm-hmm. What are people do like make up names as they go along? I never heard that name. And how am I going to do this? What's the number? I'll bleep it off the ear. Uh, I don't want to... I want to... I have a tape going on. What I was going to do is... Well, I see you're going to do it now. OK. OK. When you want me to start, I mean, between... Between now and 10, maybe? Yes, sir. Like it's rolling right now? Yes, sir. Just want me to do it temporarily, Sly? Whatever you'd like to say. OK. You ready? Yes, sir. OK. Am I ready? Hi. Tim, Jenna and Melissa aren't here right now. But if you do Spag so call us back a little bit later on, we'll see if we can't do our best. OK, Mung Brain? OK. OK, bye-bye. Thanks a lot, New Year. Have a heck of a show. OK, have a good day. OK, bye-bye. See, they always get excited if I say do Spag and Mung Brain couple of times. OK, they want them. They're jolly. I beg your pardon? I want a message, too. I'll give you a message. Ha ha ha. Where are we going to go next captain Dave? We have an open line in Broward, 7.7.9. 36 hundred by the way, just in case. You want to answer the phone? This man wants to do the show he wants to answer the phone. They just came in here, like we're not even here. He just raised his eyebrow there. What did that mean, Alan? Yeah, that's not what I think. OK. Why are we just... Why are we just... Hush up and we'll just listen to them. Good idea to me for... Yeah. I like to. Wait a minute, now isn't that... That's incredible. Do you hear what he just said? She don't look too bad. Forgetting about the grammar of that, OK? She don't look too bad. You said all you think about is that all you guys think about. You're like walking hormones? That's true. I go along with that. I'm going to wait a minute. I'll let's meet her at the door. On the way out. No. No. No. No. No. Oh, these guys, to these kids today. And I want to take some salt Peter or something and calm yourself down. OK, relax. I mean, it's 20 after eight. It's 20 after eight in the morning and you guys are hot to try it already. Can't you relax? I've just turned to an algebra and English and school school. School. I'm really burned against the worm. Um... I'm beginning to agree with you, which is frightening. OK, I mean, these guys are like out of control at this point. I don't know. They started out. They were pretty quiet and now they've become like apoplectic. They're out of control. It's like we're not even doing a show. Exactly. It's like there's nothing going on here. They're like they're sitting in school in gym or something. You know? Comparing notes. Wow. Something. I started to explain it to him right at the beginning and he wouldn't let me. So this is it. 20 past eight on Zeta 4. I think we ought to take a pole, don't you? We'll get Lee Fowler to come in. We'll take a pole on where the Allen and Mark need to be sitting on the outside of the window. OK, let's do a break cap today because otherwise we're going to get way behind. OK, and there's nothing worse than that on this show. OK, it's 824 on Zeta 4. Now you guys are going to have to shut up. OK, I mean, that's the bottom line. You're going to have to just hush up. You really quiet. OK. OK. Because he's getting really testing. He may fly out. Shh. You're right. OK, is that better? So we're like these guys stay until 10. Good question. Good question. They behave. This is worse than school. Yeah. Oh, yes. This is a radio. You can't screw off your guys. You have to be real quiet. Shh. We're serious. OK. OK, it's 824 and where we go next. See now they're going to just start making gutterable sounds. OK, just to aggravate you. Captain Dave, is he got to written down up there somewhere? No. From the infirmary of Jackson Memorial Hospital. Captain Dave, from the mental ward of BCC, can you believe that all BCC? Can you actually believe that? Yeah. That says a lot of them. Those kids, doesn't it? I can't believe. The loser plays that as they count. He, hello. Hi. Good morning. How are you? Pretty good. Good. Hold on a second. Get out of that Michael Waves. He's out there. We can do his little kids. No, no, no. He was trying to put something in the microwave that don't belong in there. OK, like what? A steel bowl or something? Well, you know, four. Oh, four. Yeah, come to turn it on high and see he'll get a real lesson. Hey, listen to these kids that are out of school today. Yeah, what about them? I think it's super that they're able to come in and see the culture that you guys are able to teach them because they can't learn this. Yeah, that's true. OK. One thing they might learn here in the next hour and 45 minutes is to be real quiet. Well, why would they want to be quiet? They should participate. Should get involved as a matter of fact. I think you ought to just move right on over. Oh, that sounds good to me. I'm ready to move right on over right now, sir. OK. I'm going to put Allen in my trunk and take him home. Never to be seen again. The kids nowadays as I drive by Marim or high school as I drive by the dairy school as I drive by all these high schools. Wait a minute. Let me ask you this. Is that what you like doing during the day? I'm not on my way. Cruise high school, sir. Come on. Why don't you admit it? OK. We understand. What do you mean? Well, well, well, well, well. I'll just go ahead. It was just a little joke. All right. The kids look so old nowadays. Are they talking again? Constantly heard something. Continuous. The kids appear to be so mature. So old. They do. They still work. Look at them. Yeah. Mark could pass for I would say about 22, right? 23. Yeah. Huh? What happened? An Allen could pass for by 15. I mean, what it is, is it the milk? Is it the meat that we're eating nowadays? I mean, why do they look so old? That is a good question. Isn't it? How come kids look so old today? We ought to do a poll on that. What do you think? I don't know. You know, I graduated back in the 60s. And I can remember what we look like. And this is nothing. You know, this is incredible. Wait. What is this? Is this a fake ID? What is this? 83. According to this, Allen is five years old. So I have to get it. Wait a minute. This is this is 052766. That means he's almost 22 years old, according to this fake ID that he's got here. Okay? With a different name on it. But that's good. Who did this for you? One of your friends made it? No. Me and my friend. Oh, you and your friends made it. Okay. I'll listen if there's anybody from the FHP listing. This will get him out of here. Is anybody from the FHP? I think that we're fabulous to have back in the 60s and the 70s. Yeah, I had one. Yeah, it was great. I remember the old A.O. House days back in South Miami. Getting into there was incredible. Do you? Yeah, you remember the A.O. House? No, I sure don't. Oh, it was great. In fact, I'm trying to forget it. Oh, okay. So listen, what do you think about this beautiful weather? I think it sucks here is what I think. It's crazy. Look at that picture. I look like Granny Og and a bad day at my driver's license. All right. So where are these kids going to go to college? Well, that's a good fake ID. I'll see that man. That's excellent. Where are they going to go to college? Where are you going to college, guys? You're going to see if I can get you. Oh, you're both. Oh, no. Not the gators. You're both. You're a gator. I was like in hang up. Oh, I hate the gators. Oh, don't. Even now, it's the gator. I hate the gators with a passion. Oh, man. That's the only university that has an entire fence around the campus. And that's to keep the animals in. Exactly. It's like, terrible. It's like a concentration camp. Awesome. Have a great day. Don't get yourself hooked up now. Okay. He's upset. He is really upset. Are you guys are both going to a Gainesville? Yeah. Actually, I'm going to Santa Fe. Like together. You're both going to the university of Florida together? No. He's going to the university. So he can get out a door. I'm going to Santa Fe because I can get into you. But I'll get into you. Put me. You understand what that means? Santa Fe. What does that mean? Santa Fe is a community college in Gainesville. Oh, community college. Oh, I see. What can't you get? Because you never go to school. Is that it, Alan? Yeah. And you carry around 40 IDs. And you tickle on the ground outside of movie theaters. We have, we have seriously. He needs some discipline. This kid. You know what I'm talking about? Mm-hmm. Some serious discipline. And I can't think of anybody better qualified to show it to him than me. Oh, my girlfriend. Cindy, Cindy, please be ready to listen. Oh, God. You're right. It's 29 after 8 on Zeta 4. We can't shut up because he doesn't have one. That's the worst part I know. We got a couple of accidents here. Oh, do we really? I think we have a couple of accidents here too. Go ahead. A five vehicle accident. Southbound, I-95. Just south of Sunrise, back and up traffic north and southbound as we go look at it. And also an accident on the Palmetto northbound. Your southwest state street, back and up traffic for two and a half miles. Going eastbound approaching the turn-pack extensions. It's a little void there. Okay, it's 830 on Zeta 4. We apologize for the interpret behavior of our guests, but they're in heat. They're out of control. They're also making noise in the background. What is he doing? He's messing with cars. Anything else? Should I look at while you're here? Anything else you'd like to inspect? Alan? Let go through the file cabinet. I got something to show him. Okay, where are we going next? Number two is John from Miami. John, we're doing names now. How are you doing, John? What are you doing, great John? Hey, doing, bird. All right. So I guess I'll just say about those callers today, huh? Yeah, we had some real winners under there. Especially the guy that said he was going to show up at the zoo or something. Yeah, and show us face. He probably fit right in there at the zoo. Yeah, I don't think he was up, you know. Maybe they could expand the zoo or something. Yeah, he might get his own tree. Yeah, with his own cage, huh? You got it. No, no, you guys are doing pretty good job, man. I mean, they won't need some music in the morning anyways. Yeah, and just as stylish as me, we're here to do a specific thing. And if there's anybody out there doesn't like it, they can get lost. Yeah, right. I mean, well, well, they're listening in the first place. I mean, you know, exactly. What do another? Because they enjoy the punishment. They like the misery. Don't you understand where we are? Sir, we're in the land of S&M. Yeah, I guess so, huh? Well, listen, you got to do a great job and just keep it up and don't worry about what they say. You know, they're one brains anyway. Exactly. That's what Jay would say. All right. We'll have an idea. You too. Okay. Thank you. What a good call or he was, right? Yeah, that guy was something. He was great. Oh, yeah. He was really something. He was really something. He 31 on Zeta 4. You're just upset because Territon came out here. That's all. You're just looking your wounds. Why is that? He would have been as docile and calm as could be. He'd be ignoring all of this stuff. She looked like Phoebe Kates. She has kind of that kind of. Yeah, that Phoebe is she looked kind of like Voyesh and Goyesh. Yeah, I was not going to carry it away, guys. I'm telling you, he's going to get sirloin. He's going to start throwing rotten eggs at you. You know, these are the kind of guys I would love to sit in front of in a movie theater. Oh, yeah. Perfect. You have the guy father. This and very closely for the audio. This is the kind of people I like behind me. Why do they have a serial killer? I said, why not just sit in the other. Nobody around us. I don't believe a word he said. He would have had a tanko on the ground outside the movie theater. Isn't that quite an insight. In fact, if you listen, when he goes in the theater, if you listen very carefully, you'll hear that same tinkling sound on the ground. Oh, man. They don't bring him up today like they used to do there. He's parents today. I don't know what it's all about. He used to whip him. I'm not, I'm not giving him anymore fuel. Okay, for any more dirty lines. Okay, where we going next? We have one of our boss winners on three. Oh, great. That's one of our co-workers. Hello. Hello. Well, he must be really excited or she or whoever was. Oh, yes. Oh, he must still be evidently, huh? He, uh, little bit. Listen, why's the bird awful quiet in there? Why is he quiet? He's depressed. He's looking his wounds. I can't, um, he can't function under the pressure. He's in females in her form to get him in heat. Yeah, that's the idea. We thought we had one coming, but she assigned us today. I don't function well, sir, in the midst of chaos, basically. Where's the last time you had your feathers ruffled? About two minutes ago. Yeah. The message question that that global traversal, uh, stuff like the ladies enjoying that accident. Uh, could be. Mm-hmm. That's the point. Listen, Leon, you need somebody to go with me at a trip. Well, good luck to you, sir. Maybe you want to go on. Maybe Alan would like to go with you. I don't know. See you. Now you couldn't go wrong. Alan. I heard Alan's in the other room. Leave him there. Okay. Don't spoil a good thing. Oh, you took, uh, they need the chair. And you took the, he took the, he took the rest of the chair. He took the chair. I can't believe it. Do you believe these guys? You guys take it over the building and I'll, They took Nancy's chair. Unbelievable. Frightening. Incredible. Why don't they go up into AM and take Mike and our Lean's chair is too well. All right. Yeah, you guys just go, you know, the building's yours. Have a great time. Take care of us and cheer. He doesn't need it. Yeah. He doesn't get staying up routine. How, how do we get this in our new? Oh, boy. I'm restraining myself. You have no idea. I'm restraining myself on that line. I know. These kids today, man, are incorrigible, aren't they? Yeah. You never know because you're looking down. He's got like this baby face and he looks like a real innocent doesn't he? He looks like an innocent young child. Like somebody would be just as sweet and, you know what I'm talking about? And he's just a hell razor. He's impossible. Am I right? He hit right on the floor. I hit right on the floor. He's just a professional travel maker. This kid. He's a maniac. If you have me in there, I treat you a respect or more. I did really well. Listen, now. With a chance of me sitting in, would you if I take a bite, take it. None. You're the shot. Okay. Well, this is not a great. I hope you enjoyed. I will. Okay. I know that. Okay. See you later. 835 on set of four. We have an open line of day and the number is 6203600. There. There's a couple of office. There's Laura Boomburg and a couple of ones. You go attack them or something. She is. Mm-hmm. Just to look up the word, Japping the dictionary. Anyway, it's a 25 till 9 on set of four. And we're going to take a little break here again. And during the break, we're going to see if we can't convey the message one last time. Okay. We're going to give one more call. Give it the old college try. Oh, you mean we're going to define the word. Quite convinced these guys. Now, Mark has been okay. He's been pretty quiet, right? Well, relatively speaking, he's been pretty calm and quite controlled himself. It's this other character here that has just been totally out of control. It's like a whirling dervish. Redefines the word hyper. Yeah. Are you hyper? Um. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Oh, yeah. That'll do it too. I didn't realize he had one of those. Do you want to go get rid of it? It's a 24 till 9 on set of four. And we'll come right back. Okay. It's 8.38 on set of four in the Roger Show and a Wednesday. We apologize for the chaos that's been going on here recently.

He just gave a lecture, a very stern lecture to our, uh, runaways from Cooper City High here, both little under the weather today. Of course, I don't know how that's going to fly. How does it, how can you be too sick to go to school, but well enough to go to a radio station? Oh, okay. Okay. Now who is this that you want to call? What do you mean by your ex girlfriend? Oh, yeah. Okay. What's the number? Okay. Don't see it again. Uh, I dialed a wrong number. I can't believe I did that. Okay. Probably didn't get the beep shot at that time, but that's the way it goes. It's a 21 till 9. On set of four now. We're going to be waking somebody up. Hello. Sydney. Yeah. Are you awake? I'm on one of the lines. We're talking to your Neil. Oh, are you really? Yes. You're on one of the other lines? I'm on hold for like 30 minutes. Wasn't this exciting? We're on the air right now on this line. I know. Can you believe it? I know. We must be a psychic thing, huh? What are you saying about me down there? He didn't say much of anything. Yet he said you were his ex-girlfriend? I know. I know. This makes me think everything clean. Oh, why there wasn't anything... I've been... I've been... You were talking about last night, Cindy. What? You know. Now wait a minute. This is a radio show. Okay. Don't go into anything dirty now, okay?

If you have to watch out. He's always pulling down his pants, Cindy. Yes, Cindy. Yes, you have to talk to him about it. He can't stop. Really? Like, meeting people? Well, I've never moved anyone. What is that going to start, Alan? Constantly, a daddy. He'll come to the big windows, a daddy's and him move. Like all the old people sitting in their eating.

OK, thanks a lot. The problem with Alom is that I would like to be able to have Alom, you know, like sitting real close here and just be quiet. Like stuff something in his mouth is shut him up. Mm-hmm. But unfortunately, I don't think it's possible. See, in life, there are all these checks and balances. Nothing is ever perfect. There's always some defect, some flaw. I know why you're sick now. Why is that? Look, the earth's demons try to above you. Yeah, there's that schmutz. I think I ought to suit, don't you? We all ought to suit this company because there's as best dose, as best as fibers filtering down from the AC up there. And I really do begin. I think it's having an effect. I'm cereal. Yeah, I think I'm getting like some kind of a mung disease from the Legionnaires disease. Yeah, right. Lawrence Ayers disease or something from the filter up there.

Boy, ask for it on this show and you've got it. OK? I've been asking for it, but not getting it. Oh, you're not. Well, there's a new finding and a poll of children's bathtub behavior. So many polls going on. And now this survey shows that most youngsters watched their hair first and then they bathed with a wide variety of play things. Now, these range from the traditional rubber ducky to plastic dinosaurs. This sounded the electric company magazine. It's when he's still talking. Oh, excuse me. Go ahead. Well, back, come on. Now, let's not crap out on the news here. Oh, I didn't want to get you to the way. It's your turn. I'll let you know when to stop. Oh, all right. You sure now? You want to do it now? I mean, you may have some of the talk about, you know, I don't want to, uh, and I don't want to get in the way. I think it's the way you were looking for it. That's what I had. Electric company. Yep. I think you're not. I think you're not. Go ahead. Come on. Don't be a good sport. Now. Electric company magazine. Hold 5,000 of a treatars. Eight, six, nine to get these bath tub in sites. 80% report they enjoy baths, especially bubble baths. And most said they wash behind their ears. Now these guys were like, what? 30, 35. The between six and nine. Well, I see. NASA says it has confirmed that the Earth's ozone shield is measurably thinning. All right. Space Agency says a 17-month study by more than 100 scientists show that the, uh, the, uh, the carbon Houston refrigeration and cleaning fluid. Not on the culprit. Come on. Oh, I have to say a chlorochlorocarbon carbon. It did. It was very good. That was great. That was excellent. That's the culprit. The doctor, you can't even have been inhaling them. So, you sleep. And my advice, star. NASA's strong. Uh, is hyponate. Now that's a Hollywood word. Someone who, he's hyponate. That's a Hollywood word for someone who's multi-talented. How are we spelling that? H-y. Yeah. P-h-e-n-a-t-e. How would you say that? Hyponate. Hyponate. Oh, I left out the P. You left out the H. Oh. They're working on a show called Flipside, which is a pilot for NBC. Then he's going to do an album for CBS. And, uh, and a quarter still Miami Vice. At least today. Isn't that what Alan said in back of the movie theater last night? I left out the, yeah. Sunny and cool today. Hi, about 66. Love it, like, 49. 47 degrees this morning. Is it positive now? Yeah. I'm, uh, yeah. Positive. Does that have a feeling this temperature thing could be getting away from us this spring? The show? Oh, my God. It means sort of like the show. Rap, track 20 hours a day. 97, 6, 7, 9, 7, 9. Rap, line just 57. 55 degrees. Yeah, you were only 8 degrees off. I don't believe her. I had the sinking feeling that she could be on. Oh, yeah. Sure. The sun is shining. How could it be 47? Okay. 55. On Zato 4. I think he just said a record by the way for, um, now this is exciting for inaccuracy. Right. Well, this has been our goal. She haven't, you haven't, you haven't got to excuse them. You're questioning that lady's baracity. Again, Zato 4. Hey, Gary Lawrence, by the way, at the 8.53. It's 8. It's 8.53. 855 on Zato 4. I was at. Oh, that's you now this time. Shame on not lost it. You told me, I was just wondering. You think that shirt is big enough for around. You could make a pup tent out of that for crying out loud. Now, you know he's over here telling me what news stories to run. Oh, you see? Yeah. You see now the news to run? Yeah. Tell me what to do.

This, I'm telling you, seriously, there is a serious, like, a little mental defect. I mean, he's got an awful lot to work with here, doesn't he? But if we just could, like, maybe beating with a baseball bat or something, you know what I mean? Is anybody ever suggested that? Maybe if they just hit you in the right spot, you just, you would shape up and you'd be like perfect. Yeah, you know what I'm just suggesting? I guess, like, anybody that looks that good is got to be, there's got to be something very wrong somewhere else, you know what I mean? We're learning that. Yeah, like on the inside. So here's a good lesson. All you young people listening, they don't let that exterior beauty con you, okay? Cause on the inside, generally, the better people look on the outside, the more screwed up they are on the inside, right Alan? Yeah, okay. 859, a WZTA might be beach fortlutterdale and the Palm beaches. I think many people have had the experience where they met either a great looking young woman or a great looking guy, but in two relationships and found out that. It definitely wasn't inside that counts. Yeah, that's what I was headed for. Now keep your pants on. Would you please, she said he was right man. He, I'm telling you, he's incorrigible. So many came in and started taking clothes off. And he's got this shirt on, that's like 16 sizes too large. So that's not 60. This is, this is, this small. A man small. It's just made, it's just close to me big. Yeah, that's a man small, like I'm a man small, okay? Anyway, it's 859 and we're going to go back to some calls. We apologize for the fact that the show has been hijacked this morning by a group of Cooper city terrorists. You know, it's 9 o'clock. I bet you they have stuff they got to do today. You guys have a busy day today, don't you? Yeah, we never bought it. You said it's 9 o'clock and he bet said you guys have a lot of stuff to do today. Got busy day today. He said you got to take a test later and you may want to like look over that before you take the test or he's got it. He's got all his numbers straightened up. Okay. And what was this about the John Holmes film festival? Yes, I already night in a memory of Johnny Holmes, we're going to have a Johnny Holmes film festival. You're house and your parents know that you're looking at these disgusting, perverted, pornographic films. I probably get the films for my dad. Okay, nine o'clock. See that answers it all, doesn't it? It's a baby. Yes, it's the 80s. We're all in this parents. Oh, geez. I don't know. I don't think I can continue with a show, you know? Now I got some stuff to do back in the office. I want to refer to the show I want to ask that, bring home for them. Okay. Yeah, I get a lot of work to do back in the programming office. Me too, I got to go work on my throat. You know, my cold. Yeah. We've got to go gargle into all of that stuff. So maybe we'll just kind of like take off now family these guys sitting here wondering what they'll do When that be fun I noticed that Rose hasn't come anywhere near the studio this morning. You can notice that? There's something to think about that is unusual. I wonder what that means He's been in the production room. Do I have? Well, here's here's a great postcard. I'm glad he finally did something useful after messing around enough just by accident Here's a card we got from Beaumont, Texas and it says Neil have a neat little spot to take Ed or stay out to eat. Let's have a bit more from Ed And this is from Thorntons trucks not Thorntons, but Thorntons truck stop diner in Beaumont, Texas And on the front of the postcards got a picture. I remember I used to talk about the white soup and red soup Well, this is the on the right. It looks like something that you would feed the cattle in his bowl Only this is for people and and the bowl in the left it looks like how it looked when it came out Okay, oh my god That's kind of an appetizing card isn't it just just look at that and think about that for a second Not This call Thorntons, but they just misspell it. Yeah, that's the way this Linda's kid. I guess we're in that place Okay, where we take on our next call can't we look at a gator fan on one? Oh, it's just hello I know how you doing okay.

I would think It's idea thing that's what sports fan is to put up a bumper sticker on their car That's their idea to support but I'll tell you something There's nothing better than being a gator yeah For University of Miami They have one soul in life only to be a gator hater They don't support their team. They just hate to get a gator Oh, they don't support it and support anything in this town is that unusual why should you of M students be any different from anybody else here? No, what it is they just live with an inter-seriality complex because when the gators come to Miami The more gator fans in the stadium than Miami This is true, right? That's a dress Good boy Guys Congratulations you go into a real college with a real educational program at a great sports center I hope it shapes him up.

Yeah, it's slipping away from us right. Yeah, and it's gotten really bad Well, it's all America's fault because it's those the odorants those erasols that we use right Well, not only that but that was my point. I mean Here we are with our president's leaders and it in a you know at a Time like we're in now and they're worried about building bigger bombs and this and that when they should be worried about how about the ozone layer Yeah, yeah, not only that, but so maybe I'll walk you know looking around out of water He thinks we won't die or the sun's gonna burn out.

Do you want to take credit for that? No, I can't take credit for that. I'm sorry I'm taking him home after the show and I'm gonna just beat him to a pulp Okay, I'm gonna just to whip him into shape because he's got he's got so much potential as a human being You know it's like if you were to if you had a manufacturer like Frankenstein you're gonna put a human being together He's got so many of the right parts in the right places, but unfortunately there are a few screws missing, you know, a few several many Now punch up another call like that Allen you could have this not now We got to do the weather now.
