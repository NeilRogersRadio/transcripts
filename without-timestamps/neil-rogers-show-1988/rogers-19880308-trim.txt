But today, he's so busy opening as a people's mail. So my flower era is here, this means this morning ever. Ever, much later. Oh yeah, yeah, I'm here, good night. Now pay attention, Kinder Schwein. Because flower era has an important lesson for you all. And you will listen. Yeah, always raise the number of persons girls. If you do see a very bad scene, and you don't tell them to vote, who could grow up to be president of Austria in just like mine's era. I've been... Science flu! No! Your time is run out, kill run! But we will be back next week, or next year, until next thousand years. Because we are the master of race, who knows and unraise us, and they're back in this world's wagon. That's right kids, it's Mr. Waldheim's neighborhood. Everyone will be my neighbor! Just a little excerpt from that, we make that they're shooting up on a four-loaded rail strip, where the boys are. 21 to late on Zeta 4, as we move right along, and we have another first-time cooler in Broward County. Hello. Oh, Neil. How's it going? This is Danny Electrician. Dave? Dan? Dan? Yeah. I do a Dan. Listen, I heard of the news last week, and the National Pro-Customation Week. Yeah. We had a little thing right. We did that last year, it's a real pain in the ass. I was wondering if we could possibly put off to a next week. Okay, so I'm going to meet you. Okay, good talking to you, Neil. Okay, Dan. Okay, we'll see you later. Bye-bye. That's right, it is. Just a little humor there, right? Yeah, that's a little, slightly teeny, we need a bit. But it is. That course it was Dan's first call. So what do you expect? I'm going to ask you, you ever seen Brian Norcross and Joe Johnson together with the same time? I don't think so. Okay, by the way, the Oprah Winfrey showed a day. We beat her in 17 of the weather girls. Each one looks just like Oprah. Amazing. I remind you of that. I just, every time I hear that, I think of Oprah. I think of Oprah. I think of Oprah. You know, she wears tents. She wears these big, flowing tents around her. But they make her look thinner. Don't you agree? Now, this is, this is what I was speaking of, Oprah. This is why I want you to do. When you're in Windixie next time, you're Windixie. I want you to walk around and look at the Mrs. Butterworth bottles of syrup. And tell me if that isn't the old Oprah. I'd be in 12th anniversary. The bag boy did probably. Yeah. I wonder why I don't have one of those from the bag boys that Windixie. It is interesting. But anyway, you check that out next time. You'll see she might be getting royalties for those. I don't think that's an ethnic slur myself. I did it. It's a butterworth. People from the NAACP ought to come and check in herself. Oh, is Mrs. Butterworth a, she blank? She's a white, old, and older white woman. Yeah, I think it's a brown bottle. Yeah, I guess Aunt you might not be white too. But you know what I'm saying? Go look at the Aunt you might have a bottle. I should look at the Mrs. Butterworth bottle. I'm nothing to say. Oh, thank God. 741 on say to four and a gator, better. Okay, a brown county. Hello. Hello. Come to the zoo. What do you want to say? Hello, you there? Yeah, we're here. He's under that. Just can't believe you said that. I can't believe they call us. You produce it with nothing. She will happen to that. Does anybody really care about this cast of Miss Fits? I could tell us. No, neither could anybody else. I need a big camera. Do you smell like that? I guess that's why you smell like that? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You're not going to do a request, of course. I'm not a request. Okay. I really may have a gator of nowhere. Gator of robots. Gator of airplanes. There's gator saying you're all of this house. If you take a gator of airplanes. He insists you're a gator of airplanes. Oh, my God. Your, your roommate or roommate needs an instant lobotomyser. There are a few people. Sir, are you listening to me? Have you taken the wax out of your ears? Okay. There are a few people who despise the gators more than I do. Okay. They make me want a pube. Or would he ever get that idea? Yeah, where did he conjure that up from? Was that from the school of Swiss football thinking? I am no idea. Yeah, probably. I think that the gator sucks. Exactly. LSU whipped their butt. The other day. Good. I hope they're being a by 85 points and ran up the score. I don't know if you'd see the gator. No, no, no. I don't know if you'd see the gator. No, no, no. Guys, give me very emotional on a season. Well, he should talk to my roommate there. They got me. I don't want to talk to your roommate if he's a gator fan. I don't want you to do it. I don't want to be the same building with him. Okay. I don't want to be in the same state with him. Okay. Send the gators to Mississippi. They belong over there. They're a bunch of redneck douche bags. Did that do it? You did it well. Okay. How many days? Okay. You two. Have a wonderful stupor Tuesday. Yeah, stupor Tuesday. I mean, anyway, hey, if you people are out there going to wait for your time folding. Why don't you get serious? Okay. I don't know what the differences are going to make. So the choice will be Jesse Jackson and Pat Robertson and November, right? And they won't blame me. And then we can all move to some wonderful country like Denmark. Or Holland. Thailand. Not be happy there. Would you really? Yeah, we drove by the a tyrocket restaurant yesterday. Oh, did you? I bet you were inside there when we drove by. No, I wasn't. But did you wave? Yeah, we waveed anyway. Great. There's the bird right in there. He's supposed to be another block up the street with us at the mounting pot. But he's an anti-social douche bag. I was busy. We don't want to hear about it. Okay. We want to hear about your fantasies. You and your Phoebe Kate's pictures. Okay. All right. 744 on Zeta 4. And boy, he's see. He never falls behind with it. Look at that. How's that? Good. Gonna get rid of the screen. We can trade it out. Hollywood. Hello. Good morning, Neil. I'm a first time caller. I enjoy your show. Oh, it's tremendously great. Great. But we just have an epidemic of first time callers. This is exciting. Well, this is an epidemic. You know, people will be getting to ask why I'm always pulling for Neil. But that's something I have to work out, I guess. We don't want to get in that sense. Neil, listen. I want to talk about everybody's show shows ratings and what's happening. Where do you see radio and self-lard or say by three years? Sir, you know where the tidy bowl of man hangs out? It's that bad, isn't it? Oh, it's pathetic. I mean, there's nobody doing anything innovative or exciting or new or this is just such a mug market. What is it, geriatric versus Hispanic or is that what's lacking or you have to do what? I don't know. I'm just a lack of ballsy management people. I just all want to imitate each other and all do the same thing. And I don't know. It's just it's stagnant. Somebody needs to come along and do something revolutionary. Well, I think you like maybe an all-talk station on FM. That would be exciting and revolutionary. And all of a sudden something like that that would have been like that. Maybe even an English to start. It's a start. Well, there's a couple of weeks. Anyway, listen. I enjoy you guys tremendously in the bits of fantastic. And I love the one about Stevie Nixon. He drove off the road when I heard her digitally reproduced mumbling. Yeah. That was fabulous. Anyway, thank you guys. Okay. Have a great day. This is a good call. It's first time callers new voices living and reading people. What the hell's going on here? And did you notice how he controlled himself and didn't make a request? Exactly. He did. He did. He did. He didn't. He didn't. Because I'm not going to play that anyway. Some of the have promised you. I'm going to play this all the way through. This is one of my favorite records. But this is in mono. And there's been too much water. You can see 85 Oprah's dancing around like, um, I can conjure that up in my brain. Hmm. Why do we speaking of total adieu spags? Here he comes ladies and gentlemen. The rose folder just drove in after goofing off for a couple of days. He was at a human seminar yesterday. One of those places where they teach out to be a human being. And God only knows he needs a little bit of work. And he'll be okay. Is he still in the car? Hmm. He'll be alright. What is that noise I heard in the background? How is that voice? Is that Stevie Knox or Stevie Nicks? Oh, is that Stevie Knox called this? Why did he run the area yesterday? She's pretty weak. Is she really? Where? She was on last night. Oh, I see. That voice is coming from in there. I thought that was just like an idle voice. One of those that kind of rings up and down the walls here at Z4. Seriously. They open at door in the atrium. And they're like, right away they get lost in there. Like the voice of Christmas pass. Hmm. Teas you to get. Or in this case the voice of poor impasse. Wonder how everybody enjoyed their home and tasha. Hope everything came out. Well, you know those poppy seeds occasionally. Yeah. I get stuck. Yeah, you didn't warn me about that. Okay, but like I said, no more food in this studio. Oh, good. Carry it. Maybe a little fruit once in a while. But no more food. Well, I bring something. I can bring that. Yeah. No, no, no, no, no. No more bigals. No more donuts. I like no more bigals. No more donuts. I like the bacon. No more pasta. No more pizza. Yeah, we did do it for a while. They're didn't we. No more tacos. Fine, what me? No more schmocos. No stone crab. No stone crabs. No cakes. No pudding. No pies. No pastries. Can you make it clearer? No hot dogs. No haver. No cheeseburgers from Royal Castle. I got to keep a looking for a day to no more ring dings or windings or twinkies or yo-hoes or Yahoo's. Now, so in other words, what you're saying is just so I'm crystal clear on. Yeah. No more crystal hamburgers. You don't want any more food in the studio, right? Yeah, right. Okay. Thank you. Okay. I gotta clarify that for you. Okay. Let's take a call from Miami. Hello. How are you? Good. Well, I just want to tell you thank you for that, mate. Is this Marlene? Yes. Boys and that grade. Yeah, we're kind of quiet last night, Marlene. Yeah, I know. I woke up this morning, but feeling too well. Oh, I'm sorry about that. You got a catching a cold last night. Oh, I'm sorry. Well, that's okay. I was kind of like in trans anyway. How come, oh. I mean, huh? How come? Well, I don't know. I mean, Rick kept uh, inching over and squeezing my knee. I don't know what he meant by that. Now, it's just a joke, Rick. Okay, it's just a little joke. Yeah. Now, money, low. I don't think she likes me. Um, I don't know about her. I don't know if she does either. She's very quiet. She's either very quiet or she just doesn't like me. She, I don't know. I don't know. But it was a pretty good time, wasn't it? Yeah, we had a nice time. We had a lot of food and it was so fat, mate. Yeah, and our waiter was, uh, what was his name? Brad. Brad was pretty interesting young man. Yeah, he was nice. He was very nice. And the Alan turned out to be quite an interesting collar. Alan. Don't you remember Alan? Don't you remember the two young guys from Cooper City, Hiro Kima? Yeah, the two kids from Cooper City. Yeah, and after they left, you said, boy, that Alan, uh, I would do anything to kiss his Muziza. No, I did, no, no, no, no, no. It's just a little joke, darling. Come on. It's just a joke. But that's good. You're not going to have any food on the stage in the air. Yeah, I got to lose weight. I got to stop this eating frenzy. You know, I mean, that was great last night, but now I got to take about a month's rest. Right. Right. Yep. So how did everybody like it? Everybody seemed to have a great time and enjoyed the food. Yeah, it was really nice. Everyone came home. That was so nice. Yeah, even Ricky said that, huh? Well, he's getting excited about my taken with a track. I'm going to, uh, he'll be a step away from bankruptcy when I finish with him. Oh, he had a, not like he's not already. Is he really? I don't know. I'll see that. That's my tactics. Yeah, I take those young guys to the track and I get to lose all their money. And then, of course, when they're desperate for bucks. Well, listen, Marlene, it's nice hearing from you. Oh, Daniel. Have a great day. Okay. Bye-bye. Oh, she's really great. That whole family is just, uh, such nice people. I can't begin to tell you. Oh, yeah. A 62 year old robbery suspect says he can't explain why his faults teeth were found on a Fort Waterdale street where an elderly woman was accustomed. While he was trying to rescue the woman from the real robber, his teeth fell out of his pocket, according to Joseph Bennett. No, he was going to gum the robber to death. A lot of the police aren't buying the story. They have charged the Fort Waterdale man with strong armed robbery. Un, believeable. And sure is, yeah, I wonder if he left his polo behind him. He's manager Bernard J calls Harris Glenn Milsted, a lovable man, hardworking and a talented character actor. The fans, though, Milsted is known as the outrageous, campy 300 pound cult movie darling divine. Why do you say is, did I say is was was I'm sorry. His manager says Milsted was often hurt. Felt misunderstood when he read about himself in the papers, described only as a transvestite star. As divine Milsted romped through such John Waters' classic says Pinkflemingo, Polyester and the current release Harris spray. The LA County Courner's office says he died apparently by a fixiation. He was sleeping. Why? Fixiation as fixiation. As fixiation. Polylexiating in his Hollywood hotel room. He choked in it. That's right. By the way, he was going to appear on the Fox TV series, married with children dressed as a man. No truth to the room that he found the other half of Mama Cases Ham sandwich. That is not true at all. Anyway, divine was 42 and we'll miss divine. Partly cloudy today, the high lady never knew to appear on this show. No, just mention that. You know, I want to rub it in. I think Greg's still trying to figure out who he is. Exactly. I'm not going to have plenty of time to kind of sit back in room. Today's high end of our entire time will be near 80 degrees and tonight's will around 70. 71 degrees this morning at Zeta 4 and at 752. The Rogers, the Rock and Roll monster. 755 on Zeta 4. Watch the bold and beautiful. You'll see this guy. Wow. Whoever the hell he is, he's on at Player Album. And for all three people out there who are middle players. Seriously, he's in the soap now. Well, I'm sure Dennis Waters. Dennis, Paul Waters. He will enjoy this all the time. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I don't know what I think. It all speaks for itself. Okay. Just stop the ignition. Yeah. Hit for home. My foot. Clock on Zeta 4, WZTA, Miami Beach Fort Laudernale in the Palm Beach. Everybody is cleared out, which is excellent because I've come up with a new techniques. You want to have the things when you're playing music. You know, this is not a music show. But back in my old days as a district, he wanted the things you do when you play music that you're really get into is you blast the music. It turned it up. You blast the speakers off the wall. And I've come up with a great new technique. Not when able to me to do that. That is when a pan and he asks other people in the building come in here and start talking. I just turned it up louder now so that kind of like sends him out in the hall and gets him out. They're in the hall out of the studio. Not to mention any particular names. I don't want you to take it personally. I enjoy the music. I know that guns are probably listening. I can relate to that. I want to be able to crank it up. Get into it and enjoy it. You know, feeling of the show. That's what it's all about. No. And I don't mind going. When I put music on, it's not a message for like the program directed to come in here. It starts moving. Because he's got nothing to say anyway. Or anybody else had a building to come in here and start. Yeah. Bye. It's your nice to see. I mean, this is a radio show. This isn't like over the backyard, France. It isn't. Or is it? Let's see. We did one idea, but I guess one good idea deserves another. It's the Susan Martin radio thought on WCTA Miami Beach, Port Flutterdale and the Palm Beach. Yes, the Susan Martin radio thought on nonprofit four hours of the Neorodges show to raise money for all the bottom. Susan Martin. And now here's your Jerry Lewis of software at a Neorodges. This planet will still destroy me in one minute. Hi. I'm so glad we've heard from outer space. Listen up, because I don't have a lot of time. 45 seconds. Did you ever have that uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach? The feeling that something hit is and frightening is going on in there? Like something is alive and moving. And look at your spot. Put your shots on my face. Oh my god. Hey. Well, that's when I take new fast acting alien falter. In neutralizes those nasty little acid-based monsters living in your stomach. So go ahead. Eat that extra crab leg. A sooner, of course, that is crab leg. Because you've got the fastest relief in the universe. New alien falter. It's great for what's eaten you. Okay, it's 8.02. I'd say it before. It's kind of cute isn't it? And I wonder what it thinks of that. Very much for playing that. Oh, God. Oh, God. Where'd that go? I just really, really need to miss out on the main floor. That other stuff. I think I did three in Miami before. But are you sure that's right? Yeah, I think that's right. What? One. Yes, you got a feeling. Richard, how you doing? Yeah, Neil. How you doing? Pretty good. Richard, how you doing? Oh, I'm alright. Just hanging out with me. Richard, Richard. Let me ask you a question. How you doing? Oh, I'm alright. You're saying I'm alright. You're saying I'm alright. Yeah. This is Neil. Yeah, Richard. Hey, listen. Yeah. What are you doing today, Richard? Oh, hi, bro. No way ever talks to you man. They always go anyways. Yeah, they ignore me. Can you blame them? You know, he doesn't have that strong, hot, so voice. You know? Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah. That's a Neil. A little wimpy here. What's amazing? Do I watch the playboy channel last time? I don't have the playboy channel. Sir, I have American cable up in plantation. I have that fascist-minded channel. Oh, yeah. Yeah, that cable system where they give us the sunshine network with all the distorted pictures on it. Yeah. It looks like your picture tube just went out. Yeah. What a bumper. Yeah. You can say that again, Richard. So listen, Richard. Let me ask you a question. Now that I'm thinking of it. How you doing? Oh, I'm all right. I'm just hanging out right there. Oh, yeah. Question Neil. What was on the playboy channel last night was, uh, playboy spring, spring, spring. And it showed, uh, sport-launched L.B. You know? Yeah, when there were people there, I bet. Oh man, you should see them with people there. And they had these banners hanging out over the, you know, welcome students to sport-launched L.B. You know? They showed all the, you know, great action that goes on. This is really interesting. You know, this show what it used to be like. Yeah, really. Reminiscent, isn't it? Yeah, right. Boy, those were the days. They still got it. They could maybe if you had it, you could have. No, I didn't have it last night, Richard. The bumper man. There were certainly some people to ride. I would like to have added, but just doesn't work out. You know, still have my life. Yes. Well, listen, I get my roommate here seeing how we're doing this. So, well, he wants to talk to you about your range or something about how far you get out. About my range. Yeah, just that one color called them. Yeah, which burner is it that he's interested in? Richard. You're radio. There's a radio station as that one color. That's right. So where is he Richard? He's right here. You want to talk to him? Yes. Okay. Thanks, George. Yeah. Hey, George, how you doing? Okay. Listen, you're radio. Yes, you're range of radio. Get out. We've picked it up this far. Going up 27 into more haven. Wow. That's right. I thought about that time. What happens is it's 95, 1F and 10. Let's start. I'll go. They'll operate on the same frequency. Yeah, we're going to knock those bastards off the year. Okay. They're made. They're going up. And that's, I can't tell you how far west. But, and I'll pick it up in more haven. You picked it up in more haven. Hopefully you can get rid of it in South Florida. And there's the real interesting one of this 50,000-watt boat torture that you're operating next door there. Yeah. Just before they get to the nighttime pattern, you know, in the twilight. Yeah. They, it runs real havoc with amazing up and making when you get up around 10 to call. Really? Well, that's incredible. So, I just figured you're letting it out. I bet you're all those people in Milton, Love Stand Show. All right. Okay. Have a great day here. Okay, Julie. All right. You can just calm yourself down. Please, just try to control yourself. Mm-hmm. Okay. This is such a frightening control. It's just a frightening call. I know. The stand made you show in Milton Florida. You boggled my mind, Neil. I know. Stand's down to a two in Miami, but he's got a 17-share in Milton. And he's big and two-agged. Yeah. Are you going to do the weather? Are you going to drink the coffee or want neither of the above? Partly cloudy? Maybe we could get her on the recording to do the whole weather. Then you wouldn't have to tack yourself. All right. How did they hit them are 80? We don't follow my insurance on crisis. And loaded at about seven. Great recording, Dave. How much will this cost us? 73 at Zeta 4. And it's almost seven past eight. Eight minutes after rate. And don't forget, colder is open now. Tropical at colder. And today is what Tuesday. I mean, they're racing at colder. Want to clock today. And every day, Tuesday through Sunday. And Tropical at colder, of course, offers you an opportunity to get out Plunge your brains out in real relaxing style. You know, we could look from here. We can see the Robbie Stadium right from here. And we just know that right next door to it is colder. And it really is my favorite track. I thought I'd make any money there. It'll get me wrong, but I just have a good time. And you will, too, because you'll enjoy the laid back atmosphere and of course, the great racing and a good food all through the track. And I have to say this in all honesty, many of the paramutual plants offer you food that is less than outstanding. Is that a very diplomatic way to put it? But at colder, no matter where you eat, whether it's in one of the dining rooms or whether it's up there at night. See where I like to go is up on the roof. The roof garden where they have those delicious, Delhi sandwiches, the Pestrami and corn beef and Martha makes all those phenomenal sandwiches for me. And, you know, you get your big pickle there, which is always exciting to me. And it really is great. You're going to love colder. And if you're, you know, it's interesting Rick said to me at the melting pot last night. He said, you know, I asked him, you ever go to the track. He said, well, I went a couple of times because I heard you talk about it and plunged my brains out. So what do you got to know what you're doing? Good idea. Yeah. So if there are any budding young would be horse people. And now, of course, they have to look like Rick, but if they're in that same general genre, I'll be more than happy to show him how to read the racing form and the program and get the scratches off the board and here, Phil Saltman, the screaming and wailing upstairs and a whole business. Well, can we? I'd be delighted to do that. I said, like, tag along. I said they have to look like Rick, okay, not like Frankenstein. Don't forget racing today and every day, Tuesday through Sunday, tropicalive colder, post-time 1pm. Those said, is that mean no, we can't. You would say nothing. We just become like behind it. 10 minutes past it. On set of four, we have a lively Canadian. It says, hello. Hello, who's this? Who is it? Yeah, who is this? Why is she putpick? I mean, waiting on the phone for an hour, waiting for a minute. I'm here at the corner of North West, to have you and North West 207.

Wait a minute. Take a breath. Okay. Take a breath. Now. I'm tired. I'd be waiting. How do I get to your place? What does he say? He's on a corner of 277th Avenue.

To get to you. He wants me to give him directions on a year. How to get here. Oh, my God. I don't know. I can't find a guy hung up on me. There's wait a second. I just know it. Just want direction. Go north to what? No, no. I'm a north west 207 street. North West two having. He was talking to me for like 30 seconds. And I was trying to go. Okay. Okay. Hold on. He was like. I mean, just a second. He's trying to say that I will. I'm going to tell you that. You're paying. Sir, let me ask you something. You realize there are thousands and thousands of people listening. This is a radio show. We're here to try to entertain the audience. Not to try to give it a direction. There's no lost Canadian. He's a man who picked up the phone before. He's like you said, unquote. I just want to get directions to your station to surprise the old Rogers. And he said, hang on. And I've been hanging on for about an hour. He never heard you say that. Sir, he doesn't know what they're talking about. He doesn't know what they're talking about. That's what he just said. I said I something dripping and wet. Yeah. He said that. He was dripping and wet. Well, sir, put it away. Will you please? I can't believe he said that. What do they think we're doing here? Oh, God. These Canadians boy, they got some past. Let's buy a one. It's 812 on Zeta 4. I cannot believe that he said that. By the way, today is stupid Tuesday and in keeping with the spirit of the day. Oh, look at what you did to this. When you do go running, you stop that fighting right now. My name is Romney. Romney hit me. That's because he hit me first. Get not did to these kids today. Give me a punch piece to play with and they just don't appreciate it. You're gonna be lying right now. You're a mad doggy momma. There you go again or we've claimed from us. Sometimes they make me so mad. I wish I could just flap them silly. I'm not scared of you. I got friends with me. I don't care because my guns bigger than your gun. This mother's day, I just hope they think of me. Go to jail. A public service message from mother earth. Go to jail, me. Okay, so that on a motivate to get out there and get involved in stupid Tuesdays. Yeah. Anybody out there voting for in Duke Kakka today? I am. Are you really? I'm not good luck to you. Our next president ladies and gentlemen in the first lady, Kenny Duke Kakka. That's going to be like flashback to the sixth answering the musical trivia question. Can Kenny Duke Kakka? Okay. Okay, moving right along. That Canadian guy got me really upset. What is his problem anyway? He's been lost. Well, energy and directions back to Toronto. I think it's fascinating. We had the tape of your, with you with another Canadian. That's after he called after that. And I think it was the same guy. I mean, it's just a feeling I have in my bones, you know? Ladies and gentlemen, it's a public service. WCTA radio is beginning the collection fund to send all French Canadians back to Montreal. And I'll English speaking Canadians back to wherever the hell they came from. I was calling for Maple Leaf Gardens. I thought of like one of the Maple Leafs. The main thing to me too. Well, Packious sandwiches okay. Well, even make them Canadian bacon. What the hell is Canadian bacon by the way? Well, just I've had it. It's just a different. What's cheaper? No. No, it's not cheaper. Oh, wait a minute. It's a road. It sounds like figure out. No, it's figure out. I'm talking. I can, that's figure out. Put them on hold immediately. You can't tell figure out when you hear them. No, that's not him. Yes, it is. One light is number two. Oh, that's figure out. Figure out. Oh, this is the embossed egg. It sounds like a mausoleum. That's not a big, that's not a big. No, it's not. Figure out. Well, for to the Dory sounded pretty good. Oh, you. Figure out Junior. Yeah, is this figure out Junior Junior? Yeah, figure out Junior. Yeah, figure out Junior. Something he's saying from a Minaret. He is working up to a go, isn't he? You're all right. So, are you looking for a figure out? Oh, can I? Can I? Go sick. I'm figure out. Good luck to you, babe. H-16, I'd say to four. There's an open line in date. And if there's any cheap French Canadians out there, we have a little message for you from all of our good friends in South Florida radio. Go to help back where you came from. Get out of our lives. Put driving two miles an hour out of the expressways. You're many. Oh, man. I make me nauseous. All you got to do is see a Quebec license plate. And you immediately know, man, you're not going anywhere. Mm-hmm. But I like the one thing that they do, they do is when they change lanes and they turn on their signal. They like to leave them on. And I like that. That's a good idea. Yeah. Just so he, he's you missed it the first exactly. And I think it's a great service. We'll see. They're conserving their physical energy. So, they're so damn cheap. They don't even like to waste physical energy. Because you have to reach over and you know, make a little yank. Just a little yank to shut them off. Uh-huh. When I was, after I landed at the airport, I hadn't been back in town for 10 minutes. And this guy was in front of me at a light. Decided he wanted to get back on the interstate. The light turned green. He started crossing across three lanes. Oh, yeah. All these cars were a honking at him. He was blocking traffic. Great idea. Yeah, good idea. Here's Chris Cross on Zeta 4. That was great. Okay, it's 8.7. We have a first time caller from West Palm Beach, Hello. Oh, Neil. How are you? You know, when the French Canadian was calling from 273? Why is that? The only 10 cent phone south of the world business. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. I believe it. And it was usually, Oh, he's at the airport. No, it's going to be a total of two. He was using two wooden nickels on his stand. Yeah, yeah. Rubbing together and trying to make a fire. If you couldn't do anything else. Exactly. Hold on a second. Hold on. Okay. Hello. Hello. First time caller. Great. Two month listener. Good. Excellent. Right. I enjoyed. Yeah. One at your top. You're right. All right. Question me 45 minutes on the line here. You chose the narrow. Yeah. What do you think? But at least you're out one of those cheap French Canadians, right? Oh, not at all. Send a back where they came from. I tell you, though, do you take a little bit of things? You'll like tell you. I believe it. Yeah. I tell you, you know, I have to tell you a little of stories. You have the night of winning to a bar. I've actually did. I've been in the West Palm celebrations, right? And I did a Polish guy. He looked at the end of the barn with this beautiful girl. But he didn't have the nerve to go over and talk to her. But now and later, I saw him. He was drinking beer and he got the nerve. He went up to her and said, you know, I've been looking at you all night. And you're simply gorgeous. I would love to take you home. And have mad, passionate. The girl says that sounds so nice. But I'm on my menstrual cycle. So the Polish guy says, don't worry about it. I'm going to have to call you. I'm going to have to call you. That's too bad. Pretty cute. Okay, but don't ever call her again. So we don't take jokes. But we liked it. It was cute. But we don't do jokes. Oh, my God. Now that was cute though. I was. In fact, he could call back and tell again. We have an open line in Broward at 7.7 9.3600. 7.7 9.3600. I guess I haven't talked about the pot, right? Good time. Yeah, it's a good time for the great taste for the melting pot. And again, my thanks to Dana and Brad are way to our terrific young waiter who tried desperately to spill one of those drinks on me last night. But didn't succeed. Listen, he could have spilled anything on me. What have been all right? But anyway, if you want, if you want a fantastic meal, nice atmosphere, reasonable prices. I mean, the food is so good there that everybody just gets like spastic. They really did. They start raving and dripping and drooling and rickies. Family was just, or gasmic. They really were. In fact, I was kind of embarrassed. They were all just rolling around together on a table. But we had a sensational time last night and you will too, and they're not three melting pots. We should mention that of course the brand new one up in what they call West Palm Beach. But you can you can bet your life on it is like, or it's at 344 South Military Trail up in Palm Beach County. And of course the same delicious fondue, the great Swiss and cheddar cheese appetizers and delicious beef chicken and up a seafood to dip in a peanut oil with all those seven delicious sauces. And then of course the dessert. Everybody, no matter what it is, I should also mention the chef salad with delicious honey mustard dress. But the highlight of every meal at the melting pot is that dessert. Milk chocolate and the white chocolate with amaretto and last night as part of the birthday celebration. Rick did stand up and did dip that banana in the white chocolate and everybody at the table was just owing and eyeing. It was astonishing. I was just breathless. And you will be too when you eat at the melting pot. It's as good as it gets. I'm serious. And if you've never had fondue before, you're in for a real tweet as they say in birdland. I shouldn't even dignify you. You know, you shine this last night to food was so good. We had a great time, but you know, nobody missed you. Anyway, as there are three locations. There are mile west of university driver just east of Pine Island Road on Sample Road and Curals Springs where big they used to work. They newly expanded location to 9835 sunset drive in Kendall where we had that magnificent meal last night. And the brand new melting pot. 344 South Military Trail and West Palm now. Why do mention that reservations are strongly suggested. So since it's already Tuesday. Seriously, if you have plans come up for the weekend, you probably ought to call now for like 3 days Friday Saturday Sunday. That's a great idea. Whatever. The pot. It's 21 past 8 on Zeta Ford. Did you, you got a mobile on two? Did you want me to do this for now? We'll do the mobile first. Whatever it is, you want Captain. Hello. Hello, New How are you today? Good. As the list is, there's a reason why the bird shines. The last night I think that England can can be congruent. Right. Right. Because last week we were talking about, I mean Jewish by association. And I want everybody to know that that Glimby came Jewish by injection last night. So my little Eidish to a fabulous and graduation. That course, the thing that is a bird and get it. Right. See you on Tech that break down Zeta Ford. I think we've time to take that break. Okay, whatever you say, it's 23 past 8 on Zeta Ford. Gons is really a million on the Jeff Gons show featuring. Yes. Neil Young. Neil Young. E. L.O. That's a good one. And Van Halen. So that's coming up a little later on today. You sure you're all going to want to miss that. Okay. Now listen, something we have to have. I mean, Miguel here by the way. I said a truck out there. I'm not sure. Because I want him to make a personal delivery now. You of course, don't watch those soaps. But this douche bag here on a left in this picture on the front of the player album. I'll wear a dangerous own. That's the one that's in the soap opera. Wow. In fact, he's probably on this album too. Is there a picture? Yeah, it's just a. This ball here. Yeah. He's on the bold and beautiful. He's a lot of really give it to him. How old is he? Okay. Because he's a mung brain. And that's a bad show anyway. That shows like a filler. Yeah. It's between the young and the horny and what's that other show? Is the world squirms? Yeah. Is that the one that dusty is on Brian Bloom as he on as the world turns? I know. I'm coming. Now you're supposed to be out of my area. I just, these soaps, you know. I'm sorry. The soaps are going to be really hurting from the writer's strike. That's right. They'll make it up as they go along and probably be better. They probably will. In fact, if they do it extensively, maybe they're actually, if they would only do them live would be great. Like they just say. Because then they might get a little bit excited. You know, they might get carried away and forget that the cameras are rolling and that that would be good. Anyway, it's 825 on Zeta 4 and there was something else I want to do. I want to make go to deliver those back to that lady in Hollywood. That's not that far away. She called earlier, but she couldn't hang on to see her now. Oh, really? Barbara, we're sorry that we couldn't get to you, Barbara. You're a great American, Barbara. She is. But I want him to deliver those personally because I don't want to put him in the mail. All right. Because they'll either get stolen or be. They'll break both of them by the time they get to Hollywood. Okay. Because not that we don't love our friends in a curiosity. Post office. But I think their favorite group is the staple singer. Boy, I never forget that period of time when we used to have money and cash and everything coming in a mail. And like half of my mail would be stapled closed again. Open by mistake. In fact, they didn't even put that stamp on there. You know, they were too busy opening the next one. Anyway, so just a little pointer. Don't mail your mail in the Carroll City post office. Okay, boys and girls, if you want to get it to the other end. All right. Let's take a call from them. For a lot of deal. Hello. Yeah. Yeah. My name's Vinnie. I'm from Brooklyn. You're from Brooklyn, Vinnie. Great. Hey, Vinnie. Vinnie. What kind of a lousy phony accent is that, Vinnie? Come on. Yeah. Come on. Yeah. Can't afford. Can't make you see. You can't. The deal with the people I work with. You can't be S.A.B.S. or Vinnie. Yeah. I thought I was the better BSer, but I'm not. What you got a lot of new walkers, where you were? Yeah. You mean, I'm up to say two. I'm from Fairport. Oh, great. That's why I'm here for a part. I can early with this morning. About Don and Bob, she got excited. He was ready to reach for those porters right away. I like doing you cut up that kind of thing. That was classic. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Send those Canadians right back. All of not just the French audience. Every damn one of them back where they came from. They're nasty. We have one of our accounting executives. Brian will get all upset. He's a good guy. We're sending him back too. That's all right. We're about to do you from. From the Brighton. Yeah. You're going to work around there. You're well, right near Don and Bob's. I went to elementary school right next door there. They're right. Right in elementary. I know the bird gets excited about this. You bet every time we reminisce about upstate New York, he starts gagging and his beak starts getting all nervous and chirpy and he gets hysterical. He's working around university. You know this. Yeah. Do I know this one? How he just continues on. Why not? Why shouldn't we have it in conversation? A quantum station? Yeah. What do you want to do? Talk about Lakeland and a steak in shake again? That's what he exciting. Well, every time. Yeah. I've got him Bob's up against your lousy steak and shake any day of the week you mung break. You and that guy holds his better than that. Exactly. We'll take you to Vic and Irves. I don't have a garbage plate for 350. Yeah. Exactly. We'll take him. We'll make you smell the lilac for clear or double. That'll open up your nostrils. Right? Right. We'll take him up to Cobb's Hill. And we'll put him on a water fountain. That's all. People from New York tell me I'm an apple, not good. All right. Tell us. It's. It's. Tell us. Yeah. Of course not because he doesn't have a brain large enough to get a word that big and his brain, okay? You must take the bat and the genesis you river. Yeah. Very funny. Tom's a take a. Don't say that again, but that's okay. You're not funny. Who the hell are you? You're Phil. Okay. What do you got me out confused on rattle? Are you taking a page from the Captain Dave song book there? Oh yeah. It seems to be a lot of that stuff going around these days. Yeah. And even see it on bumper stickers now. Yeah. And in fact Beverly Phillips has got a new bumper sticks as a bleep happens. I can't believe it. Paul isn't having great day fill. I will see it dotting bobs and vickin herbs and up at cadet cleaners and at the 12 quarter. I don't blame. I was the last summer man. It got up to least 30 degrees in July. I was great. I'll see you at Finger Lakes. Bye. Bye. That's wrong with that. What is wrong with I'll see it finger lakes. You don't even know what that is. You guys named about 15 places that nobody's familiar with except maybe you're basic raw chest to fairy. Okay. Here we go. I mean, what if I was to talk about months and or a pace? Okay. I apologize to those people. Some of them been waiting a long time. I just hung up on all the line. Okay. Now wait a minute. I just hung up on everybody. Okay. Clear the board. You know why? Because I want only people on the next half hour or so. I just mentioned, okay. See, I'll give you got you the call a tit for tat. All you upstate New York people calling and let Captain Dave have a dose of his own medicine. I mean, here's a big city slicker from Milton Florida, okay. He's from a town that makes two egg look like Manhattan, okay. And he's ragging on us because we have a lot of people from upstate New York out there. Look at the foam, man. They're going nuts. I'll punch him up. Don't worry about it. They'd count. He hello. Break. Break. Yeah. Yeah. Do you lose some money there? I lost some money there. I made some money there when I was going to school. Yeah. And I'm stating New York and Crate Thy probably keep going. Okay. Thank you. Baba. Well, there's one. There's one. You'll mung brain. You do spag. Or he is so full of what he said yesterday. It's eight thirty on Zeta Four. They'd count. He hello. Water town New York. All right. Let's hear it for water time. Man, when they have 40 foot trips of snow. Okay. And Masina. Uh huh. Carpet.

Then never in Stan Roberts and Robert Roddy and all those douchebags. Exactly. Exactly. He's great up there. Dick Beyonde. Yeah. And the, uh, the Houndog George Lorenz. Yeah. You go see the Rochester Red Wing play in Silver Stadium. The trade. The trade. The trade. You see the bus will rise in the trade. There's nothing. I'm telling you. There's nothing like sitting in Red Wing or Silver Stadium. It's called now. And having a couple of white hats with onions on a man. I just sit there and smell the aroma of the lilacs from Cobb's Hill. That's what life's all about. These people from Florida wouldn't know life if it fit on the butt. You know what? Okay. See you later. Much of Hick Redneck douchebags. Oh, I'm from Florida. Yeah. I'd be ashamed to tell anybody about it. I would hate to admit it. What on the end of the thought state? There's a big sign when you drive into Milton, Florida. You found the end with the hot. That's what it says. Okay. Eight thirty-two. On Zeta Four. Where did we go next here? Let's take another brown collar. Hello. Yeah. Speak to me. Um. I got the five classic businesses to put on my dashboard. Okay. I'm in the desert. Oh, my God. Where are you from? Okay. Uh-huh. Broward County. Hello. Hi. Yes. Okay. Crystal Beach. Crystal Beach. Where is that? Well, I'm going to say the other side of a buffalo. Oh, the other side of buffalo like for don't for Donia Dunkerk. No, in Canada. Oh, in Canada. I know it's a buffalo. Oh, and Ontario. What are you okay? I can tell by the sign of your voice. You're one of those minorities. One of the nice Canadians. No, no, what a buffalo. Oh, you're born in Buffalo. Another would go lost. They shipped you across the peace bridge. Kind of like that. Yeah, I see. The peace bridge. Is that right? The peace bridge. Okay. I cut it. I cut it. What is it? Daddy, cut it. How about, uh, let's see. What do they got in Buffalo that I like Mike subs? And chicken wings. Yeah. They're big on chicken wings of Buffalo, aren't they? Uh-huh. Because they got all those Polish people up there. And that's all they can eat. Is chicken wings. Right. But what I'm going to do. We're going to hang for it. La la de la. And have a mask. You know? Evidently. Yeah. Sounds good. Okay. Bye, boy. Bye. I see that we're getting a just a flood of upstate New Yorkers here and you people. Dude. I think it's like some kind of a game or some kind of a joke. This is what real life is all about. Speaking of that, here's J. Michaels in his, uh, the last day for his Tiffany. Wow. And the my Tiffany should be arriving at about 10 o'clock this morning. I just mentioned that in past. Should be. Yeah. Hopefully. I mean, it's desperate. It's like now or never. Now who the hell is that that just drove in there? And that candlelight sales person. Right behind you. Brian. Brian. Is that a Canadian American? I'm talking Canadian. Yeah. That's our token minority Canadian. We had a higher one Canadian on the staff. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's a good guy. Oh, yeah. It needs to get rid of that Canadian background. It's a 834. Haha. Look at those lines flashing. Men are flashing like a Hanukkah bush. This is what life is all about. I'm trying to tell you is a white hot at Don and Bob's a trip to a finger Lake to plunge your brains out. Then a little trip on the through way to Batavia down's at night. For those one to five shots. And even Fred shots never saw such shots. As you'll see at Batavia down's I actually won money there every night when I was on vacation. I know that's shot. Shotking. And I don't want to get Ricky all upset there about the track. It is hopes up because it's you know one of those things. If you take 10 20 thousand with your Ricky got to be ready to lose it. 834 on Zeta 4 and not don't stop bringing a phone. Just let him keep bringing away what call of a screenless Tuesday. Oh, that's a really interesting thing that I dreamed of that idea. Just letting the phones flash and all of a sudden it became a screenless. Thursday, the meatless Friday and a mungless Tuesday. We don't have a screen today. So it's kind of a pro. Yeah, it sure is. Okay. Now don't you go out in the sun as Alibar would say. Be sure to use screen number three today because the sun is picking through those high clouds up in the sky.
