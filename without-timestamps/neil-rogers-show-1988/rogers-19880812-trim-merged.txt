Okay. The lineup. Neil and the Warren. Captain Dave and the Bird mid-days. Stan and Johnny Dark in the afternoon. I'm cold. It never happens, sir. It will never happen. That's what M.I.R. would have been incredible. The interesting, fascinating suggestion. Great suggestion. Okay. One more thing. Thing is, Neil can't work by himself. Don't think so. No. I'm angry. Are you kidding all that? If he knew you say that. Let me let me let me let me let me. Let me let me let me. Let me say more because I didn't mean that literally. He's spinning in his lay right now. I didn't mean that literally. Okay. I mean he would let's go back to the hospital. He wouldn't want to work by himself. It's what I meant this thing. I think when Neil's by himself even gets more crazy. Yeah. Because I remember him when he used to just go. Not sure. Did you hear yesterday 9 to 10? Oh, he was great. What not incredible? Oh, it was just the only open. It was. It was. It was just it was absolutely was the only. Yeah. I think this last temptation to cry things really get him crazy. Right. Maybe a little bit. Oh, you have a story on it. I didn't know you all don't take requests. Right. Could it have been any longer? Yeah. Okay. While he played a couple of jingles. Yeah. I think I want to do one of the jingles. I'm doing this one too. It's like, why do you start today? You're dreaming. You're the singing time. It's 430 is swinging on the jump. Benz and Joe. Haha.

You know, the word from the bird, we're calling this what's happening with the cap. Where is the cap, and anyway? Well, you know, on a day like today, kind of a muggy morning, you start thinking about what happened in the past on this day. Oh. And it was on this day in 1970 that Janice Joplin played what proved to be her final concert at Harvard University in Boston. I didn't know that. And she was found dead two months later from Odeen on that bad stuff. You mean it didn't happen like it did in the movie where she just collapsed on stage and I was like, well, the movie I saw about her life. She was like in a car chase scene at the end and all these terrorists were like, she had a... The Hollywood version of her death. I'll rap. I'll rap. I'll rap. I'll rap. I'll rap. I'll rap. I'll rap.

Well, a Hollywood woman arrested on charges of growing Miragewana plants in her backyard was acquitted after explaining to a judge that she used the pot as a treatment for severe glaucoma. See, this was an excuse we used to use in middle school. I can't see, officer.

She says the thought of going blind was more frightening than going to jail. Doctors also testified that musica had more than a dozen eye operations. And marijuana has proven to be a successful treatment. Broward Circuit Court Judge Mark Pull and agreed with the arguments in the nonjury trial. Lawyer said it is one of only three successful cases in which medical need has been used as a defense for smoking marijuana. So congratulations to Elvy who is feeling a lot better.
