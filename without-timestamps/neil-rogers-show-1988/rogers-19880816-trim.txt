She said her out and she and her false eyelashes. Yeah. That's right. not recommend pressing charges. Brenda Richie has been charged with vandalism, resisting arrest, disturbing the peace, and corpal abuse of a spouse because she had no cooperation from the one witnessed Lionel Richie. Richie did not attend that session with his wife as was expected, and the officer says he does not want to press charges against his wife. This is better than days of our lives, and it's real.

Elvis Presley fans are remembering their idol today. 11 years after the man called the King, a rock and roll died. Of course, we'll always remember that tragic episode when he rescued those people from that burning building. He paid for it with his life. Some 5,000 of them are expected of the Presley mansion and Memphis. Ceremonies began last night with a candlelight procession. The grounds at Graceland are lined with flower arrangement some shape like guitars. A high school buddy of Elvis claims ownership of a rare item. A highly coveted two song record that Presley made for his mom in 53, which led directly to his discovery. The record was a record that led legendary story. Well, Edwin S. Leak Jr. Not to be confused with his father Edwin S. Leak. Says the record was left at his grandmother's house in Memphis to 25 years ago. And says Elvis later told him just to hold on to him. Well, Elvis experts stole the little disc as perhaps the single most valuable record in record collecting. What did you say it was like? Monalisa. It's a record. The Mona Lisa of Records. The experts add that everything checks out his legit with Leak. It was as he now wants to know what his prize possession is worth and you were saying it's estimated at what point. A half million bucks. A half million bucks. I'm trying. Bet you go this up after now that people know it's around.
