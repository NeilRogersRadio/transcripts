The seven number 17 record on your boogie man. In 1980, the top record of the whole year. What we just heard a little bit of was, please don't go by K.C. now. This man has made some serious impact, right? Into this business? That's impressive. 1983, the number two record, Africa by Toto, which we're not gonna hear little bits and pieces of again. That's a good one, Joe. Yeah, that's the one. When I kill him in Jaro meets the... Serengeti. Serengeti at Serrahavo and Arlene's butt. They're coming as flying out of my rush more. It's a 740 on Zeta 4. We have a mobile collar in Brown County, hello. That one is a snail. Yes, sir. The one that's a surcai you're doing. Okay, Kirk. I can't believe I did for your voice sound. I know, it's amazing, isn't it? On the phone here, it's compared to the radio. What do you do to it? What do I do to it? We put it through a filter, like in a lucky strike? Make you sound a lot better. I know. You do know. That's why I'm on the radio. That's why I'm on the street corners with a megaphone. It wouldn't sound as good. I gotta tell you one thing. The way you criticize all these other radio stations is really ridiculous. I know it's terrible, isn't it, sir? They don't sit around and talk to you. You're all showing nothing but sitting around. Can I say this to you, Kirk? If that's the case, how come you're listening, babe? It was an accident. It was an accident. All of a sudden, I just... Oh my god. Did you hear that, brother? It was an accident. These things have happened. I know. Maybe you can get back in again, babe. Ha ha ha. Unbelievable. Do you believe that? Now, of course, the other stations do not talk about us, right? No, never. Like the Isle of Dung over there, they just... Appaplectic to try to get us into a shouting match, which we're not going to do. Or that Zany guy. And Zany guy who's obsessed with talking about this show and Greg and Donald, who used to do Neo Roger's theater in the morning at 855. Now, they don't talk about us. Not at all. Anyway, moving right along, let's go to a carol, another mobile caller. Hello. I'm winning Neo. How are you, Carol? One time, let's near Freight Time, Clawler. I had a call in on a daydeline. Greg, while you have quite an act to follow, Carol. Oh, I too. Um, tell me about the melting pot, which is the best night to go there. Which is the best night? Yep. Go on a night when it's not crowded, like maybe a Monday or Tuesday? There open seven nights. Every night. What night are you there? What night am I there? Well, I'm not there on any particular night. I mean, I go every now and then, but when you're least expected. That we might bump in here. You might as possible. I think your wit is wasted on the audience. In this town, yeah, you're right, Carol. I should all use about half of it. And even then, I think it might be wasted. Yeah, you're right. But I do my best. You know, I just kind of fumble along here. And like the guy said before, I rip all these other people. It's ridiculous. And we don't have any show and all of that stuff, right? You've got a great step. I know. Enjoy it. Listen to what every morning going to work. Thank you, Carol. You have great taste. Have a nice day. Carol. Okay. Carol, she just kind of disappeared off into oblivion there. And she, these mobile callers, man, they've got a sense of humor in this morning that is unparalleled in the history of broadcasting. 742 on Zeta 4. I just can't believe that we accidentally, uh, well, on it. What was his name? These things happen. Why she put pick was that his name that we just, just hit bump with my arm. The thing over there. Well, don't worry about that. This is amazing because I didn't know my arms were that long to reach over there. My elbow. Okay, let's take a call from Miami next to sought to be exciting. Hello. Yeah, Neil. This is exciting. How are you doing? Listen, and what it is is all the novel people are getting strangled down by the abnormal down here in Dave County. So it makes us temporarily insane where we don't see this if we are at act. Now wait a minute. Is this ed? This sounds like ed, doesn't it? What's not? Okay, you sound, just about as monotonous and boring as ed. Oh, thank you. Listen, Neil, I like that song. Dave don't go, whatever bike you see. Please don't go, yeah. Yeah, that's a good tune. I was wondering now. Don't do it now, wait a minute. I am not going to require a quick. Oh, you would have me sooner reserved for justice. But I see airport that's going over. The airport is going over. Well, go on and on Neil. On Monday or Tuesday, I woke up at 21.99. Oh, yeah, Glenn, what was that? A nightmare. What was going on there? I don't know, you're playing, um, um, you're playing Casey, you're playing, uh, yeah, we're playing up screw cuts at this hour of the morning for all you people who, uh, getting to work me, it's just up to, I don't know, I was just winking up in the overnight, you know, did you, you know, Glenn, at two when I said, wow, what is this? I don't know, I'll come and fix and he was back on again. Yeah, did you like it? Did you like that obscure music? Yeah, I was pretty good. Yeah. It was pretty good, but, uh, I don't know where you got the long time point, eh? You need to move it up wherever everybody's listening. No, no, you just want me to know. No, no, we like to hide it. Oh, really? Yeah, that's on purpose. Yeah, I've heard the show and I think it's in the right spot. Yeah. Listen, Neil, I was wondering since you, uh, we're talking about obscure music, I was wondering about this, uh, by Asia. Can you music by Asia? You like Asia? No. I like Australia myself. Great. Okay, well, I guess, uh, that wasn't a request now, was it? Oh, no, I was just wondering if you could watch them. No, I don't, I'm not into that. Oh, I mean, because, uh, you talked about classic kids. I like Africa by Toto. Oh, come on. When Mount Kilimanjaro hits us connected in the eye, I like them. Yeah, well, I mean, you got tricky, uh, lyrics, you know, makes a great song all the time. Yeah. Asia did lots of it and, uh, Toto ever thought of doing. Well, what was Asia's big hit? Uh, the, uh, after first album, they got, uh, 11 out of 12 hits. One of the biggest hits was, uh, heated the moment. Okay, let me look it up for you. Now, Asia heated the moment reached number four. Mm-hmm. Only time will tell reach 17. Don't cry reach number 10. And the smile has left your eyes reach number 34. Those are the only four that they had. Now, who's the other group you're talking about Toto? Yeah. For you talking about Toto. I don't like Toto, by the way. So don't get the wrong idea. I think Toto sucks, all right? I was just mention that in passing. Well, in Toto, um, I think they are Toto-desancted. Okay. Now, they had Africa which reached number one by the way. So I think you're in trouble already. Rosanna, which was number two for five weeks and was 18 weeks in a chart, hold the line which reached number five, 14 weeks on a chart. That was the first hit. 99, make believe. And I won't hold your back reach number 10. So I'm afraid I hate to break the bad news to you about that. But don't, don't, listen, don't feel bad about it. Okay, because even Tab Hunter had a big hit. So, well, the American public don't overestimate their taste. It happens. And, uh, when you're going to have both your interviews. Yeah. What are you going to do now? What are we going to have you on for interviews about? Yeah. You know, you're going to have to embarrass yourself. People from Cooper City, like they have, uh, both your hands. For what? You know, so the audience can rag on them or ask them any questions that they want to have. I'm not going about it. Okay, that's a good idea. We'll bring them in here one of these days. If he's agreeable to it, see, I ordinarily don't like those asked the program director things because they're corny and they're just the stupid. Well, I have 100 dozen. Well, yeah. Yeah. Yeah, maybe if we ever get a 10 year old program directly like why 100 he would do it. I love those commercials. Hey, we call and we ask you what you want to do. Oh, no, no reason. I don't know. The reason I like the commercials is there are a couple of people in the spots who are really interesting, but you only see them very briefly. Yeah. You know what I mean? Okay, listen, have a great day. I'm sure it has. It's been good for you. I'll see you in Asia. All right. Thank you. Okay. We got some Asia. I can say, Barrier, we don't play Asia on this station. Do we? We've got three cuts, but we don't play him, do we? We do. I don't know the past few weeks, but months ago. Uh-huh. Are they right next to the David Lee Rothcuts? Which reminds me by the way, this Sunday is a very big day in town. You are aware that aren't you? Wow. At the Hollywood snortatorium? Chee. Oh. All those pre-pubes and more on kids are going to be out there watching this jackass jump around like some kind like he's got St. Vitis dance. Chee. That's a good description. I messed up like he just came from a drag show with the copa. I mean, he is really. What is with these kids today? Anywhere. Are they really that dumb? Do they think they sky can sing? He is. He's like a walk in tragedy, even the BGs never saw tragedy like him. Oh, Chee. Speaking of the BGs by the way, and I know that gets, that gets somebody really upset. I don't want them to go to this forgo's name again, but can I look up the BGs? I'd say it's so much fun. Because we know that they're one of those obscure groups and they certainly are not part of the history, the anales of Rock and Roll. Are they? No. They're more like, that's probably why we don't play baby come back by player, even though it was the number one record of 1978 because they're more gloves 94 a certain. They do play them on gloves, I mean, they do. Do they really do? Yes, they do. Good for them. Who am I looking up? That is probably the reason you're probably right. Oh, the BGs. Well, let's see. How can you mend a broken heart was only number one for four weeks? We can't play that. I started a joke. It was number six. I got to get a message to you. It was number eight. I've got to get a message to you. That's a A.O.R. type of cut. Kind of. Yeah. Massachusetts, which is, oh my god, look at all of these. Oh my god. So, what is it? Strategy was number one for two weeks. Love you when I was number one. Too much heaven was number one. Knight, fever was number one for eight weeks. Staying alive was number one. How deep is your love was number one? You should be dancing was number one. Jive talking was number one. They had three, six, seven, eight, nine. Number one hits. So, right reached number three. That was a good song. He's a liar. The woman in you run to me my world. First of May. Words. We're about the coal mine. Oh, here. Yeah. The lights went out in Massachusetts. Reach number 11. Holiday was 16. Massachusetts is another cut we could be playing. See, I don't want to say he gets upset when I do this because it makes it sound like I'm trying to program the station. But it just seems to me. Just as an observer in the passing musical scene with my lousy taste and music. There's a lot of stuff out there that just doesn't get played. When's the last time you heard anybody play Massachusetts by the BG's? No. Or I started a joke. Should be magic. Should play those. I assume they do. Especially with Dacacus in town. I'm sure he'd appreciate that. Oh, yeah. And it's just amazing how this all fits together. We've got to stir about Kitty Ducacus. Well, sorta. A man who spent nearly four years on the lamb with two, three and a half ton elephants says he will surrender if he is assured that the pack of terms aren't returned to a man he alleges brutalized them. Ireland's side end of 58-year-old animal trainer, who lives in New Jersey, hasn't seen his four children or met his only grandson since he took off in a tractor trailer with Tory and Duchess, two Indian elephants he raised from impency and then sold. The elephant's owner, Edward Drake and his father Richard and the president of a national animal trainer's group denied that the animals were abused. You're not animal stories. What you like this one. Now this is a little chart out of today's USA today. What are the categories? Jabberty has used most frequently since it's returned to TV in September 84. Now what do you think, history? You say history. That's not right. You want to guess? What category is it in? Presidents is also a good guess. No business in industry. 81 percent of the time they use business in industry and sports is number two, by the way, surprisingly 78 percent. On a new one, it becomes a contestant. Actually, you'd be often about 30 cents. Next is science. 68 percent religion is 65 percent and animals. 64 percent. Eric Buren. How's it in rising sun? Monterey. That's to be in the form of a question. That's right. What is Monterey? That is Monterey. A city right next to Carmelle. Who is, what's his name? Already. I'm not just eight the peas that were on top. You can have the pasta. I mean the pasta is good and all, but I figured I'd save you some. What a guy. Yeah. What a nice guy. What a great gesture. What a magnanimous guy. That's what I'm big. Anyway, so it's Rick's birthday coming up on Monday, huh? Rick and Marlene. Oh yeah. No, it's just Rick's birthday. Yeah. Well, let's see. Big Dave can go with me on maybe you can tag along too. You're invited. Thank you. On Monday at the Maldi. We'll see. Yeah, we'll see. I love that. And let's see. And you and the big Dave can fight over who's going to have Marlene be their date. And 29 past nine on Zeta 4 and they probably won't show up anyway because they're so nervous. They just, these people get all nervous about this. They don't understand. It's just a radio show, okay? I could have abscond with anybody or drag anybody off kicking and screaming. No. No, I like them to come with me quietly. I'll keep this game. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? Great. I want to screw with that guy with a hat to get who it's the hat. What's going to start up in games though. Oh yeah. I went through his house. Do you know that this guy's married to a former playboy buddy? Really? Oh yeah. Absolutely. He's incredibly hot. It's amazing. You mean, senior is married to a former buddy? Absolutely. Maybe that's why he talks like he has seen vitus dance all the time. Maybe that's it. Hmm. Anyway, the house is amazing. And so it's deep, but he's pretty nasty. Is he really? Yeah. That matter real nice guys. They get a lot. I am not a lot of people. Yeah. But anyway. Yeah. A lot of people, most of the people who used to work for him or with him have got very unkind things to say about him. Yeah. That's probably very true. But listen, you're pretty famous. The world round, I'm sure. I went to the restaurant out in the town and country mall in Kendall. Yeah. The food is terrible. The place was bad. I mean, I took this amount and I have to get a table. Hmm. But everybody they were talking about you. The waiter was talking about you. Are you cereal? What were they saying? Well, they were saying just well, right for it, they talked about the steve mix that which is the right, by the way. But I heard this guy with a neck-to-tailed horror. They can then always just like, really? He's like, incredible. Wow. Yeah. And we were talking about you too, son. I mean, maybe we were the steve that was running through the whole place. Yeah, maybe the Neil Rogers disease was spreading throughout the town and country. Yeah, I get something that's got a spread through that place. Yeah. It was pretty well. Great. But anyway, I would to get back to your multiple soup and angel hair pasta. OK. Just as long as I don't get any angel hair in my multiple soup, right? That would be a bad idea. OK. See you later. Thanks. I 31 on Zeta 4, Gonserby, a log of 10 past 10 with the 16 in a row, 8 billion hits and all kinds of good stuff. Gonser is grilled today, by the way, features. Yeah, yellow. Where are you looking now? Yellow, the kinks have led Zeppelin. Well, there's nothing wrong with that. What's going on in that show anyway? Hmm. Why is this good? Oh, you're not ready. Sorry. What do you mean I'm not ready? I'm ready. Whatever you are, OK? Number six is something about radio. No, it's not because number six is flashing. OK. I guess. Try something about radio. You're right. West Kendall. Where's that? On one is West Kendall. Hello. Question is, you need somebody to take care of my lean weight. You're saying care for brother? We have a volunteer, huh? I think I could handle that. I bet you could. Monday night is a melting pot. Yes. You're going to combine say hi? Yeah. I'm going to combine say hi. But from our lean. I bet you will. Well, we'll probably have a pretty busy if the burden the big day. Come by to probably have a very well occupied. And just for all memories, sake. And I'll let me just set the, uh, I've been making your phone ringing my phone. I can take time. I can get the phone. Oh, this is good. Is that all we're going to get to hear? Do I can hear the whole thing? Oh, yeah. Come on. Let it go. You're it is. We're eating anyway. Yeah, this kills a lot of good time. Reggin, uh, Rick. I'm Ricky Tiggie. I like this. I like this. I like this. I like playing games. Uh, I can make your phone ringing my phone. Where you can take that. I can take that. I can take that. I can take that. Yeah. Well, I'm really screwed up. And then I'm going to break this. I'm going to break this. I'm going to play games here. I'm sure. You're following me. Okay. Well, first one. Okay. Well, first one. Ah, ah, ah. Let's go with it. Are we doing it, General? Yeah. Okay. All right. I mean, there's no discussion of the, uh, Ah, ah, ah. The way things will be bent of, uh, uh, social problems or anything else. It's just shocking radio. I am 34 on Zeta 4. That Rick. He never lets us down, does he? What a sense of humor. He's always right there when you need him. Ah, ah, ah. Anyway, moving right along. Let's see. Let's see. Why don't you just tell me. Okay. Okay. Okay. But North Cuba. They'd County. Hello. Point is this. Um, tell me if you're there. You're talking about the ratings. How much did you beat JTR by? Let's see. We had a full one and they had a three one. That's 12 plus and in 25 to 54, we had a five six and a and a four two. Yeah. We destroyed him. We wiped him out. They weren't second and we're even close to being second and we'll have a bunch of stations in between. Are you talking, you know, like, while 100, you're talking to stations that don't do a listen to like, what's that? You, you like, you, whatever you're talking about. No, no, no, I'm talking about stations like why 100 and Waxi and um, love 94. They're way down the line. Oh, yeah. JTR is on a flat spin man. They're dropping like an atomic bomb over Hiroshima. I'm telling you. You think the reason is because the energy is really, you know, other than yourself, they're the only ones that have any to me and he builds the at all. But they don't do anything. They're never on. All he do is got a jukebox over there. I don't think they're funny to begin with to be honest with you. Come to this video. Well, what's it a great while, but I mean, who wants to listen for four hours and you know, hoping on a wing and a prayer that today we might hear something entertaining. Yeah. But they're, they're just not on. I got a jukebox. You know, and they have that stupid promo that says, our hermenemic being and music in the morning, what a novel concept, which is basically like saying, you know, they're hanging around here, but we're playing a ton of music. The reason they're saying that basically, because they're, you know, the sound, since you've come on and turned to talk basically, yeah, Joey Reynolds and. Well, yeah, see, but Joey, of course, is going to be out of their soon. Unfortunately, we like him to stay forever, but that just can't go on forever. And she is playing more music. They're making Joey play more music. You got to bring back Jimmy and Steve. Who? Jimmy and Steve, I mean, get, you have a death wish for them all together, don't you? Guys are bad. Yeah. They're not, they're not as zany as Joey is. Yeah. The how far, how do you, everybody else, where are you? In one. Number. What is the closest person to you? In one. In 25 to 50. We tied with sunny. Had a five six. We were number two in the market. CMQ FM, the Spanish language beat us, but in English speaking, we were tied for first with sunny with a five six. And then there was a lot of people right behind like I think I don't have it in in front of me, but I think Waxi had about a five five and gloves had a four seven and GTR had a four two and. And. And they said, The GTR is beginning to hurt and she is dead in water and were slowly but surely making some in roads, you know. I was just curious. Okay. See you later. Bye. Bye. I'm 37 on Zeta 4. Montes-Balsup is great. The angel hair pasta bull on ease was phenomenal from that street road to Surrey. And the Fedachini Alfredo is excellent. Yeah. I noticed you've cleaned that pretty much. You look the plate. You're getting close to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. See, you can eat it faster and get more nutrition at the same time. Right. Montes was good. Hmm. Now of course comes that moment that you've all been waiting for. Seriously. Wow. As Uncle Neil dips into the. Amoretto. Buckleva. Buckleva. Hmm. See that's where I draw the line. A buckleva. Hmm. You're nuts. Hmm. Remember how you didn't know what homotation was captain. Hmm. Well, if you don't know what Buckleva is. Well, make you feel real Greek. Yeah. That rock group from Canada isn't Buckleva. Turn it over, drive. Me, me. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Oh. More. Is it just got stuck? What do you, what? What do you, what? What do you, what? You've got to have a look on it. You've got to have a look on it. He's not. He's just into the food. Don't let him kid you. What's going on in this room? He can pack it away. Oh. You are just going to freak out when you taste this. It is so good. Amoretto. Buckleva. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. He's forever. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. What is he? Just going to sit there now while I'm eating. Hmm. Hmm. What do you want me to do? He wants the show to start back up. So another is basically you have for no act life, right? Great idea. Hmm. Hmm. Twenty-two till ten on Zeta Four is the food. The food madness continues. I don't look at him in there. He's like, he's like oblivious. Yeah, no. He polished off. What is that now? Fettuccine. He's eating with a spoon too. He polished it off so fast. Like most people would eat a thing of yogurt. He had a pound of Fettuccine Alfredo. I'm serious. Yeah, but it's healthy calories. I bet you eat one of those big stoffers, lasagna's frozen. You don't even take the time to cook it, do you? Are you kidding? I don't need stuff like that. Oh, sorry. I cook it first. No, I don't need frozen food. Hmm. Here he goes, you know, when I talk. At this very minute, my mother is making monocot be for me when I arrive at the city. He's really in Milton. Oh, in Pensacola? Well, it's outside Pensacola. Milton. The best monocot that you've ever tasted in your life. Great. Now is that greater what? Okay, get it. I don't know. I'm going to take it home. What I'm going to do. Then we have these incredible cookies. I know the captain. They won't touch this because he doesn't eat sugar. No. Seriously, he doesn't eat sugar. I'm just going to break off a piece of one. Did you say something about brownies before? Hmm. Captain Mong? He's in a coma. I'm sorry. Ladies and gentlemen, please send your donations to the... Resurrect Captain Dave Fund. RDC. Hmm. Hmm. Yeah. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. Hmm. We should have guests the food contest. And we get all these big ratings. It's just unbelievable. It's really makeshift wonder. We do, huh? I, it's true. Yeah. Yeah. See you again. We, underlined in red. Hmm. Yeah. Well, I can't say absolutely not exactly. Twenty-before-ten on Zeta 4. And let's take some more calls. Because the lines continue flashing here. They don't give a damn. We sound like pigs on a year. Broward. Hello. Yeah. How are you? How are you? I'm Howard. I thought you ran as a week of from Michigan. You were the loser. Oh, yeah. Howard for Michigan. How are you doing? Good. I can't see all this stuff this early in the morning. What were you get up in 4 and 30 by 9 o'clock? You ready for launch, babe? I thought I got a good joke for you. Uh, is this a rail-tell joke? Hmm. But this is a good one. But is it dirty? Oh. We sure. Is it in bad taste? I don't use all the time anyway. Like what? Well, the cellar walked into the park. No. Oh, yeah. We don't do jokes. How are you? Can I ask you a question? You're a whole show that you're... How are you? What? He's getting tested now. How come you won't talk to me, Howard? He's getting here this one. How come you won't answer anything? We don't let him tell the joke. He's not going to like us anymore. You don't respond to anything. You don't even have to be correct. I got to like you. I'm not from Detroit. I just live there for two years. Don't keep saying I'm from Detroit. I'm from Rochester, okay? Well, they didn't. That's, I guess, assume I was out of Detroit. I'm from a civilized city. I'm not not Rochester, Michigan. Rochester, New York. Oh, Rochester, New York. But that's worse, huh? No, it's not worse. It's a great town. If it ever stops knowing everybody won't live there. Yeah. We don't do jokes, Howard. You don't do jokes. You don't do requests. You just eat. No, we do a show here. We do the show. We don't want the audience to do in jokes. But when you hear this, when you might use it. Oh, my God. What does it take to convince this man from Detroit that we don't do jokes? Everyone that starts to do it. Everyone I'm running to the board. I turned off the lights. Let me ask you something. Once the last time he ever heard somebody call in Dick Pertn and do a joke on here. Okay. And well, he's just Dick Pertn. He had so many jokes you don't have to. Remember he used to do the coughing deal from the mayor? Hmm. Remember Ham Tramik Mama? Ham Tramik Mama. Remember him often Dick Pertn? Yeah. He was the funniest. So how are you? Yes. How are we having to call that in many years? Well, it fits. How are we? Somehow it fits. You know, I'm from Lakeland. You know who does bring trains there? Sure. Yeah. So have you ever been to... Have you ever been to... Have you ever been to where they train? And I could have went anyways. Yeah, have you ever been to Benny's Oyster Bar up there? Oh. How about steak and shake? Bacon shake? Bacon shake? Yeah. I've never heard of the steak and shake. Uh huh. Haven't? Trying to get around my joke, aren't you? Now what gives you that idea? Well, I don't know. Now tell us about meeting that guy you met from radio. The guy? Oh, that's right. Yeah, I have to be at town. At town. I do pull works. All you were the pull guy. Well, not the pull guy. We do pull restoration. Hmm. And he told me he just moved down here and moved into plantation. And he knows you. Yeah, sure we know him. I don't know if station he did a P.R. Who? Johnny Dark. Oh yeah. Yeah, maybe this one you never know. I doubt that. Yeah, you never know. Obviously he's not on the radio yet because he can't afford to get his pull fixed. That's right. He just moved down. Yeah. But there's girlfriend. Hmm. I still don't understand. How does somebody move down and move in without having a job? I don't know. That's what I asked him. He'll get a job. He said don't worry about it. I'll get a job. I did the same thing. Here are the silhouettes and get a job on Zeta Floor. I did the same thing. I moved to this town without a job. Really? Has the most people do? I think it's not that uncommon. You know? You came to town. Oh, you went to Palm Beach. So you came to Miami. You had a job. Pony on you. Me? Yeah. Pretty on orthodox. Oh, is it really? More than the land funding went to Detroit.

I could take her to the deal. Take her out for a little, uh, little birthday treat to chicken payles. Just do chicken restaurant and Carol City up here right up the street. You know, something she tried out a burrino stator or ani, but she didn't get the part last night. Right. That's exciting, how are you? I like to dance on your show, but all you're on in see her.

They're probably trying to put two and two together. Yeah. Trying. I think it's the uh... I understand that the Lou Gordon show's going to make it come back. Lou's going to do it from heaven.

My name is B. Life D. Okay. It's 12 minutes before 10. I thought that would fit in. Wouldn't you? Well, so in other words, if anyone wants to call and reminisce about Michigan, this is the show. This is the, uh, I'm sure going to show. Yeah, great. I must say that I like the Detroit colors, but that one I got a little lost. Howie confused. That was frustrated. Performed on 10 to stand and runs in the faint. It's family. Mm-hmm. Okay. Let's get another call on from plantation before we have to do our thing here. Hello. Hi, Neil. Hi. I just wanted to make this real short and sweet. Okay. Breathe about you. I don't know what I do. If I didn't have to show to listen to in the morning. Yeah. Take it easy on those heavy foods. Okay. I just, uh, killing me with kindness. You're going to just pouring the food down my throat. Uh, you can keep the milk close for the food. So you can get the funny stuff coming out. Okay. I got to go teach you my son. Yeah. But thanks for answering my call. Okay. Bye-bye. Wow. As a matter of fact, since I have been eating all of this food, I have had some funny stuff coming out. Oh, I am. Well, we certainly don't want to discuss that. The big question I'm going to report is that the Grammys class I was, would Michael Jackson join the winners and speaking with reporters backstage. Well, the question became moved when he lost all four awards he was up for. But the night wasn't a total loss for Mickey. He got a standing ovation after performed his latest single, Man in the Mirror. First lady, Nancy Reagan says doctors should watch what they say when commenting in public on the health of presidents and their families. In an ABC interview to be broadcast to our night, Mrs. Reagan said she recalls watching TV with her husband, while he was in the hospital. When the doctor came on the sentence, he'd give the president four or five months to live. Yeah. You know, the Nancy said that her husband was the most important president in the Mirror. Oh, my God. Everybody should know. Yeah. Well, we want to wish Happy Birthday today to James Do and he is Scotty on Star Trek. He's 68 today. Also Ed Marinero, who was on Hill Street Blues. It's this birthday. That's correct. He played for Cornell by them. That's what's right. There's a play for Cornell. Now, it was on this state in history 10 years ago today that the remains of comedian Charlie Chaplin were stolen by extortionists from his grave in Switzerland. No, it was Michael Jackson. Oh, yeah, that's right. And five years ago today in LA, President Reagan challenged the TV network's The Dwell on Good News for National Volunteer Week. And by the way, the network's declined. You don't realize it, but Ricky Schroeder has president Kennedy's brain. Did you know that? That's true. It's true. Okay. Anything else going on today? I think that's it. I think we've done it all. Partly cloudy. It'll be about 80 today and 68 tonight. And it's 72 now on J4 at 9.51. 9.54 on Zeta 4. Now let's put our Zeta 4 microphone into the control room for just a moment or two. And see how Captain Dave is coping with two days in a row of this gluttony. Okay. I'm going to write a law. We'll be right a law. Oh, God. I just, I don't know how he's keeping it up, man. It just never stops. It never stops. It goes on and on and on. What is this? I don't know. CBS. It's tough explanatory. What is this? Passes? Oh, for the deraille. Anybody want to go to golf tournament. Anybody want these? Oh, bunch of passes. It's a weak kick and a deraille. This is the big weekend, right? Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Right. Oh. Hello. Well, Neil. Yes, sir. Okay. Yesterday's Harold in the movie section. A night in the life of Jimmy Reardon. Two and a half stars. Yeah. Due to the performant, these stars, Magnetic Personality. Really? Mm-hmm. What's that? You got to be putting me on. I couldn't have been built, Crossford. I don't think we've covered. No, I don't think we've covered. I'll crossford, but I've given it four stars. I probably would be there. But according to the review, he looks pretty good at the movie, other than that. I got news from his face. He doesn't look good in, well, if he looks good in the movie, then he must have put a lot of makeup on because he's an ugly kid. I'm sorry. I hate to burst your bubble. But, you know, he just, well, that's in different strokes for different folks. You know what I mean? Why such a big change from stand by me? I don't know because he just, you know, as people get older, they change and sometimes they change for the better and sometimes as they do in Germany, they take a turn for the worst. You don't like him because he grew up. You know, like, because he's ugly. I'm not really all that excited about 12 year old kids. You know what I mean? When he was in stand by me was what 12 or 13 years old. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And he looked like he had promised. Like he was going to blossom out and be a vera, strapping, wonderful young man, and all of that other. He's ugly. Anyway, yeah. I found it. Are you upset over the fact that I think he's ugly? I'm just moving on to another subject. Okay, because I mean, my friend who came to the to shells that night, a week or so, a go brought me this big folder and one half, there are all these pictures of vera Phoenix and on the other half, there were these incredible pictures about a dozen of them. Pat Peterson. Okay. Now, do you think that I pondered for a long time, which ones I would treasure and keep in cherished and fondle? Tough question. No, I was not a tough question for me. It was very easy. Moving along. Yes. Okay. I found a actress with a name that's even better than river Phoenix's. Okay. Last night watching HBO, I caught the tail end of a movie called One Spin. Yeah. And in the cast, credits was an actress named Rainbow Shalom. Oh, I like that. She's very big and on the beach. I think that's river's sister. That sounds like a sherbet flavor you'd find in Israel, doesn't it? Well, I get to my vote over River Phoenix. Okay, mine too. Thanks a lot. Okay. See you later. I'm 58 on Zeta 4. And we move rental on. That really reflects the way I feel. The amazing. The BG2, the Miami Beach 4D hot air and the Palm Beach is good. Morning. It's the Neil Rogers Show. I'm Sator 4. Are you trying to say that this culinary, this disgusting display is finally catching up to you? Yeah. Yeah. Oh, that was good. That was one of each channel. Okay. Let's go back to the guide. We'll talk about synchronicity. Everybody better call the police. Speaking of Sator 4. Let's take a call from Miami. Hello. Hi Neil. How are you today? Good. Have a question for me. Okay. You used to be up in Connecticut, weren't you? No, I've never worked in Connecticut. Or anywhere near there. The greener? No. Okay. Next question. Yeah. Why do you hate women so bad? I don't hate women at all. What? But you're always making fun, complaining, calling off winers. No, I'm not. We got a lot of male winers, too. I mean, I mean, this is a good try for whatever point you're trying to make. Of course I don't hate women. Why would I hate women? Well, I don't know. I'm asking you that. Well, I don't. Everybody's taking on an individual basis. Yeah. People are people. Okay. Whether they're male or female or somewhere in between. I mean, you know, people are whatever they are. We had all this women. Okay. No matter fact, when we had all the young women call on the show yesterday, I said it was great. It was refreshing. I thought it was very nice to them. Okay. Well, why do you, what are you chuckling about? Why is that so amusing to you? It just is. Well, is there a specific incident you want to discuss? I just think overall in general. I think overall in general was. Oh, so in other words, no matter what I say, every time I turn it on, you're, oh, God, you're. No, it's just certain ones like you. Okay. She's not just certain ones like her that I despise. Well, she's got to just try to make a point. I mean, I don't know where it's because I'm not, I don't sexually lust after her body. Therefore, I can't possibly like women. Mm-hmm. What a smart ass. Oh, she's like glad and I are here four hours with you. Four and a half hours with you every day. And I have never heard you say anything deprecating toward women. No, I don't, I don't like women or dislike women. I like or dislike people as individuals based on the way they are. I don't give a damn what they are. I don't have it. She's just a bitch. That's all. You really is. Anyway, it's not going to bother me because we had a great meal. Ten o'clock on Zeta 4 and let's go to a oral geobals next. Hello. Any other going? Pretty good. No. Adam. Adam, how are you doing, Adam? You know what you want? I'm at the second, I'm the first Adam. The Adam who, uh, the body builder. The above there. Yeah, the one who's brother is a pain in the grass. Right. You're brother is really sick, you know that? What do you do? You don't know? No. Yeah, your brother called up Stan a few weeks ago and was ragging on me and on the show. In the beginning of the call, what is his name? Tony. Tony. And the beginning of the call he was Tony. And by the end of the call he was you. He had convinced himself that he was you and he had been on my show and I'm a douchebag and all of that. I mean, Tony's got some problems. Oh, yeah. He always pulled me. He made, I mean, he formed Stan. He made Stan think that he owned some hotel over the Bahamas. That was believing it. Really? Yeah, he recorded that call. Yeah, well, Tony, I think it looks like kind of an fantasy land, doesn't he? Well, yeah, he's got a little kind of a macho problem there too. Sorry, the Vieldi Bisc. Believe her, now he's go for the scum on their foot. Oh, yeah, she's. She says, Jim, she says on how. In other words, he's whipped, so to speak, right? Yeah, listen, I saw an ad in the Sunday's Miami Herald and classified. Yeah. Or babysitters for girls only. But the number was 624, 9400 between the hours of 2 and 6. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No, that's put on obviously. Must be from the same people in Kendall who put the other stuff in the high school results in the sports section. Must be. Well, has Gwyn got in the light field, or is he still just hanging out? He's still floundering, you know. Now you're talking to me. You're saying to me, have I found the life yet? Yeah. And now your brother calls up in the biggest event in his life. And he's still talking about it to this day is that you were on Neil Show one day. Oh, yeah. And he thinks it was him, yeah. And he thinks it was him. He convinced himself it was him. And you're talking about me not having a life man. Oh, I don't think you're getting a little early with me because he didn't like me that day. You're kind of. Yeah. Glenn doesn't like any of the people who are coming on the show. He's very paranoid about them in defense of in hospital. What did you expect me to do Adam? Oh, be a little friendlier. You and he's smiling. Yeah. I was like the day that Jim Scholar came in from Hot 105. He was so sterly to him and turned his back on him and treated him like a mung brain. Yeah. Exactly the same. You know, it was exactly the same. Yeah. And we all know that that's the way it happens. There you go. Yeah. The world is new. What's that? What else is new? That's about it. Adam, we're just to hang in loose here. You know what I'm saying? What are you going to have like a little reunion and have everybody that's been there back on the show? That's a good idea. The only problem is like some of those people abandoned us, I think. Do you remember those kids from, was it Miami Springs? Yeah. That kid Eric who sent us that picture. All the kids in the shower. And John, it was a kid named Johnny Wad. What was a kid's name? The Wad. Yeah. They kind of, we hear what's in a great while. But I think those people have flipped out. Well, you don't have like a, I'm just getting, well, I'm already skipping school that they have just kicking back. But you know, you go to school and then you can't wait on the phone. Now, wait a minute. What does that mean? Adam, you're not skipping. You're just kicking back. That's an interesting way of putting it, isn't it? You're just going to go to school. And then I kind of lay out in the couch, but I'm giving you. And you start listening to this show. All right. And then I call him and I said, well, I'm going to go to the phone. I'm going to go to the phone. I'm going to go to the phone. I'm going to go to the phone. Really? Tough night, hi Adam. Uh, so, so. Yeah. You have to do your things when you're, well, why you still can't? Yeah, that's for damn sure. Anyway, moving right along. So listen, give Tony a big hug in a kiss for me. Okay. You want me to walk a bit with him? And now don't go that far. That's that's disgusting. And anyway, we, that's a good idea. Well, let's, you know, ahead of time, we're going to do that reunion thing. We'll have all the people in here, including that kid that remember that kid, the lifeguard that Glenn really got upset. Okay, yeah. Oh, he was, he just decimated that poor guy. I think I was just as harmless as a butterfly, and he just destroyed him. So we'll have all these, all you guys back. I think little than two of the baby. Oh, yeah, right. Yeah. He's just, distance. Yeah, he's all, in fact, he was intimidated by big Dave. In fact, every time big Dave comes on his show, he's still intimidated. I believe it. Yeah, I'll go. Listen to that. I'm having a great life. Okay. And it's good hearing from you. Bye bye. Now, are we going to start getting defensive and surly? I just wondered if we had time today to go through that Jim Scholar incident again. I think we need to go through it, step by step. Since you brought it up again. I didn't think we should go through it again. No, I don't think so. I think it's boring and monotonous. And we, those of us who were a party to it, we know the real story. No, I want, I want to. I want to know what's really happened. He's just a nice guy. He's not going to, uh, brag on you. No, I want, well, we don't have to do it today, but I would like to go through it again. Now, what was that thing in the classifieds in a Harold again about baby sitter from two to six for girl, though, Lee. I've got some shun on W.I.N.C. Okay, that's just a little musical hint. That's all you get. We're not playing anymore than crap, okay? Enough is enough. And then he was, Stan was on the other day all upset because I let these people, when I take my shots and him, he says it's only very short and sarcastic and to the point. And I was letting people go on a great length and ripping him. There are those occasions when he does four hours like the one he did two or three days ago that I heard about, but I did not hear. What the hell is going on here? Folks, I mean, it's only, we're just doing a radio show in here. What is that again? Is that an instant replay? There might be the Russians finally. Oh, yeah, look at that. There are 16 helmeted Russians coming down. Oh, no, that's the Santa Rhea house. There's a big sign there. It says chicken liken. Do you believe what's going on back here in this eight track room? Who the hell is in there? It's coming from the music director's room. It's in the music director's room. Are you serious? I think they can even hear that on here. It's a conal red. Oh, yeah. This is a test for the next 60 seconds. Anyway, what were we just discussing before we got distracted? Ripping. There is so much distraction going on here. Ripping. Oh, yeah. And he lets these people go, oh, yeah. Neal socks, that shows no good. He's not the same anymore. We're, yeah, we used to love him. He lets that go on. On in finitum, okay, forever and ever in the Glen Hills Drow in his sidekick. And hey, that's fine. You know, more power tool. He's got no listeners left anyways on a dead station. But if we have the audacity, let's some callers go in. You know, come on here and take some shots. He can't handle it. It's true. Shame on you, Uncle Stanley. Shame on you. So we are going to have a show with the topic. One of these days when Rose Folger comes in. Yeah. Why did you talk to him about it? No, just great idea. You're weird. We had a good idea. You're not talking about music. Something about like the primary or something. Before we go, we still have, now this was in Monno. Wasn't it? Prove the little kids? Yeah. You're not going to play that again, are you? Well, there is school in there. See, there are a lot of people who didn't hear the very beginning of the show to quarter to six. And when you come in and somebody has alleged material for you. And you put it in the machine assuming that it's something worthy of airplane. It comes out like this. This is Miss Karen and Miss James. Three and four year old players at the JCC in Fort Lodd, Zayal. Yeah. My name is I'm Dota. I'm a C-Pyron. C-E-O-H-M-N-S-S. I sure did. Captain Dave ate most of my home in town. Oh, you're the only way right now. Do not say bye. Bye. Hey, hey. Why doesn't she have stuff made up for her guy's show? Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Why do you think you can play this in the Hooters back to back? Uh-huh. Why is she worrying about this show? It's a nice gesture. But this is a U-M class, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Now this was an F-I-U. Kids at U-M don't come to class. They sit out. Hey, wait, wait. No, I'm fine. I tell you, this makes me feel like Mr. Greengean. I do not know. Hi. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hi. I have to find one more. Yeah. How is that? I want to thank you. Whoever that brilliant teacher was and all that. And of course, we don't want to leave without hearing the finale here from our dear friend. But the music can sound a lot. You know, when you took a finale. I was going in the background on some of the... Oh, for today it was. They went through a lot of parties in the 60s and 70s and in the 60s. I had a stereo that you couldn't tell if it was popcorn, popping, baking, frying, or the drum solo from an agarativeeda. Yeah. That's terrific. Well, that would have to be content. Man, I'm excited to be continued tomorrow. There's the first of 16 in a row. A Z-4 have a great day and a great life. And just remember our slogan on T-A-D-D. Don't call us. We'll call you.
