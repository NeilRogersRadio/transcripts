boy. This is Neil Roger. So, that is your brain. Any questions? Yeah, we got a lot of questions. You know, yesterday, to remember everybody was calling it, I got a couple of questions. Remember that question? I'm a second tired of that man. We'll ask the goddamn question, okay. Anyway, it's 10.05 at WIOD. Sound like Uncle Mike was having a real good time down there in the Bahamas. And I have a feeling that the good time is just beginning. I'm saying, I have a feeling he's going to really have a hot weekend. Anyway, we got four hours to kill here today. And then Steve has come along at the two night. You think Steve has a guest today? You know? I'm going to talk about it. I'll show you yesterday because that, I listened to a lot of it. Did you? No. Man, I am getting so ticked with these old farts, really. Something's got to be done. I mean, it's one thing to talk about it, but something has got to be done. And that Alan Becker, he's on my list now. I used to like him. I remember when he ran, what did he run for? He ran for a couple of things. It always lost. He ran for, oh, he ran against Larry Smith. Yeah. And the Democratic primary for Congress. Remember many years ago? Yeah. First time Larry ran. Wow. And, um, Bah, I'll tell you, thank God that he didn't win. Now that I look at it, in fact, I supported him then. I supported Alan Becker because I didn't know Larry too well back then. Oh, Steve's got open phones today. But it's great. So we're excited about that. But anyway, Alan is the con, one of the condo attorneys. And of course, a caller hit it right on the head. You know, these guys are ricking in the bucks. And that's what it's all about. It's not, it's not, you know, protecting the law. That's that's that's that there's so many laws that aren't enforced. And laws that should be off the books. And that one's going to be changed anyway. You know, the law about these adult only complexes. They do hear what they were doing in some of the condos because the laws going to change the spring. They were sending little forms around to everybody in the mail, telling them that when the question here comes to them. That they should put down the age of the oldest person who lives there in a condo. Because the law will require that in condos, when are over a certain percentage 80% or over 55, then they can keep young people out. So in other words, let's get the median age up to 100. And then we can keep all those horrendous young people under the age of, you know, 200 out of the building. That makes me want to puke. I'm sick and tired of that nauseated, revolted. And Henry is going on vacation. He just said for a week, and Sonny is going to Hawaii. What the hell is going on here? You think these people had been here a while or something, right? We've been here six weeks already. We're not going anywhere. All right. You know, I could do a whole show on Steve show yesterday. Yeah. But that would be wrong, right? Would it be wrong? Yeah, probably. Waste the time. No, would not be a waste of time. Any opportunity to rip the old farts is not a waste of time. Good point. Disgusting behavior. And this, you know, Steve brought up so many good points. And some of the other people did too, the idea that they can exclude young people. You can discriminate against people because of age, but not because of their race or their religion array. That's a lot of Mark. Yeah. That's making me sense. Well, here's the first trickle of mail. I remember yesterday there were like, there was like this. There was a little tiny trickle of mail. And I kept saying, OK, where's the real mail, OK? And then we got two cartons full of mail. I hope that doesn't happen again today because fat rich is not here. You may have to come in and help us open a mail. Hey, man. Is that a deal, sure? OK. Look at the yellow work picture here. So you'll be OK. Yeah, you can look at the Dina picture there. It'll make you feel like old times. Now, what is that? Is that another carton? Or is that the one at Rich Hat? What is that? What is that? You're doing it in. Oh, that's the food. Oh, they, oh, yeah, that's my chicken soup. That's in Delhi. By the way, brought the food by today. I think they're very much for that. And I was good. I looked at it downstairs. They brought stuff cabbage, which looked incredible. And all kinds of good stuff. But I'm sure Linda, a new persistent listening, and I'm fine. Went off the thing just a little bit again today. She went, bye, bye, bye, bye. We'll say go nuts, you know. So I'm not going to do that. I'm not going to do it a second day in a row. As Don Johnson would say, I'm definitely not going to do that. Oh, look at this. Somebody said, I don't understand this. There's a check in. There's cash and there's all kinds of house around here. But anyway, this is just the beginning of opening up the mail, right? Yeah. All right, let's give those numbers out. Because I'm sure we've got a lot of old parts that want to call in today and talk about how terrible it is to have children around. And then we'll do an hour where they can talk about how bad it is to have blacks around. And how bad it is to have Jews around. Because whatever other group that they want to discriminate against and keep out, because they're miserable and nasty and filthy and subhuman and disgusting. And some of the colors, even some of the younger colors, yes, today turned my stomach. Well, I can see both sides. If they want to have complexes where they have only certain buildings where people are allowed to have children, that would be fine. I believe that. And then you know, I lived in the, oh, sure. I've lived in the young building. But not to have a whole complex. And they talk about how kids make noise. I told you about my mother's complex where the guy upstairs. I call him the elephant man junior. Because this guy, cops and cops and cops and every time I go over to my mother's, you sit in there, try to talk or watch TV and you hear, pop, man. It sounds like the guy is going crazy. If they're like he's dropping typewriters on a floor. I know. Like he's dropping his fax machine on the floor. Anyway, it's 10, 10 at WIOD. We'll come back in just a second. I don't want, maybe we'll do a whole show on that because I'm so agitated. Historical, apoplectic. You? Me. Well, you know that's unusual for me. It's awesome. Get yourself a boy. I hate you. And you're a 10 or 14. Who's on vacation? Tanner, yeah. I wonder if we haven't gotten this $5000 check it for Camila's house, but I'm sure it's on the way. Okay, it's 10 or 14 at WIOD. And you know, like I said, I could scream and get hysterical. It isn't going to do any good. You're right. Because those people are going to change. The one good thing is a lot of them are going to die. Hopefully, very soon. Very soon, like by the end of the show, maybe. Okay. And I'll be happy to help plant them in the ground. ground. And then we can bring some living and breathing people under the age of maybe like 98 people who aren't on the Willard Scott's weather on NBC. Those are the people who should be eligible to move to Florida. We got enough old people already, okay? So right to all your grandparents and your great grandparents tell them to stay to hell where they are. All right, don't bring them down here. Man, I can't stand it. See what a lot of people do up north. A lot of these middle-aged people, yuppies and younger people, they pack up their parents and grandparents to get in the hell out of the way. And they ship them down here. I know. Like in crates, you know, they just ship them here. And then of course the first thing they do, just like illegal aliens, they go out and they buy a big car, they go out and buy a battleship, they've never driven, they used to use the subway and a bus and taxis all their life and they come down here and they buy a battleship. See, I used to think that was a law. You talk about law. Yeah, when they come here, oh, it is a law. They, when they come here, it's got to be a continental or a Cadillac. It's got to be one of those two. Okay, we got a mobile on five here. Hello. Yeah, Uncle Nail. Yes, sir. How are you doing? Okay. I'll be all they're doing. Great. Okay. To wrap up, horror story to tell you. It sounded like young brother. I'm, I am. Don't panic now, sir. I know you're a little nervous, but never the way. I'm in traffic right now. Friend of mine is clothing salesman and the store that he works for had nine boxes of brand new clothing. He packaged them up. I went down yesterday to pick them up, taken to Kanoa, South. Yeah. And I asked the owner of the store. You know, where's the clothing house? First pick up. Oh, well, we threw them out. Why did you, why did you, you know, why did you trash them? Well, you know, us giving that clothing to the home was just encouraging it. Oh, that's great. Yeah. That's like saying feeding starving people is like encouraging starvation. Yeah. Right. It's like that 40-year-old bag that is run for waterdale. I mean single handedly. Yeah. That's, that's, that's, that's, that's it. This lady had to be first win. I, I, I, I, I, I am so disgusted with for waterdale. I've lived here. It's enough to make your book isn't it, sir? I'm worth the you. I mean, you know, used to drive down a strip and see all those college students and young people now, they're a bunch of people on walkers on a strip and for waterdale. Well, I'm so sick of this place. It's like I'm, I'm ready to go get a high colonics. Okay. Hey, listen, that sounds like I'm making exciting weekend for you. Okay. Good. Open up a little bit of avenue for you. I mean. Okay. Well, what's up with Dr. Hang in there? Okay. Good luck to you, sir. All right. Bye. Okay. Well, what a way to start, huh? All right. Got a couple of open lines and date. People really impatient this morning. We're taking our damn sweet okay. When we're ready, we'll let you know. And would you take that picture of Alan Burke and get it off the table already? It is a full page ad in the Philadelphia bulletner, whatever that is. What is a paper? Philly, daily news. Like I said, the daily news. And he's just started there a couple of weeks ago. And he's already got a full page ad in the paper. Where's our full page? Even in like the weekly news or something. I don't see anything the weekly news. Well, that would be a start. Okay. That date number 751, WIOD, that 751, 9463, probably everybody's congregating at point east this morning. That's probably why date is a little bit slow. When he get out of point east, then it'll be okay. I thought about that. Okay. Hello. Hey there boys. It's the Bokka's Fatch. Are you doing okay? Good. I mean, what do you mean the Bokka's Fatch? That's why you told me the Congress. Okay. The Bokka's Fatch. Well, I could be anybody in Bokka's sir. The Bokka's Fatch Junior. I'm not on the real one. Okay. I got two stories for it at a TV accident. Oh, I got my whole on a second. Okay. Hold on. Now, are you really mobile here? Yeah. Okay. Look at that. Wait a minute. Oh, I just cut him off. Are you still there? Yeah. We're okay. I punched off instead of holding. I'll let's cut you off. Hold on a minute. Go ahead, sir. I'm here. Okay. Can I talk to you, no? Yeah. Yeah. I got a great idea. I know you don't do request. That's correct. And especially not today. Not after hearing that show yesterday. I can't blame you. Not after hearing that little nine year old harmless girl being, you know, they're getting rid of throw her and those people out on the street. I can't believe because there are a bunch of subhuman douchebags here. Close without saying. Oh, my, my, my idea was this, how about if we play request for those people that send $25 to the house? No. No. I think it's a great idea. Oh, I'm glad you do. We're not going to do that. We might do that one day next week. Not today. I don't mean it's not a good idea. We just aren't going to do it today. We should do it after Christmas. Okay. Because that's when people come up with a good idea. Well, since you're directing the show now, we'll, we'll do it any day. You think that's that. Whatever day you're in the mood for it. Okay. About the day after. Even if we hate it, even if we're not in the mood at all, who got millions of things we want to say, the day that you decide, that's today we'll do it. Okay. Because we're agreeable here. But 26. 26. Monday the day after Christmas. I don't know if we worked that way. But if we do, I doubt it. What do you mean we better work that I have to work that day. I'll work whenever they tell me I have to work. Not you. There's another guy's going to direct the show now. All right. Neil have a great day. It is a good idea, sir. Just don't take it personally. Okay. I wouldn't have a good day. All right. Now you're still there, right? Yeah. Okay. Hold on a second. Okay. Well, no, I got to do a break here. I want to. I don't know. Wait a minute. I want to give you something to listen. I want to give you something to expect you about. Okay. All right. Hold on. I'm telling that promise as soon as we come back. I'm like, I'm like, I'm just going to get my pants. I bet you are hold on. Okay. 20 minutes. You folks missed the really good stuff in during the breaks. They're really hot stuff. And one of these days, what we'll do is we'll just leave it on. Yeah. Well, we have a mystery on. We can have the spots playing in one channel and a really good stuff out of the other channel. Boca. Hello. That's you again. I'm sorry. It's me. Oh, you want to hold on a second. No. Just a joke. Oh, you didn't wait a minute. What do you mean your phone bill is this costing you? Oh, yeah. I caught, you know, my time is my money. Oh, I see. Excuse me. All right. Now I'm an important man. Well, don't fetch to us sir. All right. Listen. I had this television accidently other night. And I'm turning on a wise guy and Jerry Lewis is on there. Yeah. That is an accident. Anytime you see Jerry Lewis, it's a major accident. But the thing is, he's playing, you know, the rag merchant is. Yeah. Somebody who has a shop on Schmottaro and Helen did. He's playing the nutty rag merchant. And he's still in your material. Is he? Actually set on there. Uncle Mick have a nice look at the set it on the air. Did he really? Yeah. Jerry Lewis. Well, he's run out of material long time. Since Dean left him, he ran out of material. I couldn't believe the Dean went to Philadelphia. I know. I used to live in Philadelphia. And the Dean was on wise guy. One time. Yeah. You see how this fits together. I've always said that. I think like little pieces and a puzzle. They all fit together. But it's sort of like it's a long way down. You know what I mean? Yeah. It is a long way down your right. And real far. And by the way, do you have any like secret police? Like Neil Rogers secret police? Oh, yeah. They're all over town man. Right. You know, you have to hold a bunch of midwind more right now. Yes. Seriously, they're going to be checking for prints on the sweet and low. They're going to go into every condo man and I'm telling you the punishment is going to be swift and severe. Well, I think we should start like a Neil Rogers time time, a cooler selfless. Yeah. They were tearing down the Zeta force. I guess they are on I'm 95. Well, you probably haven't heard much about baby dock lately. Have you? No. We got him hidden away right over here. In fact, Henry Burrow has got him in the newsroom under wraps. Good. All right. That lamp. I'm telling you, getting this sound like Paul Jr. just a little bit. Wow. What kind of lamp is that? That was like a... A little bit of a container. Yeah. Was a sinister contrived lamp. I made the contrived lamp for the cane show, okay, sir? My grandmother listened to the cane, so yes. She was very, very upset. Why she really wants you an old fart, too? Ah, she's old, but she's a great lady, you know. Yeah. The great old fart. She's the place baseball with me. Really? And she was staying at Century Lewis. And we're listening to the cane show and she was getting very after. Yeah. How about you? Why? I mean, you said you better cop when you got home. Okay, listen. I think you ran out of material about three minutes ago. Okay. Okay. Good day. Now listen, you know, the thing of it is, you remember when I did the show was a long time ago with the couple from, was a tamarack, tamarack? Bonnie? What was their name? The wife's name was Bonnie Palmerance. Palmerance? Remember? No. Oh. What was it about? What a douche bag. I can't. I mean, the Palmerance and her husband and they were being kicked out because they had a baby. And it was in one of these complexes in Tamarack where they weren't supposed to have children. And the thing that really frosted my butt was that the people next door to them had a pet monkey. Mm-hmm. But a bottom line is the monkey was okay. Yeah. But the baby was like a threat to these people. Get it out of here. Get that thing out of here. So maybe some of those old people are into like, your relatives and stuff like that. Well, that was a long time ago. A couple of years. Well, that thing is still going on. I don't know what happened with them, but they were apoplectic. Very humane attitudes. Mm-hmm. Oh, yeah. That's the one thing about the old farads man. There's so humane understanding, compassionate and kind. You'll hear them. There were some who called an unsteaf show yesterday. You should only drop dead. You bastard. I'm that she was great. I'm not exaggerating. That's what she said. Sorry. She was terrific. A real, gentile lady. We'll manage. Hello. Good morning, guys. Yes, sir. Evidently you haven't heard about the new self-floor that you've seen as a man. It's more than attitude. Yeah. What they're trying to do is get rid of all the college kids. They already did that. They're long gone. We're not all in all of these, but that's it. Well, now they're working on the college kids or the high school kids and the grades school. If you're under 18, we don't want you. That's for damn sure. Kids realize that. I mean, they get their heads with diplomas. They're not even wet and they're out of this town. They're not even wet or you mean they're diplomas, guys. Yeah. I wasn't sure I knew what you were talking about. No. No. Oh, get these old people out of coronary during the show. I'm not that one. As far as the attorney yesterday, do have one question. What is appropriate discrimination? Whatever the hell he can make money doing. Okay, supporting and defending that Allen Becker man. And he listens to the show. Allen, you're a Schmendrick. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Allen, listen to the show. Allen Becker. Because I took because I know him. You know, I mean, from long ago, I think he was on the show. Many more people. You're sure that's back. That is correct. They doch back a mung brain. A subhuman, a heartless, cruel, cold calculating money grabbing. But other than that, he's a pretty good guy. Right. Never thought he was. He is not a bad guy, but it's just these attorneys. You know, they see those dollar signs and they see these old people. Man, just like the doctors down here. You know, it's like a game with a medicare. Yeah. And they got him coming back every other day. What do you want, Sharon? I don't know. You didn't hear the end of the show. Wow. I don't listen. Don't buy into that. Okay. He's still going to go back to his office. And he's still going to grab all the money you can for, you know, working for these condos. Don't buy into that. Don't be naive, Sharon. This pay by day. You have for Camille's office. A great idea. Is there a senior citizen discount with the plan? No. There isn't senior citizens 20% extra. Okay. Good deal. Okay. Have a great day, pal. You two guys. Bye. 1029 at WIOD. I can't believe you don't remember Bonnie Palmeran. The devil's a long time ago. I do. And her husband Rocky, who used to be the police chief on the beach. No, that's not her husband. No, that's not. It's a different Palmeran. Yes. That is a different family. I know that family. Do you? Yeah. And their daughter, uh, Vicki? Oh, Vicki. This is where she's found. But the audience is really getting into this. Anybody else? No. She works for CBS. How about her sister in law, Sadie? I think Vicki works on the Dan Rather Show. Last time I knew. I'll be damned. How about that? What the hell does that have to do with the call? I got kicked out and tried to remember it. But very, very vaguely. Foggy and vague. Yeah. Yeah. I do remember. Okay. Delray. Hello. On Neil. Yes. This is the youngest person living in Delray. Oh, in high school. Hold on. Yes. No. I'm 21. And I'm stuck in high point at Delray. You have to be like 112 to buy a condo here. Tell me, tell you if they are monitoring and listening to this call, you could be out on the street by the weekend. I think they're coming towards the house with gun. So I'm going to go in the other room and hide. But I was going there. If I could make a request, you might be interested in. I'm going to leave here around seven o'clock tonight. I was one of you could fly over high point drop the A-bomb. And that should take care of. No, no. We're just dropping a small neutron bomb that are eliminated to people and leave the building. Well, that'll do it. So that's my request for the day take care. Okay, sir. Bye. I'd like to like they work coming to get him. You notice how quick he got on real quick. Or he ran out of here like a bad out of hell. Here's a leaf-fowler report from Jupiter, which is right next to your rain as hello. Hello, Neil. Yes, sir. I'm becoming a chronic, but I can't do anything about it. Let's hope we need a chronic in Jupiter. Huh? I said we need a chronic in Jupiter. Well, I told you some of the salesmen. I'm not on the road all the time. I don't get to call when I'd like to. But often enough. Listen. Last night. The tower comes on and he plays this clip and it starts out. This is leaf-fowler. And then you hear the eggs crack. Oh, no. Oh, no. No, no. Wait a minute. Now he's gone too far. Can you believe it? Now the man has gone too far. There's one thing when he rips off all your other material. But when he started to do a little stick-lock and rip those off, that's too much. And then he starts that back and I can see. That was Capri-Des idea. Yeah, he's the one that done Zeta. He's the one that put all of the, he got a whole bunch of those in Spanish and English. And you cranium? I thought that was back at ING. Almost. Pretty close. Yeah, well, you know, there are some living and breathing people up here and in Palm Beach. Well, yeah, sure. Very easy for you to say. Maybe if you got a search party together, you could find 10, okay? Well, I don't think so. But, they don't worry, yeah. Keep it up. I mean, yeah, keep it up, yeah. Easy for you to say, pal. Okay, have a good one. Okay. So to speak, boy, all these people, they're a little cute double on none this morning. You know, I'm talking about getting ready for an exciting weekend. Boy, they're dreaming. We got to call an online open rather in Palm Beach 655 WI-E. We call on that line and Lee is calling next week. Oh, I thought he should defend it. So now he needs the whole weekend to create some more BS so that he has a real good thing for it. And not only that, Steve's not in the building. Have you noticed this in Cestuous relationship that we can only speak to Lee when Steve is the, Yes, exactly. Middleman. The middle, well, they have a word for that. When Steve acts as the intermediary. Uh-huh. Okay, we got a Tom Jika and Christmas card report from Boka. Hello. Okay, first that Christmas card thing you ready yesterday about that kid with the Gittis book of world records. Yeah. It's a hoax story from the Associated Press Thursday saying that it's a hoax. It started out with someone in England and it just got out of control and there's no substance to it. Really? I'll send in the article if you want to see it. Okay, well, I won't read it again. Okay. But it did sound, it was a real heart-wending thing, you know? Well, that's the point. And the other thing is Jika's got a job. I know that. Oh, okay. That's it. The board of all news, right? That's right. It'll start with you. Right. Bill Kelly is leaving, which we told this on a year at least two weeks ago. Sorry. No, no, that's okay. See, it kind of cancels out. You had one, you know, then you contribute and the other one is terminal. So it evens out. Okay. Like a big zero, you know what I'm saying? I know what you're saying. So you've gotten all this money from millions out from all these celebrities. Have you gotten anything from Russia, Wacestershire? Not yet, but we're waiting. I'm sure Russia's going to come up with a big one. I thought he would send in $2,000. Doors. Yeah, that's a good idea. Who don't cock, too? Five thousand dollars. That's it. That's it. Excellent thinking, Bill. Thank you. Okay. How do you do? You too. And then be great. And then we'll scream about it too. If Russia or Don Cox will send in a check for the commilisans, we will not only announce it on the year, we'll scream it. We have to scream. Yeah. And we'll use that Western Pennsylvania door. I'm not a dollar. I'll do it. Trust me. Anyway, I'm done usual for me to scream on a show, but... But... Yeah, we can make an exception. Maybe just a little practice, actually. Okay. Okay. All right. 1034. Henry Barrow is going on vacation next week. We hope Henry has a wonderful time, but not too good. Because we have to be here. And he's got a little news update and we'll come back on 610 WIO Day. Good day. All right, you. Thank you very much. As here is the king. I don't have a middle round much for a while. But I want y'all to know what I'm here to rock and roll in. I don't think it over here. But it's Christmas. And I have to give y'all a special Christmas message. I'm going to say to your priest. Right, uh... How about a little piece of that to hide going by? Thank you. I don't want to. I want to go to the shrine. Christmas is a time of food. Time of joy. The time for living. And I sure would love it. Six slides that feature you got there. I can't. What will I? More or less. Oh yeah, Christmas. Christmas to me means family. If family means friends. The friends means getting together. And getting together means. Eight. Five past few that come to take. Which place? Well, I like it. I can remember. Nothing will say to you right now. You know, I may be a big star. Maybe too big. But ain't nobody so big. You can't reach out to help in the hand. I help in a hand. Or would you hand me a helping of those mashed potatoes over there? Which place? What? Meg, I'm on. Now like I was playing with. I know about it from baggy can't. It's too tough to help a friend of me to eat over the holiday season. I was thinking of season. You want to pass me that self-sugar when you get a chance? I can. Yeah, just. Just don't screw the color. That's right. I don't want. So this Christmas. I don't know if y'all take a tear from old. Hey, I was. Now, I don't leave those steak-tap fried-water. You know what I mean? You know, I appreciate it. I want you to remember. Well, power to God's great big family. And you know God made man and do his own image. Look in the mirror. I'd have to say God must be a big, big symbol. You know what I mean? I'd like you to. But I especially want y'all to remember this one last thing. And y'all, as homeers, Christmas, spring and that popcorn up on the tree. You save up big, big bow for the king. Extra butter. No, I mean. I'd like you to hear. I'd like you. I'd like to learn more. That's OK. On this 1040, 20-11 at WIOD, we have a wonderful call from South Beach on one. Hello. Yes, hi. Hey, brother, bird. I'd like to hear your laughing. And the doctor told me I was in the hospital, vegetable hospital. And they cut off the wrong legs, eh. And they told me to wait and not to worry about to live. It's a laugh. Yeah, that's pretty funny. They said, uh, that's right. They could have been worse. They could have cut off something else, OK. They could have been better than a two-gay. They really, yeah. And it's a good work for a laugh. And so I'm seeing a laugh man. That's the other way. And Neil, I enjoy those schools from the things you have. Well, that's great. I have my little tape recorder right here every time you're at a play one. Yeah. OK. Get that team with Ron. Thank you, man. OK. Well, Dr. Vot is going to straighten you out. Palo, OK. You have a go. There he goes, man. Wow. Cut off the wrong leg. Good. No big deal. He laughed. Hey, little mistake. Anyway, we have an open line in Palm Beach 655. WIOD. Don't get me started on doctors, OK? Yeah. The lawyers are bad, but at least most of the time they don't kill you. Most of the time. Most of the time. But doctors, that's another story. I mean, most of them. I would say about 80% of doctors haven't got any idea. I mean, any idea. What the hell is going on? No. All they know is that they've got a revolving door. They keep sticking their head out to make sure that there's somebody in every one of those little cubicles. And that's basically what it's all about. And they make sure you give them a check. And they write a lot of those prescriptions, man. Because those detailed men come in. I mean, now they got detailed women. Have you noticed that? They're women. Oh, yeah. A attractive young ladies who come in and petal those pills. And of course, they have some extra things to offer the doctor, I guess, right? Yes. Yes. Some extra little goodies on the side to make sure that they write lots and lots of those prescriptions. For good things like felting. Miami. Hello. Yeah. Neil. Just a little to no two quick things. First, I have my contribution to Camila's house in the mail. Thank you. The other thing I wanted to tell you is a true story. I beat the horses for a few dollars in the side of the celebrated my favorite watering column. I walked in. And the report, guys, at the end of the bar, there was this one blue hair sitting in just a couple of stools down from where I was going to sit. And she walked out of place in the joint. But I, like I said, I've won a few dollars in the called bar. The bar turned to a bracelet very gives everybody in the place a drink on me. Have one yourself. And do me a favor. Even give this little do-he-bag your drinks. The very comfortable bird. He says, Bill, Bill, please. He says, you know, I'm in the old rider's friend too, but you can't say that in here. This is ladies and gentlemen. I said, all right, give this old lady a drink. So Barry said, okay, man, this fellow wants to buy a drink. What would you like? She said, vinegar and water. Yeah. You were right. True story. Yeah. She probably was Alan Massey Gales grandmother. Probably. Okay, sir. Thank you. Incredible. As we follow, we said, don't keep stealing these lines. You know, that lead follower. We got another follower report on seven. Hello. Hi. Guess who he went on yesterday as a guest. How many guesses do we get now? Is it somebody that Steve had on the last two weeks? Yeah. It wasn't an 18th space queen again. Was it? No. Wait, no, wait a minute. Don't tell who? Mr. X. The conservative Mr. X. Oh, no. Yeah, put the microphone down on the table. I am going to blow my brains out on the air today at high noon. Oh, this time you got to be kidding me. No, and you know what they were talking about? Now we know why Mr. X is the way he is. He rides a motorcycle without a helmet. Yeah. That's what they were talking about. And can't you come at the same time? That's it. But I thought you loved and know that. See, you do understand that Mr. X and Lee Fowler are part of this male bondage team. That would, would, would Steve. You do understand that. Don't you want to hang out together and everything's like they're all glued together at the hip. Wow. And yeah, I'm serious. Of course, I don't know what they do beside that, but boy, there's something really bizarre going on there. That will make the old turkey. Mr. X, you know, isn't this incredible talk about these chronic guests? The only thing worse than a chronic caller, because you can hang up on a chronic caller is a chronic guest. The people who are compulsive who just have to get that fixed. They're like bad Mexican food. They just keep coming back. That's correct. Can I ask you to confirm a rumor for me? I understand that Alex of course is going to Europe on vacation. I don't know anything about Christmas. I understand that what he took his dog into the house. Oh, no, sir. He kind. I am. I'm trying. No, you're going to say something terrible. I just have a feeling and a bit of my stomach. And I will get emotional again and a mother will call him on a phone and tears. Don't do it, sir. Please. There's him right, huh? With him. He was taking his dog into the kennel yesterday to drop it off. And he was walking in behind a man with a litter of dobermans to have their ears trimmed. I understand they grabbed out and took him in there. Is that true? To have his ears trimmed? You've seen those suckers. Now he don't have, he's got fairly large ears, but not like Dumball. Well, I heard the Disney's after him for the next movie. Oh, your cruel sir. Your nasty and cruel. But it's kind of me. And his mother is in tears now as we speak. Well, I'm sorry. I'm a bad person. You know, really are, but at least you admit it. That's good. That's a good start. That's excellent beginning for therapy from me. I'm going to go with myself right now. Okay. Goodbye. Did he say he's going to go with himself? I can't. He's the high priest of Disney movies. Bistop. Oh, I'm behind this little TV news. He's anchored with a world. Oh, oh. Oh. The stupid days. That him always brings victory. But I'll return to the world. It's mostly an incredible world. Oh. Oh. No. No. No. I do well, I love it. It's below the test. Oh. I need to know. And draw a mobile world. Feel the fire like this. I don't want to be a single one. Oh. And draw a mobile world. I do well with this below the test. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. From the tunnel, I guess at the queue and hey, where's that going? What's he doing with that machine gun? Oh my god. Who's there? He was fed up with reading one story after another about drugs and violence. Now, she watched a right to roll and rewrite the news in a whole starring and vicious. So, she'll be pleased. I'll see you tonight at five six hundred and a lot of things. Go. And fall. She took the news into her own hands. What are you guys going to do with me when I get through with you? There won't be enough of you left to make a good suit. Hey, her done, no. And starring and vicious, also starring Carl Weather's is toy Flutterdale. And done, not, and done, no. There's a stationary plot over the bed. And fall. He's ready for the news. And fall. Coming soon. Okay, I had to play those two back to back because it just fits so well, right? That is in another follower report we did that. Okay, boy, panic. Thank God. Because I think we could have his whole audience called him by the end of the show. We've already had two or three. And we get another three or four calls. That could be it. Okay, Lee. It's just a joke, Lee. And what I'm saying is Lee is a what's his name would say. How soon they for you? J. My Michael's would say. Just a joke. And every time he said it, he was talking about that show. How come we haven't heard from Dr. Vats. Yeah, boy, that'll make my week if because it is Friday. That was the real Dr. Vats Junior. That was the real Dr. Vats Junior. That was the Junior. Fort Lauderdale. Hello. Good morning, now. Yes, sir. And good morning, you do. But to you too, but. Okay. Wonderful now. I was kind of like an afterthought. I know. I like the. I'm first time caught by the wind. You're great. And I started listening to show. That in 40 cents will get your real watery cup of coffee. Well, back to the start with your shot. And then on my clock radio, my library to the A. I'm often the engine to the bright dots sometimes. It's here. And it's going off and down to your shed. Like me, I've been a little bit late at night. And if I need to be very intelligent and quick, but I can't say to say to say to them, I'm going to say to them, but the month is like a water and but water and down. Drop the version of that McMahon. But any point, I was wondering. You hang up on this guy. No, no, no, no. I said, no, no. I said, no, no. I said, no, no, no. You hang up on. The only thing he's trying to be creative. Come on. He didn't just say you were a jerk or something. He's creative. He's getting testy. He's getting hostile. He's slow. I don't think he's going to be like, like, not our mer sometimes. Well, that is true. He's not all here. Sometimes he's fantasizing about being someplace else. I think they can do what if this moment, like any place. But like any place. But I want it out to you. So about it. I'm going to talk all over you. Go ahead. It seems to me that the body is the bug you. It's not like the radio stuff set. And more time, not any other's radio stuff. That's right. That's what the audience wants. We have a bunch of satis here. So this is a big SNM town. I think you're here. You deserve your costume. Your costume is really good. Yeah. I think you can't go with giving them a... Well, let me say this to you. Sir, I hope your second call is a lot more constructive and better than this one. Okay? This is first call ever. He's ripping you and he's critiquing me. We don't need any more program direct. Sir, we've already got one and he's brain dead. What I want to say to you, sir, Neil, would have to dump. Really? That hot fool. That hot fool. That's so unnecessary. I don't know. Wait a minute. It's okay. I have an open line in Boga at 278-9463. That's 278 Wild. And we'll come back. Right, Michael. Right, Michael. This is the real bad good top at men. Ladies and gentlemen, we have, in our hands right now something so shocking. What a day. Does this incredible? Now this is going to make up. Well, wait a minute. Let's talk to Dr. Faz. It is Dr. Faz. Faz going on. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the man who singlehandedly destroyed the Jay Michael show. Although we didn't need a lot of help, but this man put him right over the top. There's men at the Jay Michael and we going. Okay, good call. Now listen. Listen, we have, and I want to thank Stephen in Miami, who evidently has the original. So we can make all the copies we want. Okay. We have. This is, you talk about male coming in this place. We will send to you as our very own Christmas gift. It's probably going to be late because it's already the 16th year. Yeah. But all you got to do is send us, will even let them spring for the envelopes here. Okay. They got more money than God in this damn place. Just send us a request to postcard or letter. And we will send you as a holiday gift from WIOD. You're very own, boon in the box. Look at this. Is this incredible or one? Talk about the oldies. Now this is a picture of a young Pat boon. This is what it was in college. The College of Musical Knowledge is something like that. And he has a cardboard, small cardboard box. Which he is sticking. Well, you'll have to see it for your show. Yeah. Unbelievable. This is from Hustler Magazine. Okay. So it's kosher. Anybody who wants it certainly is entitled to it because it's already it's out there. Is this incredible? I never thought we would see the old boon in the box again. No, I will suggest to you. Those of you who don't have real good vision. Probably need one of those magnifying things you buy in the drugstore. You know, one of those reading, you know what I'm talking about. The Mel Palomar Tell us. Yeah. The Mel Palomar Tell us Go Junior. Yeah. You'll have to have to see exactly what it is. I mean, what you see, I guess is what you get. It will make you feel like you're fully get or something like that. I don't know what you said. It'll give you a chuckle for the holidays. Okay. So just send all your requests. This is serious now. This is going to be, you will set you free. And when you look at this and you think of Pat, you know, on TV doing his pseudo religious Goody two shoes, all of that other crap, you know, I am not a thief or whatever. I'll make you really think. It'll make you ponder the situation as Casey would say. It'll be so ponderous that you'll just fall on the floor and laughter. You'll think of Debbie too. Debbie Boone. Yeah. You light up my life. She'll be singing as you look at the old boon in the box. And the expression on his faces, what always got me. Look at that as if, oh look what I found. You know, it's not much, but it's the best I can do. Holy Toledo Pat. So anyway, what is it? If you'd like one, just send us your name and address on a card or in a letter and set it to Boone in the box. And we won't even ask, I could do another Camilla sourcing on us, but this is too important. Okay. Because we want people even Schlepper who can't afford to send a nation to have these two. For their own personal collection, this could be worth a lot of dose someday. And just send two Boone in the box, Carineal Rogers WIOD Miami 3 3 1 4 1. Have you guys ever seen this before? Trust me, it's from in the box. Actually give you one. If Nick will make the effort, he's not going to get up out of the chair. You've got to see this. Trust me. It's worth getting that. He's not going to get up. Okay. He's afraid to look. Ha ha ha. Believe me, it's nothing you haven't seen before. Okay. Nothing to be afraid of. It's pretty hysterical. Anyway, that's Boone in the box, Carineal Rogers WIOD Miami 3 3 1 4 1. Another reason I'm happy to do this is I want to have so much mail coming in here that they get her Hearny out and just having the lift box is. Yeah, we got out to the Dean. This is a great call. Here's somebody who's an April worth of Mlips fan. Yeah, remember a couple weeks ago you guys were talking about USA today and they had, I guess they had some Contest to pick the best lips. Yeah, that's right. I had the luxury of seeing April were them once and I think she has the most luscious look. Oh, you mean Hot Lips were them, yeah. Yeah, her voice just gets, I think every man in South Florida going in her lips. Yeah, really. I think she should have been number one in the USA today list. It's pretty obvious, doesn't take much for you, pal, right? Well, yeah, I mean you've seen Eric, you tell the people she's gorgeous. She really is a very attractive, super wonderful lady. Yeah, she's got that voice. She should be on some of those phone lines, they'll fan it to the line. Okay, well, listen, we're having an early Ross over to your house right now to fill in. Okay, no, no, we don't want to. We've seen our lean. Oh, okay. Like I said, if you find Mount Rushmore in your living room, you'll understand. I have a duck one thing. That was cute.

Yeah, I think so and of course The dolphins are gonna wrap out an incredible season with another big win this weekend It's not the last game is it? Yeah, is it real for them? Boy not for everybody but for us trust me if you wait long enough to really plan this weekend Piper high Well good luck to them and they're two point under dogs Well, that's a lot. You get a Piper high, you know CBS really It's nice. You know, we talked about it yesterday briefly. It didn't it's not a big thing It is by the way those kids at KPX. They have terminals. It's yes, they do just like you see that Yes, I did just say always a simply faced little kids who want to get into broadcasting Okay, forget it. Don't you understand I've been telling you for a long time go do an honest job somewhere Go get into some field of endeavor where you don't have to become Totally frustrated and dehumanized and tortured and Why not out on the street with no job for two three years at a time forget it? This is this is the worst yeah, in fact go rent one of those little subret hotdog cards Okay much better business much more profitable and you can be your own boss Okay, and if you have a nasty customer you pull out one of the hotdogs and say stick it Mm-hmm, where the moon don't shine. Okay, but not this But anyway, they got those pimply faced kids over at KPX and I was gonna start to disagree with CBS because Channel six up by me there in plantation you can't it comes in so bad even on a cable It's a joke. It's got all these specs and lines and dots and popping and puking It's horrendous. I keep telling you you are gonna watch CBS from Palm Beach and so the bottom line I'm trying to make is that here. They're trying to jump all over KPX There have been no complaints from anybody to the FCC that it's interfering with channel six Is signal, but now they try to get them off the air, but as I think about it, you know It's it sinks in if they don't give it to some of those pimply face kids I'm gonna join CBS and do everything I can I didn't you hear in the story just a joke by the way that CBS made an offer to pipe or a compromise or It turned it down that would have happened They were gonna send them a couple of cases of acne stat and that's not gonna do I thought it was a great idea See acne stat and you know who used to pedal that you remember the scandal about that? No, it was pat and his daughter Debbie Yikes it was and the bottom line was they never had a pimple even on their butt That's right whole family has got skin like a baby and Judging other things like a baby from the balloon in the box picture, but And so they made him stop it because they were giving phony Indoorse right I remember that now that was years ago What you got a memory yeah that boony would come on and say hey just rub a little bit of this in it And of course we don't know what he was where But let's get serious pat okay give it a rest pay phone in Miami hello Nice yeah on a pay phone they hung up That's a real jackass, you know, it's somebody who'd call from a hello hello like I said Are you on a pay phone?

It's like they've built this creeping Geographic outdoor funeral parlor and now we're all suffering from these greedy developers Who just wanted to jam all these old people, you know in God's waiting room and Now the rest of us pay for it Big time Maybe we ought to go after the developers and bring them in here have them explain why don't they build a lot of nice housing for You know middle age people and young couples and people with children and pets and life in their house Well, maybe we ought to make them answer it.

I have a 10 dollar tab every morning, but this time These are big spenders, you know less a $12 Tip I'm a 10 dollar tab Wow, even holy Toledo That probably makes up for the dime that they've been leaving every other time Exactly, so it's first that a donation to the Knoza if you're gonna go out Yeah, I'm waiting for the donation from those of five couples at one the 28 million wouldn't that be that's okay?

That's a lot of cram. We were talking about visit now the old cliche It's a nice place to visit but you wouldn't want to live there. I agree. I agree. I think when I say I'm for New York I always make sure people know it's an upstate New York is the city and upstate New York are totally different On a visit it's but it's far being a tourist no you don't want to go to upstate New York and see the mountains I mean that's about as boring you can see that on a postcard But you've been there many times well if you if you it sucks so bad why have you been there many times? Why did you go back if somebody force you? Here comes the reverse by here it comes on a screen. I lived there oh well I guess that's an excuse Well, no wait a minute, but you know in a way this is good because at least he's saying he lived there and it sucks He's got an excuse or leaving Unlike a lot of the New Yorkers who are down here who keep complaining it was so great there and how it sucks here Yeah, okay, and you say to them well if it was so great there how many left? Okay, then I do agree to live there. I wouldn't want to live there for all the money in the world I've been approached twice by WABC under their former ownership When they weren't as Neanderthals they are now and Quite frankly I have very mixed emotions about working in New York as I would live there And I sure wouldn't want to live in Jersey no I must accept it the job one time in Trent and many many years ago And I drove up there and I drove around the city and I looked around and I put my nose clip on God what a horrible place But I never even I waited I met the manager and a people in the station and I was just on the verge I was gonna be the program director that station and I just drove out of town and I never went back good thing Trust your instincts Stinks is the word yeah, but I love visiting up there Yeah, New York to the greatest in New York is exciting.

I mean you just go nuts But by Friday I was ready to go home. Yeah. Oh, yeah, I have to get days never a couple of the I see a weekend would be nice nice to spend five days there's something like what I lived in Boston And I had my first car I had a little 1960 corvare and a couple of friends in mine Would get in the car and we would head to New York which from Boston's not a long drive Never a lot of miles and almost every weekend we would wind up in New York That was back that's in 1961 almost 30 years ago Now I'm not saying there wasn't any crime, but it isn't like it is today Those days you could walk the streets at two or three in a morning and there'd be so many people out You'd feel safe you didn't have to you know keep your hand on your wallet and keep looking around you Not that way and it was just tremendous. It was an incredible experience Boy, this is like a little bit of nostalgia boring in it. Okay. Let's go to this mobile. Hello. Oh, Neil.

You got here I get rear-handed by the Cadillac on Believe so I stopped about I'd be say ten inches from this lady and she's suffering you know about four inches of step She decides that in the middle of the intersection after carving an accident she's completely oblivious to The balls are right a cigarette Oh, wait wait Sir can I straighten you up? Yeah, can I explain something to you? Yeah, you don't understand that there's a thing on the beach It's like an unwritten code She was probably one of the comma-cazy pedestrians No, seriously, I'm Colin Zabin who is very big the you must be over the age of 80 and what you do is you wait until the Don't walk lights starts flashing And you then step onto the middle of the road and you dare the motorist to hit you hoping Hoping in praying that somebody will Okay, those are the comma-cazy pedestrians on the beach there with there's more After she got the lighting her cigarette yeah, through the match with her still lit on the roof on the hood of my car Well, that should tell you something I've Completely emotionally drained now.

I mean he's about as liberal as you can get Right sure Now where does he fit in With Mr. X and Lee fouler Ballant you know maybe no, I don't understand that at all. I mean Steve I can understand because Steve you know is oblivious I mean he just ignores the philosophy I mean when Hermann Gering comes over for lunch Yeah, you know he's out of bed dry. He just ignores that stuff But Norman and the Mr. X and Lee father that is a strange group. Yeah, it's our it's basically Mr. X and Norman Kent And they're mad is really and are they involved in the male bonding those two I think they are shock Isn't Oh God Now I haven't seen Mr. X's check yet have you I mean I keep here at about how he's got all this money He's loaded he's got millions.

I want to give you some hands for keeping the tree that way. First you can get an anti-transparent from a nursery day. This is sprayed on the foliage and slows the loss of moisture into the air. Then you want to have a large capacity tree stand because the average tree requires about a quarter for serviting the water for day. You ought to check to stand every day and replenish what the tree has sloped up. If you'd like to have my famous do it yourself super handyman's tree preserve uniform. You're here it is. Get some horticultural iron powder from the nursery store and get a bottle of caro crystal clear corn syrup from the supermarket and while you're there get a bottle of laundry bleach into a gallon of hot water you add four tablespoons of the iron powder, four teaspoons of the bleach and two cups of the corn syrup mix and pour this into the tree stand and check it every day and as needed add hot water. This keeps you tree fresh and makes it less likely to be a fire hazard. I'm Al Carroll the super handyman brought to you by home depot America's do it yourself warehouse. You can search but there's only one. I never call them ready before but never last. They have turned us down trust me. In fact I've been wondering all day I feel like my voice is a little strained. Yeah because they've turned this thing down. Somebody has turned our thing down okay? So whoever turned it down please turn it back up. It's too low. I like it like where you can hear it booming. No not booming but like resonated. Yeah okay we have a duck report on six. Hello. Yes. Yeah it's Neil. Good afternoon. Got a duck report here. Says here I was reading the paper it says duckies to raise fraternity. One of the duck was familiar with this. Duckies? Duckies to raise fraternity. That would the headline actually says. It's an exactly says in the sun setting off. Duckies. We're probably some quack wrote that. More than 3000 rubber ducks wearing goggles and I wanted to be a duck. I wanted to know if the duck was going to be there and well I don't know if he's planning on be there but he did have some strange looking goggles on when he came in this morning so that should give you a little tip off. That could be it. It's supposed to be on the new river tomorrow at noon for charity. That way. Yeah. Allers a chance for him. Make it big. You and noodles can not. Right? Right? Okay. I just thought I'd jump in there and say that and don't get no larger than me. Okay. All right. Good day. Good day. 1.38. 22 till 2. Steve has opened phones today. And the only disappointment I have we first of all we only had one lady caller today I think all day and right. That was the lady heard the church. We had no women again today. No. We had a bunch of you. We had all bunch yesterday but today the women are well this is a bad time for women. Stopping. Are there other shopping until they just you know those credit cards are drained every ounce of blood in them. A lot of that going on. Yeah. Oh yeah they're going okay we have an open line in three of magnitude now this is incredible. We still have 22 minutes to kill here in date 751 WIOD and in Palm Beach 655 9463 655 WID well I give the numbers for Palm Beach because they're basically they're dumb. Miami. Hello. Hi. Um um. Oh lady. I'm a cooler. Not a Glacier. Oh it's a young kid. Yeah we're all skipping school. Why? Why? Because it's the last day of the school year. I'll see you're getting like an extra day right. Getting a head start. Is this what they mean when they talk about the head start program? Something like that. Yeah. Um yeah it's international. That was real too. I was in a cute. Yeah. Flora's order called in an hour and a half ago they said five minute delivery 20 minutes ago and it's still isn't here. They're upset and I understand. Well let me ask you a question. Do they ordinarily deliver or do they just do that for us? They do deliver and it's been an hour and a half. You know if we would be having to bring in food all the time if I weren't on the diet the food would have been here like by 1130 or to 12. Yeah but that's your breaks man when you don't rate it goes to show you how much weight you put. So Carmine what's going on maybe Carmines is the track today because I know Carmine would never tolerate that. Yeah. He's not the track. Yeah we definitely don't want to create any bad vibes with that. Because we love their food. Super folks over there and they have the best all kinds of good stuff but Cheryl is having an interest break down. She's about ready to start doing cartwheels in the atrium. Okay. So come on Carmine cut the nonsense all right. Let's get with it. Can you believe that? Probably the guy ate it on the way over. Okay. I mean it'll ever you guys got to eat too. Boca hello. Yes. Is this male? Yes. I have three things to say and then a butt. The first thing is I can barely hear you. Oh I think you're part. That's so much better yeah. How's what you talk in the phone? Can you hear me now? Yes. I sure can. All right. I have three things to say and then a butt. First thing is I'm enjoying your pro. You have a butt? With a butt. Okay. The second thing is you will want to have a occasion to be very kind to my husband myself and again I'm just going to say thank you. And the third thing is that I sent a check of which I can afford to come out of the house. Now the butt is this. And when they show the pictures of the people, the people eating. They always show young men from between 20 and 50. Those that should be out working instead of the family. No. I'm not criticized. I'm not quite sure. I'm not quite sure. I'm criticizing. Why don't they show the family's eating rather than the young men that could be working? Yeah. And should do I'm not good at saying. Well why do you keep saying could be and should be and should be? See when you don't have a place to live and you don't have any clothing. It's not also easy to get yourself cleaned up and take a shower and shave and get dressed in a presentable way so you can go out and look for a job and have an address. You know when you go for a job generally have to fill out an application and you have to have a full number and then address it. So when you keep saying, should be should be should be. It's very obvious where you're coming from and I don't want to talk to you. Okay, you old bag. You make me sick. You make me nauseous. I was very kind to her and I don't know what she's talking about but it's just the bottom line. It's always got to be a butt. Okay? So in other words basically she would like her money to go to feed the families but these young people and of course what she'd understand that a lot of these families have young children too. Definitely. All right including teenage children who also could be working under different circumstances she was all hard man that's all I can say. Anyway it's 142 and let's go to Hollywood. Okay we right toward the end here we go is get a couple and I'll put it in and we have some questions here. What's the question? What is the question? I checked the kneel. No no God for what if you want a couple of thousand because Camilla's house. Camilla's CAMI LOS. Okay. Well in this great right in the middle of the show are just coming in here as long as they got money for Camilla's house we don't mind the other day. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Right. For this just $100. How many tickets? Tell me tapes can we get? $100. $100. Right. Five tapes. Five tapes. Oh yeah. How am I going to know that though? Well I give you five tapes I guess right. Yeah that's it he is he doesn't understand it. They figured it out. Yeah. That's cool. That's not we always like when the salespeople listen it's very good. Okay it's 143 and we got boy how much open lines does since you came in I don't know what happened. And they'd 751 Wild and Broward 524 WID. We might just play something about 10 minutes long hearing kill as Polish show it's unbelievable. It's incredible. Have it done already. That's okay. We understand. Miami hello. Hi me I'm gonna show it story here for you some Lionel Play World last night. I'm trying to pick out some Christmas presents and I hear this young kid talking to this little old girl carrying on about how he's a radio superstar and if she holds on to his coat tail so to speak he'll make her one awesome that he talks to Neil all the time and that Neil mentions him every day on a radio and I start laughing and you know wait wait wait wait wait this is a Lionel Play World. Yeah. Couldn't have been STEM could have. All 50 had his little stem on his shirt. No bet he did. You know how to put it back where belong. It was incredible. It was I was in the midst of a superstar and I was I didn't know what to say. You know what to say you should have just laughed out loud. Well besides that then the girl came over later and said if she's serious if you really on the radio said yes to am dial. She says what does STEM say and I said nothing that I can remember. Nothing memorable whatsoever. No and I'm working down here in Kendall and I'm taking down E-Mac and Bollyos. Really? Wait a minute were they in town and country? Yep. Yeah. Of course everybody went out in that place. Yeah. They well now they have a new management and the same people that handle bassite. It's a good looking shopping center but man you could have a you could have a bowling tournament and there were no problem. There's nobody in the center. Well E-Mac and Bollyos made a big mistake see they were up there and what is that really? They did a lot or hell whatever that is and we had like twice we had 2,000 people there they sold so much ice cream they almost ran out of it and but they didn't want to advertise they were very tight with their bucks and they just didn't want to you know do anything to promote it and they weren't a very that shopping center is in receiverships a matter of fact. It's almost as desperate as the one you were talking about and they're long gone up there too. I've got one of the I've got two questions real quick questions. Yeah. With everybody referring to on bird as Ed McMan to STEM make him Ed Junior. Yeah. Ed McMan Junior because we just say Ed Junior that could be our friend Ed and for a lot or they don't want to lump him in that can. And then the other thing with the with the topics it's been doing especially about the crotch watching that sounds very reminiscent of stands wearing your way to somewhere show. Really? If he criticized so much. Well as a matter of fact on Monday he's going to do a show about his wife wearing his underwear watching crotch is which is going to be mind boggling. Okay. Down and more and more like stand. There you go. Don't tell him that. Okay. Good day. 145 at Wiod and here we are man. I'm trying to just losing it. Our way here's another check. Thank you very much Gary and the money just comes pouring in here. There's another 120. So let me just add that to our total. It's almost like the jury Louis telephi. It's a race. 4359 Monday we're definitely going way over 15 grand right because I know that all the chiefs gates out there. That's it. Knock off the beeper in here too. Man, he sales people. He come in and just disrupt the whole goddamn show. It's incredible. But anyway, like I said over the weekend I know that everybody will do their homework assignment including a lot of those old parts like the ones who want to lottery. Who want to plant that money in the ground with them when they go. Instead of doing that why not each of those couples should take a grand. That would be a nice round figure right five grand. Each one of those couples right out of a thousand dollar check for Camilla sauce and mail it in over the weekend and we're not going to send them any tapes because I don't think their pacemakers could take the shock okay from the tapes. But that would be a very nice gesture in there a parting moment. Let's see, Boko on five. Hello. Hey Neil. How you doing? Okay. Hey Neil, I'm yesterday morning you had a call of who was going through a term-fike booth and you started talking about the problems you had when you got off the term-fike on sunrise Boulevard. Yeah. Now I want to ask you, did you recently start taking the term-fike in the afternoon on the way home? I always take it. Oh, the reason I asked is, I drive the truck and I go through that area every day and the last two days I've seen you yesterday I weighed that you would. I think you were so caught up in steasher that you were kind of oblivious. Yeah, I was listening to that Alan Becker and I was swearing at the radio. Yeah, I don't blame you on that. Listen, I just want to give you some advice when you go through that area. Yesterday I noticed you got up and back of a gravel truck and that's two nights of a car you drive to get in back of those dudes because- No, no, let me tell you the big mistake I made. Don't get in the lane where the blonde girl is, you know, because she is no interest in giving you the tickets. This is a sunrise. Wait a minute, I'm thinking to the one where you get off. I'm talking about where you get on. Okay. In other words, where the golden blades is and you get on the turnpike and all she's doing is just handing you out the ticket, okay. But she has no interest in that. She's got a girl on the other side. You know, in each booth when they're both open. There's, you know, somebody on one side, somebody on the other. This blonde girl, she's not interested in doing a job. She is a yenta and all she went, bye bye bye bye, and she's having a personal conversation and she's like on an angle and she's basically facing the other girl, paying no attention to the cars. So like grudgingly as an afterthought, she will give you the ticket if you stare at it long enough. But somebody ought to just give her, you know, what for? I mean, she's out of her mind. Yeah, why do you don't have problems? The only problems I have when I'm getting off, especially when I'm getting off the turnpike. Are these people get up in front of you and they pay and then they go through this long feel with the girl right? Oh yeah, I do want to have a little chat. Yeah, just like it to check out on the supermarket where they want to have a little chat. I know. I have no idea what they talk about. I've never been able to figure that out. Yeah, I don't know. What would you say? I can't think of what to say to a toll booth. Well, I'm worth it. Most of them I think asked for the ration someplace that we take about a half hour to come and get a map, you know, get a map. Yeah, but anyway, that's a pretty car you're driving. I just want to warn you to stay away from the gravel trucks if I go down to especially around state road 84 area. Yeah, they will find your car bad and I imagine the hood of the Corvette. We do a number on it. That would be worse than even spitting on my car, right? That's exactly right. Okay, thanks a lot. Okay, Neil, bye. 149 at WIOD flores is here, which ought to pacify these maniacs out here in the office, or just they're in heat. They're really are. They're just going nuts. And I think we'll take our last break here. None too soon, we'll come right back. Well, right here, like a river. As here is the king. I don't have a middle round much for a while, but I want you all to know what I'm doing to rock a little hand on it. All those thinking of you, there's Christmas. And I'd like to give you all a special Christmas message. I'll be as a surprise. Like how about a little please let the high go on, bye. Thank you. Oh, there's more. Walk a little slam. Christmas is a time of hoot. Time of joy. A time of love and I sure would love it. Take slides that feature you got there. Okay. What will you want? No, no, no, no. Oh yeah, Christmas. Christmas to me means family. Family means friends. The friends means getting together. And getting together means eating. All right, pass me that thumbs. Stay with you, please. Walk like you. I can't remember. And I just want to say to you right now, you know, I may be a big star. Maybe too big. But ain't nobody so big. You can't reach out to help in the hand. I help in a hand. Well, would you hand me a helping those tomatoes over there, switch to believe? I'd be. I'd be very much. Now like I was playing. Ain't nobody so big. You can't just do up a friend of you know what the holiday season. Speaking of season, you won't pass me that thumbs trigger when you get a chance. Okay. Yeah, just just don't scream the color. That's right. Like I don't want to. So this Christmas, why don't you all take a tear from old animals? Now, I don't leave those steak tips right where they are. You know what I mean? I appreciate it. I want you to remember for all part of God's great big family. And you know God made man into his only match. And look in the mirror, I'd have to say God must be a big, big, simple and you know what I mean? Like you do. But I especially want you all to remember this one last thing. And you're all the home of Christmas, spring and that popcorn up on the free. Save a big big bowl for the king. Extra buttered, you know what I mean? Like you do. Like you. Like you like.
