from time when it wasn't going to be so quick with that but he just came running in here like yeah yeah idiot a 26 on Zeta for speaking of idiots here is pulse I have no idea what this magazine is do no wait wait till you hear this this is the January 19th issue for those who know what it is yesterday morning personality neo rangers it's data for Miami is ill some say it could be serious and lingering we hope rumors are not true what meanwhile though his absence allowed joie Reynolds at W. S. A. G. to make some strong and headway as the book started Reynolds with sidekick Bill Marshall never sounded better have you ever heard such crap in your life where did that come what is this magazine the pulse of brought all it's another one of those broad chasing magazines yeah can you believe that oh they never sounded better well I got news for if he never sounded better that's a hell of a commentary on his career isn't it because if you listen to him lightly man it's just like he's gone through the motions they forgot to listen to where his baggy pants anymore really no they forgot to mention you were sick in between the rooms isn't that interesting there were no ratings being taken could be serious and lingering now joie's problem is serious and lingering for about 30 years now but that's another story it's called no ratings that's like a wishful thinking swishful thinking and I can't believe this from pulse for that out of here we are talking to you in ex-year from today Ronald Reagan will be a former president thank god for that thought I will boy throw that out well if we can survive that long that's excellent news 365 days 829 on Zeta 4 let's go back to the calls and thanks to whoever put that stupid piece of crap in pulse yeah I have a lingering illness from reading that crap they've county hello hello how you doing yeah good I just want to tell you that I got called by one of these rating services last night my birch a Tom Birch I don't know who it was but it was really well because the first thing he started our same was what's your number one radio music station and without hesitation I said data for me I thought this question was kind of loaded by saying number one radio music station not that you guys don't play music but that's not what your famous work um hmm straight I let you know that also but I heard that you already mentioned as so many in the office here said you already mentioned it before but the the reason that all these women are supposedly listening to the live you awful stations is because they're piping it into their brain all day long yeah that's true yeah there's a girl in the office here we talk about talk to her she's got to turn the music down because music no that's that is a good point there and tremendous number of women of secretaries and nurses and whatever they work in offices and they have that crap piped into background of their captive audiences and I guess they feel compelled to write it down in their diaries that they're listening even though they're like passive they just happen to be there yeah I mean I think they think that that's what music is you know well I'll tell you one thing if I were an advertiser it would be a cool day in hell before I would put any by any advertising I want of those stations it's just like a background a subliminal kind of a background service yeah because nobody's paying any attention hmm you can advertising I realize the value in the American capitalist system of of advertising everything and I won't mention any names that you put on the air but I really hate loud car commercials and I have to say that's the only time my possibly change this channel is when I hear one of those but you've earned you've earned a button my car story is my land that makes you work well okay thanks a lot thank you boy boy eight thirty two unsay to four and if we've earned a button on his other thing it can't be all bad right that's good news and we all want to earn a button that's right this one here that says get a life that's my button right we have an open line in date six two oh thirty six hundred that's our date county number and of course if you live in date county that's probably the one you ought to dial all or you can always dial a brown number sure like if you're messed up in the brain like if you're a moron those are the kind of colors we love and if you're joining us in midstream our subject for the day has been brain surgery for pig me's now seriously we're talking about what our good dear friend on a.m. was discussing yesterday course he only talked about a little bit of it because he didn't want to mess up that a.m. is dead and we've already taken that as a given because you notice most of these people now a couple of mentioned Alice or whatever but very few of these people talk about a.m. because is past a it's finial easternist market dead the ED boy it went down quick to didn't it this is how quick of the 12th of October of last year it kind of died okay where are we going out to a browner county hello out of there good birdy yeah I don't know I listen to that other station shoot what is it double you shoot yeah oh boy do you really yeah get down to that funky music white boy yeah get down tonight that's case you does that really no no it isn't well he didn't get down tonight but this color doesn't know from case you from get down from anything play that funky music white boy yeah who did that Jimmy the Greek yeah well cherry wild cherry that's right pretty impressed yeah we're going to be playing that any minute right after simply red and then we'll fit together one at wild cherry and simply red that'll be magnificent work well yeah that'll be on that'll be great on god's is grill at lunchtime we can have cherries jubilee never mind never mind sir just keep rolling man you're on a real roll now what is your story hello now there is what is you want to tell us sir besides funky white boy get down wedr whatever rap crap what is he want to say I don't know how about goodbye how about good start 27 till nine on zeta four now one of the interesting things in the book now stand keeps talking about the numbers and it's it I want to tell you a stand because I know you're listening to the show either now or on tape it's embarrassing okay I mean it's one thing when the numbers come out we've always traditionally whether they're great or mediocre whatever always talked about them for the whole market and for the art own show but after the you know the tenth week it gets a little bit old you know what I'm saying well we got twenty seven thousand twenty five to fifty four man and we got you know I mean give it a rest but one of the interesting things is we were kind of like all the way across consistent right around a four which means we did better than that because that included that horrible month when we were here in October but the last hour I would have thought in the nine o'clock hour would have been comparable to what I used to do on am you understand what I'm saying because there's nothing else really going on and one has to wonder what it is between nine and ten you follow what I'm saying that should be a monster hour for the show and it's not it's not a battle but it was not the big thing that was very big as it was close but it was not a gigantic monster hour which it ought to be well don't you think it's got to be that sandy patent fact oh yeah that's true I forgot about the work against a mass competition and probably the collectibles guys been on a couple of times I was doing that book that man you can't you can't uh beat that collectibles go we can't even begin to sandy I've got a nineteen oh two toaster that's run by kerosene let's have a punch toast for sandy okay like right at a mouth well she is she is so bad you know she she to me she is the epitome of radio in this market mediocrity yeah mediocrity she is so bland and so mediocre and so boring and so repetitive and so just absolutely vanilla and that's she's the epitome of the broadcast media in this market just bland and totally useless went to central vanilla program and here's Bobby bland on zeta four Bobby blue bland right okay let's go to Broward County hello yes yeah that's what I figured how do you figure because I saw I saw on the phone line that there was a little rubber raincoat would you think of my show not not much I think you you in stand of both given no meaning of the word no show I'm thinking about flashing the Santa Rea house next what do you think well listen if you value your chicken sir I would keep it keep it at whole you want another show no enough was enough enough was enough yeah there's more to show you though but I don't want to see it's okay okay what do you mean if you know Johnny Depp's home address give us the number but that's about a good idea we have an open line in Broward seven now the guy comes up here you remember that how come for this stupid little brown car and a drove up here and a guy came running up and he opened up his raincoat and he had on like some stupid shorts and t-shirt or whatever I mean not like not undershorts but regular shorts with thank god because he was ugly and and he opened a coat and stuck his tongue out like a man ludicrous in ran back into car and a drove out then he came back in again and you know I mean what did it again did it again I think the new rule is going to be we don't want any ugly people flashing in our window okay I think it's poignant that the thing that sticks out in your mind most of all is the color of the car so that I'm going to give him a little bit that was the most memorable part of the whole situation okay does that answer your question sir that's not too good uh date county hello hey Neil yeah is he so say yeah was a Buenos dias I mean you're always star yeah much of bueno hello a show today I know really isn't it good topic you may not feel very good but it is coming through now wait what do you say man I mean I feel very good why did you say that you say you were in a funny mood today oh I'm mentally I'm physically I feel fine but mentally I'm ready for a nervous breakdown I'm just right on the the very edge right on the razor's edge of going over the brink yeah damn mentally you come in through loud and clear yeah I'm going to solve that though because I'm going to have all the phones in my house disconnected because that's where a lot of my problem is it's right I tell you what a major part of my problem not as in stand major but uh oh please no time major I listen to him yesterday well I was pretty exciting one you're right no show yep no show it all no show you they may you program director you have number one trading well I don't want to be programmed to record out of here at 10 o'clock and I like it that way I don't want to have to really work but uh they got everything else on tapes so they might as well put program director on tape and just let her roll all day and they did it to your music that's a good idea I think they ought to just put the whole station on tape the rest of the day well I tell you what after you is no more no more say that's it really well why is that well I go to super cool oh super cool yeah no way I don't listen to that either listen I pull a week ago my wife is really turned on to you now really I know it's not dangerous so I'm not absolutely safe in my hands sir I mean but listen I I I call you last year I know try the end of the year and I ask you for a special song I don't know if you don't play the song anymore but if you please do me a favorite to moral and play it what's that is the pussy song oh yeah you you play that's still what do you mean tomorrow well say she she she she can't have a radio at work she only listen to you in the morning on her way to work they mean pussy fell in the well that's one right there you go yeah we'll play that tomorrow great what time does she go to work you go is between seven

yeah sir yeah last I've listened to you for years and I switch all around on the radio here right I'm a sir wait a minute you said you switch all around yeah um has been the hour last night when him and Debbie were smoking of switch all around there mm-hmm and guess who found him I know it was his person there wasn't Jack's dirty was it oh oh hey like pretended like they didn't know what it was oh of course I know they did and I didn't know it was you because of the hang-up you know oh yeah what he has a lot of you bursting there and now this was bursting yeah probably I just took a lot of strength of force that's pretty exciting yeah so he does have a sidekick now in other words I'm correct that be yellow yeah yeah that'd be a pretty revolutionary mm-hmm yeah but I just want you to know and I can't I can't stand the phone very late okay well say goodbye oh goodbye bye okay that's actually a little a tidbit from one of our Zator Radio Spies it's 18 before nine and there's an open line in Broward 7 7 9 3600 I will say this in fact they're really aren't any open line they just are going nuts here today it's been a wild topic and you know why because these people are pissed yeah okay they're sick and tired of being turned off by these music programmers who don't know their grass from their elbows you know I saw I saw the music director smoking an elbow I'm serious it was frightening but you know to stand was not begging for calls just that's true I called in the end of the show and I said you finally got a good topic it's about times drug a nerve or something yeah and I'm delighted he had all those Herman and McQueen fans calling in all three of them I think all of them worked at GTR by the way because from that first call it was such an obvious setup oh no that was it most listeners say we do this and we do that you know when they're referring to a particular radio right and then they say oh no I don't work there I'm just a fan oh yeah just part of the fan club mm-hmm bulled us like the program director something like that what does that say caller number five goes in tight kept in mong hello hello near yes sir I'm a royal listener and I've been listening to your so uh I'm warning this morning wow and uh I want to touch upon a couple things first of all touch this um not right it's just a joke sir I understand first of all uh not too sick of for a captain Dave but voices by restaurant happens to be a staple at a or a radio no wait a minute he didn't say though he never heard of an either that was a caller who said that that was a caller yeah okay it so it happens to be a very heavily requested song I don't know the song I don't know the song I don't know their face you know I mean I'm not suggesting that I'm the uh they may even on music I don't know the record okay uh I'm maybe if I heard it I might recognize you know okay because there are those I'm all of us have records that we don't know the title or the artist but we could recognize the song yep uh next thing is what I don't understand is that when a station has pretty much a relaxed better term garbage for ratings right data yeah um right the consultant right bring someone in from another part of the country to tell you what has to be played where do you want me to give you a very frank and honest answer about that when when any radio station or television station in America brings in a consultant any of them you know what it tells me it tells me that the management doesn't know what the hell they're doing obviously I mean if you hire me to be the manager or program director and I go out and I hire a consultant then I shouldn't have been hired in the first place because the only reason I should have that job is because I have expertise in programming absolutely absolutely and because I know the market is you say I mean how the hell can somebody in Philadelphia tell us what's popular and what's going to play in Miami it's the most ridiculous thing I've heard in my life yeah they ought to tell these consultants to stick it where the mundo trying to take their contract I mean all you got to do is look at what their track record has been the only numbers that this station's had has been with us in the morning we've only been here for two months right two and a half months um so what I understand too a lot of the stuff that Zeta is doing is very very similar as a matter of fact liner for liner almost to a K Rock stood in New York really yeah friend of mine was just down from New York this is a jacket one of the FM's up there who was who is from this market and he was here for a week listen to Zeta and basically said that you guys are doing exactly what K Rock is doing well they must have some pretty crappy numbers after how it gets off they'll tell you I don't know they do because he was on he was on letterman last night at Howard said that the rest of the station is a disaster I don't know he was just kidding or it's in the twos yeah let's go for you guys that's right see the two more quick things they only wish they were in the twos um you were talking about new music in in the format and you had said that MTV you know they even have a block of new music yeah new music that they the new videos that they do when their new music hour are also in somewhat of a rotation on the program is ready to see J for child rental guidance kitchen fly whether or not their parents should be allowed to listen because boy this show is really stupid so you're home I still say that you know we have I don't know eight nine hundred CDs in this building in our library and the number of them that actually get played you could put in the thimble and have room leftover for the Chinese army and that's that's the problem we were talking before about simply red and the fact okay so they only had two hits but they were both very very good A.O.R records they fit our format perfectly and you know there's so many groups and artists who fit to that category that you'll never hear that we don't play on this station and if we would be playing them there would be less of the field columns and less of the CCR less of the John Cougar and less of the repetition and people would stick with it more well I hate to disagree with you as good as those simply red records are I don't think you could tige them all as A.O.R records I think the more A.O.R.s. I mean let me say this to you if little lies my fleet would mark and I hate to keep using that but that's one of the best examples if that's an A.O.R record and certainly money's too tight to mention is all right well if you put it down the whole concept of that record it's a counterculture it's an anti-establishment record how can it not be an A.O.R record how can it not fit maybe it just doesn't maybe I'm trying to pigeonhole it is not being rock and roll record I don't agree with you at all finally you are having trouble getting Casey the sunshine bear records yeah okay I have an original Casey the sunshine band medley with all of the hits which was done on a remix description so there's jockies if I put it on consent oh I love it okay I'll get that in the mail to you excellent thanks like I you have a great show keep it up thank you you're all by that little big great well look for that well wait we can put Casey back on the map what's wrong with that you know I said that the other day and in a couple of people got better shape did they I think so I mean yesterday what we did I guess was really revolutionary when I got three Casey records and I same it's been played almost for because I played a little bit of dancing in the street which I noticed got you excited oh boy is Richard Van Hook got his headlights on again now that was only yesterday Richard come on cut it out it's a loyal Zayt a list I know but there's such a thing as being a little too loyal okay all right what's not going to carry the way he'll be okay really sure when's that going to start okay let's say get another call in before the news those engineers man I tell you I've always had this great love hate relationship and that is a date county hello hi I'm I I'm I you're it yeah you're it I'm on today with a cold so I get a chance to listen to you longer than my morning ride the morning I got to tell you your morning ride it helps me out a lot right I got to try and sometimes and people look at me like I'm crazy because I'm laughing behind the wheel stuff like that listen um well did I miss the two of you coming down down south date or is that still coming up oh yeah that's coming up Saturday from 11 in the morning to one the birds going to be there with me in Scotland is here from 11 to one with the hooter girls and we're they're going to be a bolting on Zayt a license plates where are you oh yeah that's right at specs on the South-Axi Highway over across from the U of M specs music by red road yeah there was okay okay I know red road and Dixie okay right I don't know I bet his name is Neil but that's not what I was going to say oh well I guess I can't remember now maybe he could get a show I don't know why we could go to the cap in in slamy that's damn major song yeah the kind of revitalized that's bad don't do I don't think you make sense of the imagination a complaint about that's the first one I in other words it got to you huh yeah I was going to try to avoid turning on that song to get people to hold on to the right one I am I'm going to tell you if only played it about 500 times I don't realize that that's from thing you've kind of like finished already well yeah but so is his show so that's why we keep playing we're trying to over anything to revitalize it and understand now we chased him away we don't need we got enough pinheads here already without him yeah well you know just by accident once I told the bird that I listened to his show when you were gone and I got the tape but he was super good yeah she said she listened to the show when I was gone and she got the tape which she said okay listen have a great day I heard what she said I'm feeling okay nine minutes till nine on Zeta Fool but I appreciate you repeating my album she said tell the bird and I told the bird have an accident on 95 not the flasher again is that there's somebody in a little brown car oh please please don't do it accident on southbound 95 this morning around 47th street that's backing up traffic all the way back to 125th also an accident on this came Boulevard southbound around 11th street this morning state lottery department is promising figures today on the per capita sales since the one dollar tickets went on sale January 12 was that was that the same car by the way yeah it is so in other words they did fall but they didn't flashed

to 90 million tickets were purchased so far now California held the record of per capita sales but they say Florida has outdone it and a lot of summer people in Florida than California so we're just

nine o'clock on say the four jackson brought I'm right it's probably a little bit too hip and too popular for get today but that's we apologize I'm sorry what two popular yeah I'm not saying anything for what is it me the damn long forget this what is it you're talking to them skier hunt you're getting on my case about saying that I choose obscure songs that song was not ahead it was not ahead looking the book and I bet you it didn't break thirty no it's not a big it's a good I love the song it's a great right it's a wonderful record and I like hearing it but if I were to suggest that you wouldn't play it because you'd say it's too obscure first of all we've already played it before I love it because somebody requested not a obscure okay and never well look at it there's KC give it up bigger pardon oh and then the KC and the sunshine band okay together oh yeah and then there's KC with also see Terry Disserie mm-hmm that's right he's just multi-faceted that guy please don't go why don't you do the ID cap day while he's what am I looking for now I'm Jackson Brown why you do the ID history in the making on Zeta 4 today ladies and gentlemen we have a topic here's a real Roger show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale and the Palm Beach oh yeah it wasn't it wasn't much of a hit it only was on a charts for 12 weeks and got to number 13 that's not a hit at all isn't you idiot that's not sure I'm not impressed 12 weeks number 13 what's wrong with that if it stopped it's hot 20 man we were doing what had never played that if that girl had a request to that lawyers in love by Jackson Brown 12 weeks song and I don't know what's wrong with them again here the award I'm saying I love the song but it wasn't a big let me point something out okay no wait a minute doctor my eyes there is nobody in the in the world would say that was not a big hit okay all right wait a minute hot now this was 12 weeks on a chart how many weeks do you think doctor my eyes was on a chart nine okay and it's got to 13 how high do you think doctor my eyes got eight okay so there's only five positions difference this was four weeks longer on a chart and that and you're telling me that one was a hit and this one wasn't you idiot like I was saying I think we should play that more oh yeah you know this man honest again no wonder he doesn't play music anymore he just hangs out and I wish you'd put it away by the video lawyers and what yeah that was a heavy one thing about captain Dave he may not be right ever but at least he's consistent you know there's something to be said for consistency that's right Neil Roger yeah okay doctor five you're going to pick sowns this oh yeah and when and when you're there kicking for you please everybody who shows up at kicks lones gets the kick captain Dave right in the old posture that you never hear that song though that's I love the song what does that mean you never hear it that's the problem because word two busy plans CCR that's why you never hear it can you believe it because Peter among in there is busy programming all that garbage that we play okay so maybe marginal cuts maybe it was a hit all those Tom Penny records and haven't been recorded yet I can't believe we used to play that on gloves they never play anything like that now why you're saying love did they really play it on well that's what that's why like it so much because we used to play it on the morning show all the time I'm so worn out from him today he has just been no I've brought up some interesting things that but you refuse to talk about yeah let's back up now right let's just skip over the fact that you were totally wrong on that you were so wrong it's embarrassing okay I mean why did you just admit you know nothing about music you worked it loves all that time you know nothing about music a logna it's true that's good I played I play a corner and he got up said about that because I don't get it said I just say you know it's an okay song you don't like for an erad on you've already said that I love them hey and the late seventies and that rock station that we used to play him I used to love play and they're early what is he talking about rock station what does that mean do you understand what that means no that rock station we used to play him what what does that mean where I used to work why late seventies where at why 103 oh Jacksonville no one you didn't mention he's nobody knows what he's not that's well I didn't and nobody would care that that's almost as embarrassing you're saying that lawyers and love wasn't a hit a lot of embarrassment for one morning wouldn't just say that if you were to walk out on the street and ask somebody who did law years and love they say what you got to admit that not many people are touching them out of you said lawyers and love unless you were in a grover somewhere nine oh five on zeta four we apologize for the in temperate behavior of captain day of this morning but he's under a lot of pressure a lot of stress and you know when you've been in all of those heavy duty plays by the way we didn't mention that Prince Edward is turning artistic now it's like it comes to no great surprise but he's joined some acting group or something he's done some before but now he's getting into what heavy duty not that he's out of the closet I guess he's really yeah okay let's go back to the calls and let's say hello they got a hello are you there oh I should punch this up man I'm having a hell of a day today hello hi hi hi hi yeah hi are you doing I'm okay listen I know if you know about what's going on in 96 about the scavenger hunter not no I have no idea what's going on because I don't listen to 96 that's not for me that's a teeny Bob station I know I know but it is you knew I think it's getting right five thousand dollars so who cares it's you call me to promote another radio station I'm not interested in giving them a promo for a contest that they're running I understand that I was just kind of I had known that you had caught the key in the morning you guys were sort of friends while we are friends but I don't promote his contest if that's what you're getting at yeah okay yeah what was the point of that because while she was going to call and promote something that they do in powered 86 I mean we maybe friends but I'm not that crazy hunter you are your guard but she held on for a while that's good well I would too if I was going to get a free plug what does that say collar newer five okay rower hello yeah that's I'm guest on the show no thanks I'm late now okay get lost believe that that that was him again you believe it boy did I make the right decision or what yeah I told you I could tell you was a jerk and I was my decision yeah just okay I could have gone the audience was different it was overwhelming they wanted him on the show so was your incision absolutely they'd county hello hello yeah morning yeah what are you doing have a go I wanted to bring up a couple things if I'm me okay I don't want to touch anything I don't know they can get into the door touch of things in any case I want to ask you who's the people that you rocked to you oh that's um now that was a Marlon Bailey put that to that Marlon Bailey did not put that together that's so co you're you're you're filtered Joe and a fish it's not Marlon Bailey oh it isn't run a runaway due run around I'm sorry I'm thinking of the wrong I'm thinking of the wrong cut yeah the wrong due yeah I'm thinking of the wrong due in my head let me ask you a question I went down to blue note the other day and picked up a lonely granicorn yeah you do the cure that also the cure probably yeah you're filled to Joe and a fish it's called kosher club is a group yeah they probably got it all right I wanted to also bring up what Captain Dave was talking about before a class tower about um tell mentality in the you know I'm not a I'm not a radio expert or anything like that I'm just your you know basic ordinary disposable income but I'm wondering now like the listening you all as you do stuff different you're not the um the typical radio station the place is same ten songs and just rotate them and so forth yeah with a read plastic with you as you do stuff different and it's interesting I'm going to get bored with the with what you're playing why do you think they um you know if it's if they try something if they're out the market they try something different like that they may have they may lose some of their their uh listenership because you know the typical average consumer is basically a robot you can't afford to do it sir we want you know we're that all morning law you can't afford to be esoteric uh being an artistic success doesn't make it there's just too much money at stake do you think though that the draw that they could have and being in doing things differently making things interesting instead of the same repetitious uh playlist if you want to call it that wouldn't you say that that could bring a bring a live some of the markets around no they just they wouldn't want to put the dollar on the line no that's the same that's the same oh because people don't buy the music they buy ratings they buy audience in other everybody you're advertising you want to reach a large mass audience you don't want to reach some narrow suit uh you know group of people who claim to be you know a whole year the now or more intelligent or have better taste than they don't care about that they want to reach a massive audience god will we dollar well well that's what the business is about this is the charity where it's a commercial enterprise that's we're I'm not trying to just be with you saying anything like that it's just that um and the problem is we've got just too many people who want and especially on a station like this there the the young male audience man they want uh you know like I said before I have a metal and they want all these other uh marginal groups and and you can't build an audience that way it's a tune out 95% of the audience is going to tune all that stuff out they don't want to hear it you think it's uh what are they looking for they looking for an active listener or they looking for someone who's just going to click on the radio in the background and just on the air on the advertisers viewpoint just on the off chance that they're going to that the listener would pick up their their spot on the radio or they want somebody who's going to be active we listening to the program like I don't know how your your rate structure is set up but I wouldn't surprise me if you were to tell me that the rate on your show might be higher than anything else you know during the day they are but that's it's a morning drive show first of all right secondly this show has higher ratings and a rest of the station too that's it that's my point you know you're you keep things interesting you keep things on the ball you're not just playing the same basic stuff over and over again you're not a boring talk that's a problem with if that's a problem with FM it's a jookbox and it has been for years there are hardly any people in this business who got the balls to put somebody on to do something different I don't know if I'm the average analyst or not I'm 23 and I have I just both a boy and come and the only thing I really listen to on the radio is either you were stand now stand is fairly repetitive but at least he does come up with some different uh different things over and out and that I don't listen to anything else in the market except for you and stand every no no I'll put on Bruce Williams but I know how you feel about that all the story all together end of the world um good captain David Chad why didn't you why didn't you want to bring that up on the air bring one up well you when he was saying about how the um they have a business in general not but because that's a different subject and has got nothing that you know we could spend another show on it about new artists and about you know how they don't get a chance that's fine and there's probably a trip there is a tremendous amount of truth of that but it's got nothing to do with what we're talking about it really doesn't right well you know when we have to pin your nose so give the guy a break he's doing all right he's doing great but he's just you know wrong that's all see you later all right bye bye so 11 after not I mean it wouldn't not like we have some kind of a feud going here just that he's full of it and he knows it he's wrong where but he just likes to be an agitated that's his whole role on the show he doesn't just to go out and check the thermostat and turn on the air conditioning he'd lot of fruit hey guys what's going on we've been ripping the daylight sottie you we told everybody to give you a kick tonight at uh the Mary-out lounge okay that's a Cyprus Creek Mary-out between six and a get your kicks on route whatever it okay let's go to line three but we have to come up with a long closing song because I am worn out man this has been such an intervening draining session today you know but anything you got there now we're not gonna then we'd have to play it in here all right yes we can give it to him I mean no yellow an orthodox yellow that's probably a little bit too um what what would you say I'd be great idea yellow mr blue sky oh not mr blue sky you'd like to that song I don't give a damn who like that we're not playing mr blue sky there are no times on this one which I just can't believe I think that when they don't do that and that's not I was gonna play all that again but I'm not gonna do it because he'll get very upset if I play like a we talk about the thing you you're you're you're you're I'm putting verbi it should you won't get upset you won't get upset is he gonna get upset no I get that on that's your wrong cut yeah how about can't get it out of my head by ELO that was a hit and that's a beautiful song I like that what is it can't get it I think you do you want to my head by the letter man yeah speaking of David Letterman by the way Howard really suck last night on the David Letterman show he was so bad 1913 on Zeta 4猛 excuse I guess we heard the audience in Apollumji. Right Gonser said that lawyers in love was all distorted on the year, which I don't understand why because there was nothing out of the ordinary going on in here. Not in here either. So what can I say? Goes to show you, we had nobody's just playing that right? Some marginal record. That was the center distorted? It didn't, my car. Oh, that's your car. Nothing else did. Huh?
