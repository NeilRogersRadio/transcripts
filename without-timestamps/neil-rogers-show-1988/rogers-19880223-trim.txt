I'm telling you it's so... I'm getting your bad dad. Thank you. Bye. Oh my god. You know, if you're reading the hair, well, you know, it must be true, right? I hope she forgave me. We have the data edition. How come we don't get a brown edition? Wasn't my fault. See if I subscribed to it, I could bring it in from the house in the morning. Sorry. There's an idea. Hmm. Sorry. I just said it was an idea, and said it was a good one. Ha ha. I'm gonna get the hair old. Is this man out of his mind? Yo, J. I'm gonna get the hair old. All right. Yeah. Okay, now let me ask you a question, okay? Yes, sir. Yes. Yes, sir. If you were writing that news story for AP, would you have written the last sentence quite the same way? Well, well, you know, it depends on the circumstances, you know, maybe police said, put it out that they just wanted to talk to this kid, you know? Maybe she's reflecting the police attitude. Right. Yeah. They just thought it might be a little curious. Well, yeah, they can't accuse me, I'd say. More than I'm getting trouble. Let's see, that's probably a very small town. And police are different in small towns than they are in major cities. What? What? Big man! Ha ha. No one had me. Yeah. Anyway. Yeah, anyway. Now, what if it was loosely Cooper that wrote that review? I want to. Because Linda Cicero does the budget. The budget restaurants were there out in loosely Cooper who used to be a guest in my show until Alice until I put her on a payroll over there. I started paying their guests. Yeah. But at any rate, she must have done that. Because she does braward. Lucy does braward. You've seen that flick. I'm sure. Couple times. And I got news for it. If Lucy Cooper really believes that this is a three-star throttarilla, she calls it boy. There's only one thing I can say to you, Lucy. You'll be happy. You'll be happy. You'll be happy. OK. If I knew that was going to be good. Yeah. Well, I'll see. I went through all that trouble. I might as well use it for something. 23 after not on Zeta 4 will be back. Right after these impolton words. OK. It's 26 past six or nine or 10 or 11. Isn't that something? I really thought it was 26 after six. I had no idea. But the day of the week it is, what month? What year? Well, it's been that kind of morning. And if you missed the 7.30 day to clock half hour, so did we. OK. Because we were knocked off the air because the AM here with their new wood, BS, whatever it is, with their new power search power trip. Power trip. I think power search would be a word for listener search. They have stole our juice. OK. And they overloaded in the circuits with their new one-tower thing with their non-directional crap. And they knocked the whole building off the air. OK? Well, there wasn't a wee room with an early and raw back then of the transmitter. And hit it with a right cheek. And that's it's possible. That could be true too. So I shouldn't play off. I'm... Yeah, you were in hysterics. Why do it's true? I wasn't hysterics. Thank God she's on the air. And she didn't can't hear the show. Who cares? It's true. If you'd like to hear the news from Mount Rushmore ladies and gentlemen, tune to 940 on your AM dial. OK. We got a caller from Pontiac Michigan on a line. Hello. I'm on the other side. Are you doing? Great. Just one what you know you do have a Michigan fan's out here. From Pontiac, huh? Yeah, I was born in Pontiac. What did you do live in the Silver Dome? No, we lived for a while there and it moved battlecree to an Indian thing. Battlecreech! Yeah. All right. What a great town ed is. The most famous place in Battlecreech is the railroad tracks. Am I right? Yeah, I know. Yeah, I know. And Detroit's always been the most hadn't seen you missing. It's not about it. Well, that's because the rest of what? You know, I lived in Kalamazoo for two years. That's not a bad town. In there. You've never been to Kalamazoo. It's a pretty good town. Isn't it right next to Grand Rapids? I mean, that battlecreech. It's right next to Battlecreech. What I never there? No. We always went to the lake. We had to gun lake. Oh, yeah, gun lake. I know it very well. Yeah, you stay by our troops. How?

First, 16 on the next next guy's show. A lot of the commercials that you guys missed in the half out of your down. Yeah, that's an idea. Well, I will think about it. Just want to call. I just know. I like you, sir. Oh, thank you. Did you ever eat at least? Did you ever eat a loose finder, Delhi, and Detroit? No. No. I can say it. I may have been in the Detroit. I've got a couple times with buddies and school. Yeah. I'm 30 years old. I don't remember much of it. Well, believe me, you're better off for it. OK, have a great weekend. Thank you. Bye-bye. 929 on Zeta 4 that he arrived to show, World What's his name? Gonser will be a long attend. I know he won't attend 10. Mm-hmm. That's correct.
