Because it's like, oh, I said he's so lucky with him. Yeah. I know, you know, when you tell me stuff like this, it just makes me so glad I'm away from that kind of radio.

And the other things, they just, you know, are fine. And yet we know that there are things in there. And they just, they're just, they don't hear it. But where they don't get it. Well, finally they got it. It's a long time. And you can't find it. Can't find it. Can't find it. Can't find it. You don't have to do it. I've been to you for two spanks. Ma'am. You've won this side.

I'm a Billy. Don't need help. And you're not just asking me. We ain't hurt. You want me. You want me? Whatever you did, don't drag me into it. Sure, okay. Whatever you say about. Hello, Dave. What do you want? I know what you don't miss can feel. If we were to get our hands under her mansion, then it'd be so black and blue so they would have walked for a week. Just between us, man. I fit the clean, will you please? Well, they really wrote your brother's fault. They didn't, too. Well, that's like those. Well, Dave, you've been told time when time again. Not to touch walley's things, haven't you? All right, all the red over again. But I think the first thing you should do is to tell you a brother outside you have it, it's all the things. For what? You don't know what you're sorry. Sorry about the stools, man, okay? And that's okay. I'm switching to troll-based. You're a star. Anyway, it's not real goal. I'm talking about it. And it's straight. I'm going to have to go in the long time. Blow that skirt. I'll do it. Hold on a second. Hello? Hello, here it's Ed. I don't know what to do. Still a little proxerid. There's a little proxerid. I've been taking you. I've been touching myself. Dave, don't touch me. I love you, Todd. He's done it again, Dave. Listen to Ed. Ed? Oh. Well, I have to back home yesterday. Yeah, yeah, I had to put John Hofer Ed. You understand. Oh, sure. I do. That's fine. Back to follow. It is. And then how are you? Possibly going to follow that. I have three unrelated things to bring out. At least I think they're unrelated. I hear it in the middle of my sleep this morning. That Jeff Charles was heard on another radio station. Don't interfere with his clothes off. Yes, sir. The disgusting thing I got. Yes, sir. I'm trying to be outrageous and saying it. Yeah. I'm trying to follow the dog he goes to bed. I like it. Yeah, because he's kind of like the ghost. He kind of drips slowly north here. Kind of like Joey rattled it. You know, there's a big difference between being outrageous and trying to be outrageous. He is. I mean, he's such an irresponsible idiot that I just. I mean, I got so sick of his program about. I was glad to see if we need to. Me too. I wouldn't dare tell you what they're paying him over there. You're probably crying. Just out. I know you guys don't want to get up. So what do we have to do? But have any of you checked in with this Republican convention? I've been watching, you know, some of the early, like on CNN. Yeah. I've not some of it yesterday. Have you ever seen unpopular plus two people with you? I don't know. I just didn't want to say that because it sounds like I'm shilling for the democrat. But I have really, really been having always loved. It's true. And you want to want to a group that always show up at it? Yeah. And you know what? I was, I think it was Channel 2 or something late Saturday night. I just accidentally tuned into a, they were showing the Republican convention from 64 when Goldwater was given his acceptance speech. Yeah. And they'd show the audience and all these Republicans are so damn ugly. I'm very candid. I don't know what it is. I can be a connection there. I need to insist, you can't block to any other group you become Republican. Yeah. I'm sorry. Did you say that because I was just thinking of that right before you said that? Yeah. I think it would concern me, though, this quail, this piece of bush has made a perception to these white wings fundamentalist radical. Oh, right. Yeah. They invite very foul and Pat Robertsons into the convention, all you know, someone's going to say. Yeah. Pat Robertson last night with us, talk about the family, the value, that is, and what you go on back at school and prayer. Yeah. But you know, quail is one of the few, I think, looking people they have. So that's, I sure like what fire says he looks cute. So that's what I mean. Yeah. That's why they, you know, they do a nice job this week. Thanks a lot. And, uh, we have to do it. We have to do this part because I still have to let her live. Well, uh, she got a little, uh, what did the only thing over the, over the deep end without feeling, these really, uh, the Thor play misty for me type letters and, fun when he realized it might not be a good idea to mention her anymore. And then imagine, we're just trying to have a little fun with her. Yeah. I feel like the lady who's going to give us a shot. We never heard from her again, either. And what happened to you? This is the beat of the characters of their way to grow into the, into their fireplace. Oh, you bet. Oh, yeah. I, I don't even miss her. Well, you guys did a great job this week. Thanks. See you later. Bye-bye. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Fuck. No. No. Oh. You dropped it! It's like a huge pie. It's pretty good. Yeah, we're sort of like cleaning up. You're lucky guys. Very nice words. Thank you. You're lucky. I thought it might want to land a little bit. I wonder the same thing. I think that's true. You really think that's true. You're lucky. What I find interesting is that if your obnoxious back to them, that's like fine. But if you're not, then they look at that as like a weakness. You're not as pretty damn good. That's right. You're the one who's most of the people in the street. You have money, but the society is so fast-paced. That you're expecting everything immediately. You're waiting on mine. Everything has to happen immediately. You're so when they come down a flower or any other area in the country. It's easy to spot them because they're bringing still, you know, if they're on the right. But yeah, but if body is on how and they'll be, you're probably on the right. Yeah, they don't, it's much just, it is slower down here. It's a slower pace. If I can't get up down here, we're here in a half. If I didn't get out of New York, when I did, I probably would have backed up. Yeah, understand that and the weather's your better. You know, how hot it is up there this summer. It's miserable. I know this when you're talking about the OTS, but the kind of road ahead because most people do. I mean, there's a lot of beautiful things going on. Of course. New York City is unique and there's only one New York City. The world, of course, New York is from Rochester, you know. So he really knows. I hate one less than a one-cin I'll let you go. I only hate this one city because my wife's in a quite dry. And if you can't get it, I know it will be deal, but if you haven't around, I hate that. I hate that, like you played about on how and you'll be sure that we're supposed to be something in the OTS that they were about to play it and now it's a bit weird and something. We're about to, uh, hold the hell of it. And we for both of us to be one of the hardest things that ever could come out as a, it's really good. Yeah. So if you have that away at him, once you guess, and you might want to play it, it's not a lovely guy. I'd love you guys anyway, you're beautiful. I'm going to put it first here. I'll see if I can find it. Have a nice day. Bye bye. 7-2. Coral Springs. Hi. Good morning, guys. Oh, it's wondering, Captain D. Could you tell us, friend, might you need to work at McDonald's and Coral Springs to go to hell? Ha ha. Burn, baby. Ah. And, here's him, burgers. Ha ha. And also, um, New York's, uh, hanging on the motivation station. I didn't listen to your task at the moment. Uh huh. Make it to me so many of you, that just, uh huh, do you know? You know, I like that station every now and again for a few minutes. I like it. I like it. Yeah, I do too. In small doses because it's so positive. And I like positive. I'm a positive type of person. Yeah, I'm positive sometimes. Sure. And, uh, I enjoy it. But only like in little small doses, you know? I'm just going to read the sweet to be. Yeah, there you go. Perfect. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Thanks for calling. Thank you. There's nothing but negative. Well, we call it this call up in the stream of the, uh, W, B, you out. You know, down here, it could be the biggest thing in the history of South Florida. How about you, B, M, R, bummer, ready? Yeah. Now, what do you think of the motivation station, John? What are you thinking of? Oh, come on. I like it. Once in a while, they'll play a tape that's really corny. It's like, why did they play that? And there's some of the people that they play are like really together. People that have some good things to do with things. One, two, three. I say that. They don't say it's great. You have a, how are we being yourself? But they're rating them. This will, I mean, let's be real. They really are. Well, we are. We do have a Neil story for you now. Now, you want to preface this captain there? This was when you were on vacation and Brad was in here. I've never heard it. And I wish I had the whole thing with this like about 70 seconds. It was this lady called up and she was talking about how much she hated New Yorkers and the New York Mets and she said on the New York Mets team. It's nothing but a bunch of greasy Puerto Ricans. I see. Now, this is, this is going to give the lady a story that we promised her. And also, we've been in with our phone call that we had a few minutes. So, when she said greasy Puerto Ricans, he hung up on her and he had this to say. Now to send you back to New York, honey, and make you into a new subway. Wow. What a kill. A lot of disgusting piece of crap you are, honey. All those greasy Puerto Ricans, man. I hope they trace that call lady and what you and all. We're going to have the people at the Santa Rea house, but a voodoo spell on you on it. Yeah, big ugly, yeah. Exactly. A horsey motor. And you'll wake up on Sunday morning and you'll be a Milano, how's that? I think that's it. It's the best of both worlds for you, honey. Just fusting subhuman, treating douchebag. You know, all these people from New York that think they're so swath and so sophisticated, so much better. And all their culture, yeah, their culture is all done in there in the subway with the burning gants, okay? That's their culture right there. Thank God, we live in a civilized town when people should each other, they say, I'm sorry. What a kind of a place to come from anyway. The garbage of the streets. I think they ought to make them use plantation bags in the York. I would share them right, okay? Then you'd see some garbage. Now, there's more of that? There was more of that was what the... Yeah, we edited it down. That was pretty much the green of it. This is for all you New Yorkers to make you feel at home. Yeah, sort of make a feel at home this morning. Okay. Can you maybe take a call or two because I'm not ready for that? Well, maybe. Is that right to read a couple of them to you if I can? No, let's see what... Or at least one. Okay. Okay, Bonnie University Professor Rindholberg's recent study revealed that 55% of German men and 30% of German women fail to change their underwear on a daily basis. What? I'm scared of 44% and 6% respectively of French men and women. That I mean, I've never dreamed of such a thing. Maybe we can get one of those people to call in. You know how you get the news coming to you rather than you go into the news. I guess it's the way you're brought up, don't you think Paul? Well, could be. Here's another one from Fort Pierce. Okay.

Well, mine's a national inquiry. Well, it's along the same lines. But new times is a interesting story, isn't it? There's one more here in the youth. Now I think you guys did this in the news, so I think I can say this. And if I can't you can dump it out. Okay. It has one of the sexual organs in it. All right. It's in a scientific way.
