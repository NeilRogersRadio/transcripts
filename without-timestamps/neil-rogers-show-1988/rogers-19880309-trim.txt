Let's go to the house. How are you? Really? Hey! Let's get it out. Please. Get it out. See. 777-8BC. Okay, it's a 25-57-UndW ABC. I'm our boss, Grandiessen. Hello again. Here's my best to you. Here's the weather herb. Oh, thanks. Okay. Now it's a traffic out there. Long Island Expressway. Anyway, we know that Despring and Back Allows Great Memories for both of our New Yorkers, not Walking the Doorks. See, we have a lot of New Yorkers here, but they don't get a chance to listen to the show because they spend all morning Walking your Doorknob. Trying to find just the right spot. You may have people down here that you still live on Long Island. Hmm? They're not from New York. It's only if you're from Fire Island that you're from New York. Okay, let's go to Fort Laterdale. Boy, what a sad day it is in the big city over there. Hello. Yes, sir. Pretty good. I see it's still got skin head for mayor over there. Oh, yeah. At around 10, got a top as you can. Yep, let's go. Liberal voters aren't there, and all the old guys. You don't want to keep the old guy in. Liberal voters for Bob Cox get serious. They all had, and they all had arm bands on the ones that I saw voting for cops. Okay, but I like your show. They were humming Deutsche Landu Barala's race quietly. You got a great show. I know that. But I'm a police officer down here. Oh, God. Not in Fort Laterdale. No, in the county. Okay. You mean for the sheriff for that fascist picnic Navarro? All right. Come on. Don't be talking like that about me. Okay. I won't say the truth. All right. For that great guy, Nick Navarro, right? That great defender of the Constitution. Yeah. Who believes in personal freedoms and liberties and live and let live? Yeah. You got it. All right. I like you, Joe. Thank you. Okay. See you later. He's still a fascist pig. It's a 27 past seven. Oh, he is. Am I going to lie about it? I mean, in Broward County, like I said, they got more brown shirts there than any place else since Nazi Germany. And any of the kids that are thinking to come in here for spring break, you better call them immediately. Get on the phone if you don't anybody. We're thinking to come into Laterdale, tell them to stay where they are. They're going to get busted. They just come here here. They breathe. They're going to get busted. But they might be here looking for a job. Yeah. They're a big job fair. Yeah. I know that when I was in college, man, all the kids when they got a spring break day. That's what the main thing that we're concerned about is when they're like a job fair. Putting out a three-piece suit. Even the girls used to put on three-piece suits. I think that disease is creeping to this part of the building. I think their filtering stand major disease through the vents in my building. I'm cereal. Oh, don't even kid. Don't joke about that. 7207 on say to four and our next call is a mobile this morning. Hello. Morning. How are you, sir? I'm okay. Where are you going? Where you'll be this morning. Oh, my mind off the assessment. 107, 7, 7, 7, 7, 8. Oh, God. Good luck to you. Thank you. He's been through this and just call a friend of mine a pathetic douchebag. Okay, now what's his name? Oh, Scott isn't pathetic douchebag. I got no Scott. Scott is a subhuman douchebag. Okay, you guys got great to know. Scott is Scott is moving long. Okay, that's what Scott is. Thank you very much. Okay, my friend. I'm feeling like I went beyond the college duty. Speaking of Scott, whatever happened to Scott from Brown, technical, you know who I'm talking about. I was working in that bill. And I come way never heard from him again. I love this show. He's a group, a groupie. I can't answer your question. What happened to him? Boy, he'd like disappeared. I never saw him again. I wanted to say him coming on a show. He wants to be in this business. He isn't this business. He's working on some little two-watt station up in the bell. That's the way he have to start. I lost track of him. He was working over. He knew he lost track of him. That's part of your job is keeping track of our good friends out there. Uh huh. Well, I failed. Good work. Bird strikes again ladies and gentlemen. Okay, well moving right along, I just can't believe. It's like Wednesday and it feels like it's Friday for sure. Feels like we put in a long hard week here. Well, and let me mention again, if there's anybody listening who knows anyone in our promotions department, we certainly need that photographer out here this week. Because the Richard Marks concert out at the Metro Zoo, to benefit MDA is a week from this Sunday. It's the 20th. He's ready to come out here, but he needs to go in there. Oh, he needs somebody to come. Well, why don't you just tell him, let's us set it up and we'll have him come out. If you wait for them when he charges somebody, they're going to say, why did you have let me tell you something? They forget about it. Don't be a whos. Would you please just have the guy come out of here? And if they don't want to pay for it, we'll take it out of Dennis Fulger's paycheck. Well, he was supposed to come here tomorrow. You know how that is when they make the duckants from your paycheck, right? Tomorrow. You can relate to that. Can't you captain day? That's why I'm talking so much to this. Yeah, exactly. He's getting paid 70 cents a week today. I spoke to Gary Lawrence about that yesterday. I said, you better take care of captain day. Oh, thanks. And he said, take care of this. Seriously, I did. I said, leave better straighten yourself out. Would you please? And he said, I've been trying, but would not much success. Now, what did you say about tomorrow? He was when we started out here tomorrow. Haven't come out tomorrow. Well, it might be too late now because he has the other things to do. Well, how about Friday? I'll call him and send you. And he'll bring his stuff out here. Oh, it's stuff. Oh, no, no, no. We want pictures taken. Dave's, we're not one of those friends of yours with a little suitcase and a Satchel, okay, that's not what we're looking for, all right? Guys, he takes pictures of a lot of famous people. He's already doing it. Yeah. For example. Divine. 730 on Zeta 4. Now, why was there that pregnant pause like that, okay? I said, I was that in portase? Well, no, but I didn't know how to come back from the enemy. What can I say about that? I'm going to miss Joe. Yeah, I'm going to miss device. I do not want to be buried in a piano cage. I'll tell you that. I really don't. Divine's portrayal of Jackie Kennedy was one of the best in the movie. What was it called? Eat your makeup? Yes, it was. It was a matter of fact. A cult classic. Yes, it's probably in a place like the Grove Stinema. Exactly. Right. That's why they show those cult classics. Exactly. It doesn't have to be old to be a classic. The Grove Stinema boys and girls. It does help if it's the gods must be crazy. Because then it shows for like two years in a row every day. Did you see the red pony by William Fock? Oh, sure. Yeah. That was a three time. I think that was a cult classic. Yeah. You believe this man? I'm Tonyo. He's ever since we had that one day where he, you know what I was laughing at. Okay, let's not Cooper City. Or is this just some guy named Cooper? Hello, Cooper. Yeah, who's this? Oh, how you doing? Pretty good. Who is this? Let me say it again. Who's this? I'm in his Michael Laramie. No, I didn't need your last name Michael Laramie, but that's okay. Is that isn't like Laramie Wyoming? Can you tell me the other thing? Yeah, probably. Yeah. So how you doing this morning? Can you imagine if you were named after Laramie Wyoming, you'd probably be one of the most boring people in a history of mankind, wouldn't you? Why is that a bat town? Oh, why have you ever been in Wyoming? Oh, don't do it. Please, don't do it. I never even heard of anyone coming from Wyoming. Nobody does. Two people drive through it every now and then when they break down, they kind of like move in there. Like into Casper Wyoming? All the friendly city. Mm-hmm. As in the friendly ghost. Mm-hmm. So what's up this morning? Whatever your name was, Mike? I was just thinking about the poll just today. I brought it for the caucus because there's no one else to vote for. Yeah, that's exactly why most people voted for him right. I agree with that. I think they should have a wider field to some other people running. There's, you know, at least that are a lot to vote. Yeah. That Jesse Jackson and, uh, a rapist. Oh. Oh. Do you imagine if those kids were like kids president and vice president? Yeah, I don't think they're either one of them has a prayer. Haha. But you never know. I agree. But the world with the world's coming to I don't know. I know it's really pathetic isn't it? I'm supposed to get on here and the line of the public and try to get them all whipped up and excited. You got to get out there and do your civic, though. I mean, it's tragic. I can see why people get turned off from this. I could have met Beverly Phillips running around with grandma. I mean, you have a prayer line or something. Yeah. I think that the whole world needs a prayer line to be honest with you. If you know what I mean, Mike? Mike, can I ask you my ask your question? Are we keeping you up this morning? I just woke up actually with a, um, I'm fine. I'm like, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I tried for me to wake up in the morning. Yeah, I don't have to go to work. I'll 10. It's hard for you in the morning, Mike. Yeah. Usually. Oh, God. Why don't you don't want to hear about that. Okay. It's disgusting. Now listen. What do you do? I do construction work. Do you? Yeah. What are you erecting this week? Right now. What is it? It's an office building site in gravy right off 100. Oh, great. Yeah. One of my favorite cities, David. I love it. Yeah. To touch up, someone's got to do it. Right. Listen, good luck with that new erection, Mike. And have a great day. Ha ha ha. See you later, Mike. Okay. Yes. Oh, why, I think we, uh, we got them flatfooted there. And wait. Nice reaction. Yeah. 734 on Zeta 4. But the line, but we just hung up is already flashing. Man, you think we were doing bioreathems here. Wouldn't you? Doesn't that attest to the popularity of this show that you can't even get in on this Damn show. That's right. Unlike some of those AM shows on those dying stations. So I guess we're going to take care of the pictures and to help with it. I guess we got to start fixing the equipment here tonight. I guess so. I guess it's a shame. And stuff like that. Some else I got to do. Oh, like, get USA today. I guess I'm going to have to pick her up. I think it's kind of like our own show. I think so. I think we're all totally independent contractors. Basically it's our own station. What I like that. Yeah. I like that too. In fact, I'm going to start making some changes on it immediately. For example, Gondra's grilled a day. What's scheduled to have heart, the grateful dead and credence clear water revival. I think all three of them can go together with a tiny bull man. Do we have KC? See, a lot of those washed out hippies from the 60s. I was supposed to say that about the dead. You know, the dead is supposedly where it's at. And that's because most of them can relate to it. Because they're brain dead. 735 on Zeta 4. It's time for another one of our world famous breaks. I thought we just like took one. Didn't we? No. Are you serious? The show is moving that fast. Flying. Just like lightning and Luke Christie, you'll join us right after this on Zeta 4. Okay. I certainly will. It's at 22 before 8 on Zeta 4. And let me take a look. Now is Mayor Galadie still on the line. Captain Dave. Is she still on the line? Hang up. She hung up. Okay. She thinks that it's where it goes. There are two minutes. Okay. That's where it is, Miss Mayor. It's 21 before the hour. It got two open lines in Broward. People keep flipping off here this morning. Very unusual in Broward, by the way. They usually don't do that to a 7, 7, 9, 30, 600. I know. They don't have anything else to do. Yeah. Here's a little suggestion for them. From those fascist pigs. Before you break the law. Like Nick Navarro. Oh yeah. The Supreme Court of the United States is now in session. Just a sender day on a with this opinion. Baby, baby, I'm aware of what you do. Be happy, be at the door. Now we're telling you what's wrong for Brian. It beats night when you turn out the light. So next time you hug me to the set. Make sure you stay on your bed. Turn on the road. Watch you. Don't turn off. So we're here to see you. Stop. Just stop making up. Before you break the law. We've got its name to three. You have no privacy. Don't turn over. Don't turn over. I look so not want to scare you. Your French Canadians, but we do have several body hounders from homestead and parign who are on foot, but is matter of fact. And you pick up trucks also, I guess, under way to the date, Brower line. And we don't want to scare anybody. But if you leave now, it about five miles an hour. You may be able to head them off at the pace. OK. Heading do north. OK. Take all your French Canadians' scumbrains with you. All right. 741 on Zeta 4. And our next call is from Fort Lauderdale. Maybe this is Mayor Cox. Hello. Oh, now. How you doing? Hi. This is Scott from MSU. What I was great wasn't it? How is that, Mia? How is good Scott? Is that what they taught you up there? Yeah, just a little bit. Yeah, that's about all you can learn up there and eat leans. I call to give you a hockey report. Oh, great. This is the biggest part of the game. This is the biggest part of the game. It's great. This is the biggest part of the game. OK. Let's hear it for this. This is certainly a big year for all the athletic supporters at MSU. Isn't it? It's true. Wow. Hey, I was punching the button the other day. I was listening to Patty Murray before she acted at it to a clock. And what did Patty say? He was talking about her trip down to the keys of path. We can't answer you slip and said she started to meet Captain Dave. Then she stopped right in the middle of sentence. They're talking about some other Taylor. Oh, that's funny. That must have been a Freudian slip. And the rumor is that Patty wears a Freudian slip too. It's puce. Is there any room with two of the Captain Dave's been Fratinizing with Patty? I don't know, but he mentioned something about her the other day. I know it. I tied the two together. Well, I think that would be exciting. Really? Yeah. I can conjure that up in my mind. I can see them tied like back to back. Have a good day, Neil. Okay, you too. I think so. Yeah, there he goes. The non-on-on-on. Okay, 742 on Zeta 4. We're going to be talking about Michigan for two hours today. Oh, good. We're going to start at Skipper's table in, uh, let's say, in Lavolnia, Michigan and head for a school cracked in the middle belt to Wolverine harness raceway. Oh, maybe how he can call? How he? Yeah, I remember how he? He always calls in rimminess. Oh, he's about to lose finder delicates. Didn't I cut him off the other day? Yeah, I think. Oh, have I really, how he? How he? How he have a problem? Yeah, I noticed. He'd be, uh, illin. By the way, now I got to bring something up. I far be it for me to dictate other people's tastes. Okay, all the way do have exquisite taste in music and in, uh, people in cuisine and in cuisine. But anyway, uh, we were speaking of cuisine. It's funny to mention that because we were at the drive through a Wendy's last night. And you can't have much better taste. Well, it's, uh, you know, one of those quicky deals. And, uh, as we were waiting for the food. Now, this was on Devi Boulevard, okay? In beautiful Devi. Not really in Devi. It's for a lot of them. And anyway, uh, sitting there and they had the radio blasting. You could just visualize the big ghetto blast, too. That was in there. And of course, it was on EDR. Mm. And it were playing at scratch stuff. Mm-hmm. How to help in anybody listening to that. I mean, it's so loud and just scratchy and puky and noise and mong and, God, almighty. It's just like any other music you have to take it by each individual song. Some of its terror. It all sounds the same. Uh, the same. Uh, the same. Yeah. Oh, that's the three this week with a bullet, by the way. Oh, that's the one they were playing. And it's number three with a bullet, an overtone, okay? Uh-huh. Yeah. Ah-ha-ha. Ah-ha. As they were for his station on the radio, they're the only game in town with a home and show. The one who says man, style and then they go point, style and then they go point, style and then they go point, style and then they go point, style. Who that doesn't have that sound, you know, that, like, opening your zippers into the background, Your hands. So if I wish you had done it, you would take it down the other day, you would go, You can use it in your oven, your oven, your other jobs and stick them way down in your furnace sauce. Stick them way down in your furnace sauce. So thank you, Zayther. Thank you Neil, till the cabin in the bird and the horn's living. As far as I've returned, you can have the rest without found your rodents. I found the best. I found the rodents. I found the best. You ate it, they had none left. They were salty. For four dollars. Why does your watch keep beeping? Because the reason for that? I've rid of that. You screwed your watch up. The wine, oh, who can fix it for you? It'd be an expert in it. You know who he is. You know who he is. That's off the exact time now. 745, exactly on Zayther 4, I'll give her take a couple of minutes. We've got this one too. This home may one. That's it. That's it. That's it. The new rod you show. The harder half. And hold it. Hold it. Break up that baby. No. You can't. You can't. You can't. You can't. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. Okay, now speaking of Ellen, if we got a great mob next time, though the bird's going to go nuts over this call. Hello. Is he gone? What a shame. Man, since people this morning are so impatient, it was a global caller from Michigan. Oh, I'm really upset. Yeah. Probably calling from the Southfield Expressway. Yeah, you hopefully to reminisce. You know, and exactly they all those names. Talk about Dick Burton and JP McCarthy and Bud guest. And what is it? The John Lodge Expressway or John Lodge Expressway. Very good. The Edsel Ford Expressway. Yeah. That's that one. Mm-hmm. In fact, they have I 75 is up there. And if you get an I 75 here, if it was completed, which is not. But if you got on there right now, you started heading north. You'd wind up and Detroit eventually. Sooner or later. Another signing that I started to keep in mind is you started right now and followed. If you followed a Caravan or French Canadians, by July of 2023, you should open Detroit. Or what? You should open Detroit. Or what? You should be left of it. Anyway, I guess so that's disappointing. Miami Lakes. Hello. Hi. How are you? Great. How are you? Hi. Good. I'm so listening to you for that too much now. And my friend Carol turned me out to your show. Hi, Carol. You had a Carol in September 5. Isn't it? I thought you was in Carol City. Oh, God forbid. Mm-hmm. Anyway. That's what we always say. Great. And I wanted to tell you we know somebody that you know. Who is that? Well, we don't want to say. We don't want to say. I beg your pardon. We haven't have the name for him. Give me a clue. I'll tell you the name. Okay. The name we called me. Not. Snuts? Snuts? I don't. I have no idea who that would be. It's a combination between good and snor. But I know what snor. Oh, it must be Mr. Ego. Mm. Yeah, see I know. Snor. That was a clue. Yeah. It couldn't have been anybody else. Yeah. It's a clue, right? Uh-huh. Yeah. How's he doing with his problems? He still has his problems. I bet I'm good. Mm-hmm. Thank you, thank you. To know him is to love him, isn't it? Well. I don't know. You gotta do something with him. Exactly. But I just wanted to call and say hello. I took your Carol and Timber's fine. Hello. Okay. Well, this in federal law prohibits us from speaking to Carol this morning. Sure, she got your message. Do right now. I know. But you're a sweetie. Thanks a lot. I love your hair. Okay. You put up. Bye-bye. Wow. So it's not enthusiasm. It's such unbridled enthusiasm as if they say it's a traffic. And incredible. Speaking of the track, now, when am I going to get out to colder? Yeah. When the hell are you? This weekend. Now, you said that last week. Sunday, I'm going to colder. You said that last week at this time. Well, I was going to go in and my good friend, my good racetrack buddy, crapped out on me. Did he really? Yeah, the guy they named the track after who's passed. He's been, I don't know what his story is. He's evasive and unfriendly. And I don't know what his deal is. Just because he has been working for six or eight months, whatever it is. But isn't he working? No. In Palm Beach? No. He was just the alleges that he just filled in there a couple of days. Too bad. I mean too bad. I don't want to go to work at that station. But I would like to see him with a job. That's what I'm saying. I would like to see him working. Because he should be. Why is that? Because he want to change his life now. Well, that's a good point. You got me there, Neil. Oh, you're my friend. Vice President George Bush, swept all but one of the 17 states that voted on super Tuesday. The most spectacular event of the 88 campaign. And so, commanding lead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Anyway, I'm going to be the next president of the U.S. He told supporters of the election. I hit towards the end of the joke about that. Okay? Well, he had nailed down victories in 16 states by midnight, including the four biggest Texas Florida, North Carolina and Massachusetts. And appeared to be raking in a rich hall of more than 600 of the 753 national convention delegates that were at state. Dave Voter said, guests to education and taxes yesterday by supporting the largest, most ambitious school bond issue in Florida history. Now, this vote will enable the day's scoreboard to float $980 million in bonds over the next five years, built 49 new schools renovate 161 schools and upgrade more than 250 schools. And still have enough money left over to pack lunch for early French Canadian on our way back home. And good news this morning because it's still king, but one of NBC's new prime time entries may have earned a place in this royal court. Day by day found its way into second place in last week's Nielsen. At least in one of its three showings, it's most successful night was on Thursday when it throught all the first place, cause be show. And I know you want to know this. So here it is, the third place show of the week was in BC's cheers. Okay, mostly cloudy today, breezy with a spiked hand to rain in a high of 82. Blood and night will be around 70, 73 this morning at last check. But we're going to double check it for you folks and just to be positive. Just a beginner Dave writer in his blifful list, oh, exactly. Say good morning, Dave. Say, day. We're going to be with Nielsen the morning at night called a Florida party line. 975, 449. 73. Like I said, that was good. Still 70, not a guy is getting all these free plugs on his show. I know. That's why he keeps saying that. 73. That's why we keep dialing it up. And this is obviously say to four, it's coming up on 752. 755 on Zeta 4. You know, the best call of the morning was that guy that we had a bleep. He was good. He just came out of nowhere. I was going along and singing so long and doing it. Then all of us said, it just came right out. See, I like that. Yeah, he's like that parent syndrome. Yeah. Yeah. I relate to it. Okay, now we have a very exciting call standing by and Broward. Hello. Oh, Niel. Hey, you waited this time. Great. Well, that happens all the time. Yeah, I'm sorry about that. I could see or two. Yes, I'm crushed. And the bird was crushed too. I got that from Michigan. And I heard that you were talking earlier about Michigan and that you had. Yeah, it's your way to what you're looking for. Dick Burton to call you. Yeah, we're waiting. Well, I was in the Friday. He's on Evergreen. You know what that is? Yeah. Yeah. I was in Friday. I met a girl at the sales rep. I talked to her about getting Dick Burton to call you. Really? Yeah, so he's going to try to call you this week while you're on the air. Well, he's on the air. That would be incredible. He's one of my all-time favorites. Hey, super. Yeah. Did you hear about the exit polling? A quite on the right. Coming out of an exit poll? No. And the answer was you voted for it. She says, oh, my heart told me to vote for her. No, I know. But Joe, I wish you was. I know. I know. Yeah. Great. On our way to Doug. Doug, start doing these jokes. We don't do jokes. Oh, no. Sir, we do please. Don't do this. You're going to do this to yourself. Don't do it. Try to restrain yourself. Okay. I know what I'm trying to get the name of the orange is the same as in Michigan. Boy, it's already famous, believe me. Isn't it? We're here for the radio in Michigan. In Calamazoo and in all kinds of other unmechanical places. Yeah. Oh, sure. I live there for 11 years in farming can help. Oh, and farming to hell. Now we're getting started on some good stuff right out there. Not too far from Northville down, right? That's exactly. And not too awfully far from La Voya and the Wolverine Hardest Raceway. Yeah. I've been there many times. Oh, say, uh, left a good deal of my income there. No question about that. Have we had a winner there though? Really? Hello? Yeah. All right. So we've got disconnected. Oh, Doug, don't panic now. I just thought I said was Wolverine and right away went into a panic and we're called Sweat. It's not that bad. You know, all the years I lived in Michigan have never seen a Wolverine. Have you really? Have you? No, I'm not that I think of it. It's just a Spartan, right? I never, in fact, I learned kind of as Spartan existence by self there for a long time. Oh, really? Yeah. But moving right along. Moving right along. We don't mean to call it. We don't mean to bind with this caller. Three way or that. Yeah. I just got off. I pulled up to work here. I just pulled up 95 and I'm going to go to work. And you have a nice day. You too. All right. Why, why? He's not leaving, is he? You know, everybody likes a little. But nobody likes a smart. You, you fill in the word, okay? Okay. Till minutes till eight o'clock on Zeta 4, our Michigan Bonanza starting momentarily. Why, why? Down, with a banana. Love, a rotten deal. Found that your devil hiding in her purse. He's cold in these hearts. But he got a pill. I hope it never happens to you. Some fruit breaks your marriage into. My wife left town with a banana. My baby's spent a way. I'm a jealous man. She found a six inch Latin. I'm a white-flifed town with a banana. I'm a jealous man. She found a six inch Latin. Love, a rotten house does the thing. Oh, her right hand. And right now I could just die. He's eating my banana cream pie. My wife left town with a banana. My baby's slipping. My baby's slipping. My baby's slipping away. I know. Yeah. I hope you beat me in the ring. You're better than I am. Even the competition agrees. The Neil Rogers show on WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is the best morning show in South Florida. He's been a nice year on an AM station as a year old in my book. You're like the same time as the quietest. You got no problem with me. Even the other morning shows listen to the Neil Rogers show on Saita 4. I hope you beat me in the ring. You're better than I am. Hey, to clock on Saita 4 and it's just a joke about Michigan. I don't want you to panic. What I'm going to go through a whole thing with Michigan colors today. What? I don't know. Certainly something to think about. For example, this color from Pembroke Pines couldn't possibly be from Michigan. Hello. Hello. Yes sir. This is Carroll City. Well, that's close to Pembroke Pines' right now. Hey Neil. Yes sir. I see your buddy's going to be out with K. Now see they just can't control it out. Oh, they're coming. Oh, yeah. Tom is everywhere. He's like a crawling disease. He's everywhere. Well, there's too much violence in sports today. Oh, that's exciting. Yeah. Isn't that exciting? Hmm, like too much violence in the dog track. That's right. Yeah. I just cut part of your show yesterday. The human-ish and Larry Glick. Yeah. Where is he now? Larry Glick's, I'm not sure if he's back on the area. He's on WHDH in Boston. Uh-huh. But did you know that he used to be on INZ down here? Yeah. Many, many years ago, he bombed down here. He was a total disaster here. I thought he was a J-Micle of his time. Exactly. Ha ha ha ha ha. Look what's happening to him now though. So there's hope even for J-I guess. Yeah. Hey. Uh, another thing. Uh, did you know he's flat? Off show. He was down here robbing all. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Robbing all. I don't know. I think he's in hiding. I think they spirited him away. He was always getting death threats and death threats. He's having all kinds of problems boy. I knew him. Yeah. Yeah. You're your buddy over on INZ. Got real issue. Are you in to guess today? Did he really? Oh my god. The whole day. Oh, I'm going to school bond issues. Wow. Well, well, it's good because he didn't get any response from people who wanted to rip New Yorkers. Uh-huh. He finally got his own show again. That's good. That's a good sign for his death. Oh, he was really, he was really hot. In fact, I would suggest he signed at least a three month lease at his house where he's going to rent. Oh, my god. Does he listen to tapes on your show before he goes on? Yes, he does. I got four hours of your show and then four hours of his own. Yeah, he's got a rich full life, sir. But I think that'll, that'll change very soon when this marriage takes place. He's going to straighten him out, huh? So to speak. Yes, so to speak. Yeah, last thing. You have the bird. Look at the Fred Pascar item today on our friend commissioner Phillips. Okay. All right. Well, do. Keep up the good work. See you later.

We're not allowed to have. I had to get, I have to get the herald today in pieces. So I have to go back and get that later. But I will do that. I don't know what it is about this plate. They only give it to me one section at a time. It's like the Soviet Union. You get like rationed. No, they only give it to you a little at a time. I can relate to that. It's a no two on four. If you go back that way, Captain Dave, could you snack that for? And we have a call from Papino, which is probably really Pembroke Pines. Hello. Papino? Pembroke Pines. Nobody? There we go. Yeah. It's noodles. Come on, get cereal. Will you please don't keep the prices? I can't handle the agony. Great. I missed you. You're the owner. Can't see. Call up. Yes, he did. What's he coming in?

A friend of a friend of a friend, a friend of a friend, a friend of a friend. You know, the very least they could bring his hair in here or something. If they can't bring his whole body, he'll be bringing some of the hair in or something. And what about this, Ruma? I just turned to radio on it. Ruma cat and Dave's in seeing Patty Murray or something. That's the popular room. Yeah. That might be what Josh like. Thomas will upset this one. That's why he's drugs a little scratchy. If you ever heard of voice. Yep. Okay. You hang in there. Okay. Okay. He's hanging out. Put it back in here. It's 804 on Zeta4, the weather ought to be extraordinary. Did he shouldn't it? It's already pretty decent out there. It's going to be alright. Wouldn't it be a great day for the kids from Cooper City High to combine their bathing suits? It's going to be a little bit. Just you, Alan. It's all we need. It's going to be a lot of you keep acting like I'm going to rub ten years. Something he's like hanging in high and stuttering. I thought you asked me to do this. Did you ask me to do this? I actually do it. Yeah. But I didn't necessarily mean all at once. Like continuously. You could do it like a little choppy bits of pieces. I like doing it like that. You got a weather thing for him. But I don't know if you can find it. Oh, the weather. It's mixed in with other stuff. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think it's labeled either. Yeah. Oh, it's not easy. Listen. I can handle it. I mean, I know that this isn't a big time radio. He's a 77. He's a 75. He's a 75. He's a 75. Mostly cloudy and breezy on 77 this morning. We do have a slight chance of rain.

Make no bones about it. It bounces the place for barbecue. I'm telling you, you can go to a lot of other places at claim to have the best ribs in town. Have all got their cliches and her slogans. And bones doesn't need that because what they've got are those great secret recipes that they've been pumping out for 58 years. And the end result, mouth watering. I mean, just delicious. The best barbecue ribs, beans and coleslaw and all those other fictions and home style, corn, down home stuff. You know what I'm talking about. And if you're not into that kind of stuff, you're not into barbecue. They've got a great menu. They've got delicious seafood sandwiches, chicken, country dinners, and all the fictions. There's that word again, right? And be sure to save room for one of their homemade desserts too. And if you're not an archaeologist, you're looking for bones.

You're spilling coffee all over now. That you're new contribution to the show. Very good. Did a good job, by the way. Much ago in the eight track room, it's built some of it in the board there. I think it's kind of astonishing that we have like people or not strangers, but people don't even work here. Uh-huh. Who go in and just manhandle the equipment in there and kind of turn everything upside down and twist the knobs. You ever problem with that? Because I was doing dubbing all that stuff on Sunday and I looked at the car machine. I had everything going. I thought it was right and there was no volume. The needle wasn't moving. And of course, while I opened it up and somebody had messed with the buttons in here and all of that. Which thank God, at least of technical enough to understand that. But it's kind of fun to have kind of non-working people. Somebody had adjusted the gain control. On Monday, Metro Commissioner Beverly Phillips was contrite and angry with herself over her driving out of the influence charge. On Tuesday, she hired Richard Essin to defend her. I wonder how many days before he shows up on a certain show for the 4,000-thiamden this year. Hmm. Right? I mean, what a great attorney here is, you know, defending the drunk. Isn't that great defending people around there and dangering other people's lives? As soon as the high profile drunk driving lawyer who informs from 60 minutes to people magazine, boasts 100 jury wins to every jury loss. I don't understand. What is it supposed to prove? 100 wins to every loss? Is that correct? He was on 60 minutes. Yeah. Oh, yeah, he's the drunk. I mean, not the drunk lawyer, but he's the lawyer that the, the exact DUI's. Oh, yeah. He's the, uh, sobriety. Oh, yeah, I remember him. Hmm. The drunk lawyer. Yeah, the drunk lawyer. Yeah. I don't like that name. You say it a couple more times, and you'll see how fast he'll sue your ass. Okay. Boy, you know, I surround with lawyers on here unless of course it's Ellis, then you can have a lot of fun. Because he's got a great sense of humor. You don't know any? Ten minutes past date on Zeta. And we'd be going to Miami. We don't even have to give the numbers out anymore. You know that is not exciting. I like that. That's how much the audience has gotten into this damn show. Okay? They are so deeply into it. And here are the BGs and how deep is your love on Zeta 4? Wouldn't that be something if we played that? That would get Dennis Fulger, apoplectic. And you notice he's conspicuous by his absence? He's been goofing off lately. You know that he has really been goofing off. Seriously, he's supposed to be here 715, 730, early, and leave late. Yes, he is. He's supposed to be in early bird. Well, Glen and I have worked for PDs that didn't show up to like one in the afternoon. Well, and that probably was a bonus in a lot of cases. You mentioned that you had two and came in at four, left at five. How much damage could he do? Miami, hello. Hello. Yeah. You got a song? Yeah. Go ahead, sir. Hey, I want to push over there for things to grow. Let's push you aside and tell you what's the thing. Got the dragon. I'd rather let you ride it. You're running on the platform. You're running on the platform. That was good one. I think there was one word in there that maybe was a little bit nervous, but that could not It's a great spell. I know you tried very hard to speak, but don't worry about it. It'll be alright. Just to take two hours, but then call us tomorrow. 11 past eight on Zeta 4. And look at that.

We had to get Eric Brandon and Penny Mority together. Would that be a match made and have a look? Yeah. She could scratch his beautiful hair with her voice. Let's see. Now, wait a minute. We have an open line in day. This could be a critical situation. Six to 0 3600 is a day number. Kind of. Wow. You got candle up there on the board captain, Monk Kendall. Hello. Yes, sir.

That's sensation. That's phenomenal. Yeah. I don't know if I'm going to be right or I won $56 off him many, many years ago. Did you really? When he was on another station with uh, with those numbers. QA on an AM side. Ah, yeah. On the end of the downward it kind of like slips off the end of a lot of radios. That's right. Oh. Anyway, did you have a wonderful life? I'm enjoying your show. Thanks a lot. Thank you. Well, boy, that sounded like a familiar voice. I don't want to put him on his spot, but that sounded like one of our people from the industry. Didn't it? A little sound like a radio person to you. I'm sure it did, the main way. And brought back to my face. You can't pull the wool over our ears. You know what I'm saying? Eight 15 on Zeta 4. I know this is going to come as a shock to you. I'm going to play the whole record. What? Yeah, from the motion picture of the same name. Oh, this reminds me of a rock. From the movie of the big chill. Yeah. I was eating a lunch of Don and Bob's one day back up in Rochester. When the night has come. And the land is dark. And the moon is the only night we'll see. No, I won't be afraid. Oh, I won't be afraid. Just as long as you stand by me. So don't stand by me. Bob's there by me. Oh, there's there by me. Oh, there's there by me. If the sky, then we look upon. Should I'm all in, Bob? All the mountains should crumble to the sea. I won't cry. I won't cry. No, I won't. Shit of tears. Just as long as you stand by me. And all the mountains stand by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Oh, there by me. Stand by me. Stand by me. We're in all your info, all who just stand by me. Okay, all you river Phoenix freaks out there just put it back where it was. It's 18 past eight on Zeta 4. You know, we should have done before we played that and I was remiss. Zeta 4. Uh, vintage. 1970. Okay. That's 10 years off. It was 61, not 71, but nobody knows it. Uh-huh. So it's not important that the year is correct. It's important that they hear that voice. So did you see that story? Because you were talking about Rochester yesterday. And now you're playing that today. And there was a story in the hairl about that girl from Rochester, New York that was trying to simulate the scene in front of the train. Really? Yeah. And she misjudged and got run over by the train. And she really. Oh, serves her right. I mean, anybody that's that stupid. She was trying to simulate the scene in the movie. So you know how these things kind of fall together. That was kind of a coincidence. And here's a smokey Robinson in the miracles and the tracks of my tears. On Zeta 4. Now was she from what she from Rochester, Captain? Yes. It's that she was from Rochester. Yeah. So there's got to be a few dumb people out there. Oh, no, no. No. No. There have to be a few dumb people. But you know this, we get rid of them, see? Oh, absolutely. That guy in a trainman. He's sped up to about 195 miles an hour. He did. He's going like a bad out of hell. We just don't like dumb people in Rochester, okay? In other words, most of the people from Florida would never been permitted to live there. And I know who the hell are these people that are driving in. It's getting to be that time. Yeah. It's 20 past eight. You know what that means? All these panning ass. They're a cry. So what's your cry? And middle-level management and lower level management. And upper level bureaucrats.
