Turn it off because they want to see if we're gonna make it. You know, if I'm gonna make it, they're gonna carry me out of here. You know what I think will do? You know, how like, a done Cox used to do all that can tribe stuff. To try to get publicity. Yeah. Really helped them a lot. Didn't it? He used to. Yeah. Well, he's been known to do it every now and then since then too. I think what we'll do is just, uh, maybe we can find another card of these somewhere. That's what she said. She said there were like bird droppings over our shoulders. Okay. Here's the Barbie report for the bird on, uh, date County line too. Hello. It's still getting a fingerprint software from the other night. Yeah. You're right. Look into this. This is another one of our guests, the other night. Boy, made one of his cameo appearances. How come my screen just went out captain Dave? Well, what an effect you had on my screen. Why is it? Why is it time delay? Oh, cut it out. Would you please? It's joking. I want to find out a go-glend, the we in Barbie and the other voice and I could give you the phone number now. Oh, the Barbie report about that young lady. Now, you said she had a big ass. Oh, I don't know. Remember her Dave said. Yes. I remember. Yes. She's, oh, she does have a phone call. I like that. I hope you're listening too. Yeah. Yeah. I thought she was cute. She was incredible. Yeah. I thought she was very cute. No one backed up. She was fine. Yeah. Well, Abby, uh, she isn't even my type and she just, uh, she was fantastic. I can't believe that's Barbie. Now she's too crazy for Glenn. She's too crazy. He's totally out of it. Yeah. And if she was hanging around with you guys, you want has to really wonder what that's all about. Yeah. I thought that she was something lacking. You're like, Calcy, or something in the brain. Yeah. Absolutely. I'm liking. And, um, well, she wants to, um, she wants to be Glenn's, um, bear his first child. No problem. Yeah. I have to give you the- No, I beg to differ with that. Uh, there has to, you know, in order to do that, there's certain equipment necessary. Trust me, Abby. Well, I'm Glenn. And that's half of the battle. I think I'll give Glenn the phone number off the radio. Yeah. Call me after 10. No, I can't call you after. Why? Because. I'll put him on hold and Captain Dave will take the number off. Yeah. I'll tell him how to wait a minute. Wait a minute. In other words, you're really taking this number? Yeah. Well, I used to have it. Barbie and I go way back. I used to have it too, but lately it's, uh, nobody and I go way back. Oh, stop. What do you place? Oh, you just- Oh, did Neil, do you want the number? No, I don't want the number. Oh, although the way things are going lately, you know, I made it. Well, I don't know one person is interested. In what? Well, and, uh, moving in. Oh, uh, they were kicked out of the apartment the other day, uh, one of the, one of the reason I did DJs, Stan, the man he would love to move in. Stan, the bear. Well, I'm not running a boarding house. Okay, in fact, uh, this one, but I have one border that I'm trying to, uh, move out. Oh, but this is not the brothel of the year. Okay, like this is back in Phoenix, okay? Okay, let me put you on hold before you just totally destroy your credibility, what little is left, aren't you? What I call. Okay, that's on, uh, two. You get a lot of sleazy calls to that. Yeah. That's okay. Yeah. That's D-Fruke. Yeah, C-On FM, we welcome him on AM. We used to pretend that we discouraged. Oh, I didn't know that. I didn't get the member. I'm not FM. He's okay. I didn't get a memo about a change. Oh, are you not allowed to speak to him anymore? I thought I'd just hear him speaking to him. Now the word from Gary Lawrence was the next time he speaks to him on the phone. He's out. No, no, it's okay if it's on the year. No, he never said that. He didn't? No. I was in there when he said it. And Mark Kune said that tuna, you don't work for him anymore. But Peter Bulger would certainly back us up. Didn't you just hear him talking to, um, fruit cake like you were? Sort of like you. Yeah, but I don't have any, uh, any altumatoes. Okay. In other words, I can talk to over the hell. I want my show. No, no, no, no. He missed the point here. What they did not want me to do was talking to him, you know, like privately. But on the air, the other words, the entire conversation, I want you to yenthe with him. That's correct. And on the air, they hear the entire conversation. Realize it was really nothing, you know, uh, no information. Yeah, I think that's what they were saying. That conversation, they realized there was nothing. Very, very well. So that's okay. I agree.
