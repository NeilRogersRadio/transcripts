I don't think this was a long enough cut, you know. It's 605. No, I would have been 604, yeah you're right. 605. So I think you should have picked a longer cut. Yeah. Well, like five minutes like maybe in a god of divinity. Yeah, that would have been a good way. Yeah, because then we could still be like opening up the cinnamon rolls and stuff like that. Anyway, the April Fool could be on us today before this is over. You don't understand? I won't hope not. They've to fool on the FCC because the idea is, oh, you had WZTMI and me beach for waterdale in the Palm beaches. We play just fools. No, no, we have five minutes to get that in. I think so. Yeah, you decide to be ours. And I think, well, it was pretty close. All depends on who's watched. We're getting the time from, okay? But anyway, here we are at it's a wonderful Friday morning at table Fool's Day and we're at my house, which don't ask me why. Rose Fool just came running outside the door one day earlier early in the week and said, we're going to think of being a great idea to do the show on April Fool's Day. You know, do something different. And we'll do it from your house. And I think the only reason is because he knows he's never going to get invited to the house. Oh, or any other circumstance. So this is the excuse that he's going to use to come and muscle and check out the house. Anyway, we want to thank TJ Sinniman for, I just can't believe it. If you could see in the kitchen how much of this there is. Really? You would just freak out. Look at that weather, man. Yeah. What is his story anyway? By the way, we're going to watch TV. Remember what the Pope was here last year? And I did a little play by play off the TV. Right. So we're going to watch the morning show on CBS because nobody else is in probably in the whole county. And they may be one or two in day to think that it's a foreign language station or something like that. But yeah, he is an interesting looking weather guy. In fact, it looks like he could use wood and scots here. He's an amazing. They got a token white guy Charlie on. Did he got a little one? How does that feel? It would be the token white on the new show. Well, see that. How does he know that Jesse Jackson is doing pretty good. They figured that maybe they're going to move more in that direction. Anyway, it's what is it? It's about 607. We have no idea. We have no concept of what's going on. We have no clue. We're kind of like everybody else in South Florida now. No clue. You know, if there was an 05 break. I haven't got any idea. No idea. We have nothing. We have clue though. I did. I get you back. We have food. We have a newspaper. We have the Harold. So we can steal all kinds of good stuff out of that. We don't have USA today yet. So if there's anybody on the way over here, like Dennis Foltz, like Rose Foltz, you might pick one up because when I went out to get the papers and I still yesterday's thing. So maybe you wouldn't want to read yesterday's stuff. And I'm sure he's no. I'm sure he's listening to see for us. You think so? Now are we on the air by the way? Well, see now. I told you about that. We're here. That's true. That famous Daningrum April Fool's joke story, which is a legendary radio story, which you had never heard. One time on April Fool's Day, WABC New York. Yeah. WABC. They had Daningrum to a remote on April Fool's Day. And he did this entire show. He did a four hour show. And never was on the air. That was the April Fool's joke. Yeah. So there were people in this market who showed like that almost every day. Speaking of that. Yeah. Right off the top. Are you going to do radio highlights? Oh no. You're going to congratulate somebody. Got married for the 11th time. I'm going to read this out of the Miami Herald. This is page 1B. I'm going to read it as they wrote it because I liked the way. But it's in the hero. You know, it's got to be true. This is Roy Ish. Roy's column. I asked H.O.I. Do you know Roy? One of my favorites. I love this show. Roy says congratulations to Gloves 94 District. Greg Budell who popped the question last night to traffic reporter Joe Anne Rice. Immediately he loaps. We're told it's Budell's 11th marriage and her first. You're laughing but you know something that could be true. You said four. But he's had so much to like no seriously. Two days. Yeah. Maybe several of those. I think I missed a couple of hours. I think I missed one. I heard last at about 25 minutes. I could be as well. I was just you know, she just got a screaming and ran out of the. Yeah. I laughed but it might be right. That was the problem. Yeah. Well, this house has got an echo. I like this reverb. I don't know. I mean this is a nice house. You'll admit that. Oh yeah. I'm here in the lake and it's a nice view. But it's not the Taj Mahal. Yeah. I don't really. I can feel you. They just don't know what it is that they want. You know what I mean? I like that. It is kind of Taj Mahal. Now we do have one thing we know because we have no ability to play. We're not going to play any music today because we don't. We're just out of touch about commercials. Probably we won't play any of those either. Okay. The best of it's on a musical. When you work for this company, that's not unusual. But anyway, no actually we could play like CDs. Oh my god. And hold on. I might expensive. Hope speakers back there. Yeah. They probably prank those up like up the whole goddamn neighborhood. Great. But anyway. So we're like just sitting in your hanging out. And I think the April Fool was definitely on us. Now we can take calls. They tell us. They're going to try it. Tell us. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Two hours here yesterday and they came here at 4.5. This morning. Okay. And they've been working feverishly ever since. So it's fever in the morning. And Peter bulls your all night or something. Now we don't know the numbers. But you people have to know that. I think I do. I think it's 620 3600 in day. Really? And 779 3600 in Brower. But I will confess. You're not. You're not. But a couple of minutes ago. They've never kind of been alluded. Seriously. The day number kind of had escaped me for a moment or two. Yeah. Yeah. So anyway. We have a special guest come and buy some time during the show. I don't know what he's going to show up. But we will have at least one piece of music. Casey. How about Casey? Is it going to stop by here and he can come by the house any time? We have a lot of room to get kicked out again. Here he can come by here any time you like. Got all kinds of extra bedrooms. And speaking of that, some of our friends from Cooper City are going to be stopping by. And of course if you missed the end of the show yesterday. Oh my god. Everybody was talking about the end of the show. That was incredible. Yeah. If you missed the last half hour, you missed the radio. Classic. So you turned out that that guy who was pretending to be a coach or an assistant something at the Cooper City Hospital. He turned down to be pain in the ass junior. Okay. Now you know who pain in the ass senior is. Very well. We can't talk about something just fell off the wall. By the way, I don't want to get anybody out here Jim or Andy upset. But something just fell off the wall. I think it was the antenna. Which is because it sounds better now. Doesn't it sound better? Yeah. Although it doesn't have it. We shouldn't be monitoring off the or anyway. Should we we should be monitoring program. Right. Are we on delay? We don't know. We don't have any idea. No. So it's kind of exciting. Anyway, it's 11 and a half after six. The weather is going to be about 80 today, right? Yep. Mostly sunny, high near 80, low near 70. And it's 72 this morning. I don't know what you should give the timer. You think? Well, let's give it a try. This is what you would have. It's okay. What the hell? This is a four. It's almost 12 past six. Well, you were right. It was kind of fun to just wait and see. Well, I mean, there's no break. Whoever is on the board, if they open the mic and they talk. We can hear. Well, now. Okay. Now let's mention that. Okay. Now Captain Dave is already conspicuous. That's right. His absence. The audience isn't getting nervous about it. They're getting used to that. But he isn't going to be coming in at all. Right. And it's a rather bizarre story. Because I got this phone call last night. Well, actually, what happened is it was 11 o'clock. And the phone rang the first time. Okay. And a female voice on the other end when I answered it said, Oh, I must have the wrong number. And then like a minute later, it rang again. And it was Captain Dave. It doesn't that the net happens to you. Don't you kind of like put two and two together? Like somebody is testing the water. I didn't wake you up. So in other words, I guess he assumed if he had somebody else called the first call, that met with a wake me up anyway. Okay. So that I'd be awake a minute later. Oh, that's a call. Correct. I was at a fair. So in other words, I can't blame him. But the bottom line is I was sitting right where you are watching TV, watching the hit your as a matter of fact. You need to see that a few more times. Yeah. Yeah. Watching what your hour watching. See Thomas Allen spit and what your hour is face for the idiot. Yeah. And anyway, I'm sitting here watching it and can't the davis on there. He says, you're not going to believe this and I'll watch you up set. But I got a chance to make $20,000. I wasn't in a grand the other day. Wasn't that the, I thought it was story. Yeah. Today the story is he's making 20 grand doing some TV commercial again. It's possible. It is. Hmm. Well, if this continues like in about another two weeks, can we tie her? Okay. I mean, it's nice working with him. But it is right. Because the next bottle probably would be like a half a million. I don't think there's a meeting more next. You know, look, there's a duck. Is a duck. We have all the wildlife out here. In fact, even big day, we'll be waking up in a little bit. There's lots of wildlife in my house. Big day is sleeping though. Well, I know if he's still asleep, but I did close his door. Okay. He's not here because he'll give a very grumpy up. Although he did say he would get up for TJ's cinnamon. He didn't realize they'd be coming in and forward to six. He'll be up. He'll be up in an hour. They brought enough food for the Chinese army. I'm telling you. I'm going to be in front of him. I'll eat that later. I got the no bones coffee cup. Yeah. I really set it up pretty good for it. I have to. Your own bones coffee cup. I made you a big pot of chocolate and not scoffy, which nobody in his house drinks coffee. It's real good. And I made you an automatic thing in there. Whatever it is. And I even made it right. It's excellent. Yeah. I mean, it's not like Dennis Folder. Nobody makes a cup of coffee like Rose. But it's great. But it's a rose by any other than that. So anyway, here we are. And we just haven't got the bucket. But you know, it's how we've already killed one. Let's see. I think that Dean on Zeta 4 and can you imagine what the audience is thinking about this at this point? Like we have no music. We have no, uh, uh, law. Well, we certainly are going to play any cards because we don't have any card. No, no, no, no, no. God forbid that anybody back there could start fiddling with any cards. Okay. Now that room's. I'm going to ask you something. If we're monitoring like something just dawned on. I don't know. Seriously, if we're monitoring. Off program instead of off the year. Are you are you paying a you see what I'm saying? No, we necessarily going to hear the spots. I come. We're monitoring off the air. Uh, Joe no have to answer these questions. I guess maybe he can. Oh, wait a minute. How can we be monitoring off the year? And other words we're not in delay is that what you're telling me. We're not in delay. We're not in delay. So why the hell did I give those phone numbers out? That was kind of stupid. It wasn't. Yeah. I think of those numbers. That's because if we aren't in delay, then the audience will pick up on it immediately. Right. And if somebody will call it and say, you know, something like that. And, you know, we don't want to do that again. Because Captain Dave's not here to take credit for it. Well, that's a serene. But we don't really need to take any call. Yeah. You do understand it. I try to tell Rose that the other day. But he insists that it's something that we desperately want to do. Okay. Because the calls are the lifeblood of the show. So he will be back the phone. The back phone. Yeah. As Flipper would say, the backbone of the show. Maybe Luke Halpin will call it in a later on. Ah. That's possible. Well, I like that friendly attitude. He had when we caught him the last time. Like that. But you guys want it. Leper is dead. Leper is dead. Leave me alone. Leper is dead. Yeah. Leper is very dead. Well, the original one. But he did mention that his Flipper was still alive. Just barely. He said. But that's another story. Yeah. So anyway, we got in the hero here this morning. And maybe USA today is on the way. So we got to show, right? The horse by the way that you counted in the second race yesterday was scratched. I told you would. Oh, God. Schwam and the fat better than coming in last. No, it's better than coming in last. And I told you, don't see you don't pick horses that have numbers like 13 and 17 and 18. You know, because they're not going to run. Very often. I don't get in. Well, I'm new at this. Yeah. You know, but I'm going to keep trying. Do you want one for one? You picked a horse that was 28 lengths behind a field on Wednesday. Which I think was very good. I have a lot of expertise that I can still do that. Knowing nothing and being able to do that was something very special. So anyway, KC is going to come by later, which is incredible. I think he's actually coming to my house. There is. And then Bob and Ted and Alice and whoever those other people are coming by Bob and Harlan and Michelle. Okay. I know this Bob really goes anywhere without Michelle because it's like kind of line us in a security blanket. And especially coming to my house who will not come here without her. Yeah. And the little later on is a special treat and it might be kind of an inspirational thing for the show. I'm going to push in the video tape that they brought us to the professional. Oh, of course. And the amazing part of it is there are almost no ugly kids that go to that school. I know we don't want to get started again because pain in the ass junior. Well, probably be on the phone and the carrying on having a apple apple, apple, apple, apple, like the fit or whatever it is. But there are really incredible, a people in that school. So maybe what we'll do a little later on is we'll cruise down. Oh, that's right. There's nobody in school today. No. So we'll just have an outcome over here. Yeah. And I saw I noticed on driving to work this morning. There were some kids that had obviously, you know, people driving around the road to it. Obviously, we're heading home. Yeah. Just getting in. And you can tell schools out. A few few cars that you don't normally see the type on the road at five in the morning. Obviously, heading home, you know, been up all night doing God knows what. Yeah. I'm afraid to be kids today. Boy, me too. And Alan's out of town. Yeah. I'll tell you this has been funny. That's why you seem so happy for me. Now to be something if it was an April Fool and it turned out that he was not allowed. But listen, Monday, I wasn't, I wasn't at work. What a day to miss. His last visit. Yeah. I miss. If you would have been there, it would have been, you know, you know, fireworks would have been like the fourth of July. I'm still talking about it probably. And today he's out of town. So this has been a lunch. Oh, I think. Oh, he said he was going out of town down the cruise. So this mate, perhaps, what did you like to be? Now, wait a minute. Talk about being a captive audience. How would you like to be on a cruise ship? Oh, Alan. God. Like out in the middle of the Atlantic. Holy Toledo. Because the one good thing about that for him is that you can't get away. No, like Martin the Van Dellos would say, there's nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. You know what I mean? No, where to go? Well, I have this feeling that next week, there's no school next week. I have a feeling. Oh, week, there's going to be a visit. And that's going to be interesting. That's going to be a good one. We could have a lot of visits next week because it could be on a school. We'll see. Although we don't want to get certain people on the air of set, who we don't even talk about anymore. It was really relaxing here. You know, all yesterday afternoon, with my radio and the off position. Oh, really very relaxed. I don't think you missed much. No, I have a feeling. So we want to try this again. It's almost 20 a.m. After. Well, see what we'll do periodically throughout the morning. Let's see what happens. We'll just say, like, you know, we're going to give a time check in if there are spots if you want to play back there. Go ahead and if that will just play. We'll just keep rambling on because we can go on here for an eternity. I mean, there's no ending to the PS to go on here. No problem. And the gons are now the email point of this before we came on the air, which I think is a very interesting observation. Gons are and he's bringing his wife to, by the way, because I guess they heard that possibilities will bring a lunch and there's free food here today. And probably is kid. Oh, really? Probably. Wouldn't you think? Are you serious? I don't know, but if he's bringing his wife, what about the day? And then the lead to level be here from three to seven. So, you know, the idea that this is such a piece of cake for me, because it's like, stay in at home and you don't have to drive a whole 20 minutes. And each direction, right? Instead of my day ending at like 10 past 10, it's going to end. It's going to end. It's going to end. It's going to end. So it's going to wind up. I got up at four. Yeah. Let's see. Four and four is 12, a 50 hour day. Well, listen, I'm going to run over to Johnny Darks later on. Simple live. You want to come along. Yeah. You're not joking about that either. No, no. The frightening part. I saw that. Do we want to give his address on the air? I mean, that's been basically done to me. So I'll be sure that. No, that's not. Like the street address with a number. Oh, no. Let me try this break thing. See what happens. Okay. Whatever you like. I couldn't hear unless I'm going to start eating breakfast. Good. Well, let's see if we can do a spot. Seriously. If you do get in touch with Sherry Hall, make sure you don't eat on the phone while you're talking to her. Seriously. She would get very testing. I'll set it up. I don't like that. That's true. So anyway, we're back. And that one pretty smoothly, right? What? Yeah. Smooth. Yeah. That's the word. I was thinking. That's her. I don't know if it would be because I would have to like make them up. Yeah. Well, you could do that. You're making up the show. Can we like tropical look called it? Yeah. We can go. Yeah. We got the entries right here. And in fact, I'm going to look at them again. See if any little later on. Yeah. Later. I'm going to look at when the plunger's starting up about eight o'clock. So anyway, it's a six 24. Oh, no. It's six 25 on Zedon. I can just imagine that our regular audience listening this is thinking, boy, they're right. This is an April Fool. Mm-hmm. Don't you feel like an April Fool? Yes, I do. Exactly. Completely. But you really look comfortable. I will say that. I am kind of my feet up and this couch is this is a lot more comfortable than I listen. I hear tweeting. You're right. And this is a lot more comfortable than the studio. Yeah. That's what my feet are. That is a point. In fact, I'm going to take my shoes off. Yeah. I may put my swimming, my shorts on. Now, pull you to the wall. No, no, no, no. You got your shoes off. Oh, oh. By the way, things get boring. You notice that's an old man the way that I think is my dad. We can call you Carlos. People don't have to call us. We can call us. Yeah, we'll call out. Because I've got some great numbers in our effect. There's Peter Volger. We can call her. Oh, I guess I better not give this whole number on here. How about if I just give certain numbers? We could talk. We could have a nice conversation with Michelle. She could probably tell us maybe some interesting things. Oh, that Michelle. Peter Volger. Yeah, this is for all of you. She's probably posting on some really important things. That's another story for another day, right? Who is this chick that's on a news now? I have no idea. I can't believe him. Is this the black network? This is the CBS. Seriously, there are no white people on this thing. I've got one. You know, one white Charlie Osgood, but he was just there for briefly. He was just a two limerics, two little lines of poetry. Now look at that. There's a room from your favorite city from Sarasota. Those of you who want to save a lot of electricity. Seriously, this is a good idea. Because your TV set is one of your highest next to your air conditioning. I could be wrong. But I think the next to your air conditioning, your TV set is the highest drag. If I can say that on your electric bill, you don't think so? I'd like you got a full pump like that when it's running constantly. TV doesn't use that much doesn't? Color TV, are you out of your mind? I didn't know. Oh yeah. I didn't know that. Now your radio uses almost nothing. Right. Which is why it's good to keep it on like 24 hours a day. Even when you're sleeping, keep it on. And then just remember that you had it on Zeta 4 and right it down as I say. Right it down. So anyway, you don't have to watch your TV. You can keep it all. And we'll just do a little play by play. If I may go flip around the channels. For those of you who've got American cable and are really peoed about it, we'll just flip around and we'll see that by the way. Now channel 5 up in the Palm Beach. Not too good. We don't get that in date. Or really? We don't get 5. Let's back it up. Okay. And back this could probably kill the next half hour. Now it's just sunshine sports network. Look at that. Speaking now, look at this rady thing that just walked in the door. It's Dennis Folder. It really did. It's me and it's not even with our picture. Not a log. What's that? No, you said today. No, nothing. Nothing. Empty hand. Or you think you're getting breakfast. You're out of your mind. Why are you wanting to see like walking around like. He's got what? Don't sweat it. Don't start picking on them. They've been working there a buts off. Okay. Just don't do panic. So anyway, I forget that he's here. Okay. The play books plus. Okay. Now channel 2 with a nice sunset. There's not peace. Now I like this channel. This is mellow. Yeah. It just stays there. I think like for a very, like a very long time. You shouldn't watch this. It's not sun. Oh, that's a sun. Whatever. I would think it would just stay. And this is something to hire in this guy. And then you have midday sun. This is a good. Yeah. We don't have this on my table. That's what the sued watch. This is the sun channel. This is channel 2. This is WPBT. That's a good service. You just to sunrise. It's the sunrise over the Atlantic. Okay. Now there's HBO. Look at that. They're running chromat the front. Yeah. And then we get to a channel 4 with this black morning news show. You're running news. Yeah. You're going to be amazed. But channel 5. Now I want you to see. I let that run for a while because you don't know. Nearly get that in the county. Yeah. Can I take a look at that desperate log that you've got there? I know. Now he's reading the log. Okay. I can't believe it. Like he's doing the show. The man is just out of his mind. You know. You don't like the picture quality. They have here with now. Channel 5 is not coming into good. That's really not. There's no excuse for that because I think. I could be wrong. But I think here in plantation. We're not like all that far from West Palm Beach. Could I be right? Not that bad. Now you're not that bad. If you're in Broward County. Oh, like look at this. Okay. We do have it on a break this hour. Now you have a log now. Yep. It's reversed. It's not. What do you want? It's reversed. Who mong done this? No, not that. You mong done my log. He just walked in the door. He's mong done my log. Oh, I see. Well, we're not at 7 o'clock. Oh, in other words, the pages are like backward. There you can. What we can handle that is no problem. We're used to that. We work with backward people every day. Look at that. That wasn't I psychic. Tropical occultor is on here live. I don't think we could have any problem. And it shels us on here, which I think we'll have no problem with that. Basically be it. Right? I don't sure think that guns are really, you're not going to have a swell time here today. I don't know what they're going to do. But I haven't got the foggy. What they're going to like the reverb. They're going to like the reverb. They were like the echo and the echo and the echo. I'm not question about that. In fact, that could be one of the things we'll take a poll on. We'll be later on if we ever take any poll. That's not likely. But how did you like the reverb in my house? Because I get bitched at like crazy all the time. They like that echo. Oh, I'll give it a hug. It says like living in a cavern. He'll do it. So why don't you try it? Why don't you go out like the West Virginia? They have those crawls bad caverns. And they got a bit. They go living one of those for a while. See which one you're like better. The roses here and looking just absolutely gruesome this morning. You can't believe that. Doesn't he? Well, I wild man. You know, I have this affinity for anyone who wears alcoholic beverages on their body. You know, signs about now. He has a bud light, but McKinol. Yeah. He showed. I mean, this man is redefining fashion. Okay. Now, here's the worst. One of the worst. Sex channels on everybody's cable system unless you live in homestead. Mine's crystal clear. Well, yeah, because I was a way in South Bay and I look at how channel six, even on the cable comes in and look at all the, um, there's video noise noise. And look at that. Oh, no, no, it's gone. It's incredible. Of course, you know, when you're watching cartoon, it's very attractive. Seriously, to have all that noise across the screen. Yeah, because you don't want to be streamer to banana. But anyway, the stuff here from TJ Sentiments is incredible and possible. The music catering lunch. So for those people who get all upset when we eat on the air, I'm, you know, I'm not, I was going to say, I'm sorry. I'm not an elisput sorry. That's your problem. Okay. Yeah. But we're going to eat quietly. You know, it's like the first world where we didn't even know. You never even made a peak. But we don't have the noise. The second one will be a little bit louder though. You don't have those noise, but pick up every single sound of anything. You know, we have more like, what are these mics? I don't even know if they are. Why don't you take the cozy off and take a look at me? I don't have any electric voice. Oh, yeah. It's like the old A and the cheap. Yeah. Yeah. No, well, that's what we used to use on an electric voice. 631. Yeah. In case you'll be here any minute. Are you going to be here early? No, I probably be here by 945. You're thinking you'd suffer to sound like it. No, I could be coming home. You're out of your mind. Yeah. So anyway, how do I eat this with one hand and hold the microphone of the eye? You're doing all right. You're a difficult. You'll work it out. So anyway, getting back to a Captain Day, we never really quite finished off that story, didn't we? Oh, before, okay. Then we go through the rest of the cable. Mm-hmm. Oh, wait a minute. We're still leaving that six. Yeah. Go to seven. Go to seven. There's that comes in very well. And that way you can see Sally Fitz, like just crystal clear and Peter Ford. There's Channel seven. That's the today show I guess with Bryant and Jane and Willard. And that doesn't start this early. Doesn't it? Seven. Yeah. So I need to break the news. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. This is very mellow though, you know. I can't imagine that anybody in their right mind is listening to it, but it is very mellow. We're happy. Yeah. If anybody is listening this morning, just call and flash the lines. Okay, and then they can let us know back at the station if anybody's calling. Wouldn't be something if nobody did. Mm-hmm. Serely. Six to all. The 3,600 in date. And seven, seven, nine, 3,600 in Broward. I don't panic because we're not going to talk to you. Just one of those. I don't think we can if we want to anywhere. Do you? I don't know. I have no idea. I don't know. Michael Williams. Now he's Switzerland. He could be the replacement for Misha on Channel 10. Oh, great. Yeah. Because he's kind of like thin. He's a good looking guy, but he's thin. Got a real thin face. And if they put a couple of long earrings. Yeah. And he's squint like crazy. And look at that. There's chief fixin. Oh, and just like just like rose folder almost. Look at that. Come cap on. You know, what does he have more on written all over his face or what? We get so excited whenever he makes an appearance on Zeta 4. It's like we're honored that chief fixin. You know, just his name mentioned it's just I like the fact that he's got such a good sense of humor too. I missed the cowboy hat though. What is her name? Gloria Schwartz. No, I can't remember her name. She's she does the new news on seven. Julie Julie Feldman. Julie Feldman. I said Gloria Schwartz. It was basically. And her sister rose. Yes. That's 92. Order. Yeah okay. Be careful. Who got the hi death? Who is that? Dave's room. Oh, these are more birds. Mm-hmm. In fact, the audience listens very closely. That's going to be probably. We'll just leave that on. Well, let it go for about like 20 minutes. And we'll just hear the sound of the bird. Don't you think that would be a busy that could be part of a new format on this station? I like it. I like it. So anyway, Julie is doing her thing. Her hair is kind of screwed up, you know? She looks all right. I like her earrings. She looks okay. She's got it together basically. I think I think she does. I think she almost looks like she knows what she's doing. Yeah. She almost looks like a guy. If she took the earrings off, she looked just like Mark Williams. Well, see, that's why I like her. I think so. Because she looks boy. Hey, guys, who is just not Goiish and boys. No, Julie Feldman does not look Goiish. Oh, hey, it's good boys. It's I like. You know, that's my look. And you did want to wish on your Jewish friends a happy Passover, right? And happy Easter to all our Goi-em. Mm-hmm. Why is Easter this week? A Sunday. Is Easter Sunday is this Sunday? April 3rd. Yeah. Wow. So happy happy Easter and have Passover and sort of kind of like a holiday weekend kind of sort of kind of yeah. So anyway, those kids from Cooper City are thinking about coming in early, please, you know what I mean? Please, what? Please come in early. Why? There's nothing going on here. Exactly. I mean, this is just in the way. Well, nothing to talk about. Oh, I have lots of things to talk about, but we'll say that till when you're somebody awake listening. It's six. You know, this is awkward. Because I got to like 36 24 till 7 on Zeta 4. This is the deal around you showing a few wondering where all those funny bits are that we usually play in fact. There's a new AC end tape sitting hopefully still in my mailbox. Hopefully. Now that now someone knows where it is. Well, if the tape isn't still there sealed on Monday morning. What happened? There's going to be a four hour devastation of a certain AM station in the other end of that building. That tape is to remain there sealed. Okay. Till Monday. Well, I have a story concerning this and doesn't concern it doesn't concern him. Someone told me yesterday that they were at the with a Richard Cray concert. What was the Robert Cray? Robert Cray. Concert and DJ was there and they ran into DJ at the concert, which is Don Jr. And they met him and after they met him, the guy said to me, he said, I have met Don Johnson. This guy was more obnoxious than Don Johnson. More ego, which is saying a lot. With a bigger head in a bigger mouth. Yeah. That an incredible story. Don Jr. Was more obnoxious than Don Johnson. Yeah. I'll now I think we know why he's Don Jr. That is an incredible story. It has incredible. I could have about 30 seconds. Sorry. It was a long year. You're a favorite channel of course in mine. I spent hours of day watching what's channel 8 of my system. The weather. Oh, my favorite. Can you leave that on for a while? Yeah. Get the current temperature that way. We can basically what we can do is we can give the temperatures for all other parts of the country because it will probably do a couple of minutes on how the weather is in upstate New York. And then Detroit just for you. There's the weather with Don bombs and bright girls. Right. Did they get loose finder Deli and Detroit? It's easy. Well, you know, I think they give a last go weather on this channel. Oh, do they? I think so. I also think they give weather for Iceland. Look at that. It's time for the oyster. If you think word desperate for material, just look at the weather channel. Okay. The oyster harbours. Like a boat in the name. They don't like that term oysters up in Portland, okay. Told you Dennis Foulders. See the wake enough report. Mountain really. In general. I wonder how many people in the audience really watch the weather chart. I think people do watch it. I think quick, you know, short bursts periods because no delays by the way. It's a down there. L.A. X. Yeah, but there's a 43 minute delay in saying, Louis, but who the hell wants to go to San Luis anyway, right? No delay in Denver. And there's no delay in Detroit. Look at this. Which of tall Texas had the wetest march on record while on 24 inches in which of tall Texas and Omaha by the way had the second driest march on record 700.7 inch. I see it's great when you got your TV said and you can rip that's what's great about cable. Man, you've got everything. Don't you? Yeah. You have just a little bit of everything. It's 639 on Zeta 40. Right. That's my house. This is this is an April Fool on us. We're watch relaxing here. We're like laying back on the sofa and just relaxing and God forbid that anybody should be listening to this. Okay. Seriously, could anybody be desperate enough to be listening to us sitting in my living room PS and we're watching TV with the thumbnail. Now we will sound down. Now Neil, we've been wanting to do this for a while. Yeah. What to go through the cable. I've always dreamed of. Yeah. And then of course we get to ESPN. They're probably doing Olympic nose picking on ESPN of this hour tomorrow. Dr. Pull, I hope. They do get into some pretty desperate snow in the morning. They do business. I think they do business. On ESPN. I think so. See, you don't know this because you're at work. See, they do business. Well, see, nation's business today. They do business. In Morning Drive. In other words, if there are guys who hit on the games last night. Seriously, if the guys who hit on the games last night have money to invest, done this part of the ESPN is for them. Right. Right. There's that many. Yeah. That a lot of them. And then they should have like some of the religious preachers on their run noon time because they're going to be heavy like volleyball and stuff. Oh, it knew they do exercises. I know what that was this. Well, fashion is this the scene and fashion show. This is ESPN. Oh ESPN. Well, same defy national business. Okay. Well, let's move right along. Oh, look at my guy probably. We can catch Donahue. We ordinarily are on the air in the station. I'm clapping. We can do a blow by blow. So the. On the Donahue show. There's wall. Cronace. Look at that. Boat. Yeah. Has he got a boat. He and Paul Simon by the way. We're going to run his one ticket. I'll be great. Finally, we're going to get the current temperature. Of course, Walter is going to give us the thumbs up sign if he can ever get his thumb, you know, quite quiet. He'd down long enough to put him one direction. So Wendy this morning here. The Robert, by the way, is rising at 30.08. That's the many a 66% of the winds are out of the east at 16. 72 this morning. Just like I said to him, I any 72 in the beach for Lauderdale is missing and Kendall doesn't want to report. Okay, and I can't say that. This is good. This is just like when the Pope was here last summer. That's right. Just do a little play by play right off the TV. Look at that Walter's thumb is shaking and all directions now. What is his story? We do know him. No, I don't know. Anybody know him. He's one of the unfriendliest people I've ever seen in my life. He was up at the Pompano Park two years ago. When we were all there in the clubhouse that he was sucking up free food and stuff. I mean, people that wouldn't know a horse is front from a horse's ass. Okay. And he was up there with an boy. He's a strange guy. You know, I don't know anyone in the business who knows it. No, I don't know. He's probably people that nobody knows him. Ricky Shaw. Yeah. Because doesn't he do the weather on that station? He knows. Yeah. So he's probably got Waxi build up. Can't hear you. That's why he doesn't respond when you speak to him. But he just he shakes a lot. But I do like the bad times. It's really a nice. I like what he does with this hands. You notice he's always like like, look at that. Did you see the right one there? Yeah. And look what he just did. But we can even federal law prohibits us from repeating on here. But Walter just did Walter plays. Look at that. She's about ready to do a puker. God's not. I don't know her. Now who the hell is she? I do. She got her green card. I don't know. Who is she? Is that he? One thing about these early morning newscastmen. They've got some of the most bizarre like a Julie Feldman that we were watching on seven and glory ellipschits on four of whatever her name is. They've got some really weird people. Who is that woman? I have no idea. Local anchor. I know I did. She looks like she's doing the news from the Indian reservation or something. Doesn't it? Speaking of the Indian reservationers that big story about the Bengal Hall? Yeah, we're going to do that on the news. Oh, are we doing the news if you want? We have no intro or anything. That's okay. 643. Huh? They can run behind you. You can run now. Let's not do it. No, because it's in your city. No, no, no. Yeah, to our studio here. And we don't want them going in over there. Oh, it's locked. Why should today? Is they say every other pass over? Why should they be any different from any other day? Monashana Hall, I love that. She's they can't give it. They can't get the card. They can't get the news. Yes, they can. It's open. It's perpetually open. So the lock was just a ruse. Who's on the board? John Ford is on the board. I'll ask that. I will say again, you can't talk to us. If there's anything we need to know. Yeah, what's going on, John? You can open them. I can speak. How long we gave the numbers on the board? See? I'm right here. See, John, when we gave those numbers out before. Now today lines flash, they were completely like flashing. They're talking to me. The two waken here that. Yeah, this is like exciting. It's like, you sound so awake, John. I need coffee there. Oh, John sounds like he's got that corporate disease. Does need to do you hear that when he was? Yeah. Now listen, don't stand directly under that event in the in our little studio, man, because the S bestos, yeah, your studio is open by the way. Oh, well, you want to go get your mama? I'll get anything you want. It get your mama. It's on the, no, don't get your mama. Just get the cart. Yeah, I'd be going to get my mama. You know where it is? I'll find it. Well, I'll leave right now. I'll go to Hollywood and get my mama. Okay. It's up. Bring her back. I'll be Rogers. Yeah. You probably have some pretty spicy stuff to say today. I have some questions to ask her. I'll bet you do. We'll do that another day. Good. Like, do I really hate her and all that? Good stuff. Would you like the sports section, Dennis? No. Okay. What are you offering him my paper? It's my 25 cents that I went out and he was going through it like he was looking at something like he knew what was going on. There's the guy that's been in the faith. They all look the same. Don't they? He looks like Michael. Well, seven. But this is channeled. It looks like Michael. I bet you it's a twin. It's his twin brother. Maybe when I win him. What the hell is this? Bogus coach. Wait till you see this. You're going to ring out. Bogus coach. And here's one of those old pictures of me where it looks like my head is screwed on my, and that like Leigh Harvey Oslo. You know, with the phony head on the neck. And it says Nearodges. Talk to you. Hosts spars regularly with Cooper City student Alan Dresner. He spars regularly. Don't I wish that Alan, I spar regularly. What are you talking about? Alan's not even here. And he's getting all this big publicity. It says Bogus coach spouts threats against student caller to show. And this is by Marty Rosen. If you're living brown, or you got the story. If you're living dead, forget it because you're lost anyway. Yeah. This is on page two. Broward. It's second page of the browner section. And it says by Marty Rosen. Nice. Glacier name there. Marty says high school student Alan Dresner home on spring break was listening to his favorite radio talk show Thursday morning when a car threatened to have the 17 year old suspended because of his regular calls to the show. Wow. I didn't know that Alan was involved in all of yesterday. What we told that he was in the Bahamas. He was involved. I mean, the whole story is about him. God. Anyway, moving along, it says Dresner knew just what to do. I. I would know. Is that on my phone? That's what I've always wanted to hear was the side of a phone ringing on my show. Anyway, Dresner knew just what to do. I freaked out. I started dialing fast to the Cooper City High School senior who has gained notoriety among his classmates for his daily calls to acid tongue talk shows. Neil Rogers on radio station, Worcester, 94.9 FM. Dresner often is the butt of Rogers jokes, but he wasn't laughing Thursday. No, or dozens of outraged listeners who flooded the switchboard at Cooper City High would complain to the prankster escalated his threats against Rogers fans at the school. Hello. Who was that? Yeah, with pepperoni and cheese, please. The caller who apparently listened to Rogers daily insults and verbal valleys with the teen called on the era second time. Identifying himself as coach Conway at Cooper City High promised to suspend any Cooper City student who called the morning show. There is no coach Conway at the school Cooper City High officials said. Dresner tried to get through the coach got through three times and I couldn't get through it all he said. I'll see how on the problem is the coach wasn't calling on the talk line. I was calling on the business line. That's correct. We put him through on the extension. But Allen doesn't understand what extension means. Dresner, let's say on the third call the prankster promised to suspend any student who even listened to Rogers controversial show. The guy was screaming and yelling that Neil was promoting homosexuality and coming is my couldn't believe it said listener Katie Dela Cruz 22 of Miami. She drove to work and called the highest before complaining. Rogers boss programmed director Dennis Fulger wouldn't comment on the incident. Rogers did not return calls from the Harold. How do I got to return calls from the Harold line at home? Oh, I love the way they do that. Another would I never got any message? What just happened? Now it sounds like we're on the year. I was like real clear. I got real clear. I was just happened all of a sudden. It sounds really good. There was like a half a second of dead air and then it got, oh, now we're switched to pro. Hello. We're on call. Jeremy Coring and here aren't they? This is what calls in some call. This is what calls in Joey gets in a month. Isn't it? That's our third call. Anyway, unsuspecting Cooper City High Administrator Gina Farazo was helping with a switch board when the first calls came in. We had business people calling. We had parents calling. We had lawyers calling. She said some Warren School officials about on air hijinks others complain believing that the school really would suspend students who listened to the show. Sure. Then it got kind of crazy and Mr. Rogers called us. He wanted to know if anybody on our staff named Conway. She said, it's nothing we can don't hear. It's strictly kid stuff. What does that mean? That last line. It's nothing we can don't hear. It's strictly kid star this fogger all I guess. Is that what that mean? That's all incident. So out of that came a major story in the Robert section of the Harold. Good. It gives you a pretty good idea of how exciting this town is for you. Talk about the do of days. We don't have any pens. Okay. My pen disappeared. I know what happened to us. All right. Yes. He's going to have to do that. That's it. Rose, go on. Do something useful. Get a pen. Would you please? So anyway, it's that time. I wonder John has your mama. John, do you have your mama? You don't know. Wait. It's about. What the hell is it? Anyway, it's five minutes before 7655 and Zeta 4. And slowly but surely we're getting our act together. Now Captain Dave is not here today. He's off making 2 million bucks doing a spot somewhere. We're supposed to believe that. And the bird is wandering around. It's just good. It's just like sitting in home and not even doing anything. You know. Now got a number here that we're going to give out. And if there's anybody that wants to call in to my house, it's really like just like calling me at home. Okay. Only tomorrow or like a three in a morning. Now look at this. There's somebody out there with a gas motor. Okay. In our lake. Call up police right now because I think I could be wrong. But I think you can only have electric motors in this lake. And that's the second one I've seen in today's where they're polluting our lake with gas. And you know what's going to happen? All the wildlife in our lake is going to die. Right? So I think we better call woodg the owl. Or when it goes environmental types. In fact, it looked like woodg the owl was kind of hanging out here a little longer. Go to the end. And come up something. Eliscia is going on. But anyway, if you call my house a three in a morning, this number will not ring. It won't. No, in fact, this is probably a number that'll like disappear after this show today. 981, 4772 is kind of brown number. Hollywood number. So that means like if you live in North Dating, probably call it and if you live in brown, up to probably about Pompano. Look at that. And I like that ring. I love it. But this is like this is like art lake letters house party. It is. Hello. Thank you, day. How you doing? Well, this is exciting. Isn't it your my first caller at the house? Swamina least on his phone. Well, I was smart enough to be right by the phone when you gave up the number. Where you were just hanging there like with your thumb out, right? Or something. I was going through my cable the same time. You want to your cable? Where you live? I live in my beach. Oh, my mebeets. So you don't have American cable, right? No, but you know, two four and six and seven and look at that. There's boot runnels with his own body. I can't believe it. And boy, does he look pretty gruesome, doesn't he? Now, this is channel 12. Oh, also don't get down. Now you don't get 12 billion of each. What station is that? Well, I was on beach. What's coming? Now what was 11? We missed what was channel 11. Oh, well, you were busy while we were doing channel 11. That was a TBS in Atlanta, which is a really greeny crappy picture, by the way. So the cable we have on the beach. I don't know who it is, but we don't get as many channels as you guys get. Right. Yeah, we get a million of no, no, there's Mr. Food on channel 10 with his Kiwi fruit. And I think it had a there's Brian or Cros just coming to do the weather too. I can't believe it at the same time. Why see that? Yeah, we get it. There's Brian. He's messing around with the Kiwi. That Brian. And I was kept in Dave's mushrooms. I can't believe it. Boy, he were here today. He was a little peach in the night. 50 grand of our time. We don't get the weather channel. Are you serious? I think that's required on any cables. We don't get our motor cable. Look at the lady on channel 10. Okay, doesn't it look like you want to ask her if he has a green card? Yeah, that's seriously. I've never gave her an answer. And while looking water with his thumbs. Look at that. Oh my god. I know Walter. Do you? I used to work where he lived. He Lane Hume did such rickie ticky twice. Is it really? Is that his real? He has a wife? He Lane. Wow. By the way, after the first three of these cinnamon rolls, we really get to him and I'm great. So anyway, what were you saying? Not that we're not, we're not distracted or anything. Okay? He's to work where he lives. He's a nice guy. Eddie James Olman. Is that Eddie Olman? Man, looks like he got a roadmap on his face. He's got that James Wood. Wow, man. He's got a bit on his face. Now, this is channel 14. This is channel 23. WLTV. I'm sure you get this one. You probably get it about three spots in your kit. What is the, say there's a Mickey Mickey Mouse. Yeah. The mile. Whatever. And this is coming up to my me beach. What's that? That's the one Miami Beach convention. Exactly. Isn't this exciting? It's kind of like we're flipping through our things together, isn't it? Yeah, it is. So what's going on over there on a beat? Now does the show sound is, is ridiculous on a year as it does to us in the living room here? Well, it's windy as you know what? On the beat. Yeah. Was that a response to my question just now? Now let me say it again. Does the show sound as, um, what's the word that I'm looking for? Ridiculous. Ridiculous. Uh, to you listening as it does to us in the living room here. Probably more. Really? That's cool. Where the phone? Did I hear the terrific echo? Well, that's my house. I have a lot of reverb in my house. The guy that lived here before used to work at WADC. That's got immunity used to live here. Just before. That's why the reverb is good. Yeah, but we upon his collection of Beatles songs, man, all over the house. We got Beatles feel like Michael Jackson. You get VH1 on your table. Unfortunately, yeah. No, trust me. You're not misinating VH1. Look at that. It's a Zeus. You get what? A by-now-a-way. The good news is for those of you within the signal area. I'm going to flip a head to a nano go back. MTV is actually coming in like all of it. It's one of the better channels now. Up until a few days ago when I'd bitch them out, it wasn't coming in hardly at all. We just know. It looks like I like it. I don't want to assume that because I carried on and screamed and threatened them with you know, death on the air. Can I be able to somebody? Go ahead of head, soft. You look at that. It's Michelle Jackson. Go ahead. Can I say a little to somebody, even though it's a bit of a while? Why do you, so why do you keep repeating yourself? I don't know. Go ahead. I said, go right ahead. I know this is to the show. What Allen is that? That's not our Allen in Cooper City. This is Allen who I guess worked today, even though he will probably be beating more girly because of the holiday. Maybe we listen to every morning. Because of which holiday now, Passover? Passover. Oh yeah. Well that's over on the beach. That figures, yeah. Which level of the winning crabs is a crotch? Michael Jackson? No, I really don't to be honest with it because it's because you know there's nothing there to begin with. So I even pay any attention, you know. In fact, we understand Michael J. Fox sings in his new movie. He sings, he sings on an old smoothie. Which never have true or has been spoken. Well also, it's been great here from your our virgin collar here at my house. So if we ever get kind into doing this again, you can call us again. Okay. Okay. Have a great day. I was in a scraping like punch up one at a time. Oh that is good. It's WZTA, Miami Beach for Waterdale in the Palm Beach is 701. Here comes another call. One at a time, just like most of the talk shows in this market. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? How are you doing? Hey, this really sounds good, you know what? You sound like you're weighing a time 12 somewhere. What do you mean on the phone around the year? On the phone. How about you? Your sound great. Is this for real though? What? Are you for real at your house? Is this like a... This is an April Fool, but it's on us. Okay. We're at my house. We're in a living room. How could I, how could I be describing what's going on on the TV if we weren't in my living room? And you were, this article was also really in the, uh, in a brown edition. You were you calling from? Plantation. Plantation and you ought to wash out and get 20 copies of the hero to look at a brown section. Wow, I can't believe this is great. I just think it's wonderful. Wait a minute. What is great? You broadcasting from the house. Well, fine. I'll do it every day. Okay. Now that they got it set up, they don't have to come in here. That's for 15 in a morning. It's a little long drive for me. Yeah. I have to get up early. Well, you guys get from. Well, you can set it up at your house, too. I would like that. You know what? Do you remember, you know, I was thinking about the incident at the, at the zoo, you know, when they've had to go to the camp? Oh, yeah. You know, that person, you have to be more than new lodges, roommate to get in here. Exactly. I think he should fix the answer to the door when that person comes to the door today. Okay, that's a good idea. And he's telling the s to be more than a disc shocky to get in the morning. That's, uh, excellent idea. But I mean, more than just a disc shocky to get in an anthoneal house. Slam. And so I have the door in there. Good idea. You're my kind of callers. That'll be about nine o'clock. Yeah. Maybe we can have a liar in here. I don't believe it, but I think it's great. I'll talk to you later. Thanks a lot. Bye, boy. Okay. I like you noticed the way I'm operating that with my toe. Now, do they, it's kind of like having a foot pedal. Do they call that pedophilia? Look at that. Here comes another call on Zeta 4. It's 7 o' 3 or something. Hello. Well, how come I can't hear you? Speak up. Oh, there you go. Hey, welcome to me. I sure am. Okay. What I'd like to know is I am absolutely dying. Are you out in plantation acres? Well, let me put it to you this way. The answer is no, but even if I were, you think that I would tell you one year? Well, and you do it off the air and tell me? I don't do it off the air, man. No, it's not a place to answer. No, I'm not in plantation acres. Why do you ask? Well, the clips of the way you were described in the wild place found here. Believe me, you can go to Windickzien, see wildlife in plantation. I'm not about creatures with pills and people who are exactly that's what I mean. Whoa. Trust me. Okay. Are you following me or did I lose you somewhere? I think I understand your address. Are you in plantation? Yeah, I'm out in the acres. My foot may be in my neighbor. Sorry. Okay. But when you get up into the big leagues, you can move into my neighborhood, okay? Well, where is that? I'll let you know. Okay. See later. I'll let you know. Look at that. There's the doorbell. The phone is ringing. The bell and great part of it is I'm sure the big day is still sleeping soundly. It's a 705 on Zeta 4. Your confused station. Good morning. Good morning. How are you doing? Great. This and I hate to just see you. But I was wondering, got you that trouble yesterday with what they were that jerk was. You did what? Wait a minute. They just delivered you USA today. Who brought that? Somebody from USA today just brought us the paper. Can you believe that that's better than we get at the station? We don't get this at the station. Yeah. It's a better ride to end. Of course, they're so far from the station. Like, where did you cross the street? Okay. Now run at five me again. Yes today. Yeah. I will make a Mac. Mac Nasty called you at the end of the show. Right. Because of the person who called the day before they went to coaching to come out and watch the baseball player. Right. Why was the one who called me to come out and watch him? Well, there's nothing wrong with that. Well, actually the truth is is I'm not really the baseball coach on his lover actually. Oh, you're just a terrible person to come on. Cut that out. You too. Okay. Now we're going to get coach Jr. is going to be calling later on this show. That was just a joke by the way. Okay. Because his lover's out of town. Zeta for hello. Yes. How are you doing? I'm fine. Why is it? Yeah. Go. You're like an accuser. No, I'm in my house. I know that. And we have a tremendous cycle because I've got these big walls and high ceilings and it's going to cost a fortune just to air condition the South's trust. Oh, yeah. You think so? Oh, yeah. No, you know why it's not because I got three separate air conditioners. Okay. You didn't realize that one for each part of the house. Well, so you have no furniture there, right? Yes, we do this. You're come on. Cut it out. You just sit on the floor right against, right? No, we're on my sofa, sir. What do you think I'm some kind of a schlepper? Uh, that's, you know, kind of like, you know, cook your own like that. Yeah, cook, cook, cook. Yeah, cook. Cookie. Now, if you notice we have this new phone system that's all set up here and everything and they can really dust on good, but yeah, and they don't they still don't listen to me. You're not playing. Can you hear the bird? Hi, I hear you hear him? Yeah. But they still are interested in what you have to say. I understand. I'll understand. Now, the original care what he has to say, right? Zero. Zip. Sir. I got a question for you. Okay. Do you see? See what I'm saying? They won't even answer questions about me. I don't blame them to be honest with you. Go ahead. I couldn't even hear you. That's okay. Don't worry about it. Oh, go ahead. So, tell us what you get asked you what? The question you've had. Oh, the question was, can you hear the bird when he speaks to you over there on the other mic? I mean, I can barely hear both of you. Okay. Go ahead. What's your question? Okay. You're in a good place. I love it. Go ahead. Me too. The question is, oh wait a minute. What just happened? Oh, okay. Just go ahead. Take that horrible thing out of our lives or get it out of here. Go ahead. The question is, can you basically recap what happened yesterday on the show? Okay. Yes, I can. What is he doing with his brownie camera and here? I mean, what a groupie. Okay. That you just fill his cap and his brownie camera. That rose bulge or what a comedian. But that's fudb smick. That's what does it for me. Yeah. It didn't for me. It's a good thing. It's close to the John. Anyway, yesterday what happened about 9, 20, I would say is we had, well, first of all, Bob and Harlan from Cooper City. Yeah. We're in the studio. Okay. Right. Be having very wonderfully no problem. We were sitting there shooting a breeze and everything was great. All of a sudden we get this message that there's somebody on the business line who wants to talk to us the assistant principal at Cooper City High alleged. Okay. Right. And I punch it up and this guy comes on. He starts carrying on about this disgusting filth we're doing on the air and about this bad image. We're giving the kids of Cooper City High and I better see Cindy Sistan on and on and on. And got hysterical and I hung up on him and I went through a big song in advance. He called back a second time and basically went through the same thing. And then he called a third time and we put him on. He said, anybody who even listens to your show at Cooper City High, we're going to suspend indefinitely. Okay. He said, we're taking names and addresses and anybody who listens to the show. That's how disgusting it is. We're going to suspend him from school. Okay. Now, I understand you found out who did it. Well, no, let me just put it to you this way that it was not somebody who works in Cooper City High because we called just before the end of the show. And I said, there is nobody by that name here and it had nothing to do with us, it's setter and so on. Right. But I do know who yes, I do know who instigated it. I can't go into what on the air. Okay. Okay. I heard you call it into Cooper City and you're explaining everything. Yeah. And uh, but the same person who instigated the episodes beyond any question is the person who's been hassling and harassing the hell out of us for almost a year now. Does that explain it to you? I can't get any more specific. You've been calling him pain in the afternoon, right? Exactly. Yeah. And Rose is holding her head over here and said, let me say it again. Crystal clear, it can't be a coincidence that all the phrases and all the lines were the same ones that we've heard before. Okay. Covering yourself accordingly. Yeah. Why don't you hint strongly to give us more of a clue for those of us who don't know what. Well, that's not important. Okay. Oh, but I'm losing not losing sleep. It's not it's not anybody important enough to lose sleep over. Okay. Oh, all right. It's no. It's no one from the air. No. No. No. No. Nothing like that. That that's about it. All right. You know what I mean? Well, thanks for the recap there. Uh, gee, I wish I could get the paper and read more of that. But I'm a DJ county so I can't get it. Well, just try it up to hell and they'll have to take care of you. Yeah, right. That'll kill the day for you. Oh, okay. I'll see you at the diplomat mall. Okay. Bye bye. Okay. It's 10 past seven on Zeta 4 now. How are we going to call Captain Dave? Are we going to call if we if I get the line right away? Okay. I got to bend over. Let me give you the weather. Well, this is going on. Mostly sunny today. Hi, New York 80, low to night near 70 at 72. I think we had a dial a one first. A we're in date County. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. We're sorry, too. Seven 11 second work. Boy, you heard the echo in those beeps. I love it. That's call waiting. Do you hear a beep in? Oh, we have call waiting on our lines. Two, that's good. I like that. How come we never heard it during any of the conversations? Is it weather people calling? That amazing. That's incredible. How come he's not picking up the phone? Yeah. What's about it? Because we're not paying him to pick up the phone. Is it it? Yes, he's working. Yeah. He gets paid by the second now. They start early on these. Okay. Well, we'll try him again later that Painted he asked Captain Dave, but we got this is good. Okay. Are we on delay? Yeah, we're on delay. Don't worry about it. John's taking care of all of that back at the station. Right, John? He's right on top of it. Is it a 4? Hello. If he's not it's going to be a hell of a show. Okay. Look at him. He's just got to hang up to this is good. I like this. This is getting beat. See, I don't like all the, oh my god, the calls are pouring in here. And you don't like all these butt-lickers. Hello. Oh, it's the better. Yeah. Good. This is getting to be just like being in the studio. Look at that man. We're going that's 981 4772. We're even getting calls from other radio stations now. You can be sure that. Hello. Morning. Hi. Making a miscugar. Huh? Making a miscugar. What's shaking in the sugar? Isn't that a colorful expression? Pretty stupid, too, but that's okay. That's sugar, but can you say that on the radio? That's about as far as you can go, yeah. That's it. I don't know what that's supposed to mean, but let's not even find out. So what's going on with you this morning? Other than this acid tongue that you've developed? Well, I got two kids, both of them are sick. So I figured I'd get up at 515 and let's see guys on the radio. 515? 515, 545. Yeah. And we didn't come on to like 605, right? Yeah. I got up 20 minutes to early. Yeah, but you did enjoy funeral for a friend. Oh, didn't you? That was an uplifting song for six a.m. Yeah. It almost put me back to late. Yeah. I got to be honest. Yeah, I have to be honest with you. I wouldn't be playing at a six in the morning. That's not... Oh, also went long enough. Yeah. We probably need a longer cut, too. But anyway, moving right along. So the kids got to bug, huh? Yeah, they got to bug. I think four degrees and the other ones got asthma. Wow. No, we either. You're going to have a... you're having a rough weekend. Yeah. Nothing like that. Yeah. Yeah, it'll get better. It'll worry about it. Yeah. This is just part of the growing pains of life. Listen to those birds out there and they're going nuts.

I did. I didn't hear it. Just a little joke. I'm still just going to have a way. So you don't forgive me if I don't get it too fast. That's okay. I just like that said I really enjoy your show and everything. I just wanted to ask you, when did you say you're going to be at the discipline? Esther. It was just a joke, Esther. I'm really entrobable. No, I wouldn't go back to the discipline. I'd have paid me. Okay. I needed what I used to work there. And I felt like never going that, you know, over there ever again. Yeah. It was exciting last year. You know, it had its moments. But that was enough for me. It was actually moments. It's a different matter. I saw all that I needed to see. The most exciting moment was when RJ Intendola kept saying, I can't hear. I can't hear. There's my headphones off, you know. I used to work at a, um, helps us store in the mall. And my excitement was just selling all that yogurt everybody from then, you know, from how they was the moment of my life. Yeah. I love the way they're bringing their brown paper bag. Don't you have an old coup on said they don't think you read the little crunchy, the expired, you know. Yeah. I'm going to go to the goodies out to go in and get a little glass of tea or something. I open their brown bag and get out there. Must you're in their mayonnaise and, you know, spread their sandwich meat. And it's great. Yeah. It's terrific. I know. It's like, oh, we stand in myself. If I ever end up doing something like that, I should be put out of my misery. Amen. You know, I just, I see it all the time because I know, I used to work in my Me too. It's for the same chain and other malls. And I used to see the same thing. I said, I've had enough. Yeah. You know. I don't blame you. Anyway, I want to take too much of the time over there. Have you moved in? Yeah. How do you like it? It's great. Believe me. In fact, if we can get these, you know, people from the radio station out of my house, it's going to be great. You're perfect, huh? Yeah. Well, I just want to say again, I really enjoyed showing it. And thanks for talking with me. Okay, Esther. Have a good day. Well, I boy. Well, I hope she catches up some day. She's a little behind a few things. Maybe you helped her because she skipped a semester. Exactly. That's the problem with Esther. I knew they had to be an explanation. 728 on Zeta 4. Hello. Oh, that's good. Short but sweet. I like that. Can we go to the bunch of those this morning? That made them the best one. I want to why that is on one line. Doesn't it? Streckey is being rather bizarre. Seriously, because we have six lines of the station, right? Hello. Hey, Neil. Yeah. Hey. This is great.

It's not bought. It's only least. I like my car. I still wish the good luck with it. I least everything, sir. I'm only for a couple of hours. But I least it all. Well, listen, have a great weekend. Okay. You too. I think I'll let it in. And eat some hollow. Would you? I like to be stopped. What do you do is there that pregnant pause when I said eat some hollow. I don't know what made me say that. I don't know. Maybe every in hollow pots like eating the herald. No. I have. Seriously. It's like eating paper. Really? Hello. Why can't I say it's like eating paper? Are going without the eat? No. And what is this? Is this the time tunnel? Well, we do know we're on the air. Yeah, that's good. We want to recall like that. So we can double check her. And make sure that we weren't getting that. Dining them effect. Yeah. The Dining from joke. Yeah. You sure he didn't live in this house at one time. Could be.

You know what they say? One good bird deserves another. Look at that. Well, he knows he knows who his friends are, doesn't he? And if I were you, listen to that. If I were you, I'd be very conscious because big days have been having problem with that bird last couple of days. What kind of problem? Hello. Yes. I can come to know if you have a dumb. Yes, we do. Are you? Why? Why do you ask that? Why do you ask that? I just wondered if you did get what if someone called it something. Because they already did and didn't get on the air because we're on delay. But John Ford man is a sharp as a moths of all that year. And he won't let it happen. Okay. Oh. Are you going to get food today? How are we going to get it? They've already delivered the breakfast from TJ Sittamans. May we got enough rolls in here to feed the Chinese? Who called you today? I thought you'd eat and talk to a little boy. That was Joey Reynolds. That's like my two favorite cards for sure. I know mine too. Like, Colin is my favorite caller. Who? Yeah. Harlan's great. He is great. He's my favorite caller when you eat. And he's going to be here too, by the way. Wait. Little later, Bob's going to be here Michelle and Harlan. Maybe the taro will come along too. Well, let's not go crazy.

Is this incredible or what? With this thing going like the rest of the show, we can kill 3.5 hours. Speak. Talk. Say something. Anything. Even if it's. She just freaked out. See, the thing is so far away, I guess. Maybe if I pick the speaker phone up and put it up on here. Yeah. And then they can't hear me even better. I have to do it with my feet. Hello. Hi. Can you hear me? Yeah. We are on a delight thing. Yeah. We're on delay, man. You can hear it on a radio, but it will be like 4.5 seconds later. And you get all freaked out. Are you? Yeah. Let me tell you something. Yes. I just called 10 minutes ago. I'm like so excited that I can get through that I have to call again. I don't understand what you mean by that. You called 10 minutes ago and I spoke to you. Yeah. And you're calling me back 10 minutes later? Yeah, no. We just love you so much. Thank you. Well, it's nice hearing for you, but I don't overdo it. Okay. And enough is enough. Do you believe it? That's against the rules. So again, star law. That's against the law. I can't do that. I'm glad that she loves this and all of that. And I look at that. Look at that bird over there outside. Is it getting ready to come in? Oh, yes. There's like something out of an Alfred Hitchcock movie, isn't it? I'm just converging in my house. Oh, the song. Yeah. She called back. She's probably getting tested. Nineteate one, four seven seven two. That's the number. Nineteate one, forty seven seventy two. And don't get all excited about this number after today because today only. You're probably reached Joe's pizza or something. Hello. Hi. Hi. How you doing? Hi. Make him over news your book.

But Houston Airlines has been screwing me up. Really? What are they doing? Well, they over-put me. On the first Wednesday night and last night they just cancel the flight. Great. No, I'm still trying to get out of this crazy town to get some Italian pasta for the weekend. I don't blame you. Well listen, good luck to you. See you in Naples. And you can't make it to Italy.

It is pretty frightening. You have to time it for the space before they hang up. Yeah. Well, you've got it down pat. Yep. You can do like that lady before you can call about 20 times. Yeah. Well, you know, I just might do that. I'll just keep on calling you. Wasn't that great? She was so excited that she got through the ten minutes later. She just felt compelled to call back again. I know. She find out straight. I mean, I'm not putting her down because she's a, you know, a real groupy and loyal and all of that. But let's get serious. Yeah. I don't like she was exciting enough to call for a time. No, like maybe maybe next Easter, like a year from Sunday. Yeah. Well, you're not here. I'll leave helicopters going over my house. No, it's better fact. I can't hear any of them. No. Well, they're doing no literary exercises over here. Something. I like to watch those military exercises every honestly. Especially pushups. There you go. Okay. Well, it was good to talk to you now. Okay. Glad you got through. Have a wonderful holiday because it sounds like you're really into it. All right. I'm so enjoyed. I can't believe it. Okay. Have a good one. Bye bye. Okay. At 7.30's 8 on Zeta 4 and let's see. We don't have another break till I have to do this. So we can just keep taking these calls. Hello. Hello. Hi. Hi. I'm carrying. I'm calling always. What's on these? Are you serial Terry? Wow. You mean you're spending your own money for it? Yes. That's great. That's that's real loyalty. Okay. I was to see guys as we're in the morning. Fantastic. Great. You're right. That's that. So how does it sound for my house, Terry? It sounds good. Does it? Yes. Do you want one of those in a compound? No. We got a whole thing here, man. It's just stuff hanging from the ceiling and the walls. It's great. I am. It was listening to you. I guess it was so day. No. Wednesday morning. I was like five minutes with work. Yeah. And I think you guys mentioned substance. Not substance. Not substance. Not substance. Yes. Oh yeah. I've had some real problem with them. Yeah. I worked for them. I can't less pause. Really? You want to know why they're working. Did you guess? Well, because they just don't feel like coming all the way out here for a measly hundred bucks, you know, more than once a week, I guess, is their story. Not substance is terrible. Yeah. They really are. They absolutely were. And any guy didn't even get. He didn't even stick around to make sure the pilot was, but I realize it, you know, he's not compelled to do that. But he does realize that we've had all this problem keeping this pool heated and he came out here and he just took off in a half. Like he was indignant that he had even come out here again from my measly hundred bucks. And we're still waiting to try to get fired up against. So hopefully the pool people are coming by today. And with any luck, we'll get the pool heated again. Hey, how did they get out there? Hey, listen, I, I feel like I live over there in David. Okay, with that trap again. I talked to them the last five days, maybe 20 times, okay? And they just, they got a difficult time getting their act together. And she says to me, you're putting a tremendous strain on our resources. What kind of, what kind of a business is that that we, you know, one lousy house here with one thankful a gas is putting a tremendous strain on their resources. That's terrible. Those people are bad. I can't believe they shot that. Well, you see the hamster died that, you know, keeps the truck going. The hamster died, so they had to go out and get a new one. It's a kid one. It is. I am.

Yeah, so it was funny. I turned on joy, Relsia, the more I don't know why. And it's really not you sitting there and saying, I'm funny. I'm funny. And you know, you was a funny person. Well, you know, he doesn't think that, but he, he believes that if you keep saying it long enough that you're going to start believing the big lie. Yeah. And he's been saying it for about 75 years that he's been on the air. And not only doesn't the audience believe it, but even he doesn't believe it. And I can tell away he's trying to convince himself, but it just isn't flying. I like the bird. Yeah. But now I think you guys got a really good show. And I was in the every morning. Great.

Let's get into the, it's a four to express way. Let's say. Yeah. What about Twitch Magazine, sir? Okay. Twitch Magazine is a new old music video of Florida.

You could use your hand for a map when referring to the state. You could use your hand for a map? Yeah. Well, you say, like, you know, if you're looking at your right hand, I lived in Detroit that be close to the sun. Well, I see for Michigan, you mean? Right. Yeah. That's true. How does that relate to Florida? Well, in Florida, you don't use your hand. Well, you got it. We can't federal law prohibits us from saying it on the air, but you can just kind of look at it.

Hey, why don't you just wait like 20 or 30 seconds to play out? Hello. That's a good idea. Because people are listening off the radio, right? Yeah. I never thought about that. Well, that's good. And you got right through, right? No. I'm right. Fifty times. Where are you calling from? My name. Oh, for Miami. That's why. Man, I'm telling you.

Good bill for Portland, man. And if anybody deserves what they do, they've taken years off my life. I know that. You can't hear that. I'm not radio. You can't. You can't? No, not in the radio. When you're on the phone, man, it sounds like we're in this gigantic, this mammoth tunnel. Yeah. In a big cavern, right? Yeah. I guess. Okay. Okay. I kind of be part and quickly there, didn't they?

And if you have any help, you can pay for that was being. No, they can't afford to give any stuff away with it. Um, you crap like that. Yeah. Yeah. I think what they're trying to do is just because you brought us from your house today. They're trying to get as close as possible. I believe, but yeah. Yeah. They're broadcasting the plantation. You're still getting it to gas station and an open, I think, in a competition way, but it didn't work those times. It's an act right. I understand a Johnny Darts doing a show from his house later on.

Is that under the trip line or your roof? Yes. Yeah. Oh, the water pour into it. No, no, that's not what a pilot like goes out. It's just going out because when we light it, it doesn't stay on. Okay, but if it is under the drip line, it'll keep going out. It's rust outside and all sorts of stuff like that. That sounds good. Oh, uh. Probably too many drips in this house, huh? At least, at least one anyway. Well, I think you're right. I think you got the right number. Okay. Listen, have a great weekend. I think you're right. I think you got the right number. Okay, listen, have a great weekend. Thank you. 802 on Zeta 4 isn't that something we learned something every day. We got to move that thing out from under the drip line. Wow. Maybe we would get somebody out here who knows how to work the pool heater. Okay. How about these guys? Do you know what I think about pool heaters? I don't know. Didn't know about anything this morning. Only eating. You're sitting there like so quietly. Are you sucking up the food? Oh, yeah. There's a lot of food too much of it. Did I call you over here?

And that's, I had no opinion really about him one way or the other until Monday. He said he were a douchebag and a mung brain right up. Not sure. Yeah.

You're going to see about your interest yesterday. You want to give up your interest. So everybody can move your house. You're going to call him and wish him congratulations or something. Make up with them. Did you hear him say anything just now? I didn't hear a word. I can hear you. It's just that there are certain individuals who are no longer discussed in this show. Oh, I didn't know that. Oh, yeah. We don't we out the deal with people who have like in the minus column. We don't deal with those people. We're the HC story. You keep on talking about it.

You can go over and see the people from not so hot 105 over there. But the ice cream store that you're talking about is on university at the 44th Street. Oh, I know what that is. That's how we're talking about. Can corals bring this one distance to the number? Of course, because it's a Hollywood number. Howard, why not fools, you know? I don't want to be overrun by people from corals. Because there's some real psychotic people up there. You know what I mean? We're not the ones from Michigan though. No. You listen.

But I had a feeling, and nobody at Cooper City would behave like that. Maybe a terror fellow, but not a Cooper City. Oh, no, I was terrible. I figured that Walter's might call you up for an interview. Barbara? Yeah, Barbara Walter's like a child. So, um, have you ever been on the John Lodge? Oh, yeah. I'll tell you something.

Coach Conway in the bird. Yeah. This sounds like one of Alan's. That's an issue on CBS this fall. By the way, Coach Conway in the bird. Guys, no idea what's going on. Yeah, this is Alan. What about his fans? No question about it. Why are you trying to talk over him? Oh, I thought he could hear me. How old are you, sir? 16. 16. You old young man and you're trying to talk over him. How was he going to expect for your younger? I respect that you got. Exactly. I was trying to tell him something. What was that? That this sounds like a quintessential Alan fan. Yeah. And no idea what's going on. He is. He's in love with Alan. I mean, not literally, but like figuratively, right, sir? Yeah, I only listen to the show in the morning. Because I have to go to school. Yeah. And I'll say, you might go talk to the show. And he's show me the pace when he show me what happens. Yeah. I was wondering what he's doing. Well, the amazing part of it is that it was Harlan and Bob who were on the show of me and Alan couldn't get through on a phone, but somehow Alan got all of the press. And he got a hell of an agent down. You know, he really does. I think William Morris must be booking him. You know what I mean, sir? Yeah. I'm sure you know, no idea. You don't know William Morris from Arthur Morris. No. From Wayne. Joe Morris. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Now, what Alan's fans? This is it. I've been waiting for this. Yeah. He's a giant fan of this show.

Because this party is for the purpose of corrupting the morals of the interests of the people, and the use of the law. Okay. Okay. They're not reporting to certain idiots in this town. Exactly. We have to see Cindy's system govern ourselves accordingly, okay. Right? You? Yes. Hey, don't join your anybody. I haven't talked you the long time. Yeah, hey, Ben. All right. Listen, I want to take all things first. Wait a minute. Look at that. It's Elsie the Borden Cow on my face. That I can't believe it. a couple weeks ago I was on my way to Palm Beach. I couldn't get you guys on the radio site hooked over the Joey in there. Incredibly starting to feel another one of your materials. I started to do his IDs and Spanish that can you breathe. What do you mean you couldn't get us on a radio? I was on a tour of like the West Palm is walking you know I was going past there and to stay the home on my way to St. Lucy County and starting to fade away. I was just trying to freak out right through it over at Joey. I couldn't do it right through your paintings. I couldn't believe you used your IDs and Spanish. Yeah he's a regular man I've done him. And speaking of a original there's a place in Palm Beach still a number one of your rights in a banner is a Palm Beach race and it's just in credible. Right. Yeah, great. The way it's just I'm now seeing a baseball season around the corner. Who do you pick when he has divisions? Who do you like? I'll give you about a week. Oh, I'm still. Once the final four or over this weekend and I can get my mindset on baseball. Okay. And finally listen to some guy a couple weeks ago, call and said he was from BCC and said it's a list of a few people listening to your stuff. This guy number one didn't say which which college was he from you know the three of them around here. And if it's the one where I'm going to improperly it would make no sense at all because I told you about that semester when they play a Y100 they play a Joey. They play great. And I'm not one to buy her an a record from GTR now. It's supposed to be so great why are we here in that crap on the radio. How do I GTR understand is moving their studios to the joys our us store over on where is that on four point one? Right next to win, right? Perfect. Perfect. I think there will be C C win more of that GTR. In fact, they're bringing back Francis Horowitz. They're going to have a show in a morning called Bing Bong school. All right. The listeners, thanks for having a great time again into a moment of vacation. So I'm a good week at D-letterberg. Okay. I didn't know it was a momentous. I mean, isn't that disgusting the idea that they were doing that they're your drug station? Yeah. That they were doing a show from a head shop. When they were selling paraphernalia like torches and bongs and stuff like that. Disgusting. What? Yeah, that's Dave over there. Yeah. Big Dave. Yes. Oh, we have another call here. Hello. Hello. Hi. Getting back to the pool. Yes. Yes, man. Yeah. The reason you're pilot by the B-reets, I don't like won't stay there. Yeah. Is because your whole filter could be dirty. The filter could be dirty. Yeah. How thorough is your pool man? How can clean your filter and then try to pilot light? Well, that's not pretty unlikely because they just put in a whole new filter last week. Okay. Well, then that won't be the problem. No, but that is helpful. Yeah. What fell a question for you? What is Captain Dave a captain of? This show. Yeah. He used to be the captain of this show before you abandoned the ship. All right. Well, you have a nice day. Okay. Thanks for the help. Bye. Bye. Bye. Yeah. We have a really got a lot of constructive help on the pool situation. Now we had a couple of calls today, but these people don't know from pools at all. Anyway, because 85, well, I'm kind of swept up in all the emotion of what's going on around here, you know? Yeah. Now these engineers, these guys are going to have to be here like until seven o'clock and I just think now you guys are going to be out of your minds. Okay. You'll let them talk to you into this. Yeah. So I'm serious. If I would have known that it would have required this kind of slave labor, I would have said forget it. I mean, we're having, it's okay. But yeah. This is ridiculous. Or the idea just doing the morning show. That would have been okay. 10 o'clock and the guys, you know, stayed back at the station because it doesn't really mean for anything, doesn't? I will see. I can't think of anything. By the way, Bob was just on his way to give me some more dietary seven up in my refrigerator in there. Thank you so much, Bob. I'm not looking at that. He's with a smile and everything. Oh, yeah. That's what we like. Service with a smile. You know what I mean, Helen? It's 26 past eight. Yep. To take a break or oh wait a minute. No, we don't have to take any break. We have to take a cool. Okay. Let me just look at the rest of the log that they brought us backward. Must be because it's Passover and I think we're reading the log in Hebrew. Seriously, from right to left. Hello. Oh, Neo, hey, don't like. Great. What's up? Oh, no, too much. It's just talking to a friend of mine. He's in the office. He says he showed you once before. Who's that? Then in Vince Montcaley used to manage a guy named Finn Barnawan. Oh, my god, the touch healer. Yeah. I can't believe it. Boy, I haven't heard from him. That was years ago. That was about six seven years ago. He said he was a seven son of a seven son. Exactly. And Johnny Rivers was singing it in the background on tragic one or two point seven. The seven son. Now that's true. He was the touch healer. And he used to put his hands on you and touch you and stuff. Wow. And I kept telling him. In fact, that's where I learned that technique. He kept just putting his hands on you and the touching and squeezing and feeling. Hmm. So how much what's what's this party you have in the house next? Thank you very much Bob. You're oh, wait. I don't want to put my cigar in her yet. That comes at the end of the show. What is that, sir? What's what do you have in the house next week? What do you mean what's with it? I want to find out how I can get invited. You can unless you're a student at Cooper City High. You can't get invited. You want to go back to school? Not a student at the city high, but I'm a friend of Captain Dave. Now that that assures that you're out. Okay. He shyness again today. I know he I spoke to him last night. Okay. Now wait a minute. Are you now you're the one not the one who can't call and put on a false set of voice before we call to make sure that I was awake? Oh. What's he doing today, do you know? He told me he's doing some type of commercials. Yeah. Make his 20 grand a day. Oh, I don't know about 20 grand. But what he said 20 grand? I think that is members of the morning team that each of us ought to get a third. Well, actually I'm going in from my piece too. You'll meet too if I can find one. Well, it's an ever great weekend. You too. And I'm sorry we can't invite you, but it's kind of a closed party, you know? Yeah, here. What advice did the listeners party a couple of weeks after that? We're going to have the whole audience over here. Okay. I thought of a very nice gift to give you. I'm afraid to ask. Alan. Thank you sir. You're invited. Okay. See you later. How that gets you upset, doesn't it? Do I look upset? I suppose suppose Alan we're here today right now. Okay. I went through the kitchen down the hallway where you know those bedrooms are on the end and I gave him a private tour of the house. And got him out of your hair. That would be good. And I stayed in here with him for like an hour and a half. Teaching him about life. Uh-huh. Would that be okay? Boy talk about fantasy land. This is good. I like this fantasy land. Trust me. Okay, and in matter of fact, we ought to put that tape on. Yeah, let's pull that off for a second. Do something useful. They put that cassette in there please. And I know that you look very relaxed and at ease, but you're not full of anybody after your last night. Just push that in there. We can freeze frame when terror comes on, right? And where's the remote? Oh, gee. Right. I'm getting much notice. Two old for this. Yeah, now maybe you can do a play by play on this. This is the, um, I think we got a rewind to doing. Probably probably you're probably in such a shop that you didn't. Are we a saw ready? We want. Is it rewinding? I can't see from here. The sun is in the, well, the little light is flashing. There's a little square and it's a little winding. Harlan. It's not. There's a little square white square that's flashing. It'd be broken. Wait a minute. Fair comes. Here. Okay. Did it say play on on my screen? I don't see anything. There we go. Okay. Just keep your paws off my VCR. Okay. Off my very expensive VCR that's least by the way. I don't buy anything. I just lease. Even the groceries here are least. I know that. It's incredible. I think we have to go back on it. So, okay. I think we have to back up as they see a two-person city. Well, this is worth waiting for. I'm sure. Okay. It's 830. According to the time thing on my screen. I was in that convenient. We're sitting here watching the VCR for those of you who are wondering what all the dead areas are. But we do have, we have Twiti to fill in the blank series. Got his own mic. He knows what to do. Yeah. And he's been doing it all over the bottom of the cliff. On another story. Twiti. He's so cute. Isn't it rewinding, Harlan? Nothing is happening. I think I didn't do it. No, wait a minute. I'll probably because it's on wrong thing here or something. I don't understand it. I think somebody messed up your tape. Wow. This is incredible. We've already, we've only been here two and a half hours. They've already busted my VCR. It looks like it's rewinding to me, isn't it? It's what? It's at the end. Oh, wait a minute. See, now you got me all screwed up. There, I press play. Okay. Well, I'm sure the audience is getting into this really heavily. Okay. It is rewinding. Okay, press play. He said, I press play and not a damn thing is happening. Huh? I have it on 12. Yeah. Shouldn't it be on three? I don't understand it. We got to, well, listen, you're going to have to fill a couple of seconds. Oh, no. Oh, my God. I just understand it. Unbelievable. Pressure. What do we we got it? All right. Yeah. I only had to fill a couple of seconds. Here it is. Here it is. Okay. Look at this. It's in color and everything. Wow. 832 now on Zeta 4. It's worth. Others. Someone at the door. Could that be KC? It could be KC. You never know. We're at Neals home in plantation. When it was something of a KC right in the middle of this unbelievable. Yeah. Oh, it's somebody who wasn't even invited and that would be, is this by any chance Neal Rogers? How is who is that out there? Are listeners? Yeah, it's a listener out there. They found it. What does he look like, Bob? What happened? Was he ugly, huh? Okay. There's any ugly people by the way. I think in a crashing party forget it. Now let's get back to the video tape. That's Laura. Laura. Laura's pretty good, right? She sure is. How come the kit? What? The plantation. City plantation public works department. I mean, you tell you the part of once you didn't know that they found it. Thank you. And by the way, we got some garbage that we'd be more than happy for them to take. And that's who that was. And the gay rise. Unbelievable. There's terror right there in the white jar. They're doing her thing. She really looks extra good in there. Yeah. Oh, thank you so much, Bob. Just go pick up the garbage and cut the crap. Okay. It's 833 on Zeta 4. We're sitting here watching. We're sorry that the audience can't share in this, but this was the Monday and Tuesday night fashion show that we could attend attend. That we unfortunately couldn't attend because I was that you had no excuse, but I was I wasn't in there. What do you mean? We were six. That was true. That's good. Heaven. That's been a long story. That was a good issue. And Harlan and Bob actually are on this tape too. And there's Bob, right there from the neck down, looking excellent from the neck down from the neck up. And but that's another story. Who's that? Is that your date for the prom? That's Jordi. Is that Jodi that trust me? You won't go wrong with that, Harlan. Believe me. My eyesight's very good. Is Jodi in here that? But how come it is that all the kids at Cooper City are so good looking? Now that's the thing I don't understand. The exception of Mark Schwartz. Seriously, now Mark looks like he's been auditioning for bedtime for Bonzo. Now that there's another ugly guy to who's at? Victor's not too hot, but Victor means well, you know. But other than Mark and Victor, like the rest of the student body over there is incredible, we don't want to get a coach a douchebag to get upset though because you'll hear us talking about those hot student bodies, listen, that we have plans. He's listening boy. Who's that? Oh yeah, Tina Turner. So anyway, what takes more calls, I guess, while we'll have this going in the background, just as kind of a little incentive. Phone's not ringing. Isn't it not because it's not plugged in? Well, we unplugged it, so go ahead, Harlan. Are you in the right you need to touch it? There it is. You can touch it. You need to touch it. Let's plug it in. Let's plug it in. Let's plug it out. Hello. Good morning. Well, I don't have my headphones on. Wait a minute. Yeah, good morning. How are you doing this morning, L. K. I've been ringing this phone for the last 10 minutes. Traveling on 95 with no traffic this morning because of a great holiday today. Oh, yeah, nice every day should be a holiday shouldn't it? I'm fine for that. 100% I think 365 days a year would be great for me. Yeah, I want to congratulate you on finally finding my favorite packet restaurant up there a lot of time. Oh, man, that place is so incredible. Is there not a range of no words to describe it? No, you're going to have to get a... Who, wait, wait a minute. Sir, hold on. Who's this guy? The delay goes back to his home and he's out with his. Steve, it's Emily. That's Steve who calls me sometime there. Holy cow, Steve can call me anytime. Go ahead, sir. We're watching something you're getting all the way. We have similar types of tastes. I want you to go to one of the best Chinese restaurants in the state of Florida. What is that? Oh, the bamboo garden. And we're at least 60 surgery across the shopping mall. I'm going to try it because we keep getting touted on Chinese restaurants in most of Marseille Bay that it's embarrassing. It takes my word for this. I'll pay for you meal if you don't like it. It's 163rd and where? And you're across the street, 160-3rd street shopping, sir. We call the bamboo garden. Yeah, see Paul. Oh, Paul, I recommend that you. That Paul man, he's like an every rest of. There's Harlan, by the way, just making a total clown out of himself. Okay, we'll give it a try. Stop being up on Harlan, isn't it? He is great. Back there, when this show is over, I got special plans for him that he doesn't know about yet. Well, Paul, I'm jealous of it. I bet you are. Listen, I'll see you this time. I'm a super day. I'm losing, uh, we're changing sell here or something. But I'm losing you. But anyway, a lot of finally got through to you. I was great show and I enjoyed this in the every single morning. Thanks a lot. I'll see you on Tishabov. Okay. We got it, Bob. Bye bye. Okay, let's pull it out Harlan again or Andy or somebody just to pull the phone out before it rings again. Now, because we're getting to the good stuff here and you were beginning to make guttable sound. Oh, I saw a good one. A good one. A good girl. You saw a good one. What would have a class? This disgusting. No, not such, it's just a, this, this, like these people are pieces of meat or something. Okay. Well, was that proposed? I waited to see Alan here. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, well, I'm going to miss that. Now, you will because he's only under very briefly. It'll be placed without, now what did he do? Do we do it back here? Did you see that? Find a little grab ass back here behind the couch. Michelle and Bob trust me. Rebecca, you might want to turn around and watch. But it's reminiscent of Don Webb and Joey on TV. No, only this is a little more exciting. Who is that? Leslie Leslie. How, what do you say at that way? I mean, Leslie does not be okay. Oh, this is the power we have the bathing. Oh, my. Now, there's a guy named Jimmy by the way who comes on here. Who is that? He wants to know who that is. The one that's got all our clothes on. I mean, talk about us being pornographic. Look at these Cooper City kids, man. Right. They're like naked. These are high school kids. Oh, my. Oh, my. Now, if you just want to know that this was going to be on Monday or two, they even with your little infirmity that you had. You might have made it up to this. I didn't make it. Yeah. Man, I've gotten there somehow. Exactly. You might have had somebody drive you up there. That girl on the left. What a suit. He's got all the right parts and all the right places. What a bathing suit. Isn't that a name of a country song? Looking for all the right parts and all the right place sounds like it. Yeah. Tweety's just, uh, even Tweety bird got excited. Look at that. Look at that. Look at this. Something happened to him. I'm afraid, uh, I wonder what it is. Who's that? The guy. Tommy, and the girl. The audience is loving this man. I can't see any of this, but they wish. Just fantasize for a while. Folks, this is the, uh, the Deca fashion show at Cooper City High. If I were to know, and I would have probably been able to get over there. You know, Bob, you called us and tried to get us over there. Didn't you? Yeah. Yeah. You did your best, Sam. And we wouldn't listen to you. Oh, that's, uh, who? Oh, you mentioned a name that we can't imagine. Oh, who is this kid here with, uh, uh, all his clothes off? Jimmy. Yeah. And who's the other one there? Jimmy and Steve. And look what Jimmy and Steve are doing there together. As a matter of fact, that's pretty exciting. Did you know that you two mornings on she? Jimmy and Steve, yeah, before a Joey. Mm-hmm. And they're doing the same thing with each other to Joey and Don Webb. We're doing, I can't believe that. Okay. We better put the phone back in because this is getting pretty, uh, terminal. For the audience. Not for us. Not for us at all. Let me give that number out. 981 4772. That is our, oh my god. Like I said, let's not put that thing back in there too fast. Good. Who are those people? What is his name? Elliott. Is Elliott coming to our party next weekend? These kids today. Boy, oh boy. Holy, Toledo. Hello. Oh, how you doing? I'm just fine. It's still a candle. How are you guys? Hey, and Kendall, you had to call long distance, right, Bill? No problem. Okay. I didn't ring it for a long time. Doesn't cost me a set. That's for sure. In fact, if I hung up on you now, look what a cheap call it would be. Yeah, but it's worth it to me. Listen, how's Glenn doing? I'm fine, sir. How are you doing? I'm doing just fine. Wow, there's a lot of echo this morning. Yeah, is that great? Is that good? Yeah, it's a second time. Just 60. Yes, that's right. Exactly. It's exactly. Yes, today. Great show. I got to say Neil. Yeah. When you thought that it was a legitimate call, you handled it great. I thought so, yeah. I was really impressed. I loved it. Great. Just once take a morning. I'm enjoying the show. And have a good day. You too. Oh, oh. Bye, bye. See, once you did, you know, he was not going to spend a much money from Kendall. I look at that Jimmy there. Looks like he's got saying by his dance or something. Or something close to it. Hello. Hello. Hello. Yes, sir. I'm talking Neil. You've got him. Are you doing Neil? Wait a minute. Is that Elliot sitting down over there to the right? Boy, that Elliot better show up at that party. Yeah, next week. Elliot. Elkie? Oh, Ellie. What does that mean? Oh, oh, oh. OK, is it a whole Thomas? Yeah. OK, I'm sorry, sir. I was getting very carried away. That's OK. You got to talk when I posted to that speaker phone. OK, how's this? Better. Yeah, I'm much better. OK, how about now? All right, that's even better. How about now? Yeah, that's even better. OK. How you doing? Good. That's the going over there. It's OK. Hello, Ellie. Keep in line. Everything's under control. And the kids are hanging out in the bedrooms and everything's fine. That's a good day. Hey, I can get a bird back there. Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I want to see you do that again. I want you to stick your figure. Now, this is good. OK, 20. Come on. I'm no. No. I want to see you stick your finger in the cage. OK, where's Alan when we need him? Oh, go ahead, sir. I'm sorry. I'm getting a, it's a cockatiel if you pardon that expression. Uh, one of the little ones with the feathers sticking out of his head. Uh, you got it. Yeah. The very, very good way to describe it. How's the other bird doing? Well, we're hanging out together. Tweety and iron. And they speak the same language. Yeah. We have a lot to talk about. A lot of stories. And they both dislike Alan with a passion, with a passion. Tweety and iron going to be together next weekend. He's coming down to my house for the weekend. Good. Well, I'm glad that's a company you're going to have because I have something a little more exciting in mind over here. Anyway, Neil. Yeah. Yeah, this is great. I just wanted to wish you a happy Easter and everything else. Good. And the same to you. And I hope you find the egg of your choice on the lawn. No, no, no, no. Or whatever. Whatever it is you're looking for. All right. See you later. Take it easy now. 842 on Zeta 4. And I this true, he just gets all popped up. And maybe winning his affections away from big Dave. And it's ordinary. That's the only person he pays any attention to. Tweety. He's had some rather intimate moments with big Dave. What we heard about that in the next hour. Hello. I just don't have a controlling contest. Yes, we are, sir. OK. Joe. Oh, yeah. Very weak. Come on. Very good. Better than that. Try it again. Yeah, I think. Yeah. So cut. There we go. I knew he could do it. Oh, that was actually much better. I wish we had a prize to give you. Maybe we'll give you like Sergio Pereira. Oh, wow. OK. Or maybe Jorge Valdez. OK. Jorge. You have the so far campaign going. How is it going? Yeah. Well, so far, so good. Yeah. OK. Right. How you doing? All right. Yeah, I like you. You're right on the money, man. You're right up to the top of it. I like that. I like it. And you're writing a, they're writing some amendments to the Constitution. Yeah. And when I have them all finished, we'll let you know what they say. OK. OK. Good luck to you. Right. I think that we ought to listen very closely to what he has to say. Don't you know, tweety? Twitter. Yeah. I think some of the most meaningful comments at the morning have come from there. I'll even leave it in. Because what are we doing? 844? Yep, do you think so? No, I don't think we, well, I think I'm going to drop a girl to call her now. Is that OK? Yeah. So how should I say, let me get it for you? John, I'm just going to do this all by itself. So don't go into a hot land or anything, but I'm a little confused as to what we're doing. Which is nothing unusual, right? Why should today? Anyway, if you want the bird selections for Trapper哥 to call her, you're going to get them exclusively on Zeta 4. Now, he did his first one on Thursday, the horse. Horse came in last by 28 land. And he picked one yesterday in the second race, which fortunately for him got scratch. Yeah, I'm doing great. So he's one for one. And what was the name of that horse? What is this queen? Bruce the queen. Bruce the queen. I may be Bruce the queen is running today. I'm going to go there. Go there. OK? It's a joke. I'm going to be on that show. Are you sure this is working out? Because I can't believe nobody is calling us. Oh, it's all right. Or do I have to turn that off? And then back on, are you cereal? I don't think so. 981, 4772. Hey, listen, what do I do? I can't go to argue with the engineers, right? Maybe we ran out of calls. Is that possible? I don't think so. No. There you go. A caller. Hello. Yeah, you're doing great. I have been called you the other morning. You were with this fanatic of the closet. Oh, yeah. And if you'd only partially argue with still married, yeah. If a kid's an eye would surprise you, that's standing in the kitchen. Ah, that's you. Where are you? Yeah, Kim is a shock to you, especially. Yeah. He's been a fake in it pretty well. Uh-huh. Well, listen, I was wondering, you did to preach his getting all these commercials. Have anything to do with the strike? I'm, that's a writer strike, so it has, yeah. No, there's commercial actors strike. They're all right too. Wow, so he's making, hey, Wallace, trouble, yeah. I don't blame him. Don't about it. I want to get him on that too. Yeah. You can tell the truth, I was pretty good in the bathing. Dude, I want to come over. Do you? Yeah. What's your name? Sally. Sally? We like that name. Yeah. How old are you, Sally? Um, oh, there. But look younger. Oh, like we said, Sally, nice try. I'm very, very not to me. Okay. Have a great weekend, Sally. Oh, bye. Who's that guy there? You don't know who the hell he is? Now, wait a minute, that looks like Alan there. Doesn't it look like Alan's twin brother? A Ricky Jr., not a Ricky Schroeder. Hello. Hello. Hi. I'm trying to call him the Elijah. You're speaking to him right now. I am. I think so. Hello. She'd had the sort of the radio on it. And you got all confused. Well, don't panic. That's okay. So what's up? We'll read it on the phone. What's on your mind? Yeah, we sound like we're far away, right? Yeah. Well, we are. Where are you calling from? And oh. Yeah, we're far away. We're about like 45, 50 minutes away. Uh-huh. I told him I'm calling because I'm off from work. Great. But I thought I wouldn't hear that. And I wanted to know, how old is the bird? Oh, my God. Why do you want to know that? How old is the bird? Yeah. How old is about the 15? No, no, no, no. How old is it? Now, why do you want to know that? Because I had a bet with someone that you were. I thought you were like, I'll read out 29. Uh-huh. A 30. Yeah. And then someone else said, no, no, you guys 45. Oh, come on. I'm 45. Well, that we know, but I need that we do know. We didn't know how old he was. Now, how old do I sound on the air, but... For me, you sound like you're about 29. Yeah, that's right. So, it's a person. He's about to say, he's about to say, he didn't. He was like 45. No, he's not. People are always shocked when they've even person. He's a lot older than he sounds. I am older than I sound. I will just say this. I am over 30. Now, wait a minute. Who is that? Hold on a second. Who's on this end? James James James James James James. I bet you could make me laugh. Yeah. I'm over 30, man. What do you think about that? I'm under 40. Under 40. I'm under 40. So I'm in my 30s. I guess we both left. Okay. So we'll just let it go. It's somewhere between 30 and 100. That's right. All right. Why do I think you guys are great? Thank you. All right. Have a nice day. Have a happy whatever you're celebrating. Okay. I'm all right. Well, that James, man. I'll tell you, see you coming to the party, Harlan? What? What do you mean you have trust me? In other words, I get to pick everybody who shows up. How about L.E. or whatever the hell is his name? He better be here. Oh, is this where Alan gets up in the audience? Wait a minute. I want the bird to watch very carefully now. Okay. Because in just a moment or doing that, there's Harlan continuing to do a Cornyan on everything he can get his hands on. That is. Yeah. He's definitely going to be at the party. Okay. If you're ringing right now, just let it keep ringing. Okay. Because we've got very important stuff we're concentrating on. And any second now, Alan is going to get, is this coming right here? Any moment now. You're going to be so excited to go inside it is the word. I really are. You're going to become just apoplectic when he comes, um, flying up, bobbing up out of the audience. Let's see if he does his usual thing. Now look at that Jim boy. See a ball of fire or what? Huh? He probably can be like the entertainment director at the house next week. Harlan is this really, now let me ask you something. Where did Bob just go? Oh, she had to leave. Michelle had to leave, but Bob is coming back, right? Isn't that kind of interesting? Huh? That was very strange. And here comes Alan in just a second out of the audience. I know you're waiting with Baytherbreath. Mr. Hill, I know you had to push him back up there. He is there. He is right there. You couldn't miss him in a million years. Shake it his booty. There's like KC. And somebody pushed him away. Harlan told him right back. Get the hell out of here. Harlan pushed him away. Don't you think Harlan deserves some extra. Harlan, uh, we have to shake hands. I get it. We have to do the news now. Yesterday, you were muscling in and Bob now you're moving on to Harlan. What's it going to be next? Neil Rogers, the rocket roll monster. Okay, it's eight to five. Seven on Zeta Four. And here, can you believe it? We only got a little over an hour to go. Really? Yeah. Is that right? Holy. We've already done three hours. Seems like only like two days ago. We sat down here on the set. Maybe we could play a few and over a friend. And the possibilities is coming by with lunch. Which is going to be one of the highlights. We're really sorry that Michelle had to go to work. But I guess it's a matter of time. No, no, she had to go get her nails. That's who I want to know. Who's Kenny Rogers? Is he really? That's what you're going to be here next week. Michelle didn't have to go to work. What does he go like that? Like, what does he do? What does that mean? He wouldn't show up. And he's busy, right? I didn't understand that he's busy. Michelle had to go get her nails done. Oh, she had the nails. It's a priorities. Now you understand. For what? For like two Easter? Yeah. Good. You have to nod on your bathing suit. She's just going swimming. I mean, nobody's going to molest you because we're busy in here. It'd be later. Okay. Anyway, I guess we should take some more calls. And the only way to do that is if we like plug it back in, right, huh? You're in charge of the jack. Hello. Yeah. But. Yes, sir. Hello? Yeah. Yeah. Going has big to us. Okay. I want to know about the piece. The P.B.K.S. movie. What up today? Yeah. I'm going to be able to see it today, sir, because I'm tied up. And I don't think my heart will take it anyway. Why that you have gotten to the note is on. Uh, not on this one. I'll probably see it Monday. Oh. Yeah. You're going to go see it today? I was hoping. Yeah. You were to chop up over here. Well, she did that while back. But Debbie's seen the ads on TV for the fair. Yeah. She's all through all through the ads. And in the music video by Brian Ferry, which is the theme song to the movie. Who? You heard me. Uh, Michael J. Fox Kisseser. And then takes her to bed. Jump for you. Yeah. Yes, he does. And that's pretty ridiculous. Shocking. Shocking. Nothing will ever happen there. What about Michelle? She's going to the B.B.C.I. Red yesterday. And in B.C. Oh, I don't know if the B.B.C. Well, we're close. We have a side of the wall. Yeah. No. She's going to New York. She's going to be winking her. And maybe we'll see her on the network. We'll have to think her. I'm Neil. It's just like, gone off this video. Take. I'm curious. Who's who that is? Oh, it's Ali again. And he's definitely going to be a. I'm sure it's. I mean, get the head out of town. Yeah. And takes her wink with her. Okay. Okay. I'll let you know what I'm trying to see. See you this week. And I'll let you know what's up on it. Appreciate it. Thanks a lot. I'm sure that before Monday. No doubt. Okay. She'll ask. A 59 wc t a min b for a lot of data from the publishers. Tara and Bob together. They're really. And I have a feeling, somebody we know it was probably not too happy at the end of this particular scene here when the Bob just grabs. Tara by her bodily parts. Wait. I'm telling you. Wait until you see what goes on to be in this. Little scenario there. Not just arm and arm, but there's isn't it right here that it goes on down on the floor.
