At 505, the temperature in South Florida's 82 degrees. I'm Bill McQuake. For news, frequent weather and exclusive jetcoufter traffic. It's 610 WIOD, depend on it. And now, live to WIOD's new talk studio for a major news conference. Here's Vice President and General Manager of WIOD and WGTR, Mike Disney. I am extremely excited and proud to announce the signing of a major personality in South Florida to news talk radio 610 WIOD. Neil Rogers has agreed to join the greatest lineup in talk radio in the country, starting next Monday morning. Neil will follow 13 year morning veteran Mike Rinerie at 10 a.m. each weekday morning. He will be the lead-in to the market's top afternoon drive talk host Steve Kane. We believe this to be the strongest talk lineup, not only in South Florida, but in the entire country. The signing of Neil Rogers gives WIOD the markets number one morning, midday and afternoon drive talk host. And with the Miami dolphins and the Miami hurricanes play by play, it certainly makes WIOD the leading amstation in South Florida. Neil, congratulations. Welcome aboard and now let's Steve Kane, Mike Rinerie, Glenn Hill and you take over on 610 WIOD. That was impressive, wasn't it? Wasn't that fabulous? That's here for Mike. Now, what's your thing? You're going to be on Mike. I think this man has a big future in broadcast. You really done. Mike sits down here. He sits down. So you're shift to safe, like, congratulations. I think there's been an oversight when they said we're signing a single major personality. I think Dr. Glenn Hill's joining the stage. Dr. Will I make Dr. Hill? Dr. Will. You look like a doctor with those glasses. You've always said very kind things about me over the years. Steve, I certainly have noticed. I met every single one of the people. I mean everything that I say over the radio. Wow. Morales. Hmm. It's good to have you before. Well, thank you, Steve. And that exciting seems like only just moments ago we were on the year and is depressing. The morbid studio and just couldn't wait. The last half hour was like the last 20 years of my career. It just went on and on and on. And I said, what kind of a douchebag places is this? See, we got that in there right away. Right to get to the back of your money. They do. They do. They do. They do. Okay. How do you like that for changing his image? I would never say douchebag. Okay. We only been here two minutes and already rubbing off on renewing. We're new. That's a new era, man. That's a new era. What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? What do you think? The kind of crowd that's going to come hang it out in your restaurant. Oh, wait. The only thing I can see is is I have heard from time to time that maybe you've said some unkind things, not talk about more. Not true. I'm like, and you said, and I'm proud of you. You know that he stood outside. Seriously. He stood outside at Studio Window for 20 minutes getting that thing. That's the thing you're right. I'm proud of that. And that I heard myself. Okay, my picture knows. Okay. Well, it's now my turn. Okay. I'm excited. Go ahead. I just say this. Well, I just moment. I want to throw it away. Can I say this? Yeah. Because you know why I'm showing you think this? I am the member of the garage shot. I am Mr. Ego. Oh, Mr. Ego. Yeah. No, what do you know that? Do you know now when I introduce myself at the night at the Miami Arena, the wrestling matches I introduce myself as Mr. Ego Steve Canne. And they blew like crazy. They certainly, but that's only because I say from WIOD, the Miami Dolphins. And they really blew like crazy. I kind of cover myself. But what I was going to say is as you know, Neil, I am the therapeutic one. I think it's important that we're not going to have a therapy now. No, once you said that from Monday. Do you remember the last thing we did therapy? I ended up with no clothes on in the studio. Oh, I remember the idea. Anyway, frightening moment. We won't really, we won't really really bring back the whole thing. I think it's important that we take this opportunity, given the opportunity, Steve gets like a douchebag, doesn't he? You really get the order to get it. Can I just say this? I think it's important that we get it all out on the table and this out on all these hostilities. Like for example, the hostility mic that you just expressed towards Neil. Now I am going to get it out there. And we can invite Patty Murray to come in too from the outcome. I'm not sure if you should say that I suggested that. Let her get it out of her sister. I did suggest that I won't tell you what she said. It never gets out of her sister, man. She wore two sizes smaller. I got to take this in isolated. Let me tell you something. I got to tell you something. This is a Christmas party. We can charge admission for it. I can promise you. Anyway, is there anything you mic? When you put out that, it's against the rules. When you get the cigarette police in here, please for this man. I'm allergic. This is a really hostile act. Mike, do you know that? Why are you hostile? I'm not being hostile. You're being hostile, trust me. I'm being paranoid, trust me. I'm being hostile. I'm being hostile. I'm being hostile. I'm being hostile. You need this. Are you uncomfortable here? Yes. Okay, we'll end smoke. I was an honest answer. That was an honest answer. He's uncomfortable. He would rather smoke than be in your presence. That's what he said. Quite frankly, Mike. And if I have to do both, I'll split the difference in smoke. I mean, I'll put that cigarette out. Get out of here. Now, so there's nothing you want to get off your gland. Did you say something about therapy a moment ago? If you're into, you believe in that touch. Now, this is something to do with Michael Disisto. And I'm telling you that you don't want you to know. Michael speaks very well if you knew. Doesn't he really do that? Very well. He's a big fan of it. That means we get to meet Michael Disisto, right? I have a chance to explain to him. He's going to make a change. We brought for you. Monday is going to be here in person in the studio. Dr. Vaughn. And then he was from Monday. And that'll be you end of this joint. I'm telling you. But Michael, actually would like to be a guest on the Neil Roger show. What do you really think? I just got to do. Good luck to him. Monday, Monday, what can we look for? Monday. But we haven't even told anybody anything. Now did Mr. Hanch out over here? Did he tell anybody? What time I'm going to be honored? Yeah. Yes he did. You did say that. He said you were going to be the lead. I'll line him to. I remember you're the lead. You're going to be an lead. So the number one helps you to do a talk. I think that back. It's, uh, nobody's perfect. Anyway, 10 to two, right? You don't have to show it to me. Don't start getting defensive already. I work for plenty of defensive management in this market. Trust me. What is it all is that this is going to be. Can I say Dennis Collins on here? Can I just say that? What is it you would like to say about Mr. Jones? I just want to say the name. You just want to say the name. You're coming from an environment. Do we can say anything, okay? Get it all out of your system. Dennis Collins. Does it have a good? Yeah, it was. Dennis Collins. I think else you're going to have a new Rantel. Alice Rantel. Oh, you can't don't be mean to them. And we don't want to pick on the Sandy because he worked with Sandy for a long time. And they had this. Nice. Nice to see you guys run together. Yeah, right. I know. Boy, those were the days. And I have a feeling that every now and then he thinks about Jack from the beach. Hello, lovely lady. No, I'm sure. Once a great while in this beepously Jack from the beach's voice comes back. He just recesses of his whatever. I think he's struck a nerve. Yeah, I think we struck a wrong up with that. Correct. How can you tell? Because he's smoking. She was a sense. I'm sorry. Absolutely. And just he really does puff on those cancer. I mean, I'm going to tell you my whole nose. I'm going to be morning. Or you're doing more than that. Is this really irritating you? I wouldn't. I swear I wouldn't. I swear I wouldn't joke you. I wouldn't joke you. It really is horrible for me. I disagree. You love it, don't you? Yes, I do. I'm happy. I don't know. This is going to be interesting. This is. You want to go. I want to sound like a butt liquor and ingratiating all of today for a couple of minutes. We will be. But then Monday will tell a truth. But the bottom line is this is the most incredible building. This is a real reason we came over here is because Mitch Ween is the chief engineer, the best engineer in America, Barnau. Okay, trust me when I tell you. And I have worked with some of the most in inept and in competent engineers recently as a matter of fact. Yes. And I just want to tell you that it's paradise. And that's where you came out of. Yeah. I thought it was for the money. Well, I was a part of it. I was going to work with me. The opportunity. That was a very big part of it because what the audience doesn't know is that Steven I have for the past six months have secretly been lovers. We might as well have put it on the table. Right. So that's time. Right. We are going to tell stories Monday. If you want to know what we're going to do Monday, we're going to tell stories that have been too hot for us to tell on Zeta 4. But we can tell them, well, yeah, too hot. We're about the two theory and stuff like that. I mean anything was too hot for us to do. Yeah. Now we're going to tell stories that we're just too sensitive to tell that they would freak out and have heart attacks. So we can tell them on this air and we are going to tell stories Monday. Steve, they will curl your hair. Absolutely. Can't wait. I've got to tell you one thing guys. Now that you work here at W.I.D. Mike Disney, a very fine boss and Bill Wise. Total freedom. I mean anything and everything Bill Wise called me in the opposite. He said, Steve, he's crazy as you want to get. You can name the names. Say whatever you want to say. Total freedom. I don't know. Steve has got the George Carlin album. He's going to cut up any other room. The seven week A.I. case. Yeah, he's got a cute friend. But we are. We're going to tell stories. It is going to be a good one. For those of you who are about what? A bell. He's going to be in a war day. Is it Zeta 4? Things that went on behind the scene. No one knows. Something your town renearies it. He doesn't. He doesn't even know what Zeta 4 is. Oh, that's right. He's a great girl. Is it Zeta 4? Yeah. I don't know. If he had a gun to us. Obviously, not a good one. That's not in the morning and morning though. On the morning. Of course. You're on a tour. We're listening to our station while you were on the air. Do you know we now have this is an interesting thing. I just struck. We now for the first time have a radio station that can really do a genuine battle of the talk shows. We got the. Oh, Tomania. Well, I don't know. I thought that was a really like Alice rentals. I do. When were you stopping? So, how was it? Good friend of mine. I like really. In fact, I don't stop that. In fact, I'm thinking of dropping the lawsuit. None of this great occasion. Are you really? I would be very benevolent of you. Yes. Yes. Why did you roll your eyes like that? I like how. Alice and Mike. I don't dislike Alice at all. Why do you keep you? Do you know just that there's a certain something there like did the man ever have an original idea in his mind? Is that a good kind of a different person? He could be a real nice person too, okay? Oh. Do you want to go to the phone call? All right. All is on his back now. Absolutely. We will go to the phones on this. The last hour of the Mike Disney show will go to Miami, you're on WI as a butt-looking. Hello, are you there? Yes, is this me? No, it's me. Okay. Well, this is your favorite call. This is a hate call. I hate Neil Rogers. Great, sir. Thank you so much. You've made my day already. No, I really think that Neil should not be on the radio in Miami. All he is is a hate monger. Right. Paul, he does a stir up hatred among different people. Right. And I'm going to call all his sponsors and try and get him off the air again. Great. Good. What is that? Great. Who is this? Great. If he's so good, why can't he keep a job? Why can't he keep a job? That's an interesting story. All right. Anyway, we thank you. Thank you for sharing. Let's do it. Thank you so much. Miami, you're on WIOD. Hello. Hello, Steve. How are you? Good. I grew up here while waiting to get on the air. Well, here you are. You look better, sir. Thank you very much. Listen, you remember when you said hello Miami, oh, we got to go to a break. And then you punched the button. That was me. Oh, I got to go with the four ages ago. That was ages ago. That's right. Well, anyway, you're here now. All right. I mean, how about 15 seconds before the break? I'm not mad at John, it's the guy. OK. Anyway, I couldn't wait. So I missed all the heavy stuff, which is great because I'm not into heavy stuff now anyway. But I have three quick points. OK. It's no honor you had to wait, sir. It takes you forever to make your point. You know, Mike's getting the grass. He's rubbing on. He's using douchebag on. He's doing this. Hey, hey, hey. He's back. He's back. He's back. This guy is getting aggressive. We used to be a mild-mannered talk show host. Go ahead, sir. Mike, you're talking away another five minutes while you pop off. Will you go ahead, sir? You're down to about 30 seconds. Oh, yes. Thanks a lot. What do you want, sir? Mike? Yes. It's in there. No, sir. Oh, OK. I think I see. Yes. What do you think about the Harold, uh, interesting, short push? What's your has a lot to do with this guy? Hello, sir. Will you wait? How long did you wait on the phone? Uh, like 35 minutes. I see. We're going to let you go into our 45. We're going to take a short break. We are back with you. Steve Kane, on Newstalk Radio 610 WIOD. D.D.Po, Neil, have you ever done at the D.Po? No, but I've heard that. That's great. You are. I'm being honest with you. I haven't been there. I heard that it's crap. Yes, you said, hey, man. I said, Neil. I said, Neil. It's a great joint. I said, Neil. Well, you have been here to Neil part. I haven't been smoked. Go to the D.Po. That's smoke of my ears. If you come going to D.Po tonight. Are you really? You're kidding me. Are you really? You're right. I was going to advise to be my guest. You're not going to eat there. You're just going to smoke. I was going to lie to you on your smoke. Yeah, that's his new campaign. I'd like to invite you Neil and Glenn to come on down to the D.Po. One of these nice ones. They have fabulous seafood, some incredible. They have a prime rib that is so incredible. It's especially at the Hashtag. They roasted in a rock-solid cast to preserve all those natural juices. They floated in about a half inch of that. Aju, natural gravy. Unbelievable. Now that you can come down and watch to see. Yeah. Only if they watch to see it. Okay. You're really not how to hurt a guy. If you live in the South End of Tanya, you are really going to enjoy the D.Po incredible gourmet dining. They're located at 5830 South Dixie Highway, which is about 2 blocks south of the Bay Greece Center. When you're in there, you'll be sure you can go to the Bay Bay. Right in the middle of the Bay Bay. Really? Yeah. Fabulous, fabulous. Fabulous. I've seen it many times. And Dixie Highway, right? Yeah. What were we talking about? What were we talking about? No, no, before the D.Po. What's the year? Do you want to rip you down when we were talking about? Hey, there were no, wait a minute. Was that the spot? What? That was the spot? That was the spot. Go on. That was the D.Po. The fabulous delicious prior experience, excellence, or as you, as we say and don't start with that next stuff. All right. Now, what was the question? Oh, about Alice. Yeah. Now, what was this? A challenge. An ultimate. What do you mean an ultimate? What the hell does that mean? What you want to know what it means? It means evidently just in case. I think in the occasion is particularly reported. That's exactly what I was just going to say that. He is issued an ultimate that he's not going to let you attack yourself. A steam anymore or something like that. What does that mean attack yourself? It's a steam. How can you attack what a person doesn't have, right? No. Well, what the hell does that mean? Alice. It means he is desperate and he wants us to talk about him. You know something? I think we should do it. I think we should do it. Excuse me? No, I think we ought to talk about Alice. You're right. I think it's the least we can do. Because, quite frankly, he's the only vestige of anything, which is in much that's hanging on over there by a thread. And basically, when it's start playing Chinese melodies on Monday, I don't know if you'll fit the form. I'm not doing it for two seconds. You're Jerry Wichner. Do your Jerry Wichner. Oh, no, I'm not doing Jerry Wichner. Oh, come on. Mike is here. You get upset. I don't want to let Craig want it now, but that's later on. Anyway, so you know, everybody wants to know. I bet you want everybody in this business. Seriously. Yes. You already only up front. Could everybody in this business and maybe a lot of them have diaries. You know, our listening right now. Yeah. Everybody in this market. There is no question about that. I guarantee that even while he's on the air, your buddy Lee is less is monitoring the show as we speak. I spoke to Lee this morning. And he is, you know, that you're just, directly happy about this. It's for us and he is absolutely. Lee, faller. And we count on some of those famous calls. We can, well, he can't because she's on the end to spows. That's fine. But that's, uh, tender tool. He's in. Oh, you mean from you? Oh, yeah. Who you called you? Absolutely. Great. I am sure that everybody, this something we got, we have to get straight because everybody is, you would kneel working together. You two guys hate each other. I think it's, I think it's appropriate at this moment that you tell the audience exactly how you feel about me. And always know. I love Steve passionately. And I always have had the secret thing. Oh, since he shaved his beard, I must say he's not as cute as he used to be. No, you know what, do you know what I shape my beard? It has to do with you as a matter of fact. That's really, you know what? You got on the, remember we ran into each other that night up at that Chinese restaurant. And I heard a terrible thing that you said about me at the Chinese restaurant about. I was in a slime ball and, no, how dare I go up here and eat their ones on superdose. Don't you think he's there? Don't you believe that wasn't true at all. We should kneel and I ran into it. This was a sponsor that I had that was a place by the way. In fact, it's absolutely KT and I were up there at the depot and you were up there trying to steal the sponsor with standards. I remember. And you got on the air the next day and you said, a cane looks so old like you daged your head. You know, because my beard had granted. No, you didn't look good. And I got up the next morning. I looked at the mirror and I said, my god, kneel is right. And he took my raise. I took my raise always right. I took, well, let's not talk to you. I took my raise and I was a choice between cutting my wrist or shaving my beard. And I decided to shave my beard. And I've been clean shaving. I've been ever done. So another summary. I'm responsible for that. And I do look 10 years younger. Did you have a beard? Where were we? I had a beard when I got here. I never noticed. I was. Now he's a blivety. Now, he managed to have it. He is out of it. We're talking about him in the battle of the talk show. We had a letter. I mean, a little bit of a talk show host. We had a letter. I mean, a little bit of a talk show host. We had a letter. We all take off my clothes. Is there any such thing going to be on that? What? Absolutely. We must live my eye to learn. We have to set a time limit on the concentration camp. Seriously. I mean, after the first six hours, it's going to be me turning. You're a younger and you're an easy guy. You only hurt people you love. The only did a couple of too many issues on socks. But other than that, he was all right. What were you going to say? Well, that passing gas show. We had a letter many, many months ago. I see the famous, famous letter over at Zeta and the, at the, at the PS on the letter said PS, Neil is right all about everything. I think my mother wrote that one. Now, she did not. And we remember that stuck with his for some reason. We have found out over the years, the years I've worked with Neil, that basically he is right. Whenever he was in the town, this is proven. This is proven. I think by your beard story. Yeah. Well, he was right on the night. He was good. I'm telling you. What are you looking for? You didn't have a beard. No kidding. Do sheveled and gray and like aging. And now you look, look, a munch. Look at this, man. It's a nice man. You know, some of you lost weight. You look fabulous. Like in the red man. You never heard so much but looking. He was a little bit mean to ward of it. You know, but it's just a radio show. He lost weight. If we can stick. Yeah. Oh, you're too. This is the adabair. And he lost weight. I've missed the hell of a lot here. This is amazing. We have that anorexic look like you've got. Okay, Mike. So just put it down. Wow. But anyway, the people and the radio wars. People never understood about the radio wars that it was. It's fun. You love it. Don't you? I love it. No, wait a minute. That was when your buddy like is was here. Okay. Well, he got the real and he was a little carried away. Yeah. He was a little carried away. Yeah. I don't like him. And he's doing the radio. I don't like him. I haven't got any idea. I did see him on with Ward Downey. And he was there with the alonismatter of fat. And with who else? Who was under? Jerry Williams. Here we have another show. Jerry was on with me. When you set him up with that information, Dishabitage me and he never pulled the trigger. Oh, I saw that show about that. I saw that show. No, I don't. No, you don't know about that. No. I saw him in the show. He was talking about Duke Cockass. And he had all that meal in the seriously about his recall campaign. I never saw him. Oh, no. I'm talking about when he we were on. I was on. Who was it? Which one was it? Haraldos on Haraldos. You were on Haraldos. Haraldos. And the guy's the one who wanted my heroes. Haraldos. He's a heavyweight in there. You have a new map. No, no. You will be. This is when we play group therapy. Mike, I can't wait to get you in a good game of group therapy. And what was the TV show where Don Webb was the caston over? Oh, that was an old-fashioned show. Yeah. I missed that. Yeah, well, lucky you. Yeah. Forging them. You're lucky guy. Don, we used to, they old. This is going to be like the old days. That's what he had. No, no. That's great in the old days. I'm impressed whoever does hope for his research. They seek doubt in the South. I thought I was going to find one caston over. Don Webb. Don Webb. Well, Don has a way with the ladies. They tell me. Secondly, to one of your favorite people. Who's that? You know, the biggest caston over in Miami is Rick's side. And that is a fact. A fact. To we have to get started on him now. You're not going to attack my good friend Rick. I wouldn't do that. Rick is a nice man. And he speaks very well with you. I've heard. You're going to fight with him. Here I took. Did you hear I took Rick and. So it's out to dinner and they made he friends. They made for to the depot. Yeah. I didn't think that pretty tight right now. They are so to speak. Good friend. It shows your tight. I can make peace without you. Exactly. That is the fact. But don't count on the three of us going to dinner. Okay. He's one Monday. I listen to the way to the movie. We can actually say no. You taking a cider minute. Oh, we're going to be in the middle. Oh, those three of us. I don't think that'll be happening soon. I think it was about as much chance that happening is Duke Caucus winning a massive victory next to it. I think it would be great. Are you looking forward to the Christmas party? I really am. The Christmas party. The Christmas party. And we've got some real surprises for them. It'll be great. Hermit and McBean. My good friends. Harry. Harry. Harry. Rick. And you're own personal, huh? Yeah. As a matter of fact, we understand that the... When word got out that you were coming over here and we know it. What do you mean word got out? Well, the word got out. What do we have rumors? Rumors have been running rampant that the sports department. Mr. Weaver, Mr. Goaver, Mr. Goaver, Mr. Goaver. They put together a member. They said anything you can do to get Neil. And he... pay him anything, bring it. Yeah. Because they love you. Because they know you're a sports oriented person. Yeah. I think the dolphins are weak in the hurricanes are... You know something else. You don't like the hurricanes. Not at all. Now, I'm that. In fact, there was an article in the St. P. Times that led her to the editor about the hurricanes from a Notre Dame fan. Uh-huh. And they went on and on about the stuff that happened before the game and the fist fight. So we had a whole song in a dance. And it was just like every... Every season we have the same kind of thing which you'd be Johnson. Okay, I don't want to attack him this first day. I'm not even on the air. I'm just a guest. Right. Okay. But that wig for crying out loud. You're ready for it. But you get a long way with Rick. I mean, he looks like how he duty in drag for crying out loud. What's that? You're going with Rick. He's one of the great play by play. I've always said that. One of the great play by play in ounces in the country is getting a little surly. But I don't blame him. If you just had that team to work with, you'd be surly too. Hank is a good friend of mine. He's a fellow degenerate. He loves the track man. He can't be nuts. You know, he's fat. He loves the track. What more does anybody need? Yeah. And he keeps running out there to California. Allegedly to go to Prettykin. And only wants to do his go to Santa need a home. I've never conned you on that. Okay. Joe's a geek. You know, whatever your personal responsibility. In many comers. He's a nice guy. He really is super guy. I'll be talking to anyone. Oh, good. I'll just be wild. A Monday we're coming out. We're pulling out all the stops. Yeah. And trust me, we've got to say nice things. We're going to say do you spend several times in the past. Thanks, Colin. You can't better find a new word because Reneri has already stolen. You like that. Did you see how that appealed? He just gone nuts with that. I could be a child with a kid. I'm going to point free cigarettes in a row. Do you? Do you? He just may have never said doch bag on a radio. Until it never failed. Doch bag on a radio. Look. Because doch bag is a thing you don't say on a radio. But don't you enjoy the freedom. Now that you said it. You don't just feel like you've been emancipated. And liberating in the old 18th century. Not really. Whatever you say. And Bill Colby says. Man is good. It's so quiet. You're not the cigarette you're lighting up. I'm really suffering. You love that. Well Mike is quiet. Anyway, what I was going to say and I've started several times. But Mike keeps interrupting with Delegrag. Is that now? What does this mean Greg Budell question Mark? Who put that line? One code. One put that there. What does that mean? I guess he wants to know what he thinks. I think that's appropriate. Don't you Greg Budell question Mark? I guess he. Bro. One time is it that pretty well. There are people in this market who are celebrating tonight. Oh, absolutely. All these morning guys. They're going to get these gigantic numbers down. And what? Greg Sonny? Yeah. My good friend Sonny and Mike said. Greg, I'm friendly with all the people. I like Sonny. I don't have any problems. Sonny. Let's do a little bit of a dentist about 10 months ago. Okay. And I ran into Sonny who was there at the same dentist and he was having two grandma boon bottle caps removed from his dentures. And I'm not seriously. He admitted to me that he tapes my show every day. And he listened to what he got off the air. He got off the air. He had a group of you. Okay. And you're taping the competitor's show. So you're going to listen to what I mean. That's an incredible group. That's a douche bag. Okay. Like I said, that's a great big thing. Greg, be careful not to have any ratings before Neil went on in the morning. Yeah. We just talked to him a long little bit. And we just heard him a little bit. He may have a little bit. He's last book just like DuCoccus and the polls. You know, they peeking and all of a sudden. I'm not peeking at the right time. Exactly.

Now to that. Let me ask you. Okay. Because obviously you're the genius. Seriously. Go ahead. What do you think? Alice, you would give him a break. Then he won't have it. See, that takes away his crime. Maybe thing. Then he got up to the cry about. We just call him out. I would say that if we don't call him Mr. Mr. Rental. Mr. Rental has very much a goal. This guy you keep talking about, right? I don't know. You don't know anybody in this work. Now I have no idea. Just kind of do your show. Go back go to sleep and that's it. Wait, come out in. By the way, if you think that he is a better rip off of me. If you can hear a lacitor and Tampa man, you would be sure you're here out. He was one of the major gold bands. Jerks of the world. That is just incredible. Nice voice, but no mom. The earth boy. The other night. Totally different things were both in central Florida this past weekend. And both of us heard lacitor. You know. And they got to. He's on the BLA press in Tampa. Now this is a news talk station with NBC news at the top of the hour. They have this incredible idea that comes on and goes, WFLA, Tampa is not even a spurge. Lock it in. Rip off the day. Good job. Good job. You know, he sounds like weird. And then NBC news sound comes on and so. Yeah. So we're a some truly incompetent talk to host and be. Yeah. We'll talk about anybody we know. Oh, oh, everybody we know. We're going to take a break. We want to send you an guest to Hawaii for the approval of Bob Coochonberg and Larry Zaka for details on winning. Listen to Mike Reneri Mornings.

I can't control your stuff. I don't want to be in spot to do this. I got this stuff and I read you many opportunities. I've got this little gift here. So I can limit my spots to 60 seconds. I know we'll absolutely throw my thoughts to that. Alarm's by HRD. Now, you always heard you ask on the air once. Why do I always start by giving them it? You always announces the name of the espada of the beginning. I always don't have like a billboard. Which I guess is good. What do I think Mike has flipped a circuit here? What is going on, Mike? I'm just saying alarm. Is that what that was? Sounded more like wood's the old. Sorry. Yeah, I got a tell you that that wouldn't really do very much. If I was a burglar breaking in, I wouldn't scare me a bit. Anyway, sounds sense of a little talk much for a living. Did you know that 95% of the people that Colo alarms by HRD... You all did it's called cancelled? Okay, forget this spot. It's called cancelled. It wouldn't surprise me after this. Can you clear your please behave yourself? I'm going to hit this button again. Stop. Get it all right. It's the second. And I want to say that. You did it for the depot. It was like 15 seconds. 13. I tell you. It's a great place. And the food is outrageous. And you're always good in 15 seconds. They got an alarm by this guy that he's talking about right now too. I know what it is. Can we do like the other 40 seconds and give them their money? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. You got to do this. We're backing up on time here and the sun is getting pretty upset. Okay. As I started to say, before you did the deal, you realized by the way that when I came to this time, we'll get the same before they end the show. No, yes, the least. In 1976, March 1st. I'll never forget that horrible day. I came to the cat, KT. And Sunny was the sports director at KT. Now here we are, 12 and a half years later. And I walk in here at WIOD and these police studios and there's Sunny standing in a hallway looking the same, the standing around doing nothing just like he did to the KT. It was in crime. It hasn't changed a bit. He's a good guy, really. It's gone. Now he speaks very well of you. I know that. All right. Alarm's by HRD. People you can trust. Hmm. Now this is getting pondered. Yeah, it's getting pretty sticky. Come on. How do you know what he was? Well, you just bit. I'm not doing anything, man. I'm not smoking. I'm not doing anything. Why risk losing the possessions of a lifetime. Every single thing of value you own. Your baseball cards, your collectibles, jewelry, cash, silver appliances. I don't have any baseball cards. I don't have any jewelry. I don't have any collectibles. Maybe even the life of your family. Why do we do in the baseball card? You're right. What? Do we have to look at baseball? I'll let you do that show again. But only if I'm here. Okay. Will you do baseball cards? You're putting me on. You made fun of them on the air. You're because it's a dreadful topic. But you're into it. Yeah, and so are seven other people in the audience. Okay, and four kids who are under the age of three. All right, you're wrong. Let's finish this fun. The long time. He's so beautiful. This is one of the god deal arms. People you control. Now we had the first thing we did. We moved into our home. We had the great feel safe. A long system put into that house. And if anybody so much tries to stick a their nose in our premises. And a long goes on a siren that will awaken the dead. Now like, but there knows where. Now Mike. Yeah, he said awaken the dead. That should be your cue. Good. Excellent. And not only that, but little like goes on at your closest police station. Cops will be there in a matter of moments to arrest the perpetrator. That's enough Mike. Okay. Call alarms Bay HRD for an O charge consultation in day 252 1014. Let's do five to 1014 and in Broward 525 01045 255 010405 010404 Long HRD.
