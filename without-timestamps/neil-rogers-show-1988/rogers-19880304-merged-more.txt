No, he's a bleep, Ethel Blummers. Who is that? That's the total traveler from K-T. When I first went to K-T, she was on the weekend, the travel Yentre, yeah. Yeah, she's been trying to get on over there. When I was working over there, it was incredible. Yeah. She was trying to get on over there. He was also going to plant you on the weekend now. Up your plants or something like that. So congratulations, Mark. You'll let's hear it for Mark. We're trying to get on to the Yentre and to a parking lot in less than five months. So, that way, we got the total traveler, the total traveler, the total traveler, Ethel Blummers. And then we have the up and the red man and Rusty nail. Routhing it all out. Rusty. When we're going to start doing you and your swimming pool. Rusty, my pipes are a little bit messed up Rusty. Rusty. Do you think there's some correlation between him giving us food? And then a few days later disappearing? Midnight melodies. Did we play something called Midnight melodies? No. I've a note from Norman Kent, the attorney up in Broward. Oh, and just an out. Yeah, I know Norman too. Just to know to share with you how much I enjoyed my Monday morning drive to court. Listening to something you call Midnight melodies. Just keep up the bastardly deeds. Midnight melodies. I wonder how many people want me to put together that thing. You know, I was thinking about that. My favorites are from the early 50s through the 80s and we do a whole show on that. You realize how much money it would cost me to go out and buy all that music? Because I'm thinking our library. I just don't think that we probably have like green door by Jim Lo. Oh, sure we do. And here it is. On Zeta 4. Now we have some surprises in store today. Hey. Because Dennis folds your roses not going to be in today. Okay, roses are going to be way for the weekend. And the rumor is as I was told last night that rose and Gary Lawrence, our executive vice president in general manager and all around. Fascist sympathizer that they may be actually traveling somewhere this morning in the vehicle. Okay, now probably not this early, but maybe a little bit later. In larts vehicle, you mean in somebody's I don't know. Does it make a difference in those vehicle it is? I don't understand what you're saying. The vehicle. Oh, maybe Ed can help you. Somebody turned a damn power off on his machine. If you don't get any Ed, how could it be? How is that possible? Somebody's been in here again. So I don't know if you can put up with that, but I guess if you really want to listen to this day, if you're going to have to. I know. Listen, we started this tape 24 hours ago. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a tape that was said to be a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. I think it's a good idea. Listen, we started this tape 24 hours ago. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a tape that was said to us by the marvelous gentleman up in Fort Laudernale and had all these great bits on it that we were going to maybe play on the air and some we couldn't play. And we've been sampling it for 24 and a second of ours. And Ed is still talking. It's the intro. I can't get intro. He's still doing the talk up. He's at ACNB. In the history of broadcasting, even Rick Shaw has never done a 24 hour talk up ladies and gentlemen. We have that gotten to the first bit. It is incredible. Now, the start of 10 to 6 yesterday. I can't believe it. Can you believe your very ears? I'd tell you. If you missed the first part of the show, you really, Oh, yeah. In fact, several people told me I was really surprised. They heard that routine and it was hysterical. If not intended to be funny and the least bit. But my favorite, you know, my favorite hour of the show is the first hour always because, you know, some mornings you and I are like asleep. I mean, it's just speak for yourself. Would you please? One morning, my favorite friend. One morning, you and I were asleep. Let me change that. One morning, you and I were out of it. What's amazing? I'm out of it every morning. Yeah, I would say that. I wish, by the way, I wish this, this wacko over on the beach would stop sending me these stupid cards and letters with a printing about, um, Jesus, superstar, virgin, mario, mega, moon, new age. You know, all I do is go right in a waist pass. Can I have no idea why he's wasting all that money? Do you know what, and look at here's another one. Tom Heidi Heidi or Heinier or something like that. What, what, what are you looking for? And I hope that guy shows up to cut my hair today, right? Not like that guy yesterday. Oh, did you? And then great. And big day needs his haircut, too. He is here only because we have that other car coming later on and we're going to have two cars to drive out of here. And it was not an easy accomplishment. I can assure that. Oh, it was a, you know, you have another car coming here. And just just one for a week at Tiffany. And she knows you know, but you do need another car. It's true. Oh, absolutely. I'm glad you got it. Well, there's seven days in a week and that'll make it right for it. That's right. So if there's anybody out there's got like a 928S or something like that that they want to let me, you know, drive around for a year or so we'd be delighted. You have another car. That would make five. Yeah. Another car coming. Okay. All right. Well, you know, I'm crazy. I'm weird. Just one car. Well, you know, you did have two for a while there. Let's not get back into there. Oh, let's not unless you. In fact, well, if he ever comes back in here, I think you'll have an apology and meet already talked to him. Yeah, that was not you spoke to him about it. Already. Yeah. And he didn't know what I was talking about. He's, uh, sound asleep. It's a three minutes till six on Zeta for now. Let's get those numbers out. It's a Friday morning. And I would suggest you if you're listening to the show in a car right now. Any kind of a vehicle. Uh, we're doing our own little survey here. In fact, we hired away the program director from Wyman hundred that 10 year old kid. And he's out there counting headlights. So turn on those headlights, flash and real nice now. And that'll indicate to everybody around you that you're listening to Zeta for, okay? That's spot that they are running is the most insipid stupid thing. Have you stopped and really thought about what it says? Oh, yeah. Now, they won't play the same record twice in an hour. No, I think that's he. No, that's not what he says. He says you won't hear the same song every hour. Now, what does that mean? Can you explain that to me? It means what I just said that they won't play the same song twice. That's what it means. But that's how we are doing this. I know. He says we won't play the same song every hour. That's what it means. Yeah. Now, you are aware that this entire series of spots. You know, there's sequels, right? They asked for your input. Then they come back and, you know, they've taken your input. Now, here's what they're going to do. WZTA Miami Beach Fort Lauderdale in the Palm Beach is it's 5.58. Yes. Well, these were all done at the beginning. That's what my point is. These were all done at the beginning. They were all done at one time. You are aware that. Speaking of what? Nothing. Did you have an idea there? Yeah, that's okay. Ha ha ha. Okay. Be moody and all that kind of stuff. I can't help it. I was going to let you play it. Are you sure? Oh, later. Okay. Oh, that's good. Now, he's turning his own pot down. Did you hear that? That sounded really good. Are you going to talk into that mic that's up on the ceiling there? Now, now we're going to make a pledge, too. Okay. We're not going to play the same song twice in one hour. Okay. You think Rose Folger is already in the car with our fastest sympathizer general manager? We could only buy 59. Okay. Now, let me ask you a question. When it gets to be like six o'clock, like couple of seconds afterward, would that be not playing the same song twice in the same hour? Absolutely correct. You absolutely got it. See, that's what they're going to do kids. And while I'm 100, they're going to play like Michael Jackson, some real wimping Michael Jackson record it about four minutes of the hour. And then they'll come on with some big ID and a whole big song in advance. And then they'll play it again at like a minute after the hour. Also, you can have Captain Dave do his big ID here. Yeah. And that's a good idea. And then you can play it right after. Maybe I should play because it is kind of what you're talking about. Is it good? Well, it's an air check that we got from Y100. I think so. Oh, great. Let's hear that. I can't wait. Get into the top of the hour with funny socks on, say it before. WCTA, Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, and Palm Beach. Radio station where we don't say the same thing every five minutes we get into here. Hey, funny. Yeah. I just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes. What was that? I said, did I just hear you say that we don't say the same thing every five minutes? You've gone brain. You just broke the wrong. Sure. I got it. You've gone. You've gone. Let's go. Wait up here. Funny size. I was able to fall. Oh. Well. It's six o'clock on WZ. Miami Beach. Fort Lauderdale. The fuck bitches. Well, I just thought I'd better say it because I don't know if mumbling the ID makes it. Does that make it legal or not? It's true. Okay. Anyway, here we are. Let me give those numbers out because I know the audience is going to be responding with a frenzy today. Don't you think? Oh, yeah. You think so? No doubt. No question. And if figure out's listening, Big Davis here, okay? I'm not sure if he's going to be listening to that in passing. My mic is on the ceiling, but he is actually here. I'm sure he'll call. And he's not making any maneuvers to try to lower it. So that indicates something to me. And indicate he's asleep. I think he is asleep. Well, tell you, was I, I think I deserve some kind of an award for actually a rousing relief. Out of the sack and getting mingered. Well, he's thrilled to be here about the. But I must tell you that the worst part of the whole deal was I had to listen to him singing to all the songs that we were playing this morning on the way to work, which was a punishment far worse than death. Exactly. Wait, is that mic work now? That's your own mic, by the way. I know, I never, this is, this is pretty interesting. Does it seem like it's fading out or something? Yeah, it's like the phone calls. This does not work either. What's it, does it? This level. Can't hear the door. Well, how about this? This work? Yeah. Well, he said it was blue. I just blew things right now. How about now? Does it work now, Big Davis? Okay. That's good. Like I said, it works great. It looks really, really. Oh, but it took a good probably. Anyway, it's a 602 out there to for now. Listen, Monday, would you, would, Monday? Somebody said to me, Sally, I saw Sally yesterday and you know what she said to me about you? She said lately you've gotten just back to your old self again. You're just cackling up a storm. And while I told you you're getting paid by the cackle, that's when she understood it. Well, I can't say absolutely not. Yeah. And you're just out of control again. I don't know what the hell has happened. Maybe it's all the food that came in this week. Anyway, Monday morning at 830 and this could be the beginning of a series of swimsuit Contests. Cooper City High, allegedly the seniors are having a skip day on Monday. That's the rumor. We can get some verification on that before the show is over. And they're going to be out here in front of the window, Parading around in their bathing suits. Young ladies and men, young men and ladies and some who are kind of like in between. And we're going to judge and we'll come up with something. We'll find some albums or CDs or something. Give away. Yeah, we have some prizes. Do we? Yeah. Yeah, how about some of those old pink Floyd tickets? Those ought to be good. They got some squeeze. Some thing tickets ought to be good too. Yeah. And a little squeeze too. Okay, it's 603 and here are those numbers that you've been waiting for in date County. Now, it's interesting that they're already like four lines lit up, which is pretty good, right? But I do remember back on AM. Do you remember the days when lines used to flash without the numbers just automatically? And we would just punch them up every day. And then somebody came along and started doing a screen list Thursday. Which I thought was an incredibly original idea. In the date County 620 3600 that 620 3600 and it's Broward 779 3600. Now what do we need to wake the audience up this morning? Okay. And you notice he is nowhere to be found again. He's reverted back to his old tricks. He's scrounging for food in the lobby. Now he really is. Tell me more about Sally. What do you want to know? What she said about. She said that you have been cackling up a storm lately, that for a while you were kind of quiet and subdued. And that lately you're just constantly cackling that you never stop with that a positive or a negative thing. Well, I don't know. She just, and that always Sally has put on some weight. Sally, if you're listening how do you got to stop? I mean, seriously, she's put on some, she goes from what extreme to the other. She goes from string bean to, uh, pudgy. And she's even like broken out. Probably eating chocolate by the pound now or something. Sally, you got to stop. Pressrated. Well, yeah, it is something like that. Too many of those movies, how do you all do it to you? It's a four minutes, four minutes after six on Zeta 4. And you want to do the weather, not, they better not. Let me do shells first, okay? And I wish they how he would come back from wherever he went. Do you have any idea where he went? Why do you want to back? Like I said. I'm serious. I just get nervous when he is away for these prolonged periods of time. He's got his food and he's all right. He's got his food. Well, what a great segue into shells, right? If you don't have any hostess Twinkies at dinner time, why not head for shells for delicious shellfish and great pasta. And that shrimp pasta is so good that it's absolutely unbelievable. I mean, it is just delicious. And shells is not a fancy, fancy place with tuxedos and fancy waiters and all that other kind of garbage. It's a very informal laid back place. Take the whole family in there. The kids can cry and make a big scene. And everybody can have a good time. And you're going to absolutely love the food, the prices, and the casual atmosphere. It shells. A full pound of freshly steamed shrimp, for example, is only $7.90. All shells cram board is way in and a pound and a half each and started only $6.95. And to give you a shrimp scampy that's this huge bowl of incredible shrimp for just $7.95. In a ways of full pound. So you stop in any evening, beginning at 5 p.m. at any of the three shells locations for fantastic seafood and fantastic. Value. Value. It's just fantastic. And here are the three locations. They're in sunrise. On university, just north of sunrise Boulevard. They're in North Miami Beach. And now the new location is open in Oakland Park. Half my west of US one. That's an open park Boulevard. Did you get that? Okay. Another weather is partly cloudy. Slight cancer rain. High today into more near 80 and low tonight near 17. Now this is the kind of morning meal like 72 degrees outside. Why is that? Because it's nice and nice and warm. Yeah. I'm going to go outside and do this show. Okay. On the lawn. That would be original. Maybe on Monday we ought to do that when the kids are out here. Oh, oh. Although he promises big day of his threatened to come by here. I invited him to be one of the judges and he's threatened to come by at around 830. Which means he doesn't have to get up at 4 p.m. at a morning be here. And I thought we'd all just kind of sit here inside an oagal and oagal. Because when they can't see us and we can see then there's something voyeuristic. I know they can't see the interview that went up. But Jimmy Swagger would like to be here. I got a couple of bibs. But you know what they say. Judge not less DB judge. Isn't that what they say? That's what the word said. But big day prefers getting up at 430. You better do the weather. Okay. Because we don't have time to mess around today. Okay. You already did it. I was worried. I said it's 72 but you didn't say at 607 on Zeta 4. We do. That's incredible. It's a 6-0-9 on Zeta 4. That really is shocking to be honest with you. It is. You stole it from a who stole it? Who stole it? Who stole something? I stole something from the lawyers office. No, I don't think I stole anything. Okay. Now what what have you got there? Is that something important? Oh, I was just reading this nice ladies letter. And I like the stationery says I'm 40 at the top and at the bottom and damn proud of it. Talking on the year with a mouthful of food also known as pig radio doesn't make it. Just as it doesn't make it off the year. You're cackling sidekick who cackles at everything. Whether it's fun or not. But make it. Being rude to callers who may not be quite as interesting as you'd like doesn't make it. Calling the cacklers reading from the life section of USA today news is an insult to all legitimate news journalist and doesn't make it. Listen to caller after caller tell you how great you are doesn't make it in his boring. Calling your competitors names on the year when they can't respond to you. Don't really doesn't make it but is cowardly. Quite frankly if you were in a market with any sophistication like Boston or New York you're sure wouldn't make it. They'd be fighting it out for last place with the Motivation Station. Steve Cain spelled CAI and his him came in unable has challenged you on a number of occasions to go on head to head with him on the year. I know you think issue oriented programming sucks but why don't you take him up on it. It could make for some great radio and if things got a little tough you could always start cackling. Sign Susan Martin in Fort Laterdale. Shut dumb douchebag. Incredibly done. What a miserable bitch. Why does she listen is my. Yes, I'll be interested to see if listen to this. I'll be interesting to see. So what you know what you're dealing with a road scholar like Susan. That's great. I'll be interesting to see if you have the balls to read this letter over the year. I don't think you will but perhaps some of these other guys with the low ratings might. It will only take a couple of them to reach an audience the size of yours although it won't be filled with little boys from Cooper City High School boy boy. Carbon copy Steve Cain Paul Lyle Joy Reynolds, great beet Ellen Jeff Charles. That's here in person. We got a real spag. He's a dumb bitch. She's probably not a way to deny it. You know, he's listing right. Are you kidding me? She wouldn't miss the show. She gets sexual excitement from this show. That'll word. She's got one of those vibrator radios. Oh my god, it's hot. Incredibly. In fact, if you knew where all of us were right now. I like it. I feel like I'm being sucked into the Grand Canyon ladies and gentlemen. This is good. It's 11 past six. On Zeta 4 or something. Very close to that size. Anyway, we do have one line still open and Broward because it was flashing and kept and they was very busy eating. 7, 7, 9, 3600. Now there will be no food coming in here today. Okay, under any circumstances. Not even no. Unless of course Susan stops by with some goodies for us. Oh yeah, we'll welcome her. Now when he's talking over in the corner, what is his microphone sound like? I'm on acid or something. It gets like it's flashing from left right. Is your microphone. That's what it does in my ears too. Oh, it's all right. I'm hearing anything wrong. See, he noticed it too. It's like sometimes you're in the left channel. Exactly. I'm watching that he was talking about that. You're wrong. Yeah. There's no problem. I'm watching the view meter. Both needles are moving identically. Okay. I think you have a needle problem there. I don't think it's on the board. Well, isn't it funny that he noticed it too? Well, like I said, words of a feather inject together. It's 12 and it's after six on Zeta 4. Let's take our first call in beautiful date county. How are you? Not too bad, just off. Pretty good. Now is this Susan Martin by any chance? Are you kidding me? I'm just not just right. Something is crude and rude as that. Is that incredible? It's like that's so uncool. And talk about childish. She's sending it to all these other people. So they'll read it all later. It's like so ridiculous. And you also say something like that. Why don't you just call up and say it to you or just like go in there and say, Look dude. Yeah. Like, wow. Yeah. Right. Anyway, I just wanted to know. We just will not answer that last line here. You know, there's something about him this morning. It's not a big deal, but he just refused to answer. The hell is not your lights up. You're what your lights out into a winking. Okay. You figured it out. See when you just come in. When you hold on a second. Hold on a second. Zeta. All right. Come on. Okay. Hold on. Oh, I'll see. That's why. Susan. Was that you think that was Susan? I hope so. Okay. That's what it was. You believe that? Oh my God. That's when I'm out. Long time ago. So what's up this morning? Not a month. Did this one ask you question, what do you think is going to happen to this Robert W. Walker after he testifies and all those goodies? I don't know anything about a wire. Are they going through that license thing now over there? Oh, that's not pale at deal. Oh, still? No. Good. Never been rolling stone and everything. And it's like they got one company that wants to get 100 off the air and everything. And they're creating whole big scandal and it's a cocaine or whatever. To a play the record and stuff. Well, I don't know what's going to happen, but I do hope that they stay on the air. Because I like stations that I have 10 year old program directors. Oh, God. Can I sniff a little vix in piece? What are you upset about? I mean, he's injecting in there and he's sniffing airplane. Glu, can I do a little vix? At least it's illegal substance anyway. I'm sorry. I also Robert Walker's a friend of mine. Oh, he's a good one. Yeah. We go way back. Oh, do you. Hope that everything works out for him over there. If it's ever a while. Yeah. Does that remember when I first moved down here about 70 years or so, my dad used on the radio. Oh, sure. He's been here long time. Oh, yeah. Anyway, I just want to know your opinion because it's like a lot of people are saying, Wow, this guy's going to get this guy's going to get that out. Well, it would be easy for us to take cheap shots, but we don't do that. Oh, I know. Yes, sure. Unless Susan is involved. Of course. Okay. Listen, have a great day. See you later. Six 14 on Zeta 4. We have an open line in date County where Susan is trying desperately to get through from Brown or at six, if actually Susan can call us collect on the day line. Okay. Six to 0, 36 hundred because we know that Susan's listening right now. Oh, what was her name? Susan Martin. I wonder if she's related to Bob Martin who used to be on with Craig or Billy Martin or Billy Martin. Probably Billy Martin. Mm-hmm. And she probably hangs out of the bars with Billy. See, now, Davis and my left ear at this very moment. I could not. But he's not saying anything. Exactly. Are you in his left ear? Am I in your left ear? Mm-hmm. Oh, no, wait a minute. That sounded fuzzy in the story. And it's somewhere all with that mic. Is there? Wait a minute. Try it again. Try what? Yeah. Well, it comes and goes. Yeah, it comes and goes. We like to. He's zipping through my brain from his heart. He's zipping through my brain constantly. Just drives me nuts. It's up. Six 15 on Zeta 4. We got a big busy day here. We got haircuts coming up later on at 9 o'clock. And then we got to go get pictures made. Way over the hell. And as they say in China, Yenem's felt, which means another world. For a lot ordeal. For a lot ordeal. Way over by federal highway and for a lot ordeal. And we're not upset about that. So I hope that they don't take up our whole day. No, I am so excited about getting to drive over the new River Bridge again. Second time this week. I am just thrilled. Yeah. And that's the only way to get here. That to get from here to there. Yeah. It's going to take like an hour and a half or something like that. But that's okay. It wouldn't you know that Rose Fulger would disappear on the day that we have to do all of this. Just to coincidence. Rose, we know that. Okay. I guess we're not getting any lines today. So we'll just go to, now I want to go to six because I answered it. Hello. Hello. Hi. Does it smell? Yeah. Is this Susan? Oh, Niel. This is Debbie. Oh, Debbie. How are you doing today? Pretty good. Is this Debbie from Dallas? No. This is Debbie from Fort Waterdale. Oh, yeah. Well, same difference, I guess. Hey, Niel. Listen. Your brunch sounded excellent. Yes. Where is that place? Where is what? That place that taped. Oh, the taped street rotisserie. It's on a quarter-tapped and Douglas in Pembroke Pines and at Strip Shopping Center. Uh-huh. And it's great. And do they have, is it all take out? Yeah. Okay. I want to tell you something. Let me just tell you this. The Amoretto Bocleva, which I have still a lot of it at home. That was the most incredible stuff I've ever had in my life. Sure. Sound is the list. Oh, Nick. Did you? Listen, Niel, my brothers and Brockport. These are the co-existent hello. Great. Well, if he's in Brockport, he can't be all bad. Let's start talking about upstate New York and get the burn really peered. Sure. How we can call. Yeah. Good day, Niel. You too. Okay. 617, I'd say, to four captain Dave by the way. Had another incredible eating day yesterday? Seriously? Uh-huh. I mean, I'm too in a row for captain Dave. And it's just incredible. What's going on in that control room? Uh, let's see. We have an open line now in Broward 7779, 3600. I'm wasn't joking when I said he's not giving me any lines because he's not. Uh, Dave County. Good morning. Morning. He was Charlie from Miramar. Yeah. Charlie. How you be? I know, God, we have this one. I'm going to go on a luxurious three-day fishing trip with BCC. And, um, I know you can't please this hour. But, uh, I would play a play. Charlie, this could be your last call ever if you make a request. Come on. That's seven o' one. Charlie. He's going to do it. I'll wait for the woman. He did it. I can't wait. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I'm not sure. Why don't we put a hole in my thing here. Do you believe that? Oh. And, uh, Charlie? It's just a joke, Neil. No, I don't think so. Charlie's trying to save himself. No, you know. You're about a quarter of an inch away from being banished forever on this show. Do you realize that? Oh, no. Don't you act. And wouldn't that be a dastardly blow at BCC that ever speak to you again over there? Yeah, they would. Because I know we have a big following over there. If I want to tell you that the BCC north in South Campus, you are piped through the Cactiary. Everybody listen to you every morning. Are you cereal? I'm cereal. Hey. Good morning, BCC. As Robin Williams would say, have you had about seven to ten and you'll get a hysterical response? Really? A go apple plastic. What lately, we've been getting hysterical response at about five to six. Listen, since it's after six o'clock, I can't see what I want to say. But tell Diane of that her name? No, Sue. This guy is Sue. That's very listen. No, that was very close, Ed. Yeah, it's Susan. What do you want us to tell Sally? Well, Sally or who now tells Susan, it's actually Clark, so you know, you can't say the words. But just tell her, it's all of her butt. Okay. Now, in other words, kiss my asses. Is that what you want to say? Good work. We can say kiss my ass. Listen, the young girl in great fish interest, I get need fresh fish, sea trout or group or I'll bring some back for you. Okay, good luck to you. Have a good one. See you later, Tom. Okay. 19 past six on Zeta 4. There's an open line in Dave County. If you're hurry over to that phone, we want to keep the lines really flashing here today. Don't worry. I'm not really sure why. 620, 3600. That's a number in Dave. 620, 3600. Right? Yeah. Okay. Moving right along. The more I think about that, the more I think that could work. Yeah. Yeah. The tutorial one that I got off yesterday show. What was that? I didn't hear it. It's, um, I think underneath your log. Oh, this ought to be good. We'll play this one. We have to redo the break. That's how I felt that one. It's gone. It's got a long title. Okay. Well, I think we'll play it now. Okay. I like it. I think it's cute. Well, I feel, uh, since I'm like a wake, I don't feel like I'm right. I should be, you know, like, um. You know, yeah.

And for so the laws I do, I do unless I can make me a buck or two. I look the other way for you and Ronstal backs me up. President Naps on the job a lot, but I say let him sleep. If he wakes up then he'll find out that I am an overweight creep. I should go to jail and post no bail. It's high time a cheater like me gets nailed. You want a buy a cabinet guy. Then call Ed Meas. I'm a horses. To like the levels on F.I. and I can't believe that this machine I think is dying on a 623 on Zeta 4. Speaking of Ed Meas, I wonder how our other friend Ed is doing. Let's see. Ed, speak to us Ed. Who I think are maybe a bit coming up. Do you believe that? Oh, no, there's nothing on the tape. Holy Toledo. Something just happened. I can't believe that. Why did that happen? There was something there. He saw the views came down the machine. What the hell just happened? I've got the appod open here. Strange things are happening on our board ladies and gentlemen. Yeah, ARB button up. Now we already did that already played a little bit before. Don't you remember as you remember failing you as your Alzheimer's acting up again? I remember. Believe it or not. How is it? Look at that. Look at that. The view is moving. Yeah. The pot is open and there's nothing on the air. Is that strange or what? I think Susan put a jinx on us. Don't you? That's Susan. Oh, no. It's incredible. It's frightening. It's shocking. It's 24 past six on Z4. We can't afford to waste all that time because we got a lot of people here. A lot of things to say. Pop a note. Hello. I do it. I pretty good. It's the engine. It's the engine. It's on the other one. It's the one. Yeah. We go to your favorite school west minister. West minister? Yeah. How come we never get any calls from West minister? You're a pretty meanger following, but we're... I don't know. Oh, like, kind of like some of the morning shows, huh? Yeah. Yeah. Pretty meanger following. Exactly. Well, I just... I tell you that our outgrowth basketball team is going to the state camping to today. Okay. Congratulations to them. Good luck. Yeah. Why are you whispering? I'm not whispering. Is that when you talk louder? Is that as loud as you ever talk, Andrew? No, sometimes. Sometimes. Okay. While I kind of like that, there's something kind of sensual about people like Whisper all the time, you know? Yeah. How's it for already going? It's pretty good. One little ride, Andrew. I know. I just wonder what kind of life I'm trying to find. That's a 308. Wait, is it a spider? Is it a spider? No. It's like a little mismuffin more. Oh, okay. Andrew. Yeah. Have a good day. Yeah. Oh, hi. Oh, it's great to hear from you. Oh, hi. 206 past six on Zeta. If we straighten this problem out here, what the hell is going on with this thing, okay? Counter. All right. I identify with a lot of the music from that. Sarah and that local. Now, one of the things. Yeah, I think we should go back because the mist will be a bit. The interse city and having grown up going over to New York. Quite a bit of that. Yeah. We don't want to miss anything. Oh, he's a jug of 70s and in the 60s, I had a stereo that you could tell us. It was popcorn popping, bacon frying or the drum solo from an agarative. Okay. Thanks a lot. I can have that a little bit later. 24 and a half hours later, he's still talking, leaving gentlemen. Unbelievable. That's all I can say. Great. In fact, that's a lot of other people in the Mark and can say now too. 626 our next call is not from Papino and Spyro. What can I say would like to leave too? And date counting. Hello. Yes, sir. Going from fountain with Park in Miami. I can actually talk English. Wow. Can I watch? I'm going to tell you that I've been listening to your show since you first started on Zeta. And I've become a captain of big fan and would never have sort of changing channels. But. I didn't tell you started talking about Joey. And I had to find out if he was really as bad as boring as you said he would. Well, since you came back, did the answer I think is moved, isn't it? No, I was only going for about two minutes yesterday. Yeah. And you know what Joey said? What did Joey say? Rather have 10 quality fans, 500,000 of the other kind. Well, you know something. I'm glad that Joey's happy. Okay, because that's exactly what he's got nine. Okay. And if he gets just one more quality fan, he's going to have his wish. His wish. Well, by the way, are you going to be at the melting pot Monday in Miami? Yes. How did you know that? I believe that you mentioned it. I made my reservation. And I hope to see there. Are you really going to be there? Yes. What are you going to be eating? I'm going to be eating as much as possible. I bet. You sound like the type. Okay, listen. We'll be looking for you there. What's your name? I named it Don. Don? Okay, Don will be. All of us are going to be there. In fact, now, I don't know whether we have to worry about you or not, but we have some very attractive young people are going to be there at our table. Okay. All good. Let you go. I want to keep my hands out of my desk. Okay, I bet you will. And everything else, too, Don. See you later. Bye, boy. 28 past six. Susan will get upset about that, though, because she doesn't like us too. Well, probably getting caught from somebody from Cooper City. Am I disturbing you? No, I just wanted you to see that picture. David Lee Ross. Oh, I mean, that is. Don't you think that's the definitive David Lee Ross picture. She is just beautiful, isn't he? Cartoon Man of Rock. I mean, if she got any prettier, here's the most disgusting, Skuzzball. He's wacky. Is that it? Like Joey. Yeah, would not Joey is Zany and David Lee Ross is a wacky. Or is that wacky? One of the other. 29 past six on Zayda 4 and the phones are hot this morning. Somebody I know would say. I found your hot. A man who's taste in food is only surpassed by his future taste in music. And we all know who that is. And we'll match it again. We wish the best of Mike Spindelli said he was going to try to call in to dad. Told him please call in. They won't even let him say goodbye in the year over on wins. Typical. Yeah, typical bunch of mung brains had Mark Cune Matty's turn in that place into a parking lot. I still think there's a relation between the strawberry cake and him getting fired. Yeah, let's call Humphrey Bogarton. See if he's still got a steel ball. Yeah, I saw Mark Cune with steel balls. Yeah, and he gave me yesterday. He's real tiny ones. This is a matter of fact. He was rolling them around in his hand. They've been doing it. 29 past six on Zayda 4. And what does it mean three is Ron? Is that something new we're doing? Ron? Ron? Who is this? We're really liking his house. Or just have to make one comment. Or Ron sounds into her at this morning. Yes, Ron. About my name. You comment. We did names on these shows. What do we got a new format now? Can't you do that? That's all you can do. Okay, where were you calling from Ron? Deep. Oh, Dave. Okay. You're kind of making it big. You're like, I got it. It's been done. Joe, tonight. Yeah. We're not going to do anything. Not in my image. A lot of people trying to make that a professional team. We're all good luck to them. Just like the pirates, a lot of people try to make that a pro team too, and it's not working out, babe. We've been starting with the Celtics. Yeah. We gotta start somewhere. Exactly. Well, good luck to them. They're probably last three or four games. They're all people listening. Huh? We need to help people listening. But hey, I listen. I'm not going to sit here in blue sky. Okay. This town is not going to support professional basketball, and especially where the arena is located. And you know that. Okay. You remind me of Bruce Singer, or on the beach. You want me to sit here and show and lie to the pubic. Okay. And I can't do that, Ron. Everybody's asking you to lie to them. We're not asking to knock them out. And we're trying to make this a professional town. Hey, time to show you. Yeah. But it made a professional town. I mean, we only have a dog. It's a bushland. Maybe a badman team in there and and bail it. But we're trying to get a professional basketball team. Yeah. We do have a plantation. We do have a men's badminton team that's doing incredibly well. Run away to the semi finals up in Calgary. There are people on team on a beach. So we're trying to get professional basketball. I'm not going to be good luck to you. Ron, I'm going to continue knocking it because it isn't going to make it. Okay. It's ridiculous. It would be like having pro hockey in Miami. Okay. I mean, I'm a hockey fan. All right, Ron. The Celtics didn't start yesterday. No. Thank you. Maybe they could quit tomorrow. And that'd be a good idea. Maybe they could hang it up tomorrow. Maybe they could take red-hour box cigar and deplanted for him. And the stand where he's seen it. But there are a lot of people who want this thing to work. Well, good luck. Good luck to him, Ron. Okay? We don't need you to set. Ron. Adios, Ron. I don't think Ron is going to be on the year with us again. Still. You know, anybody who is evasive and would only give his name. He didn't belong on a year in a first place. I'd like just a little a tip, Captain Day, for next time. The thing in the next... So in the original... I was really happy that the logo that they chose was the one that I voted for. The one with the basketball on fire with the flames. Oh, yeah. With the little mushroom under it. Yeah. I saw that last time. Six thirty two on Zeta four. And as a matter of fact, they've got a cute little logo that goes along with it. So you can't beat the heat. Isn't that cute? Yeah. Is that right for real or you're just... No, I just made that up. That's good. It's kind of cute. Four-laterdale. Hello. Oh, I have to tell you, Neil. Good morning. Yeah, it's good morning. Good morning to your show on a telephone. Wait a minute. That's just a bit of a... Wait a minute. Charlie Vanu who's voice was what each... Who is this? This isn't Donna, is it? No, this is Mary Jane. Boy, Mary Jane, you sound so much like Donna, I was starting to get nervous. Oh, she's just... Oh, lady. Okay. The lady and red. But I'm going to tell you good. And here it is, Ozzana four. What's that? Well, I have to tell you a common caution story. I... Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Mary Jane, my goash of friend. It's not common caution. It's home in touch. Okay. I say it's home much I know. Yeah, yeah. This is their eating. So I went to the Dellie Den. And I walked in and there's a whole count or full of Danish in front of me, right? I said, do you have any common touch? Uh-huh. I think we have prune and seeds. And I felt like such a jerk. Ooh, cheese. So what do we do to eat cheese on this? Mm-hmm. Well, I ate three. Both of my diet. And I'm blaming you guys. But they were really good weren't they, Mary Jane? Great. Yeah, I love those common touch and hunt like comos. I come to the council mountain to New York and I never heard it called that. Well, I can't believe that they allowed going them up there to the really? Oh, yeah, they're about 10%. Really? Right, trash. And that they haven't caught yet, right? That's a good thing you got out of there. We're teenagers. Great. Listen, where do you guys have to go for those photographs? Where do we have to go? Wait a hell over in Fort Lauderdale on sunrise over by, I don't know where that would. Oh, all the way to somewhere. Oh, yeah, way out east. This is it with downtown. There's like a strip of road there that nobody knows about. And you can avoid new road. No, in fact, the only way you can get to this particular place today, you've got to go by all those expensive car places on sunrise. Uh-huh. Yeah, and you have to put it down payment on Lamborghinis and all kinds of expensive cars already get there. I know the place. I know the place. You know what I'm talking about, right? Yeah, sure, too. Okay, listen, Mary Jane have a great day and look out for those commentations. I will. Okay. Okay, we have a message on here. Jamie and Cutler Raid says whatever you do, be sure and call. You know who's, uh, whether this morning, okay? Uh-oh. Oh, great. Maybe a little message on there. Where's the thing you did for us? Maybe he's going to come across with some money for us finally. That they are here. This is good news. Are the signing. Sheep skate. Wake up with Neil in the morning, but at night call the Florida party line. 9, 7, 6, 4, 400. It's 249. 7, D, 3, degrees, up, sick. 35. I wasn't that nice. Very nice. That's here for Dave Ryder. I always like big Dave Ryder. All the publicity we gave him. I can't confuse with big Dave Mungbrain over here. What's that? All the publicity we gave him. He gave us some. Yeah. So he's not buying any spots, but he has given us a little publicity there. And all those are six people who call his weather a thing. Oh, everybody call. What did he say? Cost 249. What kind of interesting number is that? To call the party line. So those of you out there in Hall and Dale. And Miami Beach. You spend a lot of time on the party. Might as well be talking to somebody while you're doing it. Right? Isn't that what that line's all about? Yeah. I don't want to burst your bubble. But 630. The hiss of interesting sound effects on that line. 635 on Zeta 4. Should I do a tropical and colder? I should. Okay. Like you really care. I can't believe the phones this morning are just loaded. And again, it's kind of like yesterday. There have been some interesting people. And some of you have no idea who they are. What they're doing. Listing the show kind of like Susan here with this letter. Yeah, come on. It's a good one. Yeah, how come you don't call in? You cowardly bitch. Well, it's a hard day for Latterdale. Without your cute little letters that you're sending all these, all these award winners. No, did you send it to anybody good? No. Came, liar Reynolds, B.D.L. and Charles. One good thing consistent. She said it to all losers. Which I like. That's good Susan. 636 on Zeta and up. Boy, boy. He just catches us with our mics down all the time. Doesn't it? 22 till 7 on Zeta 4. It's a new Roger show in a Friday morning. And Monday, don't forget now. Cooper City High. We hope you don't let us down. It would be embarrassing if we all sat around here salivating and drilling. We ought to invite Susan to be one of the judges that day. Great idea. I think Susan's probably real horny. That's why she wrote this nasty letter. Especially the part about the little boys at Cooper City High. Do you believe that? There are no little boys. Susan ought to get together with my mother. And they could talk about what a little boy. They're going to be a little boy. Okay, Bob is okay. No Bob's listing this morning and believe me. There are a lot of us bobbin' on you. You're no little boy. Okay. Believe you me. Okay. Where are we going to a plantation next? Hello. Hi. Good morning. Yes sir. Are you doing great? Listen. I know that you guys are airplane. The movie airplane fans. Yeah. And I just wanted to let you guys know that the same fellow who wrote that movie airplane did for a short time at TV. He'll call it police. Yeah. Because on the air for a while they took it off because nobody seems to understand the sidegacks or anything like that. Yeah, it was a little bit too esoteric for the American public to know about that. Well, good news is that the other night I know you sleep go to sleep really early. But on A&E on Sunday night, I see where they're showing the replay. So if you have a video to set player or something, you might want to take it. Of what? What's the police squad? Oh, it really? Yeah, they have it on late Sunday night. I'm in plantation. I get American cable too. And on A&E, late on Sunday night, I don't exactly remember what time. But it's about 11 or 11 30. Great. It played those police squad episodes. I just thought you guys might play. You know, aren't there only like six of those? There's about six to eight of them. But let me tell you something. They're great. Every time you watch, you see something else in the background. It's a first time. It's just hysterical. I think you can rent that also. Yeah. I think you can. It's never been funny. Yeah. He was funny in the airplane. Oh, he was a hysterical. Please, quite a few. I think you know what, which is hysterical. The other thing about that guy runs from Miami with the basketball. Yeah. I would just think what his problem is. You know, let's listen. If he can't stand the heat, he ought to get out of the kitchen. We've got some of the best shuffle board players in the world down here. And if you can't get into it, he ought to get out. Exactly. All right. Listen. Have a good day, guys. Thanks a lot. Bye-bye. I don't should think of the movie airplane when you think of this. Joe Johnson's listing this morning. Next time you introduce this record, you can say, from the movie airplane. It's the BD's. But isn't it Saturday night fever theme? Not this. It's the theme. It's not this song, is it? I don't think so. Isn't that the song that comes on a jukebox? Yeah. You're going to woman? Yeah. Yeah. It's not the night fever night. Like I said, it was this one. And the other way. Okay. We just broke a rule on Zeta 4. We played the same song or parts of it. Twice in the same hour, ladies and gentlemen, and we apologize. We're going to call our 10-year-old program director during the newsbreak. And see if we can't get back on his good side. Speaking of good side. Yeah. Where are you when we need you, Figuero? My name is Figuero, And I like you to know, Everywhere I go, I hear me the Roger Show. Young men are nice to meet, They bear their chest to me, There's just one problem, they don't show her as to me. I am very happy, living in this country, And the whole bit goes of the new Roger Show. It's the new Roger Show. Oh, the new Roger Show. The new Roger Show. Sally was right, you know, a lot more tackling. It's 1417. What ever it is? What is it? 642 on Zeta 4. My is a little foggy this morning. I have to have a serious heart to heart talk with Sally. She is right. And just a character in a bestorm lately. And I want the audience to know seriously. He does get paid by the cackles, and I'll call it in a rag on him. If you're getting paid by the cackle, you do it as much as you could. What I'm not sure if she was being complimentary or if she was, you know, Ragging on me. That's my question. She wasn't ragging on you. She loves you. I know she does. But she's going to stop eating those chocolates or whatever she's eating. I don't think she's going to be a good boy. She's going to be mad at me when I see her next time. Oh, I'm saying that. I'm not sure she's not going to be furious. She's going to get a good sense of humor on some people we know. I have nothing to say. Okay. 643 on Zeta 4. Yes, he's not. Yes. He's reverting to his old son. Now this could be good for us. This makes the show more like, when you were a total bird bring. Exactly. Exactly. Capling constantly. Yeah, right. Exactly. Never stops. Now, the only difference is we didn't have auto Glenn back then. See how the back up. Yeah, see how the show's expanded. That's your head. Kind of like my waistline. Exactly. Miami. Hello. Miami. My greener friend. How are you, man? When is this? Hey, come on. How are you? Yeah. Oh, hey. Hey, hey. Listen. I don't know if you remember. My wife one day was the way. The call from Cora Gables.

He's head all the way over again. Okay. And why is that sir? You know what those queer's over there. Do to me. I put an advertisement to rent my efficiency. Yeah. It put the wrong number. The wrong number? We can wait for a cause. Nobody calls. Oh, God. But if a newspaper the last day of the advertisement because it was a Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday. We buy it Monday. And we see the number is strong. You know, they do that a lot. Then you believe that. Yeah, they do that a lot. They're always a wrong get the hair on. No, no, no. It was you. And then they give my wife a hot time. And I really listen. I'm the only one that can give you a hot time. He's actually. And she said since when. It's the same. The honey moon. Anyway. It's a.

Okay, so twelve minutes before seven on Zeta Four. Oh, what's that? Why me what was that? That's a little tough anniversary greeting that came from the bag boys at Peelebix. Really? I think we made that up. I didn't know anything about it. We wouldn't want to disappoint Susan. Would we Susan, Martin, and Fort Lottodale at her bag? Hmm. Was all upset about those little boys at Cooper City High? That's right. I'm going to tell boys if Cooper City High. There are big boys. I ain't doing big boy. Happy and Tothane of our show from the bag boys at Public's. I'm at the Jason's on here too. Yeah, yeah. Happy 12th anniversary, Neil. Yeah, I'm a bag boy. My name's Jason. Okay. Moving right along. Isn't Jason starring in that movie with sheer mask? Let's go to a Hollywood next. Hello. Oh. How you doing? Yes, sir. Yes. I have a great topic for you. Okay. I'm going to ask you a question. No, I'm afraid I haven't. Sir, but it's certainly something to think about, isn't it? Yeah. Well, there was a newspaper how they made it. Did you ever see a grown man Stark naked? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Do you ever watch movies about Roman Gladys? Yes. Gladys. Well, I've got mentioned there playing before us. I just, I can go ahead. I know. They had a newspaper how they're making it legal to have female scout masters. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think that may be a good idea. How do you join? Yeah. Big day once in a while you join. Yeah. How do you join? Well, I don't think it's legal because I think I need to nail Rome on all. Do you agree with that? Yeah. That's why they ought to have someone who's rich women be the scout masters. Okay? Well, if you ever look at the, uh, den leaders. Yeah. Yeah. That's true. Yeah. It's like a requirement. You have to weigh over 400 pounds. You've got it. So anyways, I think you guys are great. And you know, you, you know, you should do look up that rating of the phone book. Right. Great. Common name note. Don't you think Susan Martin, I think there might be a few of them in for Lauderdale. Yeah. I think so. I think she just, you know, that name looks good. Yeah. Okay. Listen. Have a great day. Okay. See you later. Good. South broad. Hi. That's one on, um, is that on, what's free? Does that? Andrews? Maybe. Well, I've passed by that. I'm embarrassed now. Not on Andrews. I should have asked him. Should I be able to find out some, some intelligent genius will call in. And let us know. Oh. Oh, you're not. A man who was refused residency in a century village condominium because he's blind and says he plans to take action against the condo association. Larry Tomack 35. And intended to move into century village east. A large condominium complex that caters primarily to retiree to old thorns. But the board of directors at the building he planned to move into rejected him as a renner saying his blindness might present problems to other residents. Yeah. Michael Jackson. It's amazing how this ties together. Yeah. It's your nice. Michael Jackson will receive an honorary degree of humane letters from Nashville's Fist University. FISK for his support of the United Negro College Fund. This way he donated $600,000 to UNCF from a concerty gave at New York City's Madison Square Garden. The last emperor and moon struck our even money picks for best picture at the Oscars April 11th. This is according to a last name. He's up for the untouchables. He's even money. Yeah. How about over the top? Yeah. Yeah. That's in there too. Great. Yeah. You bet. We might have a fiscal and e-burnt thing here in the next hour. No, what though Glenn? I finally got Neil and today we'll let him in. All right. So let's count our blessings. He's he last more than I did now. Wow. Well, well, he admitted to us. Yeah. Because he doesn't understand most of the material. Another guy who does the take off on more down he junior. Chris Elliott. Chris Elliott Junior with all those ugly pseudo buff face. Yeah. He was on last night. Uh-huh. The amazing part of it is that he's been laughing at that all along. He doesn't even know who more down he junior. I just think Chris Elliott's very funny. Even if he knows. Yeah. And I will say Dave that over the top, you know, it's sort of like Citizen King, you know, Orson Wells and Sylvester Stallone. They are sort on the same plane. No. You know who wrote over the top was Sterling Syllofate, famous screenwriters. So, you know, don't knock it. Sterling sycophent? Mm-hmm. Partly cloudy. We better get out of this quickly. Very quickly. We'll fly chance to rain today. Hi today in the Bar near 80. Don't fuma a marijuana. Okay. Lo tonight. Marissa. No full mar. That's right. 73 degrees this morning. Get the say to four. And we're at 653. Let's get what's a through in here. This is exciting. There it goes. I can't believe it like magic, right, Mike? Right, Mike? As absolute weak, correct. Where's it difficult getting in such a huge... I know. That's because we're so popular. Guys, certainly our popular. I just wanted to say thank you for listening last night. Oh, call it up and tell me about what went on. And you just think it'd be unemployed again. You're not unemployed. Now this wasn't your job. Come on. I know that. Looking for a season. Not even on the year. Any more is looking for sympathy. But no, I think it is pretty rude. They send you on your way. You've been in a market for 13 years now. Right. And of course, anybody who ever listened to Mike would never believe that. But anyway, about 13 years in a business. And Mike's a good friend and a great humanitarian. Now, seriously, he's done a lot of really good things. And he gets pre-empted for, uh, Ethel Blum, the total nerd brain without travel show. I was waiting in the wings. I don't think Ethel is going to be... I think it's high test, rather than Ethel. Uh, I think it's the... I'm in the plant guy. Oh, I'm up. Oh, no. Oh, no. Are you serious? That's... That's... And then Steve Conway from Centative. Steve Conway. The guy that sounds like a little boy. I think they... Oh, my God. Here are the stock reports. I think they have the memo. My daddy just lost 8 million in the stock market. I think the memo is, uh, in the, uh, atrium someplace. You've got to be kidding me, man. This mark, QD's. He's going to turn AM into IOD all over again. You know, like a nightmare. The aisle of dementia. I know that we don't share the same audience. WI and CZA, but I just want to thank you for giving me the opportunity to say goodbye to everybody. Well, uh, the children of the parents, uh, in other words, a people listening to your show are listening to this one. Maybe they can tell their kids that they remember when. I know, seriously, what's your the best and I know you'll show up somewhere real quick. And, uh, you know, as I said to you last night on the phone and all seriousness, uh, you know, why go down with the Titanic, right? You know, that just could be nice to have a weekend for a change, you know, you know, the two days is the rather than one. And the best to you and go and and Captain David, I will continue to listen. Great. My guy, well, I want to thank you before you go for that strawberry cake. That was really excellent. I was actually, although I don't think you'll be delivering any more of those who are kind of like that might have been the other straw that broke the camel's back. Yeah, they don't. I'll try weary that broke the cuttings with the enemy. I don't know. Now don't be it. Yeah, listen, take your best all of you. Best luck, Mike. Bye bye. Mike Spendell, who and it will no longer be heard on WI and C.A.M. because they're making moves now over there that are just mind bogged. I think, and Mark, you and I told you, leave it to Mark in in a few months. You can turn that place into a parking lot. See, that you make these predictions. It's eerie because they all come true. I keep telling you that, you know, you're psychic. Did I already put this away, man? I'm so far in a minute. I can't believe it. We played feel I need it locked.

I have about the sink in the, the little executive john in there. That word? Yeah. Yeah, anything. Okay. Some water. Some water. Some water. But you need to get the water. Right. Can you, in other words, you can't do it in here. Can't do it in there. Oops. You could spray a spray it. I had a spray guy. Yeah, that's it. That's it. You want to just kind of like that? No, you can get a spray gun and do it that way. That's what I'm going to do. I listen. I have full of confidence in you, JB. I know. It's just a little too. It's 29 past eight. Yeah, so you know, yeah, absolutely. You're a good. You see, and holy. He's no, he's not anytime.

Oh, excuse me. Well, straight is out of my league, okay? I'm not in the bench straight. Okay. Fine. There you go, J.A. J.A. I just throw it all over in the notebook. I'll pick it up.

Did you order Howard's new video on 1852's turn? No. No. Sorry. Howard keeps trying to make it on TV and others and he keeps getting canceled before he starts. He keeps going about. Yeah. Well, you know, that twisted sister looked when I was a long time ago. That's a problem. I mean, if Howard would put you up a little bit and look more like a human being. I think they might put him on for a minute. Well, now he's starting to pump iron. He thinks he's dropping. Yeah. He's pumping something. No question about that. Did you see him on lettermen a couple weeks ago? Yeah. Pretty weak. Howard's good on radio, but boy, such on TV. Right? Yeah. I'm jealous. I know.

Hey, here's another good one. You're last week we irritated the bird talking about Michigan. This week we can go up to the market again. I guess very upset. Why? I see from Lakeland. He's at Yokele from Lakeland. Where's Lakeland? It's between a hell and a dark place. I was there. Is that down here? Yeah. It's in Florida. It's up there near a game. Nobody's born in Florida. I know. I am Captain Dave was born in Wilmoton. Captain Dave was two. Yeah. Two of us. Two of us. Okay. Which way do you want to turn this way? This way? This way. This is good. Now I can see the cracks. Okay. Eighteen. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I'm telling you. I like this. We can do this here. We have to go. Okay. Have a nice day. Bye-bye. Oh. I'm not ready to be doing all the stretching. Okay. You just go ahead and cut. I'm sure these guys can fill the time. No problem. Yeah. No. No. No. No. No. No. Whoa, Glenn. Yeah. Wow. How many of you are moving for example? Well, it's just, you see, the hard bodies. Three. Excellent. Oh, by the way, there's another movie running on cable. Big Dave about arm wrestling. You know, if you're not really the top so much. I thought yesterday, it's called P.K. And the kid with Molly Ringwall. I love her. Yeah. She's my favorite. Look at that. What a cable. He paid and the kid. I'll be. I'll be. I'll be. I'll be. I'll be. She looks like she's got like rats in her area. What are you talking about? Molly Ringwall. Oh. By the way, why do we want to say how to Carol? We can't federal law prohibits us from doing it. But JT wanted us to say how to Carol, who's his lovely wife. Right. How can we do for you? Do you want to give some other personal messages? No, no. They're also. Would you like to, uh, don't you like to tell my diet coke by the way, please? Would you like to tell a joke? I'm not some request. I would like to hear JT. Something nice? Yeah. I don't want to hear, uh, listen to them. I'll leave. David Lee, well. David Lee, right. I can't. I can't. How about Howard Stern? Yeah. I don't want to hear any of you. I don't want to hear any of you. Howard is making too much money. What does he need to be? What else can we do? I'm not sure. Come on. How about reviewing trapeze? There would be a good one. Trapeze? That old movie is not trapeze. Manicans. Same different. Oh, manicans. That's the same difference. That's one of the most horrendous embarrassments in compete with those choices. Chances, chainsaw mask. I'm not in dollars. Blood and guts, movies. There wasn't no blood and guts and texts. Oh, get serious. Who are you kidding? The inference. There was a imprint. Wow. This time he's like a money outside of his whole show. I think he's hearing him like through the door. That's the worst. I don't know. Anyone that likes that movie. I know a lot of people that they. It was, it was an original movie. Manicans. I'm telling you a part of it. Do you like hearing like that? Let's make a movie. Let's make a movie that the kids will go to. That has a woman. It was on TV. There's nothing else to watch it. Oh, it's a good amount of young boy. Like maybe my tutor. That sounds good to me. You know, his picture was in TV guy last Sunday. Is that Matt LePan? Yeah, right underneath TVK. Did you see that picture? He was right underneath TVK, too. Well, that's a lot of people got excited about that. Where did that baby come from? I thought you got excited about it except him. But that's a lot more fun doing it this way. The audience is getting into this. I'm getting this really incredible haircut. Oh, we hit the mic. That was nice. Yeah, I like the sound of that. Yeah, we've liberated those moves. Like the old WABC singles we're playing the other day. Yeah. I bet you're a way to adjust one second here. I bet you that Ed has something to say about this. I identify with a lot of the music from that era and that low count. And one of the things that you played today. I think it's I've heard it before. No, no, no, no. It's 80, 80, 80. How did he talk about doing a show with a handicap? I mean, this is incredible. Yeah. How did the standard, how did he talk about it? What did he talk about? Well, he always does. He's sure with a handicap. No talent. Anyway, not just a joke, Stan. And if Joe is listening again, at 18 year old, Mr. out there who takes everything so seriously, it's just a radio show. Stan and I are best buddies. This is because he shows sucks. That doesn't get in a way, okay? Are we getting any weight here, Joe? I'm just pushing around. Yeah, that's how many of you started. I was getting pushed around. Like, even in the house, I get pushed around all the time. Do that. Don't do that. Go lay down. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Get out of my way. That's how much stuff you have. I know. You almost think I had someone to taste set. These set when he's setting, bag. I've been begging for five months and it doesn't have to hand it up. Get up and roll over. No, I don't roll over. Oh, that's how the screw. Okay, which way we got to turn it? Oh, this way again. Oh, this is good. Yeah, this is good because I need to reach in here and pull the set. I'm reaching here and put this in. That was excellent. I like the way you do the hair, J, too. Exactly. Get the hair off the board though. That's disgusting. And we got food coming in. This is perfect because you're getting the side of the way now. And then the food will be coming in after nine o'clock from Pasta buildings. Mm-hmm. Yesterday we had Tafri rotisserie. There we got Pasta buildings. Fats was just coming next week by the way. Just mentioned that in passing. Wow. In the way you like that angel here, Pasta? Oh, God. All right. Let me take my brother, boy. Thanks. Oh, good. Wouldn't he be good on this show? Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, God. It's a lot of stress over there. Does he really? Too bad you can't hear this. Oh, I'm just telling you that. Oh, of course not. What's his first name? Cheserick. Chaserick. Chaserick. Chaserick. Chaserick. I can't believe you said that. Chaserick. Chaserick. Yeah. You got a Jewish Italian barber here. I can't believe it. Dave, India, so you guys the way you guys eat all the time. Why don't you have one? We got plenty of money here. No, when you're done. Not a couple of combination, man. I'm telling you. It's kind of like the angel here, Pasta. So what part of New York are you from GT? I'm from Flushing Queens. All from Flushing. Flushing Queens. Yeah. They call it Flushing for a reason too. Let me tell you. That's not too far from Roosevelt. No. You probably lost plenty of money out there. I was in the restaurant over there. I know. There's Carmine, boy. Look out for Carmine. I could go. Carmine's two to five and can't get arrested. Why don't we get into racing because the burger get all upset, right? You could bring nervously. I want to turn you towards this way again. So what? This way. This way. This is what? Yeah. This is excellent. Let me ask Dave. That's big day. Right over here. I used to catch the bus all the time. It catch with us. No, that's Captain Dave. That's Captain Dave. They get so confused. You know what I mean? Okay. I'm the bird. I'm Uncle Neil. That's Uncle Neil. I don't know. That's Captain Dave. Just keep cutting the car. That's a big day. This is a big day. I'm sure. Sixth is sunrise. By the way. Sixth is sunrise. Well, I, to do sunrise first before we, uh, we just reach over your sunrise. Oh, how you doing? All right. How are you? Pretty good. Got to let him in the last night. Yeah. What do you think a tent can't starve you? Um, so glad you brought that up. You mean at jerky at on the end? Yeah. Is it so human? He is the worst. He in fact, same cook was turning over his grave. He did it at some wonderful world. He was. And the way he was holding that microphone like he was squeezing a lemon or something. I mean, what the hell is that all about? I know he's not sorry. And I haven't played a bunch of covers to it. And you know what I'm saying? He's serious. That's the amazing part of it. If it was a put on, it would be funny. Yeah. Oh, my God. If he's the best we got, we better stop the music right now. That's right. The worst. I'm glad you mentioned that because I wanted to rip him. Hey, what am I going to tell my wife about you? And she doesn't like you. Why not? What is the problem? You get to monotony. I'm not telling her that you give her's culture. What do you mean monotony is what the hell is that supposed to mean? She can't hear the sound of us and then see you put down everybody. Oh, poor baby. Yeah. But I told her that you give us good culture and her eyes. Yeah, exactly. But as in culture club. Right. Well, listen, you know, screw your wife. So to speak. Have a nice weekend. See you later. I can't believe I'm not a pencil. What's the Beatles you're talking about? If you're talking about wimpy Beatles, we don't play that. You're not. You're living here. You're living here. I want to hold your hand on his station. Will you? Yeah. We play like later Beatles. Like when they were on heavy drugs. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. I hear such fun. Yeah. So yellow, but all the worse. Sorry. That's the clear. You want to hear that on this station. Hello. By Durned. Yeah. Okay. How about the BGs? Oh. To Wimpy, huh? Yeah. That's a wimpy. This is too bad. I think what we'll do is we'll get Donovan. It will get Andy Gibbon here together. Okay. We'll have like a... What are Maristly? I was curious they will have Maristly. And whoever wins will be on Zeta. You forgot to read your highlights. Do we have any radio highlights? Oh. Oh. Yeah. Isn't that great? The bird just remembered. I just had a brain screen request. All of their own. Yeah. So don't understand when you live in Miami. Other than this show, there are no radio highlights. Don't you understand that? Think about the eyes. You're sweaty for the seed paint. The power line we poured in. Oh yeah. That'll be great. Is everything in a way? Hold on. Hawelile, Arthur, Tiel, and Darrell show. Charpton debate the upcoming school board issue. You know, that's good man. He does do maybe a series of things. And like you can out of here on my way to have my picture taken. That's going to be good. That's it. That's all for radio highlight. And that's it. That's the highlight. What is that? That's it. That's the question. What's wrong with radio on this town? All of a sudden it's nice here. Yeah. Wait a minute. Yeah. Oh, I see. That was good. I like that. You don't take that personally though, be you sure? Because it doesn't make any difference. It's 27 till 10. I'm set up for it. And we have a rectal problem. Oh, boy. Something to do it in the irrigation. They're going to do irrigation. Whatever that means. That's what he said on the area itself. Why are they planting something in there? I'll leave it in the name of the spot. Said, okay, we have to translate for the listening and audience. Okay. Abstent. He's not going to say anything about anything now. Right. Which could be a big improvement. You know what I think it is? I think he ate so much last three days that it came like up here. It was like Adam Zappa. And I don't think he can speak anymore. I think his vocal cords are covered with food. I think he's got Angel hair pasta wrapped around his vocal cords and he can't speak. I thought, what is this story? Do you have any idea what's going on in there? This has been the most peculiar day. What do you think about these pictures? You know how I feel about it. I mean, it's just that why can't they have somebody come in here and do it and get it over with? Why is it that? I think they did that. Yeah, we already did it. I thought we already did that. And then they went into a big, snid about. Oh, JD's are good at it. And the whole big song in advance. I have never worked for any station in my life. I've only made such a big project on a getting somebody's picture taken. I'm about like one else coming in there and taking. Exactly. You know how many photographers they're probably like this guy came in and did the hero. Okay, our good friend, J.T. And I really wanted to pay him. I'm not a cheap skin. I would like to pay him. Pantsomely. Okay, but he wouldn't take it. Now, if we don't, I bet you they're photographers. Good ones out there who just for a little publicity would love to come in here. It's a good Bob Lasky and the guy who did my head shots and does a lot of shots for the Miami dolphins. Yeah, he pulled a picture out yesterday and he said to Dennis Foldris, is how about getting the guy in who did this and he's got a great picture by the way. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Dennis knows about as much about photography as he does about music. Nothing. How about we get down of him to take the pictures, okay? Great idea. Yeah, he can sing. And then I'll come out and then I'll yell, oh, sure. Now, if the three of us don't show up, if we are in unison on this, then they won't get done and they're going to have to do it another way. But how do you feel about it? I mean, they're going to be really peo. But you know, I don't really care. Yeah, I don't really want to go in the first place. I don't want to go because I've already been to Fort Lauderdale once this. Yeah, now the new River Bridge is a blast, but I would just assume put that off for another week, you know, driving over that new River Bridge is a lot of fun. Yeah. Don't you think they're going to pick to place a little further away like me. Yeah, I'm talking about a Jacksonville. We're going to take it a Milton, you know, you're going there anyway. And Milton, there's a great photographer in Mexico, they got the tiger's up there. Or maybe on another planet like on Uranus or something like that, huh? So we're not going. I don't think so. Do you? I don't want to. I don't either. Okay. Well, then we're not. And he goes along with it, so it's unanimous. Okay. And now Peter Boulders, listen. I don't care because listening or not does make any difference. Right off the road. Because he went into a big thing yesterday on the phone. I'll make sure now you guys know, you know. I know. I know there's a lot of things to it. I don't deliver. So what difference does it make? Isn't it right captain Dave? Yes. Well, this is great. And a lot of promises that they that are much more important than taking pictures. Sure. Makes by day. And they don't deliver. That's not like dominoes, you know, they don't deliver. It's a four minute chapter 10. So you can handle tell what's your name in there in the. What is your name? Tony. Well, the spaghetti sauce. Prigo. I'll be thrilled to do that. Yeah. Because he doesn't speak to me. Except on an arurist of occasion. The feeling as they say in the network business is neutral. Well, this is incredible news. Yeah. Great. That's what we got this important card drive home. You can only do so much. Okay. They want to run our lives now. All right. They want to just manipulate our entire lives. Morning, noon and night weekends, too. Mm-hmm. And how many times on a weekend has arrived? The kind of some of my heart going out to these wild places. And just in my own expense. Mm-hmm. Cost of six tanks of gas and a Ferrari just to get these out there. That's what I'm saying. It's up. Hey, look at that. Here's the new new Roger. That's right. We don't have to make it. We don't have to. That's the best thing we've gotten today. I thought I had my heart taken off. Not put on. I can't believe that. That's good. You like some pasta? Yeah. Go ahead. He's on a diet. He's looking the dirt. He's been doing well. Probably one of Michael. Well, but you did. You lost some weight. 25 pounds. You look good. And that is great pasta. The fish is on his side. It is good as he looks. He's got a little cold. But I've got a little cold. It's thick of the microwave. Yeah, really. It's good. Yeah, it's good to eat like that. Trust me. Carrying iron going to eat some of this chocolate. What are you doing? I just can't eat it. I just want to eat it. Oh. Well, you want something here? This is the best garlic cheese oil. Oh, yeah. This is great. Yeah. They're really excellent from pasta. Do you guys all done over there, huh? Yeah. Yeah. We're almost done here another four minutes. Yeah. Yeah. One of those is mine for a week. Are you getting one of those, Mike? Don't they get those for the big news people? Well, they weren't going to get one to our lean, but they couldn't find over the seat big enough for a but. So they couldn't get in here. They. That's what I'm getting, Mike. I had to break the news. Well, listen, we only got three cars at the house. You know, and we needed another one. I wonder how do we get a park that monster, huh? Do you have any ideas? Don't you think people might like a 364. Who for something like that? I don't know. I only know is that we're on a year here doing a show. I don't know. I only know is that we're on a year here doing a show. It comes in. You know, so we beat you. We wedged you out in the ratings and I come in and try to distract us. You get the audience tuning over to Joe. You know. But you guys are still doing pretty good. Can see by liking graduation song, the travel show and the plan show on a weekend, are you guys really doing it? That total travel. Yeah. One of the colleges changing the KAT. Anyway, that's Mike Wolf from our sister's day. Sister will all station up there together into the building. I'm dying a year. I'm at 10. I was 7 on Zeta 4 and I'm half an hour and we played her Mike. Do you mean by shirts? I'm so nervous. Well, the shirts have been kept in David earlier in the show when he was taking the looks and have a great weekend. Gondra's next. Your hair looks great. And my hair does look great. I certainly hope so. And there's going to be a lot of them. And it's going to be a shame that we can't take pictures with my hair looking like this. But we have a lot of other important things to do. And it just isn't going to work out. And that's what's going to happen every time they make these. See, I always told it was a week from today. Which I'm sure I could arrange my life around that. But then you came up with a couple of other dates that they for some peculiar reason ignored the Lord. So we're just going to go ahead and live our lives and look at our list and ignore them. Right? Yeah. Are you trying to ask me, Sean, NEM? Tidford, Dad. And all out of the good stuff. Nobody you doing. Am I not going to play something in here? That's a low-hot Friday. This one is a low-hot shooting. I'm not going that just. I don't know how to. I wonder if that is going to be final comments here. But I don't have a copy of it. Now I do it because I did take the shot. Thank you very much for playing that. Okay. So nice day over here. And it's always pleasure to do a business with you. Now that will continue on Monday. Yeah, to be continued.
