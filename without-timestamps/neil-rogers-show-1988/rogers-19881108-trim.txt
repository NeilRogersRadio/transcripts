Well, isn't I what they well we know that now and speaking of Steve isn't us amazing despite the wait and it says yesterday it says I'm reading what are we just cool okay the way it says it Steve's favorite conservative Rick ciderman that's who's in Glickman of the do caucus campaign on the meaning of life and the word liberal what the hell does that mean debating the meaning of life what kind of a debate is that I mean one thing about Steve man he could debate you on anything like that basket of food there you know he's a good for you is it ecologically safe anyway it says how does president bushland you how about president quail he's the divulges his reasons for joining the bush league and becoming a bushman starting at to this afternoon exclusively on wiod because most of the other stations will be embarrassed but isn't that incredible I'm reading it right from his own promo if I came on and said king was a bush leager he'd get upset but that's right here on the promo well now you can say it this is a case of bush leager okay this is a fun you see and of course we all know the real reason other than hang around with ciderman that he came out for bushes because I'm pretty cocky and it kneel says it's daytime Steve's gonna tell you it's nighttime if I say that it's blue he's gonna say it's green it's just it's just in his nature but now the system and you say can tanker is I'm back basically you're gonna do okay you're gonna confront ciderman face to face to sacked it now I'm gonna get on here like we will every day at two o'clock this I'm gonna confront some of his guests coming oh are you like jack will you already already I'm gonna confront to Jeff Striker when he comes in the fact I was going through my old stuff here and look at this and it's full of mong at I want to get the room messed up but look at that it's one it's a Jeff Striker thing and it's like falling apart in pieces but it's at toll free number 976 Jeff that which from one of these awful lood and lascivious queeny magazines or whatever that's from so anyway that's coming up on the cane show he gets him all does I can't believe see I'm gonna be in look at all the mong like crackers just fell out of that all over the table that's really strange okay now let me give the numbers out and we're gonna take it easy today we're not gonna be under all that pressure like yesterday and everybody I talked to said they really enjoy the show but I just felt like I was going about a mile a minute I don't know why but it was all these we were taking a break like every two seconds what week yeah well it's gonna break for longer than the show that was the incredible part but then again we got all these political stuff and that's gonna go away slowly get it together and slowly one day we'll intimidate them and tell them you know to cut this crap out anyway let me give you the numbers now even though already all but to Palm Beach line are lit and there's something

a number of teams there are a number of people concerned citizens voters who like to know what they're voting for this is merit retention of district court of appeals judges they have no opponents running against them their names merely appear on the ballot and there's been no information as to what they have been doing on the bench for the last eight or ten years in which they've been making hundreds of rulings people are not them voters are not them and they want to know what they're voting on merit retention is in fact reappointment for life it is and every six year election in which the voters are supposed to go down and re-elect the judges without knowing why they're voting on them thank you very much for your courtesy and listening to that okay thank you so much for that was so terminal and she wanted to be on first she must have been calling from WNWS it must be sabotaged that I don't mind or what now listen I mean we got a lot of these civic minded people you got to

to say you hurt okay let's give that Palm Beach number again because I can see that's gonna be our only problem is gonna be that Palm Beach line see I can always find a problem on the phone even though they're lit up like a Hanukkah bush I can always find some little bit of consternation on the phone six five five Wiod in the Palm Beach is for all you cheap skates you don't want to talk to us when we didn't have a Palm Beach line okay it's free okay if you got it it's free I think you finally hit on it I think that'll work I don't think so I don't see anything you're going on yeah that

if you were working with those people over there you never have made it trust me a lesser man would never have stuck it out as far as I did if you know what I mean I know you mean it's like they lifted a standard pound last at the right after chest there you go um tell me if Steve is talking about the meaning of life today is you're gonna talk about the life of Brian tomorrow could be could be yeah he's gonna have a reccytamin reviewing the life of Brian more as a matter of time we know he's a fascist you're all saying it I'm not saying it does happen to be true but I'm not saying okay go ahead you play the pork smoked dough I sure will or nearly we don't as you know we don't take requests but because you're such a good guy I appreciate and you sound like you've got an IQ of over two we're gonna do it or at least three or four okay have a great one get to bye bye okay 1035 everything just going along so well isn't it you just waiting for that one big desperate explosion okay April Wartham's got a news update we'll come back in a flash on 610 wio dip you know what I just discovered what I've been cranking up the headphone level which is what I know instead of the telephone level for the cars on the overhead and that's why keep saying the phone levels are so low they are a little bit low but I've been cranking up the wrong pot and that's why this is worked so well just like sitting on there it's been bouncing off anyway it's 1039 21 to 11 on 610 wio d and our next cool is from Miami hello yeah Neil does the bird ever talk one does the bird ever say anything no he just cackles sir he gets paid by the cackles oh no no okay let's go to um what would he like me I don't know a lot of hill hello hello sir yes sir I'm glad to hear you back on the A.M. Thank you sir and I'm glad that they are going to let you break loose and do your job and do it well yeah they're just oblivious here sir they just say anything we want to do they just go ahead and do it and uh mine your own business well I've been reading the articles and they said that basically you can do what you want as long as it's when within the SEC rule that is correct well can you tell me what did the other station tell you you couldn't do uh anything other than hello and goodbye that so those were the limit everything outside of that and maybe an occasional how you're doing but other than that sir there wasn't a hell of a lot left for us to do well what was the reason to point my boyfriend's back in that it's not a bit now listen I want you to understand a Portland main mentality with the one of the uh corporate uh executive douchebags from Portland came down one day and heard it on the year and he felt that it was promoting homosexuality okay what for waterdale what what I mean let's hang out of the downtown sir don't tell that to mere cocks okay because I get very upset yeah that's true but I was amazing listening to it yesterday that they would pull that it is oh yeah even the local management and even the local management uh was embarrassed by that but again you see when he's Yahoo's from Portland main every time they'd come down they hear something or a group of things that they didn't like and go ahead and pull a card out you can't do that you you know and it just got to the point where was ridiculous because they've got no sense of humor they're terminally not just homophobic they're like sexist folk but like they're all unix up there or something oh yeah just they believe that sex is not a part of anybody's life and that even satire about is just a verboten you know and I used to start cranking up the microwave and getting all hysterical and though it just couldn't be done so what about Jetboy Jacko I've heard worse things than other songs it's a song there's nothing wrong with it it says something about having a good head on your shoulders or something like that and then the bomb was right exactly and the other weird thing was at the records they played the rest of the day said much worse thing oh yeah they still play they still play records that it got some of the seven band words I wrote one the other night I heard that Steve Miller band record that's right S. H. and you know right and they claim that they don't play it but they do when he heard with your own three years you know so they just have a real conflict over there and that whole company just run by a bunch of knee-and-a-under-thousand from Portland and you know the amazing part of it is when we were on AM a year ago they we would have meetings and they'd say hey that fine we're behind you there's no problem with this and no problem with this. No that's not they didn't figure nobody was looking we had a nine share of that. One is then these people from Maine started coming down some of the corporate defense bags and and everything they have never sprayed so okay so that's the bottom one yeah and I can't believe that data's still ready day way somehow like that you know I'm not going to say thing about that because I like to you need to grate that for us but but the fact is when you leave a bunch of your stuff behind for them to start playing it is tacky I mean we played some of the old breakfast club stuff but it was done as Santa I was done as a joke we weren't using it for serious in fact if you heard any of it it was a joke okay but um I don't know I get on just delighted we're both tickled with that to be out of there and it was a real the last few months there were the most depressing thing and I remember that to me the day that broke my back was it a came back from that great vacation in Hawaii and they go there and here was a stand had been blown away and across the program director waiting for me at the airport and yet all of these memos and you can't say that you can't talk about stand and you can't talk about the AM and about the papa papa and that was like the beginning to end for me I just got worse from there well stands a great guy and he's a good talent good great show I mean I still listen and he had great numbers and great demographics but again they don't relate to success when you do well they get very nervous like a one yeah are you gonna like uh let me uh you're gonna let Ed call in or is Neil gonna people call in brave briefly okay sir oh come on very briefly that is that's an excellent wonderful day sir okay let's go to this hate call for the bird on a fire I can't wait for this hello ever Neil yeah yeah you know what I want to ask you Neil yeah I want to have to land brain is on you I mean Jeff Charles should be on you Jeff Charles Jeff Charles was on a station filling in for one day and they dragged him out of here kicking and screaming okay or Charles is out of his mind sir Jeff Charles said here and promoted drug use for four hours one day okay he wanted yeah that's his opinion to come on here and promote use of drugs that's his opinion his opinion if you want to hear Jeff Charles move to Roanoke okay because I think that's where he's gonna show I don't appreciate being put in the same as Jeff Charles' rage Charles maybe not Jeff Charles I don't know because this is gonna work out because it's 1044 and I promised that kid yesterday and I'm gonna win him his 20 bucks okay 1055 sometimes when we go away do you get the feeling like we're never coming back you ever get that feeling wow anyway uh the nice talking you will be back right after the news uh just a little joke okay let's go to Miami next hello hello Neil yes sir you like this degree with that earlier oh I think Glenn is great thank you sir yeah let's have a let's have a big vote on that oh okay since it's election day how much wonder where you found them well that's under a rock in there that's a weird story I've never been to that you know I need to have the reason I called Neil I'm a morning drive person yeah and uh I know you'd like to watch the numbers uh you're rating numbers if you can get some statistics on uh accident I predict there's gonna be an increase in accident on the road people not getting their morning laugh with you they're gonna be taken out their anxieties and wrecking into each other well that's good that'll make the insurance rates go up and to make the insurance companies happy and probably get a lot of business and scrape so who we what are we supposed to do in the morning now that's a good question I mean there is nothing sir have you ever heard about the mystery picker no you know I never listened to my court season I've tried this week uh thank you been over here these are so they're required to you have to give me a chance just counting in I'm passively we'll not do the job I'm trying but I you know why don't I

surely and you know once in a while when I get a chance I record you so he can hear too good excellent okay what you ought to do it is Joey have like a cassette we must have a cassette recorder right yes you did that's what you're recording on why don't you have him record like a little message you know like maybe you have a hot trip at TIP at Calder something like that Joey's 11 years old by the way no in fact he's 13 and 13 in the hand uh-huh she just six months ago he was all up yeah that was one thing that he wanted to straighten out but he never got a chance to but he said oh it's okay

life and say hi to Joey okay okay no okay thank you thank you thank you love you bye it's funny everybody adjusted to us being on in the morning and now they all they want us back in a morning we don't want to be on in the morning okay we're sick and tired of that craft we don't want to get up at 430 in a morning coming and pretend to be happy and awake and alert in all that garbage they how would that stuff we did pretty good at pretending yeah we put on a good accurate all big lie okay we hated every thinking minute of anyway don't forget Henry Burrow has got a special election wrap up hours and I from 10 to 11 on Wild so if we want to get depressed tune in here that oh yeah it's got to be very depressing because we know that Bush is going to win and anybody with an IQ over 2 is going to be upset about that yeah and uh as far as McCay and Mac are concerned is anybody going to be happy regardless I mean you know forget it that's just a desperate situation anyway news upcoming at the top of the hour will come back with hour number 2 at 1105 here on 610 Wild thank you so much 1106 in Wild and here we are ladies and gentlemen with our picks of the day this could be the beginning of a gigantic no seriously there could be some people on therapy retiring by the end of the week the birds picked today in the seventh race and he always picks these chalk you know like 3 to 5 and crap like that whirling rainbow with gear right in the seventh race which is picked uh in fact it's the best bet by Slater in a Harrel yeah and everybody picks it on top anybody can pick 5 to 2 in a morning line okay my pick any eighth race because I like the name of the horse cold spot cold spot yeah you know you're seeing a Rod Riggas actually oh yeah I have a cold spot this morning 8 to 1 in a morning line so there could be some serious muxmeat on that when it comes in is anybody pick it and now look at this Slater I didn't even see this Slater's 3va in the racing form all pick cold spot really he consensus pick on top but it's 8 to 1 in the morning line so I'm trying to pick a price and I wind up with something everybody picks well you know mine they either come in number one or they scratch and of course the soon we're going to have our own mystery picker on a show we don't want to be undone by our own mystery picker and uh he's going to work on both nostrils at the same time why don't thank Joe a Tasty Rotisserie for the really nice plant that he sent over look at that nice great and I got a really strange Johnville up here that's got these wireless connectors I have no idea what this is supposed to be who said it says given the mission maybe he can save the show I don't know what that's supposed to be all about some jackass not there any audience okay let's go back the only open line on the board is in bokeh if you move quickly where we just hung up about 45 minutes ago at 278 Wild that's too 78 Wild let's go to Miami hello yes sir uh I've been listening to you and WNF State and uh you know it amazing me I always uh are able to land on your feet somewhere else you yeah just like a cat like you were on the cat too I remember yeah it was on the cat yeah and you remember then yeah sure I was being only 27 but I've been listening to you since I was eight what yeah okay that's your arithmetic whatever you say pal but anyway uh just uh this is the first time I'm gonna pull uh do I dare ask who you're voting for I well actually I called to see if you can get me a suggestion because oh it's still up in the air for me I I don't know I'm taking a long time I think I'm gonna flip the coin really I'm sure I'm a republic yeah register let me ask you this question at any time during a campaign did you really hear bush discuss anything about any issue I don't he talked about the pledge of allegiance he talked about uh he talked about Willie Horton a lot in about the furloughs and he talked about the liberals and he used all kinds of labels and words and uh and he never once really addressed the issue he never talked sensibly about where he's gonna you know cut the budget he never talked about uh anything really of any substance about the elderly about the homeless about any of the issues about the drug situation he'd been in charge of the drug thing for last eight years and it's been a disaster but that I could anybody of good conscience vote for bush really yeah well then you know I know he's gonna sweep the state of Florida but how could they do it but the caucus into uh that much of no I disagree with you do caucus wait a minute do caucus right a bed campaign but at least he was talking to issues okay see that's his problem he and his advisors didn't understand how done the American public are and you know that you really have to deal with all this extraneous crap they try to talk issues and that was their mistake well I got to admit push blade a dirty yeah and if you want to caucus and the caucus try to keep up with it and if I want to clear conscience or because you asked me vote for new caucus because not gonna make any difference in Florida anyway but at least then you won't be able to say three four years down to road that nobody can blame you okay yeah well uh I just well okay I'll take it for first but now listen you're gonna do whatever you want but you asked me for a suggestion that's to the way I feel about bush did talk about the whales yeah I didn't make the whales a couple of times meant that okay he ran away a lot of a campaign they're not they're not the uh uh then I'd it my priority but okay I'll try them oh okay okay okay I hope you have a clean conscience alright I don't want you to lose any sleep at night when you have Dan Koyala heartbeat away from the presidency a kid who's just an absolute total evacueous douchebag you know you want him to be the vice president sir so what you're gonna go out and vote for today we don't want to get heavy and political doing okay but we do have

reasons yeah well let me just say this to you the last thing in the world that I want to do again is bilingualism I know Sandy likes to do that two or three times a week but I did more shows on bilingualism in the early part of the 80s in this town and you can shake a stick at and a bottom line is that people who want to be a part of the country are going to go ahead and they're going to do it and people that want to use a language is a weapon are good no matter how many laws you pass they're still going to be rude and they're still going to be do it and it it doesn't make any difference how many laws you pass I know I have a rise guy but I I blame him most of the area um I position people around here they're Spanish like the media they're they're on the media in the radio stations they you know they're terribly biased and in the influence of these people we can turn out I consider him stupid in the sense because you know if we consider ourselves um patriotic right we do it we come on that when we become American citizens which are really doing a special destination see and if it's a common fact that it's hard for nation because you know nation they're separated by languages become weaker you know we shouldn't not allow that and I think it's the when I hear the radio stations in Spanish I'm only listening to it now because normally I'm listening to English and that's really what they don't want yeah they want to use the companies the companies that companies that said to help with pedaling appreciated we accept your apology wasn't really necessary but your sentiments are our decent and we thank you yeah I wanted to say is I never denied them a Cuban but I do realize that we are in that perfect and I also know the American people are not perfect either that's I sure I stepped forward a step closer to being perfect and that's that's the job that I would like to take okay okay okay thanks a lot bye bye when is this and it's a holiday okay it's a 12 13 at 610 WIOD we're gonna get a lot of calls in his car we've also got those very important things that the Nick turned over to us that Jeff Charles piece which I can't wait to hear and Vanna pick Mike's nose and all that good stuff okay let's go to Miami hello hello Neil how you doing okay best of luck here on the new station hello bird how you doing good okay great gonna make it short just want to tell you the information I heard the conversation in the quail family this morning yes sir the quails woke up head sex missus quail turn to Mr. quail and said then you're no jack in it oh but it's cute thanks a lot pal okay now that I've heard that about 400 times but it's still cute and if anybody should know okay let's go to a four lottery hello hello for lottery of be gone are you cereal okay let's just say they how it for a lot of day let's go to north Miami Beach hello hello Neil yes sir yeah I'm a first time caller and I was wondering if I could just share a few things about my experiences I wasn't they rude when they bomb the post headquarters remember that a few years yeah I sure do and nobody's talking about that but I sure do remember it yeah I like to share something with the voters who are kind of excited about the caucus or bush I was about 500 yards from that when it happened I remember digging people out of there being the things bad things I remember right afterwards the French people sent a contingent one of their guys from back in France came out I don't remember his name that might have been mid-Ram he came for about eight hours eight with the soldiers talked to them prayed with them stayed with them helped with the cause help with the injured then the English guy came he helped off to the soldiers he was there for about six or seven hours they an ambush came he came off his plane he expected the first squad of troops went in the hangar for about 10 minutes and back out got right back on his plane went home I I can't really understand we'd want to present it like that yeah well you know I don't know why the do caucus people I mean I know he mentioned it once in one speech they haven't talked at all about that and about the fact that Reagan sent those guys over his like sitting ducks over there as a you know allegedly a peacekeeping force where there hasn't been any peace for 5,000 years and you know again it's Teflon thing it just slides right off a Reagan it slides off a bush and don't confuse the public with the issues man they don't want to hear about it right okay thanks a lot yeah but I bought but I was depressing but it was true you know but you know that's not our thing okay it's not our thing because unfortunately in this country in this vast wasteland of intellectual uh neanderthalness if there's such a word it's a hopeless situation okay really is to try to appeal to the American people with thanks or with the any kind of meaningful dialogue you're wasting your time man they want to brawl they want everything to be a fist fight like that heraldos show I guarantee when that show airs whatever day it is when he gets his nose broken giant rating it's gonna have like an 80 share okay see him on ET last night no but the big bandages on that should have a bandage like all around his head okay like a mummy like the invisible man pro 19 at W. I. O. D. let's not get too model in here let's go to align six is a mobile hello yeah yeah how do you feel about being on the same station of Steve Kane because you know you two have had words together I remember when you were on the 9.40 a.m. Steve Kane would say that you were a liability to the station because of you know an advertising liability uh and uh he made other remarks as I remember that you don't have a guts to talk to him in person and of course you had words about him that I've heard that's a business sir that's a way goes yeah yeah so that's he that was one true that's why don't you want to answer to the question or not yeah what I said was not out on true I don't say things for dramatic purposes okay I say things because I believe him but the business is such that an assessates you I mean you know you're always gonna wind up working with people that you had run ins with in the past especially when you're doing controversial talk it's the nature of the business okay yeah right okay and Steve's gonna do his thing and I'm gonna do my thing and so far man we're not gonna what we're getting along great and you know if you're a pro you gotta do those things okay that doesn't mean I'm gonna you know go out on a town with him and Rick every night but that's one of those things all right thanks a lot okay I think there are a lot of people in the audience and need to get that out of their system okay I mean right away you become a hypocrite and you become you know your credibility is shot that's a lot of baloney okay you do what you've got to do and when people come along and they give you an opportunity like to get out of jail practically because how we felt at the other station and they give you the kind of deals that they made with us you just don't say no unless you're crazy okay and didn't I go through that thing about all of us in radio and TV being a little bit on the hoary side then I mentioned that earlier in the show but none of that means that we're not gonna continue to stop talk about our pal Steve of course like uh every day so I'm love for George Bush he knows better than that he knows there is in any way in a world that he ought to be voting for George Bush but because I'm for New Caucus he of course and also the influence of his good buddy Rick uh he's for Bush he's out of his mind to be for Bush and he's people that say well I'm scared to death a quail but I'm still gonna vote for but what logic is there in that well we've had as many presidents die or be assassinated or be uh have to resign like Nixon whatever the hell happened and all of a sudden the vice president takes over and you why don't put a dummy like a Gerald Ford for example good example good example good so couldn't walk too gum or brushes teeth at the same time excellent example yeah well that's just what we need right and the amazing part of his Dan Quail makes George makes uh Jerry Ford seem like a brain you know okay so what does that tell you but I'm not gonna let that influence me you know come on Steve get the serious cut to be it all right but hang it around with that guy tied to your hip for too long another mobile caller in Palm Beach hello hey Neil how you doing how you doing I tell you this market has absolutely no sense of humor I know they don't have to throw you show exactly just like they used to say it's just a

the sleep that's while I'm yawning suddenly falling when I'm half asleep someone unconscious somebody not just waiting for a thrill is one that was surprised with some rises someone on the table there

we're just commenting during the last break that the stuff that we used to play on AM almost all of which is over here now is the stuff that really people were excited about and the ACN was like you know frosting on a cake but most of it wasn't all that exciting okay well glad you're on AM and AM go new look thanks a lot okay take it easy boy boy that's what it's like 7-6 and it's something yeah at least it's exciting but a lot of people are dragging back to AM because what's facet with the exception of GTR which is over here right next door and they give a re-ups said if I didn't say that but no they're doing great they have a gigantic number and they got to great in a graphics and they're doing fantastic but I mean generally speaking and I know the sounds hypocritical they're saying well it was on FM you know said AM was dead and it was it was about like a you know a breath away from death and Zambai heard W. Snoos like me if you can pick it up on your radio I can't pick that station right I keep trying and I can't get them now they've improved it a little bit you know like once in a while here but you know you hear a couple of the letters but for a month there was like one who knew you were cool right you couldn't hear it and they were still doing like a three or four because those old parts man it can't change their dialer like stuck on it frozen yeah this is been an animation okay we got a mobile in Miami hello hey Leo how you doing great you know I have to say congratulations to W. I.O.D. for letting you play all the songs you know when you were coming back over here I said yeah I'll probably play a few songs but I never thought you'd be able to play my favorite I.95. I guess yeah I got news for you're gonna hear that every day I am so happy I really need to I mean you know like I call you up once as data and I said Neil the show doesn't look good I was being serious I said Neil the show doesn't sound the same and I guess you just couldn't tell the truth well no I used to how you used to animate that how many times did I go on and scream about the fact that we were being humiliated and degraded and muscled and back I thought you did that all the time but you can only go so far if you want to keep getting a paycheck you know I did this like three months before you came out of the closet so to speak on that particular subject and I thought maybe it was just me and it wasn't because the show really started to degenerate and now let me tell you something I really owe an apology but again it's not my fault because it's the restrictions they've placed on us six weeks eight weeks I was posting isn't the word but I was like vegetating yeah I mean we go in there in the morning and we sit around and look at each other like you know are we ready to blow our brains out what we do today what can we say I mean when they take away 90% of your material man how they how do you do a radio show it's true because I have to say this you know when you went over and made the shift the first thing I did was go out and buy myself one of these radios that work in the shower because I was so addicted during the ten to two slots I didn't want to miss anything and that landed for a couple of months and then all of a sudden you know what am I doing oh wait, I'm fine and now to have you for four hours a day I just have to say I get into WRD it's great and please do one more thing for me Neil so very first thing I ever heard you play when you went to uh uh to ten a month before it was a bad brag. It's probably safe to play. If you're not a fan, I'd love it. I got it. I got it. Okay. Don't panic. That's great. You're thank you so much. Okay. Have a wonderful life. Thanks so much. Okay. Wow. Boy, he was just foaming at the mouth, right? All right. Let's take our break him in it early because then we can come back and play this because it's not really that long. One twenty three a WIO did. And let's get as many of these calls in before we go. Let's get tinkled on to the power we got. Change other where 60 times before the end of the day. Let's go to Waterhill. Hello. Hey, how you doing, Neil? Pretty good. Dude, what's going on? Hey, birdie, what's happening? Ah, it's great to be here. Good. You guys are great. It's good to have you back again. Yeah, if you're back in a real world right, we come home. We've come home, sir. Here in a big city, Poundor, Bay Village. Get about it. Hey, listen. What about sweet bull, you think we could talk to her again? Yeah. You know, as a matter of fact, I found in old nine hundred in fact, when Steve has Jeff Strikor on his show. I got an old Jeff Strikor thing in my briefcase. And of course, if anybody would have a Jeff Strikor. Ah, hey, just bring that in. This guy to this come on. Yeah, man. Look at this. Did it. The 976 Jeff. And I don't know if this line is still going or not. But we got all kinds of filthy stuff. Okay. I can't wait, Neil. I told that. I wish we were to see that. So we'll see if I can dig that up. Okay, Poundor. That'll be great, Neil. Can I pull somebody a douchebag? Go ahead, Poundor. Do a speck. Okay. Thank you. Bye, bye. It's interesting what gets Steve in here, isn't it? Yeah, Jeff Strikor. That's what he's been doing too much of this meal, Bond. He's nice. He's dressed that he's still. I got him to this for a, he still looks pretty damn good to me. Okay. Okay. Handsome guy, but he's dressed. Great. So let me tell you something. He looks better with clothes on. Okay. You really think so? Trust me from somebody who knows why I mean I've seen him. I mean like that. I mean like that. I'm sorry, but with a clothes on there, he looks really good. But not as good as Rick Siderman, but almost. Oh, God. Are you ready to have it? I'm on a gear. Is this promo just to give me upset? Hey, is today is the day? Is he on every Tuesday? Oh, so he's like, what's your name from the Harold, the, the, the, the, the, the, Linda, Lucy Cooper. Oh, please, he is he like kind of the Lucy, kind of Cooper. The, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, he's very, very excited. I think I would make it a bit pair. I like that comparison. I like comparing me to Jeff Charles, you know, or a bit of a sucker. Yeah, that sense. Anyway, I'm hoping I'm going to dig through all my old, but you have it. I'm so, I mean, I'm right here, but I used to listen and you'd have really good. This picture, look at that. Look what they sent me in the video. That stuff will start coming in again. Look, look, look, look, I came in here already. We played boys once, sex and a more. I know I heard that on the way. I know, I heard that on the way. I'm telling you, the stuff is coming back. Now, this is coming in with Jeff Strikers, Steve. With Jeff Strikers, we're talking, this is what you're interested in. We're talking maybe Amber Lynn, maybe? Maybe Amber Lynn, where there are a couple of the ladies who are. The blonde that was in Debbie does Dallas. What is her name? Now, she's very attractive, okay? Debbie does Dallas. She was Debbie. Oh, I don't know. I mean, I still don't think you're here to go. I don't know. I only know the names of a couple of the ladies. You know, three or four of the ladies. I don't know. Most of the ladies are like anonymous. Not all of them. No, no, it's not that. It's true, but most of Mark had like an omni. Then there's, what's that? Oh, babies. Her name was Bambi. Bambi would. Bambi would. Bambi would. That's Debbie. Well, I get a good girl. I get a good girl. That's her memory. I know. I listen to you. Well, the regular film, so all the time you're right on the money. Well, that's so much useless crap. It's just crap. Oh, it's some of those women are really old. What's the land is old? Sake is gorgeous. But she's old. I didn't really. I mean, Donna Mills is old too, but she's still good. Look, I mean, I don't hear through a little bit. What do you mean by old? I mean, your sake will be about 30. I would be about 30. 40. Oh, no. What are you thinking? Parker. No, I think I know sake. She's going to be mid 40s at least. Okay, Parker. The long. He's been around for a long time. And the long time. The film's a long time. How long? Well, I don't know. But she was probably made of 10 years of the week. Yeah, well, now she may be 40. But in the film, he's not 45. Exactly. She's like anyway. And there's another one. I have a Martha Thick of her name. And she's like, I like to be part of the group. To be part of the group. Taboo one was just on like a label. I agree. I have a lot more in common than we really. Absolutely. Similar. Tate. That's a lot of these. Yeah. It's what you'll have to leave me out. Seriously, I'm telling you, Bambi Woods was incredible. She was a very attract, which is why that movie was so popular. There was a big movie. What was it doing right? What is it? I like most about it. You say, you're pretty. What I see at attractive woman. I don't just look the other way. I say, hey, that's a really attractive woman. If I were so inclined, I might, you know, I can understand. I mean, I feel like we're a bit credible. Right? I think you're right. I agree with the power you. I put that picture down. It's a story of your credibility. What credibility? He's got incredible boobs. And she's got a beautiful face. And she's, you know, cute. Traktor. She's very cute. Oh. You're going to kind of an opposite of fee becaits kind of. Yeah, who's kind of like boyish and boyish. Oh, come on. That's what's the criteria. He's got to be boyish and boyish. I'm like, I'm more like, I'm more like, I'm more of a breast person, which is like what I like. Park. You know who K parker is? I know. I know. I like that. She is just this. What is the word Pendulous? Well, I like that. I think that sucks. As the Pendulous is in the boyish. True. I mean, it's like, you know, we were going along. We haven't really. Not that we show her everything was going on. I found out if we were to be heavy duties right away. We're going to this pornographic. This is something. Volkhead. You play. I love every week. I played Jetboy J. Girl yesterday. Yesterday. Yesterday. It's too long to play every day. How about it? It's long. Nick's going to make a recording of it for me. Why does he have to do that? It's right here. Play it in the cassette. You know, in my car. Oh, I see. I'm not. I'm going to play it on the air. I mean, it's the music you want to play on the air. I don't know. I don't get a feeling wants me playing cards on the air. I haven't had a personal discussion with the better, but I don't think he wants. I think he wants to preserve to be the heavy topical guy. Come on. I just can try. I think he wants to preserve the integrity of the cane format. I think he hasn't. I mean, I don't want to do that. I wouldn't show like to once in a while just do a little off the wall. I'll play like the I-95 record and stuff like that. But still get mad at me. Tell us and tell Bill that my result is okay with that. These great numbers that are going to be gigantic. Tell him to take a chill and go in the lunch room. I'll give it lunch and what do you do? You sit down and you just say, when he, when he tells you, I need some help on this. I look straight in the eye. Look at me. Just take a chill. Get out of my line. Find your own business. Take a hike. And you'll have fun being back at the W's News every month. You're a lot of good luck right now. Okay, we got to do a break here and people were the match any Coleman. Get the mouth and salivating. I need something going on there. Okay. Pembroke Pines. Hello. Hey, me, I'm doing great. It's great to hear you back on the A& that's the same thing. Cutting the lady off there is one of the funniest things I've heard come from. I've never really gotten to listen to him too much. I'm number seven on the A&M conversion list for you. All right, let's hear another time. Yeah. It's great having gotten to listen to A&M probably since I was 15 years old back when that's all there was. Yeah. But I got a question. It's where he thinks that you get kind of curious and he just won't know. And now I like to say I haven't gotten to listen to the other A&M guys that much. But I've been listening to Ranaria a little and a little bit of C change. Does Mike Ranieri does he just flopped all over the Mike when he's talking? Yeah. That's what it sounds like. It sounds like he's double-tonked. Well, you know, when you got one finger way up, you're just a leaning kind of the other nostril on the edge of the mic. It's a very delicate balance and he does it incredibly well. He really does. He does a good job. But I've touched this one thing I was curious about. I'm a steep therapist. So it kind of hit me as funny and disfounded like he's hit it all over the place. Uh, wait a minute. What did you say? Oh, you're a steep therapist. I thought you said you were steep therapist. Well, I tried that too because if you were steep therapist after the performance you just put on in here with that picture man. I have a lot of trouble. Yeah. I never have steeper on my couch, thank you. Okay. But you're right. Great to hear you back in the same with the bird. Good to hear you bird. Thanks a lot. Oh, boy. Okay. Yes, Steve was an interesting guy. How do you want to do? Who is that the worst you want to do? You I O D and we'll go to Miami. Hello. I don't know. All right. I have to go and hey, right. Hi. I really sought too much to go. I left for Vegas for a while. I come back and you guys switched over on me. Yeah. We sure did boy. We got out. We broke out in the middle of night. Yeah. We waited till you were out of town though. Yeah. I was in the car. But I just couldn't stand. All right. First of all, I've never heard you on the AM before. It's my first time for that. Great. So now that we feel like you're like number eight. Number eight. Great. I was going to go to like about eight and I'm on the F. And I think you guys do sound a little bit over here. Great. Yeah. Well, we feel better than that. Yeah. I've got a lot. I've got a lot. I've got a lot. I hate all right. Audio. I'll read the lyrics. What is Larry King saying? One, four, three. One, four, three. One, four, three. And of course, Larry I'll be on here exclusively on WIOD tonight because he's a great American. And he'll be right on after Henry Barrow and that special tender will have an hour. Election night. Oh, man. It's going to be like in the gestion. Isn't it? Probably. You can feel it already. In fact, by 10 o'clock, Henry will be in a position to wrap up all the other stuff. Because I have a feeling that by 730, all three networks are going to take any little bit of fun. And any little tiny hope, you know, the polls were like narrowing like the last NBC poll was only five points. And the last CBS poll was down to six points. And this morning, Harris came out with a poll I was only four points. Wow. And a margin of error is like plus and minus three. So if you really want to get into that school of swishful thinking, I mean, it's possible it could be within a couple of points either way and it really would all depend on who turned out. But the problem is then you look at the electoral college and you just say, hey, who the hell are we kidding? Just a country of Yahoo's and Rednecks and good luck to us all. All right, Boko, I think is on eight on what the Palm Beach line. Hello. Hello, Neil. Yeah. Great. First time caller here. Good. We've down here from the lake. From where? The mistake on the lake. Cleveland. Oh, yeah. I remember that. Yeah. Is that what they refer it? Yeah, they do that. They do that there. Yeah, that's what it's on. If I'd like, here he is. The only great lake that you'd naturally walk across from Cleveland to Buffalo. Yeah, you could easily do that. But anyway, just wanted to call him. I used to listen to you every day. I went to Cauder in the morning, but I can never call. But now that you're in the afternoon, I can call you. Yeah, don't you think that this time of day is more conducive to people being able to call and do things and get involved as opposed to the morning where I mean everybody if they got any kind of life at all, they ought to be doing stuff. Right. But the only thing was everybody down in Cauder used to like to listen to you talk about them and stuff. They all would listen and now they can't. Yeah, well, I don't think he listened from 10 until 12. Three. No, but they're out punching their brains out. Yeah, they can listen to me between races under Sony Walkman. Anyway, I had a hot horses today if you were going up there. Are you cereal? For sure. It's not whirling rainbow. Is it in the front? No, it's one in the fifth race. You know, fifth race. The rainbow is in the seventh race. But if you get, like I don't know if you have time to get to the fifth. No, I'm not going to get over there. But let me show you. Should we put it on the air? We'll not get a price way down. I don't care. It's very easy. OK, go ahead. Let's just test you. Well, let it go. OK, it's in the fifth race. Number three, just in the jab at 10 skit. And he's three to one. Jab at 10 skit sounds like a Polish horse. Yeah, he is a Polish horse, but who's riding him? Who's riding him? I'm Rodriguez. Uh-huh. And I know they really like him today. OK, well, listen, there's our first chance for our plungers. Hank can get out there. They can all make a fortune. He doesn't show up on sports talk. He'll over-sport on, OK? All right. Hold on. I want him. OK. Hi, Neil. How you doing? You're good. How are you? Great. Hi, bird. All right. How come, um, camp day can go with you guys? Well, you know, midday show. I mentioned this yesterday. When you're doing a midday show, it just doesn't require as many people as the morning show. And that they weren't going to hire, you know, a whole bunch of people to come over here. So it just didn't work out. We should code of because he's a great guy. He did a good job for us. But it just wasn't going to work out. Well, that's OK. You guys are great, anyway. Yeah, we think so. OK. Thanks a lot. Thanks. Bye-bye. Bye. Wasn't that nice, huh? Yeah, you know, you know, Stan said one one time ago and Stan used to be on that that I was unhappiness. Every caller said hello to me to, you know, and that's not true. Who said that? Stan made sure. And it's not true at all. And people generally do not say hello to me. And I have no problem with that at all. It's fine. But today, like every caller is saying, hi to me. It's incredible. Before you go, could you do one short thing for me? What's that? Just say freeze major. Miami, vice, you're under arrest. Absolutely. I'm not going to do that. OK, that was for you, Stan. As I know, you're monitoring right now, Stan. We know you're listening. Well, he's, OK. This thing came true. One day. What's that? That everyone says hello to me. Well, you'll see how long it'll last. Yeah, today only I'm 244 at WIOD. The Steve Kanger with two o'clock sports talk at 6.10. And Henry with that incredible. What is going to be so? I know everybody's going to be tuning in and listening because they're going to want to find out about the center race and about all the local races. And they're just a glyoly amendment. All the amendment 10. Get out there and vote no on amendment 10 folks. Trust me when I tell you. Yeah, I think you're following what I'm saying. Remember, Neal's right about everything. Yep. And on this one, I want to get on it. Everything except President, I'll tell you how desperate I am. My briefcase is still got my old Mondale Ferrari box. You talk about really having guts. How many people do you know walk around with one of those? Even Geraldine is digging hers. Okay, let's go to Miami. Hello. Yeah. How you doing? Great. I'm a switch. You're a switch, you're a switch, you're a switch. We don't want to get into your problem. Well, listen to me. Yeah. And my friend Mo switch. Mo. Remember? How about curly? No, you remember I called a, a Glen. How's your fish? Mo. You know, he's great. I do have a fish name. I know. And he's swimming upside down, pal. I called the rest about two weeks ago and I said you're at last with Ronnie. Yeah. I'm sorry. Okay. I'm really sorry. I accept your polish. He still thinks it's Ronnie. He just enjoys it now. Right? Yeah, let's try. Yeah. I've glad you guys are, you know. Let me just say, let me say this. If I sound a little bit off balance during this call.
