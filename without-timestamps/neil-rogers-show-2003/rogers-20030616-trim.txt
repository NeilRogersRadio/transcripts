Oh What is the story in that last hour we working on is that it? That is it that's the a log for last hour. We got some very bad news for your boys and girls Two minute breaks though What do you mean by that? Let's you want to look something together I'm sure about we'll do we'll do best does or some or what we'll do is we'll play that Joe roasting over and over again I think that's a great idea is a lead in for the of a hurricane game Now what are the odds here's the bad news what are the odds that Texas and a soft Florida team Play twice on the same night and the score the Texas team wins 13 to two in both games what are the odds of that Huh two what I'm saying Texas Rangers 13 Florida Marlins two and on the same night the Texas Longhorn's 13 and you have ever heard cool Two Woo so the bad news is we've been given a bum steer. We're pretty pissed off a death about it too Although it did seem good movie over weekend. We're not talking movies He saw a wreck we're moving a weekend. I have a fancier from some even like recreem well too bad your taste blows even though it's a good fact So we got the ball game at two o'clock now one o'clock we thought we're getting like an hour and in fact I put a hex on a hurricane specifically In fact, I put the fix in on a 13 to two score specifically so we'd have the hour off today We don't get it damn it but the mad dog who of course we know is over were all right. Yeah gets to show off today and the hump are also gets to show off So they took a poll unbeknownst to us this started Friday morning is that we were telling me yes On a QAM website which you could put in a phone booth and stuff people more people than ever check the QAM website It's pretty embarrassing although we do like there a staff Huh Josh what's his name cord? Good man Come on up and say hi Josh or least you know So I know anyway, they work very hard but nobody pays any attention to it because fourth nerds are too busy playing golf and playing with each other and watching most hairpiece in our website We'll call you the radio station or calling your radio station, but no, that's mode. That's doing that So they had a poll. What's your favorite show on QAM now keep in mind? We're not talking about our website We would never do that because it would be so self-serving to do that, you know? We've very self-serving but I'll say this I think it's pretty bush-leaf for them to take that down before we had a chance to hype it like certain other people on his radio station Thought on a sand But I told for Reldah having a little bit just to make damn sure that there's my close personal best friend But at any rate What do you give me a look? I'm looking what's your favorite show on QAM is what they asked and we didn't get a chance to a load the poll I we got to gotten you some votes on there 256 votes they got you got to be kidding me man 200 we could get that between now and 10 30 okay in fact you know what we're gonna do I already printed this up let's do the same poll. Let's put our most on it, okay? Huh we're gonna flex our muscle. Yeah, let's flex our thing a little bit okay. There you go. We flexed it We'll take exactly the same poll call up Eric beiner boy column up get that tab of crap on a phone Wake him up turn his hands over What's your favorite show on QM now? may sound a little bit self-serving now here's what they had on a QAM website Wait till you're this Neorodgers 74 votes 29.1% This is without us having any chance being made aware of this okay to give them a competitive advantage the sports nerds, you know Jim managed the mad dog he did well Right 19.2% 49 votes Joe and Mark who I'm sure height the living crap out of it all the way to minute one could they have done that last night That's right cuz they're on Sunday night.

They're not buying that they part There's two and three minute breaks. It's fine. It's okay. It's acceptable So anyway, you got the pull now. Do you know what it is? Hold with it.

I always got a lie about crap The fact of the matter. Oh, the pull is up already the fact of the merits for a simple mo That guilty is starting to be like he was the last hold out and now he started to turn on him because he can't take any more of that pompous that condescending crap And bener boy was the first one to notice the nuances of this a few weeks ago. I started mentioning it And now it's like there's almost a war of battle going on in there between the two of them So Joe was I guess just mentioned that in passing right everyone has everybody in a building is aware of it and so Mo's calling in and he's got a straight now just like that thing with a beast he didn't fire the beast Where do you get your turn up?

I don't know what's happening on this do you think everybody is voting on it now or something? Now what did I just start to show with okay you're right about the facts whose the facts is getting as bad as the callers getting I'm in the just now I just get through opening the show with a show roast thing that tirade about all the votes are on already Look at that there's 44 votes already.

He said is two kids are a real pain in the ass. They're out of control. They're like evil. They're like the demon seed has grown for us to beat Todd up And probably could she probably just step on him Squash him like a net Let's refresh this thing again. I got to get used to this computer again We're not talking about movies by the way. I won't give you the results from the pool. We took over the weekend And then we're not for the next 14 shows.

One other there pissed off about Although Duff did watch Reckley and verdino with a weekend and loved it In fact, he said it was so good and inspired him to pop a whole bunch of different colored pills. I bet they were like rainbow colors See the big thing they hadn't he was look at this that this thing is loaded so heavy now with votes that I can't get on it now Are you getting on it?

I had a book of Brian will call in I don't want to get into that. It's nobody knows to tell the truth I guess that's the one Gary Moore was the host and so So they they bring out a cow on stage and the deal of it is best Myerson who's got her evening Ghana and the kidney car Lyle they're gonna milk the cow and they got this broadener's gonna show them how to milk the cow and Gary More is standing there. Well needless to say the cow And a little accident anybody ever heard the term cow pie or cow pile And Gary says we take that thing off here right now get it out and there and of course they're all in his Storics and I don't know what they'll happen because we didn't see the rest of it because it's live TV and A college is there he got nervous you know, he let Lucie Piler to you know what happens around here all the time In fact, Moe I noticed there was like a bad stain when I he was standing there talking to the bath Bad stain On those lime green pants see when you dump in your pants and you were in like the lemon yellow or lime green pants It shows real bad moe.

I hope it's volunteer Joel at British Airways says just thought I'd let you know that our mutual friend Helen from Erikaana does retelling after 32 years Her last day will be June 28 she works days now doesn't get a chance to listen much But I always tell her that you mentioned around the year we wish you're all the best and amen to that Joel She is the sweetheart. I love her Helen and Eileen and all the nice people that they're can to the good luck Helen. I love you sweetheart And she's one of those people she gets around she and her husband they travel all over the place they go skiing they go all over Over the world So hopefully she's not being squeezed out of there by air cannon all alone can only guess because there haven't have enough A few problems like their stock is about 75 cents Our here's the fact it says the Joe roasting is pretty hilarious but my question is what was Joe? Rose talking about the flip most freaking wig See these people are coming in a lot of people though listen on a weekend Maybe they're out of town They don't hear the beginning of our show which we're not too happy about now that we're back tended to I did see my billboard this morning Oh, still says nine new one, but that's okay. I'll take it After four and after five years of no publicity whatsoever. I'll take the billboard. Thank you Even if it's got midnight till three. I don't care Got that big over me push With my bulging eyes and my big fat pupic And I'll take it. I didn't see most billboard though when it was usually right on my ass I wonder if that means I I don't know So I've been out either thing that flipped Joe Rose Put them off the edges that mo called an off the ear because Joe was just mentioning I'll say for the last time about the fact that you can see the you can hear it You can feel the tension it's palpable on the ear between goldie and mo in a morning show, okay? I don't know I'm spending so much time on this because in the fact most of our people Listen that show anyway, but it's just good. It'll kill some good time plus when I get any calls any like it They like the gossip. Oh, they love the gossip. That's a number one favorite thing next to movies Next to that And so evidently mo got all been out of shape and he's got see this thing about calling in other shows that just drives me nuts That's light bulb radio well Mr. Kane. Yes, Mr. Kent well, Mr. Kane. Yeah, it's like that What's that bit we got that AC in bit that minced stool thing? Oh, premanced stool syndrome. I might have to play that well Mr. Inderogga You know and that's what they used to do that's the own call on each other's show on a year getting of these contrived arguments Eddemy just crap fun for 90 year olds And that's what they used to do well. This was the same kind of thing. I guess mo call them this show And I know and trying to straighten this one out and there's no tension well, so even only he called on a bat line Talk to whoever was producing Joe show Saturday and wanted to get on the air to refute what you would just said Well, Joe's like Joe made a good point. You guys got three hours of his own Monday through Friday We were in the morning, but nevertheless somebody's awake at that I don't think he called with the intent of actually getting on the air, but rather just to talk to Joe to set him straight off the air I says the story I got in other words to bitch him out off the air right Right lucky did that last time with Ferrell correct which it turns out that that is a true story Even though he bit somebody else out for spilling the beans about that somebody was like he's always like Joe says like always calling the station to say this or that to this one of that one Yeah, like the time at the geldi was doing a show when Moe was on vacation see if I'm on vacation Even like I can I can pop it up in my little studio at Gerado and hear it. I don't listen. I don't listen. I find better things to do like pick my nose But he's a call in get to be stopped there. He's unprofessional, but you know, I mean he's not even in here He's not even doing a show and he's got you know Get yourself a life fine. I'll say it again. I do you I know we got a lot of golfers out there good luck Yeah, it's all I can say good luck here because if you're playing a lot of golf it means to me you have no life There may be a few exceptions for where I guess is one of those who's missing something okay He's got a hot girlfriend. He's got a lot of action He's gonna himself a big pen house suite on the South Beach He's gonna be driving two or three cat-lacks before they have to be doing six to ten He'll be making really serious big bucks. I'll have big numbers in there. What's that to like right? See, I'm kind of when you have the original sheet because you never gave it back to me the pull that they took the sports QM sports nerd pull You never give that back to me. Here's the pull that we're dealing with no success In fact, maybe we'll just do a pull with three choices on what do you think? Eric we're like that This is our real poll today. The other was just for fun just to prove a point which we did What's the one place you've never been to that you must see before you croak Prague Cuba Cuba New Zealand or Montana, but that's all we got so far because either the none of this poll Or they just they don't give a crap or they're not in town or they don't like us anymore I don't know Carlos wants you to add Hawaii. Oh Okay, don't go to a Oahu. It's beautiful, but it's too crowded go to the big island go to a Maui Go have a Maui Maui But don't go to a Maui. Well, you're not going anywhere. What am I talking about? You couldn't afford to get like you know three feet out of the ocean given 20 years I'm giving 10 to 20 just for putting a time jica piece on our website yesterday gets 10 to 20 So they had only 256 votes on IQ M thing the whole weekend What's your favorite show on a station? Neoride is 29.1% mad dog What's the punty game percentages when you deal with this? 74 votes for a show mad dog 49 Joe and Mark 41. I think I was loaded for railhead 40 Mo had 34 also loaded up hand-cad 10 and then he came at six votes out of 256 that's the way that turned out And like I said when you only got 3.9% of the sports nerds keep in mind that wasn't That was an a sports nerd show as they were pump of that we didn't even know anything about it That was done behind our backs obviously intentionally Because they know damn well that the result would have been a little bit different Are they turned it right but anyway my I'm hoping I'm mooted so and even even with him going under this morning and hyping it Both are the good guys go for the guys with honesty and these things I guess they did Which means anybody but you Mo the mode they hear I'm demoling realize huh you mode Oh god, maybe that explains this frustration 26 past 11 at five I can see I'm just out of no maybe won't even take any calls all week.

But you just say Hawaii which means any of the five islands are you know or all or a mix and man with that leper colony. Montana's got one. That kind of once not a 22 votes. We have a lot of votes if we had some misleadions on here places that the people want to go but we don't. And you know what we don't care. We got the hurricane game and her case comes world series.

I went from nice scenery and there's so many people are crazy but I enjoy the heck out of it. Where did you go? I went to Rome, went to Plermo. I spent a week there it was pretty nice. How did you like Sicily? Sicily was very pretty. Very nice people were okay but the drivers were all nuts. They were like four cars in a row with a two-lane road. You get a drive like I'm already ever making it. I've just put Italy on any specific place. I have no Italy fine. You really shouldn't have you been in Florence? I know I have no.

Yeah he ate three meals while I said here and watch them. What are you talking about? Maybe that was his order. He was shoveling it down. See I love you for real but don't be a pussy. Don't be intimidated by these people. They talk of good game and they'll intimidate anybody who lives near their crap. The only reason that we got ants in this building. Other insects. What would he give me a look? The phone screwed up. What do you mean by that? Like it won't go off of speaker phone. Welcome back Neil. Welcome back to QAM where I did see our new engineer this morning. Jim pardon me for wearing a stupid thing. Yelton. Yelton. It is a ridiculous for that pony tail.

I can't you my means I need to be going back real soon. Twenty-till noon at five, sixty we got to her a cane baseball game from the College World Series at two man. I'm telling you all the haze of place you'd like to go. I would definitely like to go. You would. I'm afraid the people are beautiful. I have friendly. There's a pretty decent nightlife there. There's like a lot of hookers out there and at least there used to be anyway. Probably now since we got this new right-wing regime. The hookers are still out there but Ashcroft covered them all up with like a doylice with stuff. Hey, Kevin and I would like Ashmothas. I'd take till film noon. What am I doing back here? This was a bad mistake. This was I mean everything since I've walked through that door. It's just been one nightmare after another. And you know what? I think you have a better microphone up there. Is this not sound a good? That sounds good but just you know when you have something that compared to that one sounds better. I have a better everything up there. I have a better mic. I have a better equipment. I got a better studio. I have a better time. I have a better life. Some buddy. It sounds muddy in here. Maybe that's because they muddied yours. I've seen one sounds so squishy on here. It might be it. It didn't help. No, it doesn't. But when you do the forlvoys. I think that's the that's the cast me out man. George does for rale all summer long and the voice too. You know the Neil Deos keep on rolling out from Tom Lim and the Joe Prieto are good friends at Hellet Pony XGMC. Here's Neil Deos number one going on. Right now and you know what it is? It's this corporate disease in here again. You don't hear me coughing and choking in Terrarri when all that SARS running around. I don't do that but here it's in this room again. And like I started to say if they weren't so cheap and they got an exterminator in here. If they got a good buddy Steve from ATM bugger. So the turn of ATM. They get all the bugs on here. They wouldn't have to be put to bitch and forl owners no food in the studio no food on a table. It's a bunch of bull crab Greg. Stop trying to brow beat people. He's your adult's not about your sports children. That's why he was speed eating. Yeah. He comes in here and it's it's really something to watch. He's speed eating because they won't let him eat in his studio. So he comes in here to Neil's kitchen and drugs and there's both. Pops a couple of pills. Stuff's a bagel in the corner of his post. This is often not diners and drug stores. I mean I guess there's one in town. Absolutely. Anyway, it's a hell that I was starting to tell you about the great Neil deals right now.

So, the deal with the monkeypox is some asshole had a, a Gambian rat as a pet. And a Gambian rat bit one of those poor little nice Prairie dogs and give it to monkeypox. And then the Prairie dogs started like hanging around with people by the mispets and they started past along the monkeypox. Here we go, here's some for you too. No, so you're right, it was the Gambian rat after all. And who, why would you want a Gambian rat? They, they showed it on TV this morning on the news. It's a rat, it's a big asshole rat. Big ass rat. So kind of thing you want to kill not bring home as a pet. I'd rather have a copy borrow myself. Oh my god, big RNA needs some help. It says my place to be would say I thought that was a pretty simple question but I always think that animal is wrong. I placed this sea would be Fenway Park in Boston when the Yankees were playing and the Yankees would be to crap out the red socks. Well, that's nice to be Arne, but it's got absolutely nothing to do with what we're talking about.

New Zealand's winning hand down but who I catch enough. Now that you took my way off of there. I guess Aris probably never been to Hawaii. How do you know? I don't think he's been there. You're asking me, I've time you talk to him a couple minutes. 10 seconds. New Zealand 25, the one place you've never been to that you must see me for your croak before they stick your ass in the box. 78 votes, not too many because we don't have enough places on here. New Zealand 25, Hawaii 19, Cuba 9, 9. You don't want to either one of you probably took you can get a help of package deal. Been there done that. No, you haven't not as an adult. No. You could go to Toronto and of course we wouldn't let you out of the airport because you might have something contagious. But then you could fly right from there to Havana. How do you press it? Oh, Cuba 9 and maybe you could take a side trip to what's the tower Ali on lives? I have to go. Oh come on. Oh. If there's anything worse than a spik it's a useless spik, you know? What's the tower he lives? I'm not going to say that word. What is it? What's some frothy word? Sounds filthy. Camel hump? What? They don't live in camel hump. Don't forget paying the attention to him. What are we going to do with him? I dumped the bitch right now. New Zealand 25, Hawaii 22, Cuba 9, Prague 8. That's where I want to go. That's my vote. Boy, it's bad in this room. I think it's the SARS. No, you're not succumbing to it. No, seriously, the corporate disease in this room every time I come in here, I start coughing and gagging and choking and puking. Maybe it's the obvious. Italy 8, Montana 7 and Tahini 4, out of 84 votes. Italy 8, Italy, the well. Here's a good fact. I like this fact. Are there something in the air in here? Oh my god. Oh, you're laughing. I'm serious. There is something in here. We need to get an exterminator right now. In fact, more. Maybe he left me the poison gas. That's what that was. Maybe he was hiding in this pants. Maybe he sweeds it out of his back. This morning, the poison gas. Because I can smell it. Hmm. So, isn't that something about guilty doing her checks every day and then do it? I even this morning I'm coming to work and I hear they come back from the 730 break and he comes back and I'm thinking, that's a little bit unusual. You never do that. Whoever the lead guy in the show is, he drives the show. He comes back out of the red joins after the break and he's the one that says 735. I can add whatever. And for the last week or two, Galbi has been doing that every day. So, very obviously he is sniffing around. He's looking desperately. There's any openings that he even said this morning. If there's any openings that publisher Walmart, he'll take it. So, I guess it's not a very well-kept secret. So, that makes it easy. See, the thing about Moe is he always denies the obvious. Today's Monday. Well, no, I have you know. It's, you know, he always denies the obvious. You're going to lie about something. Why about something that nobody really knows the answer to? Right? That'd be a good place to start. Yeah. Like, I think he's about 66. Well, I'll have you know, I'm not so, you know, your age. We don't know your age yet. When is that swing? Others you have come on. There's an old cocker and old Jew. Just came in with our food. Don't I don't breathe too heavy in here because there's something bad in ours. I think they planted something in the room and then they're going to blame me for bringing SARS back. Monkey SARS. We aren't exporting SARS, okay? It's all in the hospitals of everything. It's the coast is clear. It says, I used to think the most pathetic callers to show what a one's at home on the phone for hours just to insult you or Georgia say something stupid. But the truly pathetic ones that are one's who apparently can pick their own nose without calling you to find out how you pick your nose. In other words, Neil, how do you attack to buffet? Or Neil, tell me what to do in Vegas? Or Neil, why do you like Amsterdam? Or Neil, why don't you like Amsterdam? Or Neil, I was thinking of having a live can you tell me what to do? I can't stand those callers as this fact. So I guess what? Oh, what a coincidence. And we have the great misfortune of having them live in South Florida. Why in Earth did you come back from Toronto? If you like to sweat, I'm sure there are steam bats in Toronto. Well, speak of the bats. Good. A couple of days ago, I saw a very interesting show on one of those discovery channels and it was about Pompey. Do you want to go to Pompey? Yeah, actually. I do. At least you won't pay any big crowds. And they showed the ancient well actually they scut I don't know how they got over to the Coliseum. They showed something about the Coliseum. And about the bats that they had underneath the Coliseum. And I was thinking, oh my god, can you imagine what those Romans were going on in there? They'd be fine. They'd be father of two of jealous making believe that he was born in the wrong era scrubbing a lot of leather, a lot of leathered up the Romans. Make them a stick about it. Oh brother. What did they have to do with Pompey? I'm not really sure but it was on the same show. Sure, they had it going on there too. Maybe that maybe it wasn't really to volcano after all. People with some other kind of eruptions. Squirtin that blew a bigger tad in eruption. Speaking of a tad, here's Jeff Cohen from the pizza law for their food with my lunch. Thank you so much. Nice to see you. All right. Yeah, good. Oh, Jesus. If you want to just fill that that would have been a disaster. And he dropped my fork on a floor, you're an idiot. But you knew look a lot better without that. You look good as matter fact. You look almost human now. He's cleaning up his act. People used to start vomiting when they'd walk in. They knew the food was great, but they'd see him and then they'd see the how about let me see your fingernail. Oh, I am so proud of this man. You know what? Clear. All of it. I don't care if he's painting his fingernail. He's trying to keep that image up. You know, he wants to get all of both sides of the fence. And more ways than one. Is that what it is? Don't sit down there by the way because I'm not going to open my because you'll say something filthy on the ear again. We're not we're not putting anybody on ear anymore. Even though George keeps inviting people in that I don't want here. Where I love who? I'm not I'm not because you're up in an intention. Oh, I don't remember. Well, my inviting in here that you don't want in here. Anybody anybody that you would invite in here is always somebody I don't want. When I do want somebody in here, it's lost cause. What are we going to do about you? I jumped the bitch right now. 567560, pound 560. So how's business? You have house things in plantation? That's the big question. Yeah. Are you serious now? Takes time to build up like it. It's a bad location because nobody can see it from the street. I'm talking with my mouth full. Good sausage here, man. Greater. Tieded sausage a little bit of light sauce from heavy cheese. Hmm. This is what I need to clean that damn disease out of my throat. Whatever is in this room. So I guess you must have heard about the Joe Rose Moe conflict. Didn't hear about it. How about we'll be playing that again a few minutes? Evidently, uh, Gully is getting ready to bail out in that morning. Show now that they shoved it back into the middle of the night. We got these making a lot of air checks. We're going to get that out of here. Brother getting's good. Can't stand moan. No, Moe, which you can hear right here. And so now, evidently, Joe was talking about that Saturday. Joe Rose being the good guy that we all love the former dolphin number 80. Joe is great. See even Jeff Cohen likes see if we had to take sides. I don't want my start to push anybody in a direction against Moe. But Jeff just said, didn't you hear him say? He's over to had a two size. He takes Joe Rose any day. Joe Rose is awesome. See there you go. I rest my case. Oh, say if you're going to if you're going to take issue with people like the beast with the underlings. Yeah, nobody cares about that. You know? You want to start picking on Robert Greeper or poor fat sack. Nobody really is going to go to back for them. But when you deal with the big time, you know, when you deal with like, oh, good Joe Rose. And the Humper. Well, then you're treading on some real fat ground. You know, I'm talking and like for real. Like that thing about don't you ever can buy a dress on the air. Don't you emm and then he denied it. Why do people lie like crazy? See, and of course those are the people always pull their stuff behind the scenes. Be sure. See with us, we come on here. We lay it right out there for I don't hold any of it back. If I don't like somebody else tell you if I like somebody, I'll let you know. Like Jeff Cohen is a good guy. Okay. Can be a little bit of a pain in the ass. Be a good guy. Great. Great food. Well, by the way, don't give any free food to what's his name anymore. No, no, seriously. I want to ask you a question. This is the honest. No, I don't speak to him anymore. I don't want to do with them. I don't care. I don't want you to give them the no more free food based on me. Good. Start charging right. Look at that. I just mungle over regular price plus 50%. To make up. Yeah. So instead of a 50% price for him, do you have 150%. You're not listening to me. I get I opened your mic up even though I got to do a break here. I don't want any more free. What is that? I haven't seen that yet. Yeah. Look at the package. I'm a sport in there. Man, I only wish. Holy cow. What is this? What is in the sound of this? This yours? Troy handed that in here. Well, what what does this already? I've just got through doing the spot. He hands me to do the lights stuff. And he I just got through this by this Trace Bradford man. He's just the same same as he always was. He's a good guy. But there's two problems with Troy. Okay, no, what they are. That's it. But I like Troy. He's a good guy. You know Trace Bradford? No, I'm with a magnifying glass, you know. This is what they give me for copy and it's a jerk of a place. See Jeff. He'd even Jeff is telling you now. What a joke it is. Can I go to the spot and we'll talk about you're not giving any free food to the murmurs anymore. If you want, I'll even tell the story on here again. About the Toronto experience where he drove me about 75 miles. We could have been to Rochester by the timing. Got through driving to a deli the the size of this room. Where the food was from. Hunger. And the ambience was from hunger. And then finally when a check came, he passed over to me just like he was passing down a vingo card at a vingo game. Just passed it right on down the line. And then how it comes to good plans to me taking his whole family and even strangers. It sounds girlfriend, which I don't even know who the hell she is to Ruth Chris. Yeah. This is a way some people go through life is on somebody else's tab. That's the way it'll come back in a certain way. Do the break then you can rip by your friend Rimmer. No, but the idea because somebody is my friend, you should feed them for free is bad. Anybody anybody I know charge a mixture. Two minutes till noon. No seriously. You're in business to make a living not to like entertain my I'm not doing that Steve King crab Mr. Ego. Oh, well, I'm a friend of Neil good. Oh, it's double.

Don't try to change this subject because you're sucking them out with a murmur. What is it you didn't even know who he was? Am I right? I want you to tell the truth. Don't be like moe and start telling tales on here. This is the honest show we wanted her to. I didn't know who he was. In fact, when I saw him on TV calling the game, I called him up and said I had no idea how professional you are because he did such a great job on That has nothing to do with what you're talking about. No, but I've never had an issue. I'm not gonna knock his reveries or free and even when he gets to discount he always says no, it's not necessary and everything. His wife is a wonderful person. His wife is great. If it's free, it's me. Yeah. That's his mono. If it's me, I'll give you a great place to have an inexpensive state near your house. By the way, Jeff Cohen says everybody who listens to the show is Jewish. And say everybody. You said most of he just got your number sandwich. You said most of the people listen to the short Jews. Maybe the go aim don't like you. I don't know. Maybe that could be it. Maybe they see it like huh? Yeah, you like him because he gives you free food and it's what's what it was. It was a sense of today's sensational. Hmm. He's almost as good as what I get in Toronto. I'm a good friend besides the pizza locked in plantation on Nathil and sunrise Boulevard. I want to hear a good place near your house. Yeah, yeah. The original steakhouse snowen burgers. Have you been in there? No. How old smelly burger? 18 bucks. Is there really a place called Shmellon burgers? He's involved in it. Yeah, it's called snowen burgers. He and I had an episode of years ago. Really? Well, when I was doing you in baseball, that's years ago. Years ago. Right. And he was the coach. Football coach. And they had the U of M old timeers game. What do you old time? Randy Garra all the guys used to play for the hurricanes a few years before came and played the regular team. Exhibition game. I remember those. That's a long time. It was on a Saturday. And what do they do? So they have the what do they call the spring skirmish game? The hurricane game. The whatever they call it. I think it's about spring skirmish. Well, I mean like the admissions states are green and white game. Whatever like that. Right. So they scheduled at the same time. And so needless to say our attendance at the baseball game was a fraction of what it should have been. And usually was because in those days you know Ron Fraser was there. We had gigantic crowds. And it was not good. And so I went on a year in my show Monday. And I was ripping that. Mick Irner maybe it was during the broadcast. I think we broadcast the game. We did all the UM baseball games. And I ripped them in ass. So this is not intelligent thing to be doing is competing with yourself for fan support. So Monday afternoon I'm at home the phone rings. I pick up the Mr Rogers. This is Howard Schnellard Burger. Yeah. And you have a problem with us? Yeah. True story. I said yes. And I pulled him what it was. And while in the future I'd appreciate if he had passed that talk with me direct instead of saying these things on the air. And that was the end of then. That's the only In cover of our head with Howard Schnellard Burger. I've never met him. Seeing him and never met him. He's a hard ass. So anyway for eight. I mean he might be a great guy but he's a hard ass. He smokes a pipe and he anybody that cleanses a pipe real tight in their teeth. They're uptight. You know what I mean? I haven't seen pipe smokers for years. I'm surprised they're just ah! Bigger. Oh my god I can't believe he just said that. Oh for example you I guess you don't hang out with Mo. Jorge fills in for the pipe smoke of this morning at nine o'clock. Okay. No. Then no. See, we didn't even know what he meant by that would you. Nope. Jorge fills in for the pipe smoke of this morning at nine o'clock. That's just Mo's way of being a funny dirty old homophobic fart and you didn't even get it. You didn't even understand it. Oh now that now it's ahhh now it's starting to fit in. Yeah. Okay, now what were you saying about Schnellard Burger? We're just talking for 18 bucks at somewhere on there. You got a nice big filet mignon every time I've had it. It's cooked right the first try which to be is important. Comes with vegetables, salad, a potato, whatever it is and it's awesome. And so I'm spoiled now because there is it on a clearing in uphill. Really? Cleary in uphill. Yeah. There's a real restaurant in Navajo and Cleary. Yeah. It's a sport sparrish kind of place. They have right. They don't give you the menu on a football do you? No, they have regular tables away from the bar completely separate. Are you talking to that thing because you're like off mic? You got to put your mouth right on it. Oh, Hank said his mouth is not on the wall. I don't know what I'm going to do when Hank probably got similar taste. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, possibly. Yeah, we could probably get in trouble together. But um, no, I don't want to go out and spend 35 bucks for a steak that I could get there for 18. With all my money. You're making good. I got like you just making big bucks. It's got a $600,000 house. No, you're talking years ago, dude. Before you got divorced and I taken the cleans. Yeah, yeah. I'm just your average Joe trying to raise a family. When you got kids in school and they're all the bills going on and taxes and everything that's going on here. You know, there's nobody with a lot of money anymore. This this fact is actually rabbi, George. This is ridiculous. Good. Well, package. Alame sandwich. Okay. Well, pack you a Gambian rat. A kosher one. Here's a facet about that after the break. Um, I'm in fact. I think we're going to prove a point to Jeff. At most of our listeners are going. We'll prove it in a minute. The giant Gambian rat is a marsupio that looks like a rat. They used to be in the remake of Ben or Willard or whatever. Oh, they used to use Gambian rats in those movies. Remember Willard? You ever see that in that Willard Ed Ben and the remake. The Michael Jackson and that's what I think Michael Star going off just a little bit. Start giving two closer than little or three things. And I think he's there. Go off the deep end right at that point. Anyway, let me do a break. What am I doing here? Oh first you don't want to talk about this because it's Todd Rexicon. We all know about Todd Dreck Don't wait. 10 minutes past noon at 5.60. The WCWM don't forget we got their hurricanes and a girls team Southwest Missouri state come up into a clock from Omaha. It's door die. If by some bad stroke, a lot they lose today. They come home with their tail like a more Suplial rat right between your legs. You were really embarrassing and bad news. You didn't notice by the way that the hurricanes lost 13 to two in the marlins on the same night lost to Texas 13 to two. Do you notice it? Shocked and unhappy. But forgetting about unhappy and shocked, but isn't that one the most bizarre coincidences? Yeah. How low can they go folks now the financial first of all he doesn't know from a pipe smoke right now. He's like uh you're enthusiasm is just you know something he fits in perfect in this town. I come back here. I've been away for two months. I think, oh the phone is going to ring off the hook. It's going to be exciting. We had to big blow up with Joe Rose and mold where we can and I might as well be talking about and then into this 10 thing here. The lunch is great. So by the way. Here's my question again. How low can those interest rates go? Now financial group does the limbo rock under the lowest finance rate you've ever heard of. How low 1.95%. That's true now. You can refinance your homer buy new homer get a super low 1.95% financing with the natural group. Call them till free and find out how this works. Call 1-800-940-00 That's 1-800-940-00 and if you even think about refinancing or buying real estate, call financial group 1-800-940-00 and you talk about savings. If you have a hundred thousand dollar loan, your payments are only 360-8 If you have a two hundred thousand dollar loan, you pay only 736 a month. So confidential group. If you're looking for 1.95% interest rates are all time low and now's the time to make that call. 1.95% from financial group 1-800-940-00, that's 1-800-940-00 and D. There were an equal housing lender, credit restrictions apply and rates of due change monthly. 5.19 apo. 5.19 apo. Hi, this is Hillary Clinton. I hope when you run out to buy my book, you won't be too shocked to discover I have a fat-**** swinging under my skirt. But you can't blame Bill, he certainly not gay. I just had the credentials every politician needs to be a wife of convenience and it's pretty much ended with that. Bill is such a horned dog. He probably would have never noticed I had man like and Chelsea, well if you buy my book, you can meet all about the affair I had with Sandra Bernhardt and our lunch aisle. Now I wasn't born in a Democrat, I switched parties after looking in the mirror and seeing the body of Tip O'Neill. So buy my book now because I can never have enough. If you order a copy today, I will personally autograph the all-newed scratches and fold out. What are you talking about? Are you on drugs? They're in drugs in the other room. Time for a raid. We're going to change the poll because I want to you know, Jeff made a comment to me that most of the people are coming from this show to eat in his finest establishments are Jewish. He said, you know, most of your audiences do a shit, so no they're not. How many times do we don't know as religious polls? About 30. Yeah, we're going to do one more time. 10% or so it comes out. It's always about 10%. Which is more than the general population, but it's certainly not a lot of people think this is a just because it's a Jew radio station. We got Moan Gildi. For all is like the token goi. You got Hank. You got me. You got eddy K. All the all the stringers. Beast Josh. Jim Manich. Joe Rose. Right. Right. Carlos Sanchez. Beiner boy. All Jewish boys. Setsburg. Josh. What's his name? Cortis. Cortis. He's a going. No he's not. Yeah, he is. I checked his Jewish. Not a hurry. So what work changed the poll? Let me show you the results of this one. It just didn't make him. It just didn't go over. Plus they were busy here talking anyway. 185 votes. What's the place you've never been to that you must see before you croak? I thought that's a pretty interesting question. Huh? Vietnam. Vietnam? Why do you want to see that? It has something to do with sex again. Is that all you know? It's just Christ. All this man knows is getting laid. That's the only thing he knows, which is why he's our kind of guy. But even so what does Vietnam have? I don't want to hear. I don't want to hear about it. I know it's going to be a bad question and even worse answer. Yeah, he's saying you're right. No, I know him. Okay from a long time this man Hawaii 43. But and believe me, why is beautiful? You ever been there? breathtaking and you know people say what you live in Florida? Why would you want to go to the beaches? I mean, I was going to ask you that was so silly. It's so ridiculous. The beaches there are so clean. And a water and a Pacific Ocean is not only much warmer, but it's so clear. You could see like almost to the bottom. I mean, it's just unbelievable. Even different than the Bahamas. I would go to the Bahamas if you paid me by the second. I never vented the beaches. Okay, so I'll plenty of beaches, but I was there with the beaches in the Bahamas. That place is the biggest rip off. The biggest scam. This is one of the biggest things that's wrong with South Florida is the Bahamas. If they would just take the whole Bahamas and sink it like Atlantis? No, it's here. Am I right? Look, we then we'd have to get casino gambling. And Mickey Urus and couldn't keep hopping up all the canbers on his damn 40-millimeter cruise ships where everybody keeps dying all the time. We wouldn't have to worry about that. And then this place could go somewhere. Oh, no, the Bahamas want they treat you like crap. The Royal Bahamian hotel in Nassau. This is years ago. In fact, it's so many years ago. It was back on W. Snoos before even you were a sponsor before. When I looked like a cow, right? Like, which picture? What were the big penis? I'd ever had a big penis. Okay. I'm sorry. I did. I was very jealous. Anyway, how when we got to get that mode picture runner, the new one? Well, we're working on the contest at this point. We're working on the couple's contest, but I think he might qualify. Just all by himself. So anyway, the Royal Bahamian hotel, it's in a middle of the summer time. It's 145 degrees in the shade. And forget about the fact that on the cruise ship on the trip over there, the ship is heaving and we're heaving and they end just everybody is puking their guts out in seasick. And we finally get there. The cab ride from the hotel because you know, it was like from about here to the wall back there. A 30 bucks ride. That's right. How much for the cab, man? Where are you going? Oh, about right over there you sit. About 30 man. Yeah, where would it have led is? I'm about two more blocks. About 30 man. And then we in the hotel, everything was like wet dog. You know what I mean by wet dog? No, it was seriously like wet game being red. Mill dude, like my apartment announced it Oh, no, you're home. Come. You don't want to go back there because it sucks because it's oldie and moldy old and moldy. Okay? By the way, you got a good friend that can't go back to Amsterdam. Do you know that he slept at a homeless shelter tonight? I don't want to say the name on the ear. No, wrong fact guy. I don't want to say the name on the ear. I didn't say it on that. I don't want him on the ear. We got no problems with him already. Just got massive problems. You know, sometimes in life you push things a little bit too far. You're in me. Wanting to push to you know to stand up for what you believe in to make a point. But as you become older, hopefully you'll learn from your mistakes. But sometimes you become older. You get a little bit like you're pointing with your finger making round, you know, crazy emotions for me. Now what do that have to do with my so anyway, the walls and the carpeting are soaked from the humidity because there's no wheel air conditioning. And he's so tough. Now this granted was years ago, but even so when you have experience like that, you're not going back. You're not going back. And the sheets, you get into bed at night and the sheets are soaked. It's like you just took the sheets out of the washing machine soaked and you haven't even done anything on them yet. And they're already wet. You don't want to say it's just I'm sorry. So what were we saying before to the Bahamas? You said, um, but going, oh, so we're going to change the pool. Here's the result. Hawaii 45 New Zealand 43 Italy 35 Cuba 25 you'll be sorry to he need 24 Montana 13 prog 13. That's what I voted for. I want to go to prog and Omaha one. That's a good choice out of 200 votes. That's not a bad choice. Let's change the pool for Jeff Cohen's sake. In fact, we'll get some calls from some goyum. No, because you, you're, I can't believe that you really believe that. That's what did you say? What do you say about 70% of the audience is Jewish? I think so. Based on one, based on the people I see come in the restaurant that mentioned your name.

So let's find out from this audience. How are we going to do the pool? I know you're busy with a half couple of contests. But at the same time you don't have to screen the calls. He's sitting in that chair. You're looking on a bright side. You got that big check in your pocket. It's not any good. But you know, you feel like you got some money? No, that's an older kind.

What are you and now what what religion are you? I mean, let's I mean, what are you? We could have like category asshole. We'd have a lot of hosts for that. Then Mo would get out there.

When he sees swinging mo, believe. They'll be in heaven. It'll be a real a real treat. What religion are you? Jewish Catholic Protestant Protestant Protestant Mormon 17th Adventist. It should be what what religion. Where you born Buddhist because some people that do. You can do Muslim. 80th. Right. No, not religion. Are you born? What does that mean? Because what is up on my. Some other point. You're saying is that somebody comes in your restaurant. They got a big nose automatically. You're assuming their Jewish. Not at all. Even though they may have converted to Catholicism and they have like a big crucifix around it. But I'm on fixed the big nose. Just like you get a nose jump? 20 years ago. That was before I knew you. Well, it looks much better. Thank you. How do I know how it looks? Plus I don't really care. Okay, so that's the new pool and I will work. Who's that online? 12. Batline. It's a facts. Oh, is that?

You answer your phone and it's a recording. Yeah. Thank you for taking a lot of those last time I phone. That was long as it takes to hang out about two seconds. Yeah, but it's a payment actually got to stop what you're doing and answer the phone. So we want some not just Jeff's client.

Wasn't born yet on my KT days when we're on the the Jewish station to sell the Miami Beach station. And our sales manager used to say, can we stop people calling us the Jewish station? You stay a bit about that. And our sponsors were like the famous restaurant, you know, and uh, a bunch of Jew places because all we had was like 80 and 90 year old Jews. Of course the said part of that is now they're all dead. There's more to take their place old Jews. By the way, Jeff's got a special for all the old Jews out there's got an early bird starting next week. Sure. Not.

So glad your back in town says, Jessica, I fast you several times in the past few weeks, but that drooling waste of seam in Georgia never. Never. Never extended to you. That's a great line, Jessica. That drooling waste of seam in. I guess it's because you can't handle criticism. I was wondering if Georgia says wooden as he sounds because he has no personality on the ear, especially when you're on. Jessica, that's Chris. He won't. What is it? It's Chris. That's a guy. That's his stick every day. He only gives. I can't read that. Or both boards of sarcasm that are neither clever nor funny.

I mean, granted when he doesn't use an voice when he's using his own voice, he's about his boring. He's been all putting.

A place, a city, a state, a country, a joint. By the way, you know to speak in the joints to round or the cops don't have an affinity because there's no laws anymore. It's in limbo until he finalized the decriminalization. Oh, seriously, there was a story on on Saturday, I believe. But what was where they showed kids actually, reasonly, not only smoking, but blowing the smoke toward the cops. I mean, not right in their face, but blowing it out of them because they know they can't do anything because there's no laws on the books. So they're not even writing the tickets now because they decriminalization takes still in limbo. Oh, that's the politicians fault. What do you mean by that? That's not that. I mean, that's that's ridiculous. How people out on the streets don't that. decriminalization is one thing. Wait. I like saying I want to make this be a lot the audience to know that this man's legs are crossed. His eyes are crossed. His fingers are crossed. That even his testicles are crossed right now. He's sitting on a chair. Not true. But I'm not sure. I understand there's anything wrong with it. And I like the criminalization and everything else. But I'm just saying to have people out on the street corners, whether it's drinking alcohol, smoking dope or not. They're not drinking alcohol. They're not drinking alcohol. Right. Okay. Well, they should be smoking. They're out there. Why not? Because it's just like cigarettes, smoking anything else. Your father. You're putting it on. So, other people are smoking outside now that's bad too. If it's in a surrounding where there's other people. out on the streets. People walking down the street. Okay. And there's other people. You're smoking a camel. You're being a real macho man and you're puffin' away outside. What's there vizis a make? I don't want to breathe it. Yeah. Choke on it. Yeah.

All the fast moll over the world are coming to get married in Toronto now. That's right. I saw that on that. That is correct. See, I'm the stay and now a good part of the year in a place where it's like progressive and you're like a lot into a place where we're taking gigantic steps back into the stony. Right. That should have legalized gambling. Should have legalized gambling. Should have like gay marriages. We should have a free dope for everybody. Legalized prostitutes. You have to say that off. Might we all believe in that. Legalized prostitution. Look at what it works. Look at the way this station goes. My god. I can't think of a more above bigger but you're prostitutes and all of us have worked on this place. And I lead the pack. And I'm proud of it. That money goes right to the bank. What religion are you? I just keep mentioning this because you're open for that Jewish never to go away. It's not going to change that much tomorrow morning. It'll be different. Maybe not what I'm going to be less. Now what I thought that I think it'll go up. It'll be less. Okay. You know your balls better than me. You've done this many times. I'm going to be a man. He's all of a sudden not always he'd have pizza expert in the garlic roll expert. He's the goddamn demographic expert grasping for straws because you're full of crap. And I this is a good education to you. Okay, which is a good sign. It's a good sign. It's good. You want it a why? Because you've you've got to Jews rounded up now for business. Now you need to go after the go I am. There you go. See? Look at all the other potential business we got out there waiting for the great food of the pizza love.

I never dreamed we'd be doing a religion pool, but see and of course I can't blame Jeff because we always used to think the same thing right what? That they were more Jews listening in a audience. I never thought that and also the egg not was because you chase most of my way But also the agnostic in the atheist I assume that a very high percentage of those were Jews and before they just Realize with the world of all crap as matter fact, but they weren't more than half the Jews I've met have become ATAS to agnostic but they weren't not an ass on it. You let me finish the sentence. We've done that poll and they weren't most of them were Christians Probably a lot of them Catholics who you know saw to a whole bull crap, you know Really old man in the dress that exists all these people carrying around his big heavy wooden crucifix Like the one that was on the wall a lot of cusher four.

You know and she had the big pair to stand up for against the radio station It's managed to tell his shove it and it gets small potatoes like smeg green and Tell her where to stick it to Hey I want much better pants with my career with a life You can't get out more moke to right away in here. Hey, you want something to eat what you got Nothing but I can pull something out of my ass now more I got it going. I'm starting a new business. Oh, no Good, yeah, I'm gonna be a hooker. I'm proud of my mum. Hey, oh, yeah You sure you're also free Oh, I can tell you hey, what are you? I got a good spot. Oh, no, no, I don't know what you're talking about you just look at this so boy first What not Irooping as few as my got this place as a mess and here, home like I'm We got a loser. No! No! Move going in this front-press ticket. Boca Rato Flan! No! Come here, brother. I'm hungry. I just like to see. That's a lovely dress you got on there, y'all. Oh, my! Thank you. I am hungry. But you're free, brother. I feel like running dumb as free. Hey, you! Look! I'm a naked man. You want to make me proud, asshole! Who took you out of a miscellaneous? I'm turning into a white-brick, my highly desirable ass. I'm a naked man. You're a naked man. You're a naked man. Can't I have a great day, all this? Hey, you, you, you! I'm a naked man. Take a look at this hair. Get him from the pool. Hey, you got her hair, drop me. Oh, I was on radio, y'all. I was on radio. Just so gunnettled into one field at things. Rolls! Rolls! Rolls! I'm on radio. Rolls! Rolls! Rolls! Rolls! I was on the radio. Rolls! Rolls! Rolls! Okay, low. Good. Up and I decided to stop by. See how you were doing. That guy, guy. Oh, this is terrible. No, no, no, no. One 18-560W people were looking at it, they said it had to be back in town or what? No, no, no, no. Plus you said it sounds better in Toronto anyway. You said the microwave sounds better. You said it sounds better. You said it sounds better. You said it sounds better. You said it sounds better. You said it sounds better. You said it sounds better. The first day back, I'm just here for a few days. What did I just do? Take a big crap. But hey, that's coming. I ate it. Right. And that's going to make you sick. And fat. And then I'll have another stroke, another pulmonary embolism. Ambitary pulmolism. That's a mention you're girded. And have it on my girdle act up. I'll be like, puking my gut. I said that's a good idea. I'll allergic to this place. This place makes me sick. It more ways than one. It really does. I'm not... Look, I don't care where you live. But I think that there are a lot of people Maybe they live someplace almost their entire life. But then they finally realize I've been here too long. See? So that's why being able to do the show in Toronto a good part of the year. Except when it gets colder and hell up there in November. But it's a wonderful thing. Because I don't have to be a prisoner to being here. In fact, even for real, who was given me the business. Oh, you gotta get back down. Yeah. He realizes not that's ridiculous. He admits he loves Toronto. He likes it even better than New York. He would give his life not to be able to do the show from some civilized place and not be here. He's not a dummy. He realizes he's in God's waiting room. That's why he's going out of South Beach. Get him a big penthouse apartment down there. Now, you don't think they're doing a two hour show from 8 to 10. He's really making a kind of money that he can afford a penthouse apartment on a beach. Of course not. So you know that whatever is in the wings here. I mean, at least Gildy give him some credit. Okay. You never Daniel in Lines then. You remember the handwriting on the wall? Right. See, Gildy at least is sharp enough to see. The handwriting on the wall. As opposed to some people who are in denial. Luckily a pastor there in denial. And they just refused to say, Oh, well, that's going to be great. See, I guess he's assuming that if Gildy leaves, then it's a logical team. Him a team him up with the forlph at a morning show. Is that going to have a course not? Then the Chinaman Shanson hell. That's going to happen. Maybe he'll do updates. He can do the updates. Like on the Joe and Mark show would be good. Between two and five. Forlph 5 to 10. Us 10 to 11 30. 5 6 7 0 5 60. So when we're after today, Guess how many shows I have left before you start to Ska-mer schedule Mr. Hachut before the July. 10. Then Marine O'S Number lucky 13 13. There's George's football knowledge. Right. All his force knowledge wrapped up in one word 13. See, he knew that. Yeah. We just finished with Friday the 13. And I'll have 13 more of these shows. Not that I'm counting. I thought I'm kind of like, Yeah, because I realized everybody's gone anyway. That was a pleasure. And now that we're back on 10 to two, this is like getting my life back. And of course, I could go through a big thing. Oh, thanks to Greg. No, not no thanks to Greg. He deserves a smack in ahead. For a screw on me up for a year or a plus for a year and a half. In which I had a stroke and I was done here for seven weeks at a time. Sitting here getting fat or in fat or in eating and getting fat or in less and less active. When I just walked to the convenience store to get newspapers and soda into Ronald, I'm doing more walking just walking to the store and going back home. Then I do a year. This is a place to get sick and die. Not necessarily in that order. Well, you could park your car at the saw grass and then walk home. Yeah. Right. And at 14 feet of water, they used to be the parking lot. Sure. There's nothing in here. Are you sure you people don't have SARS? No, I'm not sure. Which doctor to Couner, by the way, is one of the big Couner. One of the big, a medical hot shots in Toronto. He started suggesting that the US has a much bigger problem than they're admitting with SARS, but they were a lot about that. We wouldn't lie on that. They shashed him up real fast. They said, they said, you don't think we got problems with the exporting beef and stuff like that. Just wait until you see how angry. And see they get the V have vased. Yes, that's enough of getting back at him. What they call it is pneumonia 3. Now, if you do a Google search, being a boy, do a search on Google for SARS or enough for pneumonia 3. And the fourth definition is SARS. So they can categorize it as pneumonia 3 and just pretend we don't have a SARS problem here. They could call it happy, fun feeling illness. They could call it monkey love virus. Monkey lovepox. Anything. They can call it licky henny. What's the name of that hen? Henny Penny. Licky, licky, licky, henny Penny. Fire us. I didn't say pull it. I said keep on. I was thinking about him. KOM. KOM. Yes sir. Tiger, remember Jones? That was a no. That was a grace. Maybe it wasn't. I think he sounded too much like him. It was a great picture of the thing. He just sounds too close to somebody we don't want to talk to. Okay. Change your voice. Call like this next time. WCOM. Pretty good. I was listening to that show on Saturday Live with a Joe. It must have been something live. I like Joe a lot. Except my wife won't let me watch a channel 9 because of that Beno Schmitt and that that's gonna keep or whatever that terror whatever. But anyway, I'm a little bit after he made those comments about the moey. The only thing that sucks is that I have to sit to that next to that bastard. I'm gonna play. I'm not bad with this. Really? I guess it's a dolphin plane there. They must have signed seats or something. Well, what does Joe do when I'm a dolphin plane? I give him covers it for a channel. I see this reference channel 6. You keep saying channel 9. But last time you're coming on your cable program. You have a little bit of cable. Can I say a lot of them? We just got out of hospital. Sure go ahead. My cousin Roger. He had that stomach reduction because he was on the verge of, you know, borderline down there. And he's loading you. And he's listening to you. He's already lost 50 pounds. Alright. So I just want to say thanks and glad you're home and see you have him to run. Thanks, Pally. Alright. Keep up the good work, Roger. Okay, lose that way. Don't be like the beast. Don't like backtrackers. They're gonna start getting like a disease on the end of your nose. I'm telling you, that's just the beginning of a Pinocchio nose like Baba Head. That thing is going to go right about 15 inches. But he did give us some good, oh wait a minute. Wasn't him always just some unnamed fat guy that gave us the information about guilty this morning. Good about any kind of fat guy. Good about any little short rock 10. Could have been Josh Freeman. He's not here. I'm a little bit of an fat boy. I don't think he's in the building or they could have been who the engineer. But he's not here no more. No. So I guess it narrows it down pretty much. Five, six, six. Hey, I don't care. He wants to play. And he's so compulsive. He doesn't really care. You know what I'm saying? In other words, he's such a compulsive yentre. But even if I out him on the ear is Thomas all this stuff. And you know, see he's now working most show anymore anymore. So then making a difference because now he's with Ferrell. And he's then this way's got that brown spot on the end of his nose. So he doesn't give a crap about that. Now he doesn't have to suck up to more. He had a little episode of the copying machine. Do you hear about that? No. And he had a copy the log or something for Ferrell show one morning and Mo was out there standing up against the machine. And he said, Mo, how are I? I guess you should have called him. How are they got to get out of my way? I got to like I said. He said, be sure to get the knives out. You heard that? You heard that? Fucking in the getting the again soon. I've found out. Everybody else is a backstab or mo accept you. Everybody else is out of line accept you, Mo. But I never expected all this momentum when I got back to town. You know, I thought kind of thought that now we shoved him in the middle of the night. He was small potatoes. But in his case, it's no mental until he closes that door and has asked the last time. I don't think that's ever going to happen. I wonder what the Humper is thinking about. Thanks, God, how the nice day off the day. Nice going up for our wet, but you, he's a. It's crazy. I'm so excited about this. In fact, you know, that's an excellent pole for tomorrow. What person inside, what QA personality despises Mo the most. The most. Yeah, go to the answer. Now that's a tough one. I don't know who I vote for. I'm not even sure if I vote for myself. We need to have a contest. Yeah. Like a slot fighter, something or like those padded. Clubs like they have on the American lady or maybe a civic cat pole would be good. A tug. A tug of war on the old. Peace. What religion are you asking in pole number three today? What was your pole intensive today? You know, nothing like it in three poles in one day. Catlach 83 agnostic 62, 80 59, Jew 46, 15.3% ponytail. Protestant 26, fundamentalist born again, Christian only five. Not too strong there. Not too bad. Hope you have a good life with your president. Wicked in four, Muslim three, Sikh three. We got three Sikhies out there. Bonus two, Christian scientists appear. Seventh day of NS1, Scientologist one. Hindu one and Mormon one. Would that. Oh, did you see the, I talked about it last week. The invasion of the Mormon. Bugs. What they call as Mormon. Crickets. Yeah. Thank you, Carlos. Thanks, Carl. When he knows because I gave him the story. They look like grasshoppers. They look like mean. They look like kind of the more Howard David of grasshoppers. What makes the Mormon? They're wearing a tie. No, they have magic underwear. Which protects him from the environment. Is there like two in their way through Iowa and Nebraska? David, oh, did you hear what I just did? He's proud. I know I did a forl. I think it's contagious. I think there's something he's got. Forgive us. Forgive us. Forgive us. Forgive us. Forgive us. Forgive us. I'm a traitor. This is for 257. I'm a two-way. Okay, thank you. Hey Steve. Hey, Jim. Say, did you get an haircut? No, boy, because there's something different about you, but he. What's different about Jim? He just asked his doctor about Viagra. Hey, Jim. Have you lost weights? Nope. In fact I've gained a few hinses if you know what I mean? Viagra. It can change the way you feel. Ow, who just broke me in the ribs? Oh hi, Sam. Have you even worked enough? Nope, but I'm feeling pretty pumped up. See the difference by aggregate and making your life. Oh, Jim! I pocket fishermen in your pants? No, but I am in the mood to throw for snapper. By aggregate, it'll change you for the better. Hi there, Jim. Say, did you get a raise? Yeah. You could say that. Ask your doctor about a free sample of by aggregate. But please, wait until you get home to say, go on. Ah! Oh, shit there! Speaking of that, we had a great surround a website was the yesterday or Saturday. Why do you kind of like slothed over a new, uh, from under the other? He, I think he must be doing like heavy drugs on a weekend. What on the week? Because the sadder, I mean, heavier than usual. Because the Saturday story is now kind of like sloth over an early Sunday, which actually in a way that's good. Because otherwise they have to wait till like later and he have to noon before it. Looks like we just kept the same crap on here all weekend. We don't get as many hits and then Eric hits all been out of shape. Woo! But, what? I didn't think that was a very good imitation. I thought that was kind of weak myself. Look at that. This man is purple in the face. He might have a stroke in there. Maybe it's your turn this time. Good. Look at it. Look at it. We were here all day Saturday. And the internet went out here. Yeah. Oh, that's why you didn't get the other stuff on there. Oh, so, woo! Haha. So, Eric, well, let's just sound that bad people make some time. Okay? Eric up there. Oh, no, he's gagging off. No. It's a good thing we got that ball game coming up. And nobody's listening. There would be a real trouble. Get on this high pressure. What is it? Oh, my god, if I could get a million people after my got these two going right now. I'd be worth 100 million bucks. Good, god, Eric. You're gonna get a ball. You're gonna get a ball. You're gonna get a ball. Really? Boca, Brian. He's hard. I got something for him too. Anyway, getting back to the Viagra thing, which is the reason I played it before he interrupted me with a bunch of hysterical laughter. The William Rigley company is patented away to make his double your pleasure slow and more potent with chewing gum containing the active ingredient in Viagra. Are you ready for that? Double your pleasure and double your fun. But with about eight years left, I'm fires his own patent for Viagra that make her a double mint and juicy fruit as no immediate plan to market such a product itself. There's been no development activity whatsoever in her as any anticipated present Christopher dammit. Wouldn't that be great if you could just pop a stick of juicy fruit in your post? And you're all of a sudden you had this wicked erection like for hours and me. I want the gum that makes you limp. We found dozens of patents on an annual basis with interesting retry in comments. He said whoever this Christopher worker, but there's a huge difference between filing for a patent actually developing a product and finding what it's exactly right for commercialization. The gum would have to be two to at least 30 minutes before sex also similarly Viagra time parameters. The application also suggests the gum might be a better vehicle to deliver the drug right in the bloodstream since it releases the drug more gradually than Viagra's pull for. Which has caused gastrointestinal problems for some men. How do you like that? And since they played the cubs play in really field, and Philip really was the one who like founded a franchise. They could like hand it out right and it would come to him. Okay. Then Sammy wouldn't be the only one with court in a better pants, huh? Anyway, this is also a big enough of a patent your pants. Popstar Brittany to get heaving bosoms in the UK. Oh, right. US popstar Brittany Spears is to get a pair of inflatable throbbing breasts that will pulsate and tend to are dancing at least her waxwork model of Madam Tussos Museum in London. I wonder if they have the because there's a Madam Tussos in Amsterdam, which you don't want to go there by the way, Amsterdam blows now. But they have a Madam Tussos right down or by the damn square. You know that damn square? Damn it. And I wonder if they have the similar, I don't know. You think they would all have the same stuff? Are they like franchises of each other? I don't know. They're they this kitty corner McDonald's and Kentucky fry. They're plans to make a new figure of Brittany Spears a spokeswoman said on Friday she'll be very sexy and she'll have heaving bosoms, but this is only the very early stages of planning of development so to speak. She said the model would be based on one of Brittany's videos which he dances breathlessly around a pole. No, not yours. It would be accompanied by professionals who would teach museum visitors the tricks of the trade. The initiative is the latest by the museum to make his models not just visual but tactile. Brad Pitt has got a squeezeable latex bum. But Brittany, that's just so the Brits are so stupid to read. It's a funny thing. Can't say ass but he's got a latex bum but Brittany would be the first with heaving bosoms out of the spokeswoman. Can you imagine the size of the bum? That's the jail always figure could have. God, take up a whole section of the name joint. He being, maybe he being, I'd be even just thinking about seeing it. 5, 6, 7, 0, 5, 60, power to a screenless here today. Not much of a response to everybody's other town. They were used to it. A lot of stuff going on inside. Heavy duty inside. What do we ever? Oh, how do you man? Woo! What religion are you? This is pole number three for a Monday. We got 344 votes. I just mentioned that in passing. This is just, this isn't even really a pole. Just kind of like our survey that we do not usually is often but just a passive I jiff Cohen. He wants him to go in his customers. Catholic 95, agnostic 68, atheistic 66, 52. That's my favorite station. You 52. What do they play there? All day long. Oh, it's that. Oh, it's that. 252 got a 15.5% Protestant 28. Fundamentalist board again, Christian five and the wicked four wickens. We got four wickens out there. Or which one you like best? That one. We got four wickens. Boy, let's not have that conversation again. I got a headache just thinking about that. I still, I don't understand that. Well, we, and then of course we also have the travelers, but that's not a religion. That's a cult. Yeah. Well, that's a group of people. A group group. They might have a religion, but it's a ethnic group. Yeah. That was a religion. It came hard or Walmart. Oh, speaking of Walmart by the way, we hate them like toys. I just mentioned that. Not for a special reason. Just because of many special reasons. For a lot of special reasons. Because like I said, we hate them like toys. Why in local? We're sports radio five, 60, like you, A, M. Boss knows a boss. Spreading like crazy. Boy, spreading their charms. Be here. Soon they'll be buried. And eaten by worms. Be here. People don't come together. People may stay apart. You want me to search the others? Nothing can stop it now. No. Because we are all scared of some. Here you are. Don't go to Asia. Don't go to Hong Kong. Stick clear of Toronto. If you want to live long. People don't live forever. People must all be part. But no one wants us to happen now. That's why we are scared of some. So who would you like me? People don't come together. People they stay apart. Okay, so 141. We got the Marlins. We got the Marlins. We got the U of M. Hurricanes. We got them and Southwest Missouri State. That's a Southwest Missouri State. A girl school for a handicap. Big College World Series game. Colle up to a clock to 7. Would you as a geeky and a clearance? Or is down Bailey, Jr. And the beast and the council. The beast is not out there. The beast got left here. They shine his ass. That's right. The shining is bitter. He's a bitter young man. He's running around the spread of like gossip. In fact, if he can't work here anymore, he's going to go to work for Rente Yenta. How much? How much in a while? He looks. Anyway. This is a distressing thing. So we got seriously. His clearance on those games and I, does it say on the schedule I wouldn't say it does? He is on those games. How embarrassing. Here's what I got. It's supposed to be our program director. I don't want to like bust his balls because he does give me a paycheck on time. Program. Let me tell you when you know a guy's been doing much, much too heavy drugs and drinking when he was sunglasses inside. There's only to look. Two groups of people who do that and that is super ultra stylish Hispanics and Italians and drug addicts. So which one do we think beiner boy? Well he is one and thinks he's the one. I said super stylish. Not guys that were like a crappy, crappy cap. Like an army fatigue cap, whatever the hell thing is. What is that? It's a kangaroo's hat. It's a rude cap. Yeah, what's worth my book? Man, that thing is nothing. He thinks that the sunglasses make people not notice how high he is. Is that what it is? Yeah, that's a good idea. Scott Peterson fetching loads of letters. This story makes me one of them. But it's so typical. It is so typical of America's infactuation and love affair with scumbags from Charlie Manson to Sir Han Sir Han. I mean you name it. They never found a scumbag they weren't obsessed with. Oh Jay. Oh Jay. And John Hinkley. And Ted Bundy. Michael Jackson. No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not talking about those scumbags in prison, which he belongs to, but he's not there yet. Scott Peterson charged with murdering his pregnant wife and the unborn child as we see being stacks of letters and jail. Many of them from women. A fellow when they told him a desto be newspaper that Peterson's correspondence for the woman serving time for murdering her husband. Oh, and if he went and get together, he could be a nurse. A guard read the letter allowed and make Chris Young said. Peterson is pleaded innocent to double murder charges that make a military for the death and early out of y'all. Last week, a judge issued a gag order barring lawyers. What is his and police officers from public discussing details of the case? Judge Al Jeralami said the gag order was the only way to stop leeks and rumors from the reeling his right to affair trial. Stanislaus County Sheriff Deputy Tom Leetris confirmed that Peterson gets more mail than the case. But when the library, that's typical. It says it's not uncommon for young men accused of terrible crimes received letters from female admirers. Oh, a lot of sick women out there. A lot of really desperate sick women. You think that clearance may be my people to hit late because he just doesn't know where to find the right ones. Maybe he spends some time in prison. He is the program director of this radio station. I think that's a big step in a right direction if he has to. A lot of criminal activity going on on this schedule. All of the summer may be corrected soon. Five, six. This, this just caught me totally. I got out of my car. I went up the elevator. I knew Mo would still be here because I saw his big tanks sitting out there. And I figured maybe we'd bond a little bit, you know, hello, goodbye, and that, which is what we did. But little that I know that there was going to be, because I didn't know what that point about the Joe Rose thing, which we will play again before the end of the hour. Huh? Don't you think that would be a real good lead in as we get to her at her comb basepal time. I think it would be great. It would be great if we went out. In case anybody missed the Mo and Joe confrontation on Saturday. Bring it. Yeah. The Mozo Joe confrontation. Don't forget we're going to have Swing in Mall on our website sometime, and maybe for the day is on also how we do it on a hot couple's contest. We at least have all the pictures that we got quite a few, actually. Like 11, 11, 12, maybe. Like I said about it doesn't. Is it what I, yeah, about it doesn't give or take? Baker doesn't. Or a Jewish doesn't. They'll be up sometime. Baker doesn't. There's a Jewish doesn't. There's a Jewish doesn't. But at any rate, they'll be up there like when. Some, some to the area has everything. Sometimes. Oh, hurt you. Sometimes. And just as you said, the phone rang and there's Erica in the phone would be to where, oh, you know, something this is worth coming back for a week. Just a, you know, it's one thing they hear about it and talk about it and have you been to me, but to actually actually see him pick them, phone off the hook. Oh, the name isn't even off my lips yet, nobody's either. Oh, just having an office having a cow in Orlando. Maybe it's the same cow that did that number on a great morse show. I'm to tell you the truth. Boy, how's that religion pull a comment for Jeff Cohen? What religion are you? What we do this about Anna, what about once a year, about. So this will be the one for this year. I don't think we've done it a long time. 100 Catholics 72 agnostics 68 atheist 56 Jews 15.6%. That's a little higher than usual, but we'll see if that stays, you know, Protestant 32, fundamentalist born again Christian five, Muslim five, Wicken five, Buddhist four, Sikh three, Hindu two, two Hindus. Yeah, it's a re-efficient, like we're going to experiment come. Christian sign is two, Mormons ones, seven day Adventists, one side tells us one. We lost Mormons, you know, where did we go wrong insulting their tire? The magic underwear, right? The tie and the fact that I never saw that Mormons, I think that those young guys that come with a nice white shirts and black ties. Do you invite them in for non-capital? I've never had one come to my door. The only the only assholes I ever have ever had in my life come to the door, the one of the other ones. J. W. You're home as witnesses with the watch tower ever since I was a little kid. They were in fact in candidate when New York on a weekend. They'd come pound it on the door. Oh, the end is coming, that was like 100 years ago. That was the silly New Year's ago, the world was ending then, still it's still here. The watch tower, the good news is the days are coming, bad, bad by me, all this other crap. And then when I lived in Hailea, right next to mommy like, sither, I had the, I totally, that Sunday morning's story. Nine o'clock at the morning, banging on a goddamn door, wake me up out of a sun, sleep by go to the door. Get out of here, you know. And then they go down the hall and then they got some other Getski comes in here and he doesn't realize that they've already made their rounds on this side at all. And he's like this. I said, take your watch tower and you jack ass, take your Stone Age, Hocus, Pocus, Mumbo, Jumbo, and go enjoy some New England gumbo. Get out of here. Trangier, I just can't handle it. Just like this, why, how many years have I been telling you all this stuff? They shouldn't report anything and happens in the Middle East ever again. Ever again. And then it would stop. It would stop. There'd be no more settlers making illegal settlements because nobody would be impressed by it. There'd be no more Hamas blowing people in everybody up because nobody would know about it. Just stop talking about it if they want to kill each other. Great. What? Let me ask you this seriously. What business do we have? Why should we care? Which shouldn't. Why should we care about Israel and Palestine and trans Jordan and Jordan and why should we care about an endocrat? They got any oil? No. Are they a threat to us? No. So who now gives a crap? I say, let's go in here and bomb Saudi Arabia. My life and love all. This is Fort Radio 560. You're way too way, yeah. The most innovative science fiction film in decades. And now the long awaited sequel is here. And it's not only innovative. It's inebriated. The Matrix. Moated. What is the Matrix? I know. What's that Samuel Jackson over there? Hey, Sammy! I am Lawrence Fistler. You're talking fool. The Matrix loaded. The sequel that's six pack with excitement. Intrigued and a lead character who makes even less sense than he did in the original. Where? Where? Where? Where? Your film and aliens are using my body as a fuel suit? That is correct. Well, I'm going to get more creeps out then. He on a reeds his back. Dotting bullets and fart caps in slow motion in the Matrix loaded with carry and moss as his sexy partner. Yeah, but it did become the spoiler that the Matrix often came. Leave me alone. I lost my phone number. Can I have your two? Two. Drinking the greatest sequel of all time. But Matrix loaded. One, 53 and five, 60, 21. We got the dolphins and the marlins in the dolphins plan. Next. What? It's all the same difference. Hurricanes, marlins, not so. Another stop-floated desperate situation. Of course, if the Hurricanes win, they played a marinated clock. Right against some other against Texas, isn't it? I do believe. Texas or Rice or Boins or Game. And if they lose, it's by by. Now, I did promise something. And I'll almost forgot. I want to give you an update of what took place just now off the year. Because I think it's important to hear this. Howard just called the radio station Howard David. Who I get along with great. I thought he called me an asshole. Saying I was trying to stir it up. My point back to Howard is don't listen. Listen to 101.5. Let me see what age group. 101.5 for Howard. Maybe 102.7. It's an easily listening, love music. So you could focus on your wife and your family and the grandkids. Instead of listening and always calling the radio station. He's becoming Howard the caller. Like Howard from Boca. Howard from Boca. It's like, you know, it's okay. So anyway, he's he's listening. So just want to get the message out and don't call my show to. Just for a record. Don't call off the air because I don't want to talk to you. And I don't want to hear you on the private line. Congratulations. You know the private line number. That's great. But don't call because you're not coming on this show. You've got your three hours five to eight. Monday through Friday. You can talk all you want, but you're not coming on this show. And we'll leave it at that. All right. I got nothing against you. You seem like a decent person. And I know you've been getting that taking a big hit on the radio station from everybody else. And deserving of it is over. Me and you done. You asshole. I mean, like that. One of the great moments in broadcast history to place right here on this radio station on Saturday. On the little dog Joe Rose show. I just I just wanted to make sure that everybody in town got a little taste of it. Yeah. In fact, here's a fact that says. Our regarding today's poll choices can be added unaffiliated none of the above. All of the up now. Regarding Moan is radio problems. If QAM totally dumps the most there are most in the 5 AM show. Well, QM dumping from the offense play by play. Rizzi and Miami dolphin employee on that one. The latter is correct. He's employed by the offense. And regardless of his situation and a morning show at 330 in a morning whenever he's going to be on, he still got to dolphin gig for 2 years. Most of him manages his never clicked on the broadcast and never will. The guy that replaced the that more replaced bulls him for would at least laugh with and share the spotlight. And when it was great days when it was like, It's not like we're having a hell of a lot more fun together. And share the spotlight with Mad Dog and his men's systems that we all love and cherish. Most of your calls the game like the Mike spotlight is his and his only. He wants to hog the mic. Plus while I'm in the bitch mood, hey, Mozo, I'm tired of walking all over the, you walking all over the Mad Dog and his men's systems during the games. Stop it and share the spotlight. You assholes his KP and throw a deal. A little bit over the top there, you know what I'm saying? But I do understand his point. Well, Mozo has come in here like a whirling dervish. He promised he would derrient event. Talk radio or sports talk radio. And I think he has. I think he's brought it to a level that we never dreamed. Well, we could possibly sing to and it's pretty amazing, you know, when you put your thumb right on it. So what do we got today? We got kind of a because of this unexpected hurricane game in the middle of the day. Mad Dog's off today. The humpers off today. Well, I'm sure enjoyed each and every moist moment during those replays of the Joe Mo call. Actually, it wasn't a Joe Mo call on the air. We just geary spawning. I'm sure the humper enjoyed every moment. Well, by the way, spirit of the humper, I had to thank you up. And now see how you do that to me. I know I just do that to myself. All of a goddamn time. I go to one spot to offer me. WTOAM Miami for Lord. See there you go. What we got? What? I love the way Hanks said that. WTOAM Miami for Lord. Yeah, I just kind of like, you know, I can't be rather with the script. I don't blame him. If I'd have been in this place as long as he has it to be a miracle that I could even show up. And of course, that's why probably isn't going to be here today. Now, I'm law enforcement. Oh, we could have hank coming for a half hour after the game. I said, you don't want to do that. You're going to make a man like hank coming here for a half an hour. You don't do that to anybody. Maybe mole. And then we got after the hurricane. Examiner, I forgot we have another we got the Marlins on deck. The Marlins and the Metz tonight right up to street at P.P. Park. Aren't you excited about that? The Marlins and the Metz who are in a neck to neck. No, Stano is death battle for last place in the National Agree. And they are right on top of it. You remember, our those the Marlins that were going to win 91 game? You know, that this one uses me about the sports talk assholes before the season started. There was not just one, but a whole bunch of these idiots calling it on the sports station. Calls show them his station on a Marlins are going to win 91. Why not just say the Marlins are going to win 150 games this year. You're going to pick a number out of your ass. I think the Marlins are going to win 163 games this year. How do you like that? One more than a whole goddamn schedule. Oh, we don't we don't have time. We're going to do the one moment please. Oh, I got to queue up the longer one because we got to get it up to you and baseball. There we go. Speaking of you and baseball and drugs, I'm sorry. Those are old storage long ago. Old on the hospital, we don't want to rehash the old Muslims at hatch. So stick around for a big game man. It's door dive at Hurricane Zulke. They'll beat this roasting probably about 15 to 3. Which is it? Huh? Why do you have your fingers crossed? They're going to do us though, good. How many runs you think they're working to get a score? About 3 to man. Don't forget you're going to get a Marmorning 10 to 2 right after a frail. The old diner and drugs. Say it dude. You've earned a bed and breakfast. We got the diner and drugs. Break it baby. Break it. The coma inducing Joseph Gackie. And Clarence who couldn't get laid with a fistful of 100 Amsterdam and the red light district. They'll be along for a moment. How do you give you an update of what took place just now off the air? How many times you're going to play that? About 3 to man. How many times you're going to play that? About 3 to man. How many times you're going to play that? About 3 to man. Let me join in Miami for a loaded. All right.
