Some of it will be reinvested in a new game slow to a lot of resource woman Sheila Griffin said keep in mind Lottery's the biggest rip off the biggest legalized rip off an history mankind in my right One person's finding about the ticket my Hamid I see him hosting owner of Cole's food market in North Bay village Still got his cut as the vendor who sold the winning numbers the lottery paid him 10 grand I gave some to a friend of works with me and sent him to my wife in Bangladesh, Wisconsin The only problem is he might not be so happy if he checks with the hernphines out. She had a 50 million dollar ticket to light bitch. I mean It says if the ticket holder finally shows up And we'd have a five box of clean-ex Party because he or she would be crying. Yeah Griffin said How do you like that? Who the hell is Griffin? Oh Sheila Griffin from the Florida lottery? Cryin and if you seriously stop to think about that you'll look in the drawer. Oh, look at that. There was my lottery ticket There it is. I've been looking for that damn thing and of course if you don't write down the numbers You just and you look at it and there's like 22 23 35 45 50 and 53 and then you reach in the other dry Call up the revolvers You have to you just have to can yourself. What do you absolutely rubber room at least? I want to mean another winners guy. You see here. We kind of like George you're becoming very cynical about our great colors Here's Palm Beach.

Which of these best describes by you listen to the Neo-Wraggie show for humor? For liberal talking if you laugh There's nothing else on I hate Neo, but I can't turn it off Neo is the radio god. Oh God. I'm a QAM listener or I love the crank colors Which were two for two so much the first guy was good though. Yeah, that was date retired. That was the god with the 85 horses I started to enjoy him actually, you know what he's got something good like that No, he was good today. It's because to show you if you just keep plugging away sooner Lady might have something like mo you know Some day he might say something good on here absolutely haven't had nothing good so far But it's only been like a year and a half and you say that he's got such great hits in it in addition to what he does have a lot of hits mostly Once you don't want like I think I'd hurt you like that one It was out sick with like a churpee and like a little extra crotch right yesterday come on mo booch up a little bit If you got to work on this station you got to show up or be like the rest of us by the way mad dogs off today You know I'm saying oh right That's like because we work whenever we feel like it because we got a Marlon game pregame at 1235 The Red Hot Marlins vibe believe are they 15 games over now Scott 15 16 16 816 85 oh my god They are they are assured of not having a losing season I Don't want to doubt your word, but I want to look in the paper here.

Oh, there's nothing worse than a shameful tool Right our symbol of decadence to the perverted West Let us beware of her dangers and be careful so that a poster on the site Barbies a threat The poster plastered with pictures of Barbie and short dresses and tight pants With a few of her accessories reads a strange request a little girl asks her mother mother I'm on jeans the low-cultured and a swimsuit like Barbie Such posters are distributed to schools at Hongian streets by the religious police or moot moot moot moot moot hawa moot hawa Whatever it held it okay goyem and Independent body affiliated with the office of the prime minister vice police officials weren't available for comment Shek Abdullah al Murdaz a preacher in a re-admosque said the mutal would take their anti-barbit campaign to the shops confiscating dolls from sellers and Imposing a fine How do you like that? Oh, we're fine right although illegal Barbies the creation of California based Mutal are found on the black market where a Contramandal could cost a hundred reals which is 27 bucks US or more It's no problem that the old girls play with dolls, but these dolls should not have the developed body of a woman And where we're feeding clothes armor does said these revealing clothes will be imprinted in their minds And they'll refuse to wear the clothing where used to as Muslims the Sheksei as in Shikibudi Isn't that incredible?

What does that say? Oh no, who is that a cave in pronouncing name Larry Hobas? Okay, is that as you don't know who that is Sergeant Carter But is that his name Larry Hobas that sounds right Actrine comedian best known for his role as Sergeant Carter on the long running TV show Hogan's heroes he was also regular on Gomer pile U.S. MC well guess what He died and also Ronan Martin's laughing who guessed that a numerous game shows during the 70s including match game and the Liars Club died September 90th day of cancer in San Marco's Texas age 67 Larry Hobas I have no idea who that is Sergeant Carter he was the I didn't watch hobing heroes great No, it was not great. Yes, it was what you never watched it Well, maybe that's why I don't know was great. It was funny didn't watch Gomer pile U.S. MC didn't watch that It was just silly I did watch Ronan Martin's laugh and I don't remember no Larry Hobas though I watched match game religious though love match game is still on the game show channel all the time Never seen what your harvest is kind of like any pencil leki kind of guy the Liars Club wasn't that with who was on the Liars Club was that Mike Stoki who's also on Panama quiz. I don't know was the host on that I don't know somebody will let our park Brian or one of those old guys will let us know But we very hovers who I could say but then I'd be lying Stars from Hogan's heroes. It's his and his facts are dropping lifelies. Well, God damn And he's just to help a lot of that death going on, you know what? What are all these calls on here? I got just too much stuff. We only got till 12 30 and then you know me 12 30 I think a few of these idiots on here's poppin. Oh, hello Hi, Neil. Yes, sir. How are you sir? I'm doing great good the first one was the first time I've ever called I usually don't have time to call you. I work for living right and What if thank you really you're a very funny guy in fact I'm a who bright I don't even understand how you can attract an audience with you both you and your your extremely intelligent right Yeah, I don't know how you get an audience down here. I wanted to discuss a little bit about this religious Fanaticism and have the answer to the world. Hey, all the time you like Yeah, I don't know if you're a fan of Bill Mars I think no Mars. I don't know right don't know. I think Bill Mars and Ansel but anyway But basically he said that you know religious finance is dangerous So the Islamic finance is in the very dangerous because we feel like they can just blow themselves up and take everyone else with it The Christian fundamentalist are least amusing. They're They are they're amusing well ask the abortion doctors who got shot and killed well They're missing are not take everyone with them Yeah, that's care. I'm not a she's called the people who died in the in the Crusades and in the Spanish inquisition if was music. Have a nice day sir Come you Is this guy do I he's a bill Marfane. I mean you're going to be a rich in asshole No, I don't want this guy to take it personally because he likes us but his call is horrible So you know keep listening we hope you listen, but your call was wrote test and unacceptable and it's just Unconstitutional that you would say says crap about the fundamentalist Christians are amusing Not only are they not amusing they're annoying they're obnoxious they're dangerous they're crazy people and This is what the problem is is that America takes it all too lightly see we're talking about religious extremists See this is the reason that the mainstream media because they're so afraid to lose sponsors and offend anybody That's why this whole thing would 9-11 there's very little discussion about religious extremism except the course with A Muslim extremists yeah, they're the only battles right there are the only bad ones and you recall that people like Billy Graham Sun Franklin Graham and all these others in the beginning were making these growth test as usual comments about Islam and all well That's really a violent religion and all that stuff you know as opposed to Christianity and the other ones Which and Judaism which the Jewish god was telling like spite all of their enemies make sure they don't miss any You know Religing as sick there's there's it's not a debatable point. I mean you people at our brain washed and can't Mittally emancipate your brains from all the religious indoctrination and bullcraft. Hey I understand It's not easy From the moment that you're old enough to understand even before you really comprehend they start hockin and bangin and then they're in bangin and then they're that's what the Alterbar said it keep bangin it in there.

Why do these little cries? I think it's a punk out of my mind. I think the US intelligence headquarters, including four Americans, a Kurdish security official said today. The US military and bagged at heads said six Americans were wounded. Later said four intelligence officers were heard along with a Kurdish Peshmerger guard at the building. You know those Peshmergers? Who? The Kurdish official who spoke on the condition? I was thinking yesterday again. I could go off on a long rant. We don't have time today. But how is it possible that the public is so God them stupid? Like the thing with a Taliban? All of those years went on. Nobody gave a flying thing about the Taliban, about the women with the burcas, about they couldn't listen to the music, how repressive they were, and about the Spartan existence that these people were forced to live on. Nobody cared until after 9.11. Then all of a sudden we started seeing eight billions to every day. They were like, oh, another whole bunch of stories. About the Taliban and repression that they voiced it on the poor Afghan people. Did it? How many people in America really gave a flying crap about Afghanistan? Don't tell me about 30. We wouldn't like five. Even the Afghan hounds didn't care about it. The Browny hounds didn't care about God in Afghanistan. It couldn't fight it on a map with both hands. And then all of a sudden here comes the American media are the enablers. There were ones when able Kenny Star and all of our wing Republicans do all that penis gate with Bill Clinton. There were ones who made the whole big saw today and they made it possible for us to get as far as all an impeachment waste millions of your tax money and are the same ones who are letting this asshole off the hook, who just raised another three million bucks down there in Florida over the last couple days. Just great shame on you as Michael Moore would say, but in this case I'm talking about the freaking American media. It's a pretty sad commentary when he takes to amy fate and to the true. The media is sick and he's not badly. A media sick and we need to help badly. That's the problem. Anyway, the answer all Islam organization with suspected times to be a kid was formerly based near some place that I can't pronounce about 30 miles east of Erbil near the Iranian border. Answer headquarters was bombed by US yesterday in the war. Surviving members of the group were thought to have fled to Iran. They're now believed to have returned to Iraq, which is now becoming a hotbed of terrorist activity, which it wasn't before we started the Iraq attack. The operation Iraqi freedom. Right. How do you like them apples huh? I'm saying that again. Let me say that anymore. Don't say, I'll hit you know what I get. We all do that. We get on for some of the mistakes in your mind. You're saying it. Don't let me do that no more. Okay. Because some things I mean after while it gets to be irritating. Even though it might be too like a thick-out of herpes. Like most say in that this morning, a thick-out of herpes. How did that mo? That would be irritating. That would be a thick-out of herpes. Firstly, your herpes on a scalp under his eyes. I think he had a scalp glued on to tight. That's why he was out yesterday. So he's got herpes under his ear. He had a peel it off. How is that pull coming? This is our first pull. We got the important one. This is just, you know, just for clarification. I think it's kind of interesting. Don't you want to once in a while? No. You know, you know, like this pull? Of course I like this pull. Well, don't you get that. I mean crap. Nice. I'm like Scott there. See you trained in bed. You trained him so badly. Hey Scott, pay attention to George. Beiner Boy was paying attention to George. Look what happened to him. So he wasn't. 226 votes so far. Which of these best describes why you listen to me. Or I'll just show for a liberal talk in a few laughs 84. I think that covers it, right? Sure. You're a little bit more god 65 for a humor 48. There's nothing else on 10. For people who don't like Dr. Laura and Russian. All the other crap that's on when we're on. But that's a good excuse. That's why I put it there. I love the crank callers nine. I'm a QM listener six. Pretty weak. Duff. And clearance. Pretty weak. You should be bringing us more to the table than that. If we had. We were on like a talk station. I'm not talking sports talk. Are you like I would be used to be. Right. Great for about five minutes. If we wanted that, then we'd be cycling a tremendous number of listeners from the other shows on a station. And we could get instead like a 10 or 11 shareman. We could get. Right. But we're stuck with whatever we got. I hate Neil, but I can't turn it off for and I like Neil's pull, which Eric being very cute. spelled P O L E cross to that put P O L Q Derek. He's getting almost too good. He's scary. He's great. He's great. So we take it. See, this goes to show you. As long as you're still breathing, it's never too late to be rehabilitated. Absolutely. No, not you, Mo. You're there's no hope for you. It's too late. Carol King wrote that song. It's too late now. Number of the name of the song. It's too late. Yeah. It wasn't name of the song. You know what? Carol King. She couldn't sing it out of a paper sack. What did she write? She wrote some good songs though. Carol King. Like a hundred. Did she? Well, about there. She wrote a lot of music. She couldn't sing for a shmit. It can't like Bob Dylan. Bob Dylan wrote great music though. And couldn't sing it all. No, he not a note. Just annoying and whiny. FCC says Howard Stern's Rachi Radio Show is a news program. I didn't like that. Nice going, howie. When you think about news shows, what comes to mind? It says there's meet this on CNN's website. There's meet the press and face the nation. Of course, if you do a good job on meet the press. Oh, you're in. Rule the world. That was another memorable call. That got that asshole. Oh, you know, something this, this, you just facts me. That was going to. Oh, this is got to be on the pool. I will have to leave this up there to like 11 30 or something. Do you want to know why? I don't want to. Hi, this is Sunny Fox. I listen to you, or I just could like hear the word asshole. Right. Because I like to hear the word asshole. Let Eric, I hate to force you to pull one more on here. It's my bad. Because here's the facts from Ralphie. You said I listen to your show because I like to hear the word asshole. So that's the other choice, honor. I like to hear the word asshole. Speaking of which, I saw God wearing a t-shirt that said, my mother told me I could be anything I wanted to be. I decided to be an asshole. To which we say, yeah, what's wrong with that? What's wrong with being an asshole? Anyway, getting back to this story about Howard sperm, the federal communications commission ruled yesterday that Howard's Ranshee radio program is a bona fide news interview program. The decision was in response to request made by the New York based infinity broadcasting ink, which wanted a ruling that its widely-syllicated steering show is a news program an exempt from equal time requirements for political candidates. The decision will allow steering to put actor Arnold Schwarzenegger on the air without having to offer equal time to the scores of other candidates running for governor in California. Siding an 84 decision that the qualified the Donahoo talk show for news exemption. And of course, don't you always think generally of Phil Donahoo and Howard Stern like in the same vein? Oh, I don't even know what's being that Howard is still on the air. The FCC said there should be room for less conventional interview formats to increase coverage of the political process. Since the Donahoo decision other news interview programs are segments there are what unique and innovative format elements such as the Sally Jesse Raffielle show Jerry Springer and politically incorrect with the Uxious idiotic Bill Marr have qualified for the news interview. You know, Bill Marr is just a putts, you know? I wouldn't even say he's an asshole. He's a putts. He's just very, he's ineffective. He's like a poor man's dick caven. Right? I kept that. He's just a wimpy little nerdy guy. I know that stupid, stupid, stupid book about if you ride alone you're riding with those psalmers. I mean, what a stupid bunch of crap, you know? And then every Anna Huffington who lately's been writing some good stuff, but you know, what was the one that she wrote? And she's had the same thing. Something like that, right? Some of some, if you drive it as you be your terrorist, something like that. Some similar kind of crap. Can't stand Bill Marr. See, that whole politically incorrect thing to people, wow, you know, he's, he's anti-establishment and a big deal. Who cares? So, for out the source of rathnader, what what he do for us? So, look what he helped us get. Look what he, look on you people that voted for Nader in 2000. Shame on you, man. Shame on you. Including Michael Moore as much as I love Michael Moore. He voted for Nader. And speaking of Donahue, he not only voted for Nader, he was a bang in the drums. He was the, uh, the cheerleader. It is pompoms out. Remember that? I do. I mean, yeah, I'm not saying it rathnader is not some very good points, but the pomp, the point is that, uh, what's the sense of throwing your vote away? So, and it isn't what I was screaming back then. I was screaming and look what we got now. You were the jacko. Look what we got. He warned everybody. I warned you. You vote for Nader and throw your vote away. It'll be close enough. They can like, we zled us thing in there. And they we zled their way in, man. There's nothing worse than a goddamn wezel. That's what they did. Snake this, uh, bunch of goiemen there again. The bush, your misters. See, this is supposed to be a democracy. Eh, not a goddamn monarchy. And between the kin of these and the rock of feathers and abusches, you see what it's all about. Handful of very, very dubious, suspicious wealthy families who acquired their wealth, most of them through a buy hook and mostly by crook. Just like joke Kennedy with his goddamn bootlegged. How's Brian Greasey's toe to it? Every time I hear that, I think. Why is that? Brian Greasey. I don't know why. I don't know. I've got it. Maybe spread a lot of time and answer them. He belches a lot. I have told you by the way that an answer to him. It's considered to be in, it's not considered to be rude or in bad taste to Belts in public. In fact, it's like, Yeah, it's just part of the, uh, ambiance. Great. You know that? Nope. I do know. Well, now you know that. Just think about it. And there were about 400 people showed up at that protest yesterday. Look at that. Like I said, we got a lot of stuff. A lot of fish to fry and so little time. So little time. Plus we got these great calls. They're a whole bunch of money. Which we might get to or not is the case. Maybe I'll get to you just relax. Okay. Got nothing else going on there. Did we add the other category on there? Because they want to hear the word asshole. We got that on there. Yes. One vote already for that. That's my bad. We should add on there right from the beginning. Probably sunny fox voted. 1056 at 560 WQM announcing a brand new aspect.

What was that Hank Goldberg? Stopped! What was he scored a 20-year-old in LA? 19 Chicago, 20-inch, early 25, and used in World of 26, shared Vegas. How do you like that, says Miss Fudge? What does that tell you? There's something really, really sick and wrong with America. If people are watching, what would be Goldberg? I'm seriously, I can't, I can't physically, oh, but I'm just, she's nauseating. Yeah. Plus I have an aversion to the whole roster lock thing anyway.

President Bush collects $3 million of Florida fundraisers. Oh, this just makes me want a puke! Oh, shut up, mighty! Yesterday was a $3 million day for El Presidente, as his reelection campaign at a fundraising jackpot by a bunch of crackpots in Jacksonville and Fort Lauderdale. The twin Florida fundraisers brought in a half a million dollars more than the Bush team had expected to pick up. The events propelled a present's reelection campaign, conference past the 62.4 million dollar mark. The centerpiece of his four-literalistso article, by the way, in a sense that we're written by the Uxius and Heidi Humphobic in disgusting-looking buddy nevins, speaking of assholes. The centerpiece of his four-literal visitor list in four hours was at a crowded reception at the Hyatt Pyrus 66 resort on the 17th Street causeway for two grand a person about 500 contributors got cocktails or durs and the president's 25-minute speech. Across the street, about 400 demonstrators chanted slogan, some of them have seen buddy points up against the president and the war in Iraq in one of the few large south-loaded protests rally since the start of the war. There were some of the things that were yelling, Randy, there's nowhere conditioning on this freaking bus. Where is the early bird? Vosha Online is a achievements to largely Republican audience in a well-secured ballroom. He was repeatedly interrupted by a plosman he talked about the war on terrorism. The president was introduced by his brother, the extraordinarily anxious governor, Jeff Bush, who told the crowd, imagine what the world would look like if my brother was elected in 2000. You know that really? You know something? Yeah, what are we talking about? What's the fire? I want to read that line. I'm just reading an over-dober until a ballgame starts. Imagine what the world would look like if my brother was elected in 2000. Which, of course, the first of all he wasn't elected. That's number one. But number two, and you know what this is? See, my psychic powers again. I was talking before about the Ark Dark Funko song. What a wonderful world this would be. You sandcook some of these stool. Imagine what a wonderful world this could be without El Presidente, without this one. If they wouldn't have been able to steal the election with her friends, and they sued the bloody John. Jeff, think this is a pre-ins done at peace. But all. No, that's my bush allergy's act enough again. Man, I'm real allergic to bush. Okay, let's wrap up this first puller. Get the important one on here as we try to solve the promise of the world here. WHAAAAW! 290 votes. I'll start a kit to 300, what do you say? Okay, 300 and an hour is pretty heavy, do you? Do you have to think? No question. Anyway, we got 290 right now. Which in these best describes why you listen to the Oradur Shri, I won't read it till we get to 300. Huh? Imagine what the world would look like now if my brother was elected in 2000. That's you. What a sense of humor, huh? What a real comedian. Jeff Bush, hi, the man! Yeah, now he did it to us. He had groupsets with the entire state of Florida, Jeb. And then of course, he says, well, I've got Devious plans for that for that the constitutional at the school size amendment. They don't tend to public pass is it? And he starts unleashing his Devious plans and tries to like, twirt the world of the public. Like you guys didn't really mean this, did you? I mean, he comes right out. He gets caught on tape saying he's screwed up public. Okay, I've got some Devious plans for that. And the public says, hey, we like that. Let's put you back in there again. I'm starting to wonder if maybe Janet might have done a little bit better than Duel's McBride. Do you think? No. How is that possible? How can the electorate in Florida be so guy-dame stupid? Are they a bunch of mugwams? Yeah, I forgot. Man, that's astonishing to me. It's amazing. Here's the good news, though. Right on the heels of that about him raising the three minute bucks. He hasn't got a child in his chance. If he likes you, where tomorrow against any Democrat, I don't care who Duel was. They could bring back George McBride again. They could dust off water, Mondale. We lost him in a soda, even. And he still would be Bush. With the sweeping 6-1 vote, the Santa Cruz California City Council became the first local government in the country yesterday to ask Congress to look into a peaching president Bush. It's time for us to open up this can of worms of Councilman Tim Fitz Morris. No relation to Morris give, late and great. I was butchered in Samot's Ini. City leaders say Bush violated international treaties by going to war in Iraq and that the president manipulated public fierce to justify the war and on the cut cuts tooshinorites. And he is... Absolutely correct. The resolution authorizes Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Riley to send letter to the House Judiciary Committee Chairman James Sensenbrenner asking if Bush is committed any impetible offenses that could lead to his ouster. Yeah, that's only hope. The Council vote came in packed chambers where supporters of the resolution lined the walls some carried signs that read honor the Constitution impeachment now. Oh! And God bless and keep Bush out of power. What do you like that? I like it a lot. Uncentive of those signs was echoed by members of the Council of Odegan was 6-1. I happen to think what's going on is a high crime and misdemeanor but let's leave that to the US Congress to decide said Councilman and US and UC Santa Cruz Professor Mike Rockin. Tom Mullony retired that this was one of three people at the meeting with spoke out against the resolution. It's not an issue that the city council should be involved in this just serves to divide the community he be saying. Such divisive political stands aren't unusual in the coastal town. A year ago Santa Cruz became the first of what was photo 165 city councils to oppose the war against Iraq. Santa Cruz was also what a more than 100 cities declaring its opposite to the Patriarch. So did Howard County but the local papers that I want you to know about unless you were up to a two-inch still midnight. You assholes at the Sun suddenly use scumbags. You low-life to the generates. And in April the city and County of Santa Cruz sued the DEA in a Attorney General John Ascroff marking the first time a public entity issued the federal government on behalf of Patients who need medical marriage a whiny. So we love Santa Cruz California. You betcha. Some people with some real balls okay not a bunch of pansies who just roll over and play dead every time the goddamn government goose steps in their backyard. We love Santa Cruz right? We almost as much as we love Freddy Cruz. And the quiet storm. From it's past 11 at 560 WQML I can work up again. Hey that's not good. Yeah it is. It is. Well it's a short show anyway. That's right.

Take a whole bunch of really great calls between now and 1230. Here's Fort Lawterdale, hello. Yeah. Yes sir. Your next poll should be, Jeb's question. What would the world be like if his BDI to ask whole of a brother hadn't been selected to the White House? That's a good suggestion. Now also, I have a opinion and a story. Oh, a news story. I disrespectfully disagree with your previous caller who said that the criminalist Christians were amusing. They are as dangerous and as big a threat to the freedom and the life in the United States as any other group of religious fundamentalists wackos in the world. Absolutely correct. So the news story is from Alabama. Yeah. Talks about how the governor's request for a tax increase was rejected despite the fact that he told the voters of Alabama that it was their Christian duty to help the poor by shifting the burden of paying taxes more to the people who could afford paying taxes. And the comment in the paper was from a political expert in Alabama that Christians do believe but they also vote their pocket books. So what does that tell you about who their God really is? And once again, Alabama leading the nation in idiocy. Well, don't forget, Joja. Yeah, well, as the Sippy as well. Did you listen to the Democratic debate last night? No, I did not. They had some good lines in there. One of the questioners asked the candidates what their favorite song was. Yeah. And Al Sharpton had the best answer.

Yes, sir. Yes. Do you have to stop them? Why do you care? Final swarfe and anger is the governor of California. Because you have to ask me that question. Well, look. Let me just say one thing. Let me ask you this question. What's the biggest state in the US? Alasha. No, I'm not talking about the insides you're graphic. I'm talking about impopulation. California. Yeah. So in other words, you don't think it says something about the US or where the public is going. If we elect some stupid ass movie actor is governor. Hey, that guy could bench 400 pounds asshole. Oh, great. He can bench 400 assholes. He's a lot of assholes. Here you go. He can bench 400 pounds. Well, in that case, what about the Jack LaLay and he used to bench like 420? You didn't use Simmelton? What? Look. Did the right there? That was the by take back what I said before. That was the best call of the century right there. That was the reason I listened to this show plus I like the patient. It was the new criteria for President, I think. Right. If I maybe could sit on these Supreme Courts on day because he's good on the bench. 560 5060 pound 560 on the AT&T and Verizon Wireless line another ball buster. We're going to bust your balls kneel.

Yes, sir, what is to you? Yeah, I'm not talking actually in Tampa, but I live in Naples. I think it's Jim Chung, Neil. And how are you from Alpsham? Yeah, Jim Chung, Neil. Yeah. I think he's wanted him. What do you say? What do you think? Yeah. Oh, man. I love this show, you know what? Most of the paycheck, but I sure love moments like these. We've had such a, such a wide, and the paycheck. Yeah, it's really been great. It's been phenomenal. And we got another hour to go till the pregame show. You ain't heard nothing yet. Just wait.
